This is the methodology that we used to separate the FY 2006-based IPPS market basket professional fees category into professional fees: labor-related and professional fees: nonlabor-related cost categories. We are proposing to use the same methodology and survey results to separate the FY 2010-based IPPS market basket professional fees category into professional fees: labor-related and professional fees: nonlabor-related cost categories. We believe these survey results are appropriate to use for the FY 2010-based IPPS market basket rebasing as they empirically determine the proportion of contracted professional services purchased by the industry that is attributable to local firms and the proportion that is purchased from national firms., 275216=E. Proposed Update for LTCHs for FY 2014, 193254=Comments received timely also will be available for public inspection, generally beginning approximately 3 weeks after publication of the rule, at the headquarters of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 7500 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21244, on Monday through Friday of each week from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. EST. To schedule an appointment to view public comments, phone 1 (800) 743-3951., 73683=We are proposing to revise the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs of acute care hospitals to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems. Some of the proposed changes implement certain statutory provisions contained in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively known as the Affordable Care Act) and other legislation. These proposed changes would be applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2013, unless otherwise specified in this proposed rule. We also are proposing to update the rate-of-increase limits for certain hospitals excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits. The proposed updated rate-of-increase limits would be effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2013., 253536=e. Sampling and Case Thresholds for the FY 2016 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years, 219117=C. Adoption of the MS-DRGs in FY 2008, 559377=These same means of disseminating information on new, revised, and deleted ICD-9-CM codes will be used to notify providers, publishers, software vendors, contractors, and others of any changes to the ICD-9-CM codes that are implemented in April. The code titles are adopted as part of the ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee process. Therefore, although we publish the code titles in the IPPS proposed and final rules, they are not subject to comment in the proposed or final rules. We will continue to publish the October code updates in this manner within the IPPS proposed and final rules. For codes that are implemented in April, we will assign the new procedure code to the same MS-DRG in which its predecessor code was assigned so there will be no MS-DRG impact as far as MS-DRG assignment. Any midyear coding updates will be available through the Web sites indicated above and through the Coding Clinic for ICD-9-CM. Publishers and software vendors currently obtain code changes through these sources in order to update their code books and software systems. We will strive to have the April 1 updates available through these Web sites 5 months prior to implementation (that is, early November of the previous year), as is the case for the October 1 updates., 747766=In order to determine if hospitals adequately billed for the device, the applicant analyzed the cost of the device on each claim by summing the charges that map to the 15 CMS IPPS cost centers (77 FR 53340). The applicant then calculated the standardized cost for this subset of charges by multiplying the standardized charges in each cost center by the CMS national CCR for each cost center in the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 53340). The applicant asserted that, whereas all hospitals in the study were charged a uniform investigational price for the MitraClip\u00ae System, this analysis confirmed that some hospitals did not bill at all for the device or charged substantially less than the actual hospital acquisition cost, which is likely due to the investigational status of the technology. The applicant explained that the mean total standardized costs in the \u201cSupplies and Equipment\u201d cost center in the FY 2011 MedPAR file for MitraClip\u00ae cases were remarkably low for MS-DRGs 250 and 251, respectively. According to the applicant, the mean total standardized costs in the \u201cSupplies and Equipment\u201d cost center reflect only 50 percent of the actual MitraClip\u00ae System costs not inclusive of other supply and equipment costs associated with the MitraClip\u00ae procedure and hospital stay. Therefore, the applicant believed that Analysis 1 severely underestimated the actual hospital costs., 554756=The ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee holds its meetings in the spring and fall in order to update the codes and the applicable payment and reporting systems by October 1 of each year. Items are placed on the agenda for the ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee meeting if the request is received at least 2 months prior to the meeting. This requirement allows time for staff to review and research the coding issues and prepare material for discussion at the meeting. It also allows time for the topic to be publicized in meeting announcements in the Federal Register as well as on the CMS Web site. The public decides whether or not to attend the meeting based on the topics listed on the agenda. Final decisions on code title revisions are currently made by March 1 so that these titles can be included in the IPPS proposed rule. A complete addendum describing details of all changes to ICD-9-CM, both tabular and index, is published on the CMS and NCHS Web sites in May of each year. Publishers of coding books and software use this information to modify their products that are used by health care providers. This 5-month time period has proved to be necessary for hospitals and other providers to update their systems., 652331=As stated above, the new technology add-on payment regulations provide that \u201ca medical service or technology may be considered new within 2 or 3 years after the point at which data begin to become available reflecting the ICD-9-CM code assigned to the new service or technology\u201d (\u00a7 412.87(b)(2)). With regard to the newness criterion for Voraxaze\u00ae, as stated above, we consider the beginning of the newness period to commence when Voraxaze\u00ae was first available on the market on April 30, 2012. Because Voraxaze\u00ae is still within the 3-year newness period, we are proposing to continue new technology add-on payments for this technology for FY 2014. We are inviting public comments on this proposal., 514686=Under the IPPS MS-DRG classification system, we have developed a standard list of diagnoses that are considered CCs. Historically, we developed this list using physician panels that classified each diagnosis code based on whether the diagnosis, when present as a secondary condition, would be considered a substantial complication or comorbidity. A substantial complication or comorbidity was defined as a condition that, because of its presence with a specific principal diagnosis, would cause an increase in the length of stay by at least 1 day in at least 75 percent of the patients. However, depending on the principal diagnosis of the patient, some diagnoses on the basic list of complications and comorbidities may be excluded if they are closely related to the principal diagnosis. In FY 2008, we evaluated each diagnosis code to determine its impact on resource use and to determine the most appropriate CC subclassification (non-CC, CC, or MCC) assignment. We refer readers to sections II.D.2. and 3. of the preamble of the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment period for a discussion of the refinement of CCs in relation to the MS-DRGs we adopted for FY 2008 (72 FR 47152 through 47171)., 285053=Section 631 of the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA, Pub. L. 112-240) amended section 7(b)(1)(B) of Public Law 110-90 to require the Secretary to make a recoupment adjustment to the standardized amount of Medicare payments to acute care hospitals to account for changes in MS-DRG documentation and coding that do not reflect real changes in case-mix, totaling $11 billion over a 4-year period of FYs 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. This adjustment represents the amount of the increase in aggregate payments as a result of not completing the prospective adjustment authorized under section 7(b)(1)(A) of Public Law 110-90 until FY 2013. Prior to the ATRA, this amount could not have been recovered under Public Law 110-90., 444790=Based on these findings, we believe that it would not be prudent to eliminate the severity levels for the heart and liver transplant MS-DRGs. Our clinical advisors concur with this analysis that two severity levels are justified for the heart and liver transplant MS-DRGs. Therefore, for FY 2014, we are not proposing to make any changes to the severity levels for heart and liver transplant MS-DRGs 001, 002, 005, and 006., 237298=4. FY 2014 Hospital VBP Program Measures, 198215=ASCAAdministrative Simplification Compliance Act of 2002, Public Law 107-105, 643048=Monteris Medical submitted an application for new technology add-on payments for FY 2011 for the AutoLITT TM. AutoLITT TM is a minimally invasive, MRI-guided laser tipped catheter designed to destroy malignant brain tumors with interstitial thermal energy causing immediate coagulation and necrosis of diseased tissue. The technology can be identified by ICD-9-CM procedure codes 17.61 (Laser interstitial thermal therapy [LITT] of lesion or tissue of brain under guidance), and 17.62 (Laser interstitial thermal therapy [LITT] of lesion or tissue of head and neck under guidance), which became effective on October 1, 2009., 728942=The case-weighted average charge per case above does not include charges related to the Zilver\u00ae PTX\u00ae. Therefore, it is first necessary to remove the amount of charges related to the non-drug-eluting peripheral vessel stent and replace them with charges related to the Zilver\u00ae PTX\u00ae. The applicant multiplied the use of the single stent used per case by the average market price for non-drug-eluting peripheral vessel stents and then converted the cost of the stents used per case to a charge by dividing the results by the hospital-specific CCR (from the FY 2010 IPPS impact file). The applicant removed the appropriate amount of charges per case and then standardized the charges per case., 240105=b. Proposed Minimum Numbers of Cases and Measures for the FY 2016 Hospital VBP Program Outcome Domain, 840756=We created the processes described above to resolve all substantive wage index data correction disputes before we finalize the wage and occupational mix data for the FY 2014 payment rates. Accordingly, hospitals that do not meet the procedural deadlines set forth above will not be afforded a later opportunity to submit wage index data corrections or to dispute the fiscal intermediary's (or, if applicable, the MAC's) decision with respect to requested changes. Specifically, our policy is that hospitals that do not meet the procedural deadlines set forth above will not be permitted to challenge later, before the Provider Reimbursement Review Board, the failure of CMS to make a requested data revision. We refer readers also to the FY 2000 IPPS final rule (64 FR 41513) for a discussion of the parameters for appeals to the PRRB for wage index data corrections., 537550=Alternatively, the complete documentation of the GROUPER logic, including the current CC Exclusions List, is available from 3M/Health Information Systems (HIS), which, under contract with CMS, is responsible for updating and maintaining the GROUPER program. The current MS-DRG Definitions Manual, Version 30.0, is available on a CD for $225.00. Version 31.0 of this manual, which will include the final FY 2014 MS-DRG changes, will be available on a CD for $225.00. These manuals may be obtained by writing 3M/HIS at the following address: 100 Barnes Road, Wallingford, CT 06492; or by calling (203) 949-0303, or by obtaining an order form at the Web site: http://www.3MHIS.com. Please specify the revision or revisions requested., 263214=9. Form, Manner, and Timing of Quality Data Submission for the FY 2014 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years, 899078=With approval from the OMB, we contacted the industry and received responses to our survey from 108 hospitals. Using data on FTEs to allocate responding hospitals across strata (region of the country and urban/rural status), we calculated poststratification weights. A more thorough discussion of the composition of the survey and poststratification can be found in the FY 2010 IPPS/RY 2010 LTCH PPS final rule (74 FR 43850 through 43856). Based on the weighted results of the survey, we determined that hospitals purchase, on average, the following portions of contracted professional services outside of their local labor market:, 689622=With regard to the cost criterion, the applicant identified all discharges from claims in the FY 2011 MedPAR file for MS-DRGs 116 (Intraocular Procedures with CC/MCC) and 117 (Intraocular Procedures without CC/MCC) with the presence of ICD-9-CM procedure code 14.73 (Anterior vitrectomy), or 14.74 (Posterior vitrectomy). (We note that because no procedure code exists for this technology, these cases would include patients that are not eligible for or would not otherwise receive this technology.) The applicant found 199 cases (47.6 percent of all cases) in MS-DRG 116 and 219 cases (52.3 percent of all cases) in MS-DRG 117. This resulted in an average charge per case of $40,957 for MS-DRG 116 and $20,621 for MS-DRG 117, equating to a case-weighted average charge per case of $24,011., 627384=Under the second criterion, \u00a7 412.87(b)(3) further provides that, to be eligible for the add-on payment for new medical services or technologies, the MS-DRG prospective payment rate otherwise applicable to the discharge involving the new medical services or technologies must be assessed for adequacy. Under the cost criterion, to assess the adequacy of payment for a new technology paid under the applicable MS-DRG prospective payment rate, we evaluate whether the charges for cases involving the new technology exceed certain threshold amounts. Table 10 that was released with the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule contains the final thresholds that will be used to evaluate applications for new technology add-on payments for FY 2014. We refer readers to the CMS Web site at: http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/FY-2013-IPPS-Final-Rule-Home-Page.html for a complete viewing of Table 10 from the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule., 230182=3. Proposed FY 2014 Wage Index Tables, 864649=From FY 2006 to FY 2010, the wages and salaries and employee benefits cost weights as calculated directly from the Medicare cost reports increased by approximately 0.7 and 0.8 percentage point, respectively, while the contract labor cost weight decreased by 0.8 percentage point. As we did for the FY 2006-based IPPS market basket (74 FR 43847), we are proposing to allocate contract labor costs to the wages and salaries and employee benefits cost weights based on their relative proportions for employed labor under the assumption that contract labor costs are comprised of both wages and salaries and employee benefits. The contract labor allocation proportion for wages and salaries is equal to the wages and salaries cost weight as a percent of the sum of the wages and salaries cost weight and the employee benefits cost weight. Using the FY 2010 Medicare cost report data, this percentage is 78.3 percent; therefore, we are proposing to allocate approximately 78.3 percent of the contract labor cost weight to the wages and salaries cost weight. Table IV02 shows the wages and salaries and employee benefit cost weights after contract labor allocation for both the FY 2006-based IPPS market basket and the proposed FY 2010-based IPPS market basket., 217990=(Pub. L. 111-148), the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, 834110=If a hospital wished to request a change to its data as shown in the October 3, 2012 wage and occupational mix data files, the hospital was to submit corrections along with complete, detailed supporting documentation to its fiscal intermediary/MAC by December 10, 2012. (We note that this date was originally December 3, 2012. However, in a memorandum dated October 25, 2012, we instructed all fiscal intermediaries/MACs to inform the IPPS hospitals they service that we extended the deadline to December 10, 2012.) Hospitals were notified of this deadline and of all other deadlines and requirements, including the requirement to review and verify their data as posted in the preliminary wage index data files on the Internet, through the October 19, 2012 memorandum referenced above., 867649=In addition to the data from the Medicare cost reports, the other data source we are proposing to use to develop the FY 2010-based IPPS market basket cost weights is the 2002 Benchmark Input-Output (I-O) Tables created by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), U.S. Department of Commerce. We are proposing to use the 2002 BEA Benchmark I-O data to disaggregate the \u201call other\u201d (residual) cost category (31.861 percent) into more detailed hospital expenditure category shares. The BEA Benchmark I-O accounts provide the most detailed information on the goods and services purchased by an industry, which allows for a more detailed disaggregation of expenses in the market basket for which we can then proxy the appropriate price inflation., 916693=Depreciation contains two subcategories: (1) Building and Fixed equipment; and (2) Movable Equipment. The proposed apportionment between building and fixed equipment and movable equipment was determined using the Medicare cost reports. This methodology was also used to compute the apportionment used in the FY 2006-based index., 238865=b. Performance Standards for the FY 2016 Hospital VBP Program Measures, 912868=Due to the small number of children's and cancer hospitals and RNHCIs that receive, in total, less than 1 percent of all Medicare payments to hospitals and because these hospitals provide limited Medicare cost report data, we are unable to create a separate market basket specifically for these hospitals. Due to the limited cost report data available, we believe that the proposed FY 2010-based IPPS operating market basket most closely represents the cost structure of children's hospitals, PPS-excluded cancer hospitals, and RNHCIs. We believe this is appropriate as the IPPS operating market basket would reflect the input price growth for providing inpatient hospital services (similar to the services provided by the above excluded hospitals) based on the specific mix of goods and services required. Therefore, we believe that the percentage change in the proposed FY 2010-based IPPS operating market basket is the best available measure of the average increase in the prices of the goods and services purchased by the 11 cancer hospitals, children's hospitals, and RNHCIs in order to provide care., 651334=After evaluation of the newness, costs, and substantial clinical improvement criteria for new technology payments for Voraxaze\u00ae and consideration of the public comments we received in response to the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule, we approved Voraxaze\u00ae for new technology add-on payments for FY 2013. Cases of Voraxaze\u00ae are identified with ICD-9-CM procedure code 00.95 (Injection or infusion of glucarpidase). The cost of Voraxaze\u00ae is $22,500 per vial. The applicant stated that an average of four vials is used per Medicare beneficiary. Therefore, the average cost per case for Voraxaze\u00ae is $90,000 ($22,500 \u00d7 4). Under \u00a7 412.88(a)(2), new technology add-on payments are limited to the lesser of 50 percent of the average cost of the technology or 50 percent of the costs in excess of the MS-DRG payment for the case. As a result, the maximum new technology add-on payment for Voraxaze\u00ae is $45,000 per case., 546119=The ICD-9-CM is a coding system currently used for the reporting of diagnoses and procedures performed on a patient. In September 1985, the ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee was formed. This is a Federal interdepartmental committee, cochaired by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and CMS, charged with maintaining and updating the ICD-9-CM system. The Committee is jointly responsible for approving coding changes, and developing errata, addenda, and other modifications to the ICD-9-CM to reflect newly developed procedures and technologies and newly identified diseases. The Committee is also responsible for promoting the use of Federal and non-Federal educational programs and other communication techniques with a view toward standardizing coding applications and upgrading the quality of the classification system., 538537=Each year, we review cases assigned to former CMS DRG 468 (Extensive O.R. Procedure Unrelated to Principal Diagnosis), CMS DRG 476 (Prostatic O.R. Procedure Unrelated to Principal Diagnosis), and CMS DRG 477 (Nonextensive O.R. Procedure Unrelated to Principal Diagnosis) to determine whether it would be appropriate to change the procedures assigned among these CMS DRGs. Under the MS-DRGs that we adopted for FY 2008, CMS DRG 468 was split three ways and became MS-DRGs 981, 982, and 983 (Extensive O.R. Procedure Unrelated to Principal Diagnosis with MCC, with CC, and without CC/MCC, respectively). CMS DRG 476 became MS-DRGs 984, 985, and 986 (Prostatic O.R. Procedure Unrelated to Principal Diagnosis with MCC, with CC, and without CC/MCC, respectively). CMS DRG 477 became MS-DRGs 987, 988, and 989 (Nonextensive O.R. Procedure Unrelated to Principal Diagnosis with MCC, with CC, and without CC/MCC, respectively)., 875494=Table IV03 below sets forth the proposed FY 2010-based IPPS market basket, including the cost categories and their respective weights and price proxies. For comparison purposes, the corresponding FY 2006-based IPPS market basket cost weights also are listed. A summary outlining the choice of the various proxies follows the table., 191354=James Poyer, (410) 786-2261, PPS-Exempt Cancer Hospital Quality Reporting Issues., 250507=c. Proposed Removal of Hospital IQR Program Measures for the FY 2016 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years, 690459=The applicant then standardized the charges using the FY 2011 final rule impact file and converted the cost of the device to a charge by dividing the operating costs by a CCR of 0.50 (which equates to a 100 percent markup). Although the applicant submitted data related to the estimated cost of the Argus\u00ae II System, the applicant noted that the cost of the technology was proprietary information. The applicant then added the charges related to the device to the case-weighted average standardized charge per case and determined a final case-weighted average standardized charge per case of $311,180. Using the FY 2014 Table 10 thresholds, the case-weighted threshold for MS-DRGs 116 and 117 was $30,328 (all calculations above were performed using unrounded numbers). Because the final case-weighted average standardized charge per case for the applicable MS-DRGs exceed the case-weighted threshold amount, the applicant maintained that the Argus\u00ae II System would meet the cost criterion., 920587=Because capital is acquired and paid for over time, capital expenses in any given year are determined by both past and present purchases of physical and financial capital. The vintage-weighted CIPI is intended to capture the long-term consumption of capital, using vintage weights for depreciation (physical capital) and interest (financial capital). These vintage weights reflect the proportion of capital purchases attributable to each year of the expected life of building and fixed equipment, movable equipment, and interest. We used the vintage weights to compute vintage-weighted price changes associated with depreciation and interest expense. Following publication of the FY 2010 IPPS/RY 2010 LTCH PPS proposed rule, and in order to provide greater transparency, we posted on the CMS market basket Web page at: http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/MedicareProgramRatesStats/MarketBasketResearch.html an illustrative spreadsheet that contains an example of how the vintage-weighted price indexes are calculated., 389262=Beginning in FY 2007, we implemented relative weights for DRGs based on cost report data instead of charge information. We refer readers to the FY 2007 IPPS final rule (71 FR 47882) for a detailed discussion of our final policy for calculating the cost-based DRG relative weights and to the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment period (72 FR 47199) for information on how we blended relative weights based on the CMS DRGs and MS-DRGs., 261176=f. Proposed Timeline for Data Submission under the LTCHQR Program for the FY 2018 Payment Determination and Subsequent Payment Determinations, 251576=6. Proposed Additional Hospital IQR Program Measures for the FY 2016 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years, 782357=The proposed FY 2014 wage index values are based on the data collected from the Medicare cost reports submitted by hospitals for cost reporting periods beginning in FY 2010 (the FY 2013 wage indices were based on data from cost reporting periods beginning during FY 2009)., 951793=We note that, as discussed in section V.F. of this preamble, section 606 of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 extended the MDH program from the end of FY 2012 (that is, for discharges occurring before October 1, 2012) to the end of FY 2013 (that is, for discharges occurring before October 1, 2013). Under prior law, the MDH program was to be in effect through the end of FY 2012 only. Absent additional legislation further extending the MDH program, the MDH program will expire for discharges beginning in FY 2014. Accordingly, we are not including MDHs in our proposal to update the hospital-specific rates for FY 2014., 237225=3. FY 2014 Payment Details, 657530=As stated above, the new technology add-on payment regulations provide that \u201ca medical service or technology may be considered new within 2 or 3 years after the point at which data begin to become available reflecting the ICD-9-CM code assigned to the new service or technology\u201d (\u00a7 412.87(b)(2)). Our practice has been to begin and end new technology add-on payments on the basis of a fiscal year, and we have generally followed a guideline that uses a 6-month window before and after the start of the fiscal year to determine whether to extend the new technology add-on payment for an additional fiscal year. In general, we extend add-on payments for an additional year only if the 3-year anniversary date of the product's entry on the market occurs in the latter half of the fiscal year (70 FR 47362). With regard to the newness criterion for DIFICID TM, as stated above, we consider the beginning of the newness period to commence when DIFICID TM was first approved by the FDA on May 27, 2011. Because the 3-year anniversary date of DIFICID TM will occur in the second half of the fiscal year (after April 1, 2014), we are proposing to continue new technology add-on payments for DIFICID TM for FY 2014. We are inviting public comments on this proposal., 439850=We received a request from an organization that represents transplant surgeons to eliminate the severity levels for the heart and liver transplants MS-DRGs. The MS-DRGs for heart transplants are: MS-DRG 001 (Heart Transplant or Implant of Heart Assist System with MCC) and MS-DRG 002 (Heart Transplant or Implant of Heart Assist System without MCC). The MS-DRGs for liver transplants are: MS-DRG 005 (Liver Transplant with MCC or Intestinal Transplant) and MS-DRG 006 (Liver Transplant without MCC). We received this comment during the comment period for the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule. We referred to this comment briefly in the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 53325), but we did not address the issue because we considered this comment outside of the scope of the proposed rule. However, we are addressing this issue in this FY 2014 proposed rule., 365074=In order to implement the requirements of section 7 of Public Law 110-90, we performed a retrospective evaluation of the FY 2008 data for claims paid through December 2008 using the methodology first described in the FY 2009 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (73 FR 43768 and 43775) and later discussed in the FY 2010 IPPS/RY 2010 LTCH PPS final rule (74 FR 43768 through 43772). We performed the same analysis for FY 2009 claims data using the same methodology as we did for FY 2008 claims (75 FR 50057 through 50068). The results of the analysis for the FY 2011 proposed and final rules, and subsequent evaluations in FY 2012, supported that the 5.4 percent estimate accurately reflected the FY 2009 increases in documentation and coding under the MS-DRG system. We were persuaded by both MedPAC's analysis (as discussed in the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (75 FR 50064 through 50065)) and our own review of the methodologies recommended by various commenters that the methodology we employed to determine the required documentation and coding adjustments was sound., 225667=11. Proposed Changes to the ICD-9-CM Coding System, Including Discussion of the Replacement of the ICD-9-CM System with the ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS Systems in FY 2014, 545143=There were no cases representing shifts in treatment practice or reporting practice that would make the resulting MS-DRG assignment illogical, or that merited movement so that cases should logically be assigned to any of the other MDCs. Therefore, for FY 2014, we are not proposing to move any procedure codes among these MS-DRGs., 488845=In response to the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule, we received a request to develop a new MS-DRG for total ankle replacements, which we considered to be outside the scope of that proposed rule (77 FR 53325). We are addressing this request as part of this FY 2014 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule. The cases are captured by procedure code 81.56 (Total ankle replacement) and are assigned to MS-DRGs 469 and 470 (Major Joint Replacement or Reattachment of Lower Extremity with MCC and without MCC, respectively)., 204729=HIPAAHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Public Law 104-191, 227591=4. FY 2014 Applications for New Technology Add-On Payments, 802582=Using the occupational mix survey data and applying the occupational mix adjustment to 100 percent of the proposed FY 2014 wage index results in a proposed national average hourly wage of $38.2094 and a proposed Puerto-Rico specific average hourly wage of $16.5300. After excluding data of hospitals that either submitted aberrant data that failed critical edits, or that do not have FY 2010 Worksheet S-3, Parts II and III, cost report data for use in calculating the proposed FY 2014 wage index, we calculated the proposed FY 2014 wage index using the occupational mix survey data from 3,188 hospitals. Using the Worksheet S-3, Parts II and III, cost report data of 3,427 hospitals and occupational mix survey data from 3,188 hospitals represents a 93.0 percent survey response rate. The proposed FY 2014 national average hourly wages for each occupational mix nursing subcategory as calculated in Step 2 of the occupational mix calculation are as follows:, 898211=Similar to the FY 2006-based IPPS market basket, we are proposing that the professional fees: labor-related cost category includes expenses associated with advertising and a proportion of legal services, accounting and auditing, engineering, management consulting, and management of companies and enterprises expenses. As was done in the FY 2006-based IPPS market basket rebasing, we are proposing to determine the proportion of legal, accounting and auditing, engineering, and management consulting services that meet our definition of labor-related services based on a survey of hospitals conducted by CMS in 2008. We notified the public of our intent to conduct this survey on December 9, 2005 (70 FR 73250) and received no comments (71 FR 8588)., 862290=We are proposing to obtain seven major expenditures or cost categories for the FY 2010 IPPS market basket from the Medicare cost reports\u2014the same as in the FY 2006-based hospital market basket: wages and salaries, employee benefits, contract labor, pharmaceuticals, professional liability insurance (malpractice), blood and blood products, and a residual \u201call other.\u201d The proposed cost weights that were obtained directly from the Medicare cost reports are reported in Table IV01. We are proposing to then supplement these Medicare cost report cost weights with information obtained from other data sources to derive the proposed IPPS market basket cost weights., 258191=5. Previously Adopted Quality Measures for the FY 2014 and FY 2015 Payment Determinations and Subsequent Payment Determinations, 691504=We note that, although we cannot disclose the cost of the technology, the device is very costly. Because of its high costs, the technology would easily exceed the case-weighted threshold. In addition, because of the high cost of the device it is likely that claims with the device would receive an outlier payment. The applicant anticipates that approximately 65 Argus\u00ae II Systems will be sold in FY 2014, of which approximately 50 systems would be provided to Medicare patients. The target disease population is extremely limited as required and supported by the HDE application. Most patients for whom this technology is indicated may be eligible for Medicare based on their age or a disability that is associated with profound blindness., 745508=The applicant included two analyses that utilize the FY 2011 MedPAR file and two analyses of hospital UB-04 claims data from the EVEREST II Continued Access Study that were collected during FY 2012. Below is a summary of the applicant's four data analyses, including the methodology and the findings for each., 655608=With regard to the newness criterion, Fidaxomicin was approved by the FDA on May 27, 2011, for the treatment of CDAD in adult patients, 18 years of age and older. In the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule, we established that the beginning of the newness period for this technology is its FDA approval date of May 27, 2011., 221344=6. Recoupment or Repayment Adjustment Authorized by Section 631 of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA)., 968033=Sections 3125 and 10314 of the Affordable Care Act provided for a temporary change in the low-volume hospital payment policy for FYs 2011 and 2012 by expanding the definition of a low-volume hospital and modifying the methodology for determining the payment adjustment for hospitals meeting the definition. Therefore, prior to the enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA) (Pub. L. 112-240) on January 2, 2013, beginning with FY 2013, the low-volume hospital qualifying criteria and payment adjustment requirements would have reverted to the statutory requirements under section 1886(d)(12) of the Act that were in effect prior to FY 2011. Section 605 of the ATRA extended for an additional year, through FY 2013, the temporary changes in the low-volume hospital definition and methodology for determining the payment adjustment made by the Affordable Care Act for FYs 2011 and 2012. Beginning with FY 2014, the low-volume hospital qualifying criteria and payment adjustment will revert to the statutory requirements that were in effect prior to the amendments made by the Affordable Care Act and the ATRA. In section V.D.3. of this preamble, we discuss the proposed low-volume hospital payment adjustment policies for FY 2014., 551569=We encourage commenters to address suggestions on coding issues involving diagnosis codes to: Donna Pickett, Co-Chairperson, ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee, NCHS, Room 2402, 3311 Toledo Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782. Comments may be sent by Email to: dfp4@cdc.gov., 330378=The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA) (Pub. L. 112-240), enacted on January 2, 2013, also made a number of changes that affect the IPPS. We announced changes related to certain IPPS provisions for FY 2013 pursuant to sections 605 and 606 of Public Law 112-240 in a notice issued in the Federal Register on March 7, 2013 (78 FR 14689)., 617709=Since FY 2009, the relative weights have been based on 100 percent cost weights based on our MS-DRG grouping system., 649658=BTG International, Inc. submitted an application for new technology add-on payments for Glucarpidase (trade brand Voraxaze\u00ae) for FY 2013. Glucarpidase is used in the treatment of patients who have been diagnosed with toxic methotrexate (MTX) concentrations as of result of renal impairment. The administration of Glucarpidase causes a rapid and sustained reduction of toxic MTX concentrations., 977900=Prior to the enactment of the ATRA, in the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 53406 through 53409), we discussed the low-volume hospital payment adjustment for FY 2013 and subsequent fiscal years. Specifically, we discussed that in accordance with section 1886(d)(12) of the Act, beginning with FY 2013, the low-volume hospital definition and payment adjustment methodology would revert back to the statutory requirements that were in effect prior to the amendments made by the Affordable Care Act. Therefore, we explained, as specified under the existing regulations at \u00a7 412.101, effective for FY 2013 and subsequent years, that in order to qualify as a low-volume hospital, a subsection (d) hospital must be more than 25 road miles from another subsection (d) hospital and have less than 200 discharges (that is, less than 200 total discharges, including both Medicare and non-Medicare discharges) during the fiscal year. We also established a procedure for hospitals to request low-volume hospital status for FY 2013 (which was consistent with our previously established procedures for FYs 2011 and 2012)., 268680=B. Proposed Adjustment for Area Wage Levels Under the LTCH PPS for FY 2014, 234067=1. IME Adjustment Factor for FY 2014, 375943=It is often our practice to phase in rate adjustments over more than one year in order to moderate the effect on rates in any one year. Therefore, consistent with the policies that we have adopted in many similar cases, in the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule, we made an adjustment to the standardized amount of \u22122.9 percent, representing approximately half of the aggregate adjustment required under section 7(b)(1)(B) of Public Law 110-90, for FY 2011. An adjustment of this magnitude allowed us to moderate the effects on hospitals in one year while simultaneously making it possible to implement the entire adjustment within the timeframe required under section 7(b)(1)(B) of Public Law 110-90 (that is, no later than FY 2012). For FY 2012, in accordance with the timeframes set forth by section 7(b)(1)(B) of Public Law 110-90, and consistent with the discussion in the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule, we completed the recoupment adjustment by implementing the remaining \u22122.9 percent adjustment, in addition to removing the effect of the \u22122.9 percent adjustment to the standardized amount finalized for FY 2011 (76 FR 51489 and 51498). Because these adjustments, in effect, balanced out, there was no year-to-year change in the standardized amount due to this recoupment adjustment for FY 2012. In the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 53276), we made a final +2.9 percent adjustment to the standardized amount, completing the recoupment portion of section 7(b)(1)(B) of Public Law 110-90. We note that with this positive adjustment, according to our estimates, all overpayments made in FY 2008 and FY 2009 have been fully recaptured with appropriate interest, and the standardized amount has been returned to the appropriate baseline., 659966=With respect to newness, the applicant stated that FDA approval for the use of the Zenith\u00ae F. Graft was granted on April 4, 2012. In the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 53360 through 53365), we stated that because the Zenith\u00ae F. Graft was approved by the FDA on April 4, 2012, we believed that the Zenith\u00ae F. Graft met the newness criterion as of that date., 631202=Section 503(d)(2) of Public Law 108-173 provides that there shall be no reduction or adjustment in aggregate payments under the IPPS due to add-on payments for new medical services and technologies. Therefore, in accordance with section 503(d)(2) of Public Law 108-173, add-on payments for new medical services or technologies for FY 2005 and later years have not been subjected to budget neutrality., 641998=A number of attendees at the new technology town hall meeting provided comments that were unrelated to \u201csubstantial clinical improvement.\u201d As explained above and in the Federal Register notice announcing the new technology town hall meeting (77 FR 70163 through 70165), the purpose of the new technology town hall meeting was specifically to discuss the substantial clinical improvement criterion in regard to pending new technology applications for FY 2014. Therefore, we are not summarizing those comments in this proposed rule. Commenters are welcome to resubmit these comments in response to proposals presented in this proposed rule., 256268=b. Proposed New Measures Beginning with the FY 2016 PQHQR Program, 757549=Using the FY 2014 Table 10 thresholds, the case-weighted threshold for MS-DRGs 250 and 251 was $61,805 (all calculations above were performed using unrounded numbers). Because the inflated case-weighted average standardized charge per case for the applicable MS-DRGs for both charge inflation approaches exceeds the case-weighted threshold amount, the applicant maintained that the MitraClip\u00ae System would meet the cost criterion., 681584=Second Sight Medical Products, Inc. submitted an application for new technology add-on payments for the Argus\u00ae II Retinal Prosthesis System (Argus\u00ae II System) for FY 2014. The Argus\u00ae II System is an active implantable medical device that is intended to provide electrical stimulation of the retina to induce visual perception in patients who are profoundly blind due to retinitis pigmentosa (RP). These patients have bare or no light perception in both eyes. The system employs electrical signals to bypass dead photo-receptor cells and stimulate the overlying neurons according to a real-time video signal that is wirelessly transmitted from an externally worn video camera. The Argus\u00ae II implant is intended to be implanted in a single eye, typically the worse-seeing eye. Currently, bilateral implants are not intended for this technology. According to the applicant, the surgical implant procedure takes approximately 4 hours and is performed under general anesthesia., 1008647=Section 1886(r) of the Act states that this provision is effective for \u201cfiscal year 2014 and each subsequent fiscal year.\u201d In this proposed rule, we set forth our proposals for implementing the required changes to the DSH payment methodology. We note that, because section 1886 (r) modifies the payment required under section 1886(d)(5)(F) of the Act, it affects only the DSH payment under the operating IPPS. It does not revise or replace the capital IPPS DSH payment provided under the regulations at 42 CFR Part 412, Subpart M, which were established through the exercise of the Secretary's discretion in implementing the capital IPPS under section 1886(g)(1)(A) of the Act., 704064=With respect to the newness criterion, the applicant stated that some patients with partial onset seizures that cannot be controlled with antiepileptic medications may be candidates for the vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) or for surgical removal of the seizure focus. According to the applicant, these treatments are not appropriate or helpful for all patients. Therefore, the applicant believed that there is an unmet clinical need for additional therapies for partial onset seizures. The applicant further stated that the RNS\u00ae System addresses this unmet clinical need by providing a novel treatment option for treating persons with medically intractable partial onset seizures. The applicant anticipates FDA premarket approval of the RNS\u00ae System in the second quarter of 2013., 860015=The terms \u201crebasing\u201d and \u201crevising,\u201d while often used interchangeably, actually denote different activities. \u201cRebasing\u201d means moving the base year for the structure of costs of an input price index (for example, in this proposed rule, we are proposing to shift the base year cost structure for the IPPS hospital index from FY 2006 to FY 2010). \u201cRevising\u201d means changing data sources, or price proxies, used in the input price index. As published in the FY 2006 IPPS final rule (70 FR 47387), in accordance with section 404 of Public Law 108-173, CMS determined a new frequency for rebasing the hospital market basket. We established a rebasing frequency of every 4 years and, therefore, for the FY 2014 IPPS update, we are proposing to rebase and revise the IPPS market basket. We are inviting public comments on our proposed methodology discussed below., 947008=Based on the most recent data available for this proposed rule, in accordance with section 1886(b)(3)(B) of the Act, we are proposing to base the proposed FY 2014 market basket update used to determine the applicable percentage increase for the IPPS on the IHS Global Insight, Inc. (IGI's) first quarter 2013 forecast of the FY 2010-based IPPS market basket rate-of-increase, which is estimated to be 2.5 percent. In the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (76 FR 51689 through 51692), we finalized our methodology for calculating and applying the MFP adjustment. For FY 2014, we are not proposing any change in our methodology for calculating and applying the MFP adjustment. However, for this proposed rule, we are using the most recent data available to compute the MFP adjustment. Using the methodology that we finalized in the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (76 FR 51690), the proposed FY 2014 market basket update, subject to the hospital submitting quality data under rules established by the Secretary in accordance with section 1886(b)(3)(B)(viii) of the Act, is then reduced by the most recent estimate of the MFP adjustment (the 10-year moving average of MFP for the period ending FY 2014) of 0.4 percent. Following application of the MFP adjustment, the applicable percentage increase is then reduced by 0.3 percentage point, as required by section 1886(b)(3)(B)(xii) of the Act (as discussed in section I. of the Addendum to this proposed rule)., 849463=For FY 2014, as described in section IV. of the preamble of this proposed rule, we are proposing to rebase and revise the IPPS market basket using FY 2010 as the base year. Using the proposed FY 2010-based IPPS market basket, we also are proposing to recalculate the labor-related share for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2013. As discussed in Appendix A of this proposed rule, we are proposing this revised and rebased labor-related share in a budget neutral manner. However, consistent with section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act, we are not taking into account the additional payments that would be made as a result of hospitals with a wage index less than or equal to 1.0 being paid using a labor-related share lower than the labor-related share of hospitals with a wage index greater than 1.0., 925055=We are proposing to use the building and fixed equipment and movable equipment weights derived from FY 2010 Medicare cost reports to separate the depreciation expenses into annual amounts of building and fixed equipment depreciation and movable equipment depreciation. Year-end asset costs for building and fixed equipment and movable equipment were determined by multiplying the annual depreciation amounts by the expected life calculations from the FY 2010 Medicare cost reports. We then calculated a time series back to 1963 of annual capital purchases by subtracting the previous year asset costs from the current year asset costs. From this capital purchase time series, we were able to calculate the vintage weights for building and fixed equipment and for movable equipment. Each of these sets of vintage weights is explained in more detail below., 235019=2. Provisions of the ATRA for FY 2013, 780673=However, because the bulletin was not issued until February 28, 2013, with supporting data not available until later, and because the changes made by the bulletin and their ramifications must be extensively reviewed and verified, we were unable to undertake such a lengthy process before publication of this FY 2014 proposed rule. By the time the bulletin was issued, the FY 2014 IPPS proposed rule was in the advanced stages of development. We had already developed the FY 2014 proposed wage index based on the previous OMB definitions. We note that, in June 2003, OMB announced changes resulting from the 2000 Census, and at that time, CMS proposed and implemented the changes during the following year's rulemaking cycle for FY 2005. Although OMB published the data earlier than June this year, we still are in essentially the same situation as we were in 2003 because the data are not available in time to be incorporated into this year's rulemaking cycle. To allow for sufficient time to assess the new changes and their ramifications, we intend to propose changes to the wage index based on the newest CBSA changes in the FY 2015 proposed rule. We refer readers to the FY 2005 IPPS final rule (69 FR 49026 through 49034) for those interested in learning about the issues we may need to address next year in proposing to implement the latest OMB update for FY 2015, and some of the policy decisions that we may consider making., 552496=In the September 7, 2001 final rule implementing the IPPS new technology add-on payments (66 FR 46906), we indicated we would attempt to include proposals for procedure codes that would describe new technology discussed and approved at the Spring meeting as part of the code revisions effective the following October., 906900=Using the cost category weights from the proposed FY 2010-based IPPS market basket, we calculated a labor-related share of 69.587 percent, approximately 0.8 percentage point higher than the current labor-related share of 68.802., 253673=f. Proposed HCAHPS Requirements for the FY 2017 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years, 662987=We received five applications for new technology add-on payments for FY 2014., 430276=As we stated in the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (76 FR 51506 and 51507), in preparation for the transition to the ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS code sets, further information regarding the use of the POA indicator with the ICD-10-CM/ICD-10-PCS classifications as they pertain to the HAC policy will be discussed in future rulemaking., 710687=Using this approach, the applicant added the anticipated hospital charge for the implantable RNS\u00ae System to the inflated average standardized charge per case and determined a final inflated average standardized charge per case of $121,990. Although the applicant submitted data related to the estimated cost of the RNS\u00ae System, the applicant noted that the cost of the technology was proprietary information. Using the FY 2014 Table 10 thresholds, the threshold for MS-DRG 024 is $78,039. Because the final inflated average standardized charge per case of $121,990 for MS-DRG 024 exceeds the threshold amount, the applicant maintained that the RNS\u00ae System would meet the cost criterion., 775932=As discussed below in section III.H. of this preamble, we also take into account the geographic reclassification of hospitals in accordance with sections 1886(d)(8)(B) and 1886(d)(10) of the Act when calculating IPPS payment amounts. Under section 1886(d)(8)(D) of the Act, the Secretary is required to adjust the standardized amounts so as to ensure that aggregate payments under the IPPS after implementation of the provisions of sections 1886(d)(8)(B) and (C) and 1886(d)(10) of the Act are equal to the aggregate prospective payments that would have been made absent these provisions. The proposed budget neutrality adjustment for FY 2014 is discussed in section II.A.4.b. of the Addendum to this proposed rule., 54376=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 1, 2015, 917605=For the FY 2010-based CIPI, we are proposing to derive the split using the relative FY 2010 Medicare cost report data on interest expenses for government/nonprofit and for-profit hospitals. Based on these data, we calculated an 89/11 split between government/nonprofit and for-profit interest. We believe it is important that this split reflects the latest relative cost structure of interest expenses., 706047=The applicant submitted two analyses to demonstrate that it meets the cost criterion. For the first analysis, the applicant used clinical trial claims data collected in the RNS\u00ae System Pivotal Clinical Investigation to calculate the anticipated average standardized charge. The applicant maintained that this analysis best represents the anticipated charges for the technology because it is based on actual cases treated with this technology. The applicant analyzed 163 claims from 28 hospitals participating in the clinical trial. Five claims from one site were excluded because no hospital-specific information regarding standardization was available. The resulting 158 claims included dates of service ranging from May 2006 through May 2009. The average charge per case for these 158 claims was $54,961., 290534=We are proposing a number of changes in policies to implement section 1886(q) of the Act, as added by section 3025 of the Affordable Care Act, which establishes the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program. The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program requires a reduction to a hospital's base operating DRG payment to account for excess readmissions of selected applicable conditions. These conditions are acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia. For FY 2014, we are proposing additional exclusions to the three existing readmission measures (that is, the excess readmission ratio) that account for planned readmissions. We also are proposing additional readmission measures to be used in the payment determination for FY 2015. In addition, we are proposing that the readmissions payment adjustment factors for FY 2014 can be no more than a 2-percent reduction (there is a 1-percent cap in FY 2013), consistent with the statute. We are proposing a change in the methodology we use to calculate the readmissions payment adjustment factors to make it more consistent with the calculation of the excess readmission ratio., 262355=5. Proposed Quality Measures for the FY 2015 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years, 861263=The major source of expenditure data for developing the rebased and revised hospital market basket cost weights is the FY 2010 Medicare cost reports. These FY 2010 Medicare cost reports are for cost reporting periods beginning on and after October 1, 2009 and before October 1, 2010. We are proposing to use FY 2010 as the base year because we believe that the FY 2010 Medicare cost reports represent the most recent, complete set of Medicare cost report data available for IPPS hospitals. As was done in previous rebasings, these cost reports are from IPPS hospitals only (hospitals excluded from the IPPS and CAHs are not included) and are based on IPPS Medicare-allowable operating costs. IPPS Medicare-allowable operating costs are costs that are eligible to be paid for under the IPPS. For example, the IPPS market basket excludes home health agency (HHA) costs as these costs would be paid under the HHA PPS and, therefore, these costs are not IPPS Medicare-allowable costs., 418328=However, the treatment of certain conditions can generate higher Medicare payments in two ways. First, if a hospital incurs exceptionally high costs treating a patient, the hospital stay may generate an outlier payment. Because the outlier payment methodology requires that hospitals experience large losses on outlier cases before outlier payments are made, hospitals have an incentive to prevent outliers. Second, under the MS-DRG system that took effect in FY 2008 and that has been refined through rulemaking in subsequent years, certain conditions can generate higher payments even if the outlier payment requirements are not met. Under the MS-DRG system, there are currently 261 sets of MS-DRGs that are split into 2 or 3 subgroups based on the presence or absence of a CC or an MCC. The presence of a CC or an MCC generally results in a higher payment., 796227=As discussed in the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 53367 through 53368), the occupational mix adjustment to the FY 2013 wage index was based on data collected on the 2010 Medicare Wage Index Occupational Mix Survey (Form CMS-10079 (2010)). For the FY 2014 wage index, we are proposing to again use occupational mix data collected on the 2010 survey to compute the occupational mix adjustment for FY 2014. We are including data for 3,188 hospitals that also have wage data included in the proposed FY 2014 wage index., 383718=In the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule (77 FR 27890), we proposed an additional \u22120.8 percent prospective adjustment to the standardized amount to account for this effect. We indicated that this additional prospective adjustment of \u22120.8 percent, when combined with the other prospective MS-DRG documentation and coding adjustments already made or proposed would eliminate the future effect of MS-DRG documentation and coding that did not reflect real changes in case-mix for discharges occurring through FY 2010. As discussed in the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 53278 through 53280), numerous commenters objected to the CMS proposal to make an adjustment to account for payment increases due to MS-DRG documentation and coding that did not reflect real changes in case-mix for discharges occurring through FY 2010. Many commenters continued to assert that our estimates of documentation and coding were overstated, and could be explained by other factors. These commenters also focused on part of the analysis provided by MedPAC in its FY 2012 public comment letter indicating that a slightly smaller additional prospective adjusment of \u22120.55 percent rather than \u22120.8 percent might be required to offset the cumulative MS-DRG documentation and coding effect through FY 2010. Specifically, while MedPAC supported the overall methodology, it suggested that it was possible that changes in documentation and coding to optimize payments under the MS-DRG GROUPERs and weights may have resulted in slightly less than optimal payments under the FY 2007 GROUPER and weights (the denominator of the documentation and coding change estimate). Many commenters requested that, given the MedPAC analysis, if CMS were to apply an additional prospective adjustment to the MS-DRG documentation and coding effect through FY 2010, it should subtract 0.25 percentage points from its estimate, for an adjustment of \u22120.55 percent., 832038=The preliminary, unaudited Worksheet S-3 wage data and occupational mix survey data files for the proposed FY 2014 wage index were made available on October 3, 2012, through the Internet on the CMS Web site at: http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/Wage-Index-Files-Items/FY_2014_Wage_Index_Home_Page.html., 915461=Both sets of weights are developed using the best data sources available. In reviewing source data, we determined that the Medicare cost reports provided accurate data for all capital expenditure cost categories. We used the FY 2010 Medicare cost reports for IPPS hospitals to determine weights for all three cost categories: depreciation, interest, and other capital expenses., 237131=2. Overview of the FY 2013 Hospital VBP Program, 643767=The AutoLITT TM received a 510(k) FDA clearance in May 2009. The AutoLITT TM is indicated for use to necrotize or coagulate soft tissue through interstitial irradiation or thermal therapy in medicine and surgery in the discipline of neurosurgery with 1064 nm lasers. The AutoLITT TM may be used in patients with glioblastoma multiforme brain tumors. The applicant stated in its application and through supplemental information that, due to required updates, the technology was actually introduced to the market in December 2009. After evaluation of the newness, costs, and substantial clinical improvement criteria for new technology add-on payments for the AutoLITT TM and consideration of the public comments we received in response to the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule, including the additional analysis of clinical data and supporting information submitted by the applicant, we approved the AutoLITT TM for new technology add-on payments for FY 2011. In the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule (77 FR 27935 through 27936), based on the original information provided by the applicant, we believed that the newness date for the AutoLITT TM began in December 2009. However, as summarized in the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 53345 through 53346), the applicant submitted a public comment (in response to the FY 2013 proposed rule) demonstrating that the AutoLITT TM was first available on May 11, 2010. The manufacturer explained that some of the sterile disposable products were not released from quarantine until May 11, 2010, which prevented the AutoLITT TM from being used prior to May 11, 2010. Therefore, the manufacturer asserted that the first time the AutoLITT TM was available on the market was May 11, 2010. As a result of this information, we continued to make new technology add-on payments for the AutoLITT TM in FY 2013. (We refer readers to the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule for a complete discussion on this issue)., 238982=c.

Proposed Labor-Related Share for the Proposed FY 2014 Wage Index, 201600=COBRAConsolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1985, 99, 922916=To calculate the vintage weights for depreciation and interest expenses, we needed a time series of capital purchases for building and fixed equipment and movable equipment. We found no single source that provides a uniquely best time series of capital purchases by hospitals for all of the above components of capital purchases. The early Medicare cost reports did not have sufficient capital data to meet this need. Data we obtained from the American Hospital Association (AHA) do not include annual capital purchases. However, AHA does provide a consistent database back to 1963. We used data from the AHA Panel Survey and the AHA Annual Survey to obtain a time series of total expenses for hospitals. We then used data from the AHA Panel Survey supplemented with the ratio of depreciation to total hospital expenses obtained from the Medicare cost reports to derive a trend of annual depreciation expenses for 1963 through 2010., 826509=As in the past, hospitals redesignated under section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act are also eligible to be reclassified to a different area by the MGCRB. Using Table 4C associated with this proposed rule (which is available via the Internet on the CMS Web site), affected hospitals may compare the reclassified wage index for the labor market area into which they would be reclassified by the MGCRB to the reclassified wage index for the area to which they are redesignated under section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act. Hospitals may withdraw from an MGCRB reclassification within 45 days of the publication of this FY 2014 proposed rule. (We refer readers to the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (76 FR 51598 through 51599) for the procedural rules and requirements for a hospital that is redesignated under section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act and seeking reclassification under the MGCRB, as well as our policy of measuring the urban area, exclusive of the Lugar County, for purposes of meeting proximity requirements.) We treat New England deemed counties in a manner consistent with how we treat Lugar counties. (We refer readers to the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment period (72 FR 47337 through 47338) for a discussion of this policy.), 756646=The applicant then added commercial charges for the device to the inflated standardized charges (for both charge inflation approaches). As mentioned above, although the applicant submitted data that related to the estimated cost of the MitraClip\u00ae System, the applicant noted that the cost of the technology was proprietary information. To compute the commercial charges for the MitraClip\u00ae System, the applicant used the anticipated U.S. commercial price of the MitraClip\u00ae System and divided the amount by the \u201cSupplies and Equipment\u201d cost center CCR (in the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule) of 0.335. This resulted in an inflated case-weighted average standardized charge per case of $136,183 and $139,535 under the first and second charge inflation approaches, respectively., 870023=The \u201call other\u201d cost category expenditure shares are determined as being equal to each category's proportion to total \u201call other\u201d expenditures based on the aged 2002 Benchmark I-O data. For instance, if the cost for telephone services represented 10 percent of the sum of the \u201call other\u201d Benchmark I-O hospital expenditures, telephone services would represent 10 percent of the \u201call other\u201d cost category of the proposed IPPS market basket., 519621=The following chart shows the analysis of the MedPAR claims data for FY 2012 for ICD-9-CM diagnosis code 414.4., 814664=Section 10324 of Public Law 111-148 requires that hospitals in frontier States cannot be assigned a wage index of less than 1.0000 (we refer readers to regulations at 42 CFR 412.64(m) and to a discussion of the implementation of this provision in the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (75 FR 50160 through 50161). Forty-six hospitals would receive the frontier floor value of 1.0000 for their proposed FY 2014 wage index in this proposed rule. These hospitals are located in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. Although Nevada is also defined as a frontier State, its proposed FY 2014 rural floor value of 1.1503 is greater than 1.0000, and therefore no Nevada hospitals would receive a frontier floor value for their proposed FY 2014 wage index., 212261=OBRA 86Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, 99, 238041=b. Proposed Clinical Process of Care Domain Performance Period and Baseline Periods for the FY 2016 Hospital VBP Program, 405017=In order to model the effects on the relative weights in medical MS-DRGs versus surgical MS-DRGs, we compared a set of relative weights calculated with 15 CCRs and 19 CCRs. Overall, if 19 CCRs are used to calculate the relative weights for FY 2014, relative weights for medical MS-DRGs would be expected to decrease by approximately 1.1 percent, and those for surgical MS-DRGs would be expected to increase by approximately 1.2 percent. In addition, as shown in the table below, at the MDC level, payments would increase by approximately 0.64 percent (0.39 + 0.25) within orthopedic and cardiac MDCs, with most of the reductions in payment resulting to the medical MS-DRGs in the nervous system, digestive system, and respiratory system MDCs., 259155=8. Proposed New LTCHQR Program Quality Measures Affecting the FY 2017 and FY 2018 Payment Determinations and Subsequent Payment Determinations, 368199=In the FY 2010 IPPS/RY 2010 LTCH PPS final rule (74 FR 43767 through 43777), we opted to delay the implementation of any documentation and coding adjustment until a full analysis of case-mix changes based on FY 2009 claims data could be completed. We refer readers to the FY 2010 IPPS/RY LTCH PPS final rule for a detailed description of our proposal, responses to comments, and finalized policy. After analysis of the FY 2009 claims data for the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (75 FR 50057 through 50073), we found a total prospective documentation and coding effect of 1.054 percent. After accounting for the \u22120.6 percent and the \u22120.9 percent documentation and coding adjustments in FYs 2008 and 2009, we found a remaining documentation and coding effect of 3.9 percent. As we have discussed, an additional cumulative adjustment of \u22123.9 percent would be necessary to meet the requirements of section 7(b)(1)(A) of Public Law 110-90 to make an adjustment to the average standardized amounts in order to eliminate the full effect of the documentation and coding changes that do not reflect real changes in case-mix on future payments. Unlike section 7(b)(1)(B) of Public Law 110-90, section 7(b)(1)(A) does not specify when we must apply the prospective adjustment, but merely requires us to make an \u201cappropriate\u201d adjustment. Therefore, as we stated in the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (75 FR 50061), we believe the law provided some discretion as to the manner in which we applied the prospective adjustment of \u22123.9 percent. As we discussed extensively in the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule, it has been our practice to moderate payment adjustments when necessary to mitigate the effects of significant downward adjustments on hospitals, to avoid what could be widespread, disruptive effects of such adjustments on hospitals. Therefore, we stated that we believed it was appropriate to not implement the \u22123.9 percent prospective adjustment in FY 2011 because we finalized a \u22122.9 percent recoupment adjustment for that year. Accordingly, we did not propose a prospective adjustment under section 7(b)(1)(A) of Public Law 110-90 for FY 2011 (75 FR 23868 through 23870). We note that, as a result, payments in FY 2011 (and in each future year until we implemented the requisite adjustment) would be higher than they would have been if we had implemented an adjustment under section 7(b)(1)(A) of Public Law 110-90., 246606=b. Development of the Proposed MS-LTC-DRG Relative Weights for FY 2014, 264209=11. Waivers from Quality Reporting Requirements for the FY 2014 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years, 415066=As we have stated in prior rulemaking (77 FR 53281 through 53283), once we determined that cost report data were available for analysis, we would propose, if appropriate, to use the distinct CCRs described above in the calculation of the MS-DRG relative weights. We believe that the analytic findings described above using the FY 2011 cost report data and FY 2012 claims data support our original decision to break out and create new cost centers for implantable devices, MRIs, CT scans, and cardiac catheterization, and we see no reason to further delay proposing to implement the CCRs of each of these cost centers. Therefore, beginning in FY 2014, we are proposing to calculate the MS-DRG relative weights using 19 CCRs, creating distinct CCRs from cost report data for implantable devices, MRIs, CT scans, and cardiac catheterization. We welcome public comments on this proposal and the impacts that it may have. We refer readers to section VI.C. of Appendix A of this proposed rule for the overall IPPS operating impact of this proposal, which models payments to various hospital types using relative weights developed from 19 CCRs as compared to 15 CCRs. In addition, each year, as part of the IPPS proposed rule and final rule, we issue Table 5, which lists all of the MS-DRGs and their relative weights. As part of this FY 2014 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule, in addition to providing Table 5, which lists the proposed MS-DRGs and their relative weights using 19 CCRs (available on the CMS Web site at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/AcuteInpatientPPS/01_overview.asp; click on the link on the left side of the screen titled \u201cFY 2014 IPPS Proposed Rule Home Page\u201d or \u201cAcute Inpatient\u2014Files for Download\u201d), we are providing a separate table that lists all MS-DRGs and their relative weights if computed using 15 CCRs (available at the same CMS Web site cited above). These two formats will allow readers to compare our proposal to calculate the MS-DRG relative weights using 19 CCRs with the relative weights of MS-DRGs if computed using 15 CCRs., 268579=A. Proposed LTCH PPS Standard Federal Rate for FY 2014, 914614=For the FY 2014 IPPS update, we are proposing to rebase and revise the CIPI to a FY 2010 base year to reflect the more current structure of capital costs in hospitals. As with the FY 2006-based index, we developed two sets of weights in order to calculate the proposed FY 2010-based CIPI. The first set of weights identifies the proportion of hospital capital expenditures attributable to each expenditure category, while the second set of weights is a set of relative vintage weights for depreciation and interest. The set of vintage weights is used to identify the proportion of capital expenditures within a cost category that is attributable to each year over the useful life of the capital assets in that category. A more thorough discussion of vintage weights is provided later in this section., 302202=While our actuaries estimate that a \u22129.3 percent recoupment adjustment to the standardized amount would be necessary if CMS were to fully recover the $11 billion recoupment required by section 631 of the ATRA in FY 2014, it is often our practice to delay or phase in rate adjustments over more than one year, in order to moderate the effects on rates in any one year. Therefore, consistent with the policies that we have adopted in many similar cases, we are proposing a \u22120.8 percent recoupment adjustment to the standardized amount in FY 2014. We estimate that this level of adjustment would recover $0.96 billion in FY 2014, with approximately $10.4 billion remaining to be addressed. We are not proposing any future adjustments at this time but note that if recoupment adjustments of approximately \u22120.8 percent are implemented in FYs 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, we estimate that the entire $11 billion will be recovered by the end of the statutory 4-year timeline., 305075=In addition, we are proposing to update the labor-related share under the IPPS for FY 2014 based on the proposed FY 2010-based IPPS market basket, which would result in a labor-related share of 69.6 percent (compared to the FY 2013 labor-related share of 68.8) or 62 percent, depending on which results in higher payments to the hospital. For FY 2014, the proposed labor-related share for the Puerto Rico-specific standardized amount would be either 63.2 percent or 62 percent, depending on which results in higher payments to the hospital. We are projecting that there would be no impact on aggregate IPPS payments as a result of this proposal due to the statutory requirement that any changes to the IPPS area wage adjustment (including the labor-related share) are adopted in a budget neutral manner., 293827=In response to a comment we received on the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule and consistent with the inpatient day counting rules for DSH as clarified in the FY 2010 IPPS/RY 2010 LTCH PPS final rule, we are proposing that patient days associated with maternity patients who were admitted as inpatients and were receiving ancillary labor and delivery services at the time the inpatient routine census is taken, regardless of whether the patient actually occupied a routine bed prior to occupying an ancillary labor and delivery bed and regardless of whether the patient occupies a \u201cmaternity suite\u201d in which labor, delivery recovery, and postpartum care all take place in the same room, would be included in the Medicare utilization calculation. We understand that including labor and delivery inpatient days in the Medicare utilization calculation invariably would reduce direct GME payments because direct GME payments are based, in part, on a hospital's Medicare utilization ratio and the denominator of that ratio, which includes the hospital's total inpatient days, would increase at a higher rate than the numerator of the ratio, which includes the hospital's Medicare inpatient days. However, because the Medicare utilization ratio is a comparison of a hospital's total Medicare inpatient days to its total inpatient days, we believe that revising the ratio to include labor and delivery days is appropriate because they are inpatient days and therefore should be counted as such. We are proposing to include labor and delivery days as inpatient days in the Medicare utilization calculation effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2013., 967088=We reiterate that, if an osteopathic hospital is to qualify for RRC status for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2013, the hospital would be required to have at least 3,000 discharges for its cost reporting period that began during FY 2011 (based on a combination of FY 2010 and FY 2011 cost report data as explained earlier in this section)., 190299=James Poyer, (410) 786-2261, Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting and Hospital Value-Based Purchasing\u2014Program Administration, Validation, and Reconsideration Issues., 463803=Given the limited number of cases for this procedure and the advice from our clinical advisors, we are not proposing any MS-DRG changes for bronchial valve(s) insertion for FY 2014. We also are not proposing to change the MS-DRG assignment for procedures involving bronchial valve(s) insertion (procedure codes 33.71 and 33.73) within MS-DRGs 190, 191, and 192., 504002=We are inviting public comments on our proposal to remove diagnosis codes 751.1, 751.2, and 751.61 from the pediatric age conflict edit effective October 1, 2013., 888801=We are proposing to use a blended PPI composed of the PPI for Industrial Gas Manufacturing (NAICS 325120) (BLS series code PCU325120325120P), the PPI for Other Basic Inorganic Chemical Manufacturing (NAICS 325180) (BLS series code PCU32518-32518-), the PPI for Other Basic Organic Chemical Manufacturing (NAICS 325190) (BLS series code PCU32519-32519), and the PPI for Soap and Cleaning Compound Manufacturing (NAICS 325610) (BLS series code PCU32561-32561-)., 337024=In this proposed rule, we are proposing to implement or to make conforming changes to regulation text in accordance with the following provisions (or portions of the following provisions) of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 that are applicable to the IPPS:, 453595=In response to the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule, we received a request to modify the MS-DRG assignment for bronchial valve(s) insertion, which we considered to be outside of the scope of that proposed rule (77 FR 53325 through 53326). The requestor asked that cases in MS-DRGs 190, 191, and 192 (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease with MCC, with CC, and without MCC/CC, respectively) that involve insertion of a bronchial valve be assigned instead to MS-DRGs 163, 164, and 165 (Major Chest Procedures with MCC, with CC, and without MCC/CC, respectively). The procedures are captured by procedure codes 33.71 (Endoscopic insertion or replacement of bronchial valve(s), single lobe) and 33.73 (Endoscopic insertion or replacement of bronchial valve(s), multiple lobes), which are considered nonoperating procedures and do not affect the MS-DRG assignment. When reported without any other operating room (OR) procedure code, the admission would be assigned to a medical MS-DRG., 841774=Again, we believe the wage index data correction process described above provides hospitals with sufficient opportunity to bring errors in their wage and occupational mix data to the fiscal intermediary's (or, if applicable, the MAC's) attention. Moreover, because hospitals have access to the final wage index data by early May 2013, they have the opportunity to detect any data entry or tabulation errors made by the fiscal intermediary or the MAC or CMS before the development and publication of the final FY 2014 wage index by August 2013, and the implementation of the FY 2014 wage index on October 1, 2013. If hospitals avail themselves of the opportunities afforded to provide and make corrections to the wage and occupational mix data, the wage index implemented on October 1 should be accurate. Nevertheless, in the event that errors are identified by hospitals and brought to our attention after June 3, 2013, we retain the right to make midyear changes to the wage index under very limited circumstances., 754527=The applicant then added commercial charges for the device to the inflated standardized charges (for both charge inflation approaches). Although the applicant submitted data that related to the estimated cost of the MitraClip\u00ae System, the applicant noted that the cost of the technology was proprietary information. To compute the commercial charges for the MitraClip\u00ae System, the applicant took the European commercial price of the MitraClip\u00ae System, converted the cost to U.S. dollars by multiplying the amount by an exchange rate of 1.38, and then divided the result by the \u201cSupplies and Equipment\u201d cost center CCR (in the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule) of 0.335. This resulted in an inflated case-weighted average standardized charge per case of $129,019 and $132,372 under the first and second charge inflation approaches, respectively., 391364=In the FY 2009 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (73 FR 48458 through 48467), in response to the RTI's recommendations concerning cost report refinements, we discussed our decision to pursue changes to the cost report to split the cost center for Medical Supplies Charged to Patients into one line for \u201cMedical Supplies Charged to Patients\u201d and another line for \u201cImplantable Devices Charged to Patients.\u201d We acknowledged, as RTI had found, that charge compression occurs in several cost centers that exist on the Medicare cost report. However, as we stated in the FY 2009 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule, we focused on the CCR for Medical Supplies and Equipment because RTI found that the largest impact on the MS-DRG relative weights could result from correcting charge compression for devices and implants. In determining the items that should be reported in these respective cost centers, we adopted the commenters' recommendations that hospitals should use revenue codes established by the AHA's National Uniform Billing Committee to determine the items that should be reported in the \u201cMedical Supplies Charged to Patients\u201d and the \u201cImplantable Devices Charged to Patients\u201d cost centers. Accordingly, a new subscripted line for \u201cImplantable Devices Charged to Patients\u201d was created in July 2009. This new subscripted cost center has been available for use for cost reporting periods beginning on or after May 1, 2009., 550602=Copies of the minutes of the procedure codes discussions at the Committee's September 19, 2012 meeting and March 5, 2013 meeting can be obtained from the CMS Web site at: http://cms.hhs.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD9ProviderDiagnosticCodes/index.html?redirect=/icd9ProviderDiagnosticCodes/03_meetings.asp.

We also are setting forth proposed changes relating to payments for IME costs and payments to certain hospitals that continue to be excluded from the IPPS and paid on a reasonable cost basis. In addition, in this proposed rule, we are setting forth proposed changes to the payment rates, factors, and other payment rate policies under the LTCH PPS for FY 2014., 350061=In the Addendum to this proposed rule, we set forth proposed changes to the amounts and factors for determining the proposed FY 2014 prospective payment rates for operating costs and capital-related costs for acute care hospitals. We are proposing to establish the threshold amounts for outlier cases. In addition, we address the proposed update factors for determining the rate-of-increase limits for cost reporting periods beginning in FY 2014 for certain hospitals excluded from the IPPS., 1005504=The second factor is, for FYs 2014 through 2017, 1 minus the percent change in the percent of individuals under the age of 65 who are uninsured, determined by comparing the percent of such individuals who are uninsured in 2013, the last year before coverage expansion under the Affordable Care Act (as calculated by the Secretary based on the most recent estimates available from the Director of the Congressional Budget Office before a vote in either House on the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 that, if determined in the affirmative, would clear such Act for enrollment), minus 0.1 percentage point for FY 2014, and minus 0.2 percentage point for FYs 2015 through 2017. For FYs 2014 through 2017, the baseline for the estimate of the change in uninsurance is fixed by the most recent estimate of the Congressional Budget Office before the final vote on the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which is contained in a March 20, 2010 letter from the then Director of the Congressional Budget Office to the Speaker of the House. A link to this letter is included in section V.E.3.d.2. of the preamble of this proposed rule., 842836=Specifically, in accordance with 42 CFR 412.64(k)(1) of our existing regulations, we make midyear corrections to the wage index for an area only if a hospital can show that: (1) The fiscal intermediary or the MAC or CMS made an error in tabulating its data; and (2) the requesting hospital could not have known about the error or did not have an opportunity to correct the error, before the beginning of the fiscal year. For purposes of this provision, \u201cbefore the beginning of the fiscal year\u201d means by the June 3 deadline for making corrections to the wage data for the following fiscal year's wage index. This provision is not available to a hospital seeking to revise another hospital's data that may be affecting the requesting hospital's wage index for the labor market area. As indicated earlier, because CMS makes the wage index data available to hospitals on the CMS Web site prior to publishing both the proposed and final IPPS rules, and the fiscal intermediaries or the MACs notify hospitals directly of any wage index data changes after completing their desk reviews, we do not expect that midyear corrections will be necessary. However, under our current policy, if the correction of a data error changes the wage index value for an area, the revised wage index value will be effective prospectively from the date the correction is made., 950554=Section 1886(b)(3)(B)(iv) of the Act provides that the applicable percentage increase to the hospital-specific rates for SCHs equals the applicable percentage increase set forth in section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i) of the Act (that is, the same update factor as for all other hospitals subject to the IPPS). Therefore, the update to the hospital-specific rates for SCHs is also subject to section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i) of the Act, as amended by sections 3401(a) and 10319(a) of the Affordable Care Act. Accordingly, we are proposing an update to the hospital-specific rates applicable to SCHs of 1.8 percent for hospitals that submit quality data or \u22120.2 percent for hospitals that fail to submit quality data. For FY 2014, the existing regulations in \u00a7\u00a7 412.73(c)(16), 412.75(d), 412.77(e) and 412.78(e) contain provisions that set the update factor for SCHs equal to the update factor applied to the national standardized amount for all IPPS hospitals. Therefore, we are not proposing to make any further changes to these four regulatory provisions to reflect the FY 2014 update factor for the hospital-specific rates of SCHs., 830429=In accordance with the broad discretion granted to the Secretary under section 1886(d)(13) of the Act, as added by section 505 of Public Law 108-173, beginning with FY 2005, we established a process to make adjustments to the hospital wage index based on commuting patterns of hospital employees (the \u201cout-migration\u201d adjustment). The process, outlined in the FY 2005 IPPS final rule (69 FR 49061), provides for an increase in the wage index for hospitals located in certain counties that have a relatively high percentage of hospital employees who reside in the county but work in a different county (or counties) with a higher wage index. The proposed FY 2014 out-migration adjustment is based on the same policies, procedures, and computation that were used for the FY 2012 out-migration adjustment. (We refer readers to a full discussion of the adjustment, including rules on deeming hospitals reclassified under section 1886(d)(8) or section 1886(d)(10) of the Act to have waived the out-migration adjustment, in the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (76 FR 51601 through 51602).) Table 4J, which is available via the Internet on the CMS Web site, lists the proposed out-migration adjustments for the proposed FY 2014 wage index., 654424=In the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule (77 FR 27939 through 27941), we expressed concern that DIFICID TM may not be eligible for new technology add-on payments because eligibility is limited to new technologies associated with procedures described by ICD-9-CM codes. We further stated that drugs that are only taken orally (such as DIFICID TM) may not be eligible for consideration for new technology add-on payments because there is no procedure associated with these drugs and, therefore, no ICD-9-CM code(s). In the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 53350 through 53358), after consideration of the public comments received, we revised our policy to allow the use of National Drug Codes (NDCs) to identify oral medications that have no inpatient procedure for the purposes of new technology add-on payments. The revised policy is effective for payments for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2012. We refer readers to the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule for a complete discussion on this issue., 706904=The applicant then standardized the charges for each claim. The applicant noted that it was not necessary to remove any charges from these claims because the technology was provided at no charge in the trial. After standardizing the charges, the applicant inflated each claim using the Consumer Price Index for Inpatient Hospital Services (CPI-IP) to inflate the data to the same period. Specifically, because the publicly available FY 2011 MedPAR data do not identify the month of the discharge on inpatient claims but identify the calendar quarter, the applicant used a mid-month convention to determine the relevant monthly CPI-IP for each calendar quarter. The applicant then calculated the percentage change from the relevant quarter to the quarter of the most recently available CPI-IP, which was the August 2012 CPI-IP. Specifically, the applicant used the following assumptions:, 799591=For FY 2014, we are proposing to calculate the occupational mix adjustment factor using the same methodology that we used for the FY 2012 and FY 2013 wage indices (76 FR 51582 through 51586, and 77 FR 53367 through 53368, respectively). As a result of applying this methodology, the proposed FY 2014 occupational mix adjusted national average hourly wage is $38.2094. The proposed FY 2014 occupational mix adjusted Puerto Rico-specific average hourly wage is $16.5300., 905025=Below is a table comparing the proposed FY 2010-based labor-related share and the FY 2006-based labor-related share. As discussed in section IV.B.3. of the preamble of this proposed rule, the wages and salaries and employee benefits cost weight reflect contract labor costs., 260282=b. Finalized Timeline for Data Submission under the LTCHQR Program for the FY 2016 Payment Determination, 671964=The applicant also explained that Kcentra TM undergoes a dedicated pathogen removal process and plasma does not. The applicant asserted that this drastically reduces the risk of transmitting both known and unknown blood borne pathogens. The applicant cited a retrospective analysis of scientific publications [4] on the use of Kcentra TM in the European Union (EU), including the pharmacovigilance database from 1996 through 2008. The applicant noted that an estimated 350,000 patients have been treated with Kcentra TM (known as Beriplex in the EU) with no cases of viral transmission., 299385=In section VIII.D. of the preamble of this proposed rule, we note the expiration of the moratorium on the full implementation of the \u201c25 percent threshold\u201d payment adjustment to LTCHs under the LTCH PPS for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2013., 289570=In section IV. of the preamble of this proposed rule, we are proposing to rebase and revise the acute care hospital operating and capital market baskets used to update IPPS payment rates. For both market baskets, we are proposing to update the base year cost weights from a FY 2006 base year to a FY 2010 base year. We also are proposing to recalculate the labor-related share using the proposed FY 2010-based hospital market basket, for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2013. We would use the FY 2010-based market basket in developing the FY 2014 update factor for the operating and capital prospective payment rates and the FY 2014 update factor for the excluded hospital rate-of-increase limits. We also are setting forth the data sources used to determine the proposed revised market basket relative weights., 835401=The fiscal intermediaries/MACs notified the hospitals by mid-February 2013 of any changes to the wage index data as a result of the desk reviews and the resolution of the hospitals' early-December revision requests. The fiscal intermediaries/MACs also submitted the revised data to CMS by mid-February 2013. CMS published the proposed wage index public use files that included hospitals' revised wage index data on February 21, 2013. Hospitals had until March 4, 2013, to submit requests to the fiscal intermediaries/MACs for reconsideration of adjustments made by the fiscal intermediaries/MACs as a result of the desk review, and to correct errors due to CMS' or the fiscal intermediary's (or, if applicable, the MAC's) mishandling of the wage index data. Hospitals also were required to submit sufficient documentation to support their requests., 253810=g. Proposed Data Submission Requirements for Structural Measures for the FY 2015 and FY 2016 Payment Determinations, 816714=Tables 3A and 3B, available on the CMS Web site, list the 3-year average hourly wage for each labor market area before the redesignation or reclassification of hospitals based on FYs 2008, 2009, and 2010 cost reporting periods. Table 3A lists these data for urban areas, and Table 3B lists these data for rural areas. In addition, Table 2, which is available on the CMS Web site, includes the adjusted average hourly wage for each hospital from the FY 2008 and FY 2009 cost reporting periods, as well as the FY 2010 period used to calculate the proposed FY 2014 wage index. The 3-year averages are calculated by dividing the sum of the dollars (adjusted to a common reporting period using the method described previously) across all 3 years, by the sum of the hours. If a hospital is missing data for any of the previous years, its average hourly wage for the 3-year period is calculated based on the data available during that period. The proposed average hourly wages in Tables 2, 3A, and 3B, which are available on the CMS Web site, include the proposed occupational mix adjustment. The proposed wage index values in Tables 4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D also include the proposed national rural floor budget neutrality adjustment (which includes the proposed imputed floor). The proposed wage index values in Table 2 also include the proposed out-migration adjustment for eligible hospitals., 535394=For FY 2014, we are proposing changes to Table 6G (Additions to the CC Exclusion List) and Table 6H (Deletions from the CC Exclusion List). As we discussed earlier, we are not proposing changes to the severity level for diagnosis code 414.4. These tables, which contain codes that are effective for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2013, are not being published in the Addendum to this proposed rule because of the length of the two tables. Instead, we are making them available through the Internet on the CMS Web site at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/index.html. Each of these principal diagnosis codes for which there is a CC exclusion is shown in Tables 6G and 6H with an asterisk, and the conditions that will not count as a CC are provided in an indented column immediately following the affected principal diagnosis., 574528=We provided information on a study conducted on the impact on converting MS-DRGs to ICD-10. Information on this study is summarized in a paper entitled \u201cImpact of the Transition to ICD-10 on Medicare Inpatient Hospital Payments.\u201d This paper was posted on the CMS ICD-10 MS-DRGs Conversion Project Web site and was distributed and discussed at the September 15, 2010 ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee meeting. The paper described CMS' approach to the conversion of the MS-DRGs from ICD-9-CM codes to ICD-10 codes. The study was undertaken using the ICD-9-CM MS-DRGs Version 27.0 (FY 2010) and converted to the ICD-10 MS-DRGs Version 27.0. The study estimated the impact on aggregate payment to hospitals and the distribution of payments across hospitals. The impact of the conversion from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10 on Medicare MS-DRG hospital payments was estimated using 2009 Medicare data. The study found a hospital payment increase of 0.05 percent using the ICD-10 MS-DRGs Version 27.0., 260433=c. Proposed Timeline for Data Submission for the NQF #0431 Influenza Vaccination Coverage Among Healthcare Personnel Measure for the FY 2016 Payment Determination and Subsequent Payment Determinations, 617872=When we recalibrated the DRG weights for previous years, we set a threshold of 10 cases as the minimum number of cases required to compute a reasonable weight. In this FY 2014 proposed rule, we are proposing to use that same case threshold in recalibrating the proposed MS-DRG weights for FY 2014. Using data from the FY 2012 MedPAR file, there were 7 MS-DRGs that contain fewer than 10 cases. Under the MS-DRGs, we have fewer low-volume DRGs than under the CMS DRGs because we no longer have separate DRGs for patients aged 0 to 17 years. With the exception of newborns, we previously separated some DRGs based on whether the patient was age 0 to 17 years or age 17 years and older. Other than the age split, cases grouping to these DRGs are identical. The DRGs for patients aged 0 to 17 years generally have very low volumes because children are typically ineligible for Medicare. In the past, we have found that the low volume of cases for the pediatric DRGs could lead to significant year-to-year instability in their relative weights. Although we have always encouraged non-Medicare payers to develop weights applicable to their own patient populations, we have received frequent complaints from providers about the use of the Medicare relative weights in the pediatric population. We believe that eliminating this age split in the MS-DRGs will provide more stable payment for pediatric cases by determining their payment using adult cases that are much higher in total volume. Newborns are unique and require separate MS-DRGs that are not mirrored in the adult population. Therefore, it remains necessary to retain separate MS-DRGs for newborns. All of the low-volume MS-DRGs listed below are for newborns. In FY 2014, because we do not have sufficient MedPAR data to set accurate and stable cost weights for these low-volume MS-DRGs, we are proposing to compute weights for the low-volume MS-DRGs by adjusting their FY 2013 weights by the percentage change in the average weight of the cases in other MS-DRGs. The crosswalk table is shown below:, 909211=Below is a table comparing the proposed FY 2010-based Puerto Rico-specific labor-related share and the FY 2006-based Puerto Rico-specific labor-related share., 237683=b. Proposed New Measures for the FY 2016 Hospital VBP Program, 323196=Under section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act, as amended, certain hospitals and hospital units are excluded from the IPPS. These hospitals and units are: Rehabilitation hospitals and units; long-term care hospitals (LTCHs); psychiatric hospitals and units; children's hospitals; and cancer hospitals. Religious nonmedical health care institutions (RNHCIs) are also excluded from the IPPS. Various sections of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA, Pub. L. 105-33), the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP [State Children's Health Insurance Program] Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (BBRA, Pub. L. 106-113), and the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA, Pub. L. 106-554) provide for the implementation of PPSs for rehabilitation hospitals and units (referred to as inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs)), LTCHs, and psychiatric hospitals and units (referred to as inpatient psychiatric facilities (IPFs)). (We note that the annual updates to the LTCH PPS are now included as part of the IPPS annual update document. Updates to the IRF PPS and IPF PPS are issued as separate documents.) Children's hospitals, cancer hospitals, and RNHCIs continue to be paid solely under a reasonable cost-based system subject to a rate-of-increase ceiling on inpatient operating costs., 973272=For FYs 2011 and 2012, sections 3125 and 10314 of the Affordable Care Act expanded the definition of low-volume hospital and modified the methodology for determining the payment adjustment for hospitals meeting that definition. Specifically, those provisions of the Affordable Care Act amended the qualifying criteria for low-volume hospitals under section 1886(d)(12)(C)(i) of the Act to specify that, for FYs 2011 and 2012, a subsection (d) hospital qualifies as a low-volume hospital if it is more than 15 road miles from another subsection (d) hospital and has less than 1,600 discharges of individuals entitled to, or enrolled for, benefits under Part A during the fiscal year. In addition, section 1886(d)(12)(D) of the Act, as added by the Affordable Care Act, provides that the low-volume hospital payment adjustment (that is, the percentage increase) is to be determined \u201cusing a continuous linear sliding scale ranging from 25 percent for low-volume hospitals with 200 or fewer discharges of individuals entitled to, or enrolled for, benefits under Part A in the fiscal year to zero percent for low-volume hospitals with greater than 1,600 discharges of such individuals in the fiscal year.\u201d, 215813=TEFRATax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, 97, 623272=In the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule, for FY 2013 and subsequent fiscal years, we finalized a policy to treat hospitals that participate in the BPCI initiative the same as prior fiscal years for the IPPS payment modeling and ratesetting process without regard to a hospital's participation within these bundled payment models (that is, as if a hospital were not participating in those models under the BPCI initiative). Therefore, for FY 2014, we are proposing to continue to include all applicable data from subsection (d) hospitals participating in BPCI Models 1, 2, and 4 in our IPPS payment modeling and ratesetting calculations. We refer readers to the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule for a complete discussion on our final policy for the treatment of hospitals participating in the BPCI initiative in our ratesetting process., 614739=The proposed FY 2014 cost-based relative weights were then normalized by an adjustment factor of 1.6122128377 so that the average case weight after recalibration was equal to the average case weight before recalibration. The normalization adjustment is intended to ensure that recalibration by itself neither increases nor decreases total payments under the IPPS, as required by section 1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) of the Act., 556673=In the FY 2005 IPPS final rule, we implemented section 1886(d)(5)(K)(vii) of the Act, as added by section 503(a) of Public Law 108-173, by developing a mechanism for approving, in time for the April update, diagnosis and procedure code revisions needed to describe new technologies and medical services for purposes of the new technology add-on payment process. We also established the following process for making these determinations. Topics considered during the Fall ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee meeting are considered for an April 1 update if a strong and convincing case is made by the requester at the Committee's public meeting. The request must identify the reason why a new code is needed in April for purposes of the new technology process. The participants at the meeting and those reviewing the Committee meeting summary report are provided the opportunity to comment on this expedited request. All other topics are considered for the October 1 update. Participants at the Committee meeting are encouraged to comment on all such requests. There were no requests approved for an expedited April l, 2013 implementation of an ICD-9-CM code at the September 19, 2012 Committee meeting. Therefore, there were no new ICD-9-CM codes implemented on April 1, 2013., 267314=II. Proposed Changes to the Prospective Payment Rates for Hospital Inpatient Operating Costs for Acute Care Hospitals for FY 2014, 520607=We ran the above data as described in the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment period (72 FR 47158 through 47161). The C1 value reflects a patient with no other secondary diagnosis or with all other secondary diagnoses that are non-CCs. The C2 value reflects a patient with at least one other secondary diagnosis that is a CC, but none that is an MCC. The C3 value reflects a patient with at least one other secondary diagnosis that is an MCC., 549728=For FY 2014, there were no changes to the ICD-9-CM coding system due to the partial code freeze or for new technology. Therefore, there are no new, revised, or deleted diagnosis codes and no new, revised, or deleted procedure codes that are usually announced in Tables 6A (New Diagnosis Codes), 6B (New Procedure Codes), 6C (Invalid Diagnosis Codes), 6D (Invalid Procedure Codes), 6E (Revised Diagnosis Code Titles), and 6F (Revised Procedure Codes). Therefore, there are no Tables 6A through 6F published as part of this proposed rule for FY 2014. We note that, there may be ICD-9-CM coding changes finalized after this proposed rule based on public comments that we receive after the March 5, 2013 ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee meeting. If there are changes, we will include these changes in the final rule., 343235=In section IV. of the preamble of this proposed rule, we are proposing to rebase and revise the acute care hospital operating and capital market baskets to be used in developing the FY 2014 update factor for the operating and capital prospective payment rates and the FY 2014 update factor for the excluded hospital rate-of-increase limits. We also are setting forth the data sources used to determine the proposed revised market basket relative weights., 946155=We note, in compliance with section 404 of the MMA, in this proposed rule, we are proposing to replace the FY 2006-based IPPS operating and capital market baskets with the revised and rebased FY 2010-based IPPS operating and capital market baskets for FY 2014., 399610=We believe that there is a sufficient amount of data in the FY 2011 cost reports from which to generate a meaningful analysis of using distinct CCRs for implantable devices, MRIs, CT scans, and cardiac catheterization. In addition, the corresponding charge data on hospital claims for implantable devices, MRIs, CT scans, and cardiac catheterization are available in the FY 2012 MedPAR file. Therefore, we are providing various data analyses below based on comparison of the FY 2014 relative weights computed using 15 CCRs, as we have done in the past, and the FY 2014 relative weights computed using 19 CCRs, with distinct CCRs for implantable devices, MRIs, CT scans, and cardiac catheterization. Specifically, rather than having a single CCR for \u201cSupplies and Equipment\u201d which includes low-cost supplies and high-cost implantable devices, a distinct CCR would be carved out of the \u201cSupplies and Equipment\u201d CCR, leaving one CCR for \u201cSupplies\u201d and one CCR for \u201cImplantable Devices.\u201d Regarding the Radiology CCR, which currently is comprised of general radiology ancillary services and MRIs and CT scans, the costs for MRIs and CT scans would be separated from general radiology, creating two distinct CCRs, one for MRIs and one for CT scans, respectively. Finally, by separating the costs of cardiac catheterization out of the CCR for general cardiology, a distinct CCR would be created for cardiac catheterization. Thus, by breaking out these 4 additional CCRs, the number of CCRs used to calculate the relative weights would increase from 15 to 19., 331670=In this proposed rule, we are proposing to implement, or continue in FY 2014 to implement, the following provisions (or portions of the following provisions) of the Affordable Care Act that are applicable to the IPPS, the LTCH PPS, and PPS-exempt cancer hospitals:, 386293=CMS is continuing to consider whether MedPAC's recommendation that an adjustment to offset the cumulative documentation and coding effects through FY 2010 under section 1886(d)(3)(A)(vi) of the Act is appropriate and supported by a review of the claims data. After further consideration of the MedPAC analysis and the request by many public commenters, if we were to apply an additional prospective adjustment for the cumulative MS-DRG documentation and coding effect through FY 2010, we believe the most appropriate additional adjustment is \u22120.55 percent., 786937=We asked our fiscal intermediaries/MACs to revise or verify data elements that result in specific edit failures. For the proposed FY 2014 wage index, we identified and excluded 44 providers with data that were too aberrant to include in the proposed wage index, although if data elements for some of these providers are corrected, we intend to include some of these providers in the final FY 2014 wage index. We instructed fiscal intermediaries/MACs to complete their data verification of questionable data elements and to transmit any changes to the wage data no later than April 10, 2013. We intend that all unresolved data elements will be resolved by the date the FY 2014 final rule is issued. The revised data will be reflected in the FY 2014 IPPS final rule., 589738=The 19 cost centers that we used in the proposed relative weight calculation are shown in the following table. The table shows the lines on the cost report and the corresponding revenue codes that we used to create the 19 national cost center CCRs. (We note that we have made several changes to the table, most importantly, to remove the columns listing the cost centers from the CMS Form 2552-96 cost reports. Because we are proposing to use data from FY 2011 cost reports, which were filed on the CMS Form 2552-10, the columns referencing the CMS Form 2552-96 cost report are no longer relevant. We also have updated and refined the table to reflect the proposed 19 CCRs, instead of the current 15, and we have made some minor corrections to revenue codes and cost report cost centers that are grouped with each CCR.), 872340=After computing the FY 2010 cost weights for the proposed IPPS market basket, it was necessary to select appropriate wage and price proxies to reflect the rate of price change for each expenditure category. We are proposing to use the same price proxies that were used in the FY 2006-based IPPS market basket. A discussion of our rationale for selecting these price proxies can be found in the FY 2010 IPPS/RY 2010 LTCH PPS final rule (74 FR 43845)., 726742=With regard to the cost criterion, the applicant believed that cases of superficial femoral arteries typically map to MS-DRGs 252 (Other Vascular Procedures with MCC), 253 (Other Vascular Procedures with CC), and 254 (Other Vascular Procedures without CC/MCC). The applicant searched the FY 2010 MedPAR file for cases reporting procedure code of 39.90 (Insertion of non-drug-eluting peripheral vessel stents) in combination with a diagnosis code of 440.20 (Atherosclerosis of the extremities, unspecified), 440.21 (Atherosclerosis of the extremities, with intermittent claudication), 440.22 (Atherosclerosis of the extremities with rest pain), 440.23 (Atherosclerosis of the extremities with ulceration), or 440.24 (Atherosclerosis of the extremities with gangrene). The applicant noted that the Zilver\u00ae PTX\u00ae is available in an 80 mm size and is approved for lesions in native vascular disease of the above-the-knee femoropopliteal arteries having reference vessel diameter from 4 mm to 9 mm and total lesion lengths up to 140 mm per limb. The applicant further noted that bare metal stents typically are available up to lengths of 200 mm. Therefore, in order to target cases eligible for the Zilver\u00ae PTX\u00ae, the applicant believed it was only appropriate to target those cases with one or two bare metal stents. The applicant was able to identify the amount of stents used per claim by searching for ICD-9-CM procedure codes 00.45 (Insertion of one vascular stent) and 00.46 (Insertion of two vascular stents). The applicant submitted two methodologies: one with cases that received one bare metal stent and the other with cases that received one or two bare metal stents., 844311=In the FY 2006 IPPS final rule (70 FR 47385 through 47387 and 47485), we revised 42 CFR 412.64(k)(2) to specify that, effective on October 1, 2005, that is, beginning with the FY 2006 wage index, a change to the wage index can be made retroactive to the beginning of the Federal fiscal year only when CMS determines all of the following: (1) The fiscal intermediary (or, if applicable, the MAC) or CMS made an error in tabulating data used for the wage index calculation; (2) the hospital knew about the error and requested that the fiscal intermediary (or, if applicable, the MAC) and CMS correct the error using the established process and within the established schedule for requesting corrections to the wage index data, before the beginning of the fiscal year for the applicable IPPS update (that is, by the June 3, 2013 deadline for the FY 2014 wage index); and (3) CMS agreed before October 1 that the fiscal intermediary (or, if applicable, the MAC) or CMS made an error in tabulating the hospital's wage index data and the wage index should be corrected., 236417=e. Proposed Floor Adjustment Factor for FY 2014 (\u00a7 412.154(c)(2)), 755430=Using the FY 2014 Table 10 thresholds, the case-weighted threshold for MS-DRGs 250 and 251 was $61,805 (all calculations above were performed using unrounded numbers). Because the inflated case-weighted average standardized charge per case for the applicable MS-DRGs for both charge inflation approaches exceeds the case-weighted threshold amount, the applicant maintained that the MitraClip\u00ae System would meet the cost criterion., 631977=In the FY 2009 IPPS final rule (73 FR 48561 through 48563), we modified our regulations at \u00a7 412.87 to codify our longstanding practice of how CMS evaluates the eligibility criteria for new medical service or technology add-on payment applications. That is, we first determine whether a medical service or technology meets the newness criteria, and only if so, do we then make a determination as to whether the technology meets the cost threshold and represents a substantial clinical improvement over existing medical services or technologies. We also amended \u00a7 412.87(c) to specify that all applicants for new technology add-on payments must have FDA approval or clearance for their new medical service or technology by July 1 of each year prior to the beginning of the fiscal year that the application is being considered., 941217=IHS Global Insight, Inc. forecasts a 1.2 percent increase in the FY 2010-based CIPI for FY 2014, as shown in Table IV09. The underlying vintage-weighted price increases for depreciation (including building and fixed equipment and movable equipment) and interest (including government/nonprofit and for-profit) are included in Table IV10., 228405=C. Worksheet S-3 Wage Data for the Proposed FY 2014 Wage Index, 893146=Table IV04 compares both the historical and forecasted percent changes in the FY 2006-based IPPS market basket and the proposed FY 2010-based IPPS market basket., 949948=We are proposing to revise the existing regulations at 42 CFR 412.64(d) to reflect the current law for the FY 2014 update. Specifically, in accordance with section 1886(b)(3)(B) of the Act, we are proposing to add a new paragraph (v) to \u00a7 412.64(d)(1) to reflect the applicable percentage increase to the FY 2014 operating standardized amount as the percentage increase in the market basket index less an MFP adjustment and less an additional reduction of 0.3 percentage point., 624306=Sections 1886(d)(5)(K) and (L) of the Act establish a process of identifying and ensuring adequate payment for new medical services and technologies (sometimes collectively referred to in this section as \u201cnew technologies\u201d) under the IPPS. Section 1886(d)(5)(K)(vi) of the Act specifies that a medical service or technology will be considered new if it meets criteria established by the Secretary after notice and opportunity for public comment. Section 1886(d)(5)(K)(ii)(I) of the Act specifies that a new medical service or technology may be considered for new technology add-on payment if, \u201cbased on the estimated costs incurred with respect to discharges involving such service or technology, the DRG prospective payment rate otherwise applicable to such discharges under this subsection is inadequate.\u201d We note that beginning with discharges occurring in FY 2008, CMS transitioned from CMS-DRGs to MS-DRGs., 236534=f. Proposed Applicable Period for FY 2014, 398414=To calculate the proposed FY 2014 MS-DRG relative weights, we are proposing to continue our current methodology of using the two most recent data sources: the December 2012 update of the FY 2012 MedPAR file as the claims data source and the December 2012 update of FY 2011 HCRIS as the cost data source. We currently have a substantial number of hospitals completing all, or some, of these new cost centers on the FY 2011 Medicare cost reports, compared to prior years. Specifically, using the December 2012 update of FY 2011 HCRIS, we were able to calculate a valid implantable device CCR for 2,285 IPPS hospitals, a valid MRI CCR for 1,402 IPPS hospitals, a valid CT scan CCR for 1,470 IPPS hospitals, and a valid cardiac catheterization CCR for 1,022 IPPS hospitals. In the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 53281), we stated that prior to proposing to create these CCRs, we would first thoroughly analyze and determine the impacts of the data, and that distinct CCRs for these new cost centers would be used in the calculation of the relative weights only if they were first finalized through rulemaking., 287741=Beginning in FY 2007, we implemented relative weights for DRGs based on cost report data instead of charge information. To address the issue of charge compression (the hospital practice of applying higher charges to lower cost items and applying lesser charges to higher cost items) when using cost report data to set the MS-DRG relative weights, in FYs 2009 and 2010, we created additional cost centers on the Medicare cost report to distinguish implantable devices from other medical supplies, MRIs and CT scans, respectively, from other radiology services, and cardiac catheterization from other cardiology services. As compared to previous years, we currently have a significant volume of hospitals completing all, or some, of these new cost centers on the Medicare cost report. In section II.E. of the preamble of this proposed rule, we provide various data analyses based on comparison of the FY 2014 relative weights computed using 15 cost-to-charge ratios (CCRs), as we have done in the past, and the FY 2014 relative weights computed using 19 CCRs, with distinct CCRs for implantable devices, MRIs, CT scans, and cardiac catheterization., 263507=c. Proposed Submission Requirements for the FY 2016 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years, 789834=The method used to compute the proposed FY 2014 wage index without an occupational mix adjustment follows the same methodology that we used to compute the FY 2012 final wage index without an occupational mix adjustment (76 FR 51591 through 51593) and which we discussed and used for the FY 2013 final wage index without an occupational mix adjustment (77 FR 53366 through 53367)., 275020=C. Proposed FY 2014 Puerto Rico Hospital Update, 378614=Section 631 of the ATRA amended section 7(b)(1)(B) of Public Law 110-90 to require the Secretary to make a recoupment adjustment or adjustments totaling $11 billion by FY 2017. This adjustment represents the amount of the increase in aggregate payments as a result of not completing the prospective adjustment authorized under section 7(b)(1)(A) of Public Law 110-90 until FY 2013. As discussed earlier, this delay in implementation resulted in overstated payment rates in FYs 2010, 2011, and 2012. The resulting overpayments could not have been recovered under Public Law 110-90., 220729=4. Prospective Adjustments for FY 2008 and FY 2009 Authorized by Section 7(b)(1)(A) of Public Law 110-90, 268463=V. Proposed Updates to the Payment Rates for the LTCH PPS for FY 2014, 269537=E. Computing the Proposed Adjusted LTCH PPS Federal Prospective Payments for FY 2014, 209999=MMSEAMedicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007, Public Law 110-173, 445537=During the comment period for the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule, we received a public comment that we considered to be outside the scope of that proposed rule. We stated in the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 53325) that we would consider this issue in future rulemaking as part of our annual review process. The commenter requested that CMS conduct an analysis of diagnosis code V45.88 (Status post administration of tPA (rtPA) in a different facility within the last 24 hours prior to admission to current facility). Diagnosis code V45.88 was created for use beginning October 1, 2008, to identify patients who are given tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) at one institution and then transferred and admitted to a comprehensive stroke center for further care. This situation has been referred to as the \u201cdrip-and-ship\u201d issue and was discussed at length in the FY 2009 IPPS proposed rule (73 FR 23563 through 23564) and final rule (73 FR 48493 through 48495), as well as the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule (75 FR 23899 through 23900) and final rule (75 FR 50102 through 50106). We refer readers to these previous discussions for detailed background information regarding this topic., 573279=CMS prepared the ICD-10 MS-DRGs Version 30.0 based on the FY 2013 MS-DRGs (Version 30.0) that we finalized in the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule. We posted a Definitions Manual of the ICD-10 MS-DRGs Version 30.0 on our ICD-10 MS-DRG Conversion Project Web site at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/ICD-10-MS-DRG-Conversion-Project.html. We also prepared a document that describes changes made from Version 29.0 to Version 30.0 to facilitate a review. We produced mainframe and computer software for Version 30.0, which was made available to the public in February 2013. Information on ordering the mainframe and computer software through NTIS can be found on the CMS Web site at: http://cms.hhs.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/ICD-10-MS-DRG-Conversion-Project.html under the \u201cRelated Links\u201d section. This ICD-10 MS-DRGs Version 30.0 computer software should facilitate additional review of the ICD-10 MS-DRGs conversion., 499685=Therefore, for FY 2014, we are proposing to reassign diagnosis codes V64.00 through V64.04, and V64.06 through V64.3 from MS-DRG 794 to MS-DRG 795. Diagnosis codes V64.00 through V64.04, and V64.06 through V64.3 would be added to the \u201conly secondary diagnosis\u201d list for MS-DRG 795. Diagnosis codes V64.41, V64.42, and V64.43 would continue to be assigned to MS-DRG 794. We are inviting public comments on this proposal., 537244=There are no proposed additions or deletions to the MS-DRG MCC List for FY 2014. There also are no proposed additions or deletions to the MS-DRG CC List for FY 2014. Therefore, there are no Tables 6I.1 through 6I.2 and 6J.1 through 6J.2 published for FY 2014., 712095=The applicant found 565 claims reporting the combination of ICD-9-CM procedures codes 02.93 and 01.20, and pointed out that these cases were coded with procedure code 01.20 in error because no new RNS\u00ae System implantations occurred after May 2009. The applicant analyzed these 565 claims and found that more than 90 percent of these cases had a primary or secondary diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, or dystonia. These diagnoses are FDA-approved indications for deep brain stimulation (DBS). In addition, the applicant noted that the total covered charges for these cases were less than the estimated charges for a full DBS system and hypothesized that these cases did not represent implantation of a full DBS system but implementation of leads only. The applicant contacted two hospitals that reported claims where total covered charges were less than the charges for a full DBS system, and the hospitals confirmed that their claims represented lead implantation alone. Therefore, for this second analysis, the applicant included all of the cases in MS-DRG 024 reported with a combination of ICD-9-CM procedures codes 02.93 and 86.95 and all of the cases in MS-DRG 024 reported with ICD-9-CM procedures codes 02.93 and 01.20 where the covered charges were greater than or equal to the estimated charges of a full DBS system. The applicant maintained that 485 claims from 130 providers met these criteria and that these data represented claims from the fourth calendar quarter of 2010 through the third calendar quarter of 2011, or FY 2011. Based on this assumption, the applicant calculated an average charge per case of $60,955. The applicant then removed DBS charges from the average charge per case. The applicant estimated charges for DBS and maintained that the average cost for a DBS system was $25,979. Similar to its first analysis, the applicant assumed a CCR of 0.50, or 100 percent markup, which resulted in estimated charges for DBS of $51,958. After removing DBS charges, the applicant standardized charges and then inflated the charges to the current period using the same methodology in the first analysis. The applicant then added charges for the RNS\u00ae System and determined a final inflated average standardized charge per case of $118,408. As noted above, although the applicant submitted data that related to the estimated cost of the RNS\u00ae System, the applicant noted that the cost of the technology was proprietary information. Using the FY 2014 Table 10 thresholds, the threshold for MS-DRG 024 is $78,039. Because the final inflated average standardized charge per case of $118,408 for MS-DRG 024 exceeds the threshold amount, the applicant maintained that the RNS\u00ae System would meet the cost criterion., 237472=6. FY 2016 Hospital VBP Program Measures, 413866=After computing the analyses described above by comparing both sets of MS-DRG relative weights computed with FY 2011 cost report data, we revisited RTI's July 2008 final report. We note that the impacts on relative weight and at the MDC level are generally consistent with those estimated by RTI in its modeling. RTI found that disaggregating the CCRs for medical supplies and devices would have the most impact on reducing charge compression, and that the largest impact was for MS-DRG 227. Similarly, as shown in the chart above, we estimate that the potential relative weight for MS-DRG 227 would experience the largest increase, 6.7 percent. Cardiac implants and spinal fusion procedures accounted for most of the 10 MS-DRGs with the largest incremental increases. In addition, RTI's July 2008 final report (pages 103 through 107) indicates that among the largest expected reductions are the MS-DRG relative weights for MS-DRGs associated with traumatic head injury and concussion, which are high users of CT scanning and MRI services. RTI's analyses were highly predictive for many of the MS-DRGs most sensitive to the effects of charge compression., 265698=3. ICRs for the Proposed Occupational Mix Adjustment to the Proposed FY 2014 Wage Index (Hospital Wage Index Occupational Mix Survey), 259552=b. Proposed New LTCHQR Program Quality Measures for the FY 2017 Payment Determination and Subsequent Payment Determinations, 350764=In the Addendum to this proposed rule, we set forth proposed changes to the amounts and factors for determining the proposed FY 2014 prospective standard Federal rate. We are proposing to establish the adjustments for wage levels, the labor-related share, the cost-of-living adjustment, and high-cost outliers, including the fixed-loss amount, and the LTCH cost-to-charge ratios (CCRs) under the LTCH PPS., 202261=DRADeficit Reduction Act of 2005, Public Law 109-171, 997472=On November 15, 2012, in a ruling in the case of Allina Health Services, et al., v. Sebelius (Allina), the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia (the court) held that the final policy of putting MA patient days in the Medicare fraction adopted in the FY 2005 IPPS final rule was not a logical outgrowth of the FY 2004 IPPS proposed rule. The court held that interested parties had not been put on notice that the Secretary might adopt a final policy of counting the days in the Medicare fraction and were not provided an adequate further opportunity for public comment., 552896=Section 503(a) of Public Law 108-173 included a requirement for updating ICD-9-CM codes twice a year instead of a single update on October 1 of each year. This requirement was included as part of the amendments to the Act relating to recognition of new technology under the IPPS. Section 503(a) amended section 1886(d)(5)(K) of the Act by adding a clause (vii) which states that the \u201cSecretary shall provide for the addition of new diagnosis and procedure codes on April 1 of each year, but the addition of such codes shall not require the Secretary to adjust the payment (or diagnosis-related group classification) . . . until the fiscal year that begins after such date.\u201d This requirement improves the recognition of new technologies under the IPPS system by providing information on these new technologies at an earlier date. Data will be available 6 months earlier than would be possible with updates occurring only once a year on October 1., 830021=We refer readers to the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (76 FR 51599 through 51600) for a detailed discussion of the policy and process for waiving Lugar status for the out-migration adjustment., 1000253=We also believe that our policy of counting patients enrolled in MA plans in the Medicare fraction was a logical outgrowth of the FY 2004 IPPS proposed rule, and, accordingly, have filed an appeal in the Allina case. However, in an abundance of caution and for the reasons discussed above, in this proposed rule, we are proposing to readopt the policy of counting the days of patients enrolled in MA plans in the Medicare fraction of the DPP. We are seeking public comments from interested parties that may support or oppose the proposal to include the MA patient days in the Medicare fraction of the DPP calculation for FY 2014 and subsequent years. We will evaluate these public comments and consider whether a further change in policy is warranted, and will include our final determination in the FY 2014 IPPS final rule. We are not proposing any change to the regulation text at this time, because the current text reflects the policy being proposed., 261477=11. Proposed LTCHQR Program Submission Waiver Requirements for the FY 2015 Payment Determination and Subsequent Payment Determinations, 678119=Section 1886(d)(5)(K)(i) of the Act requires the Secretary to \u201cestablish a mechanism to recognize the costs of new medical services and technologies under the payment system established under this subsection\u201d beginning with discharges on or after October 1, 2001. We believe it is reasonable to interpret this requirement to mean that the payment mechanism established by the Secretary recognizes only costs for those items that would otherwise be paid based on the prospective payment system (that is, \u201cthe payment system established under this subsection\u201d). As noted above, under section 1886(d)(1)(A)(iii) of the Act, the national adjusted DRG prospective payment rate is the amount of payment for the operating costs of inpatient hospital services, as defined in section 1886(a)(4) of the Act, for discharges on or after April 1, 1988. We understand this to mean that a new medical service or technology must be an operating cost of inpatient hospital services paid based on the prospective payment system, and not excluded from such costs, in order to be eligible for the new technology add-on payment. We point out that new technology add-on payments are based on the operating costs per case relative to the prospective payment rate as described in 42 CFR 412.88. Therefore, we believe that new technology add-on payments are appropriate only when the new technology is an operating cost of inpatient hospital services and are not appropriate when the new technology is excluded from such costs., 271170=3. Effects of Proposed Payment Adjustment for Low-Volume Hospitals for FY 2014, 356552=In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment period (72 FR 47140 through 47189), we adopted the MS-DRG patient classification system for the IPPS, effective October 1, 2007, to better recognize severity of illness in Medicare payment rates for acute care hospitals. The adoption of the MS-DRG system resulted in the expansion of the number of DRGs from 538 in FY 2007 to 745 in FY 2008. (Currently, there are 751 MS-DRGs.) By increasing the number of MS-DRGs and more fully taking into account patient severity of illness in Medicare payment rates for acute care hospitals, MS-DRGs encourage hospitals to improve their documentation and coding of patient diagnoses., 823682=Applications for FY 2015 reclassifications are due to the MGCRB by September 3, 2013 (the first working day of September 2013). We note that this is also the deadline for canceling a previous wage index reclassification withdrawal or termination under 42 CFR 412.273(d). As mentioned in section III.B. of the preamble of this proposed rule, although OMB has issued revisions on February 28, 2013 to its area delineations, we are not proposing to adopt those revisions for the FY 2014 wage index, and we will not be adopting the revisions before the September 3, 2013 deadline for applications for the FY 2015 wage index. Therefore, hospitals must apply for reclassifications based on the delineations we are using for FY 2014. Applications and other information about MGCRB reclassifications may be obtained, beginning in mid-July 2013, via the Internet on the CMS Web site at: http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Review-Boards/MGCRB/index.html?redirect=/MGCRB/02_instructions_and_applications.asp, or by calling the MGCRB at (410) 786-1174. The mailing address of the MGCRB is: 2520 Lord Baltimore Drive, Suite L, Baltimore, MD 21244-2670., 53708=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 4, 2015, 563545=The code freeze was discussed at multiple meetings of the ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee and public comment was actively solicited. The Committee evaluated all comments from participants attending the Committee meetings as well as written comments that were received. The Committee also considered the delay in implementation of ICD-10 until October 1, 2014. There was an announcement at the September 19, 2012 ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee meeting that a partial freeze of both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10 codes will be implemented as follows:, 639563=In order to provide an opportunity for public input regarding add-on payments for new medical services and technologies for FY 2014 prior to publication of this FY 2014 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule, we published a notice in the Federal Register on November 23, 2012 (77 FR 70163 through 70165), and held a town hall meeting at the CMS Headquarters Office in Baltimore, MD, on February 5, 2013. In the announcement notice for the meeting, we stated that the opinions and alternatives provided during the meeting would assist us in our evaluations of applications by allowing public discussion of the substantial clinical improvement criterion for each of the FY 2014 new medical service and technology add-on payment applications before the publication of this FY 2014 proposed rule., 255175=13. Proposed Reconsideration and Appeal Procedures for the FY 2015 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years, 186759=Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Department of Health and Human Services, Attention: CMS-1599-P, P.O. Box 8011, Baltimore, MD 21244-1850., 250665=d. Suspension of Data Collection for the FY 2014 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years, 396587=During the development of the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed and final rules, hospitals were still in the process of transitioning from the previous cost report Form CMS-2552-96 to the new cost report Form CMS-2552-10. Therefore, we were able to access only those cost reports in the FY 2010 HCRIS with fiscal year begin dates on or after October 1, 2009, and before May 1, 2010; that is, those cost reports on Form CMS-2552-96. Data from the Form CMS-2552-10 cost reports were not available because cost reports filed on the Form CMS-2552-10 were not accessible in the HCRIS. Further complicating matters was that, due to additional unforeseen technical difficulties, the corresponding information regarding charges for implantable devices on hospital claims was not yet available to us in the MedPAR file. Without the breakout in the MedPAR file of charges associated with implantable devices to correspond to the costs of implantable devices on the cost report, we believed that we had no choice but to continue computing the relative weights with the current CCR that combines the costs and charges for supplies and implantable devices. We stated in the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 53281 through 53283) that when we do have the necessary data for supplies and implantable devices on the claims in the MedPAR file to create distinct CCRs for the respective cost centers for supplies and implantable devices, we hoped that we would also have data for an analysis of creating distinct CCRs for CT scans, MRIs, and cardiac catheterization, which could then be finalized through rulemaking., 255038=12. Public Display Requirements for the FY 2016 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years, 328679=The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 111-148), enacted on March 23, 2010, and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-152), enacted on March 30, 2010, made a number of changes that affect the IPPS and the LTCH PPS. (Pub. L. 111-148 and Pub. L. 111-152 are collectively referred to as the \u201cAffordable Care Act.\u201d) A number of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act affect the updates to the IPPS and the LTCH PPS and providers and suppliers. The provisions of the Affordable Care Act that were applicable to the IPPS and the LTCH PPS for FYs 2010, 2011, and 2012 were implemented in the June 2, 2010 Federal Register notice (75 FR 31118), the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (75 FR 50042) and the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (76 FR 51476)., 742079=With regard to the newness criterion, the manufacturer submitted a Premarket Approval (PMA) application in support of obtaining FDA approval for the MitraClip\u00ae System. Effective October 1, 2010, ICD-9-CM procedure code 35.97 (Percutaneous mitral valve repair with implant) was created to identify and describe the MitraClip\u00ae technology. On March 20, 2013, a meeting was held by the Circulatory System Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee of the FDA to discuss, make recommendations, and vote on information related to the PMA application for the MitraClip\u00ae System. Specifically, the Committee was charged with determining if the data presented by the applicant demonstrated a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. We refer readers to the following FDA Web site for additional detailed information and meeting materials regarding the MitraClip\u00ae System http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/Calendar/ucm339809.htm. In addition, a summary of the March 20, 2013 meeting can be located on the following FDA Web site http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/MedicalDevices/MedicalDevicesAdvisoryCommittee/CirculatorySystemDevicesPanel/UCM345235.pdf. We are inviting public comments regarding how the MitraClip\u00ae System meets the newness criterion., 836751=Hospitals should examine Table 2, which is listed in section VI. of the Addendum to this proposed rule and available via the Internet on the CMS Web site at: http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/Wage-Index-Files-Items/FY_2014_Wage_Index_Home_Page.html. Table 2 contains each hospital's adjusted average hourly wage used to construct the wage index values for the past 3 years, including the FY 2010 data used to construct the proposed FY 2014 wage index. We note that the hospital average hourly wages shown in Table 2 only reflect changes made to a hospital's data that were transmitted to CMS by March 4, 2013., 366490=As in prior years, the FY 2008, FY 2009, and FY 2010 MedPAR files are available to the public to allow independent analysis of the FY 2008 and FY 2009 documentation and coding effects. Interested individuals may still order these files through the Web site at: http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Files-for-Order/LimitedDataSets/ by clicking on MedPAR Limited Data Set (LDS)-Hospital (National). This Web page describes the file and provides directions and further detailed instructions for how to order., 966645=We intend to update these numbers in the FY 2014 final rule based on the latest available cost report data., 952554=Puerto Rico hospitals are paid a blended rate for their inpatient operating costs based on 75 percent of the national standardized amount and 25 percent of the Puerto Rico-specific standardized amount. Section 1886(d)(9)(C)(i) of the Act is the basis for determining the applicable percentage increase applied to the Puerto Rico-specific standardized amount. Section 401(c) of Public Law 108-173 amended section 1886(d)(9)(C)(i) of the Act, which states that, for discharges occurring in a fiscal year (beginning with FY 2004), the Secretary shall compute an average standardized amount for hospitals located in any area of Puerto Rico that is equal to the average standardized amount computed under subclause (I) for fiscal year 2003 for hospitals in a large urban area (or, beginning with FY 2005, for all hospitals in the previous fiscal year) increased by the applicable percentage increase under subsection (b)(3)(B) for the fiscal year involved. Therefore, the update to the Puerto Rico-specific operating standardized amount equals the applicable percentage increase set forth in section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i) of the Act, as amended by sections 3401(a) and 10319(a) of the Affordable Care Act (that is, the same update factor as for all other hospitals subject to the IPPS). Accordingly, we are proposing an applicable percentage increase to the Puerto Rico-specific operating standardized amount of 1.8 percent for FY 2014. The regulations at \u00a7 412.211(c) currently set the update factor for the Puerto Rico-specific operating standardized amount equal to the update factor applied to the national standardized amount for all IPPS hospitals. Therefore, it is not necessary to propose any changes to the existing regulatory text., 259344=a.

We summarize these comments below or, if applicable, indicate that there were no comments received, at the end of each discussion of the individual applications in this proposed rule., 827962=In the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (76 FR 51599 through 51600), we adopted the policy that, beginning with FY 2012, an eligible hospital that waives its Lugar status in order to receive the out-migration adjustment has effectively waived its deemed urban status and, thus, is rural for all purposes under the IPPS, including being considered rural for the DSH payment adjustment, effective for the fiscal year in which the hospital receives the out-migration adjustment. (We refer readers to a discussion of DSH payment adjustment under section V.E. of the preamble of this proposed rule.), 805204=Based on the 2010 occupational mix survey data, we determined (in Step 7 of the occupational mix calculation) that the national percentage of hospital employees in the nurse category is 43.44 percent, and the national percentage of hospital employees in the all other occupations category is 56.56 percent. At the CBSA level, the percentage of hospital employees in the nurse category ranged from a low of 21.9 percent in one CBSA, to a high of 62.0 percent in another CBSA., 625332=The regulations at 42 CFR 412.87 implement these provisions and specify three criteria for a new medical service or technology to receive the additional payment: (1) The medical service or technology must be new; (2) the medical service or technology must be costly such that the DRG rate otherwise applicable to discharges involving the medical service or technology is determined to be inadequate; and (3) the service or technology must demonstrate a substantial clinical improvement over existing services or technologies. Below we highlight some of the major statutory and regulatory provisions relevant to the new technology add-on payment criteria as well as other information. For a complete discussion on the new technology add-on payment criteria, we refer readers to the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (76 FR 51572 through 51574)., 472271=We also analyzed claims data from the FY 2012 MedPAR file for MS-DRGs 228, 229, and 230 as illustrated below., 246276=b.

Proposed FY 2014 LTCH PPS Annual Market Basket Increase, 785725=The wage data for the proposed FY 2014 wage index were obtained from Worksheet S-3 of the Medicare cost report for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2009, and before October 1, 2010. For wage index purposes, we refer to cost reports during this period as the \u201cFY 2010 cost report,\u201d the \u201cFY 2010 wage data,\u201d or the \u201cFY 2010 data.\u201d Instructions for completing the wage index sections of Worksheet S-3 are included in the Provider Reimbursement Manual (PRM), Part 2 (Pub. No. 15-2), Chapter 36, Sections 3605.2 and 3605.3 for Form CMS-2552-96 and Chapter 40, Sections 4005.2 through 4005.4 for Form CMS-2552-10. Hospitals with cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2009 and before May 1, 2010 reported FY 2010 data on Form CMS-2552-96. Hospitals with cost reporting periods beginning on or after May 1, 2010 and before October 1, 2010 reported FY 2010 data on the new Form CMS-2552-10. The data file used to construct the wage index includes FY 2010 data submitted to us as of March 1, 2013. As in past years, we performed an extensive review of the wage data, mostly through the use of edits designed to identify aberrant data., 923895=In order to estimate capital purchases using data on depreciation expenses, the expected life for each cost category (building and fixed equipment, movable equipment, and interest) is needed to calculate vintage weights. We used FY 2010 Medicare cost reports to determine the expected life of building and fixed equipment and of movable equipment. The expected life of any piece of equipment can be determined by dividing the value of the asset (excluding fully depreciated assets) by its current year depreciation amount. This calculation yields the estimated useful life of an asset if depreciation were to continue at current year levels, assuming straight-line depreciation. From the FY 2010 Medicare cost reports, the proposed expected life of building and fixed equipment was determined to be 26 years, and the proposed expected life of movable equipment was determined to be 12 years. The FY 2006-based CIPI was based on an expected life of building and fixed equipment of 25 years and 12 years as the expected life for movable equipment., 215989=TMATMA [Transitional Medical Assistance], Abstinence Education, and QI [Qualifying Individuals] Programs Extension Act of 2007, Public Law 110-90, 628583=In the September 7, 2001 final rule that established the new technology add-on payment regulations (66 FR 46917), we discussed the issue of whether the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule at 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164 applies to claims information that providers submit with applications for new technology add-on payments. We refer readers to the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (76 FR 51573) for complete information on this issue., 231158=I. Proposed FY 2014 Wage Index Adjustment Based on Commuting Patterns of Hospital Employees, 787748=In constructing the proposed FY 2014 wage index, we included the wage data for facilities that were IPPS hospitals in FY 2010, inclusive of those facilities that have since terminated their participation in the program as hospitals, as long as those data did not fail any of our edits for reasonableness. We believe that including the wage data for these hospitals is, in general, appropriate to reflect the economic conditions in the various labor market areas during the relevant past period and to ensure that the current wage index represents the labor market area's current wages as compared to the national average of wages. However, we excluded the wage data for CAHs as discussed in the FY 2004 IPPS final rule (68 FR 45397 through 45398). For this proposed rule, we removed 4 hospitals that converted to CAH status on or after February 14, 2012, the cut-off date for CAH exclusion from the FY 2013 wage index, and through and including February 14, 2013, the cut-off date for CAH exclusion from the FY 2014 wage index. After removing hospitals with aberrant data and hospitals that converted to CAH status, the proposed FY 2014 wage index is calculated based on 3,427 hospitals., 536479=A complete updated MCC, CC, and Non-CC Exclusions List is available through the Internet on the CMS Web site at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/index.html.

Reasonable cost is determined under the provisions of section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act and existing regulations under 42 CFR Parts 413 and 415., 373139=We note again that delaying full implementation of the prospective portion of the adjustment required under section 7(b)(1)(A) of Public Law 110-90 until FY 2013 resulted in payments in FY 2010 through FY 2012 being overstated. These overpayments could not be recovered by CMS as section 7(b)(1)(B) of Public Law 110-90 limited recoupments to overpayments made in FY 2008 and FY 2009., 738229=We also are concerned that on April 24, 2013, the FDA announced that, based on its investigation into a small number of complaints that the delivery system of the device had separated at the tip of the inner catheter, Cook Medical has initiated a nationwide/global voluntary recall of its Zilver\u00ae PTX\u00ae Drug Eluting Peripheral Stent. We refer readers to http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm349421.htm?source=govdelivery for more information regarding this announcement., 394637=In the FY 2009 IPPS final rule (73 FR 48468), we stated that, due to what is typically a 3-year lag between the reporting of cost report data and the availability for use in ratesetting, we anticipated that we might be able to use data from the new \u201cImplantable Devices Charged to Patients\u201d cost center to develop a CCR for \u201cImplantable Devices Charged to Patients\u201d in the FY 2012 or FY 2013 IPPS rulemaking cycle. However, as noted in the FY 2010 IPPS/RY 2010 LTCH PPS final rule (74 FR 43782), due to delays in the issuance of the revised cost report Form CMS 2552-10, we determined that a new CCR for \u201cImplantable Devices Charged to Patients\u201d might not be available before FY 2013. Similarly, when we finalized the decision in the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule to add new cost centers for CT scans, MRIs, and cardiac catheterization, we explained that data from any new cost centers that may be created will not be available until at least 3 years after they are first used (75 FR 50077). In preparation for the FY 2012 IPPS rulemaking, we checked the availability of data in the \u201cImplantable Devices Charged to Patients\u201d cost center on the FY 2009 cost reports, but we did not believe that there was a sufficient amount of data from which to generate a meaningful analysis in this particular situation. Therefore, we did not propose to use data from the \u201cImplantable Devices Charged to Patients\u201d cost center to create a distinct CCR for \u201cImplantable Devices Charged to Patients\u201d for use in calculating the MS-DRG relative weights for FY 2012. We indicated that we would reassess the availability of data for the \u201cImplantable Devices Charged to Patients\u201d cost center for the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS rulemaking cycle and, if appropriate, we would propose to create a distinct CCR at that time., 367461=Mailing address if using the U.S. Postal Service:Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,RDDC Account,Accounting Division,P.O. Box 7520,Baltimore, MD 21207-0520., 237385=5. FY 2015 Hospital VBP Program Measures, 845534=In those circumstances where a hospital requested a correction to its wage index data before CMS calculated the final wage index (that is, by the June 3, 2013 deadline), and CMS acknowledges that the error in the hospital's wage index data was caused by CMS' or the fiscal intermediary's (or, if applicable, the MAC's) mishandling of the data, we believe that the hospital should not be penalized by our delay in publishing or implementing the correction. As with our current policy, we indicated that the provision is not available to a hospital seeking to revise another hospital's data. In addition, the provision cannot be used to correct prior years' wage index data; and it can only be used for the current Federal fiscal year. In situations where our policies would allow midyear corrections other than those specified in 42 CFR 412.64(k)(2)(ii), we continue to believe that it is appropriate to make prospective-only corrections to the wage index., 429064=Beginning on or after January 1, 2011, hospitals were required to begin reporting POA indicators using the 5010 electronic transmittal standards format. The 5010 format removes the need to report a POA indicator of \u201c1\u201d for codes that are exempt from POA reporting. We have issued CMS instructions on this reporting change as a One-Time Notification, Pub. No. 100-20, Transmittal No. 756, Change Request 7024, effective on August 13, 2010, which can be located at the following link on the CMS Web site: http://www.cms.gov/manuals/downloads/Pub100_20.pdf., 209121=MIPPAMedicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008, Public Law 110-275, 944970=In accordance with section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i) of the Act, each year we update the national standardized amount for inpatient operating costs by a factor called the \u201capplicable percentage increase.\u201d Section 1886(b)(3)(B) of the Act, as amended by sections 3401(a) and 10319(a) of the Affordable Care Act, sets the applicable percentage increase under the IPPS for FY 2014 as equal to the rate-of-increase in the hospital market basket for IPPS hospitals in all areas, subject to a reduction of 2.0 percentage points if the hospital fails to submit quality information under rules established by the Secretary in accordance with section 1886(b)(3)(B)(viii) of the Act, and then subject to an adjustment based on changes in economy-wide productivity (the multifactor productivity (MFP) adjustment), and an additional reduction of 0.3 percentage point. Sections 1886(b)(3)(B)(xi) and (b)(3)(B)(xii) of the Act, as added by section 3401(a) of the Affordable Care Act, state that application of the MFP adjustment and the additional FY 2014 adjustment of 0.3 percentage point may result in the applicable percentage increase being less than zero., 575571=CMS provided an overview of this hospital payment impact study at the March 5, 2012 ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee meeting. This presentation followed presentations on the creation of ICD-10 MS-DRGs Version 29.0. A summary report of this meeting can be found on the CMS Web site at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD9ProviderDiagnosticCodes/index.html. At this March 2012 meeting, CMS announced that it would produce an update on this impact study based on an updated version of the ICD 10 MS-DRGs. This update of the impact study was presented at the March 5, 2013 ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee meeting. The updated paper is posted on CMS' Web site at: http://cms.hhs.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/ICD-10-MS-DRG-Conversion-Project.html under the \u201cDownloads\u201d section. Information on the March 5, 2013 ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee meeting can be found on the CMS Web site at: http://cms.hhs.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD9ProviderDiagnosticCodes/ICD-9-CM-C-and-M-Meeting-Materials.html. This update of the impact paper and the ICD-10 MS-DRG Version 30.0 software will provide additional information to the public who are evaluating the conversion of the MS-DRGs to ICD-10 MS-DRG., 374188=As discussed in section II.D.3. of this preamble, section 7(b)(1)(B) of Public Law 110-90 requires the Secretary to make an adjustment to the standardized amounts under section 1886(d) of the Act to offset the estimated increase or decrease in aggregate payments for FY 2008 and FY 2009 (including interest) resulting from the difference between the estimated actual documentation and coding effect and the documentation and coding adjustments applied under section 7(a) of Public Law 110-90. This determination must be based on a retrospective evaluation of claims data. Our actuaries estimated that this 5.8 percentage point increase resulted in an increase in aggregate payments of approximately $6.9 billion. Therefore, as discussed in the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (75 FR 50062 through 50067), we determined that an aggregate adjustment of \u22125.8 percent in FYs 2011 and 2012 would be necessary in order to meet the requirements of section 7(b)(1)(B) of Public Law 110-90 to adjust the standardized amounts for discharges occurring in FYs 2010, 2011, and/or 2012 to offset the estimated amount of the increase in aggregate payments (including interest) in FYs 2008 and 2009., 815815=The areas affected by the proposed rural, imputed, and frontier floor policies for the proposed FY 2014 wage index are identified in Table 4D associated with this proposed rule and available on the CMS Web site., 984897=As described above, for FYs 2005 through 2010 and FY 2014 and subsequent fiscal years, the discharge determination would be made based on the hospital's number of total discharges, that is, Medicare and non-Medicare discharges. The hospital's most recently submitted cost report is used to determine if the hospital meets the discharge criterion to receive the low-volume hospital payment adjustment in the current year (proposed \u00a7 412.101(b)(2)(i)). We use cost report data to determine if a hospital meets the discharge criterion because this is the best available data source that includes information on both Medicare and non-Medicare discharges. We note that, for FYs 2011, 2012, and 2013, we used the most recently available MedPAR data to determine the hospital's Medicare discharges because only Medicare discharges were used to determine if a hospital met the discharge criterion for those years. In addition to a discharge criterion, the eligibility for the low-volume hospital payment adjustment also would be dependent upon the hospital meeting the mileage criterion specified at proposed \u00a7 412.101(b)(2)(i). Specifically, to meet the mileage criterion to qualify for the low-volume hospital payment adjustment for FY 2014 and subsequent fiscal years, a hospital must be located more than 25 road miles from the nearest subsection (d) hospital., 927508=For movable equipment vintage weights, the real annual capital purchase amounts for movable equipment were used to capture the actual amount of the physical acquisition, net of price inflation. This real annual purchase amount for movable equipment was calculated by deflating the nominal annual purchase amounts by the movable equipment price proxy, the PPI for machinery and equipment. Based on our determination that movable equipment has an expected life of 12 years, the vintage weights for movable equipment represent the average expenditure for movable equipment over a 12-year period. With real movable equipment purchase estimates available back to 1963, thirty-six 12-year periods were averaged to determine the average vintage weights for movable equipment that are representative of average movable equipment purchase patterns over time. Vintage weights for each 12-year period are calculated by dividing the real movable capital purchase amount for any given year by the total amount of purchases in the 12-year period. This calculation was done for each year in the 12-year period and for each of the thirty-six 12-year periods. We used the average of each year across the thirty-six 12-year periods to determine the average movable equipment vintage weights for the proposed FY 2010-based CIPI., 262549=b. Proposed New Quality Measures Beginning with the FY 2016 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years, 779490=In order to implement these changes for the IPPS, it is necessary to identify the new area designation for each county and hospital in the country. While the revisions OMB published on February 28, 2013 are not as sweeping as the changes OMB announced in 2003, the February 28, 2013 bulletin does contain a number of significant changes. For example, there are new CBSAs, urban counties that become rural, rural counties that become urban, and existing CBSAs that have been split apart. In addition, the effect of the new designations on various hospital reclassifications, the outmigration adjustment (established by section 505 of Pub. L. 108-173), and treatment of hospitals located in certain rural counties (that is, \u201cLugar\u201d hospitals) provided for under section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act must be considered. These are just a few of the many issues that need to be considereed regarding the effects of the new designations prior to proposing and establishing policies., 524621=We received a request to consider removing atherosclerosis and aneurysm codes from the CC Exclusion List for diagnosis code 440.4 (Chronic total occlusion of artery of the extremities). For FY 2013, we changed the designation of diagnosis code 440.4 from a non-CC level to a CC level.

The technology is not described by any current ICD-9-CM procedure codes. The applicant applied for a new ICD-9-CM procedure code for consideration at the March 5, 2013 ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee Meeting.

We note that any final decisions on new codes approved at the March 5, 2013 ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee meeting will be included in the ICD-9-CM code addendum posted on the CMS Web site in June 2013 at: http://cms.hhs.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD9ProviderDiagnosticCodes/addendum.html. In addition, code revisions that were discussed at the March 5, 2013 ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee meeting but that could not be finalized in time to include them in the tables for this proposed rule will be included in the appropriate table for the final rule (the tables for both the proposed rule and the final rule are available via the Internet on the CMS Web site)., 782746=The proposed FY 2014 wage index includes the following categories of data associated with costs paid under the IPPS (as well as outpatient costs):, 352594=Under section 1805(b) of the Act, MedPAC is required to submit a report to Congress, no later than March 15 of each year, in which MedPAC reviews and makes recommendations on Medicare payment policies. MedPAC's March 2013 recommendations concerning hospital inpatient payment policies address the update factor for hospital inpatient operating costs and capital-related costs under the IPPS, for hospitals and distinct part hospital units excluded from the IPPS. We address these recommendations in Appendix B of this proposed rule.

Proposed Domain Reclassification and Domain Weighting for the FY 2017 Hospital VBP Program, 765180=In conclusion, the applicant cited data from the ACCESS-EU study as presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in August 2012, which demonstrated improvement in disease-specific quality of life measures including the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire and Six Minute Walk Test., 325391=The Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for LTCHs applies to hospitals described in section 1886(d)(1)(B)(iv) of the Act effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2002. The LTCH PPS was established under the authority of sections 123 of the BBRA and section 307(b) of the BIPA (as codified under section 1886(m)(1) of the Act). During the 5-year (optional) transition period, a LTCH's payment under the PPS was based on an increasing proportion of the LTCH Federal rate with a corresponding decreasing proportion based on reasonable cost principles. Effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2006, all LTCHs are paid 100 percent of the Federal rate. The existing regulations governing payment under the LTCH PPS are located in 42 CFR Part 412, Subpart O. Beginning October 1, 2009, we issue the annual updates to the LTCH PPS in the same documents that update the IPPS (73 FR 26797 through 26798)., 504281=To reflect changes in the UB-04 code set maintained by the National Uniform Billing Committee (NUBC), we are proposing to add the following new discharge status codes to the CMS GROUPER and the MCE logic effective October 1, 2013., 245066=VIII. Proposed Changes to the Long-Term Care Hospital Prospective Payment System (LTCH PPS) for FY 2014, 944002=Rebasing the CIPI from FY 2006 to FY 2010 decreased the percent change in the forecasted update for FY 2014 by 0.2 percentage point, from 1.4 percent to 1.2 percent, as shown in Table IV09. The difference in the forecasted market basket update for FY 2014 is primarily due to the rebasing of the index to FY 2010 and revising the base year cost weights to incorporate the FY 2010 Medicare cost report data., 837644=We will release the final wage index data public use files in early May 2013 on the Internet at: http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/Wage-Index-Files-Items/FY_2014_Wage_Index_Home_Page.html. The May 2013 public use files are made available solely for the limited purpose of identifying any potential errors made by CMS or the fiscal intermediary/MAC in the entry of the final wage index data that resulted from the correction process described above (revisions submitted to CMS by the fiscal intermediaries/MACs by April 10, 2013). If, after reviewing the May 2013 final public use files, a hospital believes that its wage or occupational mix data are incorrect due to a fiscal intermediary/MAC or CMS error in the entry or tabulation of the final data, the hospital should send a letter to both its fiscal intermediary/MAC and CMS that outlines why the hospital believes an error exists and provide all supporting information, including relevant dates (for example, when it first became aware of the error). CMS and the fiscal intermediaries (or, if applicable, the MACs) must receive these requests no later than June 3, 2013., 869255=Therefore, instead of using the less detailed, less accurate Annual I-O data, we are proposing to age the 2002 Benchmark I-O data forward to FY 2010. The methodology we are proposing to use to age the data forward involves applying the annual price changes from the respective price proxies to the appropriate cost categories. We repeat this practice for each year. We also are proposing that, if more recent BEA benchmark I-O data for 2007 is released between the proposed and final rule with sufficient time to incorporate such data into the final rule, we would incorporate these data into the FY 2010-based IPPS market basket for the final rule. The 2007 BEA I-O data is expected to be released in the summer of 2013., 439252=CMS encourages input from our stakeholders concerning the annual IPPS updates when that input is made available to us by early December of the year prior to the next annual proposed rule update. For example, to be considered for any updates or changes in FY 2014, comments and suggestions should have been submitted by early December 2012. The comments that were submitted in a timely manner are discussed below in this section., 813889=The wage index and impact tables associated with this FY 2014 proposed rule that are available on the CMS Web site include the application of the proposed imputed floor policy at \u00a7 412.64(h)(4) and a proposed national budget neutrality adjustment for the proposed rural floor (which includes the proposed imputed floor). There are 35 hospitals in New Jersey that would receive an increase in their FY 2014 wage index due to the imputed floor policy. The proposed wage index and impact tables for this proposed rule also reflect the application of the alternative methodology for computing the imputed floor, which will benefit four hospitals in Rhode Island., 972287=Based on an analysis we conducted for the FY 2005 IPPS final rule (69 FR 49099 through 49102), a 25-percent low-volume hospital payment adjustment to all qualifying hospitals with less than 200 discharges was found to be most consistent with the statutory requirement to provide relief to low-volume hospitals where there is empirical evidence that higher incremental costs are associated with low numbers of total discharges. In the FY 2006 IPPS final rule (70 FR 47432 through 47434), we stated that multivariate analyses supported the existing low-volume hospital payment adjustment implemented in FY 2005. Therefore, the low-volume hospital payment adjustment of an additional 25 percent continued to be provided for qualifying hospitals with less than 200 discharges., 1002292=Currently, Medicare DSH adjustment payments are calculated under a statutory formula that considers the hospital's Medicare utilization attributable to beneficiaries who also receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits and the hospital's Medicaid utilization. Beginning for discharges in FY 2014, hospitals that qualify for Medicare DSH payments under section 1886(d)(5)(F) will receive 25 percent of the amount they previously would have received under the current statutory formula for Medicare DSH payments. This provision applies equally to hospitals that qualify for DSH payments under section 1886(d)(5)(F)(i)(II) of the Act, the so-called Pickle hospitals. Pursuant to new section 1886(r), Pickle hospitals would receive 25 percent of the 35 percent add-on adjustment for which they would otherwise qualify under section 1886(d)(5)(F)(i)(II). The remaining amount, equal to an estimate of 75 percent of what otherwise would have been paid as Medicare DSH payments, reduced to reflect changes in the percentage of individuals under age 65 who are uninsured, will become available to make additional payments to each hospital that qualifies for Medicare DSH payments and that has uncompensated care. The payments to each hospital for a fiscal year will be based on the hospital's amount of uncompensated care for a given time period relative to the total amount of uncompensated care for that same time period reported by all hospitals that receive Medicare DSH payments for that fiscal year., 426122=As discussed in previous IPPS proposed and final rules, there are five POA indicator reporting options, as defined by the ICD-9-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting. Under the HAC policy, we treat HACs coded with \u201cY\u201d and \u201cW\u201d indicators as POA and allow the condition on its own to cause an increased payment at the CC/MCC level. We treat HACs coded with \u201cN\u201d and \u201cU\u201d indicators as Not Present on Admission (NPOA) and do not allow the condition on its own to cause an increased payment at the CC/MCC level. We refer readers to the following rules for a detailed discussion: the FY 2009 IPPS proposed rule (73 FR 23559) and final rule (73 FR 48486 through 48487); the FY 2010 IPPS/RY 2010 LTCH PPS proposed rule (74 FR 24106) and final rule (74 FR 43784 through 43785); the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule (75 FR 23881 through 23882) and final rule (75 FR 50081 through 50082); the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule (76 FR 25812 through 25813) and final rule (76 FR 51506 through 51507); and the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule (77 FR 27893 through 27894) and final rule (77 FR 53284 through 53285)., 964374=We are proposing that, in addition to meeting other criteria, a hospital, if it is to qualify for initial RRC status for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2013, must have, as the number of discharges for its cost reporting period that began during FY 2011 (based on a combination of FY 2010 and FY 2011 cost report data as explained in the preceding paragraph), at least\u2014, 268314=IV. Proposed Changes to Payment Rates for Excluded Hospitals: Rate-of-Increase Percentages for FY 2014, 258365=6. Previously Adopted Quality Measures for the FY 2016 Payment Determination and Subsequent Payment Determinations, 901773=In addition to the professional services listed above, we also classify a proportion of the expenses under NAICS 55, Management of Companies and Enterprises, into the professional fees: labor-related cost category as was done in the previous rebasing. The NAICS 55 data are mostly comprised of corporate, subsidiary, and regional managing offices, or otherwise referred to as home offices. As was done for the FY 2006-based IPPS market basket we are proposing to include only a portion of the home office costs in the labor related share as not all hospitals are located in the same geographic area as their home office., 263648=d. Reporting Requirements for the FY 2016 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years, 566872=CMS is currently processing all 25 diagnosis codes and 25 procedure codes submitted on electronic hospital inpatient claims. Prior to January 1, 2011, hospitals could submit up to 25 diagnoses and 25 procedures. However, CMS' system limitations allowed for the processing of only the first 9 diagnosis codes and 6 procedure codes. We discussed this change in processing claims in the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (75 FR 50127), in the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule (76 FR 25843), in a correction notice issued in the Federal Register on June 14, 2011 (76 FR 24633), and in the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (76 FR 51553). As discussed in these prior rules, CMS undertook an expansion of our internal system capability so that we are able to process up to 25 diagnoses and 25 procedures on hospital inpatient claims as part of the HIPAA ASC X12 Technical Reports Type 3, Version 005010 (Version 5010) standards system update. We recognize the value of the additional information provided by this coded data for multiple uses such as for payment, quality measures, outcome analysis, and other important uses. We will continue to process up to 25 diagnosis codes and 25 procedure codes when received on the 5010 format., 739263=Abbott Vascular submitted an application for new technology add-on payments for the MitraClip\u00ae System for FY 2014. The MitraClip\u00ae System is a transcatheter mitral valve system that includes a MitraClip\u00ae device implant, a Steerable Guide Catheter, and a Clip Delivery System. It is designed to perform reconstruction of the insufficient mitral valve for high risk patients who are not candidates for conventional open mitral valve surgery., 676086=We note, if Kcentra TM were to be approved for new technology add-on payments, we do not believe such payments would be available with respect to discharges for which the hospital receives an add-on payment for blood clotting factor administered to a Medicare beneficiary with hemophilia who is a hospital inpatient. Under section 1886(d)(1)(A)(iii) of the Act, the national adjusted DRG prospective payment rate is \u201cthe amount of the payment with respect to the operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in subsection (a)(4) of this section)\u201d for discharges on or after April 1, 1988. Section 1886(a)(4) of the Act excludes from the term \u201coperating costs of inpatient hospital services\u201d the costs with respect to administering blood clotting factors to individuals with hemophilia. The costs of administering blood clotting factor to Medicare beneficiaries who have hemophilia and are hospital inpatients are paid separately from the IPPS. (For information on how the clotting factor add-on payment is made, we refer readers to section 20.7.3 of Chapter Three of the Medicare Claims Processing Manual, which can be downloaded from the CMS Web site at: http://cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/clm104c03.pdf.) If Kcentra TM is approved by FDA as a blood clotting factor, we believe that it may be eligible for clotting factor add-on payments when administered to Medicare beneficiaries with hemophilia. CMS would make an add-on payment for Kcentra TM for such discharges in accordance with our policy for payment of blood clotting factor, and it would be excluded from the operating costs of inpatient hospital services as set forth in section 1886(a)(4) of the Act., 516046=In the September 1, 1987 final notice (52 FR 33143) concerning changes to the DRG classification system, we modified the GROUPER logic so that certain diagnoses included on the standard list of CCs would not be considered valid CCs in combination with a particular principal diagnosis. We created the CC Exclusions List for the following reasons: (1) To preclude coding of CCs for closely related conditions; (2) to preclude duplicative or inconsistent coding from being treated as CCs; and (3) to ensure that cases are appropriately classified between the complicated and uncomplicated DRGs in a pair. As we indicated above, we developed a list of diagnoses, using physician panels, to include those diagnoses that, when present as a secondary condition, would be considered a substantial complication or comorbidity. In previous years, we have made changes to the list of CCs, either by adding new CCs or deleting CCs already on the list., 983859=In accordance with section 1886(d)(12) of the Act, as amended, beginning with FY 2014, the low-volume hospital definition and payment adjustment methodology will revert back to the statutory requirements that were in effect prior to the amendments made by the Affordable Care Act and the ATRA. Therefore, consistent with section 1886(d)(12) of the Act, as amended, under the proposed conforming changes to \u00a7 412.101(b)(2), effective for FY 2014 and subsequent years, in order to qualify as a low-volume hospital, a subsection (d) hospital must be more than 25 road miles from another subsection (d) hospital and have less than 200 discharges (that is, less than 200 discharges total, including both Medicare and non-Medicare discharges) during the fiscal year. Under our existing policy, effective for FY 2014 and subsequent years, qualifying hospitals would receive the low-volume hospital payment adjustment of an additional 25 percent for discharges occurring during the fiscal year., 246373=3. Development of the Proposed FY 2014 MS-LTC-DRG Relative Weights, 626334=Under the first criterion, as reflected in \u00a7 412.87(b)(2), a specific medical service or technology will be considered \u201cnew\u201d for purposes of new medical service or technology add-on payments until such time as Medicare data are available to fully reflect the cost of the technology in the MS-DRG weights through recalibration. We note that we do not consider a service or technology to be new if it is substantially similar to one or more existing technologies. That is, even if a technology receives a new FDA approval, it may not necessarily be considered \u201cnew\u201d for purposes of new technology add-on payments if it is \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to a technology that was approved by FDA and has been on the market for more than 2 to 3 years. In the FY 2006 IPPS final rule (70 FR 47351) and the FY 2010 IPPS/RY 2010 LTCH PPS final rule (74 FR 43813 and 43814), we explained our policy regarding substantial similarity in detail., 955744=Section 4202(b) of Public Law 105-33 states, in part, \u201c[a]ny hospital classified as an RRC by the Secretary . . . for fiscal year 1991 shall be classified as such an RRC for fiscal year 1998 and each subsequent year.\u201d In the August 29, 1997 IPPS final rule with comment period (62 FR 45999), CMS reinstated RRC status for all hospitals that lost the status due to triennial review or MGCRB reclassification. However, CMS did not reinstate the status of hospitals that lost RRC status because they were now urban for all purposes because of the OMB designation of their geographic area as urban. Subsequently, in the August 1, 2000 IPPS final rule (65 FR 47089), we indicated that we were revisiting that decision. Specifically, we stated that we would permit hospitals that previously qualified as an RRC and lost their status due to OMB redesignation of the county in which they are located from rural to urban, to be reinstated as an RRC. Otherwise, a hospital seeking RRC status must satisfy all of the other applicable criteria. We use the definitions of \u201curban\u201d and \u201crural\u201d specified in Subpart D of 42 CFR Part 412. One of the criteria under which a hospital may qualify as an RRC is to have 275 or more beds available for use (\u00a7 412.96(b)(1)(ii)). A rural hospital that does not meet the bed size requirement can qualify as an RRC if the hospital meets two mandatory prerequisites (a minimum CMI and a minimum number of discharges), and at least one of three optional criteria (relating to specialty composition of medical staff, source of inpatients, or referral volume). (We refer readers to \u00a7 412.96(c)(1) through (c)(5) and the September 30, 1988 Federal Register (53 FR 38513).) With respect to the two mandatory prerequisites, a hospital may be classified as an RRC if\u2014, 911486=In the FY 2010 IPPS/RY 2010 LTCH PPS final rule (74 FR 43857), we adopted the use of the FY 2006-based IPPS operating market basket percentage increase to update the target amounts for children's hospitals, PPS-excluded cancer hospitals and religious nonmedical health care institutions (RNHCIs). Children's hospitals and PPS-excluded cancer hospitals and RNHCIs are still reimbursed solely under the reasonable cost-based system, subject to the rate-of-increase limits. Under these limits, an annual target amount (expressed in terms of the inpatient operating cost per discharge) is set for each hospital based on the hospital's own historical cost experience trended forward by the applicable rate-of-increase percentages., 571239=We reviewed comments on the ICD-10 MS-DRGs Version 28.0 and made updates as a result of these comments. We called the updated version the ICD-10 MS DRGs Version 28 R1. We posted a Definitions Manual of ICD-10 MS-DRGs Version 28 R1 on our ICD-10 MS-DRG Conversion Project Web site at: http://cms.hhs.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/ICD10-MS-DRG-Conversion-Project.html. To make the review of Version 28 R1 updates easier for the public, we also made available pilot software on a CD ROM that could be ordered through the National Technical Information Service (NTIS). A link to the NTIS ordering page was provided on the CMS ICD-10 MS-DRG Web page. We stated that we believed that, by providing the ICD-10 MS-DRG Version 28 R1 Pilot Software (distributed on CD ROM), the public would be able to more easily review and provide feedback on updates to the ICD-10 MS-DRGs. We discussed the updated ICD-10 MS-DRGs Version 28 R1 at the September 14, 2011 ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee meeting. We encouraged the public to continue to review and provide comments on the ICD-10 MS-DRGs so that CMS could continue to update the system., 295804=Section 3133 of the Affordable Care Act modified the Medicare disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payment methodology beginning in FY 2014. Currently, Medicare DSHs qualify for a DSH payment adjustment under a statutory formula that considers their Medicare utilization due to beneficiaries who also receive Supplemental Security Income benefits and their Medicaid utilization. Under section 1886(r) of the Act, which was added by section 3133 of the Affordable Care Act, starting in FY 2014, DSHs will receive 25 percent of the amount they previously would have received under the current statutory formula for Medicare DSH payments. The remaining amount, equal to 75 percent of what otherwise would have been paid as Medicare DSH payments, will be paid as additional payments after the amount is reduced for changes in the percentage of individuals that are uninsured. Each Medicare DSH will receive its additional amount based on its share of the total amount of uncompensated care for all Medicare DSH hospitals for a given time period. In this proposed rule, we are proposing to implement these statutory changes., 946462=We also are proposing to rebase the labor-related share to reflect the more recent base year. The current labor-related share, which is based on the FY 2006-based IPPS market basket, is 68.8 percent. We are proposing a labor-related share of 69.6 percent, which is based on the proposed rebased and revised FY 2010-based IPPS market basket. For a complete discussion on the rebasing of the market basket and labor-related share, we refer readers to section IV. of the preamble of this proposed rule., 300551=In this proposed rule, we are proposing to make several changes to: (1) The measure set, including the removal of some measures, the refinement of some measures, and the adoption of several new measures; (2) the administrative processes; and (3) the validation methodologies. We also are proposing to allow hospitals the option of reporting the measures in four measure sets electronically for the FY 2016 payment determination. These proposed changes would improve the timeliness and efficiency of the Hospital IQR Program and begin the process of incorporating electronic reporting into the Hospital IQR Program., 286472=While our actuaries estimate that a \u22129.3 percent adjustment to the standardized amount would be necessary if CMS were to fully recover the $11 billion recoupment required by section 631 of the ATRA in FY 2014, it is often our practice to delay or phase in rate adjustments over more than one year, in order to moderate the effects on rates in any one year. Therefore, consistent with the policies that we have adopted in many similar cases, we are proposing a \u22120.8 percent recoupment adjustment to the standardized amount in FY 2014. Although we are not proposing an additional prospective adjustment in FY 2014 for the cumulative MS-DRG documentation and coding effects through FY 2010, we are soliciting public comments as to whether any portion of the proposed \u22120.8 percent recoupment adjustment to the operating IPPS standardized amount should be reduced and instead applied as a prospective adjustment to the operating IPPS standardized amount (and hospital-specific rates) for the cumulative MS-DRG documentation and coding effect through FY 2010., 1003844=Specifically, as provided by section 3133 of the Affordable Care Act, section 1886(r) of the Act requires that, for \u201cfiscal year 2014 and each subsequent fiscal year,\u201d a \u201csubsection (d) hospital\u201d that would otherwise receive a \u201cdisproportionate share hospital payment . . . made under subsection (d)(5)(F)\u201d will receive two separately calculated payments. Specifically, section 1886(r)(1) of the Act provides that the Secretary shall pay to such a subsection (d) hospital (including a Pickle hospital) 25 percent of the amount the hospital would have received under section 1886(d)(5)(F) of the Act for disproportionate share payments, which represents \u201cthe empirically justified amount for such payment, as determined by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission in its March 2007 Report to the Congress.\u201d We refer to this payment as the \u201cempirically justified Medicare DSH payment.\u201d, 907492=Using the proposed cost category weights that we determined in section IV.B.1. of the preamble of this proposed rule, we calculated a proposed labor-related share of 69.587 percent, using the proposed FY 2010-based IPPS market basket. Accordingly, we are proposing to implement a labor-related share of 69.6 percent for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2013. We note that section 403 of Public Law 108-173 amended sections 1886(d)(3)(E) and 1886(d)(9)(C)(iv) of the Act to provide that the Secretary must employ 62 percent as the labor-related share unless 62 percent \u201cwould result in lower payments to a hospital than would otherwise be made.\u201d, 434487=On September 30, 2009, a contract was awarded to RTI to evaluate the impact of the Hospital-Acquired Condition-Present on Admission (HAC-POA) provisions on the changes in the incidence of selected conditions, effects on Medicare payments, impacts on coding accuracy, unintended consequences, and infection and event rates. This was an intra-agency project with funding and technical support from CMS, OPHS, AHRQ, and CDC. The evaluation also examined the implementation of the program and evaluated additional conditions for future selection. The contract with RTI ended on November 30, 2012. Summary reports of RTI's analysis of the FYs 2009, 2010, and 2011 MedPAR data files for the HAC-POA program evaluation were included in the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (75 FR 50085 through 50101), the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (76 FR 51512 through 51522), and the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 53292 through 53302). Summary and detailed data also were made publicly available on the CMS Web site at: http://www.cms.gov/HospitalAcqCond/01_Overview.asp and the RTI Web site at: http://www.rti.org/reports/cms/., 974520=In the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (75 FR 50238 through 50275 and 50414), we revised the regulations at 42 CFR 412.101 to reflect the changes to the qualifying criteria and the payment adjustment for low-volume hospitals made by sections 3125 and 10314 of the Affordable Care Act. In addition, we defined, at \u00a7 412.101(a), the term \u201croad miles\u201d to mean \u201cmiles\u201d as defined at \u00a7 412.92(c)(1), and clarified the existing regulations to indicate that a hospital must continue to qualify as a low-volume hospital in order to receive the payment adjustment in that year (that is, it is not based on a one-time qualification). Furthermore, in that same final rule, we discussed the process for requesting and obtaining the low-volume hospital payment adjustment for FY 2011 (75 FR 50240). For the second year of the changes to the low-volume hospital payment adjustment provided for by section 3125 and 10314 of the Affordable Care Act (that is, FY 2012), consistent with the regulations at \u00a7 412.101(b)(2)(ii), in the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (76 FR 51677 through 51680), we updated the discharge data source used to identify qualifying low-volume hospitals and calculate the payment adjustment (percentage increase). Under \u00a7 412.101(b)(2)(ii), for FYs 2011 and 2012, a hospital's Medicare discharges from the most recently available MedPAR data, as determined by CMS, are used to determine if the hospital meets the discharge criteria to receive the low-volume hospital payment adjustment in the current year. In that same final rule, we established that, for FY 2012, qualifying low-volume hospitals and their payment adjustment are determined using Medicare discharge data from the March 2011 update of the FY 2010 MedPAR file, as these data were the most recent data available at that time. In addition, we noted that eligibility for the low-volume hospital payment adjustment for FY 2012 was also dependent upon meeting (if the hospital was qualifying for the low-volume hospital payment adjustment for the first time in FY 2012), or continuing to meet (if the hospital qualified in FY 2011), the mileage criterion specified at \u00a7 412.101(b)(2)(ii). Furthermore, we established a procedure for a hospital to request low-volume hospital status for FY 2012 (which was consistent with the process we employed for the low-volume hospital payment adjustment for FY 2011)., 430691=At the March 5, 2012 and the September 19, 2012 meetings of the ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee, an announcement was made with regard to the availability of the ICD-9-CM HAC list translation to ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS code sets. Participants were informed that the list of the current ICD-9-CM selected HACs has been translated into codes using the ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS classification system. It was recommended that the public review this list of ICD-10-CM/ICD-10-PCS code translations of the current selected HACs available on the CMS Web site at: http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/ICD-10-MS-DRG-Conversion-Project.html. The translations can be found under the link titled \u201cICD-10-CM/PCS MS-DRG v30 Definitions Manual Table of Contents\u2014Full Titles\u2014HTML Version in Appendix I\u2014Hospital Acquired Conditions (HACs).\u201d The above CMS Web site regarding the ICD-10-MS-DRG Conversion Project is also available on the CMS Web site at: http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HospitalAcqCond/icd10_hacs.html. We encourage the public to submit comments on these translations through the HACs Web page using the CMS ICD-10-CM/PCS HAC Translation Feedback Mailbox that has been set up for this purpose under the Related Links section titled \u201cCMS HAC Feedback.\u201d The final HAC list translation from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM/ICD-10-PCS will be subject to formal rulemaking., 868435=The BEA Benchmark I-O data are generally scheduled for publication every 5 years. The most recent data available are for 2002. BEA also produces Annual I-O estimates; however, the 2002 Benchmark I-O data represent a much more comprehensive and detailed set of data that are derived from the 2002 Economic Census. In the FY 2010 IPPS/RY 2010 LTCH PPS final rule (74 FR 43845), we used the 2002 Benchmark I-O data (aged to FY 2006) for the FY 2006-based IPPS market basket, to be effective for FY 2010. Because BEA has not yet released new Benchmark I-O data, and we believe the data to be comprehensive and complete as indicated above, we are currently proposing to use the 2002 Benchmark I-O data in the FY 2010-based IPPS market basket., 578063=In developing the proposed FY 2014 system of weights, we used two data sources: claims data and cost report data. As in previous years, the claims data source is the MedPAR file. This file is based on fully coded diagnostic and procedure data for all Medicare inpatient hospital bills. The FY 2012 MedPAR data used in this proposed rule include discharges occurring on October 1, 2011, through September 30, 2012, based on bills received by CMS through December 31, 2012, from all hospitals subject to the IPPS and short-term, acute care hospitals in Maryland (which are under a waiver from the IPPS under section 1814(b)(3) of the Act). The FY 2012 MedPAR file used in calculating the proposed relative weights includes data for approximately 10,364,125 Medicare discharges from IPPS providers. Discharges for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a Medicare Advantage managed care plan are excluded from this analysis. These discharges are excluded when the MedPAR \u201cGHO Paid\u201d indicator field on the claim record is equal to \u201c1\u201d or when the MedPAR DRG payment field, which represents the total payment for the claim, is equal to the MedPAR \u201cIndirect Medical Education (IME)\u201d payment field, indicating that the claim was an \u201cIME only\u201d claim submitted by a teaching hospital on behalf of a beneficiary enrolled in a Medicare Advantage managed care plan. In addition, the December 31, 2012 update of the FY 2012 MedPAR file complies with version 5010 of the X12 HIPAA Transaction and Code Set Standards, and includes a variable called \u201cclaim type.\u201d Claim type \u201c60\u201d indicates that the claim was an inpatient claim paid as fee-for-service. Claim types \u201c61,\u201d \u201c62,\u201d \u201c63,\u201d and \u201c64\u201d relate to encounter claims, Medicare Advantage IME claims, and HMO no-pay claims. Therefore, the calculation of the proposed relative weights for FY 2014 also excludes claims with claim type values not equal to \u201c60.\u201d The data exclude CAHs, including hospitals that subsequently became CAHs after the period from which the data were taken. The second data source used in the cost-based relative weighting methodology is the Medicare cost report data files from the HCRIS. Normally, we use the HCRIS dataset that is 3 years prior to the IPPS fiscal year. Specifically, we used cost report data from the December 31, 2012 update of the FY 2011 HCRIS for calculating the proposed FY 2014 cost-based relative weights., 962716=Section 412.96(c)(2)(i) provides that CMS set forth the national and regional numbers of discharges in each year's annual notice of prospective payment rates for purposes of determining RRC status. As specified in section 1886(d)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act, the national standard is set at 5,000 discharges. We would normally propose to update the regional standards based on discharges for urban hospitals' cost reporting periods that began during FY 2011 (that is, October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2011), which would normally be the latest cost report data available at the time of the development of this proposed rule. However, due to a transition in our data system, in lieu of a full year of FY 2011 cost report data, we are proposing to use a combination of FY 2010 and FY 2011 cost report data in order to create a full fiscal year of cost report data for this analysis. Due to CMS' transition to a new cost reporting form effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after May 1, 2010, some FY 2011 cost reports were not yet in our system for analysis at the time of the development of this proposed rule. Therefore, in order to have a complete fiscal year of cost report data, we utilized FY 2011 cost report data if available, and for those providers whose FY 2011 cost report data was not yet in our system, we utilized their FY 2010 cost report data. This is similar to the process we used to establish the median number of discharges for urban hospitals in the census region for FY 2013, where we utilized FY 2009 and 2010 cost report data (77 FR 53406)., 537062=There are no new, revised, or deleted diagnosis codes for FY 2014. Therefore, there are no Tables 6A, 6C, and 6E published for FY 2014., 928864=For interest vintage weights, the nominal annual capital purchase amounts for total equipment (building and fixed, and movable) were used to capture the value of the debt instrument. Because we have determined that hospital debt instruments have an expected life of 26 years, the vintage weights for interest are deemed to represent the average purchase pattern of total equipment over 26-year periods. With nominal total equipment purchase estimates available back to 1963, twenty-two 26-year periods were averaged to determine the average vintage weights for interest that are representative of average capital purchase patterns over time. Vintage weights for each 26-year period are calculated by dividing the nominal total capital purchase amount for any given year by the total amount of purchases in the 26-year period. This calculation is done for each year in the 26-year period and for each of the twenty-two 26-year periods. We used the average of each year across the twenty-two 26-year periods to determine the average interest vintage weights for the proposed FY 2010-based CIPI., 248106=d. Proposed Market Basket Under the LTCH PPS for FY 2014, 912294=Under the broad authority in sections 1886(b)(3)(A) and (B), 1886(b)(3)(E), and 1871 of the Act and section 4454 of the BBA, consistent with our use of the IPPS operating market basket percentage increase to update target amounts, we are proposing to use the FY 2010-based IPPS operating market basket percentage increase to update the target amounts for children's hospitals, 11 PPS-excluded cancer hospitals, and RNHCIs that are paid on the basis of reasonable cost subject to the rate-of-increase limits under \u00a7 413.40., 702542=NeuroPace, Inc. submitted an application for new technology add-on payments for FY 2014 for the use of the RNS\u00ae System. Seizures occur when brain function is disrupted by abnormal electrical activity. Epilepsy is a brain disorder characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures. According to the applicant, the RNS\u00ae System is the first implantable medical device (developed by NeuroPace, Inc.) for treating persons with epilepsy whose partial onset seizures have not been adequately controlled with antiepileptic medications. The applicant further stated that the RNS\u00ae System is the first closed loop, responsive system to treat partial onset seizures. Responsive electrical stimulation is delivered directly to the seizure focus in the brain when abnormal brain activity is detected. A cranially implanted programmable neurostimulator senses and records brain activity through one or two electrode-containing leads that are placed at the patient's seizure focus/foci. The neurostimulator detects electrographic patterns previously identified by the physician as abnormal, and then provides brief pulses of electrical stimulation through the leads to interrupt those patterns. Stimulation is delivered only when abnormal electrocorticographic activity is detected. The typical patient is treated with a total of 5 minutes of stimulation a day. The RNS\u00ae incorporates remote monitoring, which allows patients to share information with their physicians remotely., 233478=b. Affordable Care Act Provisions for FYs 2011 and 2012, 980050=In the FY 2013 IPPS notice (78 FR 14689 through 14694), to implement the extension of the temporary change in the low-volume hospital payment adjustment policy for FY 2013 provided for by the ATRA, we updated the discharge data source used to identify qualifying low-volume hospitals and calculate the payment adjustment (percentage increase). Consistent with our implementation of the low-volume hospital payment adjustment policy for FYs 2011 and 2012 as set forth at existing \u00a7 412.101(b)(2)(ii), we established that, for FY 2013, qualifying low-volume hospitals and their payment adjustments are determined using Medicare discharge data from the March 2012 update of the FY 2011 MedPAR file, as these data were the most recent data available at the time of the development of the FY 2013 payment rates and factors established in the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule. In addition, we noted that eligibility for the low-volume hospital payment adjustment for FY 2013 is also dependent upon meeting (in the case of a hospital that did not qualify for the low-volume hospital payment adjustment in FY 2012), or continuing to meet (in the case of a hospital that did qualify for the low-volume hospital payment adjustment in FY 2012), the mileage criterion specified at existing \u00a7 412.101(b)(2)(ii). We also established a procedure for a hospital to request low-volume hospital status for FY 2013 (which is consistent with the process for the low-volume hospital payment adjustment for FYs 2011 and 2012). Furthermore, we noted our intent to make conforming changes to the regulations text at \u00a7 412.101 to reflect the changes to the qualifying criteria and the payment adjustment for low-volume hospitals in accordance with the amendments made by section 605 of the ATRA in future rulemaking. (We refer readers to the FY 2013 IPPS notice (78 FR 14689 through 14694) for additional information on the extension of the Affordable Care Act amendments to the low-volume hospital payment adjustment requirements under section 1886(d)(12) of the Act through FY 2013 in accordance with section 605 of the ATRA.), 389814=As we implemented cost-based relative weights, some public commenters raised concerns about potential bias in the weights due to \u201ccharge compression,\u201d which is the practice of applying a higher percentage charge markup over costs to lower cost items and services, and a lower percentage charge markup over costs to higher cost items and services. As a result, the cost-based weights would undervalue high-cost items and overvalue low-cost items if a single CCR is applied to items of widely varying costs in the same cost center. To address this concern, in August 2006, we awarded a contract to the Research Triangle Institute, International (RTI) to study the effects of charge compression in calculating the relative weights and to consider methods to reduce the variation in the cost-to-charge ratios (CCRs) across services within cost centers. For a detailed summary of RTI's findings, recommendations, and public comments that we received on the report, we refer readers to the FY 2009 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (73 FR 48452 through 48453). In addition, we refer readers to RTI's July 2008 final report titled \u201cRefining Cost to Charge Ratios for Calculating APC and MS-DRG Relative Payment Weights\u201d (http://www.rti.org/reports/cms/HHSM-500-2005-0029I/PDF/Refining_Cost_to_Charge_Ratios_200807_Final.pdf)., 449118=Our data analysis included MS-DRGs 064, 065, and 066 because claims involving diagnosis code V45.88 also would be properly reported in the data for these MS-DRGs. The following table reflects the results of our analysis of the MedPAR data in which diagnosis code V45.88 was reported as a secondary diagnosis for FY 2012., 260680=d. Proposed Timeline for Data Submission for the NQF #0680 Percent of Residents or Patients Who Were Assessed and Appropriately Given the Seasonal Influenza Vaccine (Short Stay) Measure for the FY 2016 Payment Determination and Subsequent Payment Determinations, 977283=Section 605 of the ATRA amended sections 1886(d)(12)(B), (C)(i), and (D) of the Act to extend, for FY 2013, the temporary changes in the low-volume hospital payment adjustment policy provided for in FYs 2011 and 2012 by the Affordable Care Act. As we have noted previously, prior to the enactment of section 605 of the ATRA, beginning with FY 2013, the low-volume hospital definition and payment adjustment methodology would have reverted to the policy established under statutory requirements that were in effect prior to the amendments made by the Affordable Care Act., 53069=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 22, 2015, 548965=The Committee held its 2013 meeting on March 5, 2013. Any new codes for which there was consensus of public support and for which complete tabular and indexing changes will be made by May 2013 will be included in the October 1, 2013 update to ICD-9-CM. Any code revisions that were discussed at the March 5, 2013 Committee meeting but that could not be finalized in time to include them in the tables listed in section VI. of the Addendum to this proposed rule will be included in Table 6B, which is listed in section VI. of the Addendum to the final rule and available via the Internet on the CMS Web site, and will be marked with an asterisk (*)., 244429=D. Proposed Annual Update for FY 2014, 517033=In the May 19, 1987 proposed notice (52 FR 18877) and the September 1, 1987 final notice (52 FR 33154), we explained that the excluded secondary diagnoses were established using the following five principles:, 259722=c. Proposed New LTCHQR Program Quality Measure for the FY 2018 Payment Determination and Subsequent Payment Determinations, 896843=The labor-related share is used to determine the proportion of the national PPS base payment rate to which the area wage index is applied. We include a cost category in the labor-related share if the costs are labor intensive and vary with the local labor market. Because of this approach, we are proposing to include in the labor-related share the national average proportion of operating costs that are attributable to wages and salaries, employee benefits, contract labor, the labor-related portion of professional fees, administrative and facilities support services, and all other: labor-related services, as we did in the FY 2010 IPPS/RY 2010 LTCH PPS final rule (74 FR 43850). Consistent with previous rebasings, the \u201call other: labor-related services\u201d cost category is mostly comprised of building maintenance and security services (including, but not limited to, commercial and industrial machinery and equipment repair, nonresidential maintenance and repair, and investigation and security services). Because these services tend to be labor-intensive and are mostly performed at the hospital facility (and, therefore, unlikely to be purchased in the national market), we believe that they meet our definition of labor-related services., 358395=On September 29, 2007, Congress enacted the TMA [Transitional Medical Assistance], Abstinence Education, and QI [Qualifying Individuals] Programs Extension Act of 2007, Public Law 110-90. Section 7(a) of Public Law 110-90 reduced the documentation and coding adjustment made as a result of the MS-DRG system that we adopted in the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment period to \u22120.6 percent for FY 2008 and \u22120.9 percent for FY 2009, and we finalized the FY 2008 adjustment through rulemaking, effective October 1, 2007 (72 FR 66886)., 261658=12. Proposed LTCHQR Program Reconsideration and Appeals for the FY 2015 Payment Determination and Subsequent Payment Determinations, 357298=In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment period (72 FR 47175 through 47186), we indicated that the adoption of the MS-DRGs had the potential to lead to increases in aggregate payments without a corresponding increase in actual patient severity of illness due to the incentives for additional documentation and coding. In that final rule with comment period, we exercised our authority under section 1886(d)(3)(A)(vi) of the Act, which authorizes us to maintain budget neutrality by adjusting the national standardized amount, to eliminate the estimated effect of changes in coding or classification that do not reflect real changes in case-mix. Our actuaries estimated that maintaining budget neutrality required an adjustment of \u22124.8 percent to the national standardized amount. We provided for phasing in this \u22124.8 percent adjustment over 3 years. Specifically, we established prospective documentation and coding adjustments of \u22121.2 percent for FY 2008, \u22121.8 percent for FY 2009, and \u22121.8 percent for FY 2010., 989541=Under the IPPS, an additional payment amount is made to hospitals that have residents in an approved graduate medical education (GME) program in order to reflect the higher indirect patient care costs of teaching hospitals relative to nonteaching hospitals. The payment amount is determined by use of a statutorily specified adjustment factor. The regulations regarding the calculation of this additional payment, known as the IME adjustment, are located at \u00a7 412.105. We refer readers to the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (76 FR 51680) for a full discussion of the IME adjustment and IME adjustment factor. Section 1886(d)(5)(B) of the Act states that, for discharges occurring during FY 2008 and fiscal years thereafter, the IME formula multiplier is 1.35. Accordingly, for discharges occurring during FY 2014, the formula multiplier is 1.35. We estimate that application of this formula multiplier for the FY 2014 IME adjustment will result in an increase in IPPS payment of 5.5 percent for every approximately 10 percent increase in the hospital's resident to bed ratio., 229125=1. Development of Data for the Proposed FY 2014 Occupational Mix Adjustment Based on the 2010 Occupational Mix Survey, 251110=5. Proposed Changes to Hospital IQR Program Measures Previously Adopted for the FY 2015 and FY 2016 Payment Determinations and Subsequent Years, 247212=C. Proposed LTCH PPS Payment Rates for FY 2014, 355881=For information on the adoption of the MS-DRGs in FY 2008, we refer readers to the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment period (72 FR 47140 through 47189)., 230692=b. Applications for Reclassifications for FY 2015, 871623=As stated previously, for the proposed FY 2010-based market basket we are proposing to use data from the Medicare cost reports to derive seven major cost categories. We are proposing the same detailed cost categories as the FY 2006-based IPPS market basket. Also, we are not proposing to change our definition of the labor-related share. As discussed in more detail below and similar to the previous rebasing, we classify a cost category as labor-related and include it in the labor-related share if the cost category is defined as being labor-intensive and its cost varies with the local labor market., 198887=BBABalanced Budget Act of 1997, Public Law 105-33, 419964=Effective for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2008, pursuant to the authority of section 1886(d)(4)(D) of the Act, Medicare no longer assigns an inpatient hospital discharge to a higher paying MS-DRG if a selected condition is not present on admission (POA). Thus, if a selected condition that was not POA manifests during the hospital stay, it is considered a HAC and the case is paid as though the secondary diagnosis was not present. However, even if a HAC manifests during the hospital stay, if any nonselected CC/MCC appears on the claim, the claim will be paid at the higher MS-DRG rate. In addition, Medicare continues to assign a discharge to a higher paying MS-DRG if a selected condition is POA. When a HAC is not POA, payment can be affected in a manner shown in the diagram below., 800178=Because the occupational mix adjustment is required by statute, all hospitals that are subject to payments under the IPPS, or any hospital that would be subject to the IPPS if not granted a waiver, must complete the occupational mix survey, unless the hospital has no associated cost report wage data that are included in the proposed FY 2014 wage index. For the FY 2010 survey, the response rate was 91.7 percent. In the proposed FY 2014 wage index established in this proposed rule, we applied proxy data for noncompliant hospitals, new hospitals, or hospitals that submitted erroneous or aberrant data in the same manner that we applied proxy data for such hospitals in the FY 2012 wage index occupational mix adjustment (76 FR 51586)., 969601=Section 1886(d)(12) of the Act, as added by section 406(a) of Public Law 108-173, provides for a payment adjustment to account for the higher costs per discharge for low-volume hospitals under the IPPS, effective beginning FY 2005. The additional payment adjustment to a low-volume hospital provided for under section 1886(d)(12) of the Act is \u201c[i]n addition to any payment calculated under this section.\u201d Therefore, the additional payment adjustment is based on the per discharge amount paid to the qualifying hospital under section 1886 of the Act. In other words, the low-volume hospital payment adjustment is based on total per discharge payments made under section 1886 of the Act, including capital, DSH, IME, and outlier payments. For SCHs and MDHs, the low-volume hospital payment adjustment is based in part on either the Federal rate or the hospital-specific rate, whichever results in a greater operating IPPS payment., 263779=e. Proposed Population, Sampling, and Minimum Case Threshold for the FY 2016 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years, 226212=H. Recalibration of Proposed FY 2014 MS-DRG Relative Weights, 783987=Consistent with the wage index methodology for FY 2013, the proposed wage index for FY 2014 also excludes the direct and overhead salaries and hours for services not subject to IPPS payment, such as SNF services, home health services, costs related to GME (teaching physicians and residents) and certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), and other subprovider components that are not paid under the IPPS. The proposed FY 2014 wage index also excludes the salaries, hours, and wage-related costs of hospital-based rural health clinics (RHCs), and Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) because Medicare pays for these costs outside of the IPPS (68 FR 45395). In addition, salaries, hours, and wage-related costs of CAHs are excluded from the wage index, for the reasons explained in the FY 2004 IPPS final rule (68 FR 45397 through 45398)., 254860=11. Proposed Data Accuracy and Completeness Acknowledgement Requirements for the FY 2015 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years, 185077=Comment Period: To be assured consideration, comments must be received at one of the addresses provided below, no later than 5 p.m. EDT on June 25, 2013., 543458=We identify those procedures occurring in conjunction with certain principal diagnoses with sufficient frequency to justify adding them to one of the surgical MS-DRGs for the MDC in which the diagnosis falls. As noted above, there were no cases that merited movement or that should logically be assigned to any of the other MDCs. Therefore, for FY 2014, we are not proposing to remove any procedures from MS-DRGs 981 through 983 or MS-DRGs 987 through 989 into one of the surgical MS-DRGs for the MDC into which the principal diagnosis is assigned., 271384=5. Effects of Changes Under the FY 2014 Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program, 268103=B. Calculation of the Proposed Inpatient Capital-Related Prospective Payments for FY 2014, 514065=In this proposed rule, we are proposing limited changes to the MS-DRG classifications for FY 2014, as discussed in sections II.G.2. and 5. of this preamble. In our review of these proposed changes, we did not identify any needed changes to the surgical hierarchy. Therefore, in this proposed rule, we are not proposing any changes to the surgical hierarchy for Pre-MDCs and MDCs for FY 2014., 802109=As discussed in section III.F. of this preamble, for FY 2014, we are proposing to apply the proposed occupational mix adjustment to 100 percent of the proposed FY 2014 wage index. We calculated the proposed occupational mix adjustment using data from the 2010 occupational mix survey data, using the methodology described in the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (76 FR 51582 through 51586)., 545605=Based on the review of cases in the MDCs as described above in sections II.G.1. through 6. of this preamble, we are not proposing to add any diagnosis or procedure codes to MDCs for FY 2014., 209721=MMEAMedicare and Medicaid Extenders Act of 2010, Public Law 111-309, 855135=Effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1979, we developed and adopted a hospital input price index (that is, the hospital market basket for operating costs). Although \u201cmarket basket\u201d technically describes the mix of goods and services used in providing hospital care, this term is also commonly used to denote the input price index (that is, cost category weights and price proxies combined) derived from that market basket. Accordingly, the term \u201cmarket basket\u201d as used in this document refers to the hospital input price index., 194620=In the past, a majority of the tables referred to throughout this preamble and in the Addendum to this proposed rule and the final rule were published in the Federal Register as part of the annual proposed and final rules. However, beginning in FY 2012, some of the IPPS tables and LTCH PPS tables are no longer published in the Federal Register. Instead, these tables will be available only through the Internet. The IPPS tables for this proposed rule are available only through the Internet on the CMS Web site at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/Medicare/medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/index.html. Click on the link on the left side of the screen titled, \u201cFY 2014 IPPS Proposed Rule Home Page\u201d or \u201cAcute Inpatient\u2014Files for Download\u201d. The LTCH PPS tables for this FY 2014 proposed rule are available only through the Internet on the CMS Web site at: http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/LongTermCareHospitalPPS/index.html under the list item for Regulation Number CMS-1599-P. For complete details on the availability of the tables referenced in this proposed rule, we refer readers to section VI. of the Addendum to this proposed rule., 789018=For the proposed FY 2014 wage index, we allotted the wages and hours data for a multicampus hospital among the different labor market areas where its campuses are located in the same manner that we allotted such hospitals' data in the FY 2013 wage index (77 FR 53366). Table 2 containing the proposed FY 2014 wage index associated with this proposed rule (available on the CMS Web site) includes separate wage data for the campuses of six multicampus hospitals (two additional multicampus hospitals have been added to the wage index calculation for FY 2014)., 884667=As stated above, we are proposing to use the same price proxies used in the FY 2006-based IPPS market basket. A rationale for selecting these price proxies can be found in the FY 2010 IPPS/RY 2010 LTCH PPS final rule (74 FR 43845). The price proxies we are proposing were selected to most closely match the costs included in each of the cost categories of the proposed FY 2010-based IPPS market basket. As discussed above, we are proposing that, if the 2007 Benchmark I-O data become available between the proposed and final rule with sufficient time to incorporate such data into the final rule, we would incorporate this data into the FY 2010-based IPPS market basket for the final rule. As a result, to the extent the incorporation of the 2007 Benchmark I-O data results in a different composition of costs included in a particular cost category, we are proposing that we may choose to revise that specific price proxy to ensure that the costs included in each detailed cost category are best aligned with the associated price proxy. Below is a list of the price proxies we are proposing for the FY 2010-based IPPS market basket., 292244=In this proposed rule, we are outlining payment details for the FY 2014 Hospital VBP Program. In addition, we are proposing numerous policies for the FY 2016 Hospital VBP Program, including measures, performance standards, and performance and baseline periods. We also are proposing a disaster/extraordinary circumstances waiver process, domain reclassification and weighting based on CMS' National Quality Strategy for the FY 2017 Hospital VBP Program, and certain measures, performance and baseline periods, and performance standards for the FY 2017 through FY 2019 Programs., 76422=3 actions from May 10th, 2013 to August 2013, 448192=For this proposed rule, we analyzed MedPAR claims data from FY 2012. We included claims for patient cases assigned to the following MS-DRGs:, 807735=Section 4410(a) of Public Law 105-33 provides that, for discharges on or after October 1, 1997, the area wage index applicable to any hospital that is located in an urban area of a State may not be less than the area wage index applicable to hospitals located in rural areas in that State. This provision is referred to as the \u201crural floor.\u201d Section 3141 of Public Law 111-148 also requires that a national budget neutrality adjustment be applied in implementing the rural floor. In the proposed FY 2014 wage index associated with this proposed rule and available on the CMS Web site, we estimated that 434 hospitals would receive an increase in their FY 2014 proposed wage index due to the application of the rural floor., 238368=d. Proposed Efficiency Domain Measure Performance Period and Baseline Period for the FY 2016 Hospital VBP Program, 221878=2. Discussion and Proposal for FY 2014, 347232=In section VI. of the preamble to this proposed rule, we discuss the proposed payment policy requirements for capital-related costs and capital payments to hospitals for FY 2014 and other related proposed policy changes., 423358=Collection of POA indicator data is necessary to identify which conditions were acquired during hospitalization for the HAC payment provision as well as for broader public health uses of Medicare data. In previous rulemaking, we provided both CMS and CDC Web site resources that are available to hospitals for assistance in this reporting effort. For detailed information regarding these sites and materials, including the application and use of POA indicators, we refer the reader to the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (76 FR 51506 through 51507)., 233580=2. Provisions of the ATRA for FY 2013, 274754=II. Inpatient Hospital Update for FY 2014, 794481=Using the data as described above and in the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule, the proposed FY 2014 national average hourly wage (unadjusted for occupational mix) is $38.2384. The proposed FY 2014 Puerto Rico overall average hourly wage (unadjusted for occupational mix) is $16.4873., 542230=Our review of MedPAR claims data showed that there were no cases that merited movement or should logically be assigned to any of the other MDCs. Therefore, for FY 2014, we are not proposing to change the procedures assigned among these MS-DRGs., 509403=We are inviting public comments on our proposal to add the above listed new discharge status codes to the GROUPER and the MCE logic effective October 1, 2013 (FY 2014)., 833611=In a memorandum dated October 19, 2012, we instructed all fiscal intermediaries/MACs to inform the IPPS hospitals they service of the availability of the wage index data files and the process and timeframe for requesting revisions (including the specific deadlines listed below). We also instructed the fiscal intermediaries/MACs to advise hospitals that these data were also made available directly through their representative hospital organizations., 660426=After evaluation of the newness, costs, and substantial clinical improvement criteria for new technology add-on payments for the Zenith\u00ae F. Graft and consideration of the public comments we received in response to the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule, we approved the Zenith\u00ae F. Graft for new technology add-on payments for FY 2013. Cases involving the Zenith\u00ae F. Graft that are eligible for new technology add-on payments are identified by ICD-9-CM procedure code 39.78 (Endovascular implantation of branching or fenestrated graft(s) in aorta). In the application, the applicant provided a breakdown of the costs of the Zenith\u00ae F. Graft. The total cost of the Zenith\u00ae F. Graft utilizing bare metal (renal) alignment stents was $17,264. Of the $17,264 in costs for the Zenith\u00ae F. Graft, $921 are for components that are used in a standard Zenith AAA Endovascular Graft procedure. Because the costs for these components are already reflected within the MS-DRGs (and are no longer \u201cnew\u201d), in the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule, we stated that we do not believe it is appropriate to include these costs in our calculation of the maximum cost to determine the maximum add-on payment for the Zenith\u00ae F. Graft. Therefore, the total maximum cost for the Zenith\u00ae F. Graft is $16,343 ($17,264 \u2212 $921). Under \u00a7 412.88(a)(2), new technology add-on payments are limited to the lesser of 50 percent of the average cost of the device or 50 percent of the costs in excess of the MS-DRG payment for the case. As a result, the maximum add-on payment for a case involving the Zenith\u00ae F. Graft is $8,171.50., 797739=On December 7, 2012, we published in the Federal Register a notice soliciting comments on the proposed 2013 Medicare Wage Index Occupational Mix Survey (77 FR 73032 through 73033). The new 2013 survey includes the same data elements and definitions as the 2010 survey and provides for the collection of hospital-specific wages and hours data for nursing employees for calendar year 2013 (that is, payroll periods ending between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013). The comment period for the notice ended on February 5, 2013. After considering the public comments that we received on the December 2012 notice, we made a few minor editorial changes and published the 2013 survey in the Federal Register on February 28, 2013 (78 FR 13679). This survey is pending OMB review, and is available on the CMS Web site at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/PaperworkReductionActof1995 by clicking on \u201cPRA Listings.\u201d (The OMB control number for this collection of information is 0938-0907.) Hospitals are required to submit their completed 2013 surveys to their fiscal intermediaries/MACs by July 1, 2014. The preliminary, unaudited 2013 survey data will be released afterward, along with the FY 2012 Worksheet S-3 wage data, for the FY 2016 wage index review and correction process., 635555=As we indicated in the FY 2009 IPPS final rule (73 FR 48554), we invite any product developers or manufacturers of new medical technologies to contact the agency early in the process of product development if they have questions or concerns about the evidence that would be needed later in the development process for the agency's coverage decisions for Medicare., 189748=Michele Hudson, (410) 786-4487, and Judith Richter, (410) 786-2590, Long-Term Care Hospital Prospective Payment System and MS-LTC-DRG Relative Weights Issues., 53768=On June 2, 2015, the Office of the Federal Register (OFR) hosted its 3rd Annual Federal Register Liaison Conference in the National Archives\u2019 McGowan Theater.

Beginning in 1993, certain patients could obtain expanded access for treatment use to Voraxaze\u00ae as an investigational drug. Since 2007, the applicant has been authorized to recover the costs of making Voraxaze\u00ae available through its expanded access program. We describe expanded access for treatment use of investigational drugs and authorization to recover certain costs of investigational drugs in the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 53346 through 53350). Voraxaze\u00ae was available on the market in the United States as a commercial product to the larger population as of April 30, 2012. In the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule (77 FR 27936 through 27939), we expressed concerns about whether Voraxaze\u00ae could be considered new for FY 2013. After consideration of all of the public comments received, in the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule, we stated that we considered Voraxaze\u00ae to be \u201cnew\u201d as of April 30, 2012, which is the date of market availability., 238528=e. Proposed Outcome Domain Performance Periods and Baseline Periods for the FY 2017 through FY 2019 Hospital VBP Programs, 640453=Approximately 60 individuals registered to attend the town hall meeting in person, while additional individuals listened over an open telephone line. We also live-streamed the town hall meeting over the Internet and received very positive feedback from the public on use of this option. We are considering no longer holding an in-person town hall meeting in Baltimore, MD, and instead holding a virtual town hall meeting that would be live-streamed on the Internet. We are inviting public comments on the possibility of holding a virtual town hall meeting instead of an in-person town hall meeting in Baltimore, MD. Four of the five FY 2014 applicants presented information on their technologies, including a discussion of data reflecting the substantial clinical improvement aspect of the technology. We considered each applicant's presentation made at the town hall meeting, as well as written comments submitted on the applications that were received by the due date of February 26, 2013, in our evaluation of the new technology add-on payment applications for FY 2014 in this proposed rule., 729694=Because the applicant used FY 2010 MedPAR data, it was necessary to inflate the charges from FY 2010 to FY 2013. Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index, the applicant inflated the average standardized charge per case with an inflation factor of 7 percent. To determine the amount of Zilver\u00ae PTX\u00ae stents per case, instead of using the amount of stents used per case based on the ICD-9-CM codes above, the applicant used an average of 1.9 stents per case based on the Zilver\u00ae PTX\u00ae Global Registry Clinical Study [6] . The applicant believed that it is appropriate to use data from the clinical study (to determine the average amount of stents used per case) rather than the actual data from the claims because the length of a non-drug-eluting peripheral vessel stent typically ranges from 80mm to 120 mm, while the length of the Zilver\u00ae PTX\u00ae is 80 mm (which could cause a variance in the actual amount of stents used per case when using the Zilver\u00ae PTX\u00ae). The applicant then multiplied the average of 1.9 stents used per case by the future market price for the Zilver\u00ae PTX\u00ae and then converted the cost of the stents used per claim to a charge by dividing the results by the hospital-specific CCR (from the FY 2010 IPPS impact file). The applicant then added the amount of charges related to the Zilver\u00ae PTX\u00ae to the inflated average standardized charge per case and determined a final inflated case-weighted average standardized charge per case of $58,419. Although the applicant submitted data that related to the estimated cost of the Zilver\u00ae PTX\u00ae, the applicant noted that the cost of the technology was proprietary information. Using the FY 2014 Table 10 thresholds, the case-weighted threshold for MS-DRGs 252, 253, and 254 was $54,547 (all calculations above were performed using unrounded numbers). Because the final inflated case-weighted average standardized charge per case for the applicable MS-DRGs exceeded the case-weighted threshold amount, the applicant maintained that the Zilver\u00ae PTX\u00ae would meet the cost criterion., 917068=The total Interest cost category is split between government/nonprofit interest and for-profit interest. The FY 2006-based CIPI allocated 85 percent of the total interest cost weight to government/nonprofit interest and proxied that category by the average yield on domestic municipal bonds. The remaining 15 percent of the interest cost weight was allocated to for-profit interest and was proxied by the average yield on Moody's Aaa bonds (74 FR 43857)., 239497=c. Proposed Domain Weighting for the FY 2016 Hospital VBP Program for Hospitals Receiving Scores on Fewer than Four Domains, 454661=The Spiration\u00ae IBV Valve System device, a bronchial valve, was approved for new technology add-on payments in the FY 2010 IPPS/RY 2010 LTCH PPS final rule (74 FR 43819 through 43823) with a maximum payment rate of $3,437.50. In the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule, the new technology add-on payments were discontinued for FY 2012 (76 FR 51575 through 51576). The bronchial valve device is used to place, via bronchoscopy, small, one-way valves into selected small airways in the lung in order to limit airflow into selected portions of lung tissue that have prolonged air leaks following surgery while still allowing mucus, fluids, and air to exit, and thereby reducing the amount of air that enters the pleural space. The device is intended to control prolonged air leaks following three specific surgical procedures: lobectomy, segmentectomy, or lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). According to Spiration\u00ae, an air leak that is present on postoperative day 7 is considered \u201cprolonged\u201d unless present only during forced exhalation or cough. In order to help prevent valve migration, there are five anchors with tips that secure the valve to the airway. The implanted valves are intended to be removed no later than 6 weeks after implantation., 849128=In the FY 2010 IPPS/RY 2010 LTCH PPS final rule (74 FR 43850 through 43857), we rebased and revised the IPPS market basket and the labor-related share, using FY 2006 as the base year. The labor-related share for FY 2010 through FY 2013 is 68.8 percent., 775388=Section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act requires the Secretary to update the wage index annually and to base the update on a survey of wages and wage-related costs of short-term, acute care hospitals. This provision also requires that any updates or adjustments to the wage index be made in a manner that ensures that aggregate payments to hospitals are not affected by the change in the wage index. The proposed adjustment for FY 2014 is discussed in section II.B. of the Addendum to this proposed rule., 858594=As noted above, the market basket is described as a fixed-weight index because it represents the change in price over time of a constant mix (quantity and intensity) of goods and services needed to provide hospital services. The effects on total expenditures resulting from changes in the mix of goods and services purchased subsequent to the base period are not measured. For example, a hospital hiring more nurses to accommodate the needs of patients would increase the volume of goods and services purchased by the hospital, but would not be factored into the price change measured by a fixed-weight hospital market basket. Only when the index is rebased would changes in the quantity and intensity be captured, with those changes being reflected in the cost weights. Therefore, we rebase the market basket periodically so that the cost weights reflect recent changes in the mix of goods and services that hospitals purchase (hospital inputs) to furnish inpatient care between base periods. We last rebased the hospital market basket cost weights effective for FY 2010 (74 FR 43843), with FY 2006 data used as the base period for the construction of the market basket cost weights., 895913=The differences between the FY 2006-based and the proposed FY 2010-based IPPS market basket increases are minimal. While the percent changes differ slightly, when rounded to the nearest tenth, the updates based on the FY 2006-based and the proposed FY 2010-based IPPS market baskets are the same., 360912=Section 7(b)(1)(A) of Public Law 110-90 requires that, if the Secretary determines that implementation of the MS-DRG system resulted in changes in documentation and coding that did not reflect real changes in case-mix for discharges occurring during FY 2008 or FY 2009 that are different than the prospective documentation and coding adjustments applied under section 7(a) of Public Law 110-90, the Secretary shall make an appropriate adjustment under section 1886(d)(3)(A)(vi) of the Act. Section 1886(d)(3)(A)(vi) of the Act authorizes adjustments to the average standardized amounts for subsequent fiscal years in order to eliminate the effect of such coding or classification changes. These adjustments are intended to ensure that future annual aggregate IPPS payments are the same as the payments that otherwise would have been made had the prospective adjustments for documentation and coding applied in FY 2008 and FY 2009 reflected the change that occurred in those years., 1010200=As indicated above, the new payment methodology applies to \u201csubsection (d) hospitals\u201d that would otherwise receive a \u201cdisproportionate share payment . . . made under subsection (d)(5)(F).\u201d Therefore, eligibility for empirically justified Medicare DSH payments is unchanged under this new provision. Consistent with the law, hospitals must receive empirically justified Medicare DSH payments in FY 2014 or a subsequent year to receive an additional Medicare uncompensated care payment for that year. Specifically, section 1886(r)(2) of the Act states that, \u201c[i]n addition to the payment made to a subsection (d) hospital under paragraph (1), . . . the Secretary shall pay to such subsection (d) hospital an additional amount . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Because paragraph (1) refers to empirically justified Medicare DSH payments, the additional payment under section 1886(r)(2) is, therefore, limited to hospitals that receive empirically justified Medicare DSH payments pursuant to section 1886(r)(1) of the Act for FY 2014 and subsequent years., 777309=The wage index is calculated and assigned to hospitals on the basis of the labor market area in which the hospital is located. Under section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act, beginning with FY 2005, we define hospital labor market areas based on the Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) established by OMB. The current statistical areas are based on OMB standards published on December 27, 2000 (65 FR 82228) and Census 2000 data and Census Bureau population estimates for 2007 and 2008 (OMB Bulletin No. 10-02). For a discussion of OMB's delineations of CBSAs and our implementation of the CBSA definitions, we refer readers to the preamble of the FY 2005 IPPS final rule (69 FR 49026 through 49032). We also discussed in the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (76 FR 51582) and the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 53365) that, in 2013, OMB plans to announce new area delineations based on new standards adopted in 2010 (75 FR 37246) and the 2010 Census of Population and Housing data. On February 28, 2013, OMB issued OMB Bulletin No. 13-01, which established revised delineations for Metropolitan Statistical Areas, Micropolitan Statistical Areas, and Combined Statistical Areas, and provides guidance on the use of the delineations of these statistical areas. A copy of this bulletin may be obtained at http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/bulletins/2013/b-13-01.pdf. According to OMB, \u201c[t]his bulletin provides the delineations of all Metropolitan Statistical Areas, Metropolitan Divisions, Micropolitan Statistical Areas, Combined Statistical Areas, and New England City and Town Areas in the United States and Puerto Rico based on the standards published on June 28, 2010, in the Federal Register (75 FR 37246-37252) and Census Bureau data.\u201d, 229289=2. New 2013 Occupational Mix Survey for the FY 2016 Wage Index, 832624=In the interest of meeting the data needs of the public, beginning with the proposed FY 2009 wage index, we post an additional public use file on our Web site that reflects the actual data that are used in computing the proposed wage index. The release of this new file does not alter the current wage index process or schedule. We notify the hospital community of the availability of these data as we do with the current public use wage data files through our Hospital Open Door forum. We encourage hospitals to sign up for automatic notifications of information about hospital issues and the scheduling of the Hospital Open Door forums at the CMS Web site at: http://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Outreach/OpenDoorForums/index.html., 987473=Consistent with our previously established procedure, for FY 2014, a hospital must make its request for low-volume hospital status in writing to its fiscal intermediary or MAC by September 1, 2013, in order for the 25-percent low-volume hospital payment adjustment to be applied to payments for its discharges beginning on or after October 1, 2013 (through September 30, 2014). If a hospital's request for low-volume hospital status for FY 2014 is received after September 1, 2013, and if the fiscal intermediary or MAC determines the hospital meets the criteria to qualify as a low-volume hospital, the fiscal intermediary or MAC will apply the 25-percent low-volume hospital payment adjustment to determine the payment for the hospital's FY 2014 discharges, effective prospectively within 30 days of the date of the fiscal intermediary's or MAC's low-volume hospital status determination., 220620=3. Retrospective Evaluation of FY 2008 and FY 2009 Claims Data, 401207=For comparison purposes, the following table shows the final FY 2013 CCRs, the potential FY 2014 CCRs computed with the existing 15 cost centers, and the potential FY 2014 CCRs computed with 19 cost centers, with 4 new CCRs for implantable devices, MRIs, CT scans, and cardiac catheterization., 367673=Mailing address if using express mail:Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,OFM/Division of Accounting\u2014RDDC,7500 Security Boulevard, C3-07-11,Baltimore, MD 21244-1850., 870509=Following publication of the FY 2010 IPPS/RY 2010 LTCH PPS proposed rule, and in an effort to provide greater transparency, we posted on the CMS market basket Web page at: http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/MedicareProgramRatesStats/MarketBasketResearch.html an illustrative spreadsheet that shows how the detailed cost weights in the proposed rule (that is, those not calculated using Medicare cost reports) were determined using the 2002 Benchmark I-O data. As stated above, we are proposing to use the 2007 Benchmark BEA I-O data if available before the final rule with sufficient time to incorporate such data into the final rule. We would use the same methodology as described above in determining the detailed weights in the \u201call other\u201d cost weight., 1001549=Section 3133 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), as amended by section 10316 of PPACA and section 1104 of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (Pub. L. 111-152), added a new section 1886(r) to the Act that modifies the methodology for computing the Medicare DSH payment adjustment beginning in FY 2014. For purposes of this proposed rule, we will refer to these provisions collectively as Section 3133 of the Affordable Care Act., 211792=NTTAANational Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1991 (Pub. L. 104-113), 808895=In the FY 2005 IPPS final rule (69 FR 49109 through 49111), we adopted the \u201cimputed floor\u201d policy as a temporary 3-year regulatory measure to address concerns from hospitals in all-urban States that have argued that they are disadvantaged by the absence of rural hospitals to set a wage index floor for those States. Since its initial implementation, we have extended the imputed floor policy three times, the last of which was adopted in the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule and is set to expire on September 30, 2014 (we refer readers to the discussion in the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 53368 through 53369) and to our regulations at 42 CFR 412.64(h)(4)). There are currently two all-urban States, New Jersey and Rhode Island, that have a range of wage indices assigned to hospitals in the State, including through reclassification or redesignation (we refer readers to discussions of geographic reclassifications and redesignations in section III.H. of this preamble). However, as we explain below, the method as of FY 2012 for computing the imputed floor, which we will refer to as the original methodology, benefitted only New Jersey, and not Rhode Island., 248209=e. Proposed Annual Market Basket Update for LTCHs for FY 2014, 758907=The applicant further stated that although many of the patients who are refused surgery die in the intervening months to years, the economic burden to the healthcare system of mitral regurgitation in elderly patients not deemed suitable for conventional open chest surgery is considerable. The applicant noted that the vast majority of such patients are repeatedly hospitalized, often with prolonged lengths of in-hospital stays, and, even when returned to the community, they consume additional resources from the primary care and social services. The applicant asserted that the quality of life enjoyed by these patients is also poor and their mortality rates are high. The applicant cited the 2012 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) clinical practice guideline for valvular heart disease, which recommended that the MitraClip\u00ae procedure be considered in high surgical risk patients with symptomatic severe secondary MR., 274842=A. Proposed FY 2014 Inpatient Hospital Update, 380336=Our actuaries estimate that a \u22129.3 percent adjustment to the standardized amount would be necessary if CMS were to fully recover the $11 billion recoupment required by section 631 of the ATRA in FY 2014. In its March 2013 \u201cReport to Congress: Medicare Payment Policy,\u201d MedPAC estimates that a \u22122.4 percent adjustment made in FY 2014, and not removed until FY 2018, also would recover the required recoupment amount. It is often our practice to delay or phase in rate adjustments over more than one year, in order to moderate the effect on rates in any one year. Therefore, consistent with the policies that we have adopted in many similar cases, we are proposing a \u22120.8 percent recoupment adjustment to the standardized amount in FY 2014. We estimate that this level of adjustment will recover up to $0.96 billion in FY 2014, with at least $10.04 billion remaining to be recovered by FY 2017. If adjustments of approximately \u22120.8 percent are implemented in FYs 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, using standard inflation factors, we estimate that the entire $11 billion will be accounted for by the end of the statutory 4-year timeline. As estimates of any future adjustments are subject to slight variations in total savings, we are not proposing specific adjustments for FYs 2015, 2016, or 2017 at this time. We believe that this level of adjustment for FY 2014 is a reasonable and fair approach that satisfies the requirements of the statute while mitigating extreme annual fluctuations in payment rates. We again note that this \u22120.8 percent recoupment adjustment, and future adjustments under this authority, will be eventually offset by an equivalent positive adjustment once the full $11 billion recoupment requirement has been realized., 232799=2. Proposed FY 2014 Puerto Rico Hospital Update, 386895=It is often our practice to delay or phase-in adjustments to mitigate negative financial impacts. Because we are proposing a \u22120.8 percent recoupment adjustment, as discussed in section II.D.6. of the preamble of this proposed rule, we are not proposing a prospective adjustment in FY 2014 for the cumulative MS-DRG documentation and coding effect through FY 2010. However, we are soliciting public comments as to whether any portion of the proposed \u22120.8 percent recoupment adjustment should be reduced and instead applied to a prospective adjustment for the cumulative MS-DRG documentation and coding effect through FY 2010. For example, we could apply a \u22120.25 percent recoupment adjustment, and a \u22120.55 prospective adjustment, for a total FY 2014 adjustment of \u22120.8 percent. Reducing the recoupment adjustment in FY 2014 would require relatively larger adjustments for FYs 2015, 2016, and/or 2017, but making a prospective adjustment of \u22120.55 percent would eliminate future payment increases due to MS-DRG documentation and coding that did not reflect real changes in case-mix for discharges occurring through FY 2010. As we discuss above, because the documentation and coding effect through FY 2010 was found for both IPPS hospitals paid with the standardized amount and IPPS hospitals paid under their hospital-specific payment rate, if we were to apply a prospective adjustment to remove this effect, we also would apply such an adjustment to the hospital-specific payment rate, using the Secretary's broad authority under section 1886(d)(5)(I)(i) of the Act (77 FR 53276 through 53277). Therefore, if we attribute a portion of the \u22120.8 percent adjustment for FY 2014 to the prospective adjustment, we also would make appropriate adjustments to the hospital-specific payment rates. Puerto Rico-specific rates would not be affected, as we previously found no significant additional MS-DRG documentation and coding effect for FY 2010 that would warrant any additional adjustment to the Puerto Rico-specific rate (77 FR 53279)., 709272=After inflating the charges, the applicant estimated charges for the RNS\u00ae System by multiplying the device cost to the hospital by an anticipated hospital markup of 100 percent, or conversely by dividing the device cost by a CCR of 0.50. The applicant based its estimated CCR on four analyses. First, the applicant reviewed the 2007 and 2008 reports prepared by RTI for CMS on charge compression, which found that the national aggregate CCR for devices and implants was 0.43 and 0.467 in the respective reports. Second, the applicant queried hospitals participating in the RNS\u00ae System Pivotal trial, and these queries yielded a mean and median CCR for implantable devices of 0.37 and 0.36, respectively. Third, the applicant reviewed data from the (all payor) Premier database for cases performed in 2000 through 2010 that reported ICD-9 CM procedure codes 02.93 and/or 86.95 on a claim and calculated a mean and median CCR for implanted leads and neurostimulators of 0.50 and 0.44, respectively. The applicant then reviewed other discussions of past new technology add-on payment applications published in the Federal Register and noted that other applicants used lower CCRs (higher markups) for implanted devices than the 0.50 CCR used in the applicant's analyses., 1011312=In this proposed rule, we are proposing that hospitals that are not eligible to receive empirically justified Medicare DSH payments in FY 2014 and subsequent years would not receive uncompensated care payments for those respective years. We also are proposing to make a determination concerning eligibility for interim uncompensated care payments based on each hospital's estimated DSH status for FY 2014 or the applicable year (using the most recent data that are available). Our final determination on the hospital's eligibility for uncompensated care payments would be based on the hospital's actual DSH status on the cost report for that payment year. (We discuss these proposals in more detail below.), 962000=We intend to update the preceding numbers in the FY 2014 final rule to reflect the updated FY 2012 MedPAR file, which would contain data from additional bills received through March 2013., 967662=Section 1886(d)(12) of the Act provides for an additional payment to each qualifying low-volume hospital under the IPPS beginning in FY 2005. Section 1886(d)(12) of the Act sets forth the qualifying criteria for a qualifying low-volume hospital and the methodology for determining the low-volume hospital payment adjustment., 551971=Questions and comments concerning the procedure codes should be addressed to: Patricia E. Brooks, Co-Chairperson, ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee, CMS, Center for Medicare Management, Hospital and Ambulatory Policy Group, Division of Acute Care, C4-08-06, 7500 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21244-1850. Comments may be sent by Email to: patricia.brooks2@cms.hhs.gov., 840445=Verified corrections to the wage index data received timely by CMS and the fiscal intermediaries or the MACs (that is, by June 3, 2013) will be incorporated into the final wage index in the FY 2014 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule, which will be effective October 1, 2013., 288933=We believe that the analytic findings described in section II.E. of the preamble of this proposed rule support our original decision to break out and create new cost centers for implantable devices, MRIs, CT scans, and cardiac catheterization. Therefore, beginning in FY 2014, we are proposing to calculate the MS-DRG relative weights using 19 CCRs, creating distinct CCRs from cost report data for implantable devices, MRIs, CT scans, and cardiac catheterization., 572557=In FY 2012, we prepared the ICD-10 MS-DRGs Version 29.0, based on the FY 2012 MS-DRGs (Version 29.0) that we finalized in the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule. We posted a Definitions Manual of ICD-10 MS-DRGs Version 29.0 on our ICD-10 MS-DRG Conversion Project Web site. We also prepared a document that describes changes made from Version 28.0 to Version 29.0 to facilitate a review. The ICD-10 MS-DRGs Version 29.0 was discussed at the ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee meeting on March 5, 2012. Information was provided on the types of updates made. Once again the public was encouraged to review and comment on the most recent update to the ICD-10 MS-DRGs., 351629=In Appendix B of this proposed rule, as required by sections 1886(e)(4) and (e)(5) of the Act, we provide our recommendations of the appropriate percentage changes for FY 2014 for the following:, 570388=During FY 2011, we developed and posted Version 28.0 of the ICD-10 MS-DRGs based on the FY 2011 MS-DRGs (Version 28.0) that we finalized in the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule on the CMS Web site. This ICD-10 MS-DRGs Version 28.0 also included the CC Exclusion List and the ICD-10 version of the hospital-acquired conditions (HACs), which was not posted with Version 26.0. We also discussed this update at the September 15-16, 2010 and the March 9-10, 2011 meetings of the ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee. The minutes of these two meetings are posted on the CMS Web site at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD9ProviderDiagnosticCodes/index.html., 304541=The proposed FY 2010-based IPPS capital input price index update (as measured by percentage increase) for FY 2014 is currently forecasted to be 1.2 percent, 0.2 percentage points lower than the update based on the FY 2006-based capital input price index. Therefore, we are projecting that there would be a fiscal impact of \u2212$16 million to the IPPS capital payments in FY 2014 as a result of this proposal (0.2 percentage points * annual capital IPPS payments of approximately $8 billion)., 648105=The new technology add-on payment regulations provide that \u201ca medical service or technology may be considered new within 2 or 3 years after the point at which data begin to become available reflecting the ICD-9-CM code assigned to the new service or technology\u201d (\u00a7 412.87(b)(2)). Our practice has been to begin and end new technology add-on payments on the basis of a fiscal year, and we have generally followed a guideline that uses a 6-month window before and after the start of the fiscal year to determine whether to extend the new technology add-on payment for an additional fiscal year. In general, we extend add-on payments for an additional year only if the 3-year anniversary date of the product's entry on the market occurs in the latter half of the fiscal year (70 FR 47362). With regard to the newness criterion for the AutoLITT TM, as stated above, we consider the beginning of the newness period for the device to commence when the AutoLITT TM was first available on May 11, 2010. Because the 3-year anniversary date of the AutoLITT TM entry onto the market will expire May 11, 2013, which is prior to the beginning of FY 2014, we are proposing to discontinue new technology add-on payments for the AutoLITT TM for FY 2014. We are inviting public comments on this proposal., 269063=4. Proposed LTCH PPS Wage Index for FY 2014, 634869=To improve the understanding of CMS' processes for coverage, coding, and payment and how to access them, the CTI has developed an \u201cInnovator's Guide\u201d to these processes. The intent is to consolidate this information, much of which is already available in a variety of CMS documents and in various places on the CMS Web site, in a user-friendly format. This guide was published in August 2008 and is available on the CMS Web site at: http://www.cms.gov/CouncilonTechInnov/Downloads/InnovatorsGuide5_10_10.pdf., 274934=B. Proposed Update for SCHs for FY 2014, 659086=Cook\u00ae Medical submitted an application for new technology add-on payments for the Zenith\u00ae Fenestrated Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) Endovascular Graft (Zenith\u00ae F. Graft) for FY 2013. The applicant stated that the current treatment for patients who have had an AAA is an endovascular graft. The applicant explained that the Zenith\u00ae F. Graft is an implantable device designed to treat patients who have an AAA and who are anatomically unsuitable for treatment with currently approved AAA endovascular grafts because of the length of the infrarenal aortic neck. The applicant noted that, currently, an AAA is treated through an open surgical repair or medical management for those patients not eligible for currently approved AAA endovascular grafts., 914120=The CIPI was originally described in the FY 1993 IPPS final rule (57 FR 40016). There have been subsequent discussions of the CIPI presented in the IPPS proposed and final payment rules. The FY 2010 IPPS/RY 2010 LTCH PPS final rule (74 FR 43857) discussed the most recent rebasing and revision of the CIPI to a FY 2006 base year, which reflected the capital cost structure of the hospital industry in that year., 247092=g. Steps for Determining the Proposed FY 2014 MS-LTC-DRG Relative Weights, 191997=Jennifer Dupee, (410) 786-6537, and Jennifer Phillips, (410) 786-1023, Medical Review Criteria for Hospital Inpatient Services under Medicare Part A., 510382=Because the relative resource intensity of surgical classes can shift as a function of MS-DRG reclassification and recalibrations, for FY 2014, we reviewed the surgical hierarchy of each MDC, as we have for previous reclassifications and recalibrations, to determine if the ordering of classes coincides with the intensity of resource utilization., 392851=As we discussed in the FY 2009 IPPS final rule (73 FR 48458) and in the CY 2009 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (73 FR 68519 through 68527), in addition to the findings regarding implantable devices, RTI also found that the costs and charges of computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cardiac catheterization differ significantly from the costs and charges of other services included in the standard associated cost center. RTI also concluded that both the IPPS and the OPPS relative weights would better estimate the costs of those services if CMS were to add standard cost centers for CT scans, MRIs, and cardiac catheterization in order for hospitals to report separately the costs and charges for those services and in order for CMS to calculate unique CCRs to estimate the costs from charges on claims data. In the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (75 FR 50075 through 50080), we finalized our proposal to create standard cost centers for CT scans, MRIs, and cardiac catheterization, and to require that hospitals report the costs and charges for these services under new cost centers on the revised Medicare cost report Form CMS-2552-10. (We refer readers to the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (75 FR 50075 through 50080) for a detailed discussion of the reasons for the creation of standard cost centers for CT scans, MRIs, and cardiac catheterization.) The new standard cost centers for CT scans, MRIs, and cardiac catheterization are effective for cost report periods beginning on or after May 1, 2010, on the revised cost report Form CMS-2552-10., 655976=After evaluation of the newness, costs, and substantial clinical improvement criteria for new technology add-on payments for DIFICID TM and consideration of the public comments we received in response to the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule, we approved DIFICID TM for new technology add-on payments for FY 2013. Cases of DIFICID TM are identified with ICD-9-CM diagnosis code 008.45 (Intestinal infection due to Clostridium difficile) in combination with NDC code 52015-0080-01. Providers must report the NDC on the 837i Health Care Claim Institutional form (in combination with ICD-9-CM diagnosis code 008.45) in order to receive the new technology add-on payment. According to the applicant, the cost of DIFICID TM is $2,800 for a 10-day dosage. The average cost per day for DIFICID TM is $280 ($2,800/10). Cases of DIFICID TM within the inpatient setting typically incur an average dosage of 6.2 days, which results in an average cost per case for DIFICID TM of $1,736 ($280 \u00d7 6.2). Under \u00a7 412.88(a)(2), new technology add-on payments are limited to the lesser of 50 percent of the average cost of the technology or 50 percent of the costs in excess of the MS-DRG payment for the case. As a result, the maximum new technology add-on payment for FY 2013 for DIFICID TM is $868., 948584=Consistent with current law, and based on IGI's first quarter 2013 forecast of the FY 2014 market basket increase, we are proposing an applicable percentage increase to the FY 2014 operating standardized amount of 1.8 percent (that is, the FY 2014 estimate of the market basket rate-of-increase of 2.5 percent less an adjustment of 0.4 percentage point for economy-wide productivity (that is, the MFP adjustment) and less 0.3 percentage point) for hospitals in all areas, provided the hospital submits quality data under rules established in accordance with section 1886(b)(3)(B)(viii) of the Act. For hospitals that do not submit these quality data, we are proposing an applicable percentage increase to the operating standardized amount of \u22120.2 percent (that is, the FY 2014 estimate of the market basket rate-of-increase of 2.5 percent, less 2.0 percentage points for failure to submit quality data, less an adjustment of 0.4 percentage point for the MFP adjustment, and less an additional adjustment of 0.3 percentage point). Lastly, we also are proposing that if more recent data become subsequently available (for example, a more recent estimate of the market basket and MFP adjustment), we would use such data, if appropriate, to determine the FY 2014 market basket update and MFP adjustment in the final rule., 636542=We note that applicants for add-on payments for new medical services or technologies for FY 2015 must submit a formal request, including a full description of the clinical applications of the medical service or technology and the results of any clinical evaluations demonstrating that the new medical service or technology represents a substantial clinical improvement, along with a significant sample of data to demonstrate that the medical service or technology meets the high-cost threshold. Complete application information, along with final deadlines for submitting a full application, will be posted as it becomes available on the CMS Web site at: http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/newtech.html. To allow interested parties to identify the new medical services or technologies under review before the publication of the proposed rule for FY 2015, the Web site also will post the tracking forms completed by each applicant., 253093=b. Procedural Requirements for the FY 2016 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years, 908358=We also are proposing to update the labor-related share for Puerto Rico. Consistent with our methodology for determining the national labor-related share, we calculate the Puerto Rico-specific relative weights for wages and salaries, employee benefits, and contract labor using FY 2010 Medicare cost report data for IPPS hospitals located in Puerto-Rico. Because there are no Puerto Rico-specific relative weights for professional fees and labor intensive services, we use the national weights as shown in Table IV05. This is the same methodology we used to determine the FY 2006-based Puerto Rico-specific labor-related share derived during the FY 2006-based IPPS market basket rebasing (74 FR 43856)., 813175=We stated that we intended to further evaluate the need, applicability, and methodology for the imputed floor before the September 30, 2013 expiration of the imputed floor policy and address these issues in the FY 2014 proposed rule. For FY 2014, we are proposing to extend the imputed floor policy (both the original methodology and the alternative methodology) for one additional year, through September 30, 2014, while we continue to explore potential wage index reforms. We are proposing to revise the regulations at \u00a7 412.64(h)(4) to reflect the proposed 1-year extension. We are inviting public comments regarding the 1-year extension of the imputed floor., 185871=When commenting, please refer to file code CMS-1599-P. Because of staff and resource limitations, we cannot accept comments by facsimile (FAX) transmission., 979170=In a Federal Register notice published on March 7, 2013 (78 FR 14689) (hereinafter referred to as the FY 2013 IPPS notice), we announced the extension of the Affordable Care Act amendments to the low-volume hospital payment adjustment requirements under section 1886(d)(12) of the Act for FY 2013 pursuant to section 605 of the ATRA. The applicable low-volume hospital percentage increase provided for by the provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the ATRA is determined using a continuous linear sliding scale equation that results in a low-volume hospital payment adjustment ranging from an additional 25 percent for hospitals with 200 or fewer Medicare discharges to a zero percent additional payment adjustment for hospitals with 1,600 or more Medicare discharges., 918054=Table IV07 presents a comparison of the proposed FY 2010-based CIPI cost weights and the FY 2006-based CIPI cost weights., 264734=3. Quality Reporting Data Architecture Category III (QRDA-III) Option in 2014, 235647=3. FY 2014 Proposals for the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, 232707=1. Proposed FY 2014 Inpatient Hospital Update, 371529=In the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (76 FR 51489 and 51497), we indicated that because further delay of this prospective adjustment will result in a continued accrual of unrecoverable overpayments, it was imperative that we implement a prospective adjustment for FY 2012, while recognizing CMS' continued desire to mitigate the effects of any significant downward adjustments to hospitals. Therefore, we implemented a \u22122.0 percent prospective adjustment to the standardized amount to partially eliminate the full effect of the documentation and coding changes that do not reflect real changes in case-mix on future payments., 359406=For FY 2009, section 7(a) of Public Law 110-90 required a documentation and coding adjustment of \u22120.9 percent, and we finalized that adjustment through rulemaking (73 FR 48447). The documentation and coding adjustments established in the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment period, which reflected the amendments made by Public Law 110-90, are cumulative. As a result, the \u22120.9 percent documentation and coding adjustment for FY 2009 was in addition to the \u22120.6 percent adjustment for FY 2008, yielding a combined effect of \u22121.5 percent., 743790=With regard to the cost criterion, the applicant conducted four separate analyses. The applicant noted that while ICD-9-CM procedure code 35.97 groups to MS-DRGs 246 (Percutaneous Cardiovascular Procedure with Drug- Eluting Stent with Major Complication or Comorbidity (MCC) or 4+ Vessels/Stents), 247 (Percutaneous Cardiovascular Procedure with Drug-Eluting Stent without MCC), 248 (Percutaneous Cardiovascular Procedure with Non-Drug-Eluting Stent with MCC or 4+ Vessels/Stents), 249 (Percutaneous Cardiovascular Procedure with Non-Drug-Eluting Stent without MCC), 250 (Percutaneous Cardiovascular Procedure without Coronary Artery Stent or AMI with MCC), and 251 (Percutaneous Cardiovascular Procedure without Coronary Artery Stent or AMI without MCC), clinical experience with the MitraClip\u00ae has demonstrated that it is extremely rare for a patient to receive stents concurrently with the MitraClip\u00ae procedure. The applicant further cited the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 55308) which stated, \u201cAccording to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) terms of the clinical trial for MitraClip TM, the device is to be implanted in patients without any additional surgeries performed. Therefore, based on these terms, we stated that while the procedure code is assigned to MS-DRGs 246 through 251, the most likely MS-DRG assignments would be MS-DRGs 250 and 251.\u201d As a result, the applicant stated that it conducted its analyses solely for MS-DRGs 250 and 251 to demonstrate that the cases involving MitraClip\u00ae meet the incremental cost thresholds provided in Table 10 for those MS-DRGs., 588867=Once the MedPAR data were trimmed and the statistical outliers were removed, the charges for each of the 19 cost groups for each claim were standardized to remove the effects of differences in area wage levels, IME and DSH payments, and for hospitals located in Alaska and Hawaii, the applicable cost-of-living adjustment. Because hospital charges include charges for both operating and capital costs, we standardized total charges to remove the effects of differences in geographic adjustment factors, cost-of-living adjustments, and DSH payments under the capital IPPS as well. Charges were then summed by MS-DRG for each of the 19 cost groups so that each MS-DRG had 19 standardized charge totals. These charges were then adjusted to cost by applying the national average CCRs developed from the FY 2011 cost report data., 612673=Using the FY 2011 cost report data, we removed CAHs, Indian Health Service hospitals, all-inclusive rate hospitals, and cost reports that represented time periods of less than 1 year (365 days). We included hospitals located in Maryland because we include their charges in our claims database. We then created CCRs for each provider for each cost center (see prior table for line items used in the calculations) and removed any CCRs that were greater than 10 or less than 0.01. We normalized the departmental CCRs by dividing the CCR for each department by the total CCR for the hospital for the purpose of trimming the data. We then took the logs of the normalized cost center CCRs and removed any cost center CCRs where the log of the cost center CCR was greater or less than the mean log plus/minus 3 times the standard deviation for the log of that cost center CCR. Once the cost report data were trimmed, we calculated a Medicare-specific CCR. The Medicare-specific CCR was determined by taking the Medicare charges for each line item from Worksheet D-3 and deriving the Medicare-specific costs by applying the hospital-specific departmental CCRs to the Medicare-specific charges for each line item from Worksheet D-3. Once each hospital's Medicare-specific costs were established, we summed the total Medicare-specific costs and divided by the sum of the total Medicare-specific charges to produce national average, charge-weighted CCRs., 260988=e. Proposed Timeline for Data Submission under the LTCHQR Program for the FY 2017 Payment Determination and Subsequent Program Determinations, 421230=Beginning in FY 2007, we have set forth proposals, and solicited and responded to public comments, to implement section 1886(d)(4)(D) of the Act through the IPPS annual rulemaking process. For specific policies addressed in each rulemaking cycle, including a detailed discussion of the collaborative interdepartmental process and public input regarding selected and potential candidate HACs, we refer readers to the following rules: the FY 2007 IPPS proposed rule (71 FR 24100) and final rule (71 FR 48051 through 48053); the FY 2008 IPPS proposed rule (72 FR 24716 through 24726) and final rule with comment period (72 FR 47200 through 47218); the FY 2009 IPPS proposed rule (73 FR 23547) and final rule (73 FR 48471); the FY 2010 IPPS/RY 2010 LTCH PPS proposed rule (74 FR 24106) and final rule (74 FR 43782); the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule (75 FR 23880) and final rule (75 FR 50080); the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule (76 FR 25810 through 25816) and final rule (76 FR 51504 through 51522); and the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule (77 FR 27892 through 27898) and final rule (77 FR 53283 through 53303). A complete list of the 11 current categories of HACs is included on the CMS Web site at: http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HospitalAcqCond/Hospital-Acquired_Conditions.html., 382378=Section 1886(d)(3)(A)(vi) of the Act authorizes adjustments to the average standardized amounts if the Secretary determines such adjustments to be necessary for any subsequent fiscal years in order to eliminate the effect of coding or classification changes that do not reflect real changes in case-mix. After review of comments and recommendations received in a FY 2012 public comment letter from MedPAC (available on the Internet at: http://www.medpac.gov/documents/06172011_FY12IPPS_MedPAC_COMMENT.pdf), we analyzed claims data in FY 2010 to determine whether any additional adjustment would be appropriate to ensure that the introduction of MS-DRGs was implemented in a budget neutral manner. We analyzed FY 2010 data on claims paid through December 2011 using the same claims-based methodology as described in previous rulemaking (73 FR 43768 and 43775). We determined a total additional prospective documentation and coding effect of 0.8 percent through FY 2010 and found that this effect was present for both IPPS hospitals paid with the standardized amount and IPPS hospitals paid using their hospital-specific payment rates., 239121=9. Proposed FY 2016 Hospital VBP Program Scoring Methodology, 796936=As stated earlier, section 304(c) of Public Law 106-554 amended section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act to require CMS to collect data every 3 years on the occupational mix of employees for each short-term, acute care hospital participating in the Medicare program. We used occupational mix data collected on the 2010 survey to compute the occupational mix adjustment for FY 2013 and the proposed FY 2014 wage index associated with this proposed rule. We also plan to use the 2010 survey data for the FY 2015 wage index. Therefore, a new measurement of occupational mix will be required for FY 2016., 739760=Mitral regurgitation (MR), also referred to as mitral insufficiency or mitral incompetence, occurs when the mitral valve fails to close completely causing the blood to leak or flow backwards (regurgitate) into the mitral valve as the heart contracts. If the amount of blood that leaks back into the mitral valve is minimal then intervention is usually not necessary. However, if the amount of blood becomes significant this can cause the left ventricle to work harder to meet the body's need for oxygenated blood. Severity levels of MR can range from grade 1+ through grade 4+. If left untreated, severe mitral regurgitation can lead to heart failure and death. The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) issued practice guidelines in 2006 recommending intervention for moderate-severe or severe MR (3+ to 4+). The applicant stated that the MitraClip\u00ae System is intended \u201cfor patients with symptomatic, significant mitral regurgitation who have been determined by a cardiac surgeon to be too high risk for open mitral valve surgery and in whom existing co-morbidities would not preclude the expected benefit from correction of the mitral regurgitation.\u201d, 822834=Changes to the wage index that result from withdrawals of requests for reclassification, terminations, wage index corrections, appeals, and the Administrator's review process for FY 2014 will be incorporated into the wage index values published in the FY 2014 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule. These changes affect not only the wage index value for specific geographic areas, but also the wage index value redesignated/reclassified hospitals receive; that is, whether they receive the wage index that includes the data for both the hospitals already in the area and the redesignated/reclassified hospitals. Further, the wage index value for the area from which the hospitals are redesignated/reclassified may be affected., 615271=The proposed 19 national average CCRs for FY 2014 are as follows:, 266828=Addendum\u2014Proposed Schedule of Standardized Amounts, Update Factors, and Rate-of-Increase Percentages Effective With Cost Reporting Periods Beginning on or After October 1, 2013 and Payment Rates for LTCHs Effective With Discharges Occurring on or After October 1, 2013, 937862=After the capital cost category weights were computed, it was necessary to select appropriate price proxies to reflect the rate-of-increase for each expenditure category. We are proposing to use the same price proxies for the FY 2010-based CIPI that were used in the FY 2006-based CIPI. The rationale for selecting the price proxies was explained more fully in the FY 1997 IPPS final rule (61 FR 46196) and the FY 2010 IPPS/RY 2010 LTCH PPS final rule (74 FR 43857). These proposed price proxies are presented in Table IV07., 901210=In the proposed FY 2010-based IPPS market basket, nonmedical professional fees that were subject to allocation based on the survey results represent 2.059 percent of total costs (and are limited to those fees related to Accounting & Auditing, Legal, Engineering, and Management Consulting services). Based on our survey results, we are apportioning 1.301 percentage points of the 2.059 percentage point figure into the labor-related share and designating the remaining 0.758 percentage point as nonlabor-related., 811274=In the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 53368 through 53369), for the FY 2013 wage index, the final year of the extension of the imputed floor policy under \u00a7 412.64(h)(4), we did not make any changes to the original methodology and we finalized a proposed alternative, temporary methodology for computing the imputed floor wage index to address the concern that the then-current imputed floor methodology guaranteed a benefit for one all-urban State with multiple wage indices but could not benefit the other. The alternative methodology for calculating the imputed floor was established using data from the application of the rural floor policy for FY 2013. We first determined the average percentage difference between the post-reclassified, pre-floor area wage index and the post-reclassified, rural floor wage index (without rural floor budget neutrality applied) for all CBSAs receiving the rural floor. (Table 4D associated with the FY 2013 rule, which is available on the CMS Web site, included the CBSAs receiving a State's rural floor wage index.) The lowest post-reclassified wage index assigned to a hospital in an all-urban State having a range of such values would then be increased by this factor, the result of which established the State's alternative imputed floor. We refer to this methodology as the alternative methodology. We also adopted a policy that, for discharges on or after October 1, 2012, and before October 1, 2013, the minimum wage index value for the State is the higher of the value determined under the original methodology or the value computed using the alternative methodology. We amended \u00a7 412.64(h)(4) of the regulations to add new paragraph (vi) to incorporate the finalized alternative methodology policies, and to make conforming references in paragraph (v)., 437487=Evidence-based guidelines that included specific recommendations for the prevention of the condition were identified for each of the selected conditions. In addition, evidence-based guidelines also were found for the previously considered candidate conditions. RTI prepared a final report to summarize its findings regarding evidence-based guidelines. This report can be found on the CMS Web site at: http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HospitalAcqCond/Hospital-Acquired_Conditions.html. Subsequent to this final report, RTI has been awarded an FY 2014 Evidence-Based Guidelines Monitoring contract. Under the contract, RTI will provide a summary report of all evidence-based guidelines available for each of the selected and previously considered candidate HACs that provide recommendations for the prevention of the corresponding conditions. Updates to the guidelines will be made available to the public., 319639=Although payments to most hospitals under the IPPS are made on the basis of the standardized amounts, some categories of hospitals are paid in whole or in part based on their hospital-specific rate, which is determined from their costs in a base year. For example, sole community hospitals (SCHs) receive the higher of a hospital-specific rate based on their costs in a base year (the highest of FY 1982, FY 1987, FY 1996, or FY 2006) or the IPPS Federal rate based on the standardized amount. Through and including FY 2006, a Medicare-dependent, small rural hospital (MDH) received the higher of the Federal rate or the Federal rate plus 50 percent of the amount by which the Federal rate is exceeded by the higher of its FY 1982 or FY 1987 hospital-specific rate. As discussed below, for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2007, but before October 1, 2013, an MDH will receive the higher of the Federal rate or the Federal rate plus 75 percent of the amount by which the Federal rate is exceeded by the highest of its FY 1982, FY 1987, or FY 2002 hospital-specific rate. (We note that the statutory provision for payments to MDHs expires at the end of FY 2013, that is, on September 30, 2013.) SCHs are the sole source of care in their areas, and MDHs are a major source of care for Medicare beneficiaries in their areas. Specifically, section 1886(d)(5)(D)(iii) of the Act defines an SCH as a hospital that is located more than 35 road miles from another hospital or that, by reason of factors such as isolated location, weather conditions, travel conditions, or absence of other like hospitals (as determined by the Secretary), is the sole source of hospital inpatient services reasonably available to Medicare beneficiaries. In addition, certain rural hospitals previously designated by the Secretary as essential access community hospitals are considered SCHs. Section 1886(d)(5)(G)(iv) of the Act defines an MDH as a hospital that is located in a rural area, has not more than 100 beds, is not an SCH, and has a high percentage of Medicare discharges (not less than 60 percent of its inpatient days or discharges in its cost reporting year beginning in FY 1987 or in two of its three most recently settled Medicare cost reporting years). Both of these categories of hospitals are afforded this special payment protection in order to maintain access to services for beneficiaries., 834942=In the October 19, 2012 memorandum, we also specified that a hospital requesting revisions to its occupational mix survey data was to copy its record(s) from the CY 2010 occupational mix preliminary files posted to the CMS Web site in October, highlight the revised cells on its spreadsheet, and submit its spreadsheet(s) and complete documentation to its fiscal intermediary/MAC no later than December 10, 2012., 751140=Using the methodology above, the applicant found 12 cases in MS-DRG 250 (22 percent of all cases) and 43 cases in MS-DRG 251 (78 percent of all cases), which resulted in a case-weighted average charge per case of $112,434. The applicant then standardized the charges using the FY 2011 final rule impact file and inflated the standardized charges using two different inflation factors. The first approach used a factor of 4.6 percent, which was based on data from the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics non-seasonally adjusted Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers between January 2011 and January 2013. This resulted in an inflated case-weighted average standardized charge per case of $97,289. The second approach used a factor of 18.6 percent based on the growth in charges between 2009 and 2011 in MS-DRGs 250 and 251 and adjusting for case-mix year over year. This resulted in an inflated case-weighted average standardized charge per case of $110,335., 857257=The index itself is constructed in three steps. First, a base period is selected (in this proposed rule, we are proposing to use FY 2010 as the base period) and total base period expenditures are estimated for a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive spending categories, with the proportion of total costs that each category represents being calculated. These proportions are called \u201ccost weights\u201d or \u201cexpenditure weights.\u201d Second, each expenditure category is matched to an appropriate price or wage variable, referred to as a \u201cprice proxy.\u201d In almost every instance, these price proxies are derived from publicly available statistical series that are published on a consistent schedule (preferably at least on a quarterly basis). Finally, the expenditure weight for each cost category is multiplied by the level of its respective price proxy. The sum of these products (that is, the expenditure weights multiplied by their price index levels) for all cost categories yields the composite index level of the market basket in a given period. Repeating this step for other periods produces a series of market basket levels over time. Dividing an index level for a given period by an index level for an earlier period produces a rate of growth in the input price index over that timeframe., 208783=MIEA-TRHCAMedicare Improvements and Extension Act, Division B of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, Public Law 109-432, 230510=2. FY 2014 MGCRB Reclassifications, 790332=As discussed in the FY 2012 final rule, in \u201cStep 5,\u201d for each hospital, we adjust the total salaries plus wage-related costs to a common period to determine total adjusted salaries plus wage-related costs. To make the wage adjustment, we estimate the percentage change in the employment cost index (ECI) for compensation for each 30-day increment from October 14, 2009, through April 15, 2011, for private industry hospital workers from the BLS' Compensation and Working Conditions. We have consistently used the ECI as the data source for our wages and salaries and other price proxies in the IPPS market basket, and we are not proposing any changes to the usage for FY 2014. The factors used to adjust the hospital's data were based on the midpoint of the cost reporting period, as indicated below., 256592=8. Public Display Requirements Beginning with FY 2015 Program Year, 820925=At the time this proposed rule was developed, the MGCRB had completed its review of FY 2014 reclassification requests. Based on such reviews, there were 332 hospitals approved for wage index reclassifications by the MGCRB for FY 2014. Because MGCRB wage index reclassifications are effective for 3 years, for FY 2014, hospitals reclassified during FY 2012 or FY 2013 are eligible to continue to be reclassified to a particular labor market area based on such prior reclassifications. There were 249 hospitals approved for wage index reclassifications in FY 2012, and 192 hospitals approved for wage index reclassifications in FY 2013. Of all the hospitals approved for reclassification for FY 2012, FY 2013, and FY 2014, based upon the review at the time of this proposed rule, 773 hospitals are in a reclassification status for FY 2014., 665934=We note that we are concerned that Kcentra TM may be substantially similar to FFP and/or Vitamin K therapy. If so, Kcentra TM would not meet the newness criterion because costs associated with FFP and/or Vitamin K therapy are already reflected within the MS-DRGs. In the FY 2010 IPPS/RY 2010 LTCH PPS final rule (74 FR 43813 through 43814), we established criteria for evaluating whether a new technology is substantial similar to an existing technology, specifically: (1) whether a product uses the same or a similar mechanism of action to achieve a therapeutic outcome; (2) whether a product is assigned to the same or a different MS-DRG; and (3) whether the new use of the technology involves the treatment of the same or similar type of disease and the same or similar patient population. If a technology meets all three of the criteria above, it would be considered substantially similar to an existing technology and would not be considered \u201cnew\u201d for purposes of new technology add-on payments., 503533=The requestor noted that diagnosis code 751.1 was removed from the Integrated Outpatient Code Editor (IOCE) effective January 1, 2006. Our clinical advisors agree that patients described with any one of the above listed codes, although congenital anomalies, may require a revision procedure in adulthood. Therefore, we believe that the removal of these codes appears appropriate and also would be consistent with the IOCE., 423990=Currently, as we discussed in the prior rulemaking cited above, the POA indicator reporting requirement only applies to IPPS hospitals because they are subject to this HAC provision. Non-IPPS hospitals, including CAHs, LTCHs, IRFs, IPFs, cancer hospitals, children's hospitals, hospitals in Maryland operating under waivers, RNHCIs, and the Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense hospitals, are exempt from POA reporting. We note that hospitals in Maryland operating under their waiver are not paid under the IPPS but rather are paid under the provisions of section 1814(b)(3) of the Act. This waiver applies to the amount paid to providers of services, and does not extend to billing requirements and other reporting requirements. In fact, hospitals in Maryland are required to submit Medicare claims for Medicare payment and also to submit the same information on their Medicare claims as hospitals in other parts of the country paid under the IPPS. Therefore, we believe it is inappropriate to continue to exempt hospitals in Maryland from the POA indicator reporting requirement. Under current policy, hospitals in Maryland will continue to be exempt from the application of this HAC provision so long as they are not paid under the IPPS. However, we believe it is appropriate to require them to use POA indicator reporting on their claims so that we can include their data and have as complete a dataset as possible when we analyze trends and make further payment policy determinations, such as those authorized under section 1886(p) of the Act. (We refer readers to section V.I. of the preamble to this proposed rule for a discussion of our proposals to implement section 1886(p) of the Act.) Therefore, we are proposing that hospitals in Maryland operating under their waiver under section 1814(b)(3) of the Act will no longer be exempted from the POA indicator reporting requirement beginning with claims submitted on or after October 1, 2013, including all claims for discharges on or after October 1, 2013. We are inviting public comment regarding this proposal., 267809=III. Proposed Changes to Payment Rates for Acute Care Hospital Inpatient Capital-Related Costs for FY 2014, 452626=However, the data does reflect that the average costs for cases reporting diagnosis code V45.88 as a secondary diagnosis in MS-DRG 066 are more similar to the average costs of higher severity level cases in MS-DRG 065. Therefore, for FY 2014, we are proposing to move cases with diagnosis code V45.88 from MS-DRG 066 to MS-DRG 065, and to revise the title of MS-DRG 065 to reflect the patients status post tPA administration within 24 hours. The proposed revised MS-DRG title would be: MS-DRG 065 (Intracranial Hemorrhage or Cerebral Infarction with CC or tPA in 24 Hours)., 229398=3.

Method for Computing the Proposed FY 2014 Unadjusted Wage Index, 433105=We are not proposing to add or remove categories of HACs at this time. However, we continue to encourage public dialogue about refinements to the HAC list by written stakeholder comments about both previously selected and potential candidate HACs. We refer readers to section II.F.6. of the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment period (72 FR 47202 through 47218) and to section II.F.7. of the FY 2009 IPPS final rule (73 FR 48774 through 48491) for detailed discussion supporting our determination regarding each of these conditions. We also refer readers to section III.F.5. of the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule (77 FR 27892 through 27898) and the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 53285 through 53292) for the HAC policy for FY 2013.

Proposed Medicare Severity Long-Term Care Diagnosis-Related Group (MS-LTC-DRG) Classifications and Relative Weights for FY 2014, 818376=Under section 1886(d)(10) of the Act, the MGCRB considers applications by hospitals for geographic reclassification for purposes of payment under the IPPS. Hospitals must apply to the MGCRB to reclassify not later than 13 months prior to the start of the fiscal year for which reclassification is sought (generally by September 1). Generally, hospitals must be proximate to the labor market area to which they are seeking reclassification and must demonstrate characteristics similar to hospitals located in that area. The MGCRB issues its decisions by the end of February for reclassifications that become effective for the following fiscal year (beginning October 1). The regulations applicable to reclassifications by the MGCRB are located in 42 CFR 412.230 through 412.280. (We refer readers to a discussion in the FY 2002 IPPS final rule (66 FR 39874 and 39875) regarding how the MGCRB defines mileage for purposes of the proximity requirements.) The general policies for reclassifications and redesignations that we are proposing for FY 2014, and the policies for the effects of hospitals' reclassifications and redesignations on the wage index, are the same as those discussed in the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule for the FY 2012 final wage index (76 FR 51595 and 51596). Also, in the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule, we discussed the effects on the wage index of urban hospitals reclassifying to rural areas under 42 CFR 412.103. Hospitals that are geographically located in States without any rural areas are ineligible to apply for rural reclassification pursuant to 42 CFR 412.103., 274461=VIII. Executive Order 12866, 726240=The applicant received FDA approval on November 15, 2012, for the Zilver\u00ae PTX\u00ae. The applicant maintains that the Zilver\u00ae PTX\u00ae is the first drug-eluting stent used for superficial femoral arteries. The technology is currently described by ICD-9-CM procedure code 00.60 (Insertion of drug-eluting stent(s) of the superficial femoral artery). We are inviting public comments regarding how the Zilver\u00ae PTX\u00ae meets the newness criterion., 534896=Therefore, for FY 2014, we are proposing to remove the following diagnosis codes from the CC Exclusion List for diagnosis code 440.4: atherosclerosis codes 440.20 through 440.32, 443.22, and 443.29, and aneurysm codes 441.00 through 441.03, 441.1 through 441.7, 441.9, 442.0, 442.2, 442.3, and 442.9. Diagnosis codes 443.81 through 443.9 would remain on the CC Exclusion List for diagnosis code 440.4. We are inviting public comments on this proposal., 986378=For FY 2014, we would continue to use the established process for requesting and obtaining the low-volume hospital payment adjustment. That is, in order to receive a low-volume hospital payment adjustment under \u00a7 412.101, a hospital must notify and provide documentation to its fiscal intermediary or MAC that it meets the discharge and distance requirements. The fiscal intermediary or MAC will determine, based on the most recent data available, if the hospital qualifies as a low-volume hospital, so that the hospital will know in advance whether or not it will receive a payment adjustment. The fiscal intermediary or MAC and CMS may review available data, in addition to the data the hospital submits with its request for low-volume hospital status, in order to determine whether or not the hospital meets the qualifying criteria. (For additional details on our established process for the low-volume hospital payment adjustment, we refer readers to the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 53408).), 225062=b. Proposed CC Exclusions List for FY 2014, 264061=10. Reconsideration and Appeals Procedures for the FY 2014 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years, 794196=For example, the midpoint of a cost reporting period beginning January 1, 2010, and ending December 31, 2010, is June 30, 2010. An adjustment factor of 1.01235 would be applied to the wages of a hospital with such a cost reporting period., 731933=The applicant used the same methodology above to demonstrate that it meets the cost criterion with the only difference being that it included cases that used one or two bare metal stents instead of just one bare metal stent. Using this methodology, the applicant determined a final inflated case-weighted average standardized charge per case of $62,455. Using the FY 2014 Table 10 thresholds, the case-weighted threshold for MS-DRGs 252, 253, and 254 was $54,474 (all calculations above were performed using unrounded numbers). Because the final inflated case-weighted average standardized charge per case for the applicable MS-DRGs exceeded the case-weighted threshold amount, the applicant maintained that the Zilver\u00ae PTX\u00ae would meet the cost criterion., 887882=We are proposing to use the PPI for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, Prescription (BLS series code WPUSI07003) to measure the price growth of this cost category. This is the same proxy that was used in the FY 2006-based IPPS market basket, although BLS since changed the naming convention for this series., 821809=Under the regulations at 42 CFR 412.273, hospitals that have been reclassified by the MGCRB are permitted to withdraw their applications within 45 days of the publication of a proposed rule. For information about withdrawing, terminating, or canceling a previous withdrawal or termination of a 3-year reclassification for wage index purposes, we refer readers to 42 CFR 412.273, as well as the FY 2002 IPPS final rule (66 FR 39887 through 39888) and the FY 2003 IPPS final rule (67 FR 50065 through 50066). Additional discussion on withdrawals and terminations, and clarifications regarding reinstating reclassifications and \u201cfallback\u201d reclassifications, were included in the FY 2008 IPPS final rule (72 FR 47333)., 248865=2. MedPAC's 2004 Report to Congress, 235997=c. Proposed Expansion of the Applicable Conditions for FY 2015, 958688=Section 412.96(c)(1) provides that CMS establish updated national and regional CMI values in each year's annual notice of prospective payment rates for purposes of determining RRC status. The methodology we used to determine the national and regional CMI values is set forth in the regulations at \u00a7 412.96(c)(1)(ii). The proposed national median CMI value for FY 2014 includes data from all urban hospitals nationwide, and the proposed regional values for FY 2014 are the median CMI values of urban hospitals within each census region, excluding those hospitals with approved teaching programs (that is, those hospitals that train residents in an approved GME program as provided in \u00a7 413.75). These proposed values are based on discharges occurring during FY 2012 (October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012), and include bills posted to CMS' records through December 2012., 255697=3. Previously Finalized Quality Measures for PCHs Beginning with the FY 2014 Program, 852361=In the FY 2010 IPPS/RY 2010 LTCH PPS final rule (74 FR 43850 through 43856), we also rebased and revised the labor-related share for the Puerto Rico-specific standardized amounts using FY 2006 as a base year. We finalized a labor-related share for the Puerto Rico-specific standardized amounts for FY 2010 through FY 2013 of 62.1 percent. As described in section IV. of the preamble of this proposed rule, for FY 2014, we also are proposing to rebase and revise the labor-related share for the Puerto Rico-specific standardized amounts using FY 2010 as a base year. For FY 2014, we are proposing a labor-related share for the Puerto Rico-specific standardized amounts of 63.2 percent for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2013. Consistent with our methodology for determining the national labor-related share, we added the Puerto Rico-specific relative weights for wages and salaries, employee benefits, contract labor, with the national proportion of costs for the labor-related portion of professional fees, administrative and facilities support services, and all other labor-related services to determine the labor-related share. Puerto Rico hospitals are paid based on 75 percent of the national standardized amounts and 25 percent of the Puerto Rico-specific standardized amounts. For FY 2014, we are proposing that the labor-related share of a hospital's Puerto Rico-specific rate will be either the Puerto Rico-specific labor-related share of 63.2 percent or 62 percent, depending on which results in higher payments to the hospital. If the hospital has a Puerto Rico-specific wage index of greater than 1.0 for FY 2014, we will set the hospital's rates using a labor-related share of 63.2 percent for the 25 percent portion of the hospital's payment determined by the Puerto Rico standardized amounts because this amount will result in higher payments. Conversely, a hospital with a Puerto Rico-specific wage index of less than 1.0 for FY 2014 will be paid using the Puerto Rico-specific labor-related share of 62 percent of the Puerto Rico-specific rates because the lower labor-related share will result in higher payments. The proposed Puerto Rico labor-related share of 63.2 percent for FY 2014 is reflected in Table 1C, which is published in section VI. of the Addendum to this proposed rule and available via the Internet., 419233=Section 1886(d)(4)(D) specifies that, by October 1, 2007, the Secretary was required to select, in consultation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), at least two conditions that: (a) Are high cost, high volume, or both; (b) are assigned to a higher paying MS-DRG when present as a secondary diagnosis (that is, conditions under the MS-DRG system that are CCs or MCCs); and (c) could reasonably have been prevented through the application of evidence-based guidelines. Section 1886(d)(4)(D) of the Act also specifies that the list of conditions may be revised, again in consultation with CDC, from time to time as long as the list contains at least two conditions., 930003=The vintage weights for the FY 2006-based CIPI and the proposed FY 2010-based CIPI are presented in Table IV08., 429771=In addition, as discussed elsewhere in section III.G.10. of the preamble of this proposed rule, the 5010 format allows the reporting and effective January 1, 2011, the processing of up to 25 diagnoses and 25 procedure codes. As such, it is necessary to report a valid POA indicator for each diagnosis code, including the principal and all secondary diagnoses up to 25., 753402=The applicant analyzed 98 claims from 21 sites (for discharges on or after October 1, 2011 through discharges on or before September 30, 2012 (FY 2012 claims data)) and excluded 18 cases because the cases either did not map to MS-DRGs 250 or 251, or the patient was below the age of 65 years. Of these remaining 80 cases, 17 mapped to MS-DRG 250 (21.3 percent of all cases) and 63 mapped to MS-DRG 251 (78.8 percent of all cases), which resulted in a case-weighted average charge per case of $112,509. The case-weighted average charge per case above includes clinical trial charges related to the MitraClip\u00ae System, which does not reflect the full commercial charge for the MitraClip\u00ae System. Therefore, the applicant removed the amount of clinical trial charges related to the MitraClip\u00ae System. The applicant then standardized the charges using the FY 2012 final rule impact file and inflated the standardized charges using the two different approaches described in the first and second analyses (an inflation factor of 4.6 percent and 18.6 percent, respectively)., 199145=BBRAMedicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP [State Children's Health Insurance Program] Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999, Public Law 106-113, 233812=3. Proposed Low-Volume Hospital Definition and Payment Adjustment for FY 2014 and Subsequent Years, 197939=ARRAAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Public Law 111-5, 856235=Since the inception of the IPPS, the projected change in the hospital market basket has been the integral component of the update factor by which the prospective payment rates are updated every year. An explanation of the hospital market basket used to develop the prospective payment rates was published in the Federal Register on September 1, 1983 (48 FR 39764). We also refer readers to the FY 2010 IPPS/RY 2010 LTCH PPS final rule (74 FR 43843) in which we discussed the most recent previous rebasing of the hospital input price index., 662107=As stated above, the new technology add-on payment regulations provide that \u201ca medical service or technology may be considered new within 2 or 3 years after the point at which data begin to become available reflecting the ICD-9-CM code assigned to the new service or technology\u201d (\u00a7 412.87(b)(2)). With regard to the newness criterion for the Zenith\u00ae F. Graft, as stated above, we consider the beginning of the newness period to commence when the Zenith\u00ae F. Graft was approved by the FDA on April 4, 2012. Because the Zenith\u00ae F. Graft is still within the 3-year newness period, we are proposing to continue new technology add-on payments for this technology for FY 2014. We are inviting public comments on this proposal., 1009445=Finally, section 1886(r)(3) of the Act provides that there shall be \u201cno administrative or judicial review under section 1869, section 1878, or otherwise\u201d of \u201cany estimate of the Secretary for purposes of determining the factors described in paragraph (2),\u201d or of \u201cany period selected by the Secretary\u201d for the purpose of determining those factors. Therefore, there can be no administrative or judicial review of the estimates developed for purposes of applying the three factors used to determine uncompensated care payments, or the periods selected in order to develop such estimates., 227030=3. FY 2014 Status of Technology Approved for FY 2013 Add-On Payments, 850383=The labor-related share is used to determine the proportion of the national IPPS base payment rate to which the area wage index is applied. As described in section IV. of the preamble of this proposed rule, we are proposing to include in the labor-related share the national average proportion of operating costs that are attributable to wages and salaries, employee benefits, contract labor, the labor-related portion of professional fees, administrative and facilities support services, and all other labor-related services as measured in the proposed IPPS market basket, as based on FY 2010. Therefore, for FY 2014, we are proposing to use a labor-related share of 69.6 percent for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2013. Tables 1A and 1B, which are published in section VI. of the Addendum to this proposed rule and are available via the Internet, reflect this proposed labor-related share. We note that section 403 of Public Law 108-173 amended sections 1886(d)(3)(E) and 1886(d)(9)(C)(iv) of the Act to provide that the Secretary must employ 62 percent as the labor-related share unless this employment \u201cwould result in lower payments to a hospital than would otherwise be made.\u201d Therefore, for FY 2014, for all IPPS hospitals whose wage indices are less than 1.0000, we are proposing to apply the wage index to a labor-related share of 62 percent of the national standardized amount. For all IPPS hospitals whose wage indices are greater than 1.0000, for FY 2014, we are proposing to apply the wage index to a labor-related share of 69.6 percent of the national standardized amount. We note that, for Puerto Rico hospitals, the national labor-related share is 62 percent because the national wage index for all Puerto Rico hospitals is less than 1.0., 260045=9. Form, Manner, and Timing of Quality Data Submission for the FY 2016 Payment Determination and Subsequent Payment Determinations, 988410=As we discussed in section V.C.2.b. of the preamble of this proposed rule, we are proposing to make conforming changes to the regulatory text at \u00a7 412.101 to reflect the extension of the changes to the qualifying criteria and the payment adjustment methodology for low-volume hospitals through FY 2013 made by section 605 of the ATRA. We are proposing changes to \u00a7 412.101 to conform the regulations to the statutory requirements that, beginning with FY 2014, the low-volume hospital qualifying criteria and payment adjustment methodology revert to that which was in effect prior to the amendments made by the Affordable Care Act and the ATRA (that is, the low-volume hospital payment adjustment policy in effect for FYs 2005 through 2010). Therefore, the low-volume hospital payment adjustment policy in effect prior for FYs 2005 through 2010 would apply for FY 2014 and subsequent years., 467809=We analyzed claims data from the FY 2012 MedPAR file for cases reporting a principal diagnosis code of 415.19 or a principal diagnosis code of 416.2 along with procedure codes 38.15, 39.61, 39.62, and 39.63. As displayed in the table below, there were a total of 11,287 cases in MS-DRG 163 with an average length of stay of approximately 13.33 days and average costs of approximately $32,728. Using the combination of diagnosis and procedure codes as described above, the total number of cases found in MS-DRG 163 was 12, with average costs ranging from approximately $46, 959 to $53,048 and an average length of stay ranging from approximately 13.50 days to 16.20 days. We acknowledge that the average length of stay and average costs for these cases are somewhat higher in comparison to the average lengths of stay and average costs of all the other cases in MS-DRG 163. However, the volume of cases was very low. The data reflect similar results for MS-DRG 164. Only 4 cases were identified in the analysis, with average costs ranging from approximately $21,669 to $37,447 and average lengths of stay ranging from approximately 7 days to 10 days., 568442=In response to the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule, we received comments on the creation of the ICD-10 version of the MS-DRGs, which will be implemented at the same time as ICD-10 (75 FR 50127 and 50128). As we stated earlier, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has delayed the compliance date of ICD-10 from October 1, 2013 to October 1, 2014 (77 FR 54664). While we did not propose an ICD-10 version of the MS DRGs in the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule, we noted that we have been actively involved in converting our current MS-DRGs from ICD-9-CM codes to ICD-10 codes and sharing this information through the ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee. We undertook this early conversion project to assist other payers and providers in understanding how to go about their own conversion projects. We posted ICD-10 MS-DRGs based on Version 26.0 (FY 2009) of the MS-DRGs. We also posted a paper that describes how CMS went about completing this project and suggestions for others to follow. All of this information can be found on the CMS Web site at: http://cms.hhs.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/ICD-10-MS-DRG-Conversion-Project.html. We have continued to keep the public updated on our maintenance efforts for ICD-10-CM and ICD 10-PCS coding systems, as well as the General Equivalence Mappings that assist in conversion through the ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee. Information on these committee meetings can be found on the CMS Web site at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD9ProviderDiagnosticCodes/index.html., 554052=While section 1886(d)(5)(K)(vii) of the Act states that the addition of new diagnosis and procedure codes on April 1 of each year shall not require the Secretary to adjust the payment, or DRG classification, under section 1886(d) of the Act until the fiscal year that begins after such date, we have to update the DRG software and other systems in order to recognize and accept the new codes. We also publicize the code changes and the need for a mid-year systems update by providers to identify the new codes. Hospitals also have to obtain the new code books and encoder updates, and make other system changes in order to identify and report the new codes., 938505=Table IV09 below compares both the historical and forecasted percent changes in the FY 2006-based CIPI and the proposed FY 2010-based CIPI., 959619=We are proposing that, in addition to meeting other criteria, if rural hospitals with fewer than 275 beds are to qualify for initial RRC status for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2013, they must have a CMI value for FY 2012 that is at least\u2014, 292959=In this proposed rule, we are proposing measures, scoring, and risk adjustment methodology to implement the FY 2015 payment adjustment under the HAC Reduction Program. Section 1886(p) of the Act, as added under section 3008(a) of the Affordable Care Act, establishes an adjustment to hospital payments for HACs, or a HAC Reduction program, under which payments to applicable hospitals are adjusted to provide an incentive to reduce HACs, effective for discharges beginning on October 1, 2014 and for subsequent program years. The amount of payment shall be equal to 99 percent of the amount of payment that would otherwise apply to such discharges under section 1886(d) or 1814(b)(3) of the Act, as applicable., 251300=a. Previously Adopted Hospital IQR Program Measures for the FY 2015 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years, 385759=After considering the public comments, we recognized that the issue of the estimate to use for the cumulative MS-DRG documentation and coding effect through FY 2010 may merit further consideration. Therefore, as discussed in the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 53278 through 53280), we decided not to finalize the proposed \u22120.8 percent adjustment to the standardized amount and the hospital-specific rate until more analysis could be completed., 776694=Section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act also provides for the collection of data every 3 years on the occupational mix of employees for short-term, acute care hospitals participating in the Medicare program, in order to construct an occupational mix adjustment to the wage index. A discussion of the occupational mix adjustment that we are proposing to apply beginning October 1, 2013 (the FY 2014 wage index) appears under section III.F. of the preamble of this proposed rule., 218276=(Pub. L. 111-152), and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (Pub. L. 112-240), 816149=The proposed wage index values for FY 2014 (except those for hospitals receiving wage index adjustments under section 1886(d)(13) of the Act), included in Tables 4A, 4B, 4C, and 4F, available on the CMS Web site, include the proposed occupational mix adjustment, geographic reclassification or redesignation as discussed in section III.H. of the preamble of this proposed rule, and the application of the rural, imputed, and frontier State floors as discussed in section III.G.2. of the preamble of this proposed rule., 825315=Section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act requires us to treat a hospital located in a rural county adjacent to one or more urban areas as being located in the MSA if certain criteria are met. Effective beginning FY 2005, we use OMB's 2000 CBSA standards and the Census 2000 data to identify counties in which hospitals qualify under section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act to receive the wage index of the urban area. (We note that, as mentioned in section III.B. of the preamble of this proposed rule, although OMB has issued revisions on February 28, 2013, to its area delineations based on 2010 census data, we are not proposing to adopt these revisions for the FY 2014 wage index.) Hospitals located in these counties have been known as \u201cLugar\u201d hospitals and the counties themselves are often referred to as \u201cLugar\u201d counties. The FY 2014 chart with the listing of the rural counties containing the hospitals designated as urban under section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act is available via the Internet on the CMS Web site., 580596=As we explain in section II.E.2. of the preamble of this proposed rule, we are proposing to calculate the relative weights based on 19 CCRs, instead of the 15 CCRs previously used. The methodology we used to calculate the proposed FY 2014 MS-DRG cost-based relative weights based on claims data in the FY 2012 MedPAR file and data from the FY 2011 Medicare cost reports is as follows:, 185295=Application Deadline for GME FTE Resident Slots from Closed Hospital. Applications from hospitals to receive GME FTE resident slots from a hospital's closure as described in section V.J.3.c. of the preamble of this proposed rule must be received, not postmarked, by 5 p.m. EST on July 25, 2013., 209417=MMAMedicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, Public Law 108-173, 244618=A. Proposed Rate-of-Increase in Payments to Excluded Hospitals for FY 2014, 548516=The Committee presented proposals for coding changes for implementation in FY 2014 at a public meeting held on September 19, 2012, and finalized the coding changes after consideration of comments received at the meetings and in writing by November 16, 2012. There were no changes to the ICD-9-CM coding system for FY 2014. There were no new, revised or deleted diagnosis or procedure codes for FY 2014., 518788=For FY 2014, there were no changes made to the ICD-9-CM coding system effective October 1, 2013, due to the partial code freeze. (We refer readers to section II.G.10. of the preamble of this proposed rule for a discussion of the ICD-9-CM coding system.), 256705=9. Form, Manner, and Timing of Data Submission Beginning with FY 2015 Program Year, 904206=In the proposed FY 2010-based IPPS market basket, NAICS 55 expenses that were subject to allocation based on the home office allocation methodology represent 5.650 percent of the total operating costs. Based on the home office results, we are apportioning 3.503 percentage points of the 5.650 percentage points figure into the labor-related share and designating the remaining 2.147 percentage points as nonlabor-related. In sum, based on the two proposed allocations mentioned above, we are proposing to apportion 4.804 percentage points into the labor-related share. This amount is added to the 0.696 percentage point of professional fees that we already identified as labor-related, resulting in a proposed professional fees: labor-related cost weight of 5.500 percent., 653190=Optimer Pharmaceuticals, Inc. submitted an application for new technology add-on payments for FY 2013 for the use of DIFICID TM tablets. As indicated on the labeling submitted to the FDA, the applicant noted that Fidaxomicin is taken twice a day as a daily dosage (200 mg tablet twice daily = 400 mg per day) as an oral antibiotic. The applicant asserted that Fidaxomicin provides potent bactericidal activity against C. Diff., and moderate bactericidal activity against certain other gram-positive organisms, such as enterococcus and staphylococcus. Unlike other antibiotics used to treat CDAD, the applicant noted that the effects of Fidaxomicin preserve bacteroides organisms in the fecal flora. These are markers of normal anaerobic microflora. The applicant asserted that this helps prevent pathogen introduction or persistence, which potentially inhibits the re-emergence of C. Diff., and reduces the likelihood of overgrowths as a result of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Because of this narrow spectrum of activity, the applicant asserted that Fidaxomicin does not alter this native intestinal microflora., 219271=D. Proposed FY 2014 MS-DRG Documentation and Coding Adjustment, 276541=Under various statutory authorities, we are proposing to make changes to the Medicare IPPS, to the LTCH PPS, and to other related payment methodologies and programs for FY 2014 and subsequent fiscal years. These statutory authorities include, but are not limited to, the following:, 687129=With respect to the newness criterion, according to the applicant, the FDA designated the Argus\u00ae II System a Humanitarian Use Device in May 2009 (HUD designation #09-0216). The applicant submitted a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) application (#H110002) to the FDA in May 2011 to obtain market approval for the Argus\u00ae II System. The HDE was referred to the Ophthalmic Devices Panel of the FDA's Medical Devices Advisory Committee for review and recommendation. At the Panel's meeting held on September 28, 2012, the Panel voted 19 to 0 that the probable benefits of the Argus\u00ae II System outweigh the risks of the system for the proposed indication for use. The applicant received the HDE approval from the FDA on February 14, 2013. Currently there are no other approved treatments for patients with severe to profound RP. The Argus\u00ae II System has an IDE number of G050001 and is a Class III device. There are no existing ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CMS/PCS codes for the implantation of a retina prosthesis. The applicant applied for three new ICD-9-CM procedure codes for consideration at the March 5, 2013 ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee meeting. More information on this request can be found on the CMS Web site at: http://cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD9ProviderDiagnosticCodes/ICD-9-CM-C-and-M-Meeting-Materials-Items/2013-03-05-MeetingMaterials.html. We note that any final decisions on new codes approved at the March 5, 2013 Coordination and Maintenance Committee meeting will be included in the ICD-9-CM code addendum posted on the CMS Web site in June 2013 at: http://cms.hhs.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD9ProviderDiagnosticCodes/addendum.html. In addition, code revisions that were discussed at the March 5, 2013 Committee meeting but that could not be finalized in time to include them in the tables for this proposed rule will be included in the appropriate table in the final rule (the tables for both the proposed rule and the final rule are made available via the Internet on the CMS Web site). We are inviting public comments on whether the Argus\u00ae II System meets the newness criterion., 866958=After the allocation of contract labor, the proposed FY 2010-based wages and salaries cost weight is relatively similar to the FY 2006-based wages and salaries cost weight while the proposed FY 2010-based employee benefits cost weight increased 0.7 percentage point. This is primarily a result of an increase in benefits costs relative to wages and salaries costs from the Medicare cost report data for employed workers; in 2006, the ratio of the employee benefits cost weight to the wages and salaries cost weight was 26.3 percent while in 2010, this ratio increased to 27.8 percent., 982367=In the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (75 FR 50238 through 50275 and 50414), we amended the regulations at \u00a7 412.101 to specify that, beginning with FY 2013, the low-volume hospital definition and payment adjustment methodology reverted to the policy established under statutory requirements that were in effect prior to the amendments made by the Affordable Care Act. In this proposed rule, we are proposing to make conforming changes to the existing regulations text at \u00a7 412.101 to reflect the extension of the changes to the qualifying criteria and the payment adjustment methodology for low-volume hospitals through FY 2013 in accordance with section 605 of the ATRA, as announced in the FY 2013 IPPS notice (as discussed above). Specifically, we are proposing to revise paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), (c)(1), (c)(2), and (d). Under these proposed changes to \u00a7 412.101, beginning with FY 2014, consistent with section 1886(d)(12) of the Act, as amended, the low-volume hospital qualifying criteria and payment adjustment methodology would revert to that which was in effect prior to the amendments made by the Affordable Care Act and the ATRA (that is, the low-volume hospital payment adjustment policy in effect for FYs 2005 through 2010)., 496082=We received a request to evaluate the MS-DRG assignment of ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes V64.00 through V64.04, and V64.06 through V64.43 in MS-DRG 794 (Neonate with Other Significant Problems) under MDC 15. The requestor noted that the assignment of diagnosis code V64.05 (Vaccination not carried out because of caregiver refusal) was addressed in the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (75 FR 50111 through 50112). We removed diagnosis code V64.05 from MS-DRG 794 and added it to the \u201conly secondary diagnosis\u201d list for MS-DRG 795 (Normal Newborn). The requestor asked that we consider the reassignment of these diagnosis codes from MS-DRG 794 to MS-DRG 795. The codes under existing MS-DRG 794 include:, 561923=The ICD-10 coding system includes the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) for diagnosis coding and the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) for inpatient hospital procedure coding, as well as the Official ICD-10-CM and ICM-10-PCS Guidelines for Coding and Reporting. In the January 16, 2009 ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS final rule (74 FR 3328 through 3362), there was a discussion of the need for a partial or total freeze in the annual updates to both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS codes. The public comment addressed in that final rule stated that the annual code set updates should cease l year prior to the implementation of ICD-10. The commenters stated that this freeze of code updates would allow for instructional and/or coding software programs to be designed and purchased early, without concern that an upgrade would take place immediately before the compliance date, necessitating additional updates and purchases., 556077=A discussion of this timeline and the need for changes are included in the December 4-5, 2005 ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee Meeting minutes. The public agreed that there was a need to hold the fall meetings earlier, in September or October, in order to meet the new implementation dates. The public provided comment that additional time would be needed to update hospital systems and obtain new code books and coding software. There was considerable concern expressed about the impact this new April update would have on providers., 362578=If, based on a retroactive evaluation of claims data, the Secretary determines that implementation of the MS-DRG system resulted in changes in documentation and coding that did not reflect real changes in case-mix for discharges occurring during FY 2008 or FY 2009 that are different from the prospective documentation and coding adjustments applied under section 7(a) of Public Law 110-90, section 7(b)(1)(B) of Public Law 110-90 requires the Secretary to make an additional adjustment to the standardized amounts under section 1886(d) of the Act. This adjustment must offset the estimated increase or decrease in aggregate payments for FYs 2008 and 2009 (including interest) resulting from the difference between the estimated actual documentation and coding effect and the documentation and coding adjustment applied under section 7(a) of Public Law 110-90. This adjustment is in addition to making an appropriate adjustment to the standardized amounts under section 1886(d)(3)(A)(vi) of the Act as required by section 7(b)(1)(A) of Public Law 110-90. That is, these adjustments are intended to recoup (or repay, in the case of underpayments) spending in excess of (or less than) spending that would have occurred had the prospective adjustments for changes in documentation and coding applied in FY 2008 and FY 2009 precisely matched the changes that occurred in those years. Public Law 110-90 requires that the Secretary only make these recoupment or repayment adjustments for discharges occurring during FYs 2010, 2011, and 2012., 232570=A. Proposed Inpatient Hospital Updates for FY 2014 (\u00a7\u00a7 412.64(d) and 412.211(c)), 836296=After reviewing requested changes submitted by hospitals, fiscal intermediaries/MACs were required to transmit any additional revisions resulting from the hospitals' reconsideration requests by April 10, 2013. The deadline for a hospital to request CMS intervention in cases where the hospital disagreed with the fiscal intermediary's (or, if applicable, the MAC's) policy interpretations was April 17, 2013., 749365=Using the FY 2014 Table 10 thresholds, the case-weighted threshold for MS-DRGs 250 and 251 was $63,097 (all calculations above were performed using unrounded numbers). Because the inflated case-weighted average standardized charge per case for the applicable MS-DRGs for both approaches discussed above exceeds the case-weighted threshold amount, the applicant maintained that the MitraClip\u00ae System would meet the cost criterion., 188363=b. 7500 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21244-1850., 711432=In the second analysis, which the applicant characterizes as supplementary, the applicant searched the FY 2011 MedPAR file for cases reporting the combination of ICD-9-CM procedures codes 02.93 (Implantation or replacement of intracranial neurostimulator lead(s)) and 86.95 (Insertion or replacement of multiple array neurostimulator pulse generator, not specified as rechargeable), or the combination of ICD-9-CM procedures codes 02.93 (Implantation or replacement of intracranial neurostimulator lead(s)) and 01.20 (Cranial implantation or replacement of neurostimulator pulse generator) that mapped to MS-DRG 024., 186204=1. Electronically. You may submit electronic comments on this regulation at http://www.regulations.gov. Follow the instructions for \u201cComment or Submission\u201d and enter the file code CMS-1599-P to submit comments on this proposed rule., 229004=F. Proposed Occupational Mix Adjustment to the Proposed FY 2014 Wage Index, 794924=As stated earlier, section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act provides for the collection of data every 3 years on the occupational mix of employees for each short-term, acute care hospital participating in the Medicare program, in order to construct an occupational mix adjustment to the wage index, for application beginning October 1, 2004 (the FY 2005 wage index). The purpose of the occupational mix adjustment is to control for the effect of hospitals' employment choices on the wage index. For example, hospitals may choose to employ different combinations of registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, nursing aides, and medical assistants for the purpose of providing nursing care to their patients. The varying labor costs associated with these choices reflect hospital management decisions rather than geographic differences in the costs of labor., 456032=New technology add-on payments were limited to cases involving prolonged air leaks following lobectomy, segmentectomy, and LVRS in MS-DRGs 163, 164, and 165 in the FY 2010 IPPS/RY 2010 LTCH PPS final rule (74 FR 43823). This limitation was based on the indications for use approved by the FDA in the FDA Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) approval process set forth in section 520(m) of the Federal Food, Drug Cosmetic Act. A humanitarian use device (HUD) is a device that is intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects or is manifested in fewer than 4,000 individuals in the United States per year. Devices that receive HUD designation may be eligible for marketing approval, subject to certain restrictions, under an HDE application. To obtain marketing approval for an HUD, an HDE application must be submitted to the FDA. An HDE application is a premarket approval (PMA) application submitted to the FDA under 21 CFR 814.104 that seeks exemption from the PMA requirement under 21 CFR 814.20 demonstrating a reasonable assurance of effectiveness. A device that has received HUD designation may receive HDE approval if, among other things, the FDA determines that the device will not expose patients to an unreasonable or significant risk of illness or injury and the probable benefit to health from use of the device outweighs the risk of injury or illness from its use, taking into account the probable risks and benefits of currently available devices or alternative forms of treatment. In addition, the applicant must demonstrate that no comparable devices are available to treat or diagnose the disease or condition (other than another device approved under an HDE application or a device under an approved Investigational Device Exemption), and that the device would not otherwise be available unless an HDE is granted. An approved HDE authorizes marketing of the HUD. However, an HUD generally may be used in facilities only after prior approval by an Institutional Review Board (IRB)., 235820=b. Proposed Refinement of the Readmission Measures and Related Methodology for FY 2014 and Subsequent Years Payment Determinations, 805725=We compared the proposed FY 2014 occupational mix adjusted wage indices for each CBSA to the proposed unadjusted wage indices for each CBSA. As a result of applying the proposed occupational mix adjustment to the wage data, the proposed wage index values for 204 (52.2 percent) urban areas and 32 (66.7 percent) rural areas would increase. One hundred and eighteen (30.2 percent) urban areas would increase by 1 percent or more, and 4 (1.02 percent) urban areas would increase by 5 percent or more. Thirteen (27.1 percent) rural areas would increase by 1 percent or more, and no rural areas would increase by 5 percent or more. However, the proposed wage index values for 186 (47.6 percent) urban areas and 16 (33.3 percent) rural areas would decrease. Seventy-nine (20.2 percent) urban areas would decrease by 1 percent or more, and 1 urban area would decrease by 5 percent or more (0.26 percent). Seven (14.6 percent) rural areas would decrease by 1 percent or more, and no rural areas would decrease by 5 percent or more. The largest positive impacts are 6.61 percent for an urban area and 2.66 percent for a rural area. The largest negative impacts are 5.28 percent for an urban area and 3.17 percent for a rural area. One urban area's wage index, but no rural area wage indices, would remain unchanged by application of the proposed occupational mix adjustment. These results indicate that a larger percentage of rural areas (66.7 percent) would benefit from the proposed occupational mix adjustment than would urban areas (52.2 percent). However, approximately one-third (33.3 percent) of rural CBSAs would still experience a decrease in their proposed wage indices as a result of the proposed occupational mix adjustment., 622136=The Bundled Payments for Care Improvement (BPCI) initiative, developed under the authority of section 3021 of the Affordable Care Act (codified at section 1115A of the Act), is comprised of four broadly defined models of care, which link payments for multiple services beneficiaries receive during an episode of care. Under the BPCI initiative, organizations enter into payment arrangements that include financial and performance accountability for episodes of care. On January 31, 2013, CMS announced the health care organizations selected to participate in the BPCI initiative. For additional information on the BPCI initiative, we refer readers to the CMS' Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation's Web site at http://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/Bundled-Payments/index.html and to section IV.H.4. of the preamble of the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 53341 through 53343) for a discussion on the BPCI initiative., 355205=For general information about the MS-DRG system, including yearly reviews and changes to the MS-DRGs, we refer readers to the previous discussions in the FY 2010 IPPS/RY 2010 LTCH PPS final rule (74 FR 43764 through 43766), the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (75 FR 50053 through 50055), the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (76 FR 51485 through 51487), and the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 53273)., 229515=G. Analysis and Implementation of the Proposed Occupational Mix Adjustment and the Proposed FY 2014 Occupational Mix Adjusted Wage Index, 187290=Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Department of Health and Human Services, Attention: CMS-1599-P, Mail Stop C4-26-05, 7500 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21244-1850., 925956=For building and fixed equipment vintage weights, we used the real annual capital purchase amounts for building and fixed equipment to capture the actual amount of the physical acquisition, net of the effect of price inflation. This real annual purchase amount for building and fixed equipment was produced by deflating the nominal annual purchase amount by the building and fixed equipment price proxy, BEA's chained price index for nonresidential construction for hospitals and special care facilities. Because building and fixed equipment have an expected life of 26 years, the vintage weights for building and fixed equipment are deemed to represent the average purchase pattern of building and fixed equipment over 26-year periods. With real building and fixed equipment purchase estimates available back to 1963, we averaged twenty-two 26-year periods to determine the average vintage weights for building and fixed equipment that are representative of average building and fixed equipment purchase patterns over time. Vintage weights for each 26-year period are calculated by dividing the real building and fixed capital purchase amount in any given year by the total amount of purchases in the 26-year period. This calculation is done for each year in the 26-year period, and for each of the twenty-two 26-year periods. We used the average of each year across the twenty-two 26-year periods to determine the average building and fixed equipment vintage weights for the proposed FY 2010-based CIPI., 262021=2. Application of the Payment Update Reduction for Failure to Report for the FY 2014 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years, 995299=In the FY 2004 IPPS proposed rule (68 FR 27208) in response to questions about whether the patient days associated with patients enrolled in a Medicare + Choice (M+C) plan [now Medicare Advantage (MA) plan under Medicare Part C] should be counted in the Medicare fraction or the Medicaid fraction of the disproportionate patient percentage (DPP) calculation, we proposed that once a beneficiary enrolls in an M+C plan, those patient days attributable to the beneficiary would not be included in the Medicare fraction of the DPP. Instead, those patient days would be included in the numerator of the Medicaid fraction, if the patient also were eligible for Medicaid. In the FY 2004 IPPS final rule (68 FR 45422), we did not respond to public comments on this proposal, due to the volume and nature of the public comments we received, and we indicated that we would address those comments later in a separate document. In the FY 2005 IPPS proposed rule (69 FR 28286), we stated that we planned to address the FY 2004 comments regarding M+C days in the IPPS final rule for FY 2005. In the FY 2005 IPPS final rule (69 FR 49099), we determined that, under \u00a7 412.106(b)(2)(i) of the regulations, MA patient days should be counted in the Medicare fraction of the DPP calculation. We explained that, even where Medicare beneficiaries elect Medicare Part C coverage, they are still entitled to benefits under Medicare Part A. Therefore, we noted that if a Medicare M+C beneficiary is also an SSI recipient, the patient days for that beneficiary will be included in the numerator of the Medicare fraction (as well as in the denominator) and not in the numerator of the Medicaid fraction. We note that, despite our explicit statement in the final rule that the regulations also would be revised, due to a clerical error, the corresponding regulation at \u00a7 412.106(b)(2)(i) was not amended to explicitly reflect this policy until 2007 (72 FR 47384)., 629245=Under the third criterion, \u00a7 412.87(b)(1) of our existing regulations provides that a new technology is an appropriate candidate for an additional payment when it represents \u201can advance that substantially improves, relative to technologies previously available, the diagnosis or treatment of Medicare beneficiaries.\u201d For example, a new technology represents a substantial clinical improvement when it reduces mortality, decreases the number of hospitalizations or physician visits, or reduces recovery time compared to the technologies previously available. (We refer readers to the September 7, 2001 final rule for a more detailed discussion of this criterion (66 FR 46902).), 253342=d. Proposed Data Submission Requirements for Quality Measures That May be Voluntarily Electronically Reported for the FY 2016 Payment Determination, 752169=Using the FY 2014 Table 10 thresholds, the case-weighted threshold for MS-DRGs 250 and 251 was $61,896 (all calculations above were performed using unrounded numbers). Because the inflated case-weighted average standardized charge per case for the applicable MS-DRGs for both charge inflation approaches discussed above exceeds the case-weighted threshold amount, the applicant maintained that the MitraClip\u00ae System would meet the cost criterion., 74669=We are proposing to update the payment policies and the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) and implement certain statutory changes made by the Affordable Care Act. Generally, these proposed changes would be applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2013, unless otherwise specified in this proposed rule., 230591=a. FY 2014 Reclassification Requirements and Approvals, 220298=b. Recoupment or Repayment Adjustments in FYs 2010 through 2012 Required by Section 7(b)(1)(B) Public Law 110-90, 441622=We examined claims data from the FY 2012 MedPAR file for heart and liver transplant cases assigned to MS-DRGs 001, 002, 005, and 006. The following table illustrates our findings:, 348198=In section VIII. of the preamble of this proposed rule, we set forth proposed changes to the payment rates, factors, and other payment rate policies under the LTCH PPS for FY 2014. We also note that the moratorium on the full implementation of the \u201c25-percent threshold\u201d payment adjustment will expire for certain cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2013. In addition, in this section, we describe the results of research being done by Kennell and Associates (Kennell) and its subcontractor, Research Triangle Institute, International (RTI), under a contract with CMS on the development of a payment adjustment under the LTCH PPS based on the establishment of LTCH patient criteria., 565270=The ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee announced that it would continue to meet twice a year during the freeze. At these meetings, the public will be encouraged to comment on whether or not requests for new diagnosis and procedure codes should be created based on the need to capture new technology and new diseases. Any code requests that do not meet the criteria will be evaluated for implementation within ICD-10 on or after October 1, 2015, once the partial freeze is ended., 238208=c. Proposed Experience of Care Domain Performance Period and Baseline Period for the FY 2016 Hospital VBP Program, 839278=After the release of the May 2013 wage index data files, changes to the wage and occupational mix data will only be made in those very limited situations involving an error by the fiscal intermediary/MAC or CMS that the hospital could not have known about before its review of the final wage index data files. Specifically, neither the fiscal intermediary/MAC nor CMS will approve the following types of requests:, 800999=In the FY 2011 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule and final rule (75 FR 23943 and 75 FR 50167, respectively), we stated that, in order to gain a better understanding of why some hospitals are not submitting the occupational mix data, we will require hospitals that do not submit occupational mix data to provide an explanation for not complying. This requirement was effective beginning with the 2010 occupational mix survey. We instructed fiscal intermediaries/MACs to continue gathering this information as part of the FY 2014 wage index desk review process. We will review these data for future analysis and consideration of potential penalties for noncompliant hospitals., 438724=In this FY 2014 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule, we are inviting public comment on each of the MS-DRG classification proposed changes described below, as well as our proposals to maintain certain existing MS-DRG classifications, which also are discussed below. In some cases, we are proposing changes to the MS-DRG classifications based on our analysis of claims data. In other cases, we are proposing to maintain the existing MS-DRG classification based on our analysis of claims data., 668766=According to the applicant, the technology is eligible to be used across all MS-DRGs. To demonstrate that it meets the cost criterion, the applicant searched the FY 2011 MedPAR file (across all MS DRGs) for cases reporting a primary or secondary diagnosis of E934.2 (Adverse events due to anticoagulants), V58.61 (Long term (current) use of anticoagulants), or 964.2 (Poisoning by anticoagulants) in combination with procedure code 99.07 (Transfusion of the serum). The applicant believed that this combination identified cases that suggest the use of a Vitamin K antagonist therapy as well as a major bleed., 298583=In section VIII.A. of the preamble of this proposed rule, we present the proposed LTCH PPS standard Federal rate for FY 2014, which includes a proposed adjustment factor of 0.98734 for the second year of the 3-year phase-in of the permanent one-time adjustment to the standard Federal rate. In addition, under the LTCH Quality Reporting (LTCHQR) Program, the proposed annual update to the standard Federal rate will be reduced by 2 percentage points for LTCHs that fail to submit data for FY 2014 on specific measures under section 3004 of the Affordable Care Act., 910996=Using the proposed FY 2010-based Puerto Rico cost category weights, we calculated a labor-related share of 63.157 percent, approximately 1.1 percentage points higher than the current Puerto-Rico specific labor-related share of 62.087. Accordingly, we are proposing to adopt an updated Puerto Rico labor-related share of 63.2 percent., 263069=8. Proposed Public Display Requirements for the FY 2014 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years, 663188=CSL Behring submitted an application for new technology add-on payments for Kcentra TM for FY 2014. Kcentra TM is a replacement therapy for fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for patients with an acquired coagulation factor deficiency due to warfarin and who are experiencing a severe bleed. Kcentra TM contains the Vitamin K dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX and X, together known as the prothrombin complex, and antithrombotic proteins C and S. Factor IX is the lead factor for the potency of the preparation. The product is a heat-treated, non-activated, virus filtered and lyophilized plasma protein concentrate made from pooled human plasma. Kcentra TM is available as a lyophilized powder that needs to be reconstituted with sterile water prior to administration via intravenous infusion. The product is dosed based on Factor IX units. Concurrent Vitamin K treatment is recommended to maintain blood clotting factor levels once the effects of Kcentra TM have diminished., 372239=In the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 53274 through 53276), we completed the prospective portion of the adjustment required under section 7(b)(1)(A) of Public Law 110-90 by finalizing a \u22121.9 percent adjustment to the standardized amount for FY 2013. We stated that this adjustment would remove the remaining effect of the documentation and coding changes that do not reflect real changes in case-mix that occurred in FY 2008 and FY 2009. We believe it was imperative to implement the full remaining adjustment, as any further delay would result in an overstated standardized amount in FY 2013 and any future years until a full adjustment is made., 725107=Cook\u00ae Medical submitted an application for new technology add-on payments for the Zilver\u00ae PTX\u00ae Drug Eluting Peripheral Stent (Zilver\u00ae PTX\u00ae) for FY 2014. The Zilver\u00ae PTX\u00ae is intended for use in the treatment of peripheral artery disease (PAD) of the above-the-knee femoropopliteal arteries (superficial femoral arteries). According to the applicant, the stent is percutaneously inserted into the artery(s), usually by accessing the common femoral artery in the groin. The applicant stated that an introducer catheter is inserted over the wire guide and into the target vessel where the lesion will first be treated with an angioplasty balloon to prepare the vessel for stenting. The applicant indicated that the stent is self-expanding, made of nitinol (nickel titanium), and is coated with the drug Paclitaxel. Paclitaxel is a drug approved for use as an anticancer agent and for use with coronary stents to reduce the risk of renarrowing of the coronary arteries after stenting procedures., 774629=Section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act requires that, as part of the methodology for determining prospective payments to hospitals, the Secretary must adjust the standardized amounts \u201cfor area differences in hospital wage levels by a factor (established by the Secretary) reflecting the relative hospital wage level in the geographic area of the hospital compared to the national average hospital wage level.\u201d We currently define hospital labor market areas based on the delineations of statistical areas established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). A discussion of the proposed FY 2014 hospital wage index based on the statistical areas appears under section III.B. of the preamble of this proposed rule., 560774=The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) coding system applicable to hospital inpatient services was to be implemented on October 1, 2013, as described in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Administrative Simplification: Modifications to Medical Data Code Set Standards to Adopt ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS final rule (74 FR 3328 through 3362, January 16, 2009). However, the Secretary of Health and Human Services issued a final rule that delays, from October 1, 2013, to October 1, 2014, the compliance date for the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition diagnosis and procedure codes (ICD-10). The final rule, CMS-0040-F, was published in the Federal Register on September 5, 2012 (77 FR 54664) and is available for viewing on the Internet at: http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-09-05/pdf/2012-21238.pdf., 1004774=In addition to this payment, section 1886(r)(2) of the Act provides that, for fiscal year 2014 and each subsequent fiscal year, the Secretary shall pay to \u201csuch subsection (d) hospital an additional amount equal to the product of\u201d three factors. The first factor is the difference between \u201cthe aggregate amount of payments that would be made to subsection (d) hospitals under subsection (d)(5)(F) if this subsection did not apply\u201d and \u201cthe aggregate amount of payments that are made to subsection (d) hospitals under paragraph (1)\u201d for each fiscal year. Therefore, this factor amounts to 75 percent of the payments that would otherwise be made under section 1886(d)(5)(F) of the Act., 219380=1. Background on the Prospective MS-DRG Documentation and Coding Adjustments for FY 2008 and FY 2009 Authorized by Public Law 110-90, 1006713=For FY 2018 and subsequent years, the second factor is 1 minus the percent change in the percent of individuals who are uninsured, as determined by comparing the percent of individuals \u201cwho are uninsured in 2013 (as estimated by the Secretary, based on data from the Census Bureau or other sources the Secretary determines appropriate, and certified by the Chief Actuary\u201d of CMS, and \u201cwho are uninsured in the most recent period for which data is available (as so estimated and certified) minus 0.2 percentage points for FYs 2018 and 2019.\u201d Thus, for FY 2018 and subsequent years, the statute provides some greater flexibility in the choice of the data sources to be used in the estimate of the change in the percent of the uninsured., 239335=b. Proposed Domain Weighting for the FY 2016 Hospital VBP Program for Hospitals That Receive a Score on All Domains, 242584=2. Proposed FY 2014 Budget Neutrality Offset Amount}",
    "textBeforeTable": "For comparison purposes, the following table shows the final FY 2013 CCRs, the potential FY 2014 CCRs computed with the existing 15 cost centers, and the potential FY 2014 CCRs computed with 19 cost centers, with 4 new CCRs for implantable devices, MRIs, CT scans, and cardiac catheterization. We believe that there is a sufficient amount of data in the FY 2011 cost reports from which to generate a meaningful analysis of using distinct CCRs for implantable devices, MRIs, CT scans, and cardiac catheterization. In addition, the corresponding charge data on hospital claims for implantable devices, MRIs, CT scans, and cardiac catheterization are available in the FY 2012 MedPAR file. Therefore, we are providing various data analyses below based on comparison of the FY 2014 relative weights computed using 15 CCRs, as we have done in the past, and the FY 2014 relative weights computed using 19 CCRs, with distinct CCRs for implantable devices, MRIs, CT scans, and cardiac catheterization. Specifically, rather than having a single CCR for \u201cSupplies and Equipment\u201d which includes low-cost supplies and high-cost implantable devices, a distinct CCR would be carved out of the \u201cSupplies and Equipment\u201d CCR, leaving one CCR for \u201cSupplies\u201d and one CCR for \u201cImplantable Devices.\u201d Regarding the Radiology CCR, which currently is comprised of general radiology ancillary services and MRIs and CT scans, the costs for MRIs and CT scans would be separated from general radiology, creating two distinct CCRs, one for MRIs and one for",

Overall, if 19 CCRs are used to calculate the relative weights for FY 2014, relative weights for medical MS-DRGs would be expected to decrease by approximately 1.1 percent, and those for surgical MS-DRGs would be expected to increase by approximately 1.2 percent. In addition, as shown in the table below, at the MDC level, payments would increase by approximately 0.64 percent (0.39 + 0.25) within orthopedic and cardiac MDCs, with most of the reductions in payment resulting to the medical MS-DRGs in the nervous system, digestive system, and respiratory system MDCs. MDC Description Estimated percentage change within MDC (percent) 08 Musculoskeletal System and Connective Tissue 0.39 05 Circulatory System 0.25 01 Nervous System \u22120.16 06 Digestive System \u22120.10 04 Respiratory System \u22120.08 The largest estimated increase in MS-DRG relative weights would likely occur for MS-DRGs associated with cardiac catheterization and implantable cardiac devices. The largest estimated reductions in MS-DRG relative weights would likely occur for MS-DRGs associated with",
