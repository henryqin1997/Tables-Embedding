    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{14590=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are issuing this final rule to comply with court orders that reinstate the regulatory protections under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (ESA), for the gray wolf (Canis lupus) in Wyoming and the western Great Lakes. Pursuant to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia court order dated September 23, 2014, this rule reinstates the April 2, 2009 (74 FR 15123), final rule regulating the gray wolf in the State of Wyoming as a nonessential experimental population. Gray wolves in Montana, Idaho, the eastern third of Washington and Oregon, and north-central Utah retain their delisted status and are not impacted by this final rule. In addition, pursuant to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia court order dated December 19, 2014, this rule reinstates the March 9, 1978 (43 FR 9607), final rule as it relates to gray wolves in the western Great Lakes including endangered status for gray wolves in all of Wisconsin and Michigan, the eastern half of North Dakota and South Dakota, the northern half of Iowa, the northern portions of Illinois and Indiana, and the northwestern portion of Ohio; threatened status for gray wolves in Minnesota; critical habitat for gray wolves in Minnesota and Michigan; and the rule promulgated under section 4(d) of the ESA for gray wolves in Minnesota., 82622=\u00a7 4241 - Relationship to Endangered Species Act of 1973, 78908=\u00a7 1386 - Stock assessments, 80377=\u00a7 1534 - Land acquisition, 78071=\u00a7 1380 - Marine mammal research grants, 105370=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce 90-day findings on various petitions to list eight species, reclassify one species, and delist one species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Based on our review, we find that these 10 petitions present substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned actions may be warranted. Therefore, with the publication of this document, we are initiating a review of the status of each of these species to determine if the petitioned actions are warranted. The status reviews for two species, the golden conure (which appears in the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife as the golden parakeet) and the northern spotted owl, will also serve as 5-year reviews for those species. To ensure that these status reviews are comprehensive, we are requesting scientific and commercial data and other information regarding these species. Based on the status reviews, we will issue 12-month findings on the petitions, which will address whether the petitioned action is warranted, as provided in section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act., 80932=\u00a7 1539 - Exceptions, 234273=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, are extending the comment period for our October 7, 2014, proposed rule to list the West Coast distinct population segment (DPS) of fisher ( Pekania pennanti ) as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. This action ensures the public has an additional opportunity to comment on the proposal., 287809=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce a proposed rule and a 12-month finding on a petition to list the African lion ( Panthera leo leo ) as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). After review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the subspecies Panthera leo leo as threatened is warranted, and we propose to list the subspecies as threatened. We are also proposing a rule under section 4(d) of the Act to provide for conservation measures for the African lion. To ensure that subsequent rulemaking resulting from this proposed rule is as accurate and effective as possible, we are soliciting information from the scientific community; other governmental agencies, including those within the range of the African lion; nongovernmental organizations; the public; and any other interested parties., 80248=\u00a7 1533 - Determination of endangered species and threatened species, 94306=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the reopening of the public comment period on the January 25, 2013, proposed designation of critical habitat for the Zuni bluehead sucker ( Catostomus discobolus yarrowi ) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). We also announce the availability of the draft economic analysis, draft environmental assessment, and amended required determinations of the proposed designation. In addition, we are proposing revisions to the proposed critical habitat boundaries that would decrease our total proposed critical habitat designation for the Zuni bluehead sucker from approximately 475.3 kilometers (291.3 miles) to approximately 228.4 kilometers (141.9 miles). We are reopening the comment period to allow all interested parties an opportunity to comment simultaneously on the revisions to the proposed critical habitat designation described in this document, the associated draft economic analysis and draft environmental assessment, and the amended required determinations section. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted, as they will be fully considered in preparation of the final rule., 80464=\u00a7 1535 - Cooperation with States, 77370=\u00a7 1374 - Permits, 76829=\u00a7 1361 - Congressional findings and declaration of policy, 76948=\u00a7 1362 - Definitions, 81197=\u00a7 1542 - Authorization of appropriations, 80846=\u00a7 1538 - Prohibited acts, 149942=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), published a proposed rule in the Federal Register on March 11, 2015, to designate critical habitat for the black pinesnake ( Pituophis melanoleucus lodingi ) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). In that proposed rule, we provided the wrong address for the submission of hard-copy comments. With this document, we correct our error., 182718=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, published a 90-day finding in the Federal Register on August 19, 2014, determining that a petition to list the island marble butterfly ( Euchloe ausonides insulanus ) as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, presented substantial information indicating listing may be warranted. We promptly initiated a status review and requested information on the species from any interested parties. We made an error in the requested deadline for information submission. With this document, we correct the error., 138447=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the reopening of the public comment period on our May 8, 2014, proposed rule to amend the listing of the southern Selkirk Mountains population of woodland caribou ( Rangifer tarandus caribou ) to the Southern Mountain caribou distinct population segment (DPS). The southern Selkirk Mountains population of woodland caribou is currently listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). On May 8, 2014, we proposed to list the Southern Mountain caribou DPS as threatened under the Act. This reopening of comment period will provide all interested parties with an opportunity to review additional scientific information and provide comment on the status of the Southern Mountain caribou DPS. Information previously submitted need not be resubmitted as it has already been incorporated into the public record and will be fully considered in the final listing determination., 69949=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine threatened status for the straight-horned markhor ( Capra falconeri megaceros ), under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). We are also publishing a concurrent rule under section 4(d) of the Act. This rule protects and conserves the straight-horned markhor, while encouraging local communities to conserve additional populations of the straight-horned markhor through sustainable-use management programs., 59599=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), in accordance with the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), are amending the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife (List) by adding 20 species of corals: Boulder star coral ( Orbicella franksi ), lobed star coral ( Orbicella annularis ), mountainous star coral ( Orbicella faveolata ), pillar coral ( Dendrogyra cylindrus ), rough cactus coral ( Mycetophyllia ferox ), Acropora globiceps, Acropora jacquelineae, Acropora lokani, Acropora pharaonis, Acropora retusa, Acropora rudis, Acropora speciosa, Acropora tenella, Anacropora spinosa, Euphyllia paradivisa, Isopora crateriformis, Montipora australiensis, Pavona diffluens, Porites napopora, and Seriatopora aculeata. These amendments are based on previously published determinations by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce, which has jurisdiction for these species., 79362=\u00a7 1401 - Establishment, 81424=\u00a7 1544 - Annual cost analysis by Fish and Wildlife Service, 81299=\u00a7 1543 - Construction with Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, 79658=\u00a7 1404 - Omitted, 79537=\u00a7 1403 - Committee of Scientific Advisors on Marine Mammals, 78996=\u00a7 1387 - Taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations, 78819=\u00a7 1385 - Dolphin protection, 78279=\u00a7 1382 - Regulations and administration, 187758=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), published a proposed rule in the Federal Register on January 16, 2015, to set forth a species-specific rule under the authority of section 4(d) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), that provides measures that are necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of the northern long-eared bat ( Myotis septentrionalis ), should we determine this species warrants listing as a threatened species under the Act. In that proposal, we provided the wrong address for the submission of hard-copy comments. With this document, we correct our error., 77448=\u00a7 1375 - Penalties, 79252=\u00a7 1389 - Pacific Coast Task Force; Gulf of Maine, 79135=\u00a7 1388 - Marine mammal cooperative agreements in Alaska, 3791=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine threatened species status under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended, for the northern long-eared bat ( Myotis septentrionalis ), a bat species that occurs in 37 States, the District of Columbia, and 13 Canadian Provinces. The effect of this final rule will be to add the northern long-eared bat to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. We are also establishing an interim rule under the authority of section 4(d) of the Act that provides measures that are necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of the northern long-eared bat. We are seeking public comments on this interim rule, and we will publish either an affirmation of the interim rule or a final rule amending the interim rule after we consider all comments we receive. If you previously submitted comments or information on the proposed 4(d) rule we published on January 16, 2015, please do not resubmit them. We have incorporated them into the public record, and we will fully consider them in our final determination on the 4(d) rule., 78171=\u00a7 1381 - Commercial fisheries gear development, 78717=\u00a7 1384 - Authorization of appropriations, 88636=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), withdraw the proposed rule to list the bi-State distinct population segment (DPS) of greater sage-grouse ( Centrocercus urophasianus ) in California and Nevada as threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), as well as the proposed rules under section 4(d) of the Act and to designate critical habitat for the bi-State DPS of greater sage-grouse. These withdrawals are based on our conclusion that the threats to the DPS as identified in the proposed listing rule no longer are as significant as believed at the time of publication of the proposed rule. We find the best scientific and commercial data available indicate that the threats to the DPS and its habitat, given current and future conservation efforts, are reduced below the statutory definition of threatened or endangered. Therefore, we are withdrawing our proposal to list the bi-State DPS of greater sage-grouse as threatened with critical habitat., 45371=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine threatened species status under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended, for the rufa red knot ( Calidris canutus rufa ). The rufa red knot is a migratory shorebird that breeds in the Canadian Arctic, winters in parts of the United States, the Caribbean, and South America, and primarily uses well-known spring and fall stopover areas on the Atlantic coast of the United States, although some follow a midcontinental migratory route. The effect of this regulation will be to add this species to the list of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife., 303727=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, propose to list Trichomanes punctatum ssp. floridanum (Florida bristle fern), a plant subspecies from Miami-Dade and Sumter Counties in Florida, as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would extend the Act's protections to this plant and add this plant to the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Plants., 244118=In this Candidate Notice of Review (CNOR), we, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), present an updated list of plant and animal species native to the United States that we regard as candidates for or have proposed for addition to the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. Identification of candidate species can assist environmental planning efforts by providing advance notice of potential listings, allowing landowners and resource managers to alleviate threats and thereby possibly remove the need to list species as endangered or threatened. Even if we subsequently list a candidate species, the early notice provided here could result in more options for species management and recovery by prompting candidate conservation measures to alleviate threats to the species. The CNOR summarizes the status and threats that we evaluated in order to determine that species qualify as candidates, to assign a listing priority number (LPN) to each species, and to determine whether a species should be removed from candidate status. Additional material that we relied on is available in the Species Assessment and Listing Priority Assignment Forms (species assessment forms) for each candidate species. Overall, this CNOR recognizes 23 new candidates, changes the LPN for one candidate, and removes one species from candidate status. Combined with other decisions for individual species that were published separately from this CNOR in the past year, the current number of species that are candidates for listing is 146. This document also includes our findings on resubmitted petitions and describes our progress in revising the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants (Lists) during the period October 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014. We request additional status information that may be available for the 146 candidate species identified in this CNOR., 77876=\u00a7 1378 - International program, 77692=\u00a7 1376 - Seizure and forfeiture of cargo, 177349=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the reopening of the public comment period on our February 13, 2014, proposed rule to remove the Modoc sucker ( Catostomus microps ) from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. This action allows us to accept and consider additional public comments on the proposed rule. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted, as they will be fully considered in preparation of the final listing determination., 99712=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce a 6-month extension of the final determination of whether to list the West Coast distinct population segment (DPS) of fisher ( Pekania pennanti ) as a threatened species. We also reopen the comment period on the proposed rule to list the species for an additional 30 days. We are taking this action based on substantial disagreement regarding available information related to toxicants and rodenticides (including law enforcement information and trend data) and related to surveyed versus unsurveyed areas (including data on negative survey results) to help assess distribution and population trends. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted as they are already incorporated into the public record and will be fully considered in the final rule. We will submit a final listing determination to the Federal Register on or before April 7, 2016., 50310=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine threatened species status under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), for the Gunnison sage-grouse ( Centrocercus minimus ), a bird species from southwestern Colorado and southeastern Utah. The effect of this regulation will be to add the Gunnison sage-grouse to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife., 80034=\u00a7 1531 - Congressional findings and declaration of purposes and policy, 79446=\u00a7 1402 - Duties of Commission, 282811=On August 15, 2014, we, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announced a proposal to designate critical habitat for the western distinct population segment of the yellow-billed cuckoo under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). We now announce a reopening of the comment period for our August 15, 2014, proposed rule to allow for us to accept and consider additional public comments on the proposed rule., 77794=\u00a7 1377 - Enforcement, 298458=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the reopening of the public comment period on our March 27, 2014, proposed rule to reclassify the arroyo toad ( Anaxyrus californicus ) as threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). We are taking this action to solicit feedback on new information we received. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted, as they will be fully considered in preparation of the final listing determination. We anticipate publishing a final determination on or before March 27, 2015., 80166=\u00a7 1532 - Definitions, 208478=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to create a species-specific rule under authority of section 4(d) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), that provides measures that are necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of the northern long-eared bat ( Myotis septentrionalis ), should we determine this species warrants listing as a threatened species under the Act. In addition, we announce the reopening of the public comment period on the October 2, 2013, proposed rule to list the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species under the Act., 77260=\u00a7 1373 - Regulations on taking of marine mammals, 81013=\u00a7 1540 - Penalties and enforcement, 80652=\u00a7 1537 - International cooperation, 79932=\u00a7 1407 - Authorization of appropriations, 126825=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce a 12-month finding on a petition to list the previously classified subspecies Humboldt marten ( Martes americana humboldtensis ), or the (now-recognized) subspecies of Humboldt marten ( Martes caurina humboldtensis ), or the Humboldt marten distinct population segment (DPS) of the Pacific marten ( M. caurina ) as an endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The petition and this finding also address populations of marten from coastal Oregon, which recent genetic analyses indicate are likely to be the same entity as the current classification of Humboldt marten. We recognize a coastal DPS of the Pacific marten (which includes coastal Oregon populations of marten and the current classification of Humboldt marten) and find that this DPS is not warranted for listing at this time. However, we ask the public to submit to us any new information that becomes available concerning the stressors that may be impacting the coastal DPS of Pacific marten or its habitat at any time., 35891=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine endangered status under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, for the Mexican wolf ( Canis lupus baileyi ). The effect of this regulation will be to revise the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife by making a separate entry for the Mexican wolf. We are separating our determination on the listing of the Mexican wolf as endangered from the determination on our proposal regarding the delisting of the gray wolf in the United States and Mexico. This rule finalizes our determination for the Mexican wolf., 116483=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, are amending our proposed rule under authority of section 4(d) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), that provides measures that are necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of the Georgetown salamander ( Eurycea naufragia ), a species that occurs in Texas. We are seeking public comments on this revised proposed rule. We also announce the availability of a draft environmental assessment of this revised proposed rule., 77030=\u00a7 1371 - Moratorium on taking and importing marine mammals and marine mammal products, 80558=\u00a7 1536 - Interagency cooperation, 79847=\u00a7 1406 - Administration, 64973=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine threatened species status under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended, for the Dakota skipper ( Hesperia dacotae ), a butterfly currently found in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan and endangered species status for the Poweshiek skipperling ( Oarisma poweshiek ), a butterfly currently found in Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Manitoba. The effect of this regulation will be to add these species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife., 77177=\u00a7 1372 - Prohibitions, 30748=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), in accordance with the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), are amending the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife (List) by adding five species of sawfish: Narrow sawfish ( Anoxypristis cuspidata ), dwarf sawfish ( Pristis clavata ), largetooth sawfish (collectively Pristis pristis; formerly Pristis pristis, Pristis microdon, and Pristis perotteti ), green sawfish ( Pristis zijsron ), and the non-U.S. distinct population segment (DPS) of smalltooth sawfish ( Pristis pectinata ). These amendments are based on previously published determinations by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce, which has jurisdiction for these species., 77968=\u00a7 1379 - Transfer of management authority, 110745=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), in coordination with the State of Wyoming and other partners, propose to reestablish additional populations of the black-footed ferret ( Mustela nigripes ), a federally listed endangered mammal, into occupied prairie dog ( Cynomys spp.) habitat in Wyoming. We propose to reestablish the black-footed ferret under section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), and to classify any reestablished population as a nonessential experimental population (NEP). This approach would provide relaxed management rules to facilitate reintroductions. We are seeking comments on this proposal and on our draft environmental assessment, prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (NEPA), which analyzes the potential environmental impacts associated with the proposed reintroduction. We are also notifying the public that we are amending the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife (List) to reflect the scientifically accepted historical range of the black-footed ferret. The revised historical range description includes Mexico. The historical range information in the List is informational, not regulatory., 223073=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), recently published a proposed listing for 21 plant and animal species from the Mariana Islands (U.S. Territory of Guam and the U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands) as endangered species and 2 plant species from the Mariana Islands as threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), and announced a 60-day public comment period on the proposed actions, ending December 1, 2014. We now reopen the public comment period for an additional 30 days, and announce two public hearings and four public information meetings on our proposed rule. We are taking these actions to allow all interested parties additional time and opportunity to comment on the proposed rule., 25701=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, published a final rule in the Federal Register on January 16, 2015, that revises the regulations for the nonessential experimental population of the Mexican wolf ( Canis lupus baileyi ). In that rule, we made an error in our description of Phase 2 by stating that dispersal and occupancy of Mexican wolves west of Interstate 17 will be limited to the area west of Highway 89 in Arizona. We intended to state that dispersal and occupancy of Mexican wolves west of Interstate 17 will be limited to the area east of Highway 89. With this document, we correct our error., 251059=On August 15, 2014, we, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announced a proposal to designate critical habitat for the western distinct population segment of the yellow-billed cuckoo (western yellow-billed cuckoo) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). On November 12, 2014, the public comment period was reopened for an additional 60 days until January 12, 2015. We now announce a public hearing in California. The public hearing will provide an opportunity for the public to provide comments and testimony on the proposed designation of critical habitat for the western yellow-billed cuckoo. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted, as they will be fully considered in preparation of the final rule., 155063=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to designate critical habitat for the black pinesnake ( Pituophis melanoleucus lodingi ) under the Endangered Species Act (Act). In total, approximately 338,100 acres (136,824 hectares) in Forrest, George, Greene, Harrison, Jones, Marion, Perry, Stone, and Wayne Counties, Mississippi, and in Clarke County, Alabama, fall within the boundaries of the proposed critical habitat designation. We also announce the availability of a draft economic analysis (DEA) of the proposed critical habitat designation. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would extend the Act's protections to this species' critical habitat. In addition, we announce the reopening of the public comment period on the October 7, 2014, proposed rule to list the black pinesnake as a threatened species under the Act. We are reopening the comment period to allow all interested parties an opportunity to comment simultaneously on the proposed listing rule as well as this proposed critical habitat rule and its associated DEA. Comments previously submitted on the proposed listing rule need not be resubmitted, as they will be fully considered in preparation of that final rule., 83383=Title 50 published on 2014-10-01, 81109=\u00a7 1541 - Endangered plants, 79736=\u00a7 1405 - Coordination with other Federal agencies, 20374=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are removing the Oregon chub ( Oregonichthys crameri ) from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. This determination is based on a thorough review of the best available scientific and commercial information, which indicates that the Oregon chub has recovered and no longer meets the definition of an endangered species or a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Our review of the status of this species shows that the threats to this species have been eliminated or reduced and populations are stable so that the species is not currently, and is not likely to again become, a threatened species within the foreseeable future in all or a significant portion of its range. This rule also removes the currently designated critical habitat for the Oregon chub throughout its range., 228716=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce 90-day findings on a petition to delist the coastal California gnatcatcher ( Polioptila californica californica ) and a petition to list the monarch butterfly ( Danaus plexippus plexippus ) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Based on our review, we find that both petitions present substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned actions may be warranted. Therefore, with the publication of this notice, we are initiating a review of the status of these subspecies to determine if the petitioned actions are warranted. To ensure that these status reviews are comprehensive, we are requesting scientific and commercial data and other information regarding these subspecies. Based on the status reviews, we will issue 12-month findings on the petitions, which will address whether the petitioned action is warranted, as provided in section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act., 271903=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the reopening of the comment period for our October 2, 2013, proposed rule to list the northern long-eared bat ( Myotis septentrionalis ) as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). We are taking this action to notify the public of new information that was supplied to us by, or on behalf of, State agencies within the range of the species. This reopening of the comment period will allow the public to provide comments on our proposed rule in light of that new information. We also are notifying the public that we have scheduled an informational meeting followed by a public hearing on the proposed rule. Comments previously submitted on the proposal need not be resubmitted, as they are already incorporated into the public record and will be fully considered in our final determination., 40482=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), revise the regulations for the nonessential experimental population of the Mexican wolf ( Canis lupus baileyi ) under section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. This action is being taken in coordination with our final rule in this Federal Register to list the Mexican wolf as an endangered subspecies. The regulatory revisions in this rule will improve the project to reintroduce a nonessential experimental population, thereby increasing potential for recovery of this species., 78380=\u00a7 1383 - Application to other treaties and conventions, 74855=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine threatened status under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended, for the western distinct population segment (DPS) of the yellow-billed cuckoo ( Coccyzus americanus ), a species located from the western portions of the United States, Canada, and Mexico. This final rule implements the Federal protections provided by the Act for this DPS., 256564=We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), make available the final environmental impact statement (EIS) on the proposed revisions to the regulations for the nonessential experimental population designation of the Mexican wolf and our draft record of decision (ROD), under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended. Our intended action is to revise the regulations established in our 1998 Final Rule for the nonessential experimental population of the Mexican wolf. We also propose to extend the authority of the Mexican Wolf Recovery Program's section 10(a)(1)(A) research and recovery permit to areas that are outside of the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area. In the EIS we analyzed the environmental consequences of a range of alternatives, including the Proposed Action and No Action alternative, for our proposed rule. The action would be implemented through a final rule, a revised section 10(a)(1)(A) research and recovery permit, and the provision of Federal funding.}",
