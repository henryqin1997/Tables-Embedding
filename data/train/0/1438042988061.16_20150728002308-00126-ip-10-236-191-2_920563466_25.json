See the documentation page for information on getting started and a comparison with the legacy commerce_file 1.x branch. Integrates with Amazon S3, allowing licensed files to be retrieved directly from Amazon, using a secret and temporary URL. The number of downloads / streams can be limited. Once the limit is reached, the file is listed, but can't be accessed. File licenses can be time limited, and are automatically expired (by cron) once that time passes. Licensed files can be downloaded or streamed from the user's Files tab. The \"License completion message\" checkout pane allows the customer to download the newly licensed files even if he is not logged in. Features Sponsored by Commerce Guys The user buys a product and gets access to all files attached to that product's commerce_file field. Adding new files to the commerce_file field (a new software version, for instance) makes them immediately available to all users who have an active license. Extends Commerce License with the ability to sell access to files.",
