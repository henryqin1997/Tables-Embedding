    "textAfterTable": "Filtering Print Files Print filters are programs on the print server that convert the content of a queued file from one format to another format. A print filter can be as simple or as complex as needed. The Oracle Solaris OS provides print filters in the /usr/lib/lp/postscript directory that cover most situations where the destination printer requires the data to be in PostScript format. If you need filters for non-PostScript printers, you have to create the filters and add them to the systems that need filters. A set of print filter descriptor files are provided in the /etc/lp/fd directory. These descriptor files describe the characteristics of the filter (for example, fast or slow filter). These description files point to the filter program (for example, to /usr/lib/lp/postscript/postdaisy). How the Printer Interface Program Works The LP print service interacts with other parts of the Oracle Solaris OS. The print service uses a standard printer interface program to do the following: Initialize the printer port, if necessary. The standard printer interface program uses the stty command to initialize the printer port. Initialize the printer. The standard printer interface program uses the terminfo database and the TERM shell variable to find the appropriate control sequences. Print a banner page, if necessary. Print the correct number of copies specified by the print request.",
