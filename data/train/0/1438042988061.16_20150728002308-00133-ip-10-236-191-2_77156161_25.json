BI Publisher supports Microsoft Word 2000 (or later) with Microsoft Windows version 2000 (or later)., 106191=For example, the following statement tests the AMOUNT element value. If the value is greater than 1000, show the word \"Higher\"; if it is less than 1000, show the word \"Lower\"; if it is equal to 1000, show \"Equal\":, 91665=http://myserver.domain:8888/CustomerReport/cstid=1234, 238163=For more information on XSL-FO see the W3C Website at http://www.w3.org/2002/08/XSLFOsummary.html, 66503=Microsoft Word 2000 Users: After you add the background map and overlay the shape group, use the Grouping dialog to make the entire composition one group., 66675=Microsoft Word 2002/3 Users: These versions of Word have an option under Tools > Options, General tab to \"Automatically generate drawing canvas when inserting autoshapes\". Using this option removes the need to do the final grouping of the map and shapes. We can now generate a visually appealing output for our report as seen in the following figure:, 223188=The pipe (|) is equal to the logical OR operator. In addition, XPath recognizes the logical OR and AND, as well as the equality operators: <=, <, >, >=, ==, and !=. For example, we can find all CDs released in 1985 or later using the following expression:, 196056=The data after the \"T\" is optional, therefore the following date: 2005-01-01 can be formatted using either date formatting option. Note that if you do not include the time zone offset, the time will be formatted to the UTC time., 224710=You could also access all the CD tittles released in 1988 using the following:, 185530=To use the Oracle format mask or the Microsoft format mask, the numbers in your data source must be in a raw format, with no formatting applied (for example: 1000.00). If the number has been formatted for European countries (for example: 1.000,00) the format will not work., 196021=2005-01-01T09:30:10-07:00, 64677=The shape-size command is used to stretch or shrink the cylinder based on the values of the elements SOFTWARE, HARDWARE, and SERVICES. The value is divided by 1000 to set the stretch or shrink factor. For example, if the value is 2000, divide that by 1000 to get a factor of 2. The shape will generate as twice its current height., 122005=The \"if\" statement is testing if the debit value is greater than 1000. If it is, then the next lines are invoked. Notice that the example embeds native XSL code inside the \"if\" statement., 119603=The template lists the accounts and their credit and debit values. In the final report we want to highlight in red any cell whose value is greater than 1000.

The Default text is displayed in the form field on your template. The figure below shows the Supplier field from the template with the added form field markup. In the help text entry field, enter the XML element's tag name using the syntax: <?XML element tag name?> You can enter multiple element tag names in the text entry field. In the example, the report field \"Supplier\" maps to the XML element VENDOR_NAME. In the Form Field Help Text field enter: <?VENDOR_NAME?> The following figure shows the Text Form Field Options dialog box and the Form Field Help Text dialog box with the appropriate entries for the Supplier field.

    "textAfterTable": "If your data source is a Data Template (for information, see Data Templates) and your results XML contains image data that had been stored as a BLOB in the database, use the following syntax in a form field inserted in your template where you want the image to render at runtime: <fo:instream-foreign-object content type=\"image/jpg\"> <xsl:value-of select=\"IMAGE_ELEMENT\"/> </fo:instream-foreign-object> where image/jpg is the MIME type of the image (other options might be: image/gif and image/png) and IMAGE_ELEMENT is the element name of the BLOB in your XML data. Note that you can specify height and width attributes for the image to set its size in the published report. BI Publisher will scale the image to fit the box size that you define. For example, to set the size of the example above to three inches by four inches, enter the following: <fo:instream-foreign-object content type=\"image/jpg\" height=\"3 in\" width=\"4 in\"> <xsl:value-of select=\"IMAGE_ELEMENT\"/> </fo:instream-foreign-object> Specify in pixels as follows: <fo:instream-foreign-object content type=\"image/jpg\" height=\"300 px\" width=\"4 px\"> ... or in centimeters: <fo:instream-foreign-object content type=\"image/jpg\" height=\"3 cm\" width=\"4 cm\"> ... or as a percentage of the original dimensions: <fo:instream-foreign-object content type=\"image/jpg\" height=\"300%\" width=\"300%\"> ...
