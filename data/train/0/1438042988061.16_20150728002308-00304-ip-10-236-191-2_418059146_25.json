Ozone generation unit (OGU) of our product can be cleaned; OGU of most other similar products is fixed and cannot be cleaned 3) Better cooling function brings more stable ozone generation 4) Higher concentration of ozone due to higher rate of conversion from room air to ozone 5) Better adaption to the environment}",

Press on \u2018Power Switch\u2019, and the \u2018Work Indicator\u2019 will light (green); the ozone generator is ready to work. 3. Turn the \u2018Timer\u2019 switch to the ongoing setting, and the machine will generate ozone continuously; you may also use an external timing control device to manage cycle programs under the ongoing setting. 4. Turn the \u2018Timer\u2019 switch to the other side with the time scales, and you can select length of session you wish the unit to run for. 5. Use the switch \u2018Ozone output adjustment\u2019 to adjust the ozone output amount. 6. The provided silicone tube is 3 metres long altogether, and you may cut it into 2 or 3 pieces according to your own requirement: A. The drying tube is connected to the ozone generator by silicone tube. Air passes the drying tube first before entering the unit and getting involved into the ozone generation process. B. For air purification, connect one end of the silicone tube to the ozone outlet of the",
