Currently there is only one food that can reduce their temper: Dolphins[edit | edit source] You can tame birds by giving them seeds, which is achieved by throwing the seeds to them. Once a bird is tamed it will not run away from the player and will not despawn, and you can put it on the character's head by right-clicking on it. Once a bird is on the character's head, they are able to glide with it. If the player has a bird on their head and they walk under a block that is just above their head, the bird will die. If they're riding a pegasus with a bird on their head it will cause the pegasus to fly faster. Birds[edit | edit source] To tame a big cat you must first find a cub. When you find the cub, drop raw fish or pork chops and use a medallion on it after it has eaten at least one. You can name it and it will follow you if you use a rope on it. Without the rope it will not follow you and roam around aimlessly. Use a whip to make them sit down. When tamed and fully grown, it will attack other mobs.A big cat won't take any",

To breed dolphins you will require: 2 cooked fish 2 dolphins (assumed) A place where they are within 4 squares of each other and 8 squares minimum away from you and other dolphins (assumed)5 minutes or half a Minecraft day To breed dolphins you must give each a cooked fish. Unlike horses, dolphins cannot become sterile and may breed indefinitely. After 5 minutes there will be a 3rd dolphin. If the two dolphins are of the same breed they will always have a baby of that breed, otherwise their Total Genetic Value (TGV) determines both the chance of getting a certain breed and which breed will be gotten. If their TGV is less than 5 and they are of different breeds there is a \u2153 chance of breeding a dolphin whose genetic value is equal to the TGV. If TGV is 5 or 6 and they are of different breeds there is a 1/10 chance of breeding a dolphin whose genetic value is equal to the TGV. If the breed is not determined in this manner it will be determined as for spawning a wild dolphin. Dolphin Genetic Value Blue 1 Green 2 Dark",
