The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes, which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims, are to be embraced within their scope. is illustrative only and by no means represents even a small portion of the wide variety of environments in which the principles of the present invention may be implemented. FIG. 7 represents a suitable operating environment for the present invention, the principles of the present invention may be employed in any system that is capable of, with suitable modification if necessary, implementing the principles of the present invention. The environment illustrated in FIG. 7 While , input/output interface 746 and modem 754 facilitate the exchange of data with remote computer system 793 via link 752. Link 752 represents a portion of a network and remote computer system 793 represents a node of the network. FIG. 7 Likewise, computer system 720 includes input/output interface 746, through which computer system 720 receives data from external sources and/or transmits data to external sources. Input/output interface 746 is coupled to modem 754 (e.g., a standard modem,",
