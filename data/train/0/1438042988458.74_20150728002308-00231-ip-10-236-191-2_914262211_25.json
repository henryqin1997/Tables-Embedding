            "The place is crawling with state troopers, I've never felt more protected and secure in my life.",
            "Phi Theta Kappa is the only organization on campus, and it's for honor students and people with outstanding GPAs.",
            "There are clubs out the wazoo. And creating a club isn't difficult at all. If there's something you want to do, there's a club for it.",
            "Students who are unsure of their direction. I'm not saying just go to school and see where it takes you, some people don't enjoy school, and that's okay. But Scott is all about creating opportunity for people to improve themselves.",
            "Definitely worth it as far as price per credit hour goes, but beware the bookstore, Since it was taken over by Barnes & Noble, you might as well walk in there prepared to lose a leg.",
            "Since I;m on the Cross Country team, that's mostly what I find fun on the campus. I also partake in the Creative Writing club, a super fun club with a light and open atmosphere, and I like to run the trails in the back of the school. Also, there's free food like ALL the time for the students. The school caters our lunches sometimes and it's really just great.",
            "The cafeteria was replaced with a Subway. You will get tired of Subway quickly.",
            "The school uses apartments that are adjusted to that student's income and tuition price. I don't live there, but they are relatively close by and people seem to enjoy them. I chose to live at home.",
            "Some classes are flat out easy, but there are many professors who realize that they're course work and expectations of the students are above and beyond what the students are used to. College level courses are definitely offered, and if someone wants to put in the time and effort, I definitely suggest it.",
            "Do research on the teachers. Talk to people who have been in the classroom with those teachers. Find out who has a good teaching style, who grades with more tenacity than others, who will challenge you with out making you feel like you're worthless. It will definitely pay off in the long run.",
            "A school is what you make it. Scott Community College has all the resources for students to become great. Students just have to accept the responsibility of becoming great students and realize that they have to put forth the effort if they want the results."

On the Belmont campus, the only option available in terms of more than snacks from the vending machines, is a Subway. It has been in place for only this fall 2012 semester, having replaced the previous commonplace school cafeteria, upon complaints the food served was not well liked. However, many students have acknowledged they quickly grew tired of Subway every week. Personally, I find it expensive to eat on a regular basis and prefer to bring a more diverse selection from home.}",
