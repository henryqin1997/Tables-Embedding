            "FILTER DESIGN TOOL - A method according to an embodiment of a filter design tool is provided and includes receiving filter parameters for an analog filter through a user interface, where the filter parameters include an optimization parameter related to an application requirement of the analog filter, optimizing the filter for the optimization parameter, calculating a design output based on the optimized filter, and displaying the design output on the user interface. The method can further include receiving viewing parameters that specify the design output to be displayed. In various embodiments, the user interface includes an input area, a viewing area and a window area in one or more pages, where the input area is contiguous to the viewing area in at least one page. The filter parameters can be entered in the input area and the design output is calculated and displayed in the contiguous viewing area substantially immediately.",

Duff, Longmont, CO US 08-01-2013 MODIFICATION OF SOLID STATE CdZnTe (CZT) RADIATION DETECTORS WITH HIGH SENSITIVITY OR HIGH RESOLUTION OPERATION - An apparatus and process is provided to illustrate the manipulation of the internal electric field of CZT using multiple wavelength light illumination on the crystal surface at RT. The control of the internal electric field is shown through the polarization in the IR transmission image under illumination as a result of the Pockels effect. 20130193336 Published Description Patent application number Martine C. Duff, Aiken, SC US 05-23-2013 MOVABLE HIGHLIGHT STRIP - A highlighter strip including adhesive to form a removable bond with a substrate, constructed from a translucent and colored material. The highlighter strip can be affixed over writing or other markings, which highlights the indicia that remains legible. One or both ends of the strip can omit the adhesive, thereby providing a grabbing portion to facilitate removal from an initial position and optionally subsequent positions. The strip can be included in a set of strips affixed to each other and optionally affixed to another base; such as a notebook, binder, or other entity where one would expect writing, text, or other indicia requiring highlighting. 20130127148 Published Description Patent application number Lisa Duff, Patchogue, NY US //]]> BarDraw('4045782',['Patent applications by Joseph G.

    "textAfterTable": "Matthew Nathan Duff, Somerville, MA US Patent application number Description Published 20120188009 APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR AMPLIFICATION WITH HIGH FRONT-END GAIN IN THE PRESENCE OF LARGE DC OFFSETS - Apparatus and methods reduce the likelihood of amplifier saturation due to propagated DC offsets, and reduce the recover from saturated stated when such saturation occurs. Advantageously, these attributes are beneficial for monitoring of bioelectric signals. A circuit uses an instrumentation amplifier connected as a high pass filter to attenuate large DC offsets and amplify small signals. The circuit can include an instrumentation amplifier electrically coupled with a first feedback circuit including at least one resistor and a second feedback circuit including an op-amp. The feedback circuit can also include a low-pass filter. The op-amp in the second feedback circuit can be configured as a non-inverting amplifier, an inverting amplifier, and/or an integrator circuit. Alternatively, the circuit can include an instrumentation amplifier with one feedback circuit including at least one resistor, and a coupling capacitor electrically coupled with a reference voltage. 07-26-2012 Michael Duff, Orefield, PA US Patent application number Description Published 20130270143 TWO-PIECE PACKAGE AND METHOD OF ASSEMBLING THE SAME - A two-piece package includes a container and a lid. The container includes a side wall, a bottom, an open end, an open end and a circumferential flange extending outward from the open end. The bottom, the sidewall, and the circumferential",
