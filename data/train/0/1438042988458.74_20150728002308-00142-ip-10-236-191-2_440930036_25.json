The method includes neutralizing a glyoxal solution and dispersing the neutralized glyoxal solution in the liquid hydrocarbon media. The neutralized glyoxal solution is dispersed within the liquid hydrocarbon media not more than 10 days after the glyoxal solution has been neutralized. A hydrogen sulfide scavenging composition and method for making are also provided.",

A corrosion inhibitor composition is dispersed into a liquid hydrocarbon media to form a protective film on the metallic surfaces. The corrosion inhibitor includes a polyamic acid having structure I: 20130302210 03-22-2012 HYDROGEN SULFIDE SCAVENGER COMPOSITIONS, METHODS FOR MAKING AND PROCESSES FOR REMOVING HYDROGEN SULFIDE FROM LIQUID HYDROCARBON MEDIA - A method for reducing the amount of hydrogen sulfide present in liquid hydrocarbon media while minimizing the amount of corrosion in processing equipment contacting the liquid hydrocarbon media. The method includes adjusting a glyoxal solution to a pH of from about 2.5 to about 6.0 and dispersing the adjusted glyoxal solution in the liquid hydrocarbon media. A hydrogen sulfide scavenging composition and method for making are also provided. 20120067783 Published Description Patent application number Gregory Kaplan, Trevose, PA US 07-04-2013 SULFIDE SCAVENGERS, METHODS FOR MAKING AND METHODS FOR USING - Methods for making sulfide scavenging compositions are provided. The method comprises reacting at least one secondary amine with at least one aldehyde and solvent in the presence of a catalyst to form a reaction composition, wherein a reaction temperature is less than or equal to 90\u00b0 C. Sulfide scavengers using the above method are also disclosed. Methods",

The method includes assigning one or multiple PUIDs for surrogate registration purposes during the provisioning of the aggregate endpoint, performing reliable surrogate registration on behalf of the aggregate endpoint, allowing multiple SBCs to perform surrogate registrations independently for the same aggregate endpoint to achieve reliability, and providing reliable connection from an IMS core to the aggregate endpoints via multiple S/BCs. The system includes one or more Session Border Controllers (S/BC), at least one set of Call/Session Control Functions (CSCF), and an HSS operatively coupled together. 08-30-2012 Hadriel Kaplan, Nashua, NH US Patent application number Description Published 20110317688 Dynamic Federations - Systems and methods of establishing IP telephony sessions between enterprises are disclosed. A first enterprise requests an association with a second enterprise. Both enterprises and the second enterprise belong to the same federation. The association request is accepted, to establish an association between the first and second enterprises. In response to the acceptance, a direct routed path is established between the first enterprise and the second enterprise. One of the associated enterprises requests activation of an IP telephony service. If the request to activate references the association,",
