            "I truly believe anyone could walk on this campus because security guards do not check IDs time to time. Also, they do favoritism with other students which is unacceptable.",
            "I haven't fully experienced the Greek life because aim not a party girl but from what I've heard, their parties are awesome and worth paying for.",
            "Iam giving their clubs and activities a three because they aren't organized enough from my point of view. I am a person that try to be on time for everything. When they say 3:00 they actually mean thirty to an hour later.",
            "Great for students who want to join the Air Force or the Army. Anyone who wants to learn how to fly an airplane for a career we have an Aviation class there. It's definitely not cheap..",
            "We have a Pizza Hut on campus. The location is called t The Sac everyone hangs there or around there. There's a game room, a lounge, and two TV rooms.",
            "At Florida Memorial, they provide Direct TV. Cable, Kick boxing, workout routines, and etc.",
            "If you join organizations and go out there and meet new people, you will enjoy yourself. Especially if you have a vehicle because everything is so far from Florida Memorial University.",
            "The food isn't too exciting to me. You'll think because this school is private their cooking game would be upscale or something good. I'll be completely honest; their food suck. Also, they don't allow us to take our food that we paid for outside the cafeteria. That is ridiculous.",
            "The dorms are okay. I like my room it's not a problem. Although, I would prefer I bigger room with a small bed instead of a twin bed. You just need to learn how to adjust to new environments.",
            "As people usually say, do your work and study you will accomplish your goals. They provide tutors for free so accept it if you need it. Get a relationship with your professors for that will help you in the long run.",
            "If you want to know something, majority of the time you have to go out there and ask the right people. Being involved in different organizations will help you to enhance your opportunities to a beautiful experience.",
            "Florida Memorial is an interesting school depending on you. If you choose to go out and mango with new people you will enjoy your time there. Also, it will be nice for you to get involved in different organizations."

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students a heads up about this university would be that the food is not that appealing and females dress like the are in a fashion show every day. Oh and be prepared to dress professionally every Wednesday. Am enjoying being here besides the parties, i love my roomates, and the many activities that take place on compus its loads of fun Am learning a lot The professors at this university are loads of fun and make learning a pleasure, small class ensure one on one time with your instructor allowing a better understanding of the material.
