The composition may also contain a dextrin, e. g. tapioca dextrin, and a high amylose starch. The composition is dispersed in an aqueous medium having from about 20 to 80 weight percent of the composition for application to a food prior to fat frying., 95519=#4692621Sep 8, 1987, 35730=Date: Feb 05, 2015, 77103=Filed: Apr 1, 2011, 78982=Filed: Apr 4, 2012, 133665=Birthday: 1916, 68125=#2013020Aug 15, 2013, 112019=Published: 06 Apr, 2010, 107426=Published: 14 Oct, 2010, 52495=#2013021Aug 22, 2013, 36653=Date: Feb 01, 2015, 55189=Filed: Feb 22, 2012, 89742=Filed: Jan 4, 2001, 50306=Filed: Sep 7, 2011, 66173=#2013021Aug 15, 2013, 87356=Filed: Nov 15, 1996, 31371=Date: Mar 24, 2015, 94061=#D447334Sep 4, 2001, 131801=Birthday: 1941, 123555=School:Brien McMahon High School Norwalk, CT, 1973-1977, 83347=#5825652Oct 20, 1998, 100144=Filed: Aug 31, 1999, 70623=#2012019Aug 2, 2012, 42858=Date: Jan 19, 2015, 105040=Published: 28 May, 2010, 32597=Date: Mar 12, 2015, 111033=Published: 20 Jan, 2009, 134661=Birthday: 1943, 85694=#D423640Apr 25, 2000, 125082=Schools:Lloyd Elementary School Ft.
