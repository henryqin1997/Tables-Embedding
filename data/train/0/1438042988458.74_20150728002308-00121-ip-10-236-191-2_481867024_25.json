In this scenario, RPR packets are sent out by node 1410(5) and a new physical path is provisioned to restore the virtual path. The RPR packets need not go any further than node 1410(5) (unless there are insufficient resources within zone 1440) because node 1410(7) acts as a proxy for destination node 1420(1). By employing a proxy boundary node, the restoration process is limited to the zone in which the failure occurred and so the network overhead associated with sending RPR packets outside of zone 1440 is avoided. Thus, the restoration of the virtual path focuses on zone 1440, resulting in, for example, a new physical path 1490 from node 1410(5), through nodes 1410(4) and 1410(6) to node 1410(7). Assuming 1410(5) is the source node and that 1420(1) is the destination node, it can be seen that the same scenario for a failure in zone 1450 affecting the virtual path would follow a similar sequence. In that case, a new physical path supporting the original virtual path would be provisioned within zone 1450, with no effect on the overhead experienced by the nodes outside that zone (this being a result of node 1420(6) acting as a proxy for the source node (node 1410(5)))., 222508=6. When the Create-Path message arrives at a transit zone (e.g. zone 1460) (step 1550), the message is forwarded in the manner described in step 1530 (step 1560). The entry boundary node, i.e., the node that receives the request from the boundary node of the previous zone (node 1430(1) in this example), then establishes a path for the VP within its own zone using the restoration method described previously (step 1570). The entry boundary node uses the exit boundary node (node 1430(5) in this example) as a target node for all restore-path requests., 212919=However, should the virtual path traverse one or more of the inter-zone links, the manner in which failures at various points along the virtual path are dealt with varies depending on where along the virtual path the failure occurs. For example, a virtual path provisioned over a physical path 1485 and starting again at node 1410(5), proceeding through nodes 1410(7), 1420(6), 1420(5), and 1420(4), and terminating at node 1420(1) may encounter a failure at one of several points. For this configuration, nodes 1410(7) and 1420(6) are the boundary nodes for their respective zones (zones 1440 and 1450, respectively). In certain failure scenarios, nodes 1420(6) and 1410(7) act as proxy nodes for their respective source/destination nodes (nodes 1410(5) and 1420(1), respectively) in order to restrict restoration efforts to the affected zone. Failures, however, can occur at any of the nodes along the path, or at one of the links along the path., 207950=The above strategy, is not the preferred method of handling link errors because the fast restoration times required dictates that 2-way, end-to-end communication be carried out in less than 50 ms. A drawback of the above-described solution is the time wasted while waiting for an acknowledgment to come back from the receiving node. A safe timeout period for a 2000 mile span, for instance, is over 35 ms, which doesn't leave enough time for a retransmission in case of an error., 228462=Such a header may include, for example, a request response indicator (RRI), a negative response indicator (NRI), a terminate/commit path indicator (TPI), a flush path indicator (FPI), a command field, a sequence number, an origin node ID (1670) and a target node ID. A description of these fields is provided below in Table 10. It will be noted that although the terms \u201corigin\u201d and \u201ctarget\u201d are used in describing header 1600, their counterparts (source and destination, respectively) can be used in their stead. Preferably, packets sent using a protocol according to the present invention employ a header layout such as that shown as header 1600. The header is then followed by zero or more bytes of command specific data., 209766=Addressing in such a network could use an addressing scheme, and could, for example, use an addressing scheme such as that shown in FIG. 1 as a type 1 address. This would likely be appropriate given the fact that there are a relatively small number of zones, with each including a relatively small number of nodes. Using such an addressing scheme, zones 1440, 1450, and 1460 are assigned zone IDs 1, 2, and 3, respectively, with zone ID 0 being reserved for the inter-zone, or backbone, zone. Within these zones, each one of nodes 1410(1)-(7), 1420(1)-(6), and 1430(1)-(5) is assigned a node ID made up of the zone ID for the node's zone and a node address within the zone (1-7, 1-6, and 1-5, respectively). Node addresses for each of nodes 1410(1)-(7), 1420(1)-(6), and 1430(1)-(5) are provided as numerals within each of the circles representing the nodes in FIG. 14. Terminology used herein to describe these methods includes:, 209217=FIG. 14 illustrates an exemplary multi-zone network 1400 organized into zones according to one embodiment of the present invention. Network 1400 includes nodes 1410(1)-(7), nodes 1420(1)-(6), and nodes 1430(1)-(5). Those nodes are grouped into zones 1440, 1450, and 1460, and a backbone zone 1465, as is illustrated in FIG. 14. The zones are linked to one another by inter-zone links 1470(1)-(4)., 223144=7. When the message finally arrives at the entry boundary node of the target zone (node 1420(1) and zone 1450, respectively), the sequence described in step 1540 is followed to establish the requested paths (step 1580). The target node in this case is the actual end point of the VP (node 1420(3) in this example)., 202593=FIG. 13 illustrates the steps taken in processing positive RPR responses. The processing of positive RPR responses begins at step 1300 with a search of the local database to determine whether an RPRE corresponding to the RPR response is stored therein. If a corresponding RPRE cannot be found, the RPR response is ignored (step 1310). If the RPR response RPRE is found in the local database, the input link is verified as being consistent with the path stored in the RPR (step 1320). If the input link is not consistent with the RPR path, the RPR response is ignored once again (step 1310). If the input link is consistent with path information in the RPR, the next hop information specified in the RPR response path is compared with the Received From field of the RPRE (e.g., Response.Path[Response.PathIndex+1]!=RPRE.ReceivedFrom) (step 1330). If the next hop information is not consistent, the RPR response is again ignored (step 1310). However, if the RPR response's next hop information is consistent, bandwidth allocated on input and output links related to the RPR is committed (step 1340). Conversely, bandwidth allocated on all other input and output links for that VP is freed at this time (step 1350). Additionally, a positive response is sent to the node from which the RPR was received (step 1360), and an RPR deletion timer is started (step 1370) and the local matrix is configured (step 1380)., 225609=4. Tandem nodes within the zone forward the message using information specified in its path, continues until the message finally reaches the exit boundary node (node 1430(5)), which also uses the next hop contained in its path to forward the message to the entry boundary node of the next zone (node 1420(1) and zone 1450, respectively) (steps 1630 and 1640)., 74178=This invention also claims priority from a provisional application entitled \u201cA NETWORK ADDRESSING SCHEME FOR REDUCING PROTOCOL OVERHEAD IN AN OPTICAL NETWORK\u201d (U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/137,472, filed Jun. 4, 1999, having S. N. Ali and S. E. Plote as inventors, which is hereby incorporated by reference, in its entirety and for all purposes., 221087=3. A source-routed message is then sent to the boundary node that connects the current zone of the next zone along the path (step 1520), which would also be the target zone if a parallel link were found in step 2. That node is referred to herein as the origin boundary node, since that node is responsible for establishing the intra-zone leg of the overall path. The node is also referred to herein as a boundary tandem node since that node is responsible for forwarding the Create-Path message to the next tandem boundary node along the inter-zone path. In this example, this node is node 1410(3) and the next zone along the path is zone 1460., 166139=In one embodiment of networks herein, failures are detected using the mechanisms provided by the underlying physical network. For example, when using a SONET network, a fiber cut on a given link results in a loss of signal (LOS) condition at the nodes connected by that link. The LOS condition propagates an Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) and Remote Defect Indication (RDI), and generates an LOS defect locally. The defect is upgraded to a failure 2.5 seconds later, which causes an alarm to be sent to the Operations System (OS) (per Bellcore's recommendations in GR-253 (GR-253: Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) Transport Systems, Common Generic Criteria, Issue 2 [Bellcore, December 1995], included herein by reference, in its entirety and for all purposes)). Preferably when using SONET, the handling of the LOS condition follows Bellcore's recommendations in GR-253, which allows nodes to inter-operate, and co-exist, with other network equipment (NE) in the same network and which is included by reference herein in its entirety and for all purposes. The mesh restoration protocol is invoked as soon as the LOS defect is detected by the line card, which occurs 3ms following the failure (a requirement under GR-253)., 211745=Restoration of failures in network 1400 can proceed in several different ways, depending on the route taken by the virtual path in question and the location of the failure. A failure affecting a virtual path routed within a single zone can therefore proceed according to a paradigm such as that previously outlined with regard to the restoration of virtual paths. Preferably, messages related to an intra-zone failure stay within that zone unless there are no resources within the zone to restore the failure. In such a case, one or more of the boundary nodes follow a procedure such as that described subsequently. A virtual path provisioned over a physical path 1475 that is completely within zone 1440, for example, from node 1410(5) to node 1410(6) through node 1410(7), that experiences a failure between nodes 1410(5) and 1410(7) can be restored by configuring a physical path 1480 between nodes 1410(5), 1410(4), and 1410(6), for example, as a result of using the previously-described method of restoration., 224349=FIG. 16 illustrates the forwarding of Create-Path requests through a transit zone, in which the following steps are performed in one embodiment (again, please refer to zone 1460 of the network in FIG. 14 during the following discussion):, 73734=This application is a continuation-in-part of patent application Ser. No. 09/232,397, filed Jan. 15, 1999 and entitled \u201cA METHOD FOR ROUTING INFORMATION OVER A NETWORK,\u201d having A. N. Saleh, H. M. Zadikian, Z. Baghdasarian, and V. Parsi as inventors. This application is assigned to Monterey Networks, Inc., the assignee of the present invention, and is hereby incorporated by reference, in its entirety and for all purposes., 183488=Processing of RPRs begins at step 1000, in which the target node's ID is compared to the local node's ID. If the local node's ID is equal to the target node's ID, the local node is the target of the RPR and must process the RPR as such. This is illustrated in FIG. 10 as step 1005 and is the subject of the flow diagram illustrated in FIG. 11. If the local node is not the target node, the RPR's HOP_COUNT is compared to MAX_HOP in order to determine if the HOP_COUNT has exceed or will exceed the maximum number of hops allowable (step 1010). If this is the case, a negative acknowledgment (NAK) with a Flush indicator is then sent back to the originating node (step 1015). If the HOP_COUNT is still within acceptable limits, the node then determines whether this is the first instance of the RPR having been received (step 1020). If this is the case, a Restore-Path Request Entry (RPRE) is created for the request (step 1025). This is done by creating the RPRE and setting the RPRE's fields, including starting a time-to-live (TTL) or deletion timer, in the following manner:, 219889=2. The master boundary node (node 1410(1), because its node ID of 1.1 is numerically lower than that of node 1420(2) (with a node ID of 2.2)) computes a new inter-zone route for each failed VP using the topology database for inter-zone link 1470(1), which is part of backbone zone 1465 (step 1510). The vertices of a graph of backbone zone 1465 represent entire zones (e.g., zones 1445, 1450, and 1460) interconnected by inter-zone links 1470(1)-(4). The master boundary node first tries to establish the route over inter-zone links that are parallel to the failed link (inter-zone link 1470(1)). If unsuccessful, which is the case in this example, the node then tries to establish the paths over links that traverse other zones (e.g., inter-zone link 1470(3)). A method of path selection, such as that described herein, is used in the latter case to select the shortest path (e.g., minimum-hop path) between the two zones. The resulting route for this example is [zone 1440\u2192zone 1460\u2192zone 1450]., 74555=This application is related to patent application Ser. No. 09/232,395, filed Jan. 15, 1999 and entitled \u201cA CONFIGURABLE NETWORK ROUTER,\u201d having H. M. Zadikian, A. N. Saleh, J. C. Adler, Z. Baghdasarian, and V. Parsi as inventors. This related application is assigned to Monterey Networks, Inc., the assignee of the present invention, and is hereby incorporated by reference, in its entirety and for all purposes., 218663=FIG. 15 illustrates a method according to a network employing a zoned architecture. In this example, a virtual path (VP) is provisioned in network 1400 and has been assigned a physical path 1495 routed as follows (in terms of both node IDs and reference numerals): 1.6\u21921.1\u21922.2\u21922.3 (node 1410(6)\u2192node 1410(1)\u2192node 1420(2)\u2192node 1420(3)). In the case of a failure on the link between nodes 1410(1) and 1420(2), the following gives an example of one method of restoring the path that employs the zoned topology depicted in FIG. 14.}",
