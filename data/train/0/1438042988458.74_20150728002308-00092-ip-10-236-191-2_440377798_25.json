            "Description",
            "WATER JET ASSEMBLY WITH A SLIP RING - A water jet assembly and method for installing a water jet assembly incorporating a slip ring for a facilitating the joining of a scallop plate facing the interior water-receiving portion of a spa shell with a water jet housing on the exterior portion of a spa shell between a gasket and a scallop plate.",
            "Clip for Providing Light to a WaterJet - A clip and system for providing light to a spa, having a clip for holding a light emitting device and a waterjet housing structure manufactured at least in part from a clear material and having a connector allowing the attachment of the clip to the housing structure, the clip having a support structure for containing and/or supporting the light emitting device and a clip connector for attaching the clip to the housing.",
            "RETENTION CLIP - A retention clip for mounting spa fixtures through the wall of a spa reservoir. A retention clip may be placed in a hole that has been bored through a spa wall. Bore positioning features of the clip may provide a means for advantageously centering the retention clip in the hole. A flange mates to the surface of the tub wall once the retention clip is inserted through the bore and a plurality of retention fingers will extend beyond the opposite side of the tub wall. Subsequently, a fixture may be inserted through the retention clip. A chamfered feature of the fixture physically communicates with the retention fingers and operates to apply a force radially outward to each, thereby causing retention tongues located on the spines of each retention finger to engage a groove feature on the fixture body.",
            "POOL LIGHT ADAPTER RING - A pool light adapter ring for retrofitting a pool light in a pool wall niche. The adapter ring has a pair of interlocking hooks to allow the ring to be compressed to a first, compressed state, inserted into a wall niche and then relaxed to a second, rigid state. The adapter ring has mounting brackets attached to the ring for receipt of a pool light or other device. The adapter ring also has a plurality of anchor screws for securing the adapter ring inside the niche. Further, some embodiments may include a grounding screw for attaching the grounding wire from the pool light.",
            "CLIP FOR PROVIDING LIGHT TO A SPA FEATURE - A clip and system for providing light to a spa feature, having a clip for holding a light emitting device and a spa feature having a housing connector, the spa feature and the housing connector being manufactured at least in part from a clear material and having a connector allowing the attachment of the clip to the spa feature, the clip having a support structure for containing and/or supporting the light emitting device and a clip connector for attaching the clip to the spa feature.",
            "BATH WITH FLOWING WATER - A water bath apparatus for producing a generally unidirectional or non-centric, gentle and/or relaxing water flow within a tub about a user's body without noticeable or significant vibration and/or noise, including a water flow that is directed away from, or at least not towards, the center of the tub, such as a generally unidirectional or non-centric water flow along or across the tub so as to provide or emulate a flowing stream of water along the body of the user. Specifically placed water inlet ports and water outlet ports provide for the generally unidirectional or non-centric water flow."

Drury, Peachtree City, GA US 02-03-2011 Three-dimensional tactical display and method for visualizing data with a probability of uncertainty - A feeder program is utilized for collecting and reading in and maintaining a time synchronization for combat fire solutions which may include threat containment regions. The threat containment regions are defined in terms of a probability of at least one threat being located therein. A three-dimensional viewer program displays bathometry information, an ownship relative position relative to said bathometry information, and determines what portions of said plurality of threat containment regions and said tracking and position information are to be displayed based on an angle of a view. 20110025684 Published Description Patent application number Tood P. Drury, Bristol, RI US 03-31-2011 Method For Displaying Intersections And Expansions of Three Dimensional Volumes - A method is provided for displaying intersections and expansions of three dimensional volumes comprising the steps of representing a volume in a binary-enumerated three dimensional array format wherein data points outside the volume are set to a first value and data points inside the at least one volume are set to a second value. Surface data points of the volume are determined by comparing each data point with neighboring data points and selecting data points which have neighboring data points which differ in value as the surface data points. The surface data points are classified wherein the classifications comprise at least",
