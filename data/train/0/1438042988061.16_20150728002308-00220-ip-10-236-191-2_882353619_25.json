Full-time tuition is usually approximately $1200 (4 classes) per semester., 104859=For your core classes it's not a bad deal, you're looking at roughly $2000-$4000 a semester. Don't expect to be academically challenged,and be prepared for a lot of professors with serious attitude problems. Staff is generally unfriendly as well, and if there are any problems they often get flustered, offended and flat out rude., 230864=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 68599=CSM does not offer on-campus housing. Therefore, any out-of-state residents should consider saving funds for at least a year prior to enrolling, or consider attending with a friend as a roommate consideration, since Charles County is on the outskirts of Washington DC. Therefore, local apartment costs are very expensive for teenagers, averaging above $1000 per month., 37992=College of Southern Maryland in La Plata Maryland is a beautiful campus that is being redecorated as of 2011. There are many majors you can chose from and many programs if you want to get certified for something as driving trucks you can. They are always willing to help you if you are willing to ask for help.}",

Am enjoying being here I enjoy being at CSM because not only are there a great range of academic classes and programs to be a part of, there are also great friends to be made here. The staff is also very helpful and I can approach my professors whenever I need help, unlike in highschool. Am learning a lot I am learning several new things at this college. A great thing about CSM is that they teach you new and efficient ways to understand hard concepts than what they did in high school. It's terrific.
