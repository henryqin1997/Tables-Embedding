    "textBeforeTable": "Recommended releases Downloads So to improve this process, we have packaged Project Kickstart distribution with latest Drupal core and commonly used modules. All of the contributed modules, have been picked carefully and used by us in many projects. Generally we start the Drupal project development with downloading latest Drupal core and many contributed modules. For example, we need to go through various modules to find out the best suited modules for different purposes like Content, Mail, Search, Performance, User Management, Developer Tools etc. Then we need to enable those modules and need to look for dependencies, if any. The main purpose of Project Kickstart distribution is to start the Drupal project development quickly with the best recommended libraries / modules / themes. Site builders can also use this distribution as it has features like responsive design for mobile devices, in-place content editing, pre-configured CKEditor WYSIWYG tool!
