Centuries-old rail systems will find new homes in museums, and short-range air travel will become almost non-existent., 56433=Image: Lazard, Levelized Cost of Energy Analysis -- Version 8.0, 2014, 33998=In the long, slow recovery from the 2008 financial collapse, the banking industry has increasingly been regarded as a buglight for the untrustworthy., 30836=Portland, Oregon's Capital Pacific Bank (OTCBB:CPBO) was founded in 2003 as a local bank to serve the needs of local businesses. In the intervening decade, it has grown into a full-scale financial institution that also has a mission of sustainability and community involvement., 101453=A further reason for the 2002-2009 correlation is that the economy was humming along very well at that time. This helped fuel investor optimism that the market would continue to grow for solar, wind, and the like. Similarly, oil became a strong proxy for the stock market at that time, as speculators started investing heavily in oil. They believed that as the global economy expanded, there would be more demand for oil, thus raising the prospects for oil prices. In essence, oil became a proxy for the stock market., 3395=This article was first published on the author's Forbes.com blog, Green Stocks on March 5th., 88728=Exhibit 1: Costs of Computer Processing Power, Electricity from Solar PV, and Oil Price per Barrel, 1976-2014[i], 104003=After this crash, no clear trend emerged until the end of 2012, when the next up-channel started. At that time, investors felt that alternative energy stock prices better reflected the economic realities of the underlying business, and started buying again. There is likely another reason, though, that it took five years for alternative energy markets to recover. Psychologically, after getting severely burned in the crash of 2008, it took a long time for investors to feel comfortable dipping their toes back in the water., 79491=[ii] IEA, \"Energy Technology Perspectives 2014 Harnessing Electricity's Potential,\" Global Outlook, 2014. https://www.iea.org/media/ETP14_factsheets.pdf, 102141=The chart at right shows crude oil (Cushing OK spot) as compared to the NEX over two time periods. From 2001 to 2009, oil and alternative energy prices were very strongly linked. For you math wonks, the two had a correlation coefficient of 0.87, which is extremely significant. This makes sense, since a rise in oil prices would mean that other energy alternatives become more attractive. From 2010 to the present, the NEX had a slight negative correlation to oil prices. The two markets did not exactly go in opposite directions, but they had virtually no corresponding movement., 108766=As far as transportation is concerned, I suspect that by 2050, they won't even be building internal combustion passenger vehicles anymore.

When we grow and use more fossil-commodity\u2013based energy, that energy becomes more expensive -- and economic growth is thwarted. But as we grow with technology-based energies, the increasing power demand decreases the cost of that energy and further stimulates economies! Put another way, consider the simulative effects as we realize the IEA's estimate of \"over USD 115 trillion in fuel savings\"[ii] by 2050 as the transition to tech-based renewables, chiefly solar, advances. Solar, although already grid-competitive in many areas, is just getting started. The blue line in the exhibit suggests what may yet be possible as solar technology evolves to enjoy the same level of scale and investment as semiconductors. Even with using current solar technology, though, $115 trillion is a heck of a liquidity injection., 30122=At the end of 2013, CPB had $239 million in total assets, and net income of $1.8 million, or $0.69 per share, the highest annual earnings in the company's history. It had double digit growth in both deposits and loans, and an 8.8% return on equity for the year. It closed out the year with a book value per common share of $8.36., 109414=Even with all of these wonderful and exciting innovations that will move us forward as a global society, it's highly unlikely that all of the world's energy needs in 2050 will be met without the inclusion of fossil fuels., 18835=Posted by Tom Konrad at 03:56 PM | Permalink | Comments (0), 84541=No one has written more clearly on this than investor Jeremy Grantham: \"As a sign of the immediacy of this problem, we have never spent more money developing new oil supplies than we did last year (nearly $700 billion) nor, despite U.S. fracking, found less -- replacing in the last 12 months only 4 1/2 months' worth of current production! Clearly, the writing is on the wall. It is now up to our leadership and to us as individuals to read it and act accordingly.\" In a sidebar, Grantham goes on: \"The only longer-term price relief and net benefit to the economy will come when either we reverse recent history and start to find more oil more cheaply, which will be like waiting for pigs to fly, or when cheaper sources of energy displace oil.\"[vi] As economist Gregor MacDonald recently tweeted: \"Sorry, did everyone forget Majors started cutting capex in Q1 of 2014, because $100 not enough to outrun declining ROI on runaway costs?\"[vii], 32015=\u201c[It's] the unique structure - not-for-profit, member-owned cooperative - of credit unions that gives them the ability to offer better rates and member-focused service,\u201d CUNA said in a statement in August., 83550=In the end, no producer can sell oil for less than it costs to recover it. And those costs are high -- too high to compete in the long run. As Stanford lecturer Tony Seba recently said, \"Put these numbers together and you find that solar has improved its cost basis by 5,355 times relative to oil since 1970...traditional sources of energy can't compete with this\"[viii] [italics added]. A nexus of effects is arising from the interplay of tech and commodity energy dynamics, and few if any of them are favorable to fossil fuels., 32814=A portmanteau of \u201cbankers\u201d and \u201cgangsters,\u201d the term was first used in 1933, but embraced anew when people saw what had become of their assets. Trust in banks sank., 112707=In Saudi Arabia, we recognize that eventually, one of these days, we\u2019re not going to need fossil fuels. I don\u2019t know when - 2040, 2050 or thereafter. So we have embarked on a program to develop solar energy. Hopefully, one of these days, instead of exporting fossil fuels, we will be exporting gigawatts of electric power., 63161=Posted by Jeff Siegel at 09:55 PM | Permalink | Comments (0), 134614=Posted by Debra Fiakas at 09:00 AM | Permalink | Comments (0), 34857=Posted by Tom Konrad at 11:27 PM | Permalink | Comments (0), 63956=Because 2015 is going to be busy, loud, and very, very profitable., 98946=The charts at right show natural gas (Henry Hub LA spot) compared to the NEX. There is a clearly a correlation between the two, though it is somewhat weak. It is also interesting to note that at starting around 2015, there was a divergence between natural gas prices and the NEX., 72915=Abengoa Yield took a bit of a tumble last September, falling from around $40 a share to about $25 a share (although it should be noted that the company's only been public since last June)., 6688=This article was first published on the author's Forbes.com blog, Green Stocks on March 16th., 104843=The first down channel on the chart coincides with a general stock market slump. This drop started during the eight month recession which began in March 2001., 67068=This is a shame, since we really don't know how 2015 will unfold. And until something horrible actually happens, it's really nothing more than an illusion., 39596=The divestment movement was only in its infancy when coal stocks peaked in 2011, so divestment has been only a minor contributor to their decline. Bullard attributes most of the decline to fundamental factors, such as low gas prices and (to a limited extent) wind power in the US, and concerns about air pollution in China., 94944=The first important domestic incentive is the Business Energy Investment Tax Credit (ITC). The ITC rebates up to 30% for solar, fuel cells, wind, combined heat and power (CHP) and geothermal. This incentive is scheduled to sunset at the end of 2016. Whether it gets renewed or not will affect the rate at which renewable projects go forward. This will cause concern for investors., 78447=[v] Parkinson, Giles, \"Solar Costs Will Fall Another 40% In 2 Years.

A that point I was in love - that's a big kicker for climate change related investments. Of course the majority of their investments are in the form of bonds - which will mean increased demand for climate bonds and green bonds. Yes, that's increased demand in the already hot market., 28705=Since the crisis of 2008, banks have increased their efforts in mobile and online banking services to cut any overlap in service. If a customer can deposit his checks and manage his finances online, he would have no reason to go to his local branch and waste several hours of his precious time., 119504=Posted by Debra Fiakas at 04:12 PM | Permalink | Comments (0), 6394=Posted by Tom Konrad at 08:58 AM | Permalink | Comments (0), 91592=Posted by Harris Roen at 09:47 AM | Permalink | Comments (0), 77141=[viii] Ahmed, Nafeez, \"How Solar Power Could Slay the Fossil Fuel Empire by 2030\", Motherboard, December 10, 2014. http://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-solar-power-could-slay-the-fossil-fuel-empire-by-2030, 11350=Posted by Tom Konrad at 08:43 AM | Permalink | Comments (0), 124663=Posted by Garvin at 09:04 AM | Permalink | Comments (0), 76455=Posted by Garvin at 09:29 AM | Permalink | Comments (0), 108958=By 2030, 30% of the U.S. will be powered by renewables. And that's a conservative estimate., 104320=The Great Recession then hit in December 2007, just as alternative energy stocks appeared to be ascending into nosebleed territory. As a result, prices came crashing down a painful 71% in about a year. This outstripped the distressing declines the stock market in general had at that time., 103459=Following the uptrend that went from 2012 to the beginning of 2014, there was a noteworthy giveback. The NEX fell 21% in about nine and a half months. Much of that giveback has been regained. It remains to be seen if the current trend will continue to be positive, or if we have entered into a sideways market., 4454=In truth, that scenario is not at all improbable. It happens all the time. Most investors own slices of most large, publicly traded companies. 44% of US households owned mutual funds in 2012. Whenever a large public company harms more than one household through its actions, it\u2019s probably harming a shareholder. Only our hands-off approach to our investments, often through multiple intermediaries like advisers and mutual funds, keeps us from thinking about the harm we\u2019re doing to ourselves., 100684=The correlation between oil and the stock market remained strong for a decade, but finally started to diverge at the end of 2013. Since then there has been a strong negative correlation., 77994=[vi] Grantham, Jeremy, \"The Beginning of the End of the Fossil Fuel Revolution (From Golden Goose to Cooked Goose)\" GMO Quarterly Letter Third Quarter 2014. https://www.gmo.com/America/CMSAttachmentDownload?target=JUBRxi51IICva8EQo4wdFQADWV9wEmzLzeD%2fGf9Lvs9eioH3K0LxNpPNgOFRVI8cwSP%2bAMJGLMAyxMzMVtpN8J49yf%2f%2bWX0Iv0NKRoYDe6hfhF3WeEjFuA%3d%3d, 3067=Posted by Tom Konrad at 09:22 AM | Permalink | Comments (3), 64135=So enjoy your last remaining hours of 2014. Drink some champagne, eat good food, and spend time with your family and friends. But most importantly, get ready..., 58588=The first reason we believe this is that solar provides a competitive, economic advantage over diesel, coal or natural gas, because fossil-fuel prices, even if low at this moment, have proven to be quite volatile over time. \u00a0A recent New Yorker piece on oil prices points out that \"\u2026oil has historically been more volatile than most other commodities; a 2007 study found that in the U.S. it was more volatile than ninety-five per cent of other products.\" The same can't be said of wind or sunlight -- once the capital expenditure for the systems to capture them and convert them to usable energy has been made, the price for fuel is zero. Indefinitely.\u00a0, 85018=Meanwhile, back in fossil fuel land, costs of production aren't getting any cheaper, even if barrel and pump prices (temporarily) have. Oil is expensive to find and to extract. That's why oil companies were cutting their exploration budgets long before the current oil price decline began in mid-2014. Unfortunately, a decline in oil prices does nothing to lower the costs of exploration and production -- \u00a0meaning that \u00a0oil's margins get squeezed., 152550=Essentially the question becomes: how much of the energy we pour into the economy is productive and how much is wasted? According to economists, notably John A. \u201cSkip\u201d Laitner, about 15% of it becomes economically useful while the remaining 85% dissipates unrequited (here is Laitner\u2019s 2013 paper; free registration required)., 86512=Solar will become so inexpensive that it will inevitably continue to gain market share from fossil fuels, starting with those used to generate electricity (coal, then natural gas), and then, as the global economy adapts to make better use of renewable electricity in more sectors (think electric cars), it will displace oil. The popular current question \"when will renewables reach grid parity?\" will seem quaint and even funny in less than a decade. As one report has revealed, \"a recent sign of the progress that solar is making in taking over the world: In 42 of the 50 biggest U.S. cities, home to about 21 million single-family homeowners, solar power is now cheaper than electricity from the power grid.\"[iii] This is happening because, again, as demand increases, so does scale, investment, R&D advances, and declines in installation expense, all of which lead to fast-falling overall costs. Solar PV module costs have declined \"75 per cent since the end of 2009 and the cost of electricity from utility-scale solar PV falling 50 per cent since 2010.\"[iv] Now, reasonable estimates predict that \"Solar Costs Will Fall Another 40% in 2 Years.\"[v], 54450=The International Energy Agency (IEA) has recently written that \"The sun could be the world's largest source of electricity by 2050.\" Mostly, it says, because of declining costs, and not so much because it can help battle climate change, although that could be a growth factor as well., 67792=When the ball drops, we'll hug, kiss, and cheer on all that waits to be discovered in 2015., 46962=\u200bThen the two insurance industry associations, ICMIF and the IIS, representing the majority of insurance companies globally, put out a humdinger. This is an industry that manages a third of the world\u2019s investment capital - approximately $30 trillion. That gets attention. But only $42 billion can be called climate related investment (what have they been doing!). So they announced they would double the industry investment in climate investments to $84 billion by end of 2015. That's good., 41607=The report's author Nathaniel Bullard, told me in an interview that divesting from coal would have been more difficult just three years ago. He says, \u201cUS coal has had clear indicators of future change in place for a while. \u2026 Some coal equities have lost 90% of their value since 2011... This much diminished size means that... the same number of shares will represent a much smaller portion of an investor's overall portfolio relative to 2011.\u201d, 159783=\u201cThe share of biofuels in total use of coarse grains is projected to increase until 2015, reaching 13%\u201d, 67954=We'll sip an old fashioned or two with apple and sage, share some laughs, and maybe even shed a few tears as we remember those we lost in 2014., 68912=Posted by Jeff Siegel at 09:07 AM | Permalink | Comments (0), 108848=By 2040, we'll be at 45%, and by 2050, we'll be well above 70%., 90042=Recently, though, the two types of energy -- oil and solar -- have been trading in tandem, both falling significantly since mid-2014. Traders by and large seem to be thinking \"energy is energy.\" But this \"energy-as-monolith\" view is not appropriate to the reality of the economics, nor is it supported by the fundamentals., 33617=In a 2012 essay entitled \u201cIs Banking Unusually Corrupt, and If So, Why?\u201d Financial analyst, Circuit Court judge and University of Chicago Law School Lecturer Richard A. Posner laid out the reasons why the system might foster unethical behavior., 73663=Seage is enthusiastic about adding water delivery and treatment projects, such as desalination plants, given the growing public worries about drought and depleting groundwater resources in the U.S. He pointed to a 30-year contract totaling $3.4 billion that an Abengoa-led consortium won last year to build and operate wells, collection stations, and pipelines to deliver water from two aquifers to San Antonio. Abengoa expects the project to come online by 2020., 66260=In 2015, bad things will happen., 67330=Whenever I need a little push before venturing off on a new path, I remind myself of that quote. And I wanted to share it with you today because as we head in to 2015, it seems as if fear is weighing on our collective shoulders more than ever., 85297=Like a pundit in the 1960s or 70s predicting that the computers of 2015 would fill entire rooms and be capable of hundreds of calculations per minute, today's observers who believe solar is still an expensive, niche energy source will be proven badly mistaken., 77381=[vii] MacDonald, Gregor, Twitter, December 22, 2014. https://twitter.com/GregorMacdonald/status/547171901227798528\u00a0, 28955=Branch closures in the U.S. hit its all-time highest level in 2013, with 1,487 branch locations closing over the course of 2013.

Generally, global economic conditions, as indicated by some jobs growth, slowly improving industrial output and a housing rebound, improved marginally, but debt crises in Europe and America, exacerbated by eternal dithering, gamesmanship and posturing by politicians and other policy makers on both continents, kept optimism in check and moderated expectations for growth. With respect to the next economy, though, growth and expectations for growth began showing real signs of building momentum as mainstream awareness of the need ensure the longevity of the world economy by changing some of its foundations continued to advance.

The prospectors were disappointed to learn that their claim did not contain uranium but rather flouro-carbonate bastnaesite. This mineral was completely worthless to them but was very interesting to the US Geological Survey. The Geological Survey undertook further surveys and discovered non-radioactive deposit of bastnaesite. One of the two original prospectors who found the deposit worked for MolyCorp (MCP) and he persuaded the company to claim the land although it didn\u2019t exactly know what to do with its rare earth ore.

PV makes electricity instantaneously as sunlight hits it. If the system doesn\u2019t need the energy at that time, more cost-effective systems must be turned down or the PV energy must be sloughed off. On the other hand, although the peak in PV output correlates fairly well with the beginning of the peak demand periods (usually mid-afternoon on hot summer days in this part of the world), the output from the PV system falls off too early to meet the tail of the peak load that extends into the evening (end of peak on the APS system is now 8:00 PM).\u00a0, 798317=Posted by John Petersen at 03:15 AM | Permalink | Comments (2), 280654=On the securities level, we saw once again in 2012 the importance of diversification across all sectors of the next economy. We find it hard to overemphasize this point: the post fossil fuels economy is emerging in all sectors, so to invest as though renewable energy (as critical as it is) is the only aspect of a green economy is shortsighted and results in high volatility. Attempting to represent the entirety of the next economy, our Green Alpha Next Economy Index (GANEX) is invested in 27 sectors and 52 sub-sectors, spanning, we believe, nearly everything required for a broad-based economic system to function.

Each fuel type is shown as a percent of the total fuels consumed. A sharp eye can see a decrease in the amount of liquid fuels used, and an increase in renewables. Still, those renewables will comprise less than 10% of the overall energy picture, even projected 30 years out! Put another way, fossil fuels are expected to account for 80% of the energy consumed in 2040, which is only 5% less than they do now.

Its stock price was beaten down in November on an earnings release. The company showed decent growth in profits and earnings per share since March, but still showed a 25% drop in revenues compared to the same quarter last year.

Because of this, domestic crude oil prices should rise slightly to the $100/barrel range by year\u2019s end, but may peak out at $115/barrel at some point in 2013., 468496=Pessimists will point to forecasts such as those from the Energy Information Administration that project significantly slower growth.\u00a0 The most recent of those very projections just three short years ago forecast consumption for 2010 that now, by EIA\u2019s own numbers, are known to be about 17% low!\u00a0 The problem with forecasts of these types is that they systematically fail to account for future disruptive technologies or significant changes to market conditions. In 2001 it seemed like the days of the dot com were gone as the markets crashed and company after company went out of business.\u00a0 Yet, the greatest value creation on the Web occurred after the dot bomb.\u00a0 I don't believe we are doomed; I believe that technology innovation will enable disruptive changes in our energy production and consumption and I believe the greatest value creation for cleantech companies lies ahead.

Tesla is perhaps the best example of a company that has achieved great commercial success and is being rewarded for this in the financial markets. The company was founded in 2003, went public in 2010 and today trades with an $18 billion market capitalization. Let\u2019s compare this with the value of an established car company: Peugeot was founded in 1810 and produced its first automobile in 1889.

These cars \u2013 referred to as \u201cgreen\u201d vehicles \u2013 use A LOT of rare earth elements in their power trains. Reducing the US\u2019s reliance on foreign oil is one motivation for moving to green cars. However, given the current situation, and unless alternative supply sources are found \u2013 soon \u2013 it appears that the US might be replacing a dependence on one commodity (oil) for reliance on a much more difficult to find and more expensive one (Rare Earth Elements \u2013 REEs). And these REEs are almost exclusively available from its main trade rival. Somewhat belatedly the USA has discovered the looming crisis in rare earth availability and has only recently begun to look at securing domestic supplies and rebuilding its supply chain., 347731=So where are alternative energy stocks likely to go from here? I remain cautious in the short term, concerned that the broader economic picture will overshadow any sector plays. Between the threat of massive tax hikes and spending cuts in the U.S., and the re-fanning of the dangerous debt embers that are smoldering in Europe, I would not be surprised at all by a market correction in the 15% range or worse.

The maximum temperature inside a gas turbine is limited by materials issues, and is pretty well fixed for the purposes of our discussion. Since the hot temperature is essentially fixed, the temperature difference is driven by the temperature of the inlet air: the cooler the inlet air the higher the efficiency.

In 2014 alone, the US is projected to spend about $1.3 trillion on energy.[9] As costs of clean technology have declined, adoption is increasing rapidly. Let\u2019s look at solar photovoltaic (PV) as an example: Since the beginning of 2011, the average price of a solar panel has declined by 60%[10]. As we look further back in time, the declines are more impressive. The price of PV cells has dropped from $76.67 per watt in 1977 to $0.74 per watt in 2013.[11] This has led to a significant increase in PV deployments. PV installations in the US have grown approximately 50% per year from 2011 to 2013.[12] In 2012, renewable energy sources (biomass, geothermal, solar, water, wind) represented half of all new capacity in the US.[13] Towards the end of 2013, BrightSource Energy\u2019s Ivanpah Unit 1 connected to the grid., 217807=Shortly after the report was released \u2014\u00a0and Greenpeace hosted several colorful protests \u2014\u00a0Apple announced it would power its three new data centers in North Carolina, Oregon and California would be fully powered by renewable energy.

It is locally sourcing wind power for its Newark, Calif. center and will do the same with a mix of renewable sources at its Prineville, Ore. center. Its next data center in Reno, Nevada will be powered by onsite geothermal and solar sources., 829074=Saj Karsan EnviroStar (EVI) is a distributor of laundry equipment that has developed a proprietary dry-wet-cleaning machine that avoids the use of perchloroethylene (Perc), a harmful chemical that the International Agency for Research on Cancer has deemed a carcinogen.

EnviroStar's patented Green-Jet process uses an environmentally-friendly, water-based solution that is both non-toxic and requires less energy consumption than traditional dry-cleaning methods., 442266=Last December, I made three predictions for 2011:, 115399=Posted by Debra Fiakas at 11:38 AM | Permalink | Comments (0), 75130=More importantly, when companies (or people) develop awesome products, people want to buy them. For example, Nest Labs has built a learning thermostat that people all over the world want to install in their homes. Their thermostat consistently results in 20% energy savings, but I suspect it\u2019s their phenomenal design and ease-of-use that\u2019s really driving adoption. Nest is a young company \u2013 launched in 2011 \u2013 yet has grown tremendously and is now selling ~50,000 thermostats per month. Impressively, there is evidence that people have been \u201csmuggling\u201d Nest thermostats outside of the US before the company was officially shipping to those countries.[33], 262444=Until recently, oil was a commodity that traded principally on supply and demand, or on the perception of how supplies may be squeezed due to regional conflicts. In the past several years, however, oil prices have turned into a proxy for how traders believe the economy, and thus the stock market, will fare. The logic goes that the more economic activity occurs, the greater oil consumption will be. Since 2009, the price of a barrel of crude oil has been almost exactly correlated to the S&P 500 index., 256021=Despite the gloomy statistics, financial and energy analyst may look back at 2012 as the turnaround year for solar. Many individual companies (particularly the upstream photovoltaic (PV) manufacturers) are facing economic realities of oversupply and falling PV prices, which will ultimately lead to bankruptcies or mergers. According to IHS iSuppli Market Intelligence, the number of PV suppliers is expected to plunge by 70% in 2013. Those left standing, however, will profit immensely, since solar is a white-hat energy source that is likely only at the beginning of its long-term growth story., 759225=Posted by Eamon Keane at 04:47 PM | Permalink | Comments (0), 39932=This article is part of th Renewable Energy World January/February Annual Outlook Issue for 2014, which will be published on February 10, 2014.

Lynn Tabernacki, managing director of renewable and clean energy at Overseas Private Investment Corp. (OPIC) agreed.\u00a0 \u201cIn 2014, solar and wind will remain the mainstay of renewable energy investments because of sustained cost reductions for plant construction using these technologies,\u201d she said., 855030=Sectors like solar, biofuels and smart grid have received a significant overweighting of venture capital investment compared to other sectors. Is this because they are better investment opportunities or because venture capitalists (VCs), being human, invest in what they know and who they know? While many entrepreneurs may not believe it, VCs are human, too. In my last post, \u201cHuman Capital, Not Venture Capital, the Biggest Cleantech Need,\u201d I discussed how the greatest challenge today to growing a successful early-stage cleantech business is the shortage of successful, experienced cleantech entrepreneurs. But finding the right human capital to build great cleantech businesses isn\u2019t the only stumbling block: Human capitalists (VCs) have been limited by their own experiences and networks. At the end of the day, venture capitalists almost always invest first in people. A great, experienced management team can make a business out of an average technology. A bad management team can destroy the most amazing of technologies. Over the past decade, as cleantech VC investment started to expand to more than a handful of specialized funds, VCs naturally turned to their business networks to learn about the sectors, identify opportunities and build management teams. Given that the largest categories of VC investments in the preceding few decades have been in software/web, semiconductors, information technology and pharmaceuticals, these are also the areas where the VCs\u2019 largest network of experienced successful entrepreneurs resided. As crossover entrepreneurs and crossover VCs started to explore or create opportunities, they naturally looked where their knowledge could be most applied. It should not be surprising that the lion\u2019s share of VC investment dollars have been going into areas that have closely related technology foundations to the traditional areas of VC investment. Sectors like solar, smart grid, biofuels and LEDs have received most of the VC dollars and, as a result, increased press hype. The table below highlights the approximate portion of cleantech VC investments in some of these key areas over the past three years. No doubt there are exciting investments to be made in these sectors. Our fund, Access Venture Partners, has invested in both an LED lighting company (TerraLUX) and a smartgrid company (Tendril Networks). But what about sectors like green building materials, industrial energy efficiency, geothermal and nuclear? They serve equally enormous markets (if not larger) and at least in some areas (if not most) have equal or greater potential impact on the economy and the environment. Solar is a particular anomaly, receiving the single largest share of all cleantech venture capital. While sexy because of its elegance, solar is a challenged technology. The economics of solar must struggle against the triple confluence of very low efficiencies, very high costs and the fact the sun simply doesn\u2019t shine much of the time (think night and clouds). No doubt that solar venture investments are targeted at changing those factors \u2013 except for the sun, of course. There are limits to what even VCs can accomplish. But even if the cost of solar cells dropped to zero, solar still would find itself challenged to compete with other renewables, let alone traditional energy, because at least half the system cost is outside of the cells. Geothermal, which unlike solar can be used as \u201cbase load\u201d (meaning that it is always on), is at the other end of the spectrum. There have been few geothermal venture capital investments, yet it has some of the most compelling economics at both the utility and home scale. I would highlight both MIT\u2019s 2006 report on the huge potential of geothermal energy and, of more contemporary interest, the October 2009 issue of Consumer Reports, which showed how a geothermal heat pump\u2019s potential economic return usually outperforms that of a home-based solar thermal system. So why the VC investment preference for solar over geothermal? I\u2019m betting that much of the bias has to do with the fact that not many VCs have strong networks of geologists, drilling technologists, heat pump engineers and steam turbine power generation experts to build great geothermal companies (myself included). While it is certainly important to be knowledgeable and comfortable with the people and technology of a company, VCs must challenge themselves to think outside their own box. If the cleantech market is going to fulfill its full business potential, VCs must push themselves beyond the normal human inclination to stick with what\u2019s familiar. A comfortable investment may not be a great investment. Cleantech VCs need to take a peek over the side of our box. What we see and what we can learn may surprise us.\u00a0, 79980=[6] http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/12/hurricane-sandy-second-costliest_n_2669686.html, 334412=India is set to become the 3rd largest market for wind energy after USA and China and is set to enter the top 10 club of countries in installing solar energy capacity in 2012. Massive power deficits, millions of people without power, billions of dollars in oil, gas and coal imports imply that India offers massive opportunities for renewable energy generation. In fact Indian solar energy represents one of the biggest energy opportunities in the 21st century.

Considering this I feel all stocks, including the alternative energy sector, will have a very positive 2013., 359040=For investors, solar will remain tricky. The most lucrative opportunities in 2013 will continue to be in those small niche tech sectors and in installation. The latter could prove to really launch the SolarCity IPO, so definitely watch that one carefully., 331023=Bottom line: Big US auditors are likely to sever their relations with a growing number of mid-sized and smaller US-listed Chinese firms in 2013 as they face growing pressure to comply with SEC investigations., 361612=Posted by Jeff Siegel at 09:06 AM | Permalink | Comments (0), 831782=The biggest risk to this company may be the way its controlling (and managing) shareholders appear to view public stockholders: as opponents rather than partners. Last December, the controlling shareholders tried to take advantage of a misbehaving market by making a bid for the remainder of the company. The bid, which valued the entire company at $6 million, likely so undervalued the company's assets that it was withdrawn just six days later.

While the company continues to lunch on renewable energy deals, this week it swallowed its biggest meal yet: $3.2 billion for Nest Labs, maker of the Nest smart thermostat and a newer line of smoke/CO2 alarms. (Sorry, anyone who predicted Nest as one of the most anticipated 2014 IPO offerings.) Here's a bit of sunshine for other cleantech investors: the deal means Nest's early VC investors are exiting with 15-20\u00d7 multiples, including a $400 million payday for Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers., 263142=Of course, other factors will contribute to the price of oil in 2013. New drilling technologies are on the rise, giving life to what were thought to be unproductive wells, which will increase supplies. This increased production efficiency, though, has associated environmental issues. Also, the increased production will be more than offset by increased consumption, particularly by developing countries. For example, according to the International Energy Agency, energy consumption in China is likely to double in 10 years from 2008 levels, and triple by 2025!, 447754=I'm not going to sit here today and defend the electric car from all the bogus arguments we hear time and time again from the media whores and partisan slaves.

Here are the highlights from the report and our discussion., 77062=This consumer pull reminds me of the role consumer choice has had in disrupting other industries. For example, the cell phone industry was not particularly exciting back in 1983, despite the launch of the DynaTAC. As cell phones penetrated the work place, they were very much part of a company\u2019s IT system. Companies selected which employees would be eligible for a cell phone and which devices it would support. Then an interesting thing happened: employees started to care about their phones. They started lobbying their IT departments for iPhones. The top-down decision making process was no longer tenable. Employees insisted on choice. Why couldn\u2019t their IT departments just figure out how to support whatever smart phone they wanted to own? As you probably know, this led to the decline of Blackberry (current market cap of $4.5 billion) and the rise of Apple (current market cap of $480 billion[34])., 31893=In addition, in 2014, expect to see more solar installation companies tap into the burgeoning innovations in how to offer their customers low-cost financing options or attractive leasing models to help offset the cost of going solar.\u00a0 (More on financial innovations in the section below.), 580389=Solar PV dominated Japanese clean energy investment in 2010., 766790=Posted by Eamon Keane at 08:38 PM | Permalink | Comments (0), 453850=The move to pony up more nuclear power in the U.S. will continue, although I'm not convinced it'll get very far in 2012.

Simply because short term oil price movementa have little to do with supply and demand, but have instead turned into a proxy for the outlook on the economy, and thus the stock market. Since 2009, the correlation between the S&P 500 and oil prices has been ridiculously tight, 1.00 being a perfect correlation. So when people started gazing over the ever-nearing fiscal cliff, the odds of a recession increased, oil futures dropped and energy stocks tanked., 304827=- PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019 November 2012 report titled \u201cToo late for two degrees?\u201d (N.B., 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) states flatly that \u201c[i]t\u2019s time to plan for a warmer world.\u201d Since, as they conclude, to limit warming to two degrees Celsius, the world needs to begin slowing its carbon dioxide emissions \u201cby 5.1 percent every year from now to 2050, essentially slamming the breaks on [CO2 emissions] growth starting right now,\" is not going to happen, we need to take all realistic mitigation steps we can and also plan for adaptation. Coming as it does from a mainstream accounting and auditing firm with no tree hugger ax to grind, this serves as a particularly stark warning, but also signals the truly massive scale of the investment opportunity. - The National Research Council\u2019s report (via the National Academy) on climate change and national security,\u00a0\u201cClimate and Social Stress: Implications for Security Analysis,\u201d released\u00a0in November 2012, was \u201cprepared at the request of the U.S. intelligence community.\u201d It provides a clear-eyed look at economic and politico-social consequences of climate change.\u00a0 It states, in part, \u201c[a]s a practical matter, [climate change] means that significant burdens of adaptation will be imposed on all societies and that unusually severe climate perturbations will [be] encountered in some parts of the world over the next decade with an increasing frequency and severity thereafter. There is compelling reason to presume that specific failures of adaptation will occur with consequences more severe than any yet experienced, severe enough to compel more extensive international engagement than has yet been anticipated or organized.\u201d When realized, this \u201cmore extensive international engagement\u201d means more opportunities for companies providing solutions, and crucially, in this case, the momentum for economic transition is coming from the security and intelligence community. The more disparate the voices urging transition, the closer to popular inflection we become. - Not to be outdone by the National Academy, the World Bank (also in November 2012) warned that in its opinion, the globe is on track for warming of four degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) if mitigation does not commence immediately. The Bank, in asserting that that kind of warming could devastate the global economy, cited in particular \u201cOcean Acidification,\u201d \u201cHeat Extremes,\u201d \u201cLower agricultural yields,\u201d and \u201cRisks to Human Support Systems.\u201d The Bank concludes by indicating a pressing need for \u201cincreased support for adaptation, mitigation, inclusive green growth and climate-smart development.\u201d - Warren Buffett\u2019s MidAmerican Renewables has been pouring money into renewable energy projects.

As then Joint Chiefs Chairman Admiral Dennis McGinn said, \u201cUltimately, as we gain proficiency in generating sustainable, renewable energy sources as a nation we build national strengths and stability.\u201d How far is the military going with these projects? \u201cThe DOD is positioned to become the single most important driver of the cleantech revolution in the United States,\u201d\u00a0according to Clint Wheelock, president of Pike Research, one of America\u2019s leading pure research firms on the subject of renewable energy. - The insurance industry, which ultimately has to pay every time there\u2019s a new climate disaster, has had enough. Munich RE, a leading global reinsurer whose climate practice releases key reports on the economic risks of climate change, in October wrote (registration required), \"[i]n the long term, anthropogenic climate change is believed to be a signi\ufb01cant loss driver\u2026It particularly affects formation of heatwaves, droughts, thunderstorms and -- in the long run -- tropical cyclone intensity.\" - Reuters recently published a piece explaining \u201cWhy you need a climate change portfolio,\u201d using the cogent argument \u201c[w]hether you believe in man-made global warming or not, it's undeniable that trillions of dollars will be spent on technologies to address the collateral damage of climate change.\u201d We do believe in climate change, so we think there may be reason for all those dollars to flow to the appropriate mitigation and adaptation technologies with even more velocity than Reuters may be assuming. - 350.org\u2019s \u201cFossil Free\u201d institutional divestment campaign is, amazingly, already starting to see some traction. Really. From 350\u2019s website: \u201cSeattle Mayor Mike McGinn sent a letter to the city\u2019s two chief pension funds on friday [sic], formally requesting that they \u2018refrain from future investments in fossil fuel companies and begin the process of divesting our pension portfolio from those companies.\u2019\u201d - Even the slow-to-change traditional investment banking industry is showing signs of tuning into reality. In a blog post on its website, the New York Times cites evidence for \u201cA Change in the Weather on Wall Street,\u201d largely as a result of superstorm Sandy, which impacted Wall Street directly. But in addition, \u201c[t]he other new argument is economic. Until this year, the political calculus about climate change had only one side. The oil and coal companies made sure everyone knew about the costs of action. But few people mentioned the costs of inaction. Now they cannot be ignored.\u201d, 177610=This article was first published on the author's Forbes.com blog, Green Stocks on August 23rd., 55796=The economy is setting up 2014 to be another good year for the stock market. Profits remain adequate, interest rates are low, and most importantly, the U.S. housing market continues to improve. Additionally, price momentum in the stock market is very good, so I expect additional money that retail investors have been keeping on the sidelines to flow in. I doubt growth will match that of 2013, however, since prices and valuations are not as depressed as they were a year ago. This means that even if a company continues to have a good year, comparisons to previous years data will look less impressive., 812007=Since Colorado Governor Bill Ritter recruited my friend Morey Wolfson for the Colorado Governor's Energy Office (GEO) he's had a lot less time to socialize with the rest of us in the clean energy community, but we caught up over lunch during the International Peak Oil Conference in October where I was speaking on investing for a peak oil world, and he is on the advisory board of the sponsoring organization, ASPO-USA., 67507=Is Tesla the only cleantech public market success story? No, not at all. In 2013, we tracked 14 cleantech IPOs including Marrone Bio Innovations (MBII), Silver Spring (SSNI), Control4 (CTRL), BioAmber (BIOA), and Evogene (EVGN). These IPOs and other cleantech public companies have performed exceedingly well. We recently analyzed the 2013 performance of stocks within the Russell 3,000 diversified index and were pleased to discover that Revolution Lighting Technologies (RVLT), SunEdison (SUNE), Solar City (SCTY), and Tesla (TSLA) were among the very top performing stocks in the index:, 454283=Overall, I'm cautiously bullish on 2012., 26473=(Image, right: Global Total Investments in Clean Energy (2004-2012). Credit: Bloomberg New Energy Finance), 703953=Fast forward to 2010, and we find that the demand for rare earths has risen considerably given all of the recent discoveries of additional technological uses for the minerals. Just as REE demand has started to ramp up, China began to restrict exports. The US, like other nations, is scrambling to react and get back in the game. However, ramping up a dormant industry is costly and requires a great deal of time. Obtaining a mining license and the associated environmental permits can be described as a regulatory equivalent of a very long cross country steeple chase., 59520=Posted by Harris Roen at 10:35 AM | Permalink | Comments (0), 284845=The chart below shows the performance of the GANEX, from its inception on December 30, 2008 to the end of 2012, versus two prominent green exchange traded funds, the Guggenheim Solar portfolio (TAN, in gold here), and the PowerShares WilderHill Clean Energy ETF (PBW, the black line). Over this period, the GANEX returned 28.15%, while the TAN was -79.22% and PBW performance was -46.68%. To be clear, GANEX differs significantly from these other two. TAN is a basket of exclusively solar and solar-related stocks, and PBW, though not as sector focused as TAN, is limited primarily (but not exclusively) to renewable energy. GANEX by contrast attempts to capture the entirety of the next economy, including renewable energy and solar, but also everything else we\u2019ll need to have a thriving economic system, including, again, transportation, communications, commerce, infrastructure, materials, energy, agriculture, water and more. So while the comparison with these two may not be exact, we believe it does show the importance of careful diversification into all areas of the emerging green economy. \u00a0, 41114=Posted by Guest Contributor at 09:04 AM | Permalink | Comments (0), 332418=Posted by Doug Young at 09:10 AM | Permalink | Comments (0), 354098=I never forgot that guy. In fact, over the years I had hoped to run into him again, just so I could remind him that not only was I 100% right about and made a fortune as a result of the solar bull market from 2005 to 2008, but that he was also kind of an asshole., 79601=[4] http://world.time.com/2013/09/25/the-cost-of-cleaning-chinas-filthy-air-about-817-billion-one-official-says/, 261625=I have no doubt that energy efficiency companies with good management and strong balance sheets will do well in 2013 and beyond., 255604=Even analysts\u2019 projections for solar earnings have come way down. In 2011, the average EPS estimate for these large solar companies was a meager 0.57 one year out. In 2012, analyst EPS estimates dropped to a very negative average assessment of -1.72. Though depressing, this reality jived with my forecast at the beginning of 2012, where I predicted another year of rough sledding for solar stocks., 382275=Posted by Tom Konrad at 08:41 AM | Permalink | Comments (0), 581802=If all clean energy continues to grow at the current 45% compound rate, Japan will add 11.7 GW of capacity in 2011. Much of this will likely be biomass and wind, so the average capacity factor will be considerably higher than for clean energy just from solar, meaning that this new clean energy generation should be enough to replace the electricity from damaged reactors more than twice over in just one year. Those who think clean energy cannot replace nuclear power should reconsider., 466016=Posted by Jeff Siegel at 07:37 AM | Permalink | Comments (0), 369372=And one assumes big oil will have seen the writing on the wall of the future by now, and be plotting ways to become the masters of the next great sources of energy. I hope that's the case, but other than Total buying a big piece of Sun Power, I've seen no major moves in that direction. In fact, as recently as October 2011, I heard an oil executive at a conference say something very like \"yeah, we tried experimenting with solar in the '70s, but it was just way too expensive to make a decent value proposition,\" as though he thought the audience was credulous and uninformed enough not to know PV efficiency has improved more than 100 times per dollar's worth since then., 24226=The world of renewable energy finance is vast: encompassing everything from venture capital funding for innovative start-ups, to research and development (R&D) and manufacturing expansion spending, to project finance and all the way through to investing in clean energy companies on the stock market. Because of that, for the general public, predicting where money will flow over the course of the next year is a shot in the dark at best. But there are finance experts who spend their lives tracking where the money is and where it isn\u2019t and here we offer you their expert opinions on renewable energy cash flow in 2014., 159186=What\u2019s more, emissions from operations account for only part of Chevron\u2019s impact. The company\u2019s report says, \u201ccombustion of our products resulted in emissions of approximately 364 million metric tons of CO2 in 2012, approximately 8 percent less than the 396 million metric tons emitted in 2011.\u201d Why the decline? Is the fact that people are burning less gas and oil good for the planet but bad for Chevron? The report doesn\u2019t explain., 701188=Until 1948, most of the world\u2019s rare earths were mined in India and Brazil. In the 1950s, South Africa assumed the status of world\u2019s leading rare earth source, but a single mine in the United States eventually overtook South Africa\u2019s production output. From the late 1950s, into the mid-1980s the Mountain Pass rare earth mine in California was the world\u2019s leading producer of REEs., 157551=1. Pay attention to what\u2019s in the report \u2014 and what\u2019s left out. Lots of companies fill their sustainability reports with anecdotes, but these are often off point. Chevron\u2019s 2012 corporate responsibility report says a Chevron executive in Angola is part of \u201ca team that protects endangered turtles that come ashore to breed, dig sandy nests and lay their eggs on the beaches at Chevron\u2019s Malongo oil production facilities.\u201d And we learn that the company has partnered with the Wildlife Conservation Society to \u201cintroduce passive acoustic monitoring in the south Atlantic Ocean to assess humpback whale breeding activity\u201d as it explores for oil., 343068=If you follow the energy sector closely, then you know that many questions regarding the direction of alternative energy companies were looming during the 2012 campaign season. Was the country going to continue with the Obama Administration\u2019s \u201call-of-the-above\u201d strategy with its strong emphasis on renewables, or would there be an accelerated domestic drilling and pipeline bonanza under Republican leadership. When the election finally ended last week, many pundits expected investors to pour money into the beleaguered alternative energy sector resulting in a surge of stock prices. So why, instead, did alternative energy stocks head down?, 566392=Posted by Guest Contributor at 07:55 PM | Permalink | Comments (0), 265596=Another reason I believe stocks will do well in 2013 is that the economy is improving. Unlike the gloomy years of 2009-2011, where a continuum of bad economic news was the rule of the day, 2012 revealed some financial bright spots. These include improved business sentiment, a turnaround in housing, and healthy stock market returns., 458647=Hell, back in 1903, the president of the Michigan Savings Bank told Henry Ford's lawyer, Horace Rackham, that the horse was \u201chere to stay\u201d and the automobile was only a novelty, a fad., 289270=Posted by Garvin at 11:13 AM | Permalink | Comments (0), 229085=Some 44 companies active in alternative energy have reported earnings in January 2013.

Below is a summary of selected earnings results from alternative energy companies that the\u00a0Roen Financial Report\u00a0tracks., 405301=World Clean Power capacity additions in 2011 were 83.5 GW, 59% more than in 2010, at a cost of $141 billion, up only 12% from 2010 levels.\u00a0 In other words, we're getting a lot more energy by only spending a little more.\u00a0 The $59 billion dollars extra that the same amount of capacity would have cost at 2010 prices is pure gain for consumers., 79050=[1] http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/01/07/sunday-final-ratings-family-guy-60-minutes-the-simpsons-bobs-burgers-the-best-of-jimmy-fallon-betrayal-adjusted-down/227214/, 448335=Not including December sales (which we won't see until January), 8,738 LEAFs and 6,142 Volts have been sold in the United States.}",
