An unusual event was that \u201cladder\u201d and \u201cmoney\u201d had exactly the same selections, and \u201crandom\u201d had almost exactly the reverse of those (except for the Bulldogs-Lions match, where it followed them in tipping the Lions; the Bulldogs won). In the end, \u201chome\u201d got 6 hits, \u201cmoney\u201d and \u201cladder\u201d got 5 and \u201crandom\u201d got only 2.

With only five weeks left until the end of the \u201chome and away\u201d season, it is pretty clear that (a) no strategy is a clear money-winner, and (b) the performance of all strategies doesn\u2019t seem to change that much as the season advances. I\u2019ll do a more detailed analysis after the end of the season, though.
