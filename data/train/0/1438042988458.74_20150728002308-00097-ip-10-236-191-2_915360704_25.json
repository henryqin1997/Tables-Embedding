I know that if i was placed in a large school with plenty of partying and everything i would be completely distracted from my studies so Dominican is the perfect fit for me. Tips for prospective students The only thing that needs to be watched out for in Dominican is the fact that it is indeed a small school which means that it is easy to get caught up in rumors and high school drama but it is also easy to extricate yourself from all of those situations. The benefit of going to a small school is that you are actually a person to everyone rather than just a number or a student ID. Everyone is pretty close and its a real community. Bang for the buck",
