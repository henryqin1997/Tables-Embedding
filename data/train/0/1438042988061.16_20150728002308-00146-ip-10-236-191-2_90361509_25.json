The prices are merely provided as a general guideline. Lowering rent/shop prices will lower your income, from that property, by 50%. Raising prices to high will increase income by 150% and setting them to highest will yield a 200% increase from normal. Shops and stalls will yield an income(shop sales) of around 3% of the purchase price. Homes will yield an income(rent) of 3.6% when at 100% condition, which gradually declines as its condition worsens, until it reaches 0% and tenants stop paying rent. Homes have a\u00a0% listed that signifies the condition of that property. Once this number becomes 0% you will not collect rent from that property unless you repair it, either from the Sanctuary or visiting the property directly and interacting with the plate outside the home. Shops and stalls do not have a\u00a0% condition attribute. Except for remodeling, you do not need to physically go to the building. Everything can easily be",
