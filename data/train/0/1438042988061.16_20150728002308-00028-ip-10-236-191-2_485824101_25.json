    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{289936=Example message: \u201cConflicting schedule change: \u2018Buffy, The Vampire Slayer\u2019 is rescheduled to 8:00 p.m. The new schedule conflicts with Mary Jones' scheduled recording of \u201cDukes of Hazzard.\u201d You have thirty seconds to respond. Receiving no response, the default procedure is to record \u2018Buffy, The Vampire Slayer.\u2019 Should the recording schedule default to \u2018Buffy, The Vampire Slayer?\u2019 Your response (Y/N): ______.\u201d This message has a message point in PVR operations just after the PVR downloads a broadcast schedule from a content source and compares the broadcast schedule to the recording schedules 272 in the show records 240. In this example, there are two owners, one for \u2018Buffy,\u2019 another for \u2018Dukes.\u2019 The message is directed to the owner having the higher privilege level. The message includes a default action, in this example, recording the show belonging to the user having the higher privilege level. The PVR reads the owners' privilege levels from field 194 in their respective user profiles 202. There are two titles concatenated into the message, both from the title fields 241 a in the respective show records 240 for the two shows. There are two schedules, one for each show, but they are either identical or overlapping, so that this particular example message only includes one of them, but it can be read by the PVR from either schedule field 272 in the show record 240 for either show. This message is implemented as a \u2018send,\u2019 synchronous and blocking during the timeout period of thirty seconds. This message resolves a conflict among users on the basis of privilege level. There are many, many ways of resolving such conflicts, as will occur to those of skill in the art, and all such ways are well within the scope of the present invention., 186752=PVRs can be programmed to accept scheduling entries for shows or expressions of group preferences from all group members or less than all. The example data structure for member records 2106 includes a Boolean field AuthorizedRep 2110 in which is stored an indication whether the member represented by the member record 2106 is authorized to schedule shows and assert preferences on behalf of the group., 227116=Reversing 2606 the current apportionment of the loan includes scanning through the loan records 230 for the related show and, for the member identified in each member loan record, decrementing a member's BorrowedSpace 208 by the LoanAmount 236 for that member and incrementing a member's FreeSpace 206 by the LoanAmount 236 for that member. Then, because the method at this point is not canceling the loan entirely, only the member loan record for the member opting out is deleted 2608., 236071=DisplayStartTime 2754 and DisplayStopTime 2756, in the viewing records 250, record display start time and display stop time respectively for a display period for a show identified in ShowID 252 for a particular user as identified in ViewerID 254. The amount of used space that has been displayed for the show to the user can be stored in DisplayedSpace 2764 or can be calculated on the fly as described below., 194156=The method includes also creating show records when shows are identified for preference recording 2154 on the basis of indications of member preference 2150. Members are users, and users, as described in detail above, are supported by PVRs of the present invention in data entry of indications of user preference, including, for example, entry into user preference records 320 users' indications of preferred show titles 324 and preferred actors 326, as well as users' indications of the relative intensity with which such preferences are asserted, as, for example, in the preference level field at reference 328., 287665=Example message: \u201cNon-conflictive schedule change: \u2018Buffy, The Vampire Slayer\u2019 is rescheduled to 8:00 p.m. The new schedule presents no conflicts with other shows. Recording will proceed at the new time.\u201d This message has a message point in PVR operations just after the PVR downloads a broadcast schedule from a content source and compares the broadcast schedule to the recording schedules 272 in the show records 240. The message is directed to the user identified in the ownerID field 244 in the show record 240. The title 241 a also is from the show record. This message is implemented as a \u2018post,\u2019 asynchronous, non-blocking, not requesting a control response from the user to whom the message is directed., 147196=Record 440 shows an estimated initial raw compression level 422 in the source stream of 80:1 estimated on the basis of encoding according to MPEG-2, colorspace size 4:4:4 or \u201848,\u2019 frame rate 428 of 30 frames/second, resolution of 1930\ufffd1080 pixels (an HDTV standard), with \u2018High\u2019 audio quality 432. Record 440 is shown with a relative compression of (1) with respect to itself., 275636=Among embodiments that leave a show fragmented among more than one video file, recording is simplified by reducing, or even eliminating, the need to further compress the first video file to the compression level of the second video file and concatenate the two files. On the other hand, decoding a show for display is easier if the show is encoded at record time into a single video file, because there is no need during playback to track and change video files, change codec parameters, or change codecs. In addition, further compressing the first video file at record time increases the amount of free space made available by changing to a higher compression level. Some increases in compression level, such as, for example, changes in audio quality, have no effect on video playback quality, although they may affect other aspects of playback. Nevertheless, leaving the show fragmented in more than one file having more than one compression level may affect display quality if the show is later replayed, changing display quality when playback changes from the first video file to the second video file, particularly when changes in resolution or frame rate were required in order to effect a particular increase in compression level., 194844=A show 240 to be recorded on behalf of a group 2102 has stored in its OwnerID field 244 the group ID of the group on whose behalf the show is to be recorded. In such embodiments, that group, rather than any individual user, is considered the owner of such a show., 487833=To explain operation of this pseudocode, assume that showID identifies a show titled \u201cBuffy, The Vampire Slayer\u201d scheduled to record at 5:00 p.m. with a deficit of 5 megabytes, a default of choice number 1 and a timeout period of thirty seconds. Assume that there are six commands identified by command records 4416 for the message identified by MessageID, the commands indexed on sequence number and having respectively the following ChoiceStrings 4480:, 298732=Messages can be transmitted to wireless pagers identified by telephone numbers. Messages can be transmitted by a PVR application over, for example, the Simple Network Paging Protocol or \u2018SNPP,\u2019 version 3 of which is an enhanced, two-way protocol as defined in RFC1861. RFC1861 is an Internet protocol suite specification document promulgated by the Network Working Group in the Internet Engineering Task Force., 147640=The target records, records 442 through 450, illustrated compression levels supported by an exemplary PVR with respect to a video source of the kind represented in the source record 440. Record 442, for example, shows an estimated absolute compression level 422 of 480:1, or a compression level of (4) relative to the source stream, estimated on the basis of encoding according to MPEG-2, colorspace size \u201848,\u2019 frame rate 428 of 30 frames/second, resolution of 720\ufffd480 pixels (an NTSC video standard), with \u2018High\u2019 audio quality 432. In other words, recompressing the source stream using a resolution reduced from 1930\ufffd1080 (HDTV) to 720\ufffd480 (a high quality of NTSC video) reduced projected space requirement for a subject show by a factor of six. This is a useful demonstration of the fact that, although algorithmic compression alone can result in absolute compression ratios in the range of approximately 100 to 200, reductions in parameters other than compression technique as such, factors such as, for example, colorspace, frame rate, resolution, and audio quality, can result in very large overall compression levels., 175619=The selecting is carried out in dependence upon the deficit amount 1512. That is, for example, a lender is selected who has authorized lending of at least the deficit amount and who has free space at least equal to the deficit amount. Alternatively, if no single lender has sufficient free space and sufficient lending authorized, several lenders may be selected, until the lenders' aggregate free space and maximum loan amount authorizing lending to the borrower are at least equal to the deficit amount., 235669=DisplayStartTime 2750 and DisplayStopTime 2752 record display start time and display stop time respectively for a display period for a show 240. The amount of used space that has been displayed for the show can be stored in DisplayedSpace 2766, or the amount of displayed space can be calculated on the fly as described in more detail below., 148845=Record 444 shows an estimated absolute compression level 422 of 960:1 and a relative compression of (12) with respect to the source stream, achieved by reducing the size of the colorspace 426 from 48 to 24, that is, for example, from 4:4:4 to 4:2:4. Record 446 shows an increase in relative compression to approximately (48) through an additional reduction in resolution 430. Record 448 shows an estimated relative compression level of (100) from changing encoding 424 to MPEG-1 and reducing audio quality 432. Record 450 shows an estimated relative compression level (140) estimated from an additional change in encoding 424 to MJPEG and an additional reduction in audio quality 432., 69793=Codec functions include compression and decompression. When show is encoded, it is converted to a compressed format suitable for storage or transmission; when it is decoded it is converted to a non-compressed (raw) format suitable for presentation. Each codec has certain input formats that it can handle and certain output formats that it can generate. In some situations, a series of codecs are used to convert from one format or compression level to another., 184405=Groups' authorized representatives can schedule recordings of shows for groups in the same way that shows are scheduled for users, for example, by creation of a show record effected through a user interface. More particularly, a show 240 scheduled to be recorded on behalf of a group 2102 has stored in its OwnerID field 244 the group ID of the group on whose behalf the show is scheduled to be recorded. In such embodiments, that group is considered the owner of such a show., 288451=Example message: \u201cConflicting schedule change: \u2018Buffy, The Vampire Slayer\u2019 is rescheduled to 8:00 p.m. The new schedule conflicts with your scheduled recording of \u201cDukes of Hazzard.\u201d You have thirty seconds to respond. Receiving no response, the default procedure is to record the \u2018Dukes of Hazzard.\u2019 Should the recording schedule default to \u2018Dukes of Hazzard?\u2019 Your response (Y/N): ______.\u201d This message has a message point in PVR operations just after the PVR downloads a broadcast schedule from a content source and compares the broadcast schedule to the recording schedules 272 in the show records 240. The message includes a default action, in this example, recording the show originally scheduled for the slot in question. The message is directed to the user identified in the ownerID field 244 in the show record 240 for either show, because the same user \u2018owns\u2019 both shows. There are two titles concatenated into the message, both from the title fields 241 a in the respective show records 240 for the two shows. There are two schedules, one for each show, but they are either identical or overlapping, so that this particular example message only includes one of them, but it can be read by the PVR from either schedule field 272 in the show record 240 for either show. This message is implemented as a \u2018send,\u2019 synchronous and blocking during the timeout period of thirty seconds., 264485=The highest supported compression level, in this example context, is \u201820480:1.\u2019 \u2018Highest supported compression level\u2019 means the highest level for which a PVR has a codec capable of handling the show's present encoding as an input and producing a more compressed encoding of video as output. In this example context, such a \u2018highest supported compression level\u2019 is indicated in record 614 of table 602. As long as the show's original compression level is less than a highest supported compression level, the show is a candidate for further compression. In this example, as among several candidate shows, selecting a show for further compression includes selecting the first show among the candidates having an original compression level lower than a highest supported compression level in a particular PVR according to an embodiment of the present invention., 146678=The example records in table 420 show several examples of compression level 422 estimated on the basis of the factors affecting compression. The compression levels are shown in absolute terms and then in parenthesis relative to a video source bit stream. Table 420 is organized with respect to an HDTV source having an initial resolution 430 of 1930\ufffd1080. Table 602 is organized with respect to an NTSC source having an initial resolution of 720\ufffd480., 68446=\u201cCinepak\u201d is a popular codec originally developed by SuperMac, Inc., 203545=The exemplary reapportionment record 2174 provides a UserID field 280 storing a user ID of one of the member to whom the show's storage space requirement is to be reapportioned. The exemplary reapportionment record 2174 also provides a reapportionment amount field 282 storing the portion of the show's space requirement to be reapportioned to the member identified in the UserID field 280 of the reapportionment record 2174., 160170=Assume that the initial bit rate for a 30 minutes show, a video download for example, is 150 kilobits/second, which would be fairly high quality video at MPEG-1. Thirty minutes is 1800 seconds, the duration of the show. 150,000 multiplied by 1800 is 270 megabits total space requirement, divided by 8 bits/byte is about 34 megabytes for the show's storage space requirement. This show is downloaded with quite a lot of compression, and the storage space requirement is definitely an estimate., 113399=The schedule 272 is a data element for storing the broadcast schedule of the show represented by the show record 240. For example, the schedule field 272 can be encoded with a date and time when a television show is broadcast and therefore to be recorded. The record period 274 provides an indication of a period over which a show may be recorded many times. For example, schedule 272 can be encoded with a schedule indication of Wednesday, 7:00 p.m., and record period 274 can be encoded with \u2018January through June,\u2019 resulting in recording the indicated show weekly for six months., 422189=PVRs according to embodiments of the present invention carry out frequent classification operations. Some kind of classification typically is carried out every time a message point is encountered during normal operation. For every message point, a PVR typically carries out classifications such as determining whether to transmit a message, whether to transmit a post or a send, which commands to include, which command is to be the default, and so on. Training, on the other hand, occurs less often. A training routine can be scheduled hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or at any time that makes sense in terms of overall PVR performance. Training can be run at midnight or 4:00 a.m., when most users are asleep and there is little chance that execution of a training routine will slow normal PVR operations. Because classification occurs often and training need not occur often, readers will observe in this disclosure a design bias, or strategy, rather, in favor of offloading complexity from classification to training., 78854=\u201cMPEG-2\u201d addresses issues directly related to digital television broadcasting, such as the efficient coding of field-interlaced video and scalability. MPEG-2's target bit-rate is higher than MPEG-1's, between 4 and 9 Mb/sec, resulting in potentially very high video quality. MPEG-2 is based upon \u2018profiles\u2019 and \u2018levels.\u2019 The profile defines bitstream scalability and colorspace resolution, while the level defines image resolution and maximum bit-rate per profile. Probably the most common descriptor in use currently is \u2018Main Profile, Main Level\u2019 (MP@ML), which refers to 720\ufffd480 resolution video at 30 frames/sec, at bit-rates up to 15 Mb/sec for NTSC video. Another example of an MPEG-2 descriptor in common use is the HDTV resolution of 1920\ufffd1080 pixels at 30 frames per second, at bit-rates up to 80 megabits per second. This HDTV example is a \u2018Main Profile, High Level\u2019 (MP@HL) descriptor. A complete table of the various legal combinations can be found in reference2.}",
