(\u201cION\u201d), the licensee of station WEPX-TV, channel 51, Greenville, North Carolina, requesting the substitution of channel 26 for channel 51 at Greenville. After the Commission instituted a freeze on the acceptance of rulemaking petitions by full power television stations requesting channel substitutions in May 2011, it later announced that it would lift the freeze to accept petitions for rulemaking filed by full power television stations seeking to relocate from channel 51 pursuant to a voluntary relocation agreement with Lower 700 MHz A Block licensees. ION has entered into a voluntary relocation agreement and further states that the proposed channel 26 facility will increase the net total population served by the station by over 100,000 persons, which will serve the public interest., 784511=In this document, the Audio Division, at the request of Bowen Broadcasting, allots FM Channel 228A as a first local service at Summit, Mississippi. To accommodate that allotment, the Audio Division reclassifies Station WQUE-FM, New Orleans, Louisiana, to specify operation on FM Channel 227C0 rather than FM Channel 227C. With that reclassification, Channel 228A can be allotted at Summit, consistent with the minimum distance separation requirements of the Commission's rules, at coordinates 31-17-07 NL and 90-19-10 WL, at a site 14.2 km (8.8 miles) east of the community See Supplementary Information infra., 27816=At the request of Red Wolf Broadcasting Corporation, the Audio Division amends the FM Table of Allotments, by allotting Channel 233A at Sagaponack, New York, as the community's first local service.

Channel 277A can be allotted at Knox City, Texas, in compliance with the Commission's minimum distance separation requirements at a site with reference coordinates of 33-33-08 North Latitude and 99-49-38 West Longitude. See SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION infra., 1051233=In this document, the Commission adopts rules to implement the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (\u201cCALM\u201d) Act. Among other things, the CALM Act directs the Commission to incorporate into its rules by reference and make mandatory a technical standard, developed by an industry standards development body, that is designed to prevent digital television commercial advertisements from being transmitted at louder volumes than the program material they accompany. As mandated by the statute, the rules apply to digital TV broadcasters, digital cable operators, and other digital multichannel video programming distributors (\u201cMVPDs\u201d). Also per the statute, the rules will take effect one year after adoption, and will therefore be effective as of December 13, 2012. The rules adopted are designed to protect viewers from excessively loud commercials and, at the same time, permit broadcasters and MVPDs to implement their obligations in a minimally burdensome manner. The Commission will require broadcast stations and MVPDs to ensure that all commercials are transmitted to consumers at the appropriate loudness level in accordance with the industry standard., 283143=The Commission has before it a petition for rulemaking filed by WLAJ-TV LLC, the licensee of station WLAJ-TV, channel 51, Lansing, Michigan, requesting the substitution of channel 25 for channel 51 at Lansing.

WLAJ-TV LLC has entered into such a voluntary relocation agreement with T-Mobile USA, Inc. and states that operation on channel 25 would eliminate potential interference to and from wireless operations in the adjacent Lower 700 MHZ A Block., 648830=The Commission has before it a petition for rulemaking filed by LeSEA Broadcasting of South Bend, Inc. (\u201cLeSEA\u201d), the licensee of station WHME-TV, channel 48, South Bend, Indiana, requesting to return to its previously allotted channel 48 at South Bend. On March 2, 2010, the Commission substituted channel 46 for channel 48 at LeSEA's request; however, LeSEA now asserts that it will neither serve the public interest nor make economic or technical sense to expend resources to build WHME-TV's channel 46 facility., 18652=The Audio Division amends the FM Table of Allotments, by allotting Channel 277A at Shelter Island, New York, as the community's first local service.

In addition, according to ION, this channel substitution serves the public interest as it will increase the station's service area by almost 100,000 persons., 809628=This document requests comments on a Petition for Rule Making filed by S and H Broadcasting, LLC, proposing the substitution of Channel 228C2 for vacant Channel 286C2 at Ehrenberg, Arizona. The proposed channel substitution at Ehrenberg accommodates the contingent hybrid application that requests the city of license modification for Station KRSX-FM, from Channel 287A, Twentynine Palms, California, to Channel 286A, North Shore, California. A staff engineering analysis indicates that Channel 228C2 can be allotted to Ehrenberg, Arizona consistent with the minimum distance separation requirements of the Commission's Rules with a site restriction located 11.1 kilometers (6.9 miles) east of Ehrenberg. In this regard, the Audio Division, on its own motion, modifies the reference coordinates for proposed Channel 228C2 at Ehrenberg, Arizona to the least restricted site. The reference coordinates are 33-36-54 NL and 114-24-14 WL. Channel 228C2 at Ehrenberg is located within 320 kilometers (199 miles) of the U.S.-Mexican border, so concurrence by the Government of Mexico is required. Mexican concurrence has been requested for this vacant allotment, but has not yet been received., 895593=This document announces the effective date of rules published in the Federal Register on June 23, 2004.

The purpose of the channel substitution is to accommodate the \u201chybrid\u201d application requesting to upgrade the facilities of Station KXDJ(FM) from Channel 252C2 to Channel 252C1 at Spearman, Texas, File No. BPH-20140519AHY., 208083=The Commission has before it a petition for rulemaking filed by TDS Broadcasting LLC (\u201cTDS\u201d), the licensee of KOHD, channel 51, Bend, Oregon, requesting the substitution of channel 18 for channel 51 at Bend. While the Commission instituted a freeze on the acceptance of full power television rulemaking petitions requesting channel substitutions in May 2011, it subsequently announced that it would lift the freeze to accept such petitions for rulemaking seeking to relocate from channel 51 pursuant to a voluntary relocation agreement with Lower 700 MHz A Block licensees. TDS has entered into such a voluntary relocation agreement with T-Mobile USA, Inc. and states that operation on channel 18 would remove any potential interference with authorized wireless operations in the adjacent Lower 700 MHZ A Block., 232836=In this document, the Commission proposes to expand to cable operators, satellite TV providers, broadcast radio licensees, and satellite radio licensees the requirement that public inspection files be posted to the FCC's online database. In 2012, the Commission adopted online public file rules for broadcast television stations that required them to post public file documents to a central, FCC-hosted online database rather than maintaining the files locally at their main studios. Now that television broadcasters have completed their transition to the online file, the Commission believes it is appropriate to commence the process of expanding the online file to other media entities to extend the benefits of improved public access to public inspection files and, ultimately, reduce the burden of maintaining these files.}",
