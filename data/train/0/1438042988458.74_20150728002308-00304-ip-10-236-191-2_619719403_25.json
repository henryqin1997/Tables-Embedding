            "The Italian DEM for gravity terrain corrections was resampled to 30\" gridding by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, following a joint design by NOAA and the Servizio Geologico Nazionale of Italy.",
            "The DCW hypsography was converted to 30\" latitude-longitude grids by the U. S. Geological Survey. Prototyping of techniques also involved University College London. The ANUDEM contour-to-grid software of Australian National University was used, which incorporates streamlines to help guide the gridding process. The other cartographic source materials were also converted to grids by the same general methods. Those other sources, which were originally in hardcopy format, were adapted for input to this processing by the Geographical Survey Institute of Japan. The exception is the Antarctic Digital Database, which was also in digital format.",

            "The AUSLIG elevation point file was interpolated to a 30 arc-second gridfile using the GRASS-GIS function s.surf.idw (using 3 nearest points). This work was done at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, under an agreement with AISLIG, to produce a model for use in GLOBE.",
            "The Zwally/NSIDC DEM for Greenland was resampled to 30 arc-seconds by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and blended with other data where available. The latter blended data were removed for transmittal to the GLOBE Task Team for GLOBE assembly, as they were unneeded.",
            "All candidate data sets for GLOBE were evaluated, and blended using GRASS-GIS' function r.patch (with appropriate masking to avoid incorporating the wrong parts of candidates into the model."
