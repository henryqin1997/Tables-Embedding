Plus, freshmen have curfew (1 a.m), 129298=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 104724=The food for the first two weeks is amazing. Then after that you just dread it! There's no menu so you won't know whats for dinner until you get there. I'm saying it was amazing the first two weeks because I was not here spring semester 2013. You will get sick of the food very quickly. It's the same stuff all the time. The food on the weekend veeeerrrrryyyyyy bad. I don't go to the cafe on the weekends because it is so disappointing. Invest in a refrigerator!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Make friends with your admissions counselor! Everyone in admissions is happy to talk to you about anything. However, you need to show them that you are interested by asking questions. Confirm that they received your application, pastoral recommendation, etc. Bang for the buck Nyack is a lot cheaper than most schools. Make sure you ask a lot of questions about financial aid though! They cannot help you unless you ask! Am enjoying being here I love Nyack so much! I transferred here from Messiah College. This school really fit my needs. It was just far away enough for me to be independent, but it was close enough for me to go home when I needed to go home! Am learning a lot I am not just learning a lot academically, but spiritually as well! Nyack has taught me how to be independent in my faith. I have learned how to think like an adult and apply my knowledge to my faith, and vice versa! Login to rate or flag the reviews Lauren from Dublin, PA",
