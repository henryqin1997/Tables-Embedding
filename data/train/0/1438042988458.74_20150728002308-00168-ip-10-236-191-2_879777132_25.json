For more information on the APIs listed in this article, see the Platform SDK documentation or the .NET\u00a0Framework SDK documentation in the MSDN\u00ae library. In this article, the Microsoft\u00ae Win32\u00ae functions are organized by category. Each Win32 function that is listed belongs to only one category, and each category is presented in its own table. An alphabetical list of the Win32 categories is provided, as well as a hierarchical list. To locate a Win32 function, select the appropriate category from one of the category lists or search the article for the name of the function. If you do not find the Win32 function that you are seeking, it means that no equivalent .NET\u00a0Framework API exists in the .NET\u00a0Framework version 1.0 or 1.1 or that the Win32 function and the relevant .NET\u00a0Framework API were inadvertently omitted from the list. Summary: This article identifies the Microsoft .NET\u00a0Framework version 1.0 or 1.1 APIs that provide similar functionality to Microsoft Win32 functions. One or more relevant .NET\u00a0Framework APIs are shown for each Win32 function listed. The intended audience for this article is experienced Win32 developers who are creating applications or libraries based on the Microsoft .NET\u00a0Framework, but anyone looking for a managed counterpart for a Win32 function could find this document useful.
