However, the processing apparatus 18 can also generate the matching pattern based on the structured/hierarchical contents adjacent to the target content. The generation of the matching pattern based on the adjacent structured/hierarchical contents may be implemented (a) only when there are no past content portions with respect to the target content or (b) regardless of the existence of the past content portions with respect to the target content. For example, the business article page on the home page of Asahi Shimbun (www.asahi.com) includes a date in the URL as follows, and can be browsed together with up-to-date business articles for a predetermined period including the present.
