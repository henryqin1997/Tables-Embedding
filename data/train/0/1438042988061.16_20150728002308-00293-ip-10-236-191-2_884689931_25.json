            "Subway, McDonald's and taco bell aren't necessarily the best choice for food, but on a college budget they are OK. Luckily there is a pretty good pizza place in the tivoli and since it is located downtown it is easy to get to better food choices.",
            "Haven't experienced the dorm life, but from what i've heard it's pretty fun.",
            "Challenging but not too difficult it makes you want to quit.",
            "Always get your textbooks early, and rent or buy used rather than buying new ones. Get your walking shoes on, it is a large campus! Don't put school work off until the last minute, a lot of courses are designed to slowly build up to larger projects, so it is fairly easy to keep up with them.",
            "Metropolitan State College of Denver has experienced and involved staff. They are a great education for an extremely reasonable price. Metro State is also conveniently located in downtown Denver so it is easy to get to and culturally diverse."

It is located downtown on a campus shared by CUD and CCD (higher ed schools) completing what is called the Auraria Campus. Amenities include lite rail transportation, public library and easy access to food nearby., 528610=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 127604=Register on the day registration is available. If you take loans, complete everything in April or you will want to kick yourself in August. This isn't high school. The academic work is more challenging but the experience definitely is not. Show up, pay attention, and leave. College is only as hard as you make it., 149530=When I visited this school in March of 2012, I was shocked by the huge campus and the amazing campus amenities (Starbucks on campus? Oh, yeah!). Everyone I met there was so nice and helpful, even the student who had nothing to gain from helping me out. In short, this school seems like a great one and I can't wait to attend!, 120158=If you are willing to push yourself, you can make even the freshman level classes as hard as you want. I had papers that were supposed to be about 1200 words for English comp, but I talked with my teacher to get extended time and ended up writing pieces about 3000 words in length. Now, those papers are being submitted to editors and publisher and will hopefully be in the hands of the public sometime soon! =P, 148771=While I am not currently enrolled in this school, from what I can tell of my March visit here, the academic rigor is above average, because of the wonderful teachers employed by the school and the inventive and original curriculum's they have put together.}",

Tips for prospective students If you don't mind the big moving school then it's for you. They offer a lot of great programs there. It might not be the whole dorm living college but there is still a lot of life there. Bang for the buck For being such a big school its really cheap.
