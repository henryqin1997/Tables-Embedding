These clubs can also serves as a time off school and a time to forget about the stress due to works of school load. I became a member of the Student Senate on the 24th of September 2013; i have learned about Students Health Insurance status at our school and more. Such clubs gives you the opportunity to know inside issues that go on behind the scenes in your school., 159340=The hallway outside the book store. I named this hallway rock and roll Jazz. Every time you walk through this hallway music turns on and accompany you until you exit. Apart from this unusual location on campus, I would like to acknowledge the our Trio special basket of quotes. This basket is full of strips of papers of quotes, Every morning i walk into the office just to pick my quote of the day hoping for a new and invigorating inspiration. These pieces of paper may seem ordinary, but the words written on them have made a difference in every hour i spend at Rochester Community College. For example last Friday the 27th 2013, i picked a piece of paper that read live today with harmony; throughout the day i contemplated on these words no matter the circumstances to live the day in peace and harmony instead of stress., 106165=The academic Rigor in Rochester Community College is by pushing yourself beyond what is easy. We have a study place in school called the learning center, were students go to do their homework's and tutors are there for any questions. People who go to the learning center get good grades more than students who don't go there at all. I was never good in Math. With the help of the learning center of RCTC, I was able to get a Chemistry tutor and ended up doing well in the class with 88.9% in the class. I was nervous going through the class but I never gave up. My academic performance had improved immensely, I manage to be on the Dean List of RCTC of fall 2011., 212565=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
