            "As a freshmen you live in a three floor building. I live on the third floor with about 18 other girls. One side of the hallway is single rooms and the other side is doubles with one triple. You have a resident assistant who also lives on your floor who you can go to for any needs and they also decorate the floor and coordinate small floor programs for you.",

            "I am a speech pathology major and I would recommend anyone that is in that field to this school. It is a small school and the education here is very good.",
            "The class sizes are small, which makes for a better learning experience. The professors are all extremely helpful and are a big part of our success. The new campus center building is very impressive and a highlight for the school."

And once you've enrolled at Stockton, remember to join at least one or two clubs, organizations, or sports teams. :), 81359=Stockton is a great college to attend if your not quite sure what direction your headed in. It will help you explore many areas of study and you'll have a great time doing so. Recently in 2011, Stockton opened up a new campus center which is great to hang out in with friends to play games, study, relax and watch t.v., or get some food.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Colleen from Ringwood, NJ 12/20/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 5 out of 7 people found this review useful. 2 of 87 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Stockton College is a GREAT science school. It is also a good business school. I would also recommend Stockton for anyone who doesn't want to enter a huge college. Stockton is on the small side, and is very comfortable. It has changed my life, and I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. Tips for prospective students I would definitely recommend on going to the SOAR program the weekend before school starts. I met three of my best friends during that program. I would also recommend going to all the activities they have during the first week of school. It really helps you feel more comfortable in your new surroundings. Take classes you think you will enjoy, but also take classes you've never really heard of. College is all about experiencing new things, and Stockton definitely gives every student that opportunity. Bang for the buck",
