(To be precise, it\u2019s pages 129-256 of a 262-page book.) The chapter has 51 subsections, one for each state and the District of Columbia. Forty-nine of the subsections include nine actual tables each, presented as seven tables (as in Chapters 2-19, I save space on expense/budget tables by combining two sets of metrics into a single displayed table). The District of Columbia and Hawaii each have a single public library district, so I just provide the key figures for each one, not tables with all but one row on each table empty., 2881=The first table in each state subsection, breaking libraries down by expenditures per capita, adds one column to those in chapters 2-19: AdjBR. That\u2019s the median Benefit Ratio (BenR) for libraries in that expenditure category\u2014but adjusted by the state\u2019s cost of living as I found it reported for 2010. Thus, if the cost of living was 135.1% (California), AdjBR would be 35.1% higher than BenR (e.g., the median adjusted Benefit Ratio for the 18 California libraries spending $26 to $30.99 is 4.13 rather than 3.06)., 6505=Why does this essay get its own issue? Because I\u2019ve already written most of another essay (more words than this one, but possibly requiring fewer pages)\u2014and that one really needs to appear with yet another one, much shorter. Both of those should be done some time in November and I want to get them out. The combined issue would be way too long\u2014thus, a special short one-essay issue. (A quick note on layout: Because this essay contains so many short sections, I\u2019m neither turning on vertical justification nor making any real effort to compress vertical space. Columns end irregularly\u2014and tables break across columns but not pages.)}",

A few things stand out even with the small group of libraries\u2014e.g., the best-funded library (the only one with at least $53 spending per capita, and just barely above that mark) has nearly twice the circulation of the median for any other expenditure category and two-thirds more than the next-best 75%ile. That library isn\u2019t highest for any of the other metrics. Delaware Since there\u2019s only one library system (serving 601,723 people), there\u2019s not a lot to say.

    "textAfterTable": "Florida Like California (but more so), Florida has relatively few libraries and systems for its population: 80 (all in the tables, none omitted). Funding tends toward the low side, with only 5% in the top two brackets and 21% in the top four, compared to 30% in the bottom two brackets and 59% in the bottom four. Similarly, circulation per capita tends toward the low side, with only 11% having at least 10 circ per capita (38% overall)\u2014and patron visits are similar, with 20% having six or more (42% overall). I could say that it\u2019s noteworthy that the median circulation for libraries in the highest spending bracket is nearly twice that of the second highest\u2014but with only two libraries in each of those two brackets, that\u2019s not especially meaningful (although those are the only brackets where even the 75%ile is at least 10 circ per capita). Program attendance is quite low, with 65% having less than 0.3 attendance per capita (compared to 46% overall).
