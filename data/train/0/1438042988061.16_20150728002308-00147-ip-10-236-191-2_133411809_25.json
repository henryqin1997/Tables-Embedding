Executives hired beginning in 2006 are also subject to a 50% ownership requirement after three years and if that is not met, the executive is subject to the same three consequences described above until the 50% ownership requirement is met. Brian Short is the only executive officer hired since 2006., 332375=Under our cash incentive compensation program, we establish a payout scale for each financial measure above and below the target. Each scale sets a threshold level of performance (below which no cash incentive compensation would be earned) and a maximum level of performance (above which no additional incentive compensation could be earned). In recent years, the scales have been designed so that there is a significant fall-off in compensation for performance which is below target and a significant ramp-up in compensation for performance which exceeds the target. For 2009, the payout scales required a threshold achievement of 90% of target DM$ and 80% of target PTP, for which a 50% payout would have been made. If performance reached the maximum level (more than 110% of target DM$ and more than 115% of target PTP), executives could earn a maximum 200% of their target payout. However, in order to earn more than the target payout for DM$, the company\u0092s PTP target must have been met or exceeded. This ensures that significant growth in DM$ is not achieved without maintaining significant levels of profits, which requires management to sustain effective controls on overhead expenses., 261941=KPMG was not retained to provide any non-audit or non-audit-related services to CDI in 2009, though CDI did pay KPMG a $1,333 license fee to use certain UK payroll tax software. Under CDI\u0092s pre-approval policy, management may submit to the Audit Committee for approval a detailed list of non-audit and non-audit-related services that it recommends the Committee engage the independent registered public accounting firm to provide for the year. Management and the independent registered public accounting firm must each confirm to the Committee that each non-audit and non-audit-related service on the list is permissible under all applicable legal requirements. In addition to the list of anticipated non-audit and non-audit-related services, a budget estimating non-audit and non-audit-related service spending for the fiscal year would be provided. The Committee must approve both the list of permissible non-audit and non-audit-related services and the budget for such services. The Committee must be informed routinely as to the non-audit and non-audit-related services actually provided by the independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to this pre-approval process., 98321=The Board has adopted a Code of Conduct that sets forth the principles, policies and obligations that must be adhered to by CDI and its directors, officers and employees (including CDI\u0092s principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer). The Code of Conduct is designed to foster a culture within CDI of honesty and accountability by requiring all directors, officers and employees to conduct themselves in accordance with all applicable legal requirements and ethical standards. Associated with the Code of Conduct are various conduct policies focusing on specific topics, such as our Insider Trading Policy and our Conflicts of Interest and Corporate Opportunities Policy. Copies of the Code of Conduct and the associated conduct policies can be found on our website at www.cdicorp.com (in the Investor Relations section) and will be provided in print to any shareholder who delivers a written request to Investor Relations, CDI Corp., 1717 Arch Street, 35th Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19103-2768., 490303=2009, 343767=The actual DM$ achieved by CDI for 2009 was $176.6 million, which represented 83.8% of the target level of $211.1 million. The actual PTP was a loss of $19.4 million, as compared to the target level of $25.7 million. This resulted in no payout to the NEOs in connection with the portion of cash incentive compensation based on financial measures., 112407=The Executive Committee exercises all the powers of the Board, subject to certain limitations, when the Board is not in session and is unable to meet or it is impractical for the Board to meet. This committee did not hold any meetings during 2009., 833478=Dated: April\u00a016, 2010, 58337=The purpose of this Proxy Statement is to provide information regarding matters to be voted on at the 2010 Annual Meeting of Shareholders of CDI Corp. Also, this Proxy Statement contains certain information that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) require CDI to provide annually to shareholders. This Proxy Statement is the document used by CDI\u0092s Board of Directors (the \u0093Board\u0094) to solicit proxies to be used at the 2010 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Proxies are solicited to give shareholders an opportunity to vote on the matters to be presented at the Annual Meeting, even if they cannot attend the meeting. The Board has designated Joseph R. Seiders and Craig H. Lewis (who are sometimes referred to in this Proxy Statement as the \u0093named proxies\u0094) to vote the shares represented by proxies at the Annual Meeting in the manner indicated by the proxies., 61243=You are entitled to vote if you were a shareholder of record of common stock, par value $.10 per share, of CDI (which is referred to throughout this Proxy Statement as \u0093CDI stock\u0094) as of the close of business on March\u00a012, 2010 (the record date). Your shares can be voted at the meeting only if you are present or have submitted a valid proxy. An alphabetical list of CDI\u0092s registered shareholders, showing the name, address and number of shares held by each shareholder as of the record date, will be available for inspection at the Annual Meeting and at our principal office (1717 Arch Street, 35th Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19103-2768) for at least five days prior to the Annual Meeting., 753331=Shortly after Cecilia Venglarik\u0092s executive role ended in September 2009, she and the company entered into an agreement which provided for the following: (a)\u00a0she would remain with CDI for six months (until March 2010) to assist in the transition of her responsibilities, for which she would be paid at a rate equal to 50% of her previous salary, to reflect the expectation regarding the portion of her time she would be available to the company during that period; (b)\u00a0after she left CDI in March 2010, she would receive salary continuation for up to one year as well as the other benefits under CDI\u0092s Executive Severance Program, in return for her release of the company from claims and her non-competition and non-solicitation covenants; and (c)\u00a0with respect to the shares of TVDS she received in May 2006 under the Executive Stock Purchase Opportunity Program, the remaining unvested shares (which were scheduled to vest in May 2010 and May 2011) would vest in March 2010., 301768=CDI\u0092s stock price remains substantially below the levels in mid-2008, prior to the market downturn. As a result, most of the SARs and stock options held by our executives are underwater (meaning the exercise prices exceed the market price of CDI stock) and the value of the executives\u0092 common stock, TVDS, PCDS and SPP units has declined. These consequences demonstrate that CDI\u0092s executive compensation program is fundamentally a pay-for-performance system and that, when the company\u0092s shareholders experience a significant decline in our stock price, the company\u0092s executives also experience a significant decline in the value of their compensation., 82599=Upon the recommendation of the Governance and Nominating Committee, the Board has nominated seven directors for election at CDI\u0092s 2010 Annual Meeting, to hold office until next year\u0092s Annual Meeting. Each of the nominees is currently a member of the Board. The named proxies intend to vote FOR the seven nominees below, except as to shares for which authority to do so is withheld. The Board is not aware of any reason why any nominee will be unable to stand for election as a director or serve if elected. However, if any such nominee should become unavailable, the Board may nominate, and the named proxies may vote for, a substitute nominee., 361483=(until September 2009), 327245=Under CDI\u0092s cash incentive compensation program, the Committee can increase or decrease the amounts to be paid to executives (except that no increase will be made in the case of a NEO for whom CDI expects the deductibility limitations of Section\u00a0162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code to apply in a given year). The Committee believes that this discretion is important in order to (a)\u00a0take into account unexpected events that may occur after the incentive compensation criteria are set which could otherwise result in payouts that are too high or too low under the circumstances, (b)\u00a0recognize unique or special accomplishments by executives during a given year, (c)\u00a0take into consideration market changes in executive compensation, (d)\u00a0discourage executives from taking unnecessary or excessive risks to achieve performance goals, and (e)\u00a0otherwise carry out the broad objectives of the compensation program. As explained below, in 2009 the Committee used this discretion to reduce the incentive compensation payouts to the executives in connection with their individual objectives., 274490=Joseph R. Seiders , age 61, is Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Chief Compliance Officer of CDI. He has been the Company\u0092s Senior Vice President since 1987, the Chief Compliance Officer since October 2005 and the Chief Legal Officer since March 2009. He was the General Counsel of the Company from 1978 until March 2009., 130345=There were no related party transactions reviewed by the Governance and Nominating Committee in 2009., 863324=THIS PROXY WHEN PROPERLY EXECUTED WILL BE VOTED IN THE MANNER DIRECTED HEREIN BY THE SHAREHOLDER. IF NO DIRECTION IS MADE, THIS PROXY WILL BE VOTED FOR ELECTION TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF ALL SEVEN NOMINEES LISTED IN PROPOSAL ONE ON THE REVERSE SIDE HEREOF AND FOR PROPOSAL TWO TO RATIFY THE APPOINTMENT OF KPMG LLP AS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2010. WITH RESPECT TO ANY OTHER MATTERS OF BUSINESS PROPERLY BEFORE THE MEETING, THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS PROXY WILL BE VOTED AS THE NAMED PROXIES SHALL DECIDE., 456436=Brian D. Short, Senior Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel (beginning in March 2009), 307149=because (a)\u00a0CDI has been roughly in the middle of this size range (with annual revenue between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion from 2006 to 2008, dropping to approximately $900 million in 2009) and (b)\u00a0the nature of the positions held by our NEOs (CEO, CFO, chief administrative officer, head of HR, general counsel and chief legal officer) means that CDI would likely compete with organizations of a similar size in attracting and retaining talented executives in those roles. The 2007 HayGroup study of Mr.\u00a0Kerschner\u0092s compensation was also based on a comparison to the compensation received by the CFOs of hundreds of organizations in CDI\u0092s size range from HayGroup\u0092s database., 275531=This Proxy Statement contains extensive information regarding the 2009 compensation earned by Roger Ballou, Mark Kerschner, Brian Short, Joseph Seiders and Cecilia Venglarik, who are sometimes referred to in this Proxy Statement as the \u0093Named Executive Officers\u0094 or \u0093NEOs\u0094 or \u0093executives\u0094., 588540=The following table provides information on the holdings by the NEOs as of December\u00a031, 2009 of unexercised stock options and SARs (Option Awards) and of unvested TVDS, PCDS and SPP units (Stock Awards). Each equity award is shown separately for each NEO., 94668=Corporate governance encompasses the internal policies and practices by which the CDI Board of Directors operates. The Board believes that effective and consistent corporate governance is an essential part of the company conducting itself in a responsible, legal and ethical manner. In that regard, the Board has adopted Corporate Governance Principles to provide a framework for the governance of CDI. The Corporate Governance Principles address issues such as the Board\u0092s role and responsibilities, the size and composition of the Board, meeting procedures, and committee structure. CDI\u0092s Corporate Governance Principles are posted on our website at www.cdicorp.com (in the Investor Relations section) and will be provided in print to any shareholder who delivers a written request to Investor Relations, CDI Corp., 1717 Arch Street, 35th Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19103-2768., 273892=Brian D. Short , age 37, is Senior Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel of CDI. He has been the company\u0092s Senior Vice President and General Counsel since March 2009 and the Chief Administrative Officer since September 2009. He was a partner in the law firm of Dechert LLP from January 2006 to March 2009. Previously, he was an associate at that law firm., 675813=Notes to the Outstanding Equity Awards at 2009 Fiscal Year-End Table:, 694305=The following table provides information regarding (a)\u00a0all exercises of stock options and SARs by the NEOs in 2009 and (b)\u00a0the vesting of TVDS, PCDS, restricted stock and SPP units in 2009 on an aggregate basis for each of the NEOs. None of the NEOs exercised any stock options or SARs during 2009., 436071=During the six years prior to 2009, no executive\u0092s non-exempt compensation exceeded the Section\u00a0162(m) $1 million limit. However, in 2009, the combination of Mr.\u00a0Ballou\u0092s base salary and TVDS award pushed his non-exempt compensation slightly above the $1 million threshold for deductibility. A similar result is expected in 2010., 56125=This Proxy Statement and the accompanying proxy card are being mailed to the shareholders of CDI Corp. (which is referred to in this Proxy Statement as \u0093CDI\u0094 or \u0093the company\u0094) beginning on or about April\u00a016, 2010., 422552=Equity awards to executives are generally made once a year. Committee policy provides that the Committee will meet to approve the annual awards to the NEOs on the third business day following the issuance of the company\u0092s earnings release for the previous year. The exercise price of SARs and the per share value of TVDS and PCDS awards equals the closing market price of CDI stock on the award date. We schedule the grants of our annual equity awards to take place shortly after the release of our annual earnings so that this information is reflected in CDI\u0092s stock price at the time of the awards. In March 2009, the grants were delayed until the third business day following the filing of CDI\u0092s Form 10-K for 2008, because the company was in a blackout period for trading until that time. The exercise price of SARs and the per share value of the TVDS and PCDS awards in March 2009 equaled the closing market price of CDI on the grant date, consistent with the Committee\u0092s policy., 84746=Mr.\u00a0Ballou, age 59, has been the President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of CDI since October 2001. He has also been a director of CDI since 2001. He has served as a director of Alliance Data Systems Corporation since 2001 and as a director of Fox Chase Bancorp, Inc. since 2005., 112863=The Finance Committee oversees the financial affairs and policies of CDI, including review of the company\u0092s annual operating and capital plans, major acquisitions and dispositions, and borrowing arrangements. This committee held three meetings during 2009., 755737=The following tables set forth the benefits that each NEO would receive if his or her termination or separation from employment or a change in control of CDI had occurred on December\u00a031, 2009. For Ms.\u00a0Venglarik, the table sets forth the benefits that she received as of March 2010 pursuant to the separation agreement she and the company signed in October 2009, but assuming that the termination date had been December\u00a031, 2009 rather than in March 2010., 102948=The Board of Directors of CDI held seven meetings during 2009. Each of the current directors attended more than 95% of the total number of meetings held during 2009 by the Board and the committees of the Board on which he served during the year., 847561=To ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP as CDI Corp.\u0092s independent registered public accounting firm for 2010., 387123=The CEO has not been granted SARs, though he holds stock options which were granted under his previous employment agreement. In formulating the CEO\u0092s compensation package in his 2008 employment agreement, the Committee decided not to use SARs due to the short time period between the effective date of the agreement and the date of Mr.\u00a0Ballou\u0092s possible retirement in March 2011 at the end of the agreement term., 313924=HayGroup examined the compensation paid to the CEO and to the highest paid executive of each of those peer group companies, as set forth in their proxy statements. The February 2006 report also examined the compensation paid to the CEOs of over 350 companies in the $500 million to $2 billion size range in various industries and sectors (from HayGroup\u0092s database). The results from HayGroup\u0092s database largely confirmed the peer group data. In using the information from HayGroup\u0092s February 2006 report when it determined Mr.\u00a0Ballou\u0092s compensation arrangements in his current employment agreement, the Committee increased the median competitive CEO numbers in the report to account for inflation during the period from the year in which the compensation analyzed in the report was paid and the years covered by Mr.\u00a0Ballou\u0092s new employment agreement. Mr.\u00a0Ballou\u0092s salary was increased by 9% (from a rate of $687,500 per year to a rate of $750,000 per year) as of January\u00a01, 2008 because the Committee believed, based on the HayGroup report, that his salary had fallen below the market median level for CEOs at comparable companies., 4125=Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 273301=Mark A. Kerschner , age 56, has been the Executive Vice President of CDI since September 2005 and the company\u0092s Chief Financial Officer since November 2005. Previously, he was (from 2004 to 2005) the Vice President and Assistant Controller of Schering-Plough Corporation (a global company which developed, manufactured and marketed prescription and consumer health products)., 588245=Outstanding Equity Awards at 2009 Fiscal Year-End Table, 250027=KPMG LLP served as CDI\u0092s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal years ended December\u00a031, 2009 and December\u00a031, 2008. KPMG\u0092s fees for services rendered to CDI for the past two fiscal years are set forth in the table below. The Audit Committee pre-approved all of these services., 300846=CDI faced difficult economic conditions in 2009. The financial targets for our non-equity incentive compensation program and our PCDS program were drawn from our 2009 financial plan. That plan, which was developed in late 2008, was based on assumptions regarding the U.S. and global economy and the timing and strength of a business recovery which proved to be incorrect. Consequently, CDI\u0092s 2009 financial results were substantially below the targeted levels, which in turn resulted in no PCDS being earned by the executives in 2009 and only a small fraction of the targeted non-equity incentive compensation being awarded (all of which related to the achievement of individual objectives rather than company financial objectives)., 19727=1717 Arch Street, 35th Floor, 356159=Key individual objectives for our CEO in 2009 were for CDI to meet its financial plan, to ensure progress on the company\u0092s strategic plan, to lower the company\u0092s indirect cost base and improve productivity, and to lead a talent management and succession planning process with involvement by the Board. These objectives were designed to, 267855=Management completed the documentation, testing and evaluation of CDI\u0092s system of internal control over financial reporting as of December\u00a031, 2009. The Audit Committee was kept apprised of the progress of the evaluation over the course of the year and provided oversight during that process. In connection with this oversight, the Committee received periodic updates provided by management, KPMG and the internal auditors, and the Committee discussed issues raised by those updates as they arose. At the conclusion of the process, management provided the Committee with a report which concluded that the company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December\u00a031, 2009, and the Committee reviewed and discussed that report., 501504=The personal benefits and perquisites to Mr.\u00a0Ballou in 2009 consisted of the use of a parking space in the office building where CDI\u0092s executive offices are located (at a cost of $4,980), travel and meal expenses for his spouse when accompanying him on certain business trips (costs totaling $4,260), a club membership (at a cost of $3,800), attendance by family and friends at charity events paid for by CDI (total value of $2,200), a cell phone and Blackberry allowance, and the use of a company computer in his home. Personal benefits and perquisites are valued on the basis of the aggregate incremental cost to the company or, in the case of tickets to charity events, based on information from the charities., 372126=We believe that ownership of CDI stock by our executives creates an important link between the financial interests of those executives and the interests of our other shareholders. Accordingly, we regard the stock-based elements of the executive compensation program as essential to the program\u0092s effectiveness. During the first quarter of each year, we grant equity awards to our executives under the 2004 CDI Corp. Omnibus Stock Plan (the \u0093Omnibus Plan\u0094). These awards generally consist of a combination of the following: stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs), Time-Vested Deferred Stock (TVDS) and Performance-Contingent Deferred Stock (PCDS)., 401149=Since CDI\u0092s PTP in 2009 was a loss of $19.4 million, which is below the threshold, Mr.\u00a0Ballou did not earn any shares of PCDS for 2009., 97378=In February 2010, the Board conducted this review and determined that all of the directors of CDI are independent (and satisfy the independence requirements set forth in the listing standards of the NYSE) except for Roger Ballou and Barton Winokur. Mr.\u00a0Ballou, the company\u0092s CEO, is the only director who is a CDI employee. Mr.\u00a0Winokur is the Chairman, CEO and a partner of Dechert LLP, a law firm that provides legal services to CDI (including services as counsel to the Audit Committee). Dechert\u0092s billings to CDI for services rendered in 2009 were approximately $223,000., 433064=To further reduce CDI\u0092s compensation-related risks, in 2009 the Committee adopted a new policy under which the company can cancel and recoup (or \u0093claw back\u0094) from any employee in the CDI organization any incentive compensation or equity awards that were based on incorrect information, whether the error in the information occurred as a result of oversight, negligence or intentional misconduct (including fraud). The Committee will have the discretion to treat employees who received an award based on incorrect information differently depending on an employee\u0092s degree of involvement in causing the error, an employee\u0092s assistance in discovering and/or correcting the error, and any other facts that the Committee determines to be relevant., 319069=The base salaries of the NEOs for 2009 are set forth in the Summary Compensation Table on page 42. In March 2009, in an effort to reduce costs in the face of a difficult economic environment, CDI reduced the base salaries of all executives (along with all staff employees) by 2.5%. Mr.\u00a0Short\u0092s salary when he started at CDI was at an annual rate of $295,000, which was the result of negotiations between Mr.\u00a0Short and the Company and which the Company determined to be at roughly the market median level paid to General Counsel at comparable companies as indicated in the HayGroup 2008 study. In recognition of the additional responsibilities given to Mr.\u00a0Short in September 2009 upon assuming the duties of the former Senior Vice President of Human Resources, Mr.\u00a0Short\u0092s salary was increased to an annual rate of $315,000 at that time. In February 2010, Mr.\u00a0Short\u0092s salary was increased to an annual rate of $335,000 based on internal pay equity considerations, after a review of his salary and responsibilities compared with other executives and members of CDI\u0092s senior management team. Except for these salary increases for Mr.\u00a0Short, none of the NEOs has received a salary increase since 2008. Holding the line on fixed compensation is part of a wider program of cost-containment measures at CDI in response to a downturn in business. We believe that these cost-cutting measures will contribute to the long-term financial strength of CDI., 744851=2004 Buyback Program for Unused Time-Off, 272857=Roger H. Ballou , age 59, has been the President and Chief Executive Officer of CDI since October 2001 and has served as a director of CDI since that time. See page 5 for additional biographical information regarding Mr. Ballou., 392965=more than 100% of their target PCDS award, with the maximum number of shares which could be earned for 2009 equal to 200% of the target amount. However, awards in excess of 100% could only be earned if CDI exceeded its net income goal in the 2009 financial plan, requiring that superior levels of DM$ be matched by superior levels of bottom line earnings. The Committee believes that this incentive to potentially earn more than 100% of their PCDS award encourages executives to produce exceptional financial performance and thereby further increase shareholder value. For 2009, the maximum award would be earned if the company\u0092s DM$ hit or exceeded $226.1 million. For 2009, the actual DM$ achieved by CDI was $176.6 million and, accordingly, the executives did not earn any of their PCDS awards., 483177=For additional information regarding the valuation assumptions relating to CDI\u0092s Option Awards, see Note 8 to the company\u0092s financial statements in the Form 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2009. The amounts in this column reflect the grant date fair value for these awards under accounting rules and do not correspond to the actual value that will be realized by the executives. The 2008 and 2007 Option Awards values were recalculated from amounts shown in prior CDI proxy statements to reflect their grant date fair values, as required by SEC rules effective for 2010. See the CD&A for more information about CDI\u0092s stock options and SARs., 733858=Under the Executive Severance Program, executives are entitled to receive continuing payments of bi-weekly amounts equal to the base salary they were receiving before their termination for up to twelve months following their termination by CDI without cause. (For this purpose, the 2.5% salary reductions instituted in 2009 as a cost-cutting measure during the economic downturn are not considered.) The company also pays up to $15,000 in outplacement services. In addition, each executive (unless he or she resigns or is terminated for cause) has up to two months following termination of employment in which to exercise any stock options or SARs that vested prior to termination of employment. During the twelve-month severance period, (a)\u00a0if the executive elects to continue paying premiums under CDI\u0092s group medical, dental and vision insurance (referred to collectively as \u0093health insurance\u0094) plan pursuant to the plan\u0092s continuation coverage provisions, CDI would continue to pay the same portion of the executive\u0092s health insurance premiums as it was previously paying, and (b)\u00a0CDI would continue to provide basic life insurance coverage. The severance payments, the company contributions towards health insurance and the life insurance coverage all cease when the departed executive secures another job (or after twelve months, whichever comes first). In return for receiving these severance payments, the executive must agree to (a)\u00a0release the company from claims, and (b)\u00a0not compete with CDI or solicit its employees or customers during the severance period., 41230=Services and Fees of the Independent Registered Public Accounting firm for 2009 and 2008, 462796=Cecilia J. Venglarik, Senior Vice President, Human Resources (until September 2009), 349079=2007, 57500=CDI\u0092s Annual Report and Form 10-K for 2009 can also be found at that site., 388908=The approach that the Committee and Mr.\u00a0Ballou took in negotiating the amount of TVDS and PCDS to be granted to Mr.\u00a0Ballou under his 2008 employment agreement was to establish a Long-Term Incentive (LTI) dollar amount and to divide this LTI amount into awards of TVDS and PCDS. To establish the LTI amount, they examined the HayGroup compensation study described earlier in this CD&A and concluded that for 2008 (the first year of the three-year agreement) the LTI amount should be 150% of Mr.\u00a0Ballou\u0092s salary, or $1,125,000. They then agreed that 25% of this amount, or $281,250, should be TVDS and 75%, or $843,750, should be PCDS. This would provide the retention incentive that comes from the certainty of TVDS and the performance motivation that comes from PCDS. However, the Committee determined that the performance motivation should become more important as the agreement progresses, while the retention motivation should become less important as Mr.\u00a0Ballou\u0092s employment term nears its end. Accordingly, the Committee decided to increase the potential PCDS awards in the second and third years of the agreement (2009 and 2010) while holding the TVDS award constant at $281,250 per year. In the next section of this CD&A, we will describe certain changes that have made to the CEO\u0092s 2008 employment agreement affecting his potential PCDS payouts in 2009 and 2010. The shares of TVDS which Mr.\u00a0Ballou receives have shorter vesting periods than the five years which is typical for other CDI executives, in recognition of the March 2011 expiration date of his employment agreement., 308033=When it negotiated the compensation terms in Mr.\u00a0Ballou\u0092s current employment agreement in late 2007, the Committee looked at the results of a HayGroup study delivered in February 2006 which assessed compensation levels received by CEOs and other executives at comparable companies. The 2006 report examined the proxy statements of the nineteen peer group companies that are listed below. HayGroup used sixteen of the seventeen companies that constituted CDI\u0092s peer group index in the stock performance graph which appeared in CDI\u0092s 2005 proxy statement. Those peer group companies represent a mix of companies of varying sizes that mirror the businesses in which CDI engages. HayGroup eliminated one company (Adecco, S.A.) from CDI\u0092s proxy statement peer group because that company was based overseas and was not viewed as a good comparison for executive compensation purposes. HayGroup added three companies for its proxy statement compensation analysis \u0096 Ceridian Corporation, Covance Inc. and TeleTech Holdings, Inc. Below is the list of peer group companies that HayGroup analyzed in its February 2006 report., 111107=The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by (a)\u00a0reviewing the financial reports and other financial information provided by CDI to shareholders, the SEC and others, (b)\u00a0monitoring the company\u0092s financial reporting processes and internal control systems, (c)\u00a0retaining the company\u0092s independent registered public accounting firm (subject to shareholder ratification), (d)\u00a0overseeing the company\u0092s independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors, and (e)\u00a0monitoring CDI\u0092s compliance with ethics policies and with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. This committee held sixteen meetings during 2009., 24071=Only shareholders of record on March\u00a012, 2010 are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. The vote of each shareholder is important to us. If you do not expect to attend the meeting in person and desire to have your shares represented and voted at the meeting, please fill in, sign and promptly return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying envelope. No postage is necessary if mailed in the United States. Most shareholders can also vote their shares over the Internet or by telephone. See the instructions on your proxy card or in the attached proxy statement. If you do attend the meeting, you may revoke your proxy and vote in person., 350268=2006, 150557=No consulting fees were paid in 2009 to any of CDI\u0092s directors., 830765=CDI\u0092s Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended December\u00a031, 2009 is being mailed to all shareholders together with this Proxy Statement. That report should not be regarded as proxy solicitation material or as a part of this Proxy Statement., 37756=Director Compensation Table for 2009, 352746=Under the terms of Mr.\u00a0Ballou\u0092s employment agreement, his cash incentive compensation is capped at 120% of his salary. This cap came into play in 2007. This cap originated in Mr.\u00a0Ballou\u0092s 2001 employment agreement as the Committee intended to put reasonable limits on CEO cash compensation., 421673=The TVDS is forfeited if the executive resigns or is terminated for cause prior to vesting. Executives at higher levels and with greater impact on the company\u0092s financial performance are eligible to purchase more shares under this program. When Mr.\u00a0Short joined CDI in March 2009, he was given the opportunity to participate in this program and he purchased shares under the program., 328831=Under the 2009 cash incentive compensation program, 75% of each executive\u0092s target incentive was based on the company\u0092s achievement of its financial targets. The Committee chose direct margin dollars (DM$) and pre-tax profits (PTP) as the financial measures for the 2009 program, with the two measures given approximately equal weight. DM$ was selected to encourage management to maintain and grow higher-margin business during the economic downturn, when overall revenue growth was expected to be difficult to achieve. PTP was selected to make sure that management focused on cost containment during the recession and because we believe PTP has a more direct impact on shareholder value., 190491=December\u00a031, 2009, 401480=In February 2010, the Committee established the terms of the executives\u0092 PCDS opportunity for 2010. The metric used for the CEO was changed to EPS, which the Committee believes will have a more direct impact on shareholder, 745091=In 2004, CDI changed its policy regarding the ability of employees to carry over unused paid time-off from year to year. After 2004, the company generally prohibited such carry-overs. In transitioning to the new policy, the company offered all employees who had accumulated more than 40 unused paid time-off days the option to (a)\u00a0use their remaining time-off days before the end of 2004, (b)\u00a0defer payment for the unused days until termination of their employment (with the payment based on their salary in effect as of September\u00a030, 2004), or (c)\u00a0receive, shortly after the end of 2004, cash equal to 50% of the value of the unused days. Of the NEOs, Cecilia Venglarik and Joseph Seiders selected option (b), Roger Ballou selected option (c), and Messrs. Kerschner and Short were not employed by CDI in 2004 and so were not participants in this buyback program., 203731=2929 Arch Street, 316350=Based on the benchmarking studies done by HayGroup, the Committee believes that the target compensation for CDI\u0092s executives is at approximately the median level for similar executives at comparably-sized organizations. The Committee recognizes, however, that when CDI\u0092s performance falls below targeted levels of performance (which has been the case in recent years, with the exception of 2007), the actual compensation received by CDI\u0092s executives may be significantly below the market median. This is a natural consequence of our pay-for-performance philosophy. The Committee plans to engage an independent outside compensation consulting firm in 2010 to perform a new executive compensation study., 391782=For the 2009 awards of PCDS to our NEOs other than the CEO, the threshold for earning any shares was DM$ of $211.1 million, corresponding to the target DM$ in CDI\u0092s financial plan, as approved by the Finance Committee and the Board shortly before the beginning of the year. The PCDS program encourages executives to achieve above-target growth and only pays out if CDI performs above target levels. For 2009, the target number of PCDS shares would be earned if DM$ was in the range of $221.1 \u0096 $222.0 million. Executives are given the opportunity to earn, 151783=Director Compensation Table for 2009, 397051=The following table shows the dollar amounts of the PCDS awards which the CEO could have earned at various levels of performance by CDI in 2009., 740086=With respect to Mr.\u00a0Ballou\u0092s annual non-equity incentive compensation, his employment agreement requires that he be employed by CDI when the payment is made except (a)\u00a0if his employment was terminated by the company without cause or by Mr.\u00a0Ballou for Good Reason or (b)\u00a0the termination is the result of his retirement at the end of his employment term on March\u00a031, 2011., 739537=The agreement also provides that if Mr.\u00a0Ballou\u0092s employment with CDI ends as a result of the expiration of his employment term on March\u00a031, 2011, his departure will be considered a retirement. As such, Mr.\u00a0Ballou will be eligible for accelerated vesting of his deferral units (i.e., their conversion into shares of common stock) under the SPP., 54003=Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table for 2009, 150811=Under a 1978 supplemental pension agreement with Walter Garrison, CDI\u0092s retired President and CEO, the company pays him a pension of $35,000 per year for fifteen years following his retirement (which began in 1997). If Mr.\u00a0Garrison dies prior to receiving all such payments, his beneficiaries will receive the remaining payments in a lump sum., 198457=The required ownership level will be increased to $400,000 effective in 2011 for current members of the Board. When this new requirement goes into effect, any director who does not own $400,000 of CDI stock by and after the director\u0092s fourth year on the Board (or by 2011 in the case of the current directors) would then have up to $30,000 of the director\u0092s retainer fee payable in subsequent years automatically deferred into the SPP, with no company match, until the required ownership level is met., 80564=If you did not receive your own copy of this Proxy Statement or our annual report for 2009, CDI will send a copy to you if you mail a written request to Investor Relations, CDI Corp., 1717 Arch Street, 35th Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19103-2768 or call (215)\u00a0569-2200. This Proxy Statement is available online at http://investor.shareholder.com/cdi/2010proxy.cfm . The current and past CDI proxy statements and annual reports can also be found at www.cdicorp.com , in the Investor Relations section., 394563=As discussed earlier, the CEO\u0092s opportunity to earn shares of PCDS based on the company\u0092s 2009 financial performance is governed by his employment agreement. In determining the financial performance which CDI needed to achieve in the three years of his current employment agreement, the Committee used the PTP targets in the company\u0092s long-range strategic plan at the time the employment agreement was being negotiated. However, the agreement noted that economic conditions could change dramatically from what was in the long-range strategic plan and therefore provided that PCDS targets could be modified in a given year if approved by the Finance Committee and the Compensation Committee. Pursuant to that provision, the PTP target for the CEO\u0092s 2009 PCDS program was lowered to $25.7 million, coinciding with the company\u0092s PTP target in the 2009 financial plan. The levels of PTP for the threshold and maximum PCDS payouts were modified to maintain the original ratios to the target levels in the employment agreement. Since achievement of the PTP levels in the long-range strategic plan (developed prior to the CEO\u0092s 2008 employment agreement) are no longer realistic as a result of the intervening economic recession, the Committee believed that an adjustment to the 2009 targets was necessary in order for the PCDS to provide a continuing incentive for the CEO., 834833=Internet and telephone voting are available through 11:59 PM Eastern Time the day prior to the annual meeting date., 353237=For 2010, the Committee has decided to keep DM$ as a performance goal but to replace PTP with earnings per share (EPS) and to give greater weight to the EPS component of the cash incentive program (representing 52% of the total cash incentive opportunity). The Committee concluded that EPS growth would have the most direct impact on increasing shareholder value, particularly in a recovering economy. The Committee also lowered the threshold percentage of target achievement that would be necessary to earn any incentive compensation in 2010, but to keep the program in balance, it also lowered the maximum payout as a percentage of the target payout. The Committee concluded that in recent years the performance levels needed to earn any cash incentive compensation had been too close to the target levels of performance (in the 90% range), which reduced the incentive value of the program during a year in which it becomes increasingly clear that targets are unlikely to be attained. The somewhat lower threshold is also in recognition of the significant uncertainty regarding the timing and pace of the economic recovery in 2010, which makes the setting of targets particularly challenging. Based on our review of proxy statements of various peer and other companies and published studies by compensation consultants, we confirmed our belief that the adjustment in the payout scales for 2010 makes our cash incentive compensation more competitive and more in line with industry practice., 151350=The following table shows the 2009 compensation for our non-employee directors, including Constantine Papadakis, who served on the Board until his death in April 2009., 502928=Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table for 2009, 716520=The following table provides information regarding the contributions, earnings, distributions and year-end balances of the NEOs under CDI\u0092s Deferred Compensation Plan for 2009. Brian Short did not participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan for 2009., 134510=1717 Arch Street, 35th Floor, 302609=The company took a number of steps in 2009 in response to the difficult economic conditions that confronted the company. The company reduced the salaries of all staff employees (including the executives) by 2.5% beginning in March, suspended the company\u0092s matching contributions to CDI\u0092s 401(k) plan, reduced the CEO\u0092s opportunity to earn PCDS in 2009 and reset the performance target to earn those shares to coincide with CDI\u0092s financial plan. The company also adjusted the type of financial metrics used in the non-equity incentive compensation program and in the PCDS program to encourage direct margin and profit growth in a very challenging business environment., 56809=FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS\u0092 MEETING TO BE HELD ON MAY 18, 2010, 402331=value than PTP. The metric used for the other NEOs in 2010 will remain DM$. The 2010 performance targets for the CEO and the other NEOs were established based on the company\u0092s 2010 financial plan. As was done in 2009, lower 2010 performance targets for the CEO were balanced by lower potential PCDS payouts for him, so that both the targets and the payouts had been reduced from the levels in his 2008 employment agreement in roughly the same proportions. While the payout scale for the CEO remains in the same proportion as set forth in his employment agreement, the 2010 payout scale for the other NEOs was adjusted downward, to provide both a lower threshold to earn any PCDS and a lower maximum PCDS payout. The Committee concluded that in recent years the performance levels needed to earn any PCDS had been too close to the target levels of performance, which reduced the incentive value of the program during a year when it became increasingly clear that targets were unlikely to be attained. The somewhat lower threshold also reflects the significant uncertainty regarding the timing and pace of the economic recovery, which makes the setting of targets particularly challenging at this time. The Committee believes that this adjustment in the PCDS payout scales for 2010 will make our equity incentive compensation program more competitive and more in line with industry practice., 390977=PCDS provides incentive compensation that can be earned only if an objective financial performance measure, or threshold, is met by CDI in a given year. The metrics for 2009 were PTP for the CEO and DM$ for the other NEOs. DM$ was used for most of the NEOs and other members of the senior management group to promote the development of higher-margin business in a difficult economic year when earnings were likely to be depressed. PTP was used for the CEO pursuant to his employment agreement, which the Committee believed was appropriate since the CEO is the executive most accountable for the company\u0092s earnings., 347130=2009, 497583=2007, 751966=If the termination occurs at any time due to the participant\u0092s retirement or disability or for any reason other than cause or the participant\u0092s resignation, then the unvested SPP units (including any company match units) will immediately vest and the participant will receive a number of shares of CDI stock equal to the number of SPP units. Under his 2008 employment agreement, if Roger Ballou remains employed by CDI through the end of his employment term on March\u00a031, 2011 and does not become employed by another company for one year following that date, he will be deemed to have retired as of that date., 737456=remaining employment term or one year. Also, in the event of (a)\u00a0or (b)\u00a0described above in this paragraph or upon Mr.\u00a0Ballou\u0092s retirement at the end of his employment term, if he elects to continue paying premiums under CDI\u0092s group medical insurance plans, the company would continue to pay the same portion of his medical insurance premiums as it was previously paying, until Mr.\u00a0Ballou reaches age 65 or until he accepts employment with another company, whichever comes first. On March\u00a031, 2011, the scheduled expiration date of\u00a0Mr. Ballou\u0092s current employment term, he will be 59 years old., 348274=2008, 68680=The proxy card is in a form that permits you to withhold authority to vote for the election of any or all of the seven nominated directors and to separately approve or disapprove of the appointment of KPMG LLP as CDI\u0092s independent registered public accounting firm for 2010. If you sign and return the proxy card, your shares will be voted for the election of all of the seven nominated directors unless you indicate that authority to do so is withheld, and in favor of the appointment of KPMG LLP as CDI\u0092s independent registered public accounting firm unless you specify a different vote., 279567=The table below provides a summary of the components of CDI\u0092s executive compensation program for 2009, including the objectives of each component, and illustrates that the components are generally tied (directly or indirectly) to either company or individual performance, in ways that we believe serve to enhance shareholder value. In designing our executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee (which is referred to simply as the Committee in this CD&A) seeks to balance (a)\u00a0cash and non-cash compensation, (b)\u00a0compensation that is fixed and compensation that is contingent on performance, and (c)\u00a0for contingent compensation, payouts that are based on the company\u0092s short-term performance and payouts based on long-term performance. More information and analysis regarding each of these components is contained below in this CD&A., 410454=Pursuant to this severance policy, Ms.\u00a0Venglarik will receive up to one year of payments in an amount equal to her base salary. These payments began in March 2010, when her employment with CDI ended. Between September 2009, when her executive responsibilities ended, and March 2010, Ms.\u00a0Venglarik was paid at a rate equal to 50% of her previous base salary, to reflect the expectation that the time she would be available to assist in the transition of her responsibilities would be approximately 50% of a full-time position. As required under our severance policy, Ms.\u00a0Venglarik has signed a release and waiver of claims against CDI and agreed not to compete with CDI or solicit its customers or employees during the severance period., 304869=The most recent study of executive compensation was done by HayGroup in 2008 and was delivered to the Committee in October of that year. In that study, HayGroup evaluated median compensation for two of the NEOs (Mr. Seiders and Ms.\u00a0Venglarik) and for most of the other members of CDI\u0092s senior management group. The compensation for the CEO and the CFO was not addressed in the 2008 study because HayGroup had evaluated CFO compensation in a 2007 report and because earlier HayGroup data had been reviewed by the Committee in 2007 when it negotiated the compensation terms in the CEO\u0092s most recent employment agreement (which became effective on January\u00a01, 2008)., 862063=Each shareholder signing this Proxy hereby appoints Joseph R. Seiders and Craig H. Lewis, and each of them acting individually, each with the power to appoint his substitute, as proxies and hereby authorizes them to represent and to vote, as designated on the reverse side, all the shares of common stock of CDI Corp. held of record by the signer on March\u00a012, 2010, at CDI Corp.\u0092s annual meeting of shareholders to be held on May\u00a018, 2010, or any adjournments or postponements thereof. In the event that any other matter may properly come before the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the named proxies are each authorized to vote upon such matter at their discretion. Each shareholder signing this Proxy acknowledges receipt of the Proxy Statement dated April\u00a016, 2010 and hereby expressly revokes any and all proxies heretofore given or executed by the undersigned with respect to the shares of stock represented by this Proxy and by filing this Proxy with the Secretary of CDI Corp. gives notice of such revocation., 364793=We believe that the 2009 reductions in the incentive compensation payouts to our executives in a year when the company\u0092s financial performance was well below prior year levels are in keeping with CDI\u0092s pay-for-performance philosophy., 331024=Our targets are intended to be realistic and achievable when they are established. We believe that if financial targets are not attainable, the compensation program will lose the motivational effect it was designed to achieve and payouts will lag behind competitive market levels. CDI\u0092s 2009 financial plan and its financial targets were approved by the Board in late 2008. While it became clear fairly early in 2009 that the company was unlikely to reach the plan targets, the Committee decided not to reduce the targets for purposes of the management cash incentive compensation program. The Committee believes that such a step could undermine the integrity of the program, and is similarly not inclined to raise incentive plan targets in a year where it appears that the targets may have become fairly easy to achieve. The Finance Committee and the Board approve the annual financial plan for CDI which they believe is appropriate based on all of the information available to them shortly before the beginning of the year. CDI management is expected to live by the financial targets set forth in the annual plan for purposes of their incentive compensation., 40780=Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for 2010, 416924=During 2009, the Committee modified the SPP so that an executive will not be required to defer a portion of the person\u0092s cash incentive compensation if the executive has already satisfied CDI\u0092s stock ownership requirements. This change, which will be effective for any cash incentive compensation earned for 2010, was made because the Committee concluded that once an executive has achieved the required levels of CDI stock ownership, there was no longer the need to force the executive to be paid in additional equity. The company match will, however, continue to provide an incentive to such executives to continue to voluntarily defer up to 25% of cash incentive compensation into SPP units., 381514=The option equivalent numbers for the NEOs (other than the CEO) in 2009 are listed below. The specific equity awards made to each NEO in 2009 are set forth in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table on page 45. The option equivalent numbers for Mr.\u00a0Kerschner, Mr.\u00a0Seiders and Ms.\u00a0Venglarik are the same as in the previous two years. Mr.\u00a0Short, who joined CDI in March 2009, received equity awards of essentially the same size as Mr.\u00a0Seiders and Ms.\u00a0Venglarik (reflecting the view that his role and responsibilities were equivalent to those other executives at that time), but the numbers were reduced to reflect the portion of the year that Mr.\u00a0Short worked for CDI., 90183=Mr.\u00a0Kozich, age 71, has been a director of CDI since 2003. He was the Managing Partner of Ernst\u00a0& Young LLP\u0092s Philadelphia office from 1991 to 1999, when he retired. He has served as a director of Tasty Baking Company since 2000., 363130=The CEO typically assesses the performance by the other NEOs of their individual objectives and recommends achievement percentages to the Committee, which evaluates these recommendations and either accepts or revises them, and then approves them. The determination of the 2009 incentive compensation to the other NEOs relating to their individual objectives was similar to that for the CEO, as described above. Due mainly to CDI\u0092s disappointing financial performance in 2009, the CEO recommended, and the Committee agreed to, the following payouts with respect to the individual objectives component of the cash incentive program: $10,000 to Mr.\u00a0Kerschner and Mr.\u00a0Seiders, and approximately $18,000 to Mr.\u00a0Short. The higher payout to Mr.\u00a0Short was in recognition of his successful assumption of additional responsibilities after Ms.\u00a0Venglarik departed. No payout was made to Ms.\u00a0Venglarik, reflecting the termination of her executive duties during the year. These payouts represent the following percentages of the executives\u0092 target payouts with respect to their individual objectives: 24% to Mr.\u00a0Kerschner, 30% to Mr.\u00a0Seiders, and 65% to Mr.\u00a0Short. While no precise determination was made regarding the exact percentage of the objectives that the executives had achieved in 2009, the Committee and the CEO believe that the overall performance of these executives against their objectives was well above the payout percentages, 116594=The Compensation Committee is composed entirely of independent, nonemployee directors. The Compensation Committee has sole authority to determine the CEO\u0092s compensation. The Committee also has decision-making authority with respect to the compensation arrangements for other members of CDI\u0092s senior management team within these policy guidelines: (a)\u00a0base pay must not exceed the 75th percentile of market compensation as determined by an independent compensation consultant (although, as described in the CD&A section of this Proxy Statement, the Committee generally targets compensation to be around the 50th percentile); (b)\u00a0the employees\u0092 short-term incentive opportunity must stay within the parameters of the existing non-equity incentive compensation plan; and (c)\u00a0annual equity grants must not exceed the average grants over the previous three years plus twenty percent and must be market competitive as determined by an independent compensation consultant. Any non-CEO compensation arrangement which falls outside of these guidelines must be presented to and reviewed by the Board for approval. No such arrangement was presented to the Board in 2009., 861528=1717 Arch Street, 35th Floor, 323872=Our 2009 cash incentive compensation program was designed to reward executives for achievement of CDI financial objectives and for achievement of individual objectives that were tailored to each executive\u0092s role and responsibilities. The following table shows the relative weights given to the various elements of our cash incentive compensation program for the NEOs in 2009:, 365731=Summary of Cash Incentive Compensation Earned in 2009, 419168=The Committee monitors the progress of the executives in achieving their required stock ownership levels. The Committee most recently looked at this in October 2009. At that time, all of the executive officers had substantially exceeded their stock ownership requirements, except for Mr.\u00a0Short, who had just joined the company earlier in the year and is therefore not yet subject to these requirements., 396121=In the CEO\u0092s 2008 employment agreement, the Committee established the dollar amount of PCDS which Mr.\u00a0Ballou could earn based on competitive market data, as explained earlier. The equity compensation which the CEO can earn if the company performs at or above target is even more heavily weighted towards PCDS than TVDS than is the case for the other NEOs. This is in keeping with the Committee\u0092s view that higher-ranking executives with greater impact on CDI\u0092s financial results should have more of their compensation at risk and dependent on CDI\u0092s performance. To balance the lowering of the CEO\u0092s PCDS performance target in 2009, the potential PCDS payouts that the CEO could earn were also lowered, in roughly the same proportions., 493926=2008, 59597=The Annual Meeting will be held on Tuesday, May\u00a018, 2010 at 10:00 a.m., on the 3rd Floor of the Comcast Center, located at 1701 JFK Boulevard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103., 472270=these awards under accounting rules and do not correspond to the actual value that will be realized by the executives. The 2008 and 2007 Stock Awards values shown in this Summary Compensation Table were recalculated from amounts shown in prior CDI proxy statements to reflect their grant date fair values, as required by SEC rules effective for 2010., 112009=The Compensation Committee reviews and approves CDI\u0092s executive compensation arrangements and programs, as described in more detail on page 9. This committee held nine meetings during 2009., 78585=You do not need to make a reservation to attend the Annual Meeting. However, please note that in order to be admitted to, and vote at, the meeting you will need to demonstrate that you were a CDI shareholder on March\u00a012, 2010., 269582=Based on the reviews and discussions described in this Report, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in CDI\u0092s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2009, for filing with the SEC., 52715=Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table for 2009, 503125=The following table provides information about equity and non-equity awards granted to the NEOs in 2009. The type of award is indicated at the beginning of each row in the table. All awards were made under the Omnibus Plan except for SPP units, which are made under the Stock Purchase Plan., 271867=The Board of Directors of CDI elects the executive officers of the company. Annual elections traditionally take place at the meeting of the Board held on the day of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Below are all of CDI\u0092s executive officers during 2009, along with their business experience over the past five years. Cecilia Venglarik served as an executive officer until September\u00a022, 2009, after which another executive (Brian Short) assumed her responsibilities. For the rest of 2009, Ms.\u00a0Venglarik remained an employee of CDI and was available to assist the company in connection with the change in management responsibilities., 362131=In early 2010, the Committee determined that, in view of the company\u0092s disappointing financial performance in 2009, any cash incentive compensation to the CEO relating to his individual objectives for 2009 would be modest, regardless of the CEO\u0092s level of achievement with respect to those objectives. Accordingly, applying the discretion it has under our cash incentive program, the Committee awarded $37,500 to the CEO. While this amount represents 25% of the target payout relating to his individual objectives (and 6.25% of his total target payout of cash incentive compensation), no precise determination was made regarding the exact percentage of the objectives that the CEO achieved. However, the Committee believes that the CEO\u0092s performance against his 2009 individual objectives was well above 25%., 215991=The following table sets forth, as to each person who is a director, director nominee or executive officer, and as to all directors, director nominees and executive officers of CDI as a group, the number of shares of CDI stock beneficially owned as of March\u00a012, 2010 and the percentage which that number represents of the total outstanding shares of CDI stock beneficially owned as of that date. Under SEC rules, any shares which a person has the right to acquire (such as by exercising an option or SAR) within the sixty-day period after March\u00a012, 2010 are considered to be beneficially owned as of March\u00a012, 2010., 393953=Under our general PCDS program, any shares that are earned vest 50% at the time they are earned (which would typically be determined in February or March of the year after the performance goal was achieved) and 50% one year later. The executive must be employed by the company at the time shares of PCDS vest in order to receive the stock. This vesting feature is designed to add a retention element to the PCDS awards., 86040=Mr.\u00a0Emmi, age 68, has been a director of CDI since 1999. He has been, since April 2002, the Chairman and CEO of IPR International LLC, which provides electronic data backup storage, archiving, business continuity and data center services. He served as a director of Metallurg, Inc. from 2003 to 2007 and as a director of Education Management Corporation from 2004 to 2006., 303756=Our objective is that, when the company achieves its target level of performance, the total cash compensation and the total equity compensation earned by our executives will each approximate the median level (50 th percentile) of such elements at comparable companies. We regard compensation that is within a band of 20% above or below the median level to be approximately at the median level. To determine what comparable companies are paying their executives, the Committee has previously retained HayGroup, an independent outside compensation consulting firm, to do periodic studies. HayGroup reported directly to the Committee and did not work for CDI\u0092s management. HayGroup performed no services for the company in 2009., 694102=Option Exercises and Stock Vested Table for 2009, 267250=The Committee held sixteen meetings during 2009. Committee meetings were designed, among other things, to facilitate and encourage communication among members of the Committee, CDI\u0092s management, KPMG and the internal auditors. The Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements of CDI for the year ended December\u00a031, 2009 with management of the company and with representatives of KPMG., 357456=The following table provides examples of 2009 individual objectives that were established for the other NEOs., 197828=requirements: (1)\u00a0shares of CDI stock owned by the director, the director\u0092s spouse or a trust for the benefit of the director or members of his or her family, (2)\u00a0shares of TVDS, (3)\u00a0SPP units, and (4)\u00a0shares of CDI stock held in the company\u0092s 401(k) plan or an IRA maintained by the director. As of December\u00a031, 2009, all of the members of the Board had satisfied the stock ownership requirements then in effect., 405366=Our philosophy with respect to retirement benefits is to have a basic tax-qualified retirement savings plan in place \u0096 a 401(k) plan \u0096 which is available to all employees and to provide a modest company match to encourage participation. CDI\u0092s financial performance affects the amount of the matching contribution which the company makes for each employee. For 2008, up to $1,000 was matched for each corporate staff employee, but the match was suspended for 2009, to reduce costs in light of the difficult economic environment facing the company last year. The 401(k) plan provides CDI\u0092s employees with a savings program in which each employee can control how his or her savings are invested., 88448=Mr.\u00a0Karlson, age 67, has been a director of CDI since 1989. He is a private investor and consultant. He has served as a director of Campbell Soup Company since 2009 and as a director of H&E Equipment Services, Inc. since 2005. He was the Chairman of the Board of Mikron Infrared Company, Inc. from 2000 until 2007., 333759=The following table provides basic information about the payout levels established for CDI\u0092s 2009 cash incentive compensation program., 113765=The Governance and Nominating Committee oversees matters relating to Board organization and composition, compliance with rules relating to the independence of directors, and evaluations of Board and executive management effectiveness. This committee also (a)\u00a0provides the Board with recommendations of new members of the Board after evaluating candidates, and assists in attracting qualified candidates; (b)\u00a0assists the Board in selecting the company\u0092s CEO, evaluating his or her performance and making decisions about the retention of the CEO; (c)\u00a0reviews executive succession planning and executive recruitment strategies and processes and recommends procedures to assure a smooth and orderly CEO transition when the need arises; and (d)\u00a0reviews CDI\u0092s Corporate Governance Principles and recommends such changes as may be appropriate. This committee held nine meetings during 2009., 406249=Federal tax rules impose a limit on employee contributions to a 401(k) plan (that limit was $16,500 in 2009, though participants over the age of 50 can contribute more) and, due to IRS nondiscrimination testing required of such plans, a lower limit typically applies to highly-compensated employees such as the NEOs. For this reason, we have also established a nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan for our highly-compensated employees. This is a voluntary program under which the company does not make any contributions. It allows highly compensated employees who can\u0092t contribute the maximum allowable amount to their 401(k) plan account because of IRS limitations to save for retirement in a tax-effective way at minimal cost to the company. Additional information regarding the Deferred Compensation Plan can be found beginning on page 50 in connection with the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table for 2009. We believe that the Deferred Compensation Plan is an important element of a competitive compensation package for CDI\u0092s executives., 329709=To earn the target level of cash incentive compensation for 2009 based on DM$ and PTP, the company needed to hit the target levels of DM$ and PTP in CDI\u0092s 2009 financial plan. The financial plan is developed by management, and reviewed and approved by the Finance Committee, which in turn recommends it for final approval by the Board. The specific financial targets for a given year depend on a number of factors, including where CDI is in its business cycle and the size and strength of the pipeline of business with which CDI enters the year. We believe that if CDI consistently attains or exceeds its target levels of DM$ and PTP, shareholder value will increase over the long term., 199515=As of March\u00a012, 2010, the following persons and entities were known by the company to be beneficial owners of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of CDI stock. The following table shows, as of that date (or such other date as is indicated in the footnotes), the number of shares of CDI stock beneficially owned by those principal shareholders and the percentage which that number represents of the total outstanding shares of CDI stock as of that date. Under SEC rules, any shares which a person has the right to acquire (such as by exercising an option or SAR) within the sixty-day period after March\u00a012, 2010 are considered to be beneficially owned as of March\u00a012, 2010., 470312=The Stock Awards column represents the aggregate grant date fair value of TVDS, PCDS, restricted stock and SPP units received by the NEOs in a given year, calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 (without any reduction for estimated forfeitures). With respect to SPP units, only the grant date fair value of the additional SPP units received by NEOs as a result of the company match is included in this column. None of the shares of PCDS awarded in 2009 and 2008 were earned, so no value relating to those awards was included in this column for those years. See the CD&A for more information about CDI\u0092s various stock awards. The grant date fair value of Stock Awards is generally equal to the market price of CDI stock on the date of grant multiplied by the number of Stock Awards received on that date. For additional information regarding the valuation assumptions relating to CDI\u0092s Stock Awards, see Note 8 to the company\u0092s financial statements in the Form 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2009. The amounts in this column reflect the grant date fair value for, 87352=Mr.\u00a0Garrison, age 83, has been a director of CDI since 1958 and the Chairman of the Board of CDI since 1961. From 1961 until 1997, he was also the President and CEO of CDI., 831609=Shareholders of CDI are entitled to submit proposals for inclusion in the company\u0092s 2011 proxy statement, to be considered for action at the 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Proposals so submitted must be received by CDI at its principal executive offices no later than December\u00a017, 2010 and must comply in all other respects with applicable rules and regulations of the SEC relating to such inclusion. With respect to a shareholder proposal that is not included in CDI\u0092s 2011 proxy statement but which properly comes before the 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, if the company does not receive notice of such proposal at its principal executive offices by March\u00a02, 2011, then the proxy solicited by the Board for the 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders may confer discretionary voting authority on the proxy holders with respect to such proposal., 713603=The NEOs are among the employees of the company who may participate in CDI\u0092s nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan, which went into effect at the beginning of 2005. This is a voluntary program under which CDI does not make any contributions. The plan allows CDI employees who are constrained from contributing the maximum permissible amount to their 401(k) plan accounts by IRS rules applicable to highly-compensated employees to save additional money for retirement. Prior to the start of a year, participants can elect to defer a percentage (in 5% increments) of their salary and of their non-equity incentive compensation for that year. The maximum permitted deferrals are 40% of salary and 50% of non-equity incentive compensation., 103384=It is CDI\u0092s policy that all Board members are expected to attend the annual meeting of shareholders. In order to facilitate such attendance, CDI\u0092s practice is to schedule its annual shareholders\u0092 meeting on the same day as a Board meeting. At CDI\u0092s 2009 shareholders\u0092 meeting, all of the company\u0092s directors were present., 104564=The Board of Directors has established the following five standing committees to assist the Board in carrying out its responsibilities: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Executive Committee, the Finance Committee and the Governance and Nominating Committee. The charter of each of these committees is available on our website at www.cdicorp.com (in the Investor Relations section) and will be provided in print to any shareholder who delivers a written request to Investor Relations, CDI Corp., 1717 Arch Street, 35th Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19103-2768., 134659=Philadelphia, PA 19103-2768, 22039=The 2010 Annual Meeting of the Shareholders of CDI Corp. will be held on the 3rd Floor of the Comcast Center, located at 1701 JFK Boulevard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103, on Tuesday, May\u00a018, 2010 at 10:00 a.m., for the following purposes:, 735877=The company\u0092s current employment agreement with Roger Ballou, our CEO, went into effect on January\u00a01, 2008 and extended his employment term until March\u00a031, 2011. Under that agreement, if Mr.\u00a0Ballou\u0092s employment is terminated (a)\u00a0by the company other than for cause or (b)\u00a0by Mr.\u00a0Ballou if he is assigned duties that are demeaning or materially inconsistent with the position of CEO, if his place of employment is moved outside the Philadelphia area or if, following a change in control of the company, his title changes or CDI\u0092s principal offices are moved by more than fifty miles (any of these events in (b)\u00a0are referred to in Mr.\u00a0Ballou\u0092s employment agreement as \u0093Good Reason\u0094), then the company will continue to pay his base salary until the expiration of a \u0093severance period\u0094, provided that Mr.\u00a0Ballou signs a release and waiver of all claims against CDI. That \u0093severance period\u0094 is the lesser of his, 249785=Services and Fees of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for 2009 and 2008, 62265=You will have one vote for every share of CDI stock you owned on the record date (March 12, 2010)., 443461=The following table summarizes the compensation during the past three years for each person who was serving as an executive officer of CDI at the end of 2009, as well as one additional person (Cecilia Venglarik) who was an executive officer during a portion of 2009 and would have otherwise been included in the table but for the fact that she was not serving as an executive officer of CDI at the end of the year. The five people in this table were the only executive officers of CDI during 2009. Brian Short joined CDI in March 2009, so no compensation information is provided for him for 2008 and 2007., 246633=Section\u00a016(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires CDI\u0092s directors and executive officers, as well as beneficial owners of more than 10% of the outstanding shares of CDI stock, to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of CDI stock. To the company\u0092s knowledge, based on a review of copies of such reports furnished to CDI and on written representations made by such persons, all of CDI\u0092s directors, executive officers and beneficial owners of more than 10% of CDI stock have complied with all Section\u00a016(a) filing requirements with respect to 2009., 19874=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103-2768, 278316=By making a substantial portion of our executives\u0092 total compensation dependent on these measures of shareholder value, we intend to put a large part of their compensation at-risk and dependent upon their delivery of increased shareholder value. When, as in 2009, the company\u0092s financial performance is well below our targets, the compensation received by our executives falls well below the target levels., 123411=None of the members of the Compensation Committee is or has been an officer or employee of CDI or any of its subsidiaries. No executive officer of CDI served on the compensation committee of another entity (or on any other committee of the board of directors of another entity performing similar functions) during 2009, where an executive officer of that other entity served on the Compensation Committee or the Board of CDI., 248552=The independent registered public accounting firm of KPMG LLP has been appointed by the Audit Committee to continue to serve as CDI\u0092s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December\u00a031, 2010, subject to ratification by the shareholders of the company. KPMG has served the company in this capacity for many years and has gained valuable knowledge of CDI\u0092s business. The Audit Committee considers KPMG to be well qualified for this engagement. A representative of KPMG will be present at the Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement, if he or she so desires, and to respond to appropriate questions., 122257=The Compensation Committee has in the past retained the services of HayGroup, an independent outside consulting firm, to help in determining competitive compensation levels. That firm, which reported to the Committee and not to management, performed periodic reviews of competitive executive compensation levels, most recently in 2008. The nature and findings of those compensation reviews are described in the \u0093Benchmarking and Competitive Compensation\u0094 section of the CD&A. HayGroup did not perform services for the Committee in 2009. The Committee expects to retain an independent outside consulting firm in 2010 to perform a new benchmarking study., 861696=Philadelphia, PA 19103-2768, 713400=Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table for 2009, 806256=Payment under 2004 buyback program for unused paid time off, 99773=Our Corporate Governance Principles provide that the Board should have flexibility to decide whether it is best for the company at a given point in time for the roles of the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board to be separate or combined. This allows the Board to determine which structure provides the appropriate leadership for the company at a particular time. Since Walter Garrison retired as CEO of the company in 1997, he has remained Chairman and a different person has served as the CEO. The Board believes that its current leadership structure is best for CDI at this time. It allows the CEO to focus on providing the day-to-day leadership and management of the company, while the Chairman can provide guidance to the CEO, set the agenda for Board meetings (in consultation with the CEO and other members of the Board), preside over meetings of the Board, and perform other administrative functions relating to the Board\u0092s activities. The separation of roles also fosters greater independence between the Board and management. The Board considers Mr.\u00a0Garrison well-suited to be CDI\u0092s Chairman given the extensive knowledge of CDI and its business that he developed over nearly four decades as the company\u0092s CEO., 25724=Dated: April\u00a016, 2010, 323004=rewards under the cash incentive compensation program. Consistent with these principles, our CEO has the highest target payout percentage among the NEOs (at 80%), followed by our CFO and our Chief Administrative Officer (50%)\u00a0and then the other NEOs (45%). Based on these target payout percentages, the target cash incentive awards to the NEOs in 2009 were: $600,000 for Mr.\u00a0Ballou; $167,500 for Mr.\u00a0Kerschner; $108,208 for Mr.\u00a0Short (reduced to reflect his start date in March 2009); $132,300 for Mr.\u00a0Seiders; and $123,750 for Ms.\u00a0Venglarik (subsequently reduced to $89,846 to reflect the end of her executive responsibilities in September 2009)., 275194=Cecilia J. Venglarik , age 60, was CDI\u0092s Senior Vice President, Human Resources from September 2001 until September 2009., 53138=Outstanding Equity Awards at 2009 Fiscal Year-End Table, 305732=In its 2008 study, HayGroup looked at the proxy statements filed by peer group companies which are in the same businesses as CDI, but concluded that there was an insufficient number of named executive officers having the same or similar positions as Mr.\u00a0Seiders or Ms.\u00a0Venglarik in those proxy statements to provide a meaningful comparison. HayGroup therefore focused on a group of over 600 organizations in its own database to determine the market level of compensation for those two executive positions. Those organizations were in many different industries and sectors, but they all were in a size range of $500 million to $2 billion. The Committee believes that organizations of this size provide a good basis for CDI to benchmark the compensation provided to our executives, 434633=The Committee evaluates the impact of Section\u00a0162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, which limits the deductibility by the company of certain compensation in excess of $1 million per year that is paid to each NEO. The Section\u00a0162(m) regulations provide an exemption for \u0093qualified performance-based compensation\u0094. Over the years, the Committee has sought to ensure that CDI\u0092s equity compensation plans satisfy the requirements for a \u0093performance-based\u0094 plan under the Section\u00a0162(m) regulations so that any compensation to executive officers under those plans would be exempt from the deductibility limitation. Consistent with these efforts to preserve the deductibility of executive compensation, the Omnibus Plan as well as our CEO\u0092s incentive compensation arrangements were re-submitted to, and approved by, our shareholders at the 2009 annual meeting. The cash incentive compensation, stock options, PCDS and performance-based restricted stock which Mr.\u00a0Ballou has received under his previous employment agreements and may receive under his current employment agreement have been structured to satisfy the \u0093performance-based\u0094 exemption under Section\u00a0162(m).
