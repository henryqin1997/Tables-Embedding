            "Has to be on of the most secure campuses I've been on. The crime rate in the city of Decatur is low.",
            "Agnes Scott has to have one of the best values for a Private Institution. Almost every one admitted receives some kind of financial aid.",
            "The food is delicious! When visiting, I had never eaten anything that I did not like from the cafeteria.",
            "Although Freshman have to stay in the community styled dorms, they're actually really nice. One of the advantages is that the dorms have walk-in closets. The bathrooms are clean and the dorm rooms are pretty big.",
            "The courses are rigorous, but the professors are very helpful and the classes are small. This usually makes students feel comfortable about asking questions and seeking the help that is needed.",
            "Get to know your admissions counselor before you are even admitted to the school. They are very helpful and encouraging. Agnes Scott literally looks for the well-rounded student, so make sure you are versatile. Lastly, show leadership and dedication.",
            "Agnes Scott College is a small liberal-arts women's college with a gorgeous campus! They truly care about their students, and strive to create leaders. I recommend this school for any young woman."

Once the female students step in the campus and touring around the school they will feel right at home. Tips for prospective students More comfortable space, because it's a women's college that every women will feel comfortable and enjoy around the school. The academics are excellent! The faulty encourages the students to succeed. Bang for the buck I will do anything to go a women's college whether my family is poor or not, because i don't like the environment I've been experience here at Bellevue and going to the female school is my biggest dream than any other of my dreams. Will enjoy being here I always wanted to go a women's college when i grow ever since and i know my experiences will change more than I have at my school experiences here. Plus, I saw the video in the website that holds loads of information that made me realized that this kind of college would be the perfect college for me till I graduate from high school. Will learn a lot",
