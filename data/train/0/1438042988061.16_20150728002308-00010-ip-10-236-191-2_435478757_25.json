            "Text-to-Speech System for Stitcher - A text-to-speech system for a stitcher includes a tablet device in operative communication with the stitcher; the tablet device further comprising a display screen; a memory; a microprocessor; communication module; a command input device; a speaker; and a text-to-speech algorithm. An associated method includes the steps of accepting a command for operation of the stitcher from a user; transmitting the command to the text-to-speech algorithm; and producing an audible confirmation of the command through the speaker.",
            "Voice Command System for Stitchers - A voice command system for a stitcher includes a tablet device in operative communication with the stitcher; the tablet device further comprising a display screen; a memory; a microprocessor; a communication module; and a microphone; and a speech recognition algorithm operatively communicating with said tablet device. An associated method includes the steps of digitizing a user's spoken command; transmitting the digitized spoken command to the speech recognition algorithm; producing a list of words possibly comprising the spoken command; parsing the list of possible words to identify the spoken command; and initiating execution of the spoken command."
