No. 5,234,706, issued Aug. 10, 1993, titled \u201cProcesses For Products From Potatoes, And Other Roots, Seeds And Fruit\u201d,, 352784=[0410] Emily was symptom-free for months! The focus of the program has shifted toward maintaining this zero-symptom trend. Both Emily and her husband are amazed with the improvement. Emily has been cleared to eat as much from the diet foods as she wants, in order to gain weight. She has been advised to exercise regularly to build up conditioning. With a surge of renewed energy, Emily has begun to travel, enjoying her first vacation in years. On September 23rd she and her husband will be featured in a song and dance festival. She is handling a grueling practice schedule with ease., 31888=[0012] U.S. Pat. No. 4,929,467, issued May 29, 1990, titled \u201cProcesses For Products From Lotus\u201d,, 32274=[0014] Canadian Patent No. 1,313,602, filed on Feb. 2, 1987, issued Feb. 16, 1993, titled \u201cFlour, Bread, Milk, And Other Products From White Sweet Potatoes, Cassava, Edible Aroids, Amaranth, Yams, And Lotus\u201d., 357286=[0421] Case Summary: FIG. 4 shows the improvements in symptom averages for a child experiencing extensive food allergies and chemical sensitivities. Caroline first contacted the instant intervention program of Applicant in 1998. At 18 months, her daughter, Anne, suffered from extensive food allergies. Constantly bloated and nauseous, Anna had very frequent loose and bloody stools. Her constant stomachache and overall discomfort made her generally irritable and fatigued. To Caroline, Anna's eyes looked glossed over; she always seemed distant, withdrawn, and \u201czoned out.\u201d Anna's face was covered with a severe eczema-like rash and she always had dark circles and puffiness under her eyes. Furthermore, Anna had frequent ear infections and red, hot feet. Also, Anna was often extremely thirsty, but due to her bed-wetting habit, Caroline was hesitant to give her many liquids., 349645=[0405] Case Summary: FIG. 3 shows the improvements in symptom averages for an adult experiencing fatigue, diarrhea and anxiety. Emily entered the research program in April of 2000 with an exasperating case. Emily had suffered for many years from several food-induced ailments including diarrhea, stomach grumbling, and intestinal cramps; she was also debilitated with severe fatigue that limited most activities. In addition, because her diarrhea was so severe, Emily was losing a lot of fluids. For years Emily had been unable to leave her home. Emily had also been unhealthily thin all of her life. She had tried numerous treatments from a variety of clinics and found nothing to help her., 360242=[0425] Approach: Officially, Anna began the Instant diet in 1998. Although a strict 7-day rotation diet was set up, her mother rearranged the foods without consulting the staff. Therefore, This investigator had limited involvement during the first 27 months of Anna's diet. Furthermore, the recommendation for the termination of Anna's exposure to chemical and environmental irritants of church and stores was consistently rejected. As a result, only a 40 percent reduction symptoms occurred. In addition, an ineffective 3-day rotation of the foods caused Anna to develop sensitivities to several of the unusual foods. During the 28th month, Anna's mother finally agreed to follow a 5-day rotation diet of the remaining non-allergic foods and consented to limit Anna's exposure to environmental sensitivities. As a result, the overall symptom level dropped 92.7 percent. At the moment, Anna's diet is being held at this stable and comfortable level in order to allow her body to adjust. Once her system has \u201chealed,\u201d Anna will finally be ready to begin dietary expansion., 31018=[0006] U.S. Pat. No. 5,204,137, issued Apr. 20, 1993, titled \u201cProcesses For Products From Sweet Potato\u201d,, 356713=[0419] B. Pollen: Some of Emily's digestive symptoms, apparent after the third week of treatment, and again in August and September resulted from a sensitivity to pollen. The symptoms of diarrhea and fatigue experienced in August and September were entirely due to pollen exposures. Pollen exposure and associated symptoms were completely eliminated in the spring and similar results are expected this fall., 31167=[0007] U.S. Pat. No. 4,911,943, issued Mar. 27, 1990, titled \u201cProcesses For Products From Amaranth\u201d,, 32029=[0013] PCT Patent WO87/04599, filed Feb. 2, 1987, issued Aug. 1, 1988, titled \u201cFlour, Bread, Milk, And Other Products From White Sweet Potatoes, Cassava, Edible Aroids, Amaranth, Yams, And Lotus\u201d, and, 116856=[0166] In another example a 40 year old woman suffering from severe diarrhea, fatigue, and shortness of breath underwent the above described dietary intervention program of applicant. Within about 8 weeks all of the subject's symptoms had been relieved. Several months later, starting in mid-August, the symptoms of severe diarrhea, fatigue, and shortness of breath began to reappear, becoming very intense during the first two weeks in September in spite of the fact that the diet was unchanged in anyway. Knowing that food was not a factor, this investigator noted the pattern paralleled precisely the ragweed pollen season in the subject's area, and recommended procedures for completely avoiding exposure to pollens. The subject, within a few days of implementing these recommendations, became symptom-free again. The instant dietary intervention approach of applicant makes it possible to clearly associate symptoms associated with pollen exposure that are previously unknown and unrecognized in the Art. This is due to the fact that these pollen-related effects can now be clearly seen in the absence of symptoms from other factors such as foods and multiple chemical sensitivities., 451806=[0602] Case Summary: FIG. 16 shows the improvements in symptom averages for an autistic child also suffering from infantile spasms and diarrhea. Born into a family with a discouraging medical history of multiple sclerosis, Heather came to the instant intervention program of Applicant with the odds stacked against her. Heather, a 27-month-old autistic child, is also affected with infantile spasms and seizures of the brain stem. Heather was also born colicky with a high sensitivity to light and sound. When Heather first came to the instant intervention program of Applicant in April 2000, her symptoms were severe and debilitating. She had 15-20 seizures per day and took several medications, including lamictal, topomax and B6, to keep the seizures from becoming even more frequent. Heather also had a severe diaper rash that created dry, bright red skin with bloody patches and raised areas. Furthermore, she had very painful bowel movements and diarrhea, which exacerbated the diaper rash irritation. She sometimes gagged resulting in the constant spitting up and vomiting, of foods. In addition, Heather's entire body was hypotonic, her head was sensitive to touch, and she had difficulty sleeping, vocalizing words and using her hands., 427437=[0554] Tony's parents contacted The instant intervention program of Applicant hoping to improve Tony's behavior and physical health. Setting up a diet for Tony was tricky since he would only eat crunchy and crisp foods that his mother had fried. These limitations were taken into consideration and Tony began the Instant Autism Intervention Program in April of 2000., 417560=[0533] In October 1999, Ben's mom enrolled Ben in the instant intervention program of Applicant. \u2018Ben has come so far, but something is still holding him back. I think gluten-free, casein-free is not enough.\u2019 Pamela left the conference with an individually tailored diet that was the diet Ben needed and with a method to make sure not one single problem food remained in his diet. Ben still needed to begin with food choices that were appropriate for the rituals he surrounded himself with. So Pam's initial 5-week food choices were a first for the instant intervention program of Applicant, an all muffin version of the Instant dietary intervention program of Applicant., 30388=[0003] U.S. Pat. No. 5,789,012, issued Aug. 4, 1998, titled \u201cProducts From Sweet Potatoes, Cassava, Edible Aroids, Amaranth, Yams, Lotus, Potatoes, And Other Roots, Seeds And Fruit\u201d,, 31600=[0010] U.S. Pat. No. 4,925,697, issued May 15, 1990, titled \u201cProcess For Products From Sweet Potato\u201d,, 29962=[0001] Provisional Application No. 60/164,857, filed Nov. 12, 1999, entitled \u201cUsing Unusual Foods To Create Symptom-Free Diets For Persons With Food Allergies, Sensitivities And Intolerances\u201d is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference., 462606=[0621] Approach: Mark had been eating gluten-free casein-free foods since January 2000. Although this dietary change did yield positive results, his mother hoped for complete elimination of allergy symptoms. During the first eight weeks, Lisa followed the diet plan on her own. After the ninth week, the research investigator and counselors were consulted to formulate a more regulated rotation of the diet foods. Because Mark exhibited a delayed reaction to foods, cause-affect assessments were more challenging. Although Mark experienced a few setbacks due to the accidental re-exposure to non-diet foods, his symptoms have dropped over 80 percent from his original condition., 30794=[0005] U.S. Pat. No. 5,244,689, issued Sep. 14, 1993, titled \u201cFlour, Bread, Milk, And Other Products From White Sweet Potatoes, Cassava, Edible Aroids, Amaranth, Yams, And Lotus\u201d,, 31457=[0009] U.S. Pat. No. 4,925,696, issued May 15, 1990, titled \u201cProcesses For Products From Malanga\u201d,, 31746=[0011] U.S. Pat. No. 4,923,709, issued May 8, 1990, titled \u201cProcesses For Products From Cassava\u201d,, 68462=[0067] Although the fresh root form of tropical root crops may be the most well tolerated of all carbohydrates, they still present the primary, fundamental disadvantage that they always have, namely not concentrated enough to easily maintain adequate nourishment. Children 7-10 years in age, for example, require 330 grams of carbohydrates per day for adequate nourishment according to the Recommended dietary Allowances of the National Research Council (National Academy of Sciences, 1980, Recommended Dietary Allowances, 9th edition). The average root contains about 90 grams per pound. To meet the carbohydrate requirement for resting and light activity, the average 7 year old child must eat almost 4 pounds per day, and a moderately active, 180 pound teenage boy must eat a minimum of 7.25 pounds of tropical roots per day to meet his recommended dietary allowance for carbohydrates.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0637] B. Fumes: Matthew's father works as a printing press operator and Jenny was concerned about the fumes affecting Matthew and exacerbating his symptoms. It was recommended that her husband go straight to the shower after work, immediately put his work clothes in the washer and use fragrance-free soap. [0636] A. Chemical Sensitivities: While Matthew was on the Diet, his mother became aware of an increased sensitivity to chlorine in tap water when Matthew became sensitive to bathing. To alleviate this chemical sensitivity, she used only distilled water to bathe Matthew, brush his teeth and diaper him. She also began washing his clothes with Neolife Green detergent and doing a final hand rinse in distilled water. [0635] 2. Environmental Considerations [0634] B. Non-Diet Foods: Although Matthew's symptoms improved when he adhered to the specific Diet, he managed to stray from the diet and eat a crust of pizza on two occasions. These deviations produced severe flare-ups in his symptoms, especially his self stimulating behavior. A similar pattern was observed when Matthew took a gulp of grape juice. These incidents convinced Jenny that Matthew's symptoms were related to his diet. [0633] A. Withdrawal: Matthew was accustomed to eating only squash, chickpea flour and chicken when he began the diet. During the first few days on the Instant plan, Matthew would not eat the",
