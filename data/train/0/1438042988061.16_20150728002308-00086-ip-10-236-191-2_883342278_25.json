            "The best thing you can do is stay focused in class but then after, meet up with some friends and relax in the library in between classes. Also, attending sports games are very fun!",
            "There is a cute little Starbucks coffee shop in the math building that is very relaxing and a great place to study. The cafeteria also isn't too bad!",
            "There is no dorming on this campus, but if there was, I would give it a 5!",
            "A challenging part about college is that there are so many students attending, it can get very immpersonal with the teachers. PVCC professors do a great job at trying to help the best they can.",
            "Be sure to study for your tests and never slack on homework. Also, take advantage of the tutors and never be afraid to ask questions when needed.",
            "I am very pleased with the professors that teach the classes at PVCC. I would recommend this college to anyone of my friends and family. I cannot wait to complete the rest of my Associates degree here!"

I would just keep up to date with deadlines on the schools website and by calling the school to make sure of deadline dates in case there had been changes.
