The 5 bedroom condo splept our party of 8 extremely comfortable. This was my first time in Aspen and the property manger Cam Murray was amazing! We arrived after hours, but he promptly had the keys to us and gave our group a tour of the property. He continually went out of his way suggesting reasturants, outdoor opportunities, and the best nightlife hot spots. The property and Cam Murray made this a trip our group will never forget.
