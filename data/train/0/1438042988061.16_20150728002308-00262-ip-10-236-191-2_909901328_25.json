            "We have a university police department and police call boxes located on campus. Other than that, you're on your own. It's a large campus, and there are a lot of woods and things. At night it is poorly lit. Also, the freshman dorms are connected to these underground tunnels, one of which leads to a loading dock. This loading dock is often open/unlocked. Literally anyone could come in if they wanted, in fact I'm sure they have. We've had a lot of sexual assaults and things, so watch out. Keep your wits about you and hopefully you'll be alright. Culture Shock and Zombie Prom are probably the most dangerous times during the school year. Watch out for strange looking people who seem like they're staking out easy entry points around the dorms (especially the ground-level freshman dorms) in the days leading up to these events. It's actually a problem, my friends and I had to call the cops one time because we saw a guy in his 50s with a notepad and a camera snooping around the freshman dorms. The campus is technically public property so anyone and their mother can just walk on.",
            "None.",
            "All the clubs meet really late on weeknights, so screw that. I've tried starting clubs here. It's a long tedious bureaucratic process that takes all the fun out of everything. Also, oftentimes no one shows up to them. Obviously there are exceptions, but those are mostly the sexual and ethnic themed clubs, like SOCA or LGBTQU.",
            "Artists (for now), Kids looking to play D3 sports, Drag Queens, basically the left-most side of the political spectrum.",
            "The biggest thing this school has going for it is the price. That's why I came, because I'm broke. Otherwise I would so have preferred a private school, or maybe even another state school. This place is terribly underfunded, so the facilities suck and the staff can be thin in certain majors. If you're looking for a BA in the liberal arts, it's cool because you can do your undergrad pretty cheap. If you're looking for a BFA and get into a conservatory, then congratulations on getting to utilize the majority of this schools funds. It's probably a better school for commuters. If you're close enough, don't live here.",
            "You want the honest answer? Drinking and drugs. That's what there is to do. Well, alright we do have activities, but they're often dull and not very engaging. Most of the school sponsored dance parties are the ones by Latinos Unidos and SOCA, which can be really fun, but if it's not your type of music (latin, hip-hop, jamaican dancehall) then you're probably not going to find many dance parties, unless you find an apartment party with music you like. That said, at most apartment parties there's very little room so you can barely dance, and they get shut down quick anyway. This is why most people here pass the time by smoking themselves silly or drinking until they pass out. Or by taking heroin or something. Apparently we also have a heroin problem here.",
            "I think Purchase is infamous for how terrible the food is. The Dining Hall (which we lovingly call D-Hall) is by far the worst but it's all-you-can-eat so there's that. There's the Hub, which is basically like a food court in a trashy suburban mall. Everything there is either dripping with grease or laden with salt. Then there's Terra Ve, which is our vegetarian option. They bill it as being healthier or something but that's really a load of bull. It's mostly all carbs and it's all deep-fried. We do have a Starbucks. That's basically like any other Starbucks out there, except you can use your meal card there. Of course, it's super expensive so you'll probably spend all your meals in a week if you're a regular.",
            "Most of the facilities are absolute crap. The ones that have been renovated or more recently constructed may look a bit shinier, but the quality is very low. It's very easy to cause damages in the dorms/apartments and at the end of the year they go through with a fine-toothed comb, so you can be sure that you will be charged for anything wrong. One year I was charged $30 just because there was a gum wrapper on the floor...seriously. As for Residence Life, they have gotten EXTREMELY strict in the past few years. For the most part, any parties are shut down within an hour of starting. That said, any time you have anyone other than the assigned people in your living space, ResLife considers it a party. If you make any noise that can be heard outside of your room/apartment, you can expect to hear a knock at the door and then have to explain yourself to an RA. They are VERY quick to call the university police on you, but it's typically alright because the cops here don't really care. Most of the ResLife staff are actually students and they have a tendency to go on crazy power trips. They're often extremely condescending, but are more or less at their liberty to write you up for whatever, even for so much as the tone of your voice. Basically, it sucks. Also, they just banned cigarettes. If that's a plus for you, great. For me, it means withdrawal.",
            "It's 50/50. Depending on your professor, class, or major, work can be either extremely easy or extremely difficult. It's pretty easy to gauge which classes will be harder. I've noticed for many classes they force you to buy these super expensive textbooks and for the most part you can get away with never even opening them.",
            "If your politics are anything other than totally hardcore liberal, then you're going to have a bad time. I mean this seriously. I find that a lot of people here are so liberal it makes them close-minded. If you say anything that can be remotely construed as politically incorrect, someone WILL call you out on it, whether you deserve it or not, and then people will gang up on you. I've seen this happen to people. You almost want to try and help them out but you don't want people to turn on you too.",
            "Purchase is a great school if you're looking for cheaper tuition and can look past mediocre programs and sub-par facilities. Visual artists will probably like it here more than anyone else. It's also one of those places where people go so out of their way to be original that they tend to all be the same."

Food and Dining the food is ok, its good for dorm food and the chefs here come up with some unique food combinations (like chicken and potato eggs) and theme days (wacky wing wednesday or ice cream friday). purchase college is also one of the top ten vegan friendly colleges in",
