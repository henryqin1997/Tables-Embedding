    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Bang for the buck this is a good campus for getting your general education requirements out of the way. it is only a community college branch of nmsu which most people don't realize. What to do for fun i love to play board games with my husband and friends. just hanging out and watching tv or movies is fun too. Food and Dining i have not dined on campus, but i am sure it is fine. Tips for prospective students you must be dedicated if you plan on taking online courses. otherwise, you may really struggle to keep up. In three sentences the only courses i've taken were online so i can't give a campus review. i really loved my human biology class. i plan to transfer to the main campus in las cruces this summer to pursue a bachelor of science in biochemistry, but will still be taking some lower level courses online or on campus here in alamogordo.
