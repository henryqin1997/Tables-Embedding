After making his first-class and list A debuts in 2004, his ODI opportunities were initially limited, but as Paul Hoffman fell out of favour Nel took the chance to secure a permanent place in the team as Scotland looked to the future. In May 2007 he was signed by Worcestershire after a 10-day trial, and bowled impressively for the county's second XI. In his first Championship match, against Yorkshire, he claimed a promising 4 for 74. He spent only one season at the county, however, and also struggled through a lean spell in international cricket in 2007, picking up only two wickets in six one-day internationals in the year. He began the 2008 summer with a career-best 4 for 25 against Ireland at Aberdeen, and was also one of Scotland's stand-out bowlers at the World Twenty20 Qualifiers with nine wickets - the most in the tournament. At the end of 2008 he was one of three Scotland players to be awarded central contracts, a significant step forward in Scottish cricket. Nel settled into the role of senior bowler in Scotland's attack, and in 2010 earned another crack at county cricket with a two-year contract at Kent.
