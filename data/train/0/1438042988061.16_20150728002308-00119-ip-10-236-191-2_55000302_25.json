    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{70784=Oakland took the opening kickoff and moved 79 yards on 13 plays but the march stalled at the nine-yard line after two Campbell incompletions. The visitors settled for Sebastian Janikowski's 27-yard field goal to take a 3-0 lead., 71665=San Francisco took a 10-6 lead on the final play of the third quarter on Smith's 32-yard TD pass down the middle to a leaping Crabtree in the end zone. It came one play after Smith was whistled for intentional grounding and capped off a 13-play, 91-yard drive that took 8:11 off the clock., 69732=Smith connected on 16-of-33 passes, including scoring tosses to Michael Crabtree and Vernon Davis as the 49ers (1-5) won for the first time this season to avoid their first 0-6 start since 1979., 71294=The Niners finally got on the board with eight ticks left in the half on Joe Nedney's 25-yard field goal that finished off a 10-play, 77-yard drive. The key plays on the march were a 19-yard swing pass to Brian Westbrook on 2nd- and-5 from the home team's 21, and a 35-yard catch and run by Josh Morgan to the Raiders 13 on a first down just across midfield., 70503=Jason Campbell, filling in for the injured Bruce Gradkowski, struggled in his first start since Week 2, completing just 8-of-21 passes for 83 yards for the Raiders (2-4), who haven't finished .500 or better through the season's first six games since going 4-2 in 2002., 71025=On the first play of the second quarter, Louis Murphy raced down the right sideline for 43 yards on a reverse that put the ball at the Niners' 12. San Francisco's defense held, and Janikowski hit a 24-yarder to make it 6-0 with 12:40 left before the break., 71967=After each team went three-and-out, the Raiders took over at their own 23 with 11:14 to play in the game., 72085=Zach Miller made a 22-yard grab and then caught a deflected throw on the next play for 26 more to move the Raiders to the San Francisco 27. However, the set was stymied at the 25 leading to Janikowski's 42-yard boot that trimmed the lead to one with 8:21 remaining in the game., 73219=Again, the teams traded punts and the Raiders regained possession at their 13 with 3:14 to go in a possible last-ditch effort to tie the game. However, Campbell was intercepted on third down by a diving Takeo Spikes, who was downed at the Oakland 19 with 2:39 still to play.}",
