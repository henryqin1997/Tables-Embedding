(B) RPA reactions were established in 96-well microwell plates, with a final volume of 100 \u03bcl per reaction volume. A defined number of copies of human genomic DNA was pipetted into wells in to the 96-well plate, and stored on ice. A reaction mastermix was mixed on ice, and then aliquoted in the wells containing DNA and mixed well. The reactions were then transferred to the pre-warmed plate of BIOTEK FLX 800 fluorescent microplate reader. The reaction composition was 50 mM Tris pH 8.4, 80 mM Potassium acetate, 10 mM Magnesium acetate, 2 mM DTT, 200 \u03bcM dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 50 ng/\u03bcl creatine kinase, 1.5 mM ATP, 30 mM phosphocreatine, 300 nM ApoB4 primer, 300 nM Apo300 primer, 5% Carbowax 20M, 360 ng/\u03bcl gp32, 86 ng/\u03bcl uvsX, 15 ng/\u03bcl uvsY, 35 ng/\u03bcl Bsu polymerase, and 1:50,000 dilution of the DMSO stock of SYBR green from molecular probes. Note that, as in Example 2 (C), the highest concentration of target generated a curve which trailed off unexpectedly early. As with FIG. 55 these experiments were performed under conditions of uvsX, uvsY, gp32, ATP and dNTP concentrations that may require finessing to ensure robust detectable exponential phase at higher target concentrations. This is supported by (C), in which a similar experiment was performed to that in (B), except that concentrations of certain reagents were as follows: gp32 was used at 600 ng/\u03bcl, uvsX was used at 140 ng/\u03bcl, uvsY was used at 35 ng/\u03bcl, ATP was at 3 mM. After reactions had finished 7 \u03bcl of the reactions was diluted with 1\ufffd sucrose loading buffer and separated on a 2% agarose gel.}",

J Biol Chem. 1987 Jul. 5; 262(19):9285-92, 525376=Three primer pairs were employed and in each case a comparison is made between no starting template and approximately 10, 100, 1000, 3000, and 10,000 copies of the genomic target. In all cases, clear amplification was detected when at least 1000 copies of the genomic target were used (a weak signal is seen with the best primer pair at 100 copies). We concluded that during that lsRPA reactions configured in this way were capable of amplifying DNA from very complex targets with a sensitivity of at least 1000 copies, and potentially higher., 747271=As above this example would involve amplification of the TPOX STR marker used in forensics. The amplification conditions would be the same as for Example 18 except that the ratio of amplification primers would be 1:1, with both used at a concentration of 0.3 \u03bcM. The amplification reaction is then contacted to an array of single-stranded probes corresponding to the known possible polymorphic forms of the DNA under study. With this format the recombinase loads preferentially onto the probes which then search and form hybrids with the double-stranded sample DNAs. As in Example 18 hybrids will ideally become enriched if they are perfect, and similarly the inclusion of agents such as helicases (e.g. PriA, recG, DnaB, RuvAB, gp41, or dda) or appropriate nucleases can accelerate and improve this enrichment. After a suitable incubation period, with or without arrest of the reaction as necessary, interactions are visualized as described in Example 18., 464568=Kornberg, A. and Baker, T. A. (1992). DNA Replication. New York: W. H. Freeman and Company. Kuil et al., Biophys Chem. 1988 December; 32(2-3):211-27, 216570=As another example, the following reagents can be assembled by combining each reagent such that when constituted, they will have the following concentrations: (1) 100-200 ng/\u03bcl uvsX recombinase; (2) 300-1000 ng/\u03bcl gp32; (3) 10-50 ng/\u03bcl Bsu polymerase or T4 polymerase; (4) 50-500 \u03bcM dNTPs; (5) 0.1 to 10 mM DTT; (6) 3 mM ATP or an ATP analog; (7) 16 ng/\u03bcl to 60 ng/\u03bcl uvsY; (8) 50 nM to 1000 nM of a first primer and 50 nM to 1000 nM of a second primer; (9) 40 mM to 160 mM Potassium acetate; (10) 5 mM to 20 mM Magnesium acetate; (11) 10 mM to 40 mM Phosphocreatine; (12) 50 ng/\u03bcl to 200 ng/\u03bcl Creatine kinase. These reagents are freeze dried and stored. In use, the reagents are reconstituted with Tris-acetate buffer at a concentration of between 1 mM to 60 mM and polyethylene glycol at a concentration of between 1% to 12% by weight or by volume. The primers, item 8 above, may be omitted before freeze drying and added after reconstitution. To initiate the RPA, a target nucleic acid, or a sample suspected of containing a target nucleic acid is added. The reaction is incubated until a desired degree of amplification is achieved., 351402=We have demonstrated that enzymatic components from heterologous systems can be combined together effectively in various RPA formats. For example, both the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I, the Bst DNA polymerase of Bacillus stearothermophilus, and the large fragment of Bacillus subtilis polymerase I, can extend recombination products generated with the uvsX recombinase of bacteriophage T4 in the presence of the bacteriophage T4 gp32 protein. This suggests that the class of polymerases similar to E. coli Pol I are generally effective in RPA reactions, and this may reflect their distinctive properties as strand displacing enzymes, combined with access to recombination intermediates needed for their repair activities. Furthermore, that elongation of recombination intermediates can easily be mediated by polymerases from widely different structure groups is uncertain. Despite early indications from end-directed recombination intermediates stabilized by backfire synthesis, we have been unable to drive RPA reactions using Phi-29 polymerase, and this may reflect that this enzyme cannot readily load onto recombination intermediates. There may be additional synergistic effects when proteins from the same organism are employed together. For example there are known to be physical interactions between the bacteriophage T4 components such as uvsY and uvsX, as well as gp32. This might be extended to other components, foe example the T4 polymerase functionally interacts with the gp41 helicase, and physically with gp32 (Formosa and Alberts PNAS 80, 2442-2446, 1983). However despite the seeming attractiveness of using components from the same organism to enhance RPA efficiency, we have found that one helicase employed for processive DNA synthesis by T4 polymerase may not combine easily with the effective RPA environment as established here. Early experiments suggested that inclusion of T4 dda helicase may disrupt the coating of oligonucleotides in the RPA environment and lead to excessive primer noise preventing sensitive RPA reactions. This is consistent with an earlier published report [insert reference JBC. 1991 May 25; 266(15):9712-8 Inhibition of protein-mediated homologous pairing byb a DNA helicase.

In leading and lagging strand RPA, ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP may also be included for synthesis of RNA primers. In addition, ddNTPs (ddATP, ddTTP, ddGTP and ddGTP) may be used to generate fragment ladders. The dNTP may be used at a concentration of between 1 \u03bcM to 200 \u03bcM of each NTP species. A mixture of dNTP and ddNTP may be used with ddNTP concentrations at 1/100 to 1/1000 of that of the dNTP (1 \u03bcM to 200 \u03bcM)., 523725=Three primer pairs were employed, and in each case a comparison was made between no input genomic DNA, 10,000 copies of uncut human genomic DNA, and 10,000 copies of HpaII cut genomic DNA (which generates at least one end for the primer pairs). In all cases, specific amplification of the desired DNA sequence occurred, while the efficiency showed variation between primer pairs, and between uncut and cut DNAs. In all cases, prior HpaII digestion of the DNA sample was not absolutely required, but improved the efficiency of amplification. In all cases, input genomic DNA was important. In the best amplification (shown in lane 4), we estimated at least 1011 molecules, indicating an amplification of the approximate order 107., 776180=1:50,000 dilution from stock of SYBR green (Molecular probes), 458612=Alexseyev, A. A., Bakhlanova, I. V., Zaitsev, E. N. and Lanzov, V. A. (1996). Genetic characteristics of new RecA mutants of Escherichia coli K-12. J Bacteriol 178, 2018-24., 420149=The Km of ATP hydrolysis by recA is reported to be 20 \u03bcM. Consequently relatively little free ATP needs to be released into a recombinase system to promote activity. Assuming this is also true for uvsX, a pulse of ATP that changes the reaction concentration from zero to 50 \u03bcM would amply support homology searching until such time that the ADP level accumulates to a 1:1 ratio. Under standard conditions this would be roughly 30 seconds and would eventually produce 25 \u03bcm ADP and 25 \u03bcM ATP. A 30 second burst of recombinase activity is likely to be longer than what is required for a round of invasions to occur. Additional pulses of ATP can readily generate additional bursts of recombinase activity. For example a further pulse of 50 \u03bcM rise would raise the ATP level to 75 \u03bcm compared to 25 \u03bcM ADP. After 30 seconds the ATP level will equilibrate to 50 \u03bcM ATP and 50 \u03bcm ADP and the reaction will again halt. A further pulse will raise the ATP to 100 \u03bcM and the ADP to 50 \u03bcm, and after 30 seconds further 75 \u03bcM of each will be equilibrated. Thus 30 second bursts of excess ATP could be released in 50 \u03bcM bursts to support burst of recombinase activity. Of course the changing overall absolute concentrations of ADP and ATP are likely to affect the reaction behaviour necessitating adjustments and possibly slightly larger pulses of ATP may need to be release at each round. Nevertheless it is apparent that with a starting concentration of caged-ATP of 3 mM (similar to that used in our earlier experiments) and pulses of 50 \u03bcM, it is possible to support 60 independent pulses. Even if the burst size needs to increase progressively to account for the overall increase in ADP concentration it is fairly likely that 30 cycles can be accommodated. Furthermore the ADP may be removed from the reaction by inclusion of ADP metabolising enzymes in the reaction. These could include hydrolysis of ADP, or alternatively regeneration of ADP to ATP and a constant source of alternative consuming ATP activity such as NADH generation., 461882=Formosa T, Alberts B M.

Biophys J 82(4): 2198-2210, 149818=Thus, the described Zarling method, at best, is likely to generate little more than small quantities of ssDNA copies from each template. The linear amplification potentially given by the Zarling method will only occur in the presence of SSB, since the displaced strand will continue to bind to the second interaction site on RecA, and single-stranded DNA will not be released (Mazin, A. V. and Kowalczykowski, S.C. (1998). EMBO J 17, 1161-8). This probably explains why the Zarling method observed additional faster-migrating fragments when they included SSB. These additional fragments were most likely displaced single-stranded fragments. Hence, in the Zarling method only linear amplification of single-stranded DNA will occur at best. There is, therefore, a need in the art for an improved recombinase-dependent DNA amplification method., 469655=Salinas F, Jiang H, Kodadek T. J Biol Chem. 1995 Mar. 10; 270(10):5181-6.

In the cases where amplification occurred, almost the entire of population of oligonucleotides was consumed indicating an amplification of 3-5\ufffd104. The reaction components are indicated. Included in some samples are additional components. We found that 200 \u03bcM ADP-\u03b2-S slightly increased the amount of product generated under these conditions. Conversely under the conditions used here, addition of E. coli toposiomerase I inhibited amplification. Under the conditions used, we detected no amplification with uvsX\u039421(C) protein. However, no PEG1450 was included in these samples, and uvsX(C) did not amplify either under these conditions without PEG1450., 471697=Volodin A A, Camerini-Otero R D (2002).

DNA helicases displace streptavidin from biotin-labeled oligonucleotides. Biochemistry April 20; 38(16):5164-71, 203274=The primers used may be made from DNA, RNA, PNA, LNA, morpholino backbone nucleic acid, phosphorothiorate backbone nucleic acid and a combination thereof. Combinations thereof in this can refers to a single nucleic acid molecules which may contain one or more of one base connected to one of more of another base. Preferred concentration of these molecules may be in the range of between 25 nM to 1000 nM. In one preferred embodiment, the primers may contain a non-phosphate linkage between the two bases at its 3\u2032 end and is resistant to 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 nuclease activity. In another embodiment, the primers may contain a locked nucleic acid at its 3\u2032 ultimate base or 3\u2032 penultimate base. For example, in a nucleic acid of the sequence 5\u2032-AGT-3\u2032, the T is the 3\u2032 ultimate base and the G is the 3\u2032 penultimate base. The primers may be at least 20 bases in length or at least 30 bases in length. In one preferred embodiment, the primers are between 20 to 50 bases in length. In another preferred embodiment, the primers are between 20 to 40 bases in length such as between 30 to 40 bases in length., 207195=The reaction may be incubated between 5 minutes and 16 hours, such as between 15 minutes and 3 hours or between 30 minutes and 2 hours. The incubation may be performed until a desired degree of amplification is achieved. The desired degree of amplification may be 10 fold, 100 fold, 1000 fold, 10,000 fold, 100,000 fold or 1000000 fold amplification. Incubation temperature may be between 20\ufffd C. and 50\ufffd C., between 20\ufffd C. and 40\ufffd C., such as between 20\ufffd C. and 30\ufffd C. One advantage of the methods of the invention is that the temperature is not critical and precise control, while preferred, is not absolutely necessary. For example, in a field environment, it is sufficient to keep the RPA at room temperature, or close to body temperature (35\ufffd C. to 38\ufffd C.) by placing the sample in a body crevice. Furthermore, the RPA may be performed without temperature induced melting of the template nucleic acid., 468834=Pierre, A. and Paoletti, C. (1983).

For example, the kit may contain (1) 100-200 ng/\u03bcl uvsX recombinase; (2) 300 ng/\u03bcl to 1000 ng/\u03bcl gp32; (3) 10 ng/\u03bcl to 50 ng/\u03bcl Bsu polymerase or T4 polymerase; (4) 50 \u03bcM to 500 \u03bcM dNTPs; (5) 0.1 to 10 mM DTT; (6) 1 mM to 5 mM ATP or an ATP analog; (7) 16 ng/\u03bcl to 60 ng/\u03bcl uvsY; (8) 50 nM to 1000 nM of a first primer and 50 nM to 1000 nM of a second primer (optional); (9) 40 mM to 160 mM Potassium acetate; (10) 5 mM to 20 mM Magnesium acetate; (11) 10 mM to 40 mM Phosphocreatine; (12) 50 ng/\u03bcl to 200 ng/\u03bcl Creatine kinase., 463708=Hsieh P, Camerini-Otero C S, Camerini-Otero R D. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1992 Jul. 15; 89(14):6492-6, 264418=Despite the clear requirement for single-stranded binding proteins, these proteins generally have a considerably higher affinity for single-stranded DNA than recombinases such as recA, or uvsX, and can inhibit nucleation of recombinase/DNA filaments. Moreover, as filaments formed in the presence of ATP undergo end-dependant disassembly (Bork, Cox and Inman J Biol Chem. 2001 Dec. 7; 276(49):45740-3), such filaments are likely to be rapidly saturated with single-stranded binding proteins and inactivated soon after initiation of the reaction. Thus for efficient RPA conditions that prevent inactivation of the reaction components are key in establishing robust amplification., 353790=In some formats of RPA, such as when a large DNA product is desired, a processive polymerase would be the optimal choice. Under these conditions, however, there is significant likelihood that replication complexes will converge with one another on the same template. There is a danger that replication complexes will become locked head-to head so that neither can pass. Most useful in this situation are polymerases that are both processive and able to resolve collisions as has been demonstrated for Phi29 DNA polymerase (Elias-Arnanz M, Salas M. EMBO J. 1997 Sep. 15; 16(18):5775-83). Alternatively a fine but critical balance of an ideal level of processivity to permit useful replicative runs combined with a distributive capacity to dissociate fairly frequently may solve this issue., 458825=Bar-Ziv R, Libchaber A. (2001). Effects of DNA sequence and structure on binding of RecA to single-stranded DNA. PNAS USA July 31; 98(16):9068-73, 713153=Schematic representation of the relationship of oligonucleotide primers to one another. LNA1 and DNA1 are identical except that LNA1 contains a LNA sugar at the most 3\u2032 position. Likewise LNA2 and DNA2 differ similarly. (sequence of LNA/DNA1 is:GCTCCTTGGACTGGTAGATGTCACACTTGTG\u2014SEQ ID 74, sequence of LNA/DNA2 is GCCTTGGCTCTGCTGTGCGCATGTGACTTAGC\u2014SEQ ID 75). (B) RPA reactions were assembled with the indicated oligonucleotide primer combinations. Product levels are significantly reduced when both oligonucleotides contain a 3\u2032 LNA under standard reaction conditions. However substitution of only one oligonucleotide does not suppress the reaction too greatly (lanes 2 and 3). Note that the background pattern in lane 3 resembles that in lane 4, while in 2 it is largely absent. This suggests that the background derives principally from the activities of a single primer species. Amplification conditions were: 50 mM Tris.Cl pH 8.3, 90 mM Magnesium acetate, 2 mM DTT, 80 mM Potassium acetate, 200 \u03bcM dNTPs, 800 ng/\u03bcl gp32, 200 ng/\u03bcl uvsX, 60 ng/\u03bcl uvsY, 300 nM primers, 20 ng/\u03bcl Bsu polymerase, 50 copies/\u03bcl genomic DNA, 120 minutes at 37\ufffd C. (C) Increasing the levels of polymerase result in restoration of robust activity when two LNA-modified oligonucleotides are used. LNA1 and LNA2, or DNA1 and DNA2, were combined in the presence of the indicated concentrations of polymerase. Notably the DNA primers displayed high activity at the lowest used concentration, and if anything the products looked less good as polymerase concentration was increased. Short products, 50-100 base pairs, are notably also seen. Conversely the LNA primers were only optimally active at higher polymerase concentrations. Less small products were seen, and those seen other than the expected size are likely product related (see below). Amplification conditions were: 50 mM Tris.Cl pH 8.3, 90 mM Magnesium acetate, 2 mM DTT, 80 mM Potassium acetate, 200 \u03bcM dNTPs, 800 ng/\u03bcl gp32, 200 ng/\u03bcl uvsX, 60 ng/\u03bcl uvsY, 300 nM primers, 43 to 1400 ng/\u03bcl Bsu polymerase, 100 copies/\u03bcl genomic DNA, 120 minutes at 37\ufffd C. (D) LNA-modified oligonucleotides give little, if any, background when no target is present, but efficiently amplify bona fide product to high levels when reaction conditions are optimized. A polymerase concentration of 200 ng/\u03bcl Bsu polymerase was employed. Reactions were carried out with DNA primers pairs, or LNA primer pairs, in the presence or absence of target. A faint band of the expected size was found in the negative controls indicating a contamination problem. Nevertheless both primer pairs amplified efficiently in the presence of target, but in its absence the DNA pair gave significant noisy smear, while the LNA pair gave no other product than the slight contamination. This indicates that the LNA primer pair may be able to cleanly distinguish between the presence and absence of target in the sample, while the DNA primers generate primer-derived products in the absence of target. Amplification conditions were: 50 mM Tris.Cl pH 8.3, 90 mM Magnesium acetate, 2 mM DTT, 80 mM Potassium acetate, 200 \u03bcM dNTPs, 800 ng/\u03bcl gp32, 200 ng/\u03bcl uvsX, 60 ng/\u03bcl uvsY, 300 nM primers, 200 ng/\u03bcl Bsu polymerase, 50 copies/\u03bcl genomic DNA, 120 minutes at 37\ufffd C., 461794=Ferrari et al., J Mol Biol. 1994 Feb. 11; 236(1):106-23, 461979=Formosa T, Alberts B M. Cell. 1986 Dec. 5; 47(5):793-806. DNA synthesis dependant on genetic recombination: characterization of a reaction catalyzed by purified bacteriophage T4 proteins., 356636=Another major difference between uvsX and recA is that uvsX hydrolyses ATP to ADP plus phosphate, and to AMP plus pyrophosphate whereas recA and other recombinases do not (Formosa T, Alberts B M. J Biol Chem. 1986 May 5; 261(13):6107-18.). The biological significance of this difference is not known but the activity might affect RPA efficiency. For instance, the pitch of nucleoprotein filaments formed with ATP and ADP is different and the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP is associated with overall filament flexibility. It may be that AMP-bound uvsX can adopt a different pitch and possess a distinct flexibility., 265129=We have predicted a potentially stable reaction composition using E. coli recA protein in the presence of ATP and the E. coli single-stranded binding protein SSB, or the T4 uvsX protein in the presence of gp32. We suggested the presence of recO, recR, and possibly recF proteins (Bork, Cox and Inman EMBO J. 2001 Dec. 17; 20(24):7313-22), could lead to an environment in which pre-loaded recA filaments were stabilised, and in which recA could nucleate successfully onto SSB-bound oligonucleotides. A similar recombinase loading system has been described in other organisms including the recombination/replication/repair system of bacteriophage T4. The T4 recombinase uvsX can be loaded onto single-stranded DNA coated with the T4 single-stranded DNA binding protein gp32 by the action of a third component, the uvsY protein (Morrical and Alberts J Biol Chem. 1990 Sep. 5; 265(25):15096-103). Interestingly a principal role of this recombination system in vivo is to permit recombination-dependant DNA synthesis by assembling replication components at recombination intermediates such as D-loops (Formosa and Alberts Cell. 1986 Dec. 5; 47(5):793-806). This process is similar to what should happen in RPA driven from D-loops made by the invasion of synthetic oligonucleotides. In addition to interactions between the three components uvsX, uvsY, and gp32, there are also interactions between these components and the replication machinery such as the polymerase, clamp loader, primase/helicase, and dda helicase (Reddy, Weitzel and Von Hippel, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1993 Apr. 15; 90(8):3211-5, Hacker and Alberts, J Biol Chem. 1992 Oct. 15; 267(29):20674-81). Taken together these facts suggest that the components of the T4 recombination/replication machinery would perhaps be even more ideal for RPA than the E. coli equivalents., 473288=Wittwer C T, Hermann M., Moss A A, and Rasmussen R P.

The crowding agent may be at a concentration of between 1% to 12% by volume or 1% to 12% by weight of the reaction. While all PEGs are useful, preferred PEGs include PEG1450, PEG3000, PEG8000, PEG10000, PEG compound molecular weight 15000-to 20,000 (also known as Carbowax 20M), and a combination thereof., 470331=Spies, M., Kil, Y., Masui, R., Kato, R., Kujo, C., Ohshima, T., Kuramitsu, S. and Lanzov, V.

Eur J Biochem 267, 1125-37., 355461=In addition to their similarities, however, there are differences between recA and uvsX relevant to RPA and as additional components of recombination/replication machinery are used in RPA reactions organism-specific protein-protein interactions may have a significant effect on reaction efficiency. The nucleotide hydrolysis rate of uvsX is 10-20 times higher than that of recA, suggesting that it might perform recombination reactions at an accelerated rate (Formosa T, Alberts B M. J Biol Chem. 1986 May 5; 261(13):6107-18.). An increased hydrolysis rate could be beneficial for RPA reactions in several ways., 738962=1:50,000 dilution of SYBR-green I commercial stock (Molecular Probes), 197817=The recombinase may be uvsX, recA or a combination of both. The recombinase may also comprise a C terminal deletion of acidic residues to improve its activity. While any recombinase concentration disclosed in the specification may be used, preferred recombinase concentrations may be, for example, in the range of 0.2-12 \u03bcM, 0.2-1 \u03bcM, 1-4 \u03bcM, 4-6 \u03bcM, and 6-12 \u03bcM., 792140=Amplification reactions were phenol extracted, precipitated, and separated on a 16.5% denaturing Urea-PAGE gel. Separated products were transferred to nylon membrane and products were detected using a Streptavidin-HRP conjugate. As the 5\u2032 end of the probe was biotinylated, this permitted the detection of uncut, cut and elongated probes. (A) Detection of probes, free and processed. Note that in the presence of an RPA environment capable of amplifying the target fragment, the probe was elongated preferentially elongated. Also note that while significant elongation occurs in the absence of the added target for the J1/K2 primer pair (due we believe to contamination), when the J1/L2 primers pair is used this does not occur (a very faint band is, we believe, a sample cross-loading artifact). Consequently we deduce that probe cutting/elongation is a specific event. Furthermore the significant signals in the no-template J1/K2 samples suggests that the system is highly responsive to even very small numbers of targets, as is presumably arising from the carry-over contamination. In (C) is shown the results of a similar experiment in which the J1 and L2 primers were used in combination with the probe on either no target DNA, or on a sample with target DNA at 1000 copies per microliter (genomic DNA). Oligonucleotide concentrations are as follows: J1 and L2 at 240 nM, probe at just 12 nM, and \u02dc1000 ng per microliter of Nfo enzyme were used. Other conditions are as described for the experiment in part (B). Samples were removed at the indicated times and stopped. Samples were phenol extracted, precipitated, and run on a denaturing gel as already described, transferred to nylon membrane, and detected as described above. We note that cleavage/elongation products can be detected by 30 minutes even when the probe is as low as 12 nM. This suggests that the kinetics of Nfo action under these conditions is sufficiently fast to monitor reactions excellently in real-time., 472087=Webb, B. L., Cox, M. M. and Inman, R. B. (1995).

J Biol Chem. 1992 May 5; 267(13):9307-14, 473851=As shown herein, we have developed an in vitro DNA amplification system that couples recombinase-driven sequence targeting with strand-displacement synthesis. This permits DNA amplification without global thermal, chemical, or enzymatic template melting. Reactions are sensitive, specific and operate at 37\ufffd C. with no pre-treatment of sample DNA. As much as 1012-fold amplification is observed within 1-1\ufffd hours. Less than 10 copies of a given target DNA can be detected in a complex sample with a simple single-step reaction. This method is an ideal alternative to PCR for a variety of applications and will enable highly portable DNA diagnostic systems., 462982=Heyer, W. D. and Kolodner, R. D. (1989). Purification and characterization of a protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that binds tightly to single-stranded DNA and stimulates a cognate strand exchange protein. Biochemistry 28, 2856-62., 267016=In addition to the use of recombinase loading proteins, such as recO and recR, or uvsY, there are other ways to create an appropriate balance between recombinase activity and the activity of single-stranded DNA binding proteins. The DNA binding and/or cooperativity behaviour of recombinases and single-stranded DNA binding proteins can be modulated by mutation. In addition, recombinases from different sources have distinct properties (Eggler, Lusetti and Cox, J Biol Chem. 2003 May 2; 278(18):16389-96. Epub 2003 Feb. 20, Villemain et al., J Biol Chem. 2000 Oct. 6; 275(40):31496-504). This suggests that a range of recombinase and single-strand DNA binding protein activities could be explored. The use of mutated proteins or proteins from different species, in a set of optimisation experiments could lead to the identification of an optimal ratio of the competing recombinase and single-stranded binding activities. Ultimately the activities would be balanced such that DNA association/dissociation for the two DNA-binding species permits sufficient recombinase activity together with sufficient DNA melting activity of the single-strand DNA binding protein to perform its necessary functions also. In addition, reduction of noise due to mispriming may be achieved through the optimisation of such parameters as oligonucleotide sequence design, reaction buffer, the use of partly modified oligonucleotides, the use of part duplex oligonucleotides or the addition of other specific reaction components detailed below., 461700=Elias-Arnanz M, Salas M.

J Biochem (Tokyo) 90, 1033-45., 795793=There is a long-standing need for in vitro methods to amplify specific DNA sequences. Since the late 1980's the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method has principally met this need (R. K. Saiki et al., Science 239, 487-91 (Jan. 29, 1988)). The requirement for thermal cycling equipment, however, poses a significant barrier to the use of PCR outside of a laboratory setting. As described herein, we have developed a method called RPA, which obviates the need for thermal melting of template DNAs. RPA combines components of the bacteriophage T4 recombination/replication system in vitro under critical defined conditions to mediate the hybridisation of oligonucleotide primers to template DNAs. Specifically, the bacteriophage T4 recombinase uvsX, single-stranded DNA binding (SSB) protein gp32, and recombinase loading factor uvsY together with molecular crowding agents, allow high fidelity in vitro recombinase-mediated DNA targeting. When this targeting system is combined with strand displacement DNA synthesis mediated by enzymes of the E. coli or B. subtilis Pol I class, efficient exponential DNA amplification is achieved., 469833=Scheerhagen et al., J Biomol Struct Dyn. 1986 April; 3(5):887-98, 318360=We found, however, that if a crowding agent such as polyethylene glycol is included in the presence of gp32(N), subsequent invasion/extension occurs. One possibility is that under these conditions unstable intermediates are temporarily stabilised by gp32(N), such that elongation can occur. It is possible that polyethylene glycol acts to partly rescue the poor cooperativity of the compromised gp32(N) allowing it to stabilise these otherwise unstable intermediates. This conclusion is supported both by our data showing that N-terminally his-tagged gp32 is cooperatively attenuated, and the known capacity of crowding agents to enhance the effectiveness of interactions between molecules, thus partly making up for the poorer interaction between monomers. We initially believed that this experiment might be best explained by suggesting that recA filaments were more abundant in the presence of PEG, as previously reported elsewhere (Layery P E, Kowalczykowski S C. J Biol Chem. 1992 May 5; 267(13):9307-14), however we feel that this does not adequately account for the observed switch from a dead-end only one round of invasion to productive multiple rounds of invasion/extension., 195099=Naturally, any derivatives and functional analogs of the recombinase agent above may also function itself as a recombinase agent and these derivatives and analogs are also contemplated as embodiments of the invention. For example, a small peptide from recA, which has been shown to retain some aspects of the recombination properties of recA, may be used. This peptide comprises residues 193 to 212 of E. coli recA and can mediate pairing of single stranded oligos (Oleg N. Voloshin, Lijang Wang, R. Daniel Camerini-Otero, Homologous DNA pairing Promoted by a 20-amino Acid Peptide Derived from RecA. Science Vol. 272 10 May 1996)., 462836=Heid C A, Stevens J, Livak K J, Williams P M. Real time quantitative PCR. Genome Res. 1996 October; 6(10):986-94., 277243=In an embodiment, steps two and three are repeated at least 5 times. Preferably, it is repeated at least 10 times. More preferably, it is repeated at least 20 times, such as at least 30 times. Most preferably, the two steps are repeated at least 50 times. For multiple repetitions of the amplification step (e.g., step 2 and 3) a RPA of the invention is preferably started with a primer to target nucleic acid ration of at least 100 to 1, preferably at least 300 to 1, and most preferably at least 1000 to 1. That is, there are at least 100, 300 or 1000 copies of the primer per copy of a target nucleic acid., 325155=There is little published evidence to support how effectively recA, or other recombinases, might be used with relatively the short synthetic oligonucleotide primers used for RPA. It is also unclear whether a stable reaction environment can be generated in which such short DNA oligonucleotides remain actively loaded with recombinase. Most studies performed with recA utilise comparatively large substrates such as single-stranded and double-stranded forms of the bacteriophage M13 genome (many thousands of residues) as donor and acceptor DNAs. Experimental assays for recombinase activity often consist of the formation of intermediate, or completed, recombination events measured by electrophoretic migration or electron microscopy (Harris L D, Griffith J. J Biol Chem. 1987 Jul. 5; 262(19):9285-92). A few experiments have been described using short oligonucleotides. Sequences as short as 15 nucleotides have been shown to assemble functional homology-searching complexes with recA in the presence of the non-hydrolysable cofactor analogue ATP-\u03b3-S, but investigations combining short oligonucleotides and ATP are ambiguous (Hsieh P, Camerini-Otero C S, Camerini-Otero R D. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1992 Jul. 15; 89(14):6492-6). The homology-searching function of recombinases is not necessarily sufficient to complete strand exchange and to release from the invasion complex to allow access by other DNA metabolising proteins such as polymerases. Indeed, studies have shown that recA shows transitions between low ATP hydrolysis rate (a useful indicator of combined DNA binding activity and functional recombinase activity) and high hydrolysis rate at oligonucleotide lengths substantially longer than the 15 nucleotides required for searching. Furthermore the type of nucleotide cofactor seems to influence on the length at which such hydrolysis transitions occur (Katz F S, Bryant F R. Biochemistry. 2001 Sep. 18; 40(37):11082-9). The bacteriophage T4 recombinase uvsX has also been shown to exhibit variable properties on short oligonucleotides, and shows some sensitivity to the base composition (Formosa T, Alberts B M. J Biol Chem. 1986 May 5; 261(13):6107-18). Despite this, both uvsX and recA are capable of performing recombination events with single-stranded substrates of roughly 30 base pairs or more in the presence of hydrolysable nucleotides like ATP, suggesting that the use of such short synthetic targeting oligonucleotides is reasonable (Salinas F, Jiang H, Kodadek T. J Biol Chem. 1995 Mar. 10; 270(10):5181-6; Formosa T, Alberts B M. J Biol Chem. 1986 May 5; 261(13):6107-18)., 774068=1:50,000 dilution from stock of SYBR green (Molecular probes), 729239=Arrangement of the primers ApoB4 and Apo300 (SEQ IDs 20 and 21 respectively) which flank a fragment of the human Apolipoprotein B locus. (B) SYBR gold can be included in RPA reactions at dilutions of 1:50,000 or greater without complete inhibition of the reaction. Reactions were composed of 50 mM Tris pH 8.4, 80 mM Potassium acetate, 200 \u03bcM dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 50 ng/\u03bcl creatine kinase, 1.5 mM ATP, 10 mM Magnesium acetate, 2 mM DTT, 30 mM phosphocreatine, 300 nM ApoB4 primer, 300 nM ApoB300 primer, 5% Carbowax 20M, 360 ng/\u03bcl gp32, 86 ng/\u03bcl uvsX, 15 ng/\u03bcl uvsY, 35 ng/\u03bcl Bsu polymerase. SYBR gold at the indicated dilution was included in the reaction. (C)RPA reactions were established in a 96-well plate, each with a final volume of 50 \u03bcl. A mastermix of components lacking only the target DNA and the SYBR gold dye was established on ice. Five different dilutions of SYBR gold were tested, with final dilutions from stock of 1:50,000, 1:60,000, 1:70,000, 1:80,000, and 1:100,000. For each dilution starting target copy densities of 2 and 20 copies per microliter were investigated (human genomic DNA diluted in TE to the expected copy density). Once reactions had been thoroughly mixed on ice, the plate was transferred to the pre-warmed plate (37\ufffd C.) of a BIO-TEK FLX 800 fluorescent microplate reader. Readings were collected every 1 minute, and 300 ng of human genomic DNA diluted in 50 \u03bcl of water was used as a sensitivity standard for the device. Data was transferred to Microsoft Excel and relative fluorescence (arbitrary) was plotted against incubation time for each reaction. (D) An experiment was established as in (C) except that SYBR green rather than SYBR gold was assayed., 359426=Finally uvsX is likely to behave better with gp32, which we find to be an optimal single-stranded DNA binding protein, because they have evolved to function in concert and may have relevant interactions. Indeed uvsX and other components of the bacteriophage T4 recombination dependant replication machinery, such as the dda helicase, have known protein-protein interactions that may useful for establishing an optimal RPA reaction (Hacker K J, Alberts B M. J Biol Chem. 1992 Oct. 15; 267(29):20674-81)., 801533=There are other ways the recombinase/single-stranded primer DNA interaction could be stabilised. For example, another bacteriophage T4 protein called uvsY is known to aid loading of uvsX onto gp32-coated DNA (L. D. Harris, J. D. Griffith, J Mol Biol 206, 19-27 (Mar. 5, 1989)). In addition, molecular crowding agents are also known to facilitate loading and stabilisation of the E. coli recA recombinase protein (P. E. Layery, S. C. Kowalczykowski, J Biol Chem 267, 9307-14 (May 5, 1992)). We therefore tested whether uvsY and molecular crowding agents might alleviate the unfavourable competition between uvsX and gp32 in a dynamic, ATP-dependent system., 154913=Also in this invention we disclose approaches to control, and potentially synchronise aspects of, RPA reactions. In current configurations of RPA there is no temporal separation between the DNA targeting and DNA synthesis phases. For RPA, it is difficult to ensure that all reactions in RPA are initiated at exactly the same moment unless a rate-limiting reagent is supplied to all samples simultaneously, or the reactions are assembled at a non-permissive temperature. We suggest approaches by which RPA reactions may be initiated, and individual \u2018rounds\u2019 of priming activity may be regulated, by limiting invasion to well-spaced short bursts. Such approaches to limit recombinase activity to short limited bursts could improve amplification. One way to control DNA invasion in RPA may be by regulating the concentration of free ATP. In the absence of sufficient ATP, or an excess of ADP, recombinase/DNA filaments disassemble and recombination halts. Caged ATP does not support recA loading, but subsequently uncaged material does [Butler B C, Hanchett R H, Rafailov H, MacDonald G (2002) Investigating Structural Changes Induced By Nucleotide Binding to RecA Using Difference FTIR. Biophys J 82(4): 2198-2210]. Thus the use of caged ATP analogues in RPA reactions, which can be deprotected in pulses by light thus permitting bursts of recombinase activity, should be an effective means to control the invasion phase of an RPA reaction. Alternatively ATP concentration could be cyclically controlled by alternative methods such as periodic addition of ATP to the reaction from an external source, or by establishing a biochemical oscillator capable of generating periodic increases of ATP in the reaction., 206863=The target nucleic acid may be of any concentration such as less than 10,000 copies, less than 1000 copies, less than 100 copies, less than 10 copies or 1 copy in a reaction. A reaction volume may be 5 \u03bcl, 10 \u03bcl, 20 \u03bcl, 30 \u03bcl, 50 \u03bcl, 75 \u03bcl, 100 \u03bcl, 300 \u03bcl, 1 ml, 3 ml, 10 ml, 30 ml, 50 ml or 100 ml., 787220=1000 copies/\u03bcl B. subtilis genomic DNA, or water controls as indicated, 466403=Mazin, A.

Biophys J 82(4): 2198-2210]. Following photolysis, however, released ATP enables recombinase function. All prokaryotic recombinases so far studied are direct homologues of the recA protein with primary sequence homology, and structural homology. Moreover, all recA homologues studied, including the eukaryotic homologues, require binding to ATP to enable recombinase function. We expect that similar phenomena with therefore be mediated with T4 uvsX and other recombinases accordingly., 398218=Currently real-time analysis of DNA accumulation is most widely employed in combination with the PCR. PCR shows exponential amplification of DNA up to several cycles after reaching a product detection threshold and can be implemented using relatively inexpensive optics when various fluorescence-based sensors are used. Consequently assessing the cycle number a given sample crosses the detectability threshold, in combination with equivalent results from control samples, permits assignment of the number of copies present in anonymous samples. A number of sensor approaches have been described, and many are currently employed. Fluorescent minor groove binding dyes can be employed which develop strong fluorescence once bound to DNA. Examples of such dyes include SYBR gold and SYBR green (Wittwer et al. [1]). Additional other approaches have been successfully implemented, and these gain from adding target specificity to the sensing permitting greater sensitivity and specificity, particularly at low target levels in the initial sample. One simple format comprises two oligonucleotide primers recognising adjacent internal sequences of the amplicon, each labelled with a fluorophore. If the target is present the two fluorophores become closely situated and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) occurs, which can be detected with suitable excitation and emission filters (Wittwer et al. 1997 [2]). Other preferred systems employ probes combining the presence of both a fluorophore and a quencher. For some methods hybridisation to the target amplicon causes separation of hairpin-associated fluorophore and quencher and hence an increase in fluorescence. In another method hybridisation of the probe is assessed via the action of an oncoming polymerase possessing a 5\u2032-3\u2032 exonuclease which attacks the probe and leads to permanent separation of the fluorophore and quencher (so called \u2018Taqman\u2019 probes) [Heid C A, Stevens J, Livak K J, Williams P M., Real time quantitative PCR. Genome Res. (1996) 6:986-94]. Implementation of these approaches and others is widely documented., 469210=Reddy, Weitzel and Von Hippel, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1993 Apr. 15; 90(8):3211-5, 247601=In RPA, replication is initiated at two distant sites and the replication forks are oriented toward each other. As replication forks converge the two original template strands will dissociate from one another as they become separated entirely both behind, and in front, of each fork. The leading strand core of each fork will then complete synthesis, the remaining RNA primers will be processed, and the final products will be two double-stranded molecules. We can reasonably expect to amplify DNA's on the order of several Megabases (Mb) by such an approach. In this disclosure, megabase also encompasses megabasepairs. Based on the known synthetic rate of the PolIII holoenzyme we can expect the replication forks to proceed at a rate of approximately 1 Mb/1000 seconds, i.e., approximately 15 to 20 minutes per cycle for a I Mb fragment., 298495=One method of detecting a genotype is to detect the distance between a primer pair in an RPA reaction. The distance between a primer pair is reflected by the size of the amplified sequence. In that method, the two primers are selected such that it spans a target region such as, for example, a gene. Then RPA is performed using the primer pair and the RPA product is analyzed. The analysis may involve determining the size or sequence of the amplified product. Methods of determining the size of a DNA sequence, including at least techniques such as agarose gels, PAGE gels, mass spectroscopy, pulsed field gels, gene chips, sucrose sedimentation and the like are known. There are many DNA sequencing methods and their variants, such as the Sanger sequencing using dideoxy termination and denaturing gel electrophoresis (Sanger, F., Nichlen, S. & Coulson, A. R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75, 5463-5467 (1977)), Maxam-Gilber sequencing using chemical cleavage and denaturing gel electrophoresis (Maxam, A. M. & Gilbert, W. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 74, 560-564 (1977)), pyrosequencing detection pyrophosphate (PPi) released during the DNA polymerase reaction (Ronaghi, M., Uhlen, M. & Nyren, P. Science 281, 363, 365 (1998)), and sequencing by hybridization (SBH) using oligonucleotides (Lysov, I., Florent'ev, V. L., Khorlin, A. A., Khrapko, K. R. & Shik, V. V.

Nucleic Acids Res 28, 2324-32., 375243=Analysis of How Primer Noise May Originate, 365913=In what manner PEG compound (carbowax 20M) achieves such a significant stimulatory effect is mysterious. Kinetic models of the manner in which volume exclusion may affect reaction rates would place significant emphasis on the molecular weights of the substrates and enzymes under study in comparison to the crowding component. However the next-most effective agent that we tested, PEG 1450, was also the smallest and stimulation by polyethylene glycols intermediate between PEG1450 and PEG compound were less effective. Consequently we suspect that properties additional to simply average chain length are critical to the effects of these agents. For example specific phase transitions may occur at variant temperatures for different PEGs. It is also known that the alcohol groups of PEGs can lead to additional interactions, such as with proteins, or influencing the ionic environment. We note (data not shown) that the addition of 5% PEG compound (while developing a pH below 7.0 during storage at room temperature) to Tris-buffered solutions used in RPA causes a sharp rise in pH., 411776=The experiments performed here suggest that kinetic RPA reactions can be used to decrease the time taken to assess the presence of target DNA in samples compared to later gel electrophoresis. The experimental set-up we have used here is far from ideal as the 96-well plates used are made of thick plastic, and the heated plate on the fluorometer is not in direct contact with the sample wells. We estimate that it takes up to 5 minutes for a 50 \u03bcl volume reaction to attain temperature under these conditions, and perhaps 8 minutes for a 100 \u03bcl volume. In an optimised device these long lag times would not exist. Consequently we estimate that for a clinically relevant quantity of human DNA (say 1000-3000 copies, \u02dc3 ng-9 ng) amplification could be assessed readily in roughly 30 minutes with the appropriate equipment using typical conditions shown here. Despite the limitations of these experiments using 96-well plates and a conventional fluorometer, these pilot experiments are highly encouraging and indicate that kinetic monitoring of RPA reactions offers a tractable approach to quantification, and that this is quantification may be practically implemented to assess DNA levels over at least 5 orders of magnitude., 471539=Vester B, Wengel J., Biochemistry. 2004 Oct. 26; 43(42):13233-41Villemain, et al.
