The \u201cstripping units\u201d can be multifunctional processing capsules which can perform cleaning, stripping, bevel etching, rinsing and drying. In one embodiment, the stripping unit can include a rotor motor connected to a microelectronic workpiece housing to rotate the housing. The microelectronic workpiece housing can define an at least partially closed processing chamber therein in which one or more processing fluids are distributed across at least one face of the microelectronic workpiece, for example, by centrifugal forces generated during rotation of the housing.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{177838=The upper chamber wall A1120 has an inlet A1122 for processing fluids, which may be liquid, vaporous, or gaseous, and the lower chamber wall A1140 has an inlet A1142 for such fluids, which for a given application may be similar fluids or different fluids. The head A1200 mounts an upper nozzle A1210, which extends axially through the sleeve A1222 so as not to interfere with the rotation of the sleeve A1222. The upper nozzle A1210 directs streams of processing fluids downwardly through the inlet A1122 of the upper chamber wall A1120., 259335=Table 1 below sets forth exemplary data corresponding to a test run in which a 200 mm wafer is plated with copper in a multiple anode system using a nominally 2000 \u212b thick initial copper seed-layer. Identical currents of 1.12 Amps (for 3 minutes) were provided to all four anodes A1-A4. The resulting thickness at five radial locations was then measured and is recorded in the second column of Table 1. The 3 sigma uniformity of the wafer is 9.4% using a 49 point contour map. Target thickness were then provided and are set forth in column 3 of Table 1. In this example, because a flat coating is desired, the target thickness is the same at each radial position. The thickness errors (processed errors) between the plated film and the target thickness were then calculated and are provided in the last column of Table 1. These calculated thickness errors are used by the optimizer as a source of feedback control., 187296=The upper chamber wall B2120 includes an array of similar outlets B2124, which are spaced similarly at uniform angular spacings around the vertical axis A. In the disclosed embodiment, thirty-six such outlets B2124 are employed. Each outlet B2124 is spaced outwardly from the vertical axis A by a comparatively larger radial distance and is spaced inwardly from the outer perimeter B16 of a wafer B10 supported in the processing position by a comparatively smaller radial distance, such as a distance of approximately 1.5 millimeters., 382723=This further embodiment employs a different structure for providing fluid flow to the anodes C1015, C1020, C1025 and C1030. More particularly, the further embodiment employs an inlet member C2010 that serves as an inlet for the supply and distribution of the processing fluid to the anode chamber housings C1017, 1022, 1027 and 1032., 471195=During the cooling portion of the annealing process, the first heat sink E1060 can be raised to engage the heat source E1040 and cool both the heat source E1040 and the microelectronic workpiece W by conduction. Accordingly, the first heat sink E1060 can be coupled to a heat sink actuator E1061 that moves the first heat sink E1060 upwardly into engagement with the heat source E1040. In one embodiment, the heat sink actuator E1061 can include an air-driven bellows, generally similar to the lid actuator E1021 discussed above. Alternatively, the heat sink actuator E1061 can have other configurations that move the first heat sink E1060 upwardly into engagement with the heat source E1040 and downwardly out of engagement with the heat source E1040., 186649=The upper chamber wall B2120 has an inlet B2122 for processing fluids, which may be liquid, vaporous, or gaseous, and the lower chamber wall B2140 has an inlet B2142 for such fluids, which for a given application may be similar fluids or different fluids. The head B2200 mounts an upper nozzle B2210, which extends axially through the sleeve B2222 so as not to interfere with the rotation of the sleeve B2222. The upper nozzle B2210 directs streams of processing fluids downwardly through the inlet B2122 of the upper chamber wall B2120., 190109=As a significant example of one such process, the reactor B2100 can be used with control of the respective pressures of processing fluids entering the respective inlets B2122, B2142, to carry out a process in which a processing fluid is allowed to contact a first side of the workpiece, the peripheral edge of the workpiece, and a peripheral region of the opposite side of the workpiece. Such fluid flow/contact can also be viewed as a manner of excluding a processing fluid that is applied to the opposite side from a peripheral region of that side. In accordance with one embodiment of such a process, a thin film of material is etched from the first side, peripheral edge of the workpiece, and peripheral region of the opposite side of the workpiece., 180154=As compared to other types of reactors, the reactor A1100 is particularly suitable for executing a range of unique microfabrication processes. For example, reactor A1100 is particularly suited to execute a process such as the one set forth herein that requires complete contact of a processing fluid at a first side of a workpiece and at only a peripheral margin portion of the second side thereof. Such processes may be realized because processing fluids entering the inlet A1142 of the lower chamber wall A1140 can act on the lower side A1014 of a supported wafer A1010, on the outer periphery A1016 of the supported wafer A1010, and on an outer margin A1018 of the upper side A1012 of the supported wafer A10 before reaching the outlets A1124, and because processing fluids entering the inlet A1122 of the upper chamber wall A120 can act on the upper side A1012 of the supported wafer A1010, except for the outer margin A1018 of the upper side A1012, before reaching the outlets A1124., 211039=The reactor C20 also includes an electrode in the processing container 39 to contact the electrochemical processing fluid (e.g., the electroplating fluid) as it flows through the reactor C20. In the embodiment of FIG. C3, the reactor C20 includes an electrode assembly C50 having a base member C52 through which a plurality of fluid flow apertures C54 extend. The fluid flow apertures C54 assist in disbursing the electroplating fluid flow entering inlet C42 so that the flow of electroplating fluid at the surface of microelectronic workpiece C25 is less localized and has a desired radial distribution. The electrode assembly C50 also includes an electrode array C56 that can comprise a plurality of individual electrodes C58 supported by the base member C52. The electrode array 56 can have several configurations, including those in which electrodes are disposed at different distances from the microelectronic workpiece. The particular physical configuration that is utilized in a given reactor can depend on the particular type and shape of the microelectronic workpiece C25. In the illustrated embodiment, the microelectronic workpiece C25 is a disk-shaped semiconductor wafer. Accordingly, the present inventors have found that the individual electrodes C58 may be formed as rings of different diameters and that they may be arranged concentrically in alignment with the center of microelectronic workpiece C25. It will be recognized, however, that grid arrays or other electrode array configurations may also be employed without departing from the scope of the present invention. One suitable configuration of the reactor base C35 and electrode array C56 is disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 09/804,696, filed Mar. 12, 2001, while another suitable configuration is disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 09/804,697, filed Mar. 12, 2001, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference., 105713=Numerous processing tools have been developed to implement the foregoing processing operations. These tools take on different configurations depending on the type of microelectronic workpiece used in the fabrication process and the process or processes executed by the tool. An exemplary tool embodiment is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/991,062, filed Dec. 15, 1997, entitled \u201cSemiconductor Processing Apparatus Having Lift and Tilt Mechanism.\u201d, 176509=The reactor A1100 can have an upper chamber member that includes an upper chamber wall A1120 and a lower chamber member that includes a lower chamber wall A1140. These walls A1120, A1140 can be arranged to open so as to permit a wafer A1010 to be loaded into the reactor A1100 for processing, by a loading and unloading mechanism (not shown) that, for example, may be in the form of a robot having an end effector. These walls A1120, A1140 can be arranged to close so as to define a capsule A1160 supporting a wafer A1010 in a processing position, between these walls A1120, A1140., 479829=An advantage of an embodiment of the apparatus E1000 described above with reference to FIG. E9 is that it can be of modular construction. Accordingly, any number of chambers E1003 can be stacked, one above the other, to reduce the footprint occupied by the chambers. The chambers can also be integrated as they are stacked so that the bottom portion of an upper chamber defines the top portion of the chamber below. Another feature of an embodiment of the apparatus E1000 described above with reference to FIG. E9 is that the heat source E1040 and the second heat sink E1050 do not move relative to the rest of the apparatus. Instead, the first heat sink E1060 and the microelectronic workpiece W move relative to the heat source E1040 to transfer heat to and from the microelectronic workpiece W. An advantage of this feature is that the number of movable couplings for providing electrical power, purge fluid communication and vacuum communication to moving parts can be reduced by comparison with some conventional arrangements. Still further features of an embodiment of the apparatus E1000 are that the heat source E1040 has a low thermal mass and is positioned above the heat sinks E1050, E1060. Accordingly, the heat source (and therefore the workpiece W) can cool relatively quickly, and any gas heated by the heat source E1040 will tend to rise away from (rather than toward) the heat sinks E1050, E1060. An advantage of this arrangement is that the workpiece can heat and cool quickly, increasing the throughput of the apparatus relative to conventional devices., 175799=As shown in FIGS. A3 and A4, a reactor A1100 for processing a microelectronic workpiece, such as a silicon wafer A1010 having an upper side A1012, a lower side A1014, and an outer, circular perimeter A1016, in a micro-environment constitutes a platform for the practice of a process in accordance with an aspect of this invention. For certain applications, the upper side A1012 is the front side, which may be otherwise called the device side, and the lower side A1014 is the back side, which may be otherwise called the non-device side. However, for other applications, the silicon wafer A1010 is inverted., 380703=Of further note, unlike the foregoing embodiment, element C1210 is a securement that is formed from a dielectric material. The securement C1210 is used to clamp a plurality of the structures forming reactor base C35 together. Although securement 1210 may be formed from a conductive material so that it may function as an anode, the innermost anode seen by the microelectronic workpiece under process is preferably a virtual anode corresponding to the interior most anode C1015., 381249=FIGS. C11 and C12 illustrate computer simulations of fluid flow velocity contours of a reactor constructed in accordance with the embodiment shown in FIGS. C13 through C15. In this embodiment, all of the anodes of the reactor base may be isolated from a flow of fluid through the anode chamber housings. To this end, FIG. C11 illustrates the fluid flow velocity contours that occur when a flow of electroplating solution is provided through each of the anode chamber housings, while FIG. C12 illustrates the fluid flow velocity contours that occur when there is no flow of electroplating solution provided through the anode chamber housings past the anodes. This latter condition can be accomplished in the reactor of by turning off the flow the flow from the second fluid flow inlet (described below) and may likewise be accomplished in the reactor of FIGS. C9 and 10 by turning of the fluid flow through inlet C1060. Such a condition may be desirable in those instances in which a flow of electroplating solution across the surface of the anodes is found to significantly reduce the organic additive concentration of the solution., 476019=The microelectronic workpiece W is then moved (with the applied material side facing upward in one embodiment) into the open chamber by a robotic transfer mechanism. The transfer mechanism rests the microelectronic workpiece W on the workpiece supports E1070 and withdraws. The lid E1020 then moves downwardly to the closed position and as it does so, engages the workpiece supports E1070 and moves them downwardly until the workpiece W engages the heat source E1040. A vacuum is applied to the vacuum apertures E1041 via the vacuum port E1042 to draw the workpiece W into close thermal engagement with the heat source E1040. The vacuum can be applied before, during or after the lid closing operation. The purge fluid to the chamber volume E1008 is then replaced with a flow of process gas (for example, 1 to 10 liters per minute of N2, Ar, H2 or He2). When the gas is supplied at more than one flow rate, the apparatus E1000 can include a mass flow controller and/or a multi-port valved manifold to selectively control the flow of gas into the chamber volume E1008., 276621=2. If the average seed-layer thickness changes significantly, the resistance of the seed-layer will change resulting in a modified current density distribution across the wafer and altered film uniformity. For example, if the seed layer decreases from 2000 \u212b to 1000 \u212b, the final film will not only be thinner (because the initial film is thinner) but it will also be relatively thicker at the outer edge due to the higher resistivity of the 1000 \u212b seed-layer compared to the 2000 \u212b seed-layer (assuming an edge contact)., 387134=The contact assembly may also include one or more structures that provide a barrier, individually or in cooperation with other structures, that separates the contact/contacts C85, the peripheral edge portions and backside of the microelectronic workpiece C25 from the plating solution. This prevents the plating of metal onto the individual contacts and, further, assists in preventing any exposed portions of the barrier layer near the edge of the microelectronic workpiece C25 from being exposed to the electroplating environment. As a result, plating of the barrier layer and the appertaining potential for contamination due to flaking of any loosely adhered electroplated material is substantially limited. Exemplary contact assemblies suitable for use in the present system are illustrated in U.S. Ser. No. 09/113,723, while Jul. 10, 1998, entitled \u201cPLATING APPARATUS WITH PLATING CONTACT WITH PERIPHERAL SEAL MEMBER\u201d, which is hereby incorporated by reference., 424720=An example of an embodiment of the seed layer enhancement unit 232 is described in \u201cApparatus And Method For Electrolytically Depositing Copper On A Semiconductor Workpiece\u201d, PCT/US99/06306, filed Mar. 22, 1999 and herein incorporated by reference. The seed layer enhancement unit 232 can be embodied as an adjustable plating reactor as described in \u201cWorkpiece Processor Having Processing Chamber With Improved Processing Fluid Flow\u201d, PCT/US00/10210 filed Apr. 13, 2000 or \u201cSystem For Electrochemically Processing A Workpiece\u201d, PCT/US00/10120 filed Apr. 13, 2000 herein incorporated by reference., 465150=In one embodiment, the support E1002 of the apparatus E1000 can include a frame defined by a plurality of columns E1004 (two of which are visible in FIG. E9), each having a receiving channel E1005. The chambers E1003 can be fixedly attached to the columns E1004 by inserting tabs E1006 extending outwardly from the base E1010 of each chamber E1003 into the corresponding channels E1005 and fastening the tabs E1006 to the columns E1004. Accordingly, the chambers E1003 can remain fixed while a transfer mechanism E620 moves in the vertical direction to selectively place a single microelectronic workpiece W in either the upper chamber E1003 a or the lower chamber E1003 b. Alternatively, the chambers E1003 can be coupled either individually or together to one or more actuators E1007 to move the chambers E1003 vertically in addition to or in lieu of moving the transfer mechanism E620 in the vertical direction., 378775=The interstitial region between the rims of concentrically adjacent cups effectively defines the size and shape of each of a plurality of virtual anodes, each virtual anode being respectively associated with a corresponding anode disposed in its respective anode chamber housing. The size and shape of each virtual anode that is seen by the microelectronic workpiece under process is generally independent of the size and shape of the corresponding actual anode. As such, consumable anodes that vary in size and shape over time as they are used can be employed for anodes C1015, C1020, C1025 and C1030 without a corresponding change in the overall anode configuration is seen by the microelectronic workpiece under process. Further, given the deceleration experienced by the fluid flow as it proceeds vertically through flow regions C1205, a high fluid flow velocity may be introduced across the vertical surfaces of the anodes C1015, C1020, C1025 and C1030 in the anode chamber housings C1022, C1027 and C1032 while concurrently producing a very uniform fluid flow pattern radially across the surface of the microelectronic workpiece under process. Such a high fluid flow velocity across the vertical surfaces of the anodes C1015, C1020, C1025 and C1030, as noted above, is desirable when using certain electrochemical electroplating solutions, such as electroplating fluids available from Atotech. Further, such high fluid flow velocities may be used to assist in removing some of the gas bubbles that form at the surface of the anodes, particularly inert anodes. To this end, each of the anode chamber housings C1017, C1022, C1027 and C1032 may be provided with one or more gas outlets (not illustrated) at the upper portion thereof to vent such gases., 467231=The lid E1020 of each chamber E1003 can be coupled to a lid actuator E1021 to move downwardly from an open position (shown in FIG. E9) to a closed position. The lid actuator E1021 of the upper chamber E1003 a can be attached to the cover E1030, and the lid actuator E1021 of the lower chamber E1003 b can be attached to the base E1010 of the upper chamber E1003 a. Each lid actuator E1021 can include an air-activated bellows that moves the lid E1020 downwardly when inflated. In one aspect of this embodiment, each bellows can extend circumferentially for 360\ufffd to form a closed circle. Alternatively, a plurality of bellows or other actuators can be disposed at spaced-apart circumferential locations around the lid E1020. In either embodiment, one or more springs (not shown) can return the lid E1020 to the open (upper) position when the air pressure within the bellows is released., 177214=The reactor A1010, which defines a vertical axis A, can have a head A1200 containing a rotor A1210, which mounts the upper chamber wall A1120, and mounting a motor A1220 for rotating the rotor A1210 and the upper and lower chamber walls A1120, A1140, when closed, around the vertical axis A, conjointly with a wafer A1010 supported in the processing position. The head A1200 is arranged to be raised for opening these walls A1120, A1140, and to be lowered for closing these walls A1120, A1140., 192220=Based on the description of the foregoing process, it will be recognized that other layers and/or materials may be selectively etched, cleaned, deposited, protected, etc., based on selective contact of a processing fluid with the outer margin and/or opposing side of the workpiece. For example, oxide may be removed from the opposite side and outer margin of the first side of a workpiece through selective contact with an oxide etchant, such as hydrofluoric acid. Similarly, the oxide etchant may be controlled in the reactor so that it contacts all of the front side of the workpiece except for the outer margin thereby leaving the oxide at the outer margin intact. It will also be recognized that removal of the outlets B2124 allows the reactor B2100 to be used for processes in which selective outer margin inclusion or exclusion is unnecessary or otherwise undesirable., 376320=In accordance with the disclosed embodiment, fluid flow to and through the three outer most chamber housings C1022, C1027 and C1032 is provided from an inlet C1060 that is separate from inlet C515, which supplies the fluid flow through an innermost chamber housing C1017. As shown, fluid inlet C515 provides electroplating solution to a manifold C1065 having a plurality of slots C1070 disposed in its exterior wall. Slots C1070 are in fluid communication with a plenum C1075 that includes a plurality of openings C1080 through which the electroplating solution respectively enters the three anode chamber housings C1022, C1027 and C1032. Fluid entering the anode chamber housings C1017, C1022, C1027 and C1032 flows over at least one vertical surface and, preferably, both vertical surfaces of the respective anode C1015, C1020, C1025 and C1030., 477222=The heat source E1040 is then activated to heat the microelectronic workpiece W to a selected temperature for a selected period of time. For example, when the microelectronic workpiece W includes a copper layer, the workpiece W can be heated to a temperature in the range of from about 210 degrees Celsius to 290 degrees Celsius for a period of from about 30 seconds to about 90 seconds. In one specific example, the copper layer can be heated to about 250 degrees Celsius for about 60 seconds. Accordingly, the copper layer can be annealed such that the grain structure of the layer changes (e.g., the size of the grains forming the layer can increase). In other embodiments, the workpiece W can be heated to other temperatures for other periods of time depending on the chemical composition of the material targeted by the process, and by the result expected to be achieved by the process. The increase in temperature from the idle temperature can begin before, during or after the lid closing operation. The increase in temperature from the idle temperature to the target process temperature can be controlled using a closed-loop temperature sensor feedback control, such as a proportional integral control, a proportional integral derivative control or a multi-variable temperature control., 150350=The tool 300 can also include a microelectronic workpiece pre-aligner (not shown). The pre-aligner is described in \u201cSemiconductor Processing Apparatus Having Lift And Tilt Mechanism\u201d, U.S. Ser. No. 08/991,062 filed Dec. 15, 1997, incorporated herein in its entirety by reference, and is used to rotationally align microelectronic workpieces initially for precise processing. This can be significant when the metrology unit is used to measure precise points in patterned film layers, e.g., when accurate positioning of the microelectronic workpiece is important to obtain an accurate reading., 388774=The system of FIG. C15 includes a plurality of processing stations C1610. Preferably, these processing stations include one or more rinsing/drying stations and one or more electroplating stations (including one or more electroplating reactors such as the one above), although further immersion-chemical processing stations constructed in accordance with the present invention may also be employed. The system can also include a thermal processing station, such as at C1615, that includes at least one thermal reactor that is adapted for rapid thermal processing (RTP), and can further include a metrology station, as discussed above., 466258=In a further aspect of this embodiment, the chambers E1003 can have a modular construction. For example, the lid E1020 of the lower chamber E1003 b can depend from and can be integrated with the base E1010 of the upper chamber E1003 a. The lid E1020 of the upper chamber E1003 a can be supported by a cover E1030. Accordingly, any number of chambers E1003 can be stacked one above the other in a manner that reduces the total number of components of the apparatus E1000 by integrating features of one chamber with those of the chamber above. This arrangement can also reduce the footprint required for multiple chambers. At the same time, this arrangement provides the flexibility of a modular construction. In other embodiments, the apparatus E1000 can have other modular arrangements, for example, with the chambers positioned side by side., 383152=With reference to FIGS. C13 and C14, the inlet member C2010 includes a hollow stem C2015 that may be used to provide a flow of electroplating fluid. The hollow stem C2015 terminates at a stepped hub C2020. Stepped hub C2020 includes a plurality of steps C2025 that each include a groove dimensioned to receive and support a corresponding wall of the anode chamber housings. Processing fluid is directed into the anode chamber housings through a plurality of channels C2030 that proceed from a manifold area into the respective anode chamber housing., 463132=FIG. E9 is a partially schematic, partially cut-away, side isometric view of an apparatus E1000 for thermally processing microelectronic workpieces W in accordance with another embodiment of the invention. In one aspect of this embodiment, the apparatus E1000 includes two thermal processing chambers E1003 (shown as an upper chamber E1003 a and a lower chamber E1003 b) supported by an apparatus support E1002. Each chamber E1003 can have a base E1010 and lid E1020 that moves toward and away from the base E1010 to close and open the chamber E1003. The workpiece W can be supported within the chamber E1003 on a plurality of workpiece supports E1070. In one aspect of this embodiment, the apparatus E1000 can anneal a selected material (such as copper or another metal) of the workpiece W. Alternatively, the apparatus E1000 can perform other elevated temperature processes, as described in greater detail below. When the apparatus E1000 both heats and cools the workpiece W, the supports E1070 can lower the workpiece W into engagement with a heat source E1040 during a heating phase of the process. During a cooling phase of the process, a first heat sink E1060 can rise to engage an opposite surface of the heat source E1040 to cool both the heat source E1040 and the workpiece W. After the cooling phase, the first heat sink E1060 can descend to engage a second heat sink E1050 where the first heat sink E1060 is cooled in preparation for another cycle. The lid E1020 can then move away from the base E1010 and the workpiece W can be removed. In a preferred aspect of this embodiment, the heat source E1040 is positioned between the workpiece W and the first heat sink E1060, with the first heat sink E1060 positioned beneath the heat source E1040., 193209=The electroplating (or other electrical or non-electrical) deposition units 240, 940 of the tools 200, 300, 400, 910 can each include a plating reactor such as described in \u201cImproved Anode Assembly For Electroplating Apparatus\u201d, U.S. Ser. No. 09/112,300 filed Jul. 9, 1998, or an adjustable plating reactor as described in \u201cWorkpiece Processor Having Processing Chamber With Improved Processing Fluid Flow\u201d, PCT/US00/10210 filed Apr. 13, 2000 or \u201cSystem For Electrochemically Processing A Workpiece\u201d, PCT/US00/10120 filed Apr. 13, 2000, WO 00/14308 Mar. 16, 2000, all herein incorporated by reference. Alternate reactor types are described in WO 00/20663, published Apr. 13, 2000; WO 99/10566, published Mar. 4, 1999; WO 99/54527, published Oct. 28, 1999; WO 99/54920, published Oct. 28, 1999; and WO 99/25904, published May 27, 1999, and are encompassed by the invention and incorporated herein by reference., 481546=In other embodiments, the apparatus E1000 can have other configurations. For example, the heat supplied by the heat source E1040 can be provided devices other than the electrical element E1080. The cooling provided to the second heat sink E1050 can be provided by mechanisms other than chilled fluid. The actuators moving the lid E1020 and the first heat sink E1060 can be powered by devices other than pneumatic devices. The apparatus E1000 (and/or other heat transfer apparatuses described above with reference to FIGS. E1A-E9) can be configured to perform thermal processes other than annealing. For example, the apparatuses can heat a microelectronic workpiece W to reflow solder on the workpiece W, cure or bake photoresist on the workpiece W, and/or perform other processes that benefit from and/or require an elevated temperature. The heat source of the apparatus can heat the microelectronic workpiece conductively by contacting the workpiece directly, and/or conductively via an intermediate gas or liquid, and/or convectively via an intermediate gas or liquid, and/or radiatively. The heat source and the workpiece support can be fixed relative to each other or one or both of the heat source and the workpiece support can be moveable relative to the other. The first heat sink can be moveable relative to the heat source and the second heat sink or alternatively these components can be fixed relative to each other and can selectively heat or cool the workpiece by introducing fluid media between the heat source and the first heat sink and/or between the first heat sink and the second heat sink., 472071=In a further aspect of this embodiment, the first heat sink E1060 can include a vacuum supply passageway E1062 connected (via a connecting passage E1028 c) to a vacuum port E1065 in the outer surface of the apparatus E1000. The vacuum supply passageway E1062 is coupled to one or more radial vacuum channels E1063 and one or more circumferential vacuum channels E1064 in an upper surface of the first heat sink E1060 to draw the first heat sink E1060 into close thermal contact with the heat source E1040 when the heat source E1040 and the first heat sink E1060 are engaged with each other. The upper surface of the first heat sink E1060 can also include a compressible, conductive thermal pad E1066 having an engaging surface E1067 to provide close thermal contact with the heat source E1040 when the first heat sink E1060 is in its raised position. In another aspect of this embodiment, the lower surface of the first heat sink E1060 can include a compressible, conductive thermal pad generally similar to the pad E1066 to improve the thermal contact with the second heat sink E1050., 468275=When the lid E1020 is in the closed position, the lid E1020 and the base E1010 define a chamber volume E1008 around the microelectronic workpiece W. As described above with reference to FIG. E1B, it can be advantageous to purge the region around the microelectronic workpiece W during the annealing process. Accordingly, the lid E1020 can include a purge fluid passageway E1022 that transmits a purge fluid (such as nitrogen) to the chamber volume E1008 via a manifold E1027. The manifold E1027 is aligned with a purge fluid diffusion plate E1025 that is perforated with purge fluid apertures E1024 leading directly into the chamber volume E1008. The passageway E1022 can also be coupled to a purge fluid port E1023 via a connecting passage E1028 a. The purge fluid port E1023 can be connected to a source of purge fluid (not shown). In one embodiment, the purge fluid port E1023 for the upper chamber E1003 a can be positioned in the cover E1030, and the purge fluid port E1023 for the lower chamber E1003 b can be positioned in the base E1010 of the upper chamber E1003 a. The connecting passages E1028 a for both chambers E1003 can extend laterally outwardly to couple to the purge fluid ports E1023 at the outer surface of the apparatus E1000 and can extend upwardly to avoid interfering with the annular lid actuators E1021. The purge fluid can exit the chamber volume E1008 through purge fluid exit openings E1026 at the outer surface of the apparatus E1000., 478556=After the microelectronic workpiece W has been heated, the first heat sink E1060 can move upwardly into engagement with the lower surface of the heat source E1040 to cool the heat source E1040 and the microelectronic workpiece W. A vacuum is applied to the vacuum supply passageway E1062 via the vacuum port E1065 to draw the first heat sink E1060 into close thermal engagement with the heat source E1040. In one embodiment, the microelectronic workpiece W can be cooled to a temperature below 70 degrees Celsius in 18 seconds. The flow of process gas is then replaced with a flow of purge gas. After the cooling phase is complete, the first heat sink E1060 moves downwardly into engagement with the second heat sink E1050 to cool the first heat sink E1060. Simultaneously, the lid E1050 can be raised to open the chamber E1003, and the transfer mechanism E620 can be moved into the open chamber to engage the microelectronic workpiece W and remove it for further processing. The second heat sink E1050 can be cooled during or after contact with the first heat sink E1060 by providing cooling fluid to the cooling channel E1054., 185182=The reactor B2100 can have an upper chamber member that includes an upper chamber wall B2120 and a lower chamber member that includes a lower chamber wall B2140. These walls B2120, B2140, are arranged to open so as to permit a wafer B10 to be loaded into the reactor B100 for processing, by a loading and unloading mechanism (not shown) that, for example, may be in the form of a robot having an end effector. These walls B2120, B2140, are arranged to close so as to define a capsule B2160 supporting a wafer B10 in a processing position, between these walls B2120, B2140., 470031=During the elevated temperature portion of the annealing process, the microelectronic workpiece W can be engaged with the heat source E1040. Accordingly, the upper surface of the heat source E1040 can include a solid state material that can transfer heat to the microelectronic workpiece by conduction. The heat source E1040 can also include vacuum apertures E1041 coupled to a vacuum source (not shown), as described in greater detail below, to draw the microelectronic workpiece W into close engagement with the heat source E1040 during heating. For example, the heat source E1040 can be supported relative to the base E1010 with a plurality of heat source supports E1044, at least one of which includes a vacuum passage E1043 (shown in the lower chamber E1003 b) in fluid communication with the vacuum apertures E1041. The vacuum passage E1043 can also be connected (via a connecting passage E1028 b) to a heater vacuum port E1042 at the outer surface of the apparatus E1000 for coupling to the vacuum source., 374987=One significant distinction between the embodiments exists in connection with the anode electrodes and the appertaining structures and fluid flow paths. More particularly, the processing container C39 includes a plurality of ring-shaped anodes C1015, C1020, C1025 and C1030 that are concentrically disposed with respect to one another in respective anode chamber housings C1017, C1022, C1027 and C1032. As shown, each anode C1015, C1020, C1025 and C1030 has a vertically oriented surface area that is greater than the surface area of the corresponding anodes shown in the foregoing embodiments. Four such anodes are employed in the disclosed embodiment, but a larger or smaller number of anodes may be used depending upon the electrochemical processing parameters and results that are desired. Each anode C1015, C1020, C1025 and C1030 is supported in the respective anode chamber housing C1017, C1022, C1027 and C1032 by at least one corresponding support/conductive member C1050 that extends through the bottom of the processing base C37 and terminates at an electrical connector C1055 for connection to an electrical power source., 184552=With reference to FIGS. B1-B5, there is shown an embodiment of a reactor B2100 for processing a microelectronic workpiece, such as a silicon wafer B10 having an upper side B12, a lower side B14, and an outer, circular perimeter B16, in a micro-environment. For certain applications, the upper side B12 is the front side, which may be otherwise called the device side, and the lower side B14 is the back side, which may be otherwise called the non-device side. However, for other applications, the silicon wafer B10 is inverted., 383797=This latter inlet arrangement assists in further electrically isolating anodes C1015, C1020, C1025 and C1030 from one another. Such electrical isolation occurs due to the increased resistance of the electrical flow path between the anodes. The increased resistance is a direct result of the increased length of the fluid flow paths that exist between the anode chamber housings., 188961=As compared to reactors of the type disclosed in the previously described embodiments, the reactor B2100 is particularly suitable for executing a range of unique microfabrication processes. For example, reactor B2100 is particularly suited to execute a process that requires complete contact of a processing fluid at a first side of a workpiece and at only a peripheral margin portion of the second side thereof. Such processes may be realized because processing fluids entering the inlet B2142 of the lower chamber wall B2140 can act on the lower side B14 of a supported wafer B10, on the outer periphery B16 of the supported wafer B10, and on an outer margin B18 of the upper side B12 of the supported wafer B10 before reaching the outlets B2124 and because processing fluids entering the inlet B2122 of the upper chamber wall B2120 can act on the upper side B12 of the supported wafer B10, except for the outer margin B18 of the upper side B12, before reaching the outlets B2124., 377360=Each anode chamber housing C1017, C1022, C1027 and C1032 includes an upper outlet region that opens to a respective cup C1085. Cups C1085, as illustrated, are disposed in the reactor chamber so that they are concentric with one another. Each cup includes an upper rim C1090 that terminates at a predetermined height with respect to the other rims, with the rim of each cup terminating at a height that is vertically below the immediately adjacent outer concentric cup. Each of the three innermost cups further includes a substantially vertical exterior wall C1095 and a slanted interior wall C1200. This wall construction creates a flow region C1205 in the interstitial region between concentrically disposed cups (excepting the innermost cup that has a contoured interior wall that defines the fluid flow region C1205 and than the outer most flow region C1205 associated with the outer most anode) that increases in area as the fluid flows upward toward the surface of the microelectronic workpiece under process. The increase in area effectively reduces the fluid flow velocity along the vertical fluid flow path, with the velocity being greater at a lower portion of the flow region C1205 when compared to the velocity of the fluid flow at the upper portion of the particular flow region., 474768=The operation of an embodiment of the apparatus E1000 described above is explained below with reference to FIG. E9. The operation of the upper chamber E1003 a can be independent of the operation of the lower chamber E1003 b. Accordingly, for either chamber E1003 a, E1003 b, the lid E1020 is initially moved to the raised or open position shown in FIG. E9. The chamber volume E1008 can be purged with a relatively low flow rate of inert gas, such as N2, flowing through the purge fluid passageway E1022 via the purge fluid port E1023. The heat source E1040 can idle at an average temperature of approximately 50 degrees Celsius. Alternatively, the heat source E1040 can be turned off or deactivated, and in another alternate embodiment, the heat source E1040 can be fully activated. In still a further alternate embodiment, the heat source E1040 can idle at a temperature other than 50 degrees Celsius. In any of the foregoing embodiments, the first heat sink E1060 can be positioned against the second heat sink E1050 to cool the first heat sink E1060., 187905=When the upper and lower chamber walls B2120, B2140, are closed, they define a micro-environment reactor B2160 having an upper processing chamber B2126 that is defined by the upper chamber wall B2120 and by a first generally planar surface of the supported wafer B10, and a lower processing chamber B2146 that is defined by the lower chamber wall B2140 and a second generally planar surface of the supported wafer opposite the first side. The upper and lower processing chambers B2126, B2146, are in fluid communication with each other in an annular region B2130 beyond the outer perimeter B16 of the supported wafer B10 and are sealed by an annular, compressible seal (e.g., O-ring) B2132 bounding a lower portion B2134 of the annular region B2130. The seal B2132 allows processing fluids entering the lower inlet B2142 to remain under sufficient pressure to flow toward the outlets B2134., 390145=FIG. C16 illustrates a further embodiment of a processing tool in which an RTP station C1635, located in portion C1630, that includes at least one thermal reactor, may be integrated in a tool set. Unlike the embodiment of FIG. C15, at least one thermal reactor is serviced by a dedicated robotic mechanism C1640. The dedicated robotic mechanism C1640 accepts workpieces that are transferred to it by the robotic transfer mechanisms C1620. Transfer may take place through an intermediate staging door/area C1645. As such, it becomes possible to hygienically separate the RTP portion C1630 of the processing tool from other portions of the tool. Additionally, using such a construction, the illustrated annealing station may be implemented as a separate module that is attached to upgrade an existing tool set. It will be recognized that other types of processing stations may be located in portion C1630 in addition to or instead of RTP station C1635., 185878=The reactor B2100, which defines a rotation axis A, has a head B2200 containing a rotor B2210, which mounts the upper chamber wall B2120, and mounting a motor B2220 for rotating the rotor B2210 and the upper and lower chamber walls B2120, B2140, when closed, around the axis A, conjointly with a wafer B10 supported in the processing position. The motor B2220 is arranged to drive a sleeve B2222, which is supported radially in the head B2200, by rolling-element bearings B2224. The head B2200 is arranged to be raised for opening these walls B2120, B2140, and to be lowered for closing these walls B2120, B2140., 473343=In one embodiment, the first heat sink E1060 has no active cooling elements. Accordingly, an advantage of this arrangement is that no cooling fluid supply lines are connected to the first heat sink E1060, which can eliminate the complexity associated with fluid couplings attached to a movable heat sink. Instead, the second heat sink E1050 can be actively cooled and can cool the first heat sink E1060 when the first heat sink E1060 is disengaged from the heat source E1040 and engaged with the second heat sink E1050. Accordingly, the second heat sink E1050 can include a cooling channel E1054 coupled to a cooling fluid supply port and a return port described in greater detail below with reference to FIG. E18. The second heat sink E1050 can also include a cooling member cap E1051 that seals and defines, in part, the cooling channel E1054. In an alternate embodiment, the first heat sink E1060 can be actively cooled (for example, with cooling fluid) in addition to or in lieu of actively cooling the second heat sink E1050. Such an arrangement can increase the speed with which the first heat sink E1060 (and/or the heat source E1040 and workpiece W) cools because the first heat sink E1060 can be cooled while it is engaged with the heat source E1040., 98803=This application is a continuation in part of the following U.S. patent applications: U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/612,176, filed Jul. 8, 2000; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/733,608, filed Dec. 8, 2000; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/866,463, filed May 24, 2001; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/872,151, filed May 31, 2001., 389461=The workpieces are transferred between the processing stations C1610 and the RTP station C1615 using one or more robotic transfer mechanisms C1620 that are disposed for linear movement along a central track C1625. One or more of the stations C1610 may also incorporate structures that are adapted for executing an in-situ rinse. Preferably, all of the processing stations as well as the robotic transfer mechanisms are disposed in a cabinet that is provided with filtered air at a positive pressure to thereby limit airborne contaminants that may reduce the effectiveness of the microelectronic workpiece processing., 179098=When the upper and lower chamber walls A1120, A1140, are closed, they define a micro-environment reactor A1160 having an upper processing chamber A126 that is defined by the upper chamber wall A120 and by a first generally planar surface of the supported wafer A1010, and a lower processing chamber A146 that is defined by the lower chamber wall A140 and a second generally planar surface of the supported wafer opposite the first side. The upper and lower processing chambers A1126, A1146, are in fluid communication with each other in an annular region A1130 beyond the outer perimeter A16 of the supported wafer A1010 and are sealed by an annular, compressible seal (e.g., O-ring) A1132 bounding a lower portion A1134 of the annular region A1130. The seal A1132 allows processing fluids entering the lower inlet A1142 to remain under sufficient pressure to flow toward the outlets A1134., 178485=The upper chamber wall A1120 includes an array of similar outlets A1124, which are spaced similarly at uniform angular spacings around the vertical axis A. In the disclosed embodiment, thirty-six such outlets A1124 are employed. Each outlet A1124 is spaced outwardly from the vertical axis A by a comparatively larger radial distance and is spaced inwardly from the outer perimeter A1016 of a wafer A1010 supported in the processing position by a comparatively smaller radial distance, such as a distance of approximately 1.5 millimeters.}",
