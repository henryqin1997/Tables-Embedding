It benefits from the cost savings and flexibility of cloud computing. We estimate that G-Cloud will achieve savings of 50% for services bought through it. At the current rate of spending (\u00a316 million per month), savings of around \u00a3200 million could be achieved in the financial year ending March 2015 by:, 4740=The Government Digital Service (GDS) is leading the digital transformation of government. GDS was set up following Martha Lane Fox\u2019s report, Directgov 2010 and beyond: revolution not evolution, to make sure the government provides world-class digital services that meet people\u2019s needs., 24803=At the exemplar level, benefits are shared almost equally between government and users \u2013 ie people and businesses. As the scope extends, benefits go mainly to government. By financial year ending March 2016 we estimate that the exemplars will have achieved about 70% of their potential benefits. These early benefits are influenced by certain benefits such as increasing tax collection and reducing EU fines., 69256=This table shows in which quarters services are planning to start using identity assurance in financial year ending March 2015., 25837=Publishing for all central government departments was moved over to GOV.UK in 2013. Agency and arm\u2019s length bodies are following, and around 300 will be moved by December 2014. Assuming a 50% cost saving, this will achieve a 5 year saving of around \u00a350 million., 156149=If the work plan remains constant, from June onwards, or when carrying vacancies, the team would be unable to work on new projects or more work without extra resources., 27165=G-Cloud has helped to grow the UK economy by creating new jobs. A survey carried out in May 2014 showed that 29 suppliers have created 356 new jobs as a result of work gained through G-Cloud., 67051=We will address this by talking to service providers about connecting useful data to the platform. The first cross government event is planned for 17 June 2014., 22280=GOV.UK has been live since early 2012, and gets over 1.5 million visits per day, saving at least \u00a350 million per year., 2766=Published 4 July 2014, 22171=Twenty-five of government\u2019s most important services will be digital by default by March 2015., 29334=At the last Spending Review it was agreed that the GDS budget would reduce from \u00a321.1 million to \u00a316.12 million between financial year ending March 2012 and the financial year ending March 2015., 78716=We will address this by making sure spending has been approved and a Head of Operations hired. We\u2019re also hiring more staff, with new members of the operations team joining during 2014.}",
