            "Bowling Green is a very safe campus. If you have a night class and do not feel comfortable walking back to your dorm alone, you can call campus security and they will escort you back to your dorm.",
            "There are a lot of Sororities and Fraternities at Bowling Green, and everyone seems to become one big family.",
            "There is a club for almost everyone at Bowling Green.",
            "BGSU is great for people who love to make friends, love the cold (cause when you are walking to class in the middle of winter, its freezing!!), and love to have fun in a somewhat small town.",
            "On BG by the dorm Kreisher there is a big boulder that close to every week is painted a different color by a different club on campus. In between Harshman and Kreisher there is open land where the basketball courts are and it is really nice to go out there and sit to study on a nice day.",
            "All sporting events on campus are free to students all you have to do is show your BGSU ID. The tickets for concerts and comedy shows are very inexpensive and the rec center that has the swimming pool and volleyball is free to students as well.",
            "There are basketball courts, a swimming pool, a work out center, rock climbing, sporting events, volleyball. There are also concerts scheduled throughout the year and sometimes there are even comedians that come to the campus.",
            "The food on campus is very good for the most part. There are days when it is not the best, but for the most part, its very delicious. BUDGET YOUR MONEY! If you do not budget your meal plan you will run out before the end of the semester.",
            "The dorm rooms are a good size as long as you don't bring your entire bedroom with you. Try really hard to get along with your roommate because you will be seeing their face everyday for the whole year. If you have a problem talk to them directly about it, do not complain about them behind their back. The Resident Advisers are very nice and make sure that the rules are being followed.",
            "Do not take too many credit hours right away until you know how much you can handle, otherwise you may overwhelm yourself. Start off low and gradually work your way up.",
            "Apply for as many scholarships as you can. Work hard and do not be afraid to ask your professors for help if you are struggling.",
            "Bowling Green State University is a great school. The campus is beautiful and the people of the town are great. The professors at Bowling Green care about your education and want you to succeed in your college career."

At BGSU we seriously have something for everyone... from Warm Up BG to TOMS CLUB to Greek Life. It all just depends on who you want to be associated with in College... Parties are everywhere so there won't be a problem finding one... EVER!, 805574=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 193911=Right now our Greek life is under construction. In 2016 we will have all brand new fraternity and sorority houses built. I'm not involved in Greek life but my friends that are say that it is a little bit expensive but still a great experience., 760441=There are many things to do for fun at BGSU. There are many organizations and clubs you can join. I joined an outdoor activities program where we go on many trips together, it has been a blast. I also joined a few Christian Organizations where you gathered together on campus performing activities and worshipping. I also studied abroad in Argentina. It was the best experience of my life and BGSU made the process very smooth. There are many different events/concerts and sports events. Our football team was the 2013 MAC Champions so they are always fun to watch., 344072=The weather is a little so-so sometimes; the wind is something to get used to. But overall, it's a great place. I attended the 2011 fall semester, and didn't attend the spring semester and I greatly missed having so much to do and look forward to returning., 722748=Bowling Green State University's football team was a ranked team this year, and definitely is getting better and better each year! On campus there are many restaurants, bars and clubs to spend time at. There are also lots of festivities with freebies happening multiple times per month. Hockey games are also definitely a must when attending Bowling Green, the stadium is always packed and in spirit! The union has a movie theater, and food options until 2:30 in the morning. Even in the middle of the night during the week, there always seems to be something happening on campus!, 752481=Bowling Green offers more than I ever thought it would. There's an on campus medical center if you ever aren't feeling well. The library offers so many awesome things as well. If you just need to talk to someone, there are counselors and psychologists available for you to talk to for free! There are video and sound recording devices you can rent, bikes you can use, TV's everywhere, along with plugs for laptops and phones. The Rec center is currently being amazingly updated and I am so monumentally excited for when that is done later in 2014. BG has so much to offer, it really is worth the money you put in., 321304=Some tips I would share with prospective students would be to visit BGSU. I had never even considered going there until my friend offered to take me on a visit, once i took my first few steps on the gorgeous campus ground I knew it was THE one. I would also tell them to apply early and choose BGSU before October so that they could sign up for housing and be housed in the brand new Cenntenial dorms that have their own bathrooms., 415226=There are truly many different levels of academics at BGSU. Some classes range from 1000-4000 levels, with the top being the most difficult. However, BGSU is very helpful in the sense that the earlier classes prepare students for the later classes (which will be taken during the junior and senior years). Also, although students are expected to excel in the classroom and give adequate effort, professors are extremely helpful and an unbelievable amount of resources are offered to students in order to accommodate any difficulty that they may encounter. As a student you are expected to put effort into your studies, but you'll find that you are never alone and there is someone who wants to see you succeed at every turn., 427687=Campus is a very safe place. There are lights all over the place to make sure no one is walking completely in the dark and a shuttle runs until 2:30 a.m. on weekends or 10:00 p.m. on weekdays to get people around campus or even take them off campus. There are emergency phones within eyesight everywhere on campus., 685642=For fun, you can always tour downtown and go to the many places that are downtown (which is not far from campus at all). There are normally events on campus such as huge movies nights that are held outside on a LARGE projector. BGSU will also have a completely new Recreations center in the fall of 2014 where you can participate in multiple activities such as basketball, racquetball, rock climbing, swimming etc. There is also a lot of fun within your own dorms, such as ping-pong tables, pool tables, etc., 123714=I would go to one of BGSU's preview days. I went to one in October and I learned much about the school, majors, financial aid, and housing.}",

They offer many different majors and also different and unique class choices that give people the opportunities to widen their views and experiences while in college. Anyone can attend Bowling Green and have the experience they always wanted, just like I have. Tips for prospective students Bowling Green is a great college for someone who wants to have",
