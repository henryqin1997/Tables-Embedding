    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6334=Referring to FIG. 1, for instance, one embodiment of a method for forming a cast film is shown. The raw materials (e.g., thermoplastic starch, polylactic acid, aliphatic-aromatic copolyester, filler, etc.) may be supplied to a melt blending device, either separately or as a blend. In one embodiment, for example, the components are separately supplied to a melt blending device where they are dispersively blended in a manner such as described above. For example, an extruder may be employed that includes feeding and venting ports. In one embodiment, the thermoplastic starch, polylactic acid, and aliphatic-aromatic copolyester may be fed to a feeding port of the twin-screw extruder and melted. Thereafter, the filler may be fed into the polymer melt. Regardless, the materials are blended under high shear/pressure and heat to ensure sufficient mixing. Melt blending generally occurs at a temperature that is slightly at or above the softening point of the aliphatic-aromatic copolyester and below the decomposition temperature of the blend. For example, melt blending may occur at a temperature of from about 75\ufffd C. to about 300\ufffd C., in some embodiments, from about 80\ufffd C. to about 250\ufffd C., and in some embodiments, from about 90\ufffd C. to about 200\ufffd C. Likewise, the apparent shear rate during melt blending may range from about 100 seconds\u22121 to about 10,000 seconds\u22121, in some embodiments from about 500 seconds\u22121 to about 5000 seconds\u22121, and in some embodiments, from about 800 seconds\u22121 to about 1200 seconds\u22121. The apparent shear rate is equal to 4 Q/\u03c0R3, where Q is the volumetric flow rate (\u201cm3/s\u201d) of the polymer melt and R is the radius (\u201cm\u201d) of the capillary (e.g., extruder die) through which the melted polymer flows.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{69347=In one particular embodiment, the filler includes particles formed from calcium carbonate. If desired, calcium carbonate particles may be employed that have a purity of at least about 95 wt. %, in some embodiments at least about 98 wt. %, and in some embodiments, at least about 99 wt. %. Such high purity calcium carbonates are generally fine, soft, and round, and thus provide a more controlled and narrow particle size for improving the properties of the film. An example of such a high purity calcium carbonate is Caribbean micritic calcium carbonate, which is mined from soft and friable, finely divided, chalk-like marine sedimentary deposits frequently occurring as surface deposits in the Caribbean (e.g., Jamaica). Such calcium carbonates typically have an average particle size of about 10 micrometers or less, and desirably about 6 micrometers or less. Other examples of Caribbean micritic calcium carbonates are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,102,465 to Lamond, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference thereto for all purposes. Such calcium carbonates may be wet or dry ground, and classified into a narrow particle size distribution with round or spherical-shaped particles. One particularly suitable micritic calcium carbonate is available from Specialty Minerals under the designation \u201cMD1517.\u201d, 47233=Regardless of the particular manner in which it is formed, the thermoplastic starch typically has an apparent viscosity of from about 25 to about 500 Pascal seconds (Pa\ufffds), in some embodiments from about 50 to about 400 Pa\ufffds, and in some embodiments, from about 100 to about 300 Pa\ufffds, as determined at a temperature of 150\ufffd C. and a shear rate of 1000 sec\u22121. The melt flow index (190\ufffd C., 2.16 kg) of the thermoplastic starch may also range from about 0.05 to about 50 grams per 10 minutes, in some embodiments from about 0.1 to about 15 grams per 10 minutes, and in some embodiments, from about 0.5 to about 5 grams per 10 minutes., 74669=Any known technique may be used to form a film from the compounded material, including blowing, casting, flat die extruding, etc. In one particular embodiment, the film may be formed by a blown process in which a gas (e.g., air) is used to expand a bubble of the extruded polymer blend through an annular die. The bubble is then collapsed and collected in flat film form. Processes for producing blown films are described, for instance, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,354,506 to Raley; U.S. Pat. No. 3,650,649 to Schippers; and U.S. Pat. No. 3,801,429 to Schrenk et al., as well as U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2005/0245162 to McCormack, et al. and 2003/0068951 to Boggs, et al., all of which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference thereto for all purposes. In yet another embodiment, however, the film is formed using a casting technique., 65955=The aliphatic-aromatic copolyester typically has a number average molecular weight (\u201cMn\u201d) ranging from about 40,000 to about 120,000 grams per mole, in some embodiments from about 50,000 to about 100,000 grams per mole, and in some embodiments, from about 60,000 to about 85,000 grams per mole. Likewise, the polymer also typically has a weight average molecular weight (\u201cMw\u201d) ranging from about 70,000 to about 360,000 grams per mole, in some embodiments from about 80,000 to about 250,000 grams per mole, and in some embodiments, from about 100,000 to about 200,000 grams per mole. The polydispersity index is also relatively low, such as from about 1.0 to about 3.0, in some embodiments from about 1.2 to about 2.0, and in some embodiments, from about 1.4 to about 1.8. The melt flow index of the aromatic-aliphatic polyester may also range from about 0.1 to about 10 grams per 10 minutes, in some embodiments from about 0.5 to about 8 grams per 10 minutes, and in some embodiments, from about 1 to about 5 grams per 10 minutes. The melt flow index is the weight of a polymer (in grams) that may be forced through an extrusion rheometer orifice (0.0825-inch diameter) when subjected to a load of 2160 grams in 10 minutes at a certain temperature (e.g., 190\ufffd C.), measured in accordance with ASTM Test Method D1238-E., 71967=In addition to the components noted above, other additives may also be incorporated into the film of the present invention, such as melt stabilizers, processing stabilizers, heat stabilizers, light stabilizers, antioxidants, heat aging stabilizers, whitening agents, antiblocking agents, bonding agents, etc. Phosphite stabilizers (e.g., IRGAFOS available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals of Terrytown, N.Y. and DOVERPHOS available from Dover Chemical Corp. of Dover, Ohio) are exemplary melt stabilizers. In addition, hindered amine stabilizers (e.g., CHIMASSORB available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals) are exemplary heat and light stabilizers. Further, hindered phenols are commonly used as an antioxidant in the production of films. Some suitable hindered phenols include those available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals under the trade name \u201cIrganox\ufffd\u201d, such as Irganox\ufffd 1076,1010, or E 201. Moreover, bonding agents may also be added to the film to facilitate bonding of the film to additional materials (e.g., nonwoven web). Examples of such bonding agents include hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins. Other suitable bonding agents are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,789,699 to Kieffer et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,695,868 to McCormack, which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference thereto for all purposes. When employed, additives (e.g., lubricant, antioxidant, stabilizer, etc.) may each be present in an amount of from about 0.001 wt. % to about 1 wt. %, in some embodiments, from about 0.005 wt. % to about 1 wt. %, and in some embodiments, from 0.01 wt. % to about 0.5 wt. % of the blend used to form the film., 52169=The polylactic acid may also have an apparent viscosity of from about 50 to about 600 Pascal seconds (Pa\ufffds), in some embodiments from about 100 to about 500 Pa\ufffds, and in some embodiments, from about 200 to about 400 Pa\ufffds, as determined at a temperature of 190\ufffd C. and a shear rate of 1000 sec\u22121. The melt flow rate of the polylactic acid (on a dry basis) may also range from about 0.1 to about 40 grams per 10 minutes, in some embodiments from about 0.5 to about 20 grams per 10 minutes, and in some embodiments, from about 5 to about 15 grams per 10 minutes. The melt flow rate is the weight of a polymer (in grams) that may be forced through an extrusion rheometer orifice (0.0825-inch diameter) when subjected to a load of 2160 grams in 10 minutes at a certain temperature (e.g., 190\ufffd C.), measured in accordance with ASTM Test Method D1238-E.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Con riferimenti in While the invention has been described in detail with respect to the specific embodiments thereof, it will be appreciated that those skilled in the art, upon attaining an understanding of the foregoing, may readily conceive of alterations to, variations of, and equivalents to these embodiments. Accordingly, the scope of the present invention should be assessed as that of the appended claims and any equivalents thereto. As indicated, the addition of 4030D PLA increased the stiffness of the films, but the varying amounts of talc did not substantially change material properties. For example, when adding 10% of both 4030D PLA and talc, the modulus increased from 87 MPa to 186 MPa in the MD and from 85 MPa to 135 MPa in the CD, when compared to a pure 60/40 ECOFLEX\ufffd/TPS blend. The modulus remained similar when the amount of talc was increased from 10% to 20%. While the modulus remained fairly constant with either 10% or 20% talc addition, the elongation results continued to decrease. This decrease occurred as all other components (ECOFLEX\ufffd, TPS and PLA) remained constant. Further, as the ratio of ductile-to-rigid components decreased, the modulus generally decreased and the strain at break (\u201cpeak elongation\u201d) generally increased. 18 11 157 195 192 97 11 13",
