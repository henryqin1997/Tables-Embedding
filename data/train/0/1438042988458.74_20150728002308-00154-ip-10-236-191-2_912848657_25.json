    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Women/female-bodied, motivated, academically curious, interested in the sciences, interested in women's studies, opinionated, bold, passionate, driven, eclectic. Tips for prospective students -Visit if you can. You'll learn a lot about the campus if you can just walk around by yourself, away from tour groups. -Talk to current students. Most Smithies will tell you everything they like and don't like about the school--we're very opinionated. -Smith has a fairly sizeable and visible LGBTQ population. Sometimes the school does not emphasize this in their admissions propaganda, but it's definitely true and something to be aware of. We take treating everyone with respect very seriously here. -Smith also has a lot of liberals and moderates-- but that doesn't mean that conservatives aren't welcome. Some of us like having someone to argue with. ;) -Some Smith students are men. We have transpeople on campus, and graduate students who are men. -Just because you go to a women's school does NOT mean you won't ever see men. Guys from other schools take classes here, people from town are on campus, there are male teachers, etc. -Some Smithies are non-traditional aged students called Ada Comstock Scholars. They're pretty cool, and bring a unique perspective to whatever they do. Some of them live on campus, and some life off-campus. -Explore NoHo. It's pretty cool. -If you go to Herrell's Ice Cream",
