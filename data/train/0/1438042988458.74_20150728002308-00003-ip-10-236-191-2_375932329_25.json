He was the son of James Bevan and Elizabeth Fly. He played for Clifton in the 1878-1879 season. On October 10th 1877 he went to St. Johns College, Cambridge University where he gained 2 blues in 1877 and 1880. He completed his BA in 1881 and his MA in 1891. He became captain of the first Wales XV but after a disastrous match was never selected again. He went on to become an Anglican Clergyman., 14591=England v Wales on 19th February 1881 at Blackheath was the first international between the countries. A game more noted for the chaotic organisation of the Welsh side than anything else. It was Wales first international. Organised before the Welsh RFU was set up. The players had never played together before. One player, Major Richard Summers was selected for Wales on his performances a couple of years earlier for his school, Cheltenham College, in matches against Cardiff and Newport. No formal invitations to play were sent out to the Welsh XV. Two of those expected to appear didn't turn up so bystanders, University undergraduates with tenuous Welsh links but who had traveled to London to see the match, had to be roped in to play for Wales. It also didn't help that the changing rooms were a local pub (The Princess of Wales which remains to this day). Both teams had to walk the half a mile across the common to play. Rumour has it that the Welsh team needed some Dutch courage before the match so had been drinking heavily. The game was a farce. The Welsh were hopelessly outplayed and under modern scoring values lost 82-0. Harry Vassall scored a hat-trick on this his debut for England. It is recorded that that the England captain Lennard Stokes threw a colossal pass to Hunt, giving him an easy try, but the umpires ordered it back, their decision that a long pass was not football. Afterwards the RFU were not impressed and the fixture was dropped the following season.}",

Great Dinham Farm was situated adjacent to the crumbling remains of Dinham Castle. In fact parts of the Castle were used in the construction of a barn at the farm about 1857. There was formerly a church at Dinham, some traces of which may be seen at the gable end of one of the farm, buildings belonging to Great Dinham farm. The font is used as a pump-trough in the farm yard and the lid of a stone coffin, locally known as \"The Bishop's Stone,\" is built into the, garden wall.

Frederick Arthur Sibly and Thomas Dix Sibly were brothers of George William Sibly who founded Wycliffe College in 1882. William had been teaching at the Wesleyan Collegiate.

During 1841-42 a cargo yacht \"Lady of St. Kilda\" was anchored in the bay, having been placed there for sale or barter. A colonial historian, Henry Gyles Turner, recorded that J.B. Were had an interest in the yacht and selected the raised sea side knoll at St. Kilda as the place for a picnic. The yacht's captain was apparently present.

Money ran out during the construction of the tower at the south east corner of the church which explains why the tower doesn't go above aisle level.
