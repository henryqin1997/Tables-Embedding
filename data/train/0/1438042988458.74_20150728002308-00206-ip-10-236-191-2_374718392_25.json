The fixed audio source will not play possibly due to memory or resource shortage., 231127=Explanation\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This alarm occurs when allocation of an RSVP Agent fails for all the registered RSVP Agents (RSVP Agents are basically MTPs or transcoder devices which provide RSVP functionalities) belonging to the Media Resource Group List and Default List. Each RSVP Agent may fail for different reasons. Following are some of the reasons that could cause an RSVP Agent allocation to fail: Available MTP/transcoders do not support RSVP functionality; A capability mismatch between the device endpoint and MTP/transcoder, Codec mismatch between the endpoint and the MTP/transcoder; A lack of available bandwidth between the endpoint and the MTP/transcoder; Or because the MTP/transcoder resources are already in use. A capability mismatch may be due to the MTP/transcoder not supporting one or more of the required capabilities for the call such as Transfer Relay Point (which is needed for QoS or firewall traversal), RFC 2833 DTMF (which is necessary when one side of the call does not support RFC 2833 format for transmitting DTMF digits and the other side must receive the DTMF digits in RFC 2833 format, resulting in conversion of the DTMF digits), RFC 2833 DTMF passthrough (in this case, the MTP or transcoder does not need to convert the DTMF digits from one format to another format but it needs to receive DTMF digits from one endpoint and transmit them to the other endpoint without performing any modifications), passthrough (where no codec conversion will occur, meaning the media device will receive media streams in any codec format and transmit them to the other side without performing any codec conversion), IPv4 to IPv6 conversion (when one side of the call supports only IPv4 and the other side of the call supports only IPv6 and so MTP needs to be inserted to perform the necessary conversion between IPv4 and IPv6 packets), or multimedia capability (if a call involving video and/or data in addition to audio requires insertion of an MTP or transcoder then the MTP/transcoder which supports multimedia will be inserted)., 468699=CCM_MEDIA_STREAMING_APP-IPVMS-3-kFixedInputAddAudioCaptureDeviceFailed : Add fixed audio source to filter graph failure.\u00a0 Audio Source ID\u00a0[ULong] Codec Type\u00a0[String] COM Error\u00a0[ULong], 497995=CCM_MEDIA_STREAMING_APP-IPVMS-3-kMOHFilterNotifyError : Error on DirectShow returned or user abort.\u00a0 Audio Source ID\u00a0[ULong] Codec Type\u00a0[String], 488523=CCM_MEDIA_STREAMING_APP-IPVMS-4-kGetFileNameFailed : Get audio source file name failure.\u00a0 Audio Source ID\u00a0[ULong] Codec Type\u00a0[String], 482575=CCM_MEDIA_STREAMING_APP-IPVMS-3-kFixedInputGetMediaControlFailed : Get fixed media control failure.\u00a0 Audio Source ID\u00a0[ULong] Codec Type\u00a0[String] COM Error\u00a0[ULong], 490047=CCM_MEDIA_STREAMING_APP-IPVMS-3-kGetMediaControlFailed : Get media control failure.\u00a0 Audio Source ID\u00a0[ULong] Codec Type\u00a0[String] COM Error\u00a0[ULong], 485206=CCM_MEDIA_STREAMING_APP-IPVMS-3-kFixedInputMOHEncG711AlawRenderConnFail : Connect fixed MOH encoder to G711 a-law IP VMS render filter failure.\u00a0 Audio Source ID\u00a0[ULong] Codec Type\u00a0[String] COM Error\u00a0[ULong], 475847=CCM_MEDIA_STREAMING_APP-IPVMS-4-kFixedInputCodecStreamFailed : Fixed input codec stream initialization failure.\u00a0 Audio Source ID\u00a0[ULong] System error code\u00a0[ULong] Error text\u00a0[String] Codec Type\u00a0[String], 503271=CCM_MEDIA_STREAMING_APP-IPVMS-6-kMOHRewindStreamMediaPositionObjectNull : Error rewinding MOH audio source that is not playing.\u00a0 Audio Source ID\u00a0[ULong] Codec Type\u00a0[String], 512965=Explanation\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Music-on-Hold service parameter for codec selection could not be read from database.

A 4xx response indicates errors in the call routing request from Unified CM, for example: a 400 response indicates the call routing request could not be understood by the PDP; a 404 indicates that the PDP did not find a matching request URI. A 5xx error indicates a PDP server error, for example: a 500 response indicates a PDP internal error; a 501 response indicates that the PDP does not support the functionality to generate a call routing response; a 503 indicates that the PDP is busy and temporarily cannot generate a response; a 505 indicates that the HTTP version number included in the call routing request from Unified CM is not supported.

Please check the user guide and documentation of the media device to make sure that device supports all the necessary capabilities. Also, caution should be taken if all the MTP or transcoders are configured with all the supported capabilities. There are certain capabilities (such as RFC 2833 DTMF or RFC 2833 DTMF passthrough or passthrough) which could be supported by most of the MTPs or transcoders and there may be certain capabilities (such as IPv4 to IPv6 conversion and vice versa or Transfer Relay Point or multimedia capability) which can be supported by only by a single MTP or transcoder depending on the devices that you have. For example, you may have IP phones that support only IPv4 protocol and there may also be IP phones that support only IPv6 protocol. To make a call between IPv4-only and IPv6-only phones, you need to have an MTP configured to perform the conversion of IPv4 to IPv6 and vice versa. However, suppose all the MTPs or transcoders are configured with all the supported capabilities and only one MTP supports IPv4 to IPv6 conversion; if this MTP is configured with all the supported capabilities (which all the other MTPs or transcoders in the same MRGL or default MRGL also support) it may happen that this MTP can get allocated for Transfer Relay Point or RFC 2833 DTMF or RFC 2833 DTMF passthrough or passthrough instead. As a result, when the need arises for IPv4 to IPv6 conversion (which other MTPs or transcoders in the same MRGL or default MRGL do not support), all the resources of MTP may be in use and the IPv4 to IPv6 conversion may fail. To avoid this kind of problem, setting the priority of the media resources may be a good idea. This can be done only in the Media Resource Group List and not in the Default List of the media resources. In any Media Resource Group List all the Media Resource Groups have different priorities; during allocation the first Media Resource Group is always checked for availability of the requested type of the media devices. The first Media Resource Group in the Media Resource Group List will have the highest priority, then the second one, and so on. To check all the Media Resource Groups and their priority go the Media Resources and Media Resource Group List of Cisco Unified CM Administration page and click the appropriate Media Resource Group List and check the Selected Media Resource Groups; the priority decreases from top to bottom. So, the MTP or transcoder that you want to be selected for the most basic functionalities should be positioned in the higher priority Media Resource Groups whereas the ones with more rare functionality should be positioned in the Media Resource Groups with lower priority. MTP/transcoder allocation may fail due to codec mismatch between the endpoint and the MTP/transcoder. A solution may be to configure the MTP/transcoder with all the supported codecs (as specified in the user guide of the MTP/transcoder), but be aware that doing so might result in too much bandwidth being allocated for calls. You'll need to weigh different factors such as the total amount of available bandwidth, the average number of calls, approximate bandwidth use per call (not involving MTP/transcoder), and so on, and accordingly calculate the maximum bandwidth that can be allocated per call involving an MTP/transcoder and take that into consideration when configuring the supported codecs in the MTPs and transcoders. It's a good idea to configure the media devices with all the supported codecs and set the region bandwidths to restrict too much bandwidth usage (refer to the Unified CM documentation for details on region and location settings). Also, there may be a codec mismatch between the endpoint and the MTP/transcoders after considering the region bandwidth between the MTP/transcoder and the endpoint. Increasing the region bandwidth may be a solution to the problem, but again, that decision should be made after careful consideration of the amount of bandwidth you're willing to allocate per call between the set of regions. Another possible cause that an MTP/transcoder did not get allocated is because there was not enough available bandwidth for the call. This can happen if the MTP/transcoder and endpoint belong to different locations and the bandwidth that is set between the locations is already in use by other calls. Examine the bandwidth requirements in your deployment to determine whether bandwidth between the locations can be increased. However, please note that increasing the bandwidth between these two locations means that you may need to reduce the bandwidth between other locations. Refer to the System Guide, SRNDs, and related Unified CM documentation for more details. Be aware that reducing the bandwidth or removing the higher bandwidth codecs from configuration may result in poor voice quality during call. Consider increasing the total amount of network bandwidth available. Finally, if MTP or transcoder allocation fails due to capability mismatch or all the resources being in use, consider installing additional MTP or transcoder devices. Error Message, 233204=Recommended Action\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RSVP Agents are basically Cisco IOS MTPs or transcoder devices which provide RSVP functionalities. Check the user manual of the configured MTPs and transcoders to see whether they support RSVP functionality. If none of them support RSVP functionality either they need to be upgraded (if an upgraded version supports RSVP functionality) or additional MTP or transcoders need to be installed which support RSVP functionality. If the RSVP Agent (MTP or transcoder) allocation is failing due to a capability mismatch, it's possible that the media device does not support the requested capability (such as IPv4 to IPv6 conversion, passthrough) or the capability might not be configured in the device. Please check the user guide and documentation of the media device to make sure that device supports all the necessary capabilities. Also, caution should be taken if all the MTP or transcoders are configured with all the supported capabilities. There are certain capabilities (such as RFC 2833 DTMF or RFC 2833 DTMF passthrough or passthrough) which could be supported by most of the MTPs or transcoders and there may be certain capabilities (such as IPv4 to IPv6 conversion and vice versa or RSVP Agent functionality or Transfer Relay Point or multimedia capability) which can be supported by only by a single MTP or transcoder depending on the devices that you have. For example, you may have end devices belonging to different locations and may need to reserve the bandwidth only between two locations; calls between other locations may not need to reserve the bandwidth. Now, suppose all the MTPs or transcoders are configured with all the supported capabilities and only one MTP/transcoder supports RSVP functionality; if this MTP/transcoder is configured with all the supported capabilities (which all the other MTPs or transcoders in the same MRGL or default MRGL also support) it may happen that this MTP can get allocated for Transfer Relay Point or RFC 2833 DTMF or RFC 2833 DTMF passthrough or passthrough instead. As a result, when a need arises to reserve the bandwidth (which other MTPs or transcoders in the same MRGL or default MRGL do not support), all the resources of this MTP/transcoder may be in use and the RSVP Agent allocation may fail. To avoid this situation, set the priority of the media resources appropriately. This can only be done in the Media Resource Group List and not in the Default List of the media resources. In any Media Resource Group List all the Media Resource Groups have different priorities and during allocation the first Media Resource Group is checked for availability of the requested type of the media devices. The first Media Resource Group in the Media Resource Group List will have the highest priority, then the second one and so on. To check all the Media Resource Groups and their priority go the Media Resources and Media Resource Group List in Cisco Unified CM Administration and click the appropriate Media Resource Group List, then check the Selected Media Resource Groups; the priority decreases from top to bottom. Position the MTP or transcoder that you want to be selected for the basic functionalities in the higher priority Media Resource Groups whereas the ones with more rare functionality can be positioned in the Media Resource Groups with lower priority. RSVP Agent allocation may fail due to codec mismatch between the endpoint and the RSVP Agent or MTP/transcoder. A solution may be to configure the MTP/transcoder with all the supported codecs (as specified in the user guide of the MTP/transcoder), but be aware that doing so might result in too much bandwidth being allocated for calls. You'll need to weigh different factors such as the total amount of available bandwidth, the average number of calls, approximate bandwidth use per call (not involving MTP/transcoder), and so on, and accordingly calculate the maximum bandwidth that can be allocated per call involving an MTP/transcoder and take that into consideration when configuring the supported codecs in the MTPs and transcoders. A good idea is to configure the media devices with all the supported codecs and set the region bandwidths to restrict too much bandwidth usage (refer to the Unified CM documentation for details on region and location settings). Also, there may be a codec mismatch between the endpoint and the MTP/transcoders after considering the region bandwidth between the MTP/transcoder and the endpoint. Increasing the region bandwidth may be a solution to the problem, but that decision should be made after careful consideration of the amount of bandwidth you're willing to allocate per call between the set of regions. Another possible cause that an MTP/transcoder did not get allocated is because there was not enough available bandwidth for the call. This can happen if the MTP/transcoder and endpoint belong to different locations and the bandwidth that is set between the locations is already in use by other calls. Examine the bandwidth requirements in your deployment to determine whether bandwidth between the locations can be increased. However, note that increasing the bandwidth between these two locations means that you may need to reduce the bandwidth between other locations. Refer to the System Guide, SRNDs, and related Unified CM documentation for more details. Be aware that reducing the bandwidth or removing the higher bandwidth codecs from configuration may result in poor voice quality during call. Consider increasing the total amount of network bandwidth. Finally, if RSVP Agent allocation fails due to MTP/transcoder not supporting RSVP functionality or capability mismatch or all the resources being in use, consider installing additional MTP or transcoder devices which support RSVP functionality.

Each MTP or transcoder may fail for different reasons. Following are some of the reasons that could cause an MTP or transcoder allocation to fail: a capability mismatch between the device endpoint and MTP/transcoder, codec mismatch between the endpoint and the MTP/transcoder; a lack of available bandwidth between the endpoint and the MTP/transcoder; or because the MTP/transcoders resources are already in use. A capability mismatch may be due to the MTP/transcoder not supporting one or more of the required capabilities for the call such as Transfer Relay Point (which is needed for QoS or firewall traversal), RFC 2833 DTMF (which is necessary when one side of the call does not support RFC 2833 format for transmitting DTMF digits and the other side must receive the DTMF digits in RFC 2833 format, resulting in conversion of the DTMF digits), RFC 2833 DTMF passthrough (in this case, the MTP or transcoder does not need to convert the DTMF digits from one format to another format but it needs to receive DTMF digits from one endpoint and transmit them to the other endpoint without performing any modifications), passthrough (where no codec conversion will occur, meaning the media device will receive media streams in any codec format and transmit them to the other side without performing any codec conversion), IPv4 to IPv6 conversion (when one side of the call supports only IPv4 and the other side of the call supports only IPv6 and so an MTP needs to be inserted to perform the necessary conversion between IPv4 and IPv6 packets), or multimedia capability (if a call involving video and/or data in addition to audio requires insertion of an MTP or transcoder then the MTP/transcoder which supports multimedia will be inserted)., 488027=CCM_MEDIA_STREAMING_APP-IPVMS-3-kGetEventNotificationFailed : Get notification event failure.\u00a0 Audio Source ID\u00a0[ULong] Codec Type\u00a0[String] COM Error\u00a0[ULong], 227766=Recommended Action\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If all the resources of the Annunciator are already in use, check to be sure that all the Annunciators that belong to the Media Resource Groups of the indicated Media Resource Group List and Default List are configured and registered in all the applicable Unified CM nodes of the cluster.

Check the status field to see whether it is registered with Unified CM. Note that the display on the status field is not a confirmation that the device is registered to Unified CM. It may happen in a Unified CM cluster that the Publisher can only write to the Unified CM database before the Publisher goes down. Because the Subscriber may not be able to write to the database, the devices may still display registered in Unified CM Administration after they are actually unregistered. However, if the Publisher is down that should generate another alarm with higher priority than this alarm. The Annunciator allocation can fail due to codec mismatch or capability mismatch between the endpoint and the Annunciator. If there is a codec mismatch or capability mismatch (such as the endpoint using IPv6 addressing but Annunciator supporting only IPv4), an MTP or transcoder should be allocated. If the MTP or transcoder is not allocated, either MediaResourceListExhausted (with Media Resource Type as media termination point or transcoder) or MtpNoMoreResourcesAvailable alarm will be generated for the same Media Resource Group List and you should first concentrate on that. The Annunciator allocation may even fail after checking the region bandwidth between the regions to which the held party belongs and the region to which the Annunciator belongs. Increasing the region bandwidth may be a solution to the problem, but that decision should be made after careful consideration of the amount of bandwidth you're willing to allocate per call between the set of regions. You'll need to weigh different factors such as the total amount of available bandwidth, the average number of calls, the average number of calls using the Annunciator, approximate bandwidth use per call, and so on, and accordingly calculate the region bandwidth.

Refer to the System Guide, SRNDs, and related Unified CM documentation for more details. Be aware that reducing the bandwidth or removing the higher bandwidth codecs from configuration may result in poor voice quality during call.
