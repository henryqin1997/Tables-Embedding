The original plan was to construct a network approximately 20km long with 21 stations in 2 Lines. The first 13 km including 14 stations at SYNTAGMA - ETHNIKI AMYNA Line 3 Section and at SEPOLIA \u2013 SYNTAGMA Line 2 section were commissioned in January 2000, while 5 additional km with 5 stations at SYNTAGMA-DAFNI tunnel section were commissioned in November 2000. In the framework of the Base Project, the ATTIKO METRO S.A. has financed the execution of archaeological excavations extending over 69,000 square meters \u2013 the largest archaeological excavation program ever implemented in Athens. Moreover, in order to minimize the possibility of encountering antiquities, the Metro tunnels were constructed at a depth of 15 meters, a level, which is much lower than the one where antiquities are usually encountered. The Project was constructed with the use of the most up-to-date technologies and was the outcome of the strenuous work of thousands of workers, scientists and technicians from Greece and abroad. In April 2003, SYNTAGMA-MONASTIRAKI Section was handed over to the public. The construction of MONASTIRAKI METRO Station called for the execution of archaeological excavations that brought to light residential remains dating back to the 8th century B.C. (Geometric Era) up to the 19th century. The Irridanos River embedded bed is one of the most significant archaeological finds encountered in MONASTIRAKI Station. In June 2004, DAFNI \u2013 AGHIOS DIMITRIOS Metro Section, 1.2 km long was commissioned, while in July 2004, ETHNIKI AMYNA \u2013 HALANDRI, HALANDRI \u2013 DOUKISSIS PLAKENTIAS, 5.9 km in total, and DOUKISSIS PLAKENTIAS \u2013 AIRPORT were commissioned. In August 2004, SEPOLIA \u2013 AGHIOS ANTONIOS Metro Extension, 1.4km long, was commissioned. Another seven (7) stations, 8.5km long in total, namely ILIOUPOLI, ALIMOS, ARGYROUPOLI, ELLINIKO, PERISTERI, ANTHOUPOLI and AGHIA MARINA were handed over to the public in 2013. Currently, the most important transportation mode in Athens extends over 39 km, includes 36 modern stations and provides its services to 968,000 passengers on a daily basis., 41671=\u0391\u03a4\u03a4\u0399\u039a\u039f \u039c\u0395\u03a4\u03a1\u039f \u0391.\u0395. \u00a92007 All rights reserved Powered by Osmium\u2122 |\u00a0Creative Marketing S.A.}",
