            "CHARGED-PARTICLE BEAM WRITING METHOD - The present invention provides an electron beam writing method capable of suppressing a variation in position to be irradiated with an electron beam due to its drift and writing a predetermined pattern.",
            "CHARGED-PARTICLE BEAM WRITING APPARATUS AND CHARGED-PARTICLE BEAM WRITING METHOD - A timing control circuit controls the timing for applying a voltage to a sub deflector when changing a position to be irradiated with the charged-particle beam. A control computer compares a target line width and a line width of a pattern written with the timing for applying voltage to the sub deflector changed, and determines appropriate timing for applying voltage to the sub deflector from a timing range corresponding to a predetermined allowable range of the difference between the target line width and the line width of the written pattern. The control computer then controls the timing control circuit based on the determined timing.",

            "Lithography method of electron beam - A charged particle beam writing method on a chemical amplification type resist, comprising: coating said chemical amplification type resist which contains an acid diffusion inhibitor, on a surface of a mask substrate, exposing charged particle beams to said chemical amplification type resist layer on said surface of the mask substrate, baking said chemical amplification type resist layer which said charged particle beams were exposed, and developing said chemical amplification type resist after the baking, wherein an exposure current density of said electron beams exposing ranges of 50",
            "METHOD OF DETERMINING MAIN DEFLECTION SETTLING TIME FOR CHARGED PARTICLE BEAM WRITING, METHOD OF WRITING WITH CHARGED PARTICLE BEAM, AND APPARATUS FOR WRITING WITH CHARGED PARTICLE BEAM - An electron beam is moved a long distance along a straight line from a sub-deflection region",
            "ACQUISITION METHOD OF CHARGED PARTICLE BEAM DEFLECTION SHAPE ERROR AND CHARGED PARTICLE BEAM WRITING METHOD - An acquisition method of a charged particle beam deflection shape error includes writing a plurality of figure patterns, each smaller than a deflection region of a plurality of deflection regions, with charged particle beams, at a pitch different from an arrangement pitch of the plurality of deflection regions to be deflected by a deflector that deflects the charged particle beams, synthesizing writing positions of the plurality of figure patterns into one virtual deflection region of the same size as the deflection region, based on a positional relationship between the deflection region including a position where a figure pattern concerned of the plurality of figure patterns has been written and the position where the figure pattern concerned has been written, and calculating, to output, a shape error in the case of writing a pattern in the deflection region, using a synthesized writing position of each of the plurality of figure patterns.",
            "METHOD FOR ACQUIRING SETTLING TIME - A method for acquiring a settling time according to an embodiment, includes writing a plurality of first patterns, arranged in positions apart from each other by a deflection movement amount, by using a DAC amplifier in which a settling time of the DAC amplifier is set to a first time to be a sufficient settling time; writing a plurality of second patterns, in a manner where corresponding first and second patterns are in a position adjacent, for each second time of different second times containing the sufficient settling time set as variable; measuring a width dimension of each of a plurality of combined patterns after adjacent first and second patterns are combined for the each second time set as variable; and acquiring the settling time of the DAC amplifier needed for deflection by the deflection movement amount, using the width dimensions.",
            "SETTLING TIME ACQUISITION METHOD - A settling time acquisition method includes writing at least one reference pattern formed by at least one shot of a charged particle beam, writing an evaluation pattern, which has been formed by combination of the first and second shots of a charged particle beam shaped to first and second patterns of different sizes and whose width size is the same as that of the reference pattern, while changing, concerning beam shaping of the second shot, a settling time of a DAC amplifier, wherein writing is performed for each settling time, measuring the width size of the reference pattern, measuring the width size of the evaluation pattern for each settling time, calculating, for each settling time, a difference between the width sizes of the reference and evaluation patterns, and acquiring a settling time from each settling time of the DAC amplifier when the difference is not exceeding a threshold value."
