            "Description",
            "The ABGPS, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and raw scans are collected during the LiDAR aerial survey. The ABGPS monitors the xyz position of the sensor and the IMU monitors the orientation. During the aerial survey laser pulses reflected from features on the ground surface are detected by the receiver optics and collected by the data logger. GPS locations are based on data collected by receivers on the aircraft and base stations on the ground. The ground base stations are placed no more than 35 km radius from the flight survey area.",
            "The ABGPS, IMU, and raw scans are integrated using proprietary software developed by the Leica Geosystems and delivered with the Leica ALS50 System. The resultant file is in a LAS binary file format. The LAS file version 1.0 format can be easily transferred from one file format to another. It is a binary file format that maintains information specific to the LiDAR data (return#, intensity value, xyz, etc.). The resultant points are produced in the State Plane Florida West coordinate system, with units in feet and referenced to the NAD83 horizontal datum and NAVD88 vertical datum.",
            "The unedited data are classified to facilitate the application of the appropriate feature extraction filters. A combination of proprietary filters is applied as appropriate for the production of bare earth digital terrain models (DTMs). Interactive editing methods are applied to those areas where it is inappropriate or impossible to use the feature extraction filters, based upon the design criteria and/or limitations of the relevant filters. These same feature extraction filters are used to produce elevation height surfaces.",
            "Filtered and edited data are subjected to rigorous QA/QC according to the 3001 Inc. Quality Control Plan and procedures. Very briefly, a series of quantitative and visual procedures are employed to validate the accuracy and consistency of the filtered and edited data. Ground control is established by 3001, Inc. and GPS-derived ground control points (GCPs) points in various areas of dominant and prescribed land cover. These points are coded according to landcover, surface material and ground control suitability. A suitable number of points are selected for calculation of a statistically significant accuracy assessment as per the requirements of the National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy. A spatial proximity analysis is used to select edited lidar data points within a specified distance of the relevant GCPs. A search radius decision rule is applied with consideration of terrain complexity, cumulative error and adequate sample size. Accuracy validation and evaluation is accomplished using proprietary software to apply relevant statistical routines for calculation of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA) according to Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) specifications.",
            "The LiDAR mass points were delivered in American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing LAS 1.0 format. The header file for each dataset is complete as define by the LAS 1.0 specification. In addition the following fields are included: Flight Date Julian, Year, and Class. The LAS files do not include overlap. The data was classified as follows: Class 1 = Unclassified. This class includes vegetation, buildings, noise etc. Class 2 = Ground Class 3 = Water The datasets were delivered in the Districts standard 5000' by 5000' tiling scheme. The tiles are contiguous and do not overlap. The tiles are suitable for seamless topographic data mosaics that include no \"no data\" areas. The names of the tiles are left padded with zeros as required to achieve a five character length and all files utilize the LAS file extension.",
            "The NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) received the files in LAS format. The files contained Lidar elevation measurements. The data was in Florida State Plane Projection and NAVD88 vertical datum. CSC performed the following processing to the data to make it available within the LDART Retrieval Tool (LDART): 1. The data were converted from Florida State Plane West coordinates to geographic coordinates. 2. The data were converted from NAVD88 (orthometric) heights to GRS80 (ellipsoid) heights using Geoid 99. 3. The LAS data were sorted by latitude and the headers were updated.",
            "The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) received lidar data files via ftp transfer from the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The data are currently being served via NOAA CSC Digital Coast at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. The data can be used to re-populate the system. The data are archived in LAS or LAZ format. The LAS format is an industry standard for LiDAR data developed by the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS); LAZ is a loseless compressed version of LAS developed by Martin Isenburg (http://www.laszip.org/). The data are exclusively in geographic coordinates (either NAD83 or ITRF94). The data are referenced vertically to the ellipsoid (either GRS80 or ITRF94), allowing for the ability to apply the most up to date geoid model when transforming to orthometric heights."
