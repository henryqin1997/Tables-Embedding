SUMMARY STEPS Determination of whether the domain should be inward or outward. Assignment of maintenance levels and names to domains based on agreement between the service provider and operator or operators. Determination of the nesting and disjoint maintenance domains. Determination of the number of maintenance domains in the network. Agreement by all organizational entities on the responsibilities, roles, and restrictions for each organizational entity. Understanding of the type and scale of services to be offered. Understanding of organizational entities involved in managing the network; for example, operators, service providers, network operations centers (NOCs), and customer service centers. Knowledge and understanding of the network topology. Before You Begin",

Three domains are to be established to map to each operator and the service provider. In this example, for simplicity we assume that the network uses Ethernet transport end to end.
