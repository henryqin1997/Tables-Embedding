    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Chemeketa is a great school for anyone and everyone. Everybody is welcome to be who they are and there is never a need to put on a fake smile. The location is great and the classes are smaller. The teachers will be there to help you if you want or need it. Other students are eager to meet people. Chemeketa is an amazing place to be. Tips for prospective students I'd say take classes that appeal to you or to your major if you know. Chemeketa is a really friendly place and a great place to meet friends, hang out to get some extra studying done, or help with resource centers. Always do what you need to get done early, that goes with any college or comminty college. You don't want to be waiting in a line for an hour. Bang for the buck I was surprised at Chemeketa's prices. I know that being a community college it will be less than a university but I was impressed. Up in the financial aid offices there are packets that you can get a month or so pior to the next term with scholarships you can apply for and it's amazing. You really get what you pay for. Am",
