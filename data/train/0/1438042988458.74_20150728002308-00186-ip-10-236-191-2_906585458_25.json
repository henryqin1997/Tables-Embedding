This college is for students who are looking to stay at home, because it is so close. Tips for prospective students I would say go to this to do your generals, so that you do not waste your money at an expensive school. And then just transfer to the college you want to graduate from after your general credis are done. Bang for the buck Anoka Ramsey Communtiy College is one of the cheapest colleges in Minnesota.A semester can cost two thousand dollars for 14 credits. Am enjoying being here Since, this college offers PSEO to high school students, there are a lot of juniors and seniors that attend, which I think takes away from the college experience. Am learning a lot The classes that are given at Anoka Ramsey Community College are as top notch as any university. There is also a lot to do, like the multi-cultural club and psychology club.
