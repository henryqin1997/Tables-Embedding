            "Participants inadequately controlled on background metformin (MET) were randomised to receive rosiglitazone (RSG), in addition to MET. RSG was initiated as a 4 mg once daily dose and was increased to a maximum dose of 8 mg per day as required to achieve a target HbA1c of less than or equal to 7.0 percent.",
            "Participants inadequately controlled on background MET were randomised to receive, in addition to MET, a sulfonylurea (SU) (glibenclamide, gliclazide, or glimepiride). The SU was gradually increased to the maximum permitted dose (glibenclamide 15 mg per day or micronized equivalent of 10.5 mg per day; gliclazide 240 mg per day; glimepiride 4 mg per day) as required to achieve a target HbA1c of less than or equal to 7.0 percent.",

OFU was designed to collect cancer and bone fracture data. Participants were not provided with study medication in the OFU. Data are presented for the entire study (RECORD + OBF) and for OFU alone in the observational OMs. Significant events and approaches for the overall study following participant enrollment, but prior to group assignment Pre-Assignment Details The RECORD study ran from April 2001 through December 2008. Results are presented in the non-re-adjudicated outcome measures (OMs). An independent patient-level re-adjudication of mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke began on January 2011 and ran through March 2012.
