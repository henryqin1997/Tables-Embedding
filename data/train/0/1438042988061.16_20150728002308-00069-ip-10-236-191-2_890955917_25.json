            "Campus is very safe. There is always and RA to turn to for help if you need it. I've used the safe walk program a few times myself, where I called a number and the night guards escorted me through a dark parking lot or back to my dorm in situations I did not feel safe in. The doors to the dorms also lock at a certain time so that you don't have to worry about strangers walking around the dorms late at night. All in all it is a very safe campus.",
            "I don't know a lot about the Greek life on campus. I know a lot of people who are in Fraternities and Sororities, but am not knowledgeable on the subject.",
            "There is such a wide variety of clubs! Knitting, boxing, running, coloring, and dance are just a few. There are also lots of club sports such as waterpolo, volleyball, rugby, hockey, and more!",
            "This school is great for anyone! If you don't like snow or cold then winter might be a little rough though. Remember to pack your warm clothes!",
            "My friends and I jumped off the Ice Box at Canal Park our first weekend on campus. It is an abandoned building on Lake Superior that you swim a short distance to and jump into the Lake from. Although it was cold it was tons of fun! We stopped at Grandma's for a bite to eat after so it was well worth it!",
            "Most Definatly! The experiences and educational opprotunities UMD provides is worth every dollar.",
            "There is so much to do! On campus there are hundreds of clubs and sports to be a part of. Everything from coloring club to club hockey is available. There are intramural sports such as volleyball, curling, floor hockey, soccer, and others available all year. There is also pool tables all over campus, ping pong tables, and other lounges to just relax in. There is a desk where one can rent movies. You can go hiking down to the beautiful Chester Park or Bagley Nature Area. Duluth itself offers a plethora of options, casinos, Canal Park and Park Point (both right on Lake Superior!), Engar Tower, movie theaters, shopping, Adventure Zone where one can go swimming, play laser tag or others. There are also lots of places for you and your friends to hang out and relax. Most places offer student discounts too so you can go have fun at discount price!",
            "The cafeteria food is really good sometimes and OK others. However, there is LOTS of variety (salad cart, sand which bar, burger bar, vegetarian options, soups, the hot meal stations, ect.). There are some restaurants and coffee shops on campus that are really great! The coffee shop is especially awesome (the red velvet cupcakes are the best). There is also a Greek restaurant, a burger hub, an Italian restaurant, and others. It is also very easy to order a pizza or jimmy john's right to campus.",
            "The dorms are awesome to live in! They are connected to the rest of campus by a tunnel system so you don't have to go outside on those frigid winter days. You meet a ton of friends in the dorms and there's lots of activities to do! The resident advisors can be strict with the rules sometimes, but they have a job to do and they can get in trouble themselves for not enforcing certain rules so keep that in mind!",
            "The professors are generally understanding about coursework and exam schedules, but they also have a schedule to keep too. It's the same at any college, if you want to do well you have to put in the work, there's still plenty of time for fun though!",
            "Get your applications in early! This determines which dorms you will live in, the sooner you get your application in the better chance you have for better housing. Don't be afraid to ask questions! The people are there to help you get the best experience poosible, it's their job.",
            "Attending the University of Minnesota- Duluth was the best decision I have ever made. It is in a fantastic location, I have a beautiful view of Lake Superior right from my dorm; the staff and people are all friendly, helpful, and want you to achieve, and the campus is beautiful, there is always something to do so there is never an excuse for getting bored. All in all- it is a great school!"

Watch out for the potential health plan that the school adds onto your tuition bill if you don't show proof of insurance. A lot of my friends were out $1000-2000 until they realized they were added to the plan and got out of it, which isn't possible after the first few weeks., 308478=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 305205=To be certain UMD is the right college for you a campus tour is very helpful. Don't be concerned with the cold Minnesotan weather, dorms are connected to the campus via a heated sky walk so flip-flops and shorts are often worn year round. Plenty of UMD scholarships are available to apply for before May of each year., 107955=The Dining Center's foods average at best (and utterly mysterious sometimes). There's an ice cream machine too but it's normally broken down or the ice cream is bad. The hours are from 7:30 to 7:30 which isn't good. The coffee shop has great atmosphere though it's weekend hours aren't anything to brag about (it's closed on sunday). There also is a Food court with a 50's themed burger place, an italian and a sub place. The only one open until 10 would the the italian place otherwise everything else's hours vary widely.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students UMD is great for someone who loves the outdoors, football (national champs!) and hockey (men's and women's teams are outstanding). Although Duluth has nasty winters, you wont need to go outside between classes because everything is connected by a concourse system ;) Tips for prospective students Apply early, and turn in your housing deposit early! Meet people and get involved, I missed out on a lot first semester because I did not join many clubs. Bang for the buck I have not compared tuition, but its likely just as costly as any other liberal arts college. Am enjoying being here Duluth is a great city and dorm life is comfortable. I am however transferring to a smaller city only because I personally desire a smaller college. Am learning a lot Most the instructors I've had were great. Many interesting courses are offered and I've enjoyed most of my classes. Login to rate or flag the reviews Kaitlyn from Park Rapids, MN",
