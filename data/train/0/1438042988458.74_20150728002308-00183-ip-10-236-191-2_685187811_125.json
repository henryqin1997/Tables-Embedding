Since the performance targets set forth in the share transfer agreement have been met, the option has vested and become exercisable to Mr. Ren. As a result, the number of shares of beneficial ownership has included 1,106,903 shares of common stock that have become transferrable to Mr. Ren after adjusting proportionally to the reduction of total number of shares held by Expert Venture Limited since April 2010., 432374=For our Corn Division, the portion of revenues derived from new or small customers has increased and the overall number of customers also increased. For our Grain Division, our customers are diversified among distributors and chain of supermarkets. For our Bulk Trading Division, a newly-added business in the fourth quarter of 2010, we have established stable relationships with Tianjin Yimingda Grain Division (a wholesaler), which is one of our largest customers and accounts for 28.3% of gross sales of Bulk Trading Division. We believe we can continue to keep stable relationships with existing customers and enlarge our customer base in the future., 400327=Lastly, pursuant to the Securities Escrow Agreement, our majority shareholder (which is also the selling stockholder in this prospectus, Expert Venture Limited) pledged 2,455,863 shares of\u00a0common stock of the Company (the \u201cMake Good Shares\u201d) to secure the obligation that we reach certain earnings thresholds for the fiscal years ended 2010 and 2011.\u00a0\u00a0Since the Make Good Shares have already been issued to Expert Venture Limited, any transfer of the shares pursuant to the terms of the Make Good Agreement will not cause any dilution to existing shareholders.

For the fiscal year 2010, we met our threshold requirement of reporting net income of at least 95% of $11,000,000. If we meet the threshold in 2011 of reporting net income of at least 95% of $15,000,000 (i.e., at least $14,250,000), the remainder of the Make Good Shares will be returned to Expert Venture Limited, however if we fail to meet our threshold, then the Make Good Shares will be released from escrow based on the following terms and conditions:, 686574=Dongsheng International Investment Co., Ltd., the President and Executive Director of which is Wenjun Tian, the Company's President and a Director, loaned the Company in the aggregate amount of $2.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2011.\u00a0 Such loan is unsecured, bears no interest and no due date is specified.\u00a0 As of December 31, 2011 and March 28, 2012, $2.9 million and $2.5 million were due under this loan, respectively., 1607=REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, 21956=This prospectus relates to the sale of up to 250,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, which may be offered by the selling stockholder from time to time. All of the shares of common stock offered by this prospectus are being sold by the selling stockholder, and such shares consist of shares which had been previously issued by us to the selling stockholder on April 27, 2010 pursuant to a share exchange transaction. Such registration does not mean that the selling stockholder will actually offer or sell any of these shares. We will not receive any proceeds from the sales of shares of our common stock by the selling stockholder., 299640=Gross profit in Corn Division was $29.4 million, contributing to 68.2% of total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2011.\u00a0\u00a0Gross margin for our Corn Division was 16.5% for the year ended December 31, 2011, down by 560 basis points from 22.1% for the year ended December 31, 2010.\u00a0The decrease of gross margin was mainly due to the continuous increase in the purchase price of raw corn and supplemental procurement from suppliers. The purchase price of raw corn increased by about 12% during the year ended December 31, 2011, but the selling price did not increase consistently. Due to our rapid growth in corn sales, we supplemented the supply of raw materials from farmers by purchasing from other corn traders, of which the purchasing price was usually higher and it negatively affected the gross margin of the Corn Division., 229651=In the fourth quarter of 2011, we adjusted the structure of our business divisions in order to better allocate resources and to assess the performance of the group according to our growth strategy. Our Deep Processed Division was dissolved because of the termination of our control agreements with the VIE Group on December 20, 2011, which conducted most of the business of our Deep Processed Division. We changed the name of our Simple Processed Grain Division to the Grain Division, which conducts processed grain products being sold through our retail sales network. With the rapid growth of our bulk trading business, we set up a new division called the Bulk Trading Division, the activities of which were previously conducted in the Grain Division. We now have three business divisions: the Corn Division, the Grain Division and the Bulk Trading Division. According to FASB Accounting Standard Codification Topic 280, we prepared the financial information for these segments for the year ended December 31, 2011 and restated the comparable information for the year ended December 31, 2010., 692405=On January 13, 2010, Jinzhong Deyu provided a two year guarantee on a $1.3 million short-term bank loan payable to Jinzhong Economic Development District Rural Credit Union by Jingzhong Yuliang, bearing interest at a floating rate of prime rate plus 129.83% of prime rate, of which prime rate was based on the six-month to one-year loan interest rate released by The People's Bank of China.\u00a0 The loan was originally due March 8, 2011.\u00a0 In January 2011, the Company entered into an agreement with the bank for an extension and the new term was from February 1, 2011 to October 1, 2011.\u00a0 The adjustable interest rate was a rate per annum equal to the prime rate plus 117.23% of prime rate.\u00a0 The prime rate was based on the one to three year loan interest rate released by The People's Bank of China.\u00a0 The loan was fully paid off on May 11, 2011, with Jingzhong Yuliang paying the principal amount of $1.3 million plus $8,865 in accrued interest., 782294=West Coast Stock Transfer is currently the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock.

To the extent applicable, Regulation M may also restrict the ability of any person engaged in the distribution of the shares of common stock to engage in market-making activities with respect to the shares of common stock. All of the foregoing may affect the marketability of the shares of common stock and the ability of any person or entity to engage in market-making activities with respect to the shares of common stock., 121888=The PRC legal system is a civil law system. Unlike the common law system, the civil law system is based on written statutes in which decided legal cases have little value. In 1979, the PRC began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and has since introduced many laws and regulations to provide general guidance on economic and business practices in the PRC and to regulate foreign investment. Progress has been made in the promulgation of laws and regulations dealing with economic matters such as corporate organization and governance, foreign investment, commerce, taxation and trade. The promulgation of new laws, changes of existing laws and the abrogation of local regulations by national laws could have a negative impact on our business and business prospects., 146894=The Foreign Investment Industrial Catalogue jointly issued by the Ministry of Commerce for the People\u2019s Republic of China and the National Development and Reform Commission in 2011 classified various industries/business into three different categories: (i) encouraged for foreign investment; (ii) restricted to foreign investment; and (iii) prohibited from foreign investment. For any industry/business not covered by any of these three categories, they will be deemed industries/business permitted to have foreign investment. Except for those expressly provided restrictions, encouraged and permitted industries/business are usually 100% open to foreign investment and ownership. With regard to those industries/business restricted to or prohibited from foreign investment, there is always a limitation on foreign investment and ownership. The PRC Subsidiary\u2019s business does not fall under the industry categories that are restricted to, or prohibited from foreign investment and is not subject to limitation on foreign investment and ownership., 1077108=The Company's inventories are stated at lower of cost or market.\u00a0\u00a0Cost is determined on moving-average basis.\u00a0\u00a0Costs of inventories include purchase and related costs incurred in delivering the products to their present location and condition.\u00a0\u00a0Market value is determined by reference to selling prices after the balance sheet date or to management\u2019s estimates based on prevailing market conditions.\u00a0\u00a0Management periodically evaluates the composition of its inventories at least quarterly to identify slow-moving and obsolete inventories to determine if valuation allowance is required.\u00a0\u00a0As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, management had identified no slow moving or obsolete inventory.
