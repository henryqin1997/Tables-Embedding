            "The campus is safe. There is a campus police in the main building and there is always a policemen outside roaming around the parking lots to give out tickets to parking violators. There is no fighting at the campus, mostly because there are adults there and so everyone is expected to behave like such.",
            "There is no greek life at EPCC.",
            "There are too many clubs to count at this school! Some of the ones that really stand out would be Theatre club and Geology Team.",
            "If you work part time and have kids or just out of high school, this college is the absolute best. Your teachers can work with you if you have emergencies and almost all of the assignments you need to catch up on can be found online with the days lecture!",
            "The classes are worth it. Tuition is going up everywhere and EPCC is just way more affordable than a 4 year university.",
            "There are so many different clubs and student activities on campus. The student governement holds all sorts of special events at the campus that sometimes allow the student to win cool prizes like a Nook or a Kindle. We can also play pool and foosball in the main building.",
            "There is a lady who cooks for the school, her name is Conchita! She has the best food you could possibly imagine. It might be a bit pricey at times, but worth every penny. There are also vending machines with healthy snack and plenty of beverage vending machines.",
            "EPCC does not have dorms on campus because everyone lives so close to it anyway, it's just easy to get to.",
            "There are teachers who try to get you excited about the course your taking and they lecture as though their life depended on it! The rigor is not so hard, but at times very tedious. To pass most of the classes you have to make sure you study and if your teacher gives you study reviews, then you will need them.",
            "You should always register for classes as soon as registration begins because if you wait last minute, you might not get the classes you need. The library is one of the best spots to study because its spacious and really quiet. Getting to school early is always better if you want to find close parking.",
            "The campus is small, so it's easy to get to all of my classes on time. There are so many different courses and a great advisor team to help me chose which ones are best for me. All of my teachers are ambitious and it's easy for me to follow along in class."

Don't let them look at your transcripts (if you are a transfer) and then just say you need to take certain classes. Make sure they sit down with you and give you an actual plan that you can follow. They didn't do that with me and I was planning on graduating in the Fall of 2013 so I could transfer to another state with an associates, and come to find out they were giving me the wrong classes towards my degree. I spoke with a counselor and was told I was still 5 classes short. I never saw the same counselor twice, so I was getting conflicting information all the time., 409672=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Campus Safety The College has its own police department which is always rounding around the college parking and buildings. In the years that I have attended this college I have not had any problems regarding this. I feel safe, even when I take night classes. Clubs and Activities There are many clubs and activities going on during the semesters. They have the Honors Program, SGA (Student Government Association), Phi Theta Kappa club and many activities. Some activities promote physical health, like \u2018Race for the Cure,\u2019 and some are to help the least fortunate like food donations. Other activities are for students, for example Art Festivals and Art exhibitions. These are competition among students; the winner either gets money, a lap tops, an iPad etc. Great for these types of students Once again it is great for those students who are not eligible for financial aid, and have to pay full price for the tuition. It offers payment plans and classes are very affordable. It is also great for those who want to get the basics out of the way as fast as they can, and not have too much pressure from teachers. Most of the teachers in this College are very flexible with the students and very understanding. Share any",
