    "textAfterTable": "Usage Guidelines The terminating-pe tie-breaker command is used in Layer 2 pseudowire routing configuration mode. To enter Layer 2 pseudowire routing configuration mode, use the l2 pseudowire routing command. Active and Passive PEs in an L2VPN VPLS Inter-AS Option B Configuration A TPE terminates a multisegment pseudowire. By default, the TPEs on both ends of a multisegmented pseudowire are in active mode. The L2VPN VPLS Inter-AS Option B feature requires that one of the TPEs be in passive mode. The system determines which PE is the passive TPE based on a comparison of the Target Attachment Individual Identifier (TAII) received from Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and the Source Attachment Individual Identifier (SAII) of the local router. The TPE with the numerically higher identifier assumes the active role. When you are configuring the PEs for the L2VPN VPLS Inter-AS Option B feature, use the terminating-pe tie-breaker command to negotiate the mode of the TPE. Then use the mpls ldp discovery targeted-hello accept command to ensure that a passive TPE can accept Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) sessions from the LDP peers. Examples In the following example, the terminating-pe command has been used to configure the TPE to negotiate an active or passive role:  Router>enable Router# configure terminal Router(config)# l2 pseudowire routing Router(config-l2_pw_rtg)#",
