Louw's main home has been Northamptonshire, but he also had a year with Middlesex in 2006. He has been a consistent performer in all formats, however has proved especially productive in one-day cricket. During some seasons he has been registered under the Kolpak banner, but in 2008 was Northamptonshire's official overseas signing. Any future county assignments will now have to come through that route if he goes onto make his ODI debut against Kenya. He is a more than useful batsman with a first-class average in the low 20s.
