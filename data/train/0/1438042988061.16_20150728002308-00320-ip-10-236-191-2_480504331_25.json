    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{152574=Assume that the following grammar rules 206 exist in accordance with the invention:, 47350=The parser of the system includes a grammar database. The parser finds all possible interpretations of a sentence using grammatical rules. The grammar database consists of a series of context-free phrase structure rules of the form X=A1 A2 . . . An. X is composed of, or made from, A1 A2 . . . An and is referred to as a higher node of lower nodes (subnodes) A1 through An., 69620=Feature match restrictions are broken into \u201clocal\u201d and \u201clong distance\u201d. The long distance actions may be computed when the grammar is compiled, rather than when actually processing a sentence. The sequence of long distance operations that must be performed is then encoded in a series of instruction bytes., 52788=Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, an automated natural language translation system 10 according to the invention includes an input interface 12, a translation engine 16, storage 18, a user input device 22, a display 20, and an output interface 14. The input interface is constructed to receive a sequence of text in a source language, such as English or Japanese. The input interface may comprise a keyboard, a voice interface, or a digital electronic interface, such as a modem or a serial input. The translation engine performs translation operations on the source text, in conjunction with data in storage. The translation engine may be comprised entirely of hardwired logic circuitry, or it may contain one or more processing units and associated stored instructions. The engine may include the following elements, or parts of them: A preparser 24, a parser 26, a graph maker 28, a parse/translation evaluator 30, a parse extractor 32, a structural converter 34, and a user interface 42, which includes an alternate parse system 37. The structural converter may comprise a grammar rule controlled structural converter 36, a lexicon controlled structural converter 38, and a synthesis rule controlled structural converter 40. The storage 18 may include one or more areas of disk (e.g., hard, floppy, and/or optical) and/or memory (e.g., RAM) storage, or the like. It may store the following elements, in whole or in part: a base dictionary 44, technical dictionaries 46, user-created dictionaries, grammar rules 48, synthesis rules 50, a semantic feature tree 52, structure trees 54, and a graph 56. The storage 18 also is used to store input textual information in a source natural language, output textual information in a target natural language, and all sorts of information used or useful in performing the translation including one or more dictionaries, domain keywords, and grammar rules. The user input interface 22 may comprise a keyboard, a mouse, touchscreen, light pen, or other user input device, and is to be used by the operator of the system. The display may be a computer display, printer or other type of display, or it may include other means of communicating information to the operator. The output interface 14 communicates a final translation of the source text in the target language, such as Japanese. The interface may comprise a printer, a display, a voice interface, an electronic interface, such as a modem or serial line, or it may include other means for communicating that text to the end user., 123099=As shown, with the invention, the dictionary needs only one stem for each verb and there is only one set of suffixes. Thus, the economization of grammar rules and dictionary organization in accordance with the invention has been described., 30273=The automated natural language translation system according to the invention has many advantages over known machine-based translators. After the system automatically selects the best possible translation of the input textual information and provides the user with an output (preferably a Japanese language translation of English-language input text), the user can then interface with the system to edit the displayed translation or to obtain alternative translations in an automated fashion. An operator of the automated natural language translation system of the invention can be more productive because the system allows the operator to retain just the portion of the translation that he or she deems acceptable while causing the remaining portion to be retranslated automatically. Since this selective retranslation operation is precisely directed at portions that require retranslation, operators are saved the time and tedium of considering potentially large numbers of incorrect, but highly ranked translations. Furthermore, because the system allows for arbitrary granularity in translation adjustments, more of the final structure of the translation will usually have been generated by the system The system thus reduces the potential for human (operator) error and saves time in edits that may involve structural accord, and tense changes. The system efficiently gives operators the full benefit of its extensive and reliable knowledge of grammar and spelling., 68701=The system also performs feature matching of linguistic features. Linguistic features are properties of words and other constituents. Syntactic feature matching is used by the parser, and semantic feature matching is used by the graph maker. But the same techniques are used for both. For instance, \u201cthey\u201d has the syntactic feature plural, while \u201che\u201d has the feature of singular. Feature matching uses marking on grammar rules so that they only apply if the features of the words they are to apply to meet certain conditions. For example, one rule might be:, 64403=The semantic propagation part of the system operates to propagate semantic information from smaller constituents to the larger constituents they comprise. It applies to four classes of the syntactic categories used in the earlier parsing operation: SEMNP (which includes noun-like objects and prepositional phrases), SEMVP (verb phrase like objects, which usually take subjects), SEMADJ (adjectives) and VERB (lexical verb-like verbs that often take objects). Other syntactic categories are ignored within a rule. The grammar rule author may also override the implicit behavior below by specific markings on rules. These specific instructions are followed first., 87538=the system of the invention uses grammar rules of the following format:, 73187=Referring to FIG. 8, operation of the expert evaluator 30 is based on various factors that characterize each translation, which are handled by the various experts. The rule probability expert 170 evaluates the average relative frequency of grammar rules used to obtain the initial source language parse tree. The selectional restriction expert 178 evaluates the degree of semantic accord of the given translation. The dictionary entry probability expert 172 evaluates the average relative frequency of particular \u201cparts of speech\u201d of the words in the sentence used to obtain the initial source language parse tree. The statistics expert evaluates the average relative frequency of particular paraphrases chosen for the given translation., 85255=If a sentence contains a sequence of initial-uppercase words, it can be treated as a proper name or as a sequence of ordinary nouns. The system of the invention employs a capitalized sequence procedure, which favors the former interpretation. Also, if the sequence cannot itself be parsed by normal grammar rules, it can be treated as a single unanalyzed noun phrase to be passed through untranslated. This procedure has proven to be a very effective way of dealing with multiple-word proper names while not completely ignoring the lower-rated common noun interpretations., 41590=In propagating linguistic information through the tree, the semantic propagation part of the system operates to propagate semantic information from smaller constituents to the larger constituents that they comprise. Semantic propagation applies to the four classes of syntactic categories (SEMNP, SEMVP, SEMADJ, and VERB) used in the parsing operation. Before semantic propagation can occur, the linguistic information stored at the nodes must be analyzed. The analysis of the semantic information stored at the nodes is guided by a set of rules that tell from examining the noun-like and verb-like constituents in a grammar rule which selectional restriction slots of the verb-like constituents apply to which noun-like objects. Gerald Gazdar discusses in his text Natural Language Processing In Prolog (Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., 1989) a set of rules which can be used to analyze the semantic information stored at the nodes in a directed acyclic graph similar to that disclosed in the specification. Gazdar discusses the use of feature matching to match information on adjacent nodes. Gazdar states that feature matching involves equations that say that certain, 145835=The parsing of the unsegmented input sentence is completed when a set of parses for the sentence is obtained. In each parse, matched dictionary entries (i.e., \u201cmulti-word idioms\u201d) represent morphemes. Thus, morphological analysis of the input string is completed concurrent with the completion of the parsing of the string with grammar rules., 28191=In grammar-rule-based structural conversion, the domain of structural conversion is limited to the domain of grammar rules that have been used to obtain the source-language parse tree (i.e., to a set of subnodes that are immediate daughters of a given node). For example, given, 26516=This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/938,413 which was filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Aug. 31, 1992 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,528,491. This also is a continuation-in-part of international patent application No. PCT/US96/05567 which was filed with the U.S. Receiving Office on Apr. 23, 1996 via the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) designating Japan and the U.S. PCT/US96/05567 is itself a continuation-in-part of Ser. No. 07/938,413., 99382=As indicated previously, the kana-kanji-romaji representation of Japanese sentences economizes the grammar rules and the dictionary organization needed by the system to perform the Japanese-to-English translation. The following is an explanation of that economization. Table 2 gives an example of a partial paradigm of verb inflections in Japanese, where the verbs write, extinguish, stand, and die are used in the example., 118931=According to this second alternative, it is necessary to enter only one stem form for each verb. On the other hand, eleven sets of inflectional endings (e.g., the Type.K set, Type.S set, etc.) will have to be recognized, and the grammar rules need to specify which of these sets can follow which of the stem types. Since a given Japanese verb can inflect in several hundred ways, the grammar rules with respect to which stem types can combine with which suffix types can get extremely complex., 85847=Referring to FIG. 7, the machine translation system of the invention uses a grammar-rule controlled structural conversion mechanism 162 that has the efficiency of a straightforward grammar-rule-based structural conversion method, but which comes close to the power of the template-to-template structural conversion method. This method relies on the use of grammar rules 160 which can specify non-flat complex substructure. While the following is a rule format used in other translation systems:, 93285=The grammar rules and dictionary organization can be greatly economized (as explained hereinafter) when it is recognized that the string in (1) consists of the following morphemes, where a morpheme boundary is designated by a hyphen and where the organization of a dictionary 200 is given in Table 1:, 65085=There are two aspects to the manner in which semantic features are propagated through the system. The first is a set of rules that tell from examining the noun-like and verb-like constituents in a grammar rule, which selectional restriction slots of the verb-like constituents apply to which noun-like objects. For instance, the rule for the verb phrase of the sentence: \u201cI persuaded him to go\u201d is roughly VP=VT11+NP+VP (where VP is a verb phrase, VT11 is a type of transitive verb, and NP is a noun phrase). One exemplary default rule indicates that when a verb takes objects, selectional restrictions are to be applied to the first NP encountered to the right of the verb. Another rule says that VP restrictions on their subjects should be applied to the first NP found to the left of a VP. Together these rules make sure that \u201cpersuade him\u201d and \u201chim go\u201d are both evaluated for their semantic plausibility. As mentioned before, these rules reflect the complex grammar of the English language and there may therefore be quite a few of them., 75893=The parts of speech \u201cAdjectival Phrase\u201d and \u201cAdverbial Phrase\u201d are useful in the situation where an English sentence may have a different meaning depending on how a particular prepositional phrase is interpreted by the system. For example, the sentence \u201cWe need a book on the fourth of July\u201d means \u201cWe need a book about the American fourth of July holiday\u201d if \u201con the fourth of July\u201d has an adjectival interpretation, but the sentence means \u201cOn the fourth day of July, we need a book\u201d if the phrase \u201con the fourth of July\u201d has an adverbial interpretation. If the operator believes the system has automatically assigned the incorrect POS to \u201con the fourth of July\u201d, the operator can manually set a different POS to \u201con the fourth of July\u201d in the sentence \u201cWe need a book on the fourth of July\u201d. If an operator does not want the system to translate a particular word, phrase, or group of words from English to Japanese, the operator can assign the POS \u201cEnglish\u201d to the desired word(s), phrase(s), and/or group(s) of words. It also is possible for an operator to remove one or more POS settings, regardless whether the settings were assigned automatically by the system or manually by an operator., 147073=As described previously, in accordance with the invention, the grammar rules and dictionary organization can be greatly economized if it is recognized that the string contains the following morphemes:, 47778=The graph maker of the system graphically represents the many possible interpretations of a sentence. Each node of the graph corresponds to an export of some substring. In one embodiment of the system, a single export is represented by a single node. The graph contains arcs which emanate from the nodes associated with an export. The arcs represent the substructure of the export based on the application of grammar rules. The graph may depict at least two types of arcs: (1) a unary arc which points to a single different export of the same substring; (2) a binary arc which includes a pair of pointers which points to two exports, the substrings of which when concatenated form the substring of the original export. Note that the formulation described in (2) assumes a grammar in Chomsky normal form. Amended claim 35 applies to grammars not in Chomsky normal form by rephrasing type (2) to reflect an arc having an N-tuple of pointers, pointing to N exports., 154660=All of the above-described functions and operations may be implemented by a variety of hardwired logic design and/or programming techniques for use with a general purpose computer. The steps as presented in the flowcharts generally need not be applied in the order presented, and combinations of the steps may be combined. Similarly, the functionality of the system may be distributed into programs and data in various ways. Furthermore, it may be advantageous to develop the grammar and other operative rules in one or more high level languages, while supplying them to end users in a compiled format., 89247=Given this type of grammar, it becomes possible to specify multiple structure conversion among any sequences of nodes that are siblings in the substructure. This transforms a grammar-rule-based structure conversion mechanism into one with some of the power of the template-to-template structure conversion mechanism. Although the system of the invention is based on the second type of grammar rules presented above, it automatically compiles the corresponding grammar rules of the first form. It can therefore use grammar rules of the first form to parse sentences, and use grammar rules of the second form to build parse structures., 61122=Referring again to FIGS. 2 and 3, once the sentence boundaries have been defined by the preparser, the parser places the words of the sentence in syntactic categories, and applies grammar rules from the grammar database to them to compute possible syntactic interpretations 25 of the sentence (step 104). These grammar rules 48 can be implemented as a series of computer readable rules that express the grammatical constraints of the language. For the English language, there may be hundreds of such rules, which may apply to hundreds of syntactic categories. To reduce the computational overhead of this operation, the different possible meanings of a word are ignored., 61833=In the next step (step 106), the graph maker employs the dictionary to expand the results of the parser to include the different meanings of words and creates a directed acyclic graph representing all semantic interpretations of the sentence. This graph is generated with the help of a series of semantic propagation procedures, which are described below. These procedures operate on a series of authored grammar rules and, in some cases, access a semantic feature tree for semantic information. The semantic feature tree is a tree structure that includes semantic categories. It is roughly organized from the abstract to the specific, and permits the procedures to determine how semantically related a pair of terms are, both in terms of their separation in the tree and their levels in the tree. For example, \u201ccat\u201d and \u201cdog\u201d are more related than \u201ccat\u201d and \u201cpudding\u201d, and hence the former pair would be separated by a smaller distance within the tree. \u201cAnimal\u201d and \u201ccat\u201d are examples of words that are stored at different levels in the tree, as \u201canimal\u201d is a more abstract term than \u201ccat.\u201d}",
