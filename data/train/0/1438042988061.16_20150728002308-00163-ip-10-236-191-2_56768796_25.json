Starting at their own 31, Chicago got a pair of first downs to move the ball past midfield. Facing a 3rd-and-3, Cutler and Marshall got together on a 12-yard play and on the next snap, Cutler floated a pass down the right sideline and Jeffery came down with the ball for a 23-yard score to make it a 14-7 game with 1:52 to play before intermission., 75209=On Chicago's first touch, Cutler was picked off by Josh Robinson, who took it into the end zone from 49 yards out. The replay showed he was out at the 5- yard line, but Peterson took it in from a yard out three plays later for a 14-0 lead with 8:42 left in the first quarter.}",
