            "My favorite thing about security on this campus is their policy on safety while drinking. They will crack down on drinking if it is happening and poor decisions are being made, but if a student who has been drinking calls safety and security to alert them to a situation in which someone's health is a concern, they will not press the issue of drinking with that student or any others who were involved. The idea behind this is that it is better to have safe students than to let someone die of alcohol poisoning because students were too scared to fess up that they've been drinking.",
            "I don't know about 'clubs' per say, but the sci-fi themed hall is brilliant at acting like a huge fan club over almost anything nerdy.",
            "Hippies, hipsters, preps, liberals.",
            "There is a statue on the second floor of the main science building. This statue is regularly dressed up by the students for different times of year.",
            "While quite expensive, Oberlin is the best school around that's not the Ivy Leagues (which are even more expensive and don't offer financial aid). Oberlin is a well known school, so that when you tell people you got your degree from Oberlin, nine times out of ten they will be impressed.",
            "In a theme hall, there are almost always activities happening that (in most cases) anyone is welcome to join in on. If that doesn't suit your fancy though, walk out side with at least one friend and a Frisbee, and I guarantee at least two other people will join you. The entire campus is friendly and welcoming.",
            "The main dining hall, Stevenson, has food that is quite bland most of the time but occasionally scores a 10/5 with a dish, but it is the space (outside of co-ops) that has the most vegetarian/vegan options on campus, and second most vegetarian/vegan options in the country, not to mention the fact that it's all you can eat. Because of the bland flavor though, many students choose to eat at the other, smaller, cafeteria style dining hall in Dascomb, or in one of the many varied co-ops, which are always guaranteed palate pleasers, but require help with cooking or washing.",
            "There are three different varieties of dorms on campus: Traditional, themed, or co-op. Traditional housing is just like every other dorm in the american collegiate system. You can get a single, double, or quad with your choice of roommate(s), and you can live there for the semester or the academic year. The RA's may schedule events, but for the most part are just there to keep you safe. In themed living however, the RA's are much more likely (in fact, practically required) to schedule events based around the theme of the hall or house. In these halls, the students have a much closer bond with each other and their RA's. The last type of living, co-ops, are a completely different animal. In co-ops, the college doesn't provide you with anything except for the building, heating, plumbing, and electricity. The members of the co-op come up with everything else, including food. In this lifestyle, you are the most connected with your fellows because you all work together in order to live together.",
            "The courses at Oberlin are all very challenging in their own way as their primary purpose is to improve upon your existing skill level. If you ever find yourself falling short in a class, you may talk with the professor of the course and your academic adviser over the many options to help you succeed. Alternatively, if you feel ahead in a class (which rarely happens) you can talk to the professor of the next level class, and see if you can audit the course. by auditing that course, you may be applicable to move to the next level course for credit next semester. In short, Oberlin will always find the right place for you and make sure that you feel challenged while succeeding.",
            "In order to get accepted at Oberlin, you have to be top notch, or show them how much you want to be top notch. You also have to show them that you are well rounded, and passionate about your choice of school. The easiest way to do this is to make multiple visits to the college, and talk with the admissions people. Also, don't worry too much about the cash: Oberlin's need based grants are very well implemented so that you'll never be paying something outside of your price range.",
            "A small liberal arts school with large political ambitions, Oberlin is a school that continually produces leaders on numerous subjects and topics. Many of the teachers have written books that are the standard for teaching their subject nationwide, and they keep good track of how their words fall on their students with most professors handing out hand-made surveys at the end of each semester to improve themselves. Speaking of improving themselves, that's exactly the goal that every Oberlin student has come for, and the vast majority of them find their way wonderfully."

The commitment to the student is extremely clear. My private teacher gives above and beyond the requirements for his students with additional lessons each semester, and a technique class for each freshman. In addition, the guest lecturers and artists giving concerts are educationally and financially worth an incredible price. Oberlin Conservatory has more Steinway pianos than anywhere in the world excluding the Steinway factory. This speaks to the type of equipment and resources with which the students work. The Conservatory Library never ceases to amaze me with the unreal amount of resources it provides. In addition to this, the orchestra tours and experiences are included in tuition. This year's tour to NYC in January is of no cost to the students participating. Oberlin provides a plethora of resources, highly renown faculty and guests, and will bend over backwards to provide what you need for your learning experience. Although Oberlin's tuition is extraordinarily high, this price reflects the incredible experiences and opportunities that await its students.}",

I'm currently kicking it with the true liberal arts experience taking cinema classes, photography, computer programming, Literature courses, and still being able to find incredible opportunities to volunteer. Classes are small, so its easy to develop relationships with your professors and take much more from a class than you might on another campus.
