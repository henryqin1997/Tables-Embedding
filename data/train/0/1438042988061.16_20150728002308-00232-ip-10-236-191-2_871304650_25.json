In 1995, it was repackaged and expanded upon as Williams Arcade Classics for the PC.[2] DASArcade (written by David Alan Spicer) was arguably the first PC-based multiple arcade game emulator. This was distinct from Digital Eclipse's release in that only one program was required to emulate more than one arcade game, rather than one program per game. The first version of DASArcade was released later in 1995 and emulated a few titles including Pac-Man and Frogger (two years before MAME which now dominates arcade emulation). DASArcade evolved into Sparcade which emulates over 70 games.[3]}",

The most commonly used emulator and virtual arcade software is MAME and 3D Arcade. Most common Virtual Arcades can not play more than one ROM at a time which makes it near impossible to play a game that requires the player to run two ROMs at once.
