    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students The most important fact i've learned about this college is complete all of your homework and assignments, and be on task. Study for exams and do not wait for the last moment to want to complete your homework or study for an exam. Take it from me i know and I've learn from my mistakes. Tips for prospective students The most important tips is to be on time, do as your professor ask of you and if you are not sure ask the professor. Even if you need more time, most profesors have office hours. Some professors are even nice enough to take time away from there busy schedule just to help you out. Otherwise, if there office hours time doesn't fit your schedule, hey they even have a tutoring center that opens from 8am to 8pm from Mondays to Thursdays and Friday and Saturday have varies of times. Bang for the buck yes i feel like this school is great, especially for students like me, who are trying to persuade there career or need a second chance out in the academic life like i did. Am enjoying being here I enjoy being at this college.",
