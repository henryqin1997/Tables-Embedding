The disclosure of the prior application(s) is hereby incorporated by reference herein-in its entirety., 43853=In a further development of the traditional hybridization test, it was therefore proposed that a number of identical nucleotide sequences be bound with each probe. The hybrid consisting of analyte nucleic acid and probe was detected by hybridizing a number of secondary probes that were complementary to these identical nucleotide sequences. A number of documents that describe the prior art discuss the most favorable arrangement of the many identical nucleotide sequences in the probe or in a set consisting of probes that are capable of hybridizing\u2014and, therefore, aggregating\u2014with each other (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,424,188; EP-B-0 248 896 B1; U.S. Pat. No. 5,424,413; 5,437,977). It is stated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,424,188, for instance, that the identical nucleotide sequences can be attached to each other in linear fashion. The chain of identical nucleotide sequences produced can also be formed into a closed ring. It is stated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,124,246 that the identical nucleotide sequences can be bound to each other by means of a branched structure. A distinction is made in this case between fork-like branchings and comb-like branchings. A number of potential technical embodiments have been described for the branchings (Nucleic Acids Research 16/11, 4937-4965, Gene 61, 253-264, Nucleic Acids Research 17/17, 6959-6967, Clinical Chemistry 35/8, 1571-1575 (1989), Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters 4/8, 1011-1018 (1994), Nucleic Acids Research Symposium 24, 197-200 (1991), and Clin. Chem. 39/4, 725-726 (1993)). In WO 95/01365, a branching method is also described in which the lateral arms are bound to a special backbone by means of a reaction between phosphorothioates and haloacyl groups. Methods in which the probe has a number of identical nucleotide sequences for hybridizing with secondary probes can often lead to increased calibration curve sensitivity. The probes required for this, however, are 1) difficult to manufacture, and 2) the labelled probes do not stoichiometrically saturate the nucleic acid sequences on the probes. The test sensitivity achieved is therefore much less than that of the PCR method (AIDS 7/suppl., 11-14 (1993); J. Med. Virol. 43, 262-268 (1994); J. Infect. Dis. 170, 1172-1179 (1994); AIDS Res. & Human Retrovir. 11/3, 353-361 (1995))., 110219=A concentration range of 0-1000 pmol/l was measured for 20 nt-HBV-oligo-5\u2032-biotin under the test conditions described. The DNP-labelled probes were used in a concentration of 10 nmol/l, and the <DNP>aequorin conjugate was used in a concentration of approx. 1\ufffd106 RLU/test. The results are shown in Table 1., 78980=The two activated components are then brought into reaction in a coupling ratio of aequorin-SH: Fab-MH=2.5:1 in 25 mM HEPES, 3 mM EDTA, pH 7.5. The concentration of aequorin-SH is approximately 1 mg/ml. Allow the reaction to take place for 60 minutes at 25\ufffd C. while stirring. Add cysteine or dithiothreitol (final concentration of 2 mM or 5 mM, respectively) to stop the reaction., 102882=The following standard phosphoramidites are used as nucleotide components: 5\u2032-dimethyoxytrityl-N-benzoyl-2\u2032-deoxy adenosine, 3\u2032-[(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl)]-phosphoramidite, 5\u2032-dimethoxytrityl-N-benzoyl-2\u2032-desoxy cytidine, 3\u2032-{(cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl)]-phosphoramidite, 5\u2032-dimethoxytrityl-N-isobutyryl-2\u2032-desoxy guanosine, 3\u2032-[(2-cyanoethyl)]-(N,N-diisopropyl)]-phosphoramidite, and 5\u2032-dimethoxytrityl-2\u2032-desoxy thymidine, [(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl)]-phosphoramidite (from ABI). The following is used in the X position for branching: 3-[N-(9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)-6-amino capronic acid]-amino-1-(4,4\u2032-dimethoxytrityl)-1,2-propandiol-2-[(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diiso-propyl)]phosphoramidite. The following is used as the label in the Y position: DNP-TEG-phosphoramidite (FIG. 12, Glen Research 10-1985. Refer also to: Nucleic Acids Research 21, 1993, 1705-1712). The following is used in the Z position for linking: 5\u2032-thiol modifier C6 (Glen Research 10-1926). The quantity of oligonucleotide synthesized is 1.3 \u25a1mol on a 5\u2032-dimethoxytrityl-2\u2032-desoxy thymidine 3\u2032-succinoyl long chain alkyl amino-controlled pore glass carrier. After 5 hours at 55\ufffd C. in a 32% ammonia solution, the oligonucleotides are separated from the carrier and, simultaneously, the \u03b2-cyanoethyl groups and base-labile amino protective groups are separated. The raw products are purified using HPLC (Lichrosorb RP 18, 8\ufffd250 mm, from CS\u2014Chromatography Service) using a 0.1 M triethylammonium acetate/acetonitrile gradient, then desalted using dialysis. The thiol group protection of the oligonucleotide 2 is removed per the Glen Research User Guide, extracted 5 times with acetic acid, and then lyophilized in a Speedvac., 57972=Larger pieces of oligonucleotides can be manufactured by performing corresponding functionalization steps on the 3\u2032and 5\u2032-ends of numerous oligonucleotides and performing the steps described above. These oligonucleotide pieces have many functionalized beta-bromoacetamido groups, which represent potential branching points. Activatable amino groups can also be inserted directly into the oligonucleotide strand using amino alkyl phosphite derivatives during phosphoramidite synthesis. The advantage of this method is that the primary sequence with potential branching points can be thoroughly synthesized on a CPG carrier. In a subsequent step, a third oligonucleotide\u2014which was manufactured by inserting nucleotides that were functionalized using a label-attracting group\u2014is converted to thiophosphate ester on the 5\u2032-end. Branched multimers can now be made directly (without templates) by reacting this oligonucleotide with the inserted beta-bromoacetamido functions. These branched multimers represent the basis for the desired signal amplification based on the number of branching points and detectable labels per branching. Unlike the method described in WO 95/01365, relatively short third oligonucleotides can be inserted in the method according to this invention. As described above, they are preferably already labelled with a label-attracting group when attached to the branching points, e.g., when they are synthesized by means of the phosphoramidite method (e.g., per EP-A-0 399 330)., 63071=Of all members of this family of Ca2+-activatable photoproteins, aequorin has been used most frequently in recent years with receptor-ligand binding assays. Preferred proteins include, e.g., obelin, halistaurin (=mitrocomin), phiallidin (=clytin) or aequorin. These proteins all emit a light signal when they are activated, which makes it possible to determine their quantity or presence by measuring the light intensity. The use of such photoproteins in traditional tests, and the mechanism by which it leads to signal formation, is described, for instance, in Cornier, M. L. et al., Photochem. & Photobiol. 49/4, 509-512 (1989) or Smith, D. F. et al. in \u201cBioluminescence and Chemiluminescence: Current Status (P. Stanley & L. Krick, eds.), John Wiley and Sons, Chichester, U.K. 1991, 529-532. The advantages of these signal-producing components are a shorter measuring time, increased quantum yield compared with other luminescence labelling systems, and a reduced reagent-induced background, i.e., the technical detection range of the luminometer that can fully exploited, and a broader dynamic range of measurement. The relatively small spatial requirement of the calcium-activatable photoproteins and their cofactors greatly reduces the size of the probe complex created after the conjugate binds. In addition, these calcium-activatable photoproteins do not interact with DNA structures, as is the case with acridinium salts or various chromophores, for instance., 108079=Immobilization: by means of 20 nt-oligo-5\u2032-biotin (FIG. 7) in a concentration range of 0.1-10,000 pmol/l, which also functions as the substance to be detected., 51673=According to one embodiment, nucleic acids that are made by inserting N4-(N-(6-trifluoroacetyl-amidocaproyl)-2-aminoethyl)-2\u2032-deoxycytidine during phosphoramidite synthesis are cross-linked using p-phenylene diisothyocyanate (DITC) as a homo-bifunctional linker, and a suitable, double-stranded fraction is isolated from the product mixture, e.g., star-structured multimers. The manufacture of these multimers is described in \u201cLuminescence Immunoassay and Molecular Applications\u201d (1990, Editor: Knox Van Dyke, CRC Press, Boca Raton, USA). Another possibility for branching is provided by branching monomers that have a total of three hydroxyl groups per nucleotide. The additional hydroxyl group that is orthogonal to the 5\u2032, 3\u2032-axis can be bound with cytidine in position N4 by means of a hexamethylene group, for instance. Both the 5\u2032-hydroxyl group and the hydroxyl group located on the base (which formerly had the same protective group) react with a nucleoside phosphoramidite during oligonucleotide synthesis according to phosphoramidite procedure. As a result, the oligonucleotide chain being constructed branches every time a branching monomer is used. By varying the protective groups, a linear DNA strand can be synthesized that has branching points everywhere that these branching monomers were incorporated. Subsequent selective cleavage of the protective group of the second hydroxyl group enables the lateral strands to be synthesized separately. These secondary sequences project from the primary sequence like teeth in a comb (comb structures). These methods are described, for instance, in Nucleic Acids Research 17/17, 6959-6967 (1989) and Nucleic Acids Research Symposium 24, 197-200 (1991)., 62347=high concordance between nucleobases and amino acide sequences (>60% homology) of the individual representatives from the family of Ca2+-activatable photoproteins, as illustrated clearly by the cloning of aequorin (Prasher D., et al., Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 126/3, 1259-1268, 1985; Prasher, D., et al., Methods in Enzymology 133, 288-299, 1986; Prasher D., et al., Biochemistry 26, 1326-1332, 1987; Cornier M., et al., Photochemistry and Photobiology 49/4, 509-512, 1989), Obelin (Illarionov Boris A., et al., Gene 153, 273-274, 1995), Clytin (Inouye S. & Tsuji F., FEBS 315/3, 343-346, 1993) and Mitrocomin (Fagan T. F., et al., FEBS, 333/3 301-305, 1993)., 150402=The measuring range in this case was 0-1000 pmol/l. To reduce the amount of non-specific binding, 200 mM Na2 tartrate\ufffd2H2O was added to the test buffer (\u2192salt-rich buffer environment) and the DNP probe concentration was reduced to 5 nmol/l. In fact, the non-specific binding was more than halved. Compared with specific binding, the results described earlier and, therefore, the concept according to the invention, were confirmed once more. Reference is made to Table 3., 56806=Another possible method of manufacturing is based on the synthesis method described in WO 95/01365. It is based on the very efficient coupling of thiophosphate or dithiophosphate groups and haloacyl or haloalkyl groups. Thiophosphate and betabromoacetamide functions that couple and form thiophosphorylacetamide bridges are preferably used. Branched multimers that can be used as the nucleic acid-type portion can be made as follows. In the first step, an initial oligonucleotide that is amino or aminoalkyl-derivatized on the 5\u2032-end is reacted with N-hydroxysuccinimedyl-beta-bromo-acetate, forming a terminal beta-bromoacetamido function. In the second step, a second oligonucleotide is functionalized as 3\u2032-O-phosphoryl-(2-aminomethyl-) ethyl-thiophosphate ester on the 3\u2032end. The terminal thiophosphate group of the second oligonucleotide then reacts, with a nucleophilic attack on the bromo-substituted beta-C atom on the 5\u2032-end of the first oligonucleotide, and both oligonucleotides are ligated. The aminomethyl function is then activated into a beta-bromoacetamido function via condensation with N-hydroxy succinimidyl-beta-bromoacet ate.}",
