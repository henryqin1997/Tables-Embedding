    "textBeforeTable": "Advanced Catching Metrics No BP Roundtables have mentioned this guy. BP Roundtables Brantly is an average defensive catcher with above-average plate skills and an advanced approach. He had that in college and has cleaned up some of the defensive weaknesses to get where he is in Miami. He's capable of starting 110-120 games a year and helping the Marlins immediately. For the record, I don't believe there are many catchers that should start more than 120 or so games behind the dish. Brantly's bat could warrant some time at DH in road interleague play. (Jason A. Churchill) Does Rob Brantly have both the bat and the necessary tools of ignorance to make it as an everyday major league catcher? (Paul from DC) 2012-11-20 13:00:00\u00a0(link to chat) It's hard to see a big leap in Jarrod Saltalamacchia's OBP given his incredibly high strikeout percentages. I'd still take Salty over Rob Brantly. We know what we'll get with Salty. Brantly - who I do like long-term - seems like a complete unknown. (Mike Gianella) Can Saltalamacchia raise his OBP this",
