Tips for prospective students Go on campus and take a tour or even spend the night with a current Simmons student to get the feel of the school. Am enjoying being here Simmons College is in the perfect location because it is in a city without feeling as though it is in a city. There are tons of opportunities to expand oneself at Simmons. Am learning a lot All of my classes have been instructed by extremely knowledgeable professors and they are always available for outside questions.",
