            "Check out the campus and surrounding area. Definitely sit in on classes that interest you, and most importantly: try to talk to current students to get a feel for the campus atmosphere. The people in admissions and financial aid offices were really rude to me when I was applying. I actually decided not to go to Xavier for many reasons, but also because I could not believe how I was being treated by the staff just for simply asking if my file was complete for application ad if they'd received all my test scores, etc. I didn't want to deal with this for the next four years. I go to Loyola University New Orleans now and love it.",
            "Xavier is relatively cheap for what it offers, but since it is not extremely well known it does not get as much private endowment to use towards financial aid.",
            "I think that Xavier is really not in the best part of New Orleans, and I wouldn't like living there. There is a big commuter population at Xavier and the ages of incoming students ranges greatly. All told it is not for me because these factors make the school less of a community.",
            "The professors at Xavier seemed very good. They were interested in helping students learn, and there seemed to be a good student-faculty relationship."

There is a curfew (12:00 Sunday-Thursday and 2:00 Friday & Saturday) and the bathrooms are hall bathrooms. On the upside, the RA's schedule cute get togethers for the floors to mingle., 326909=Considering I was on a scholarship, I thought that the quality of education and resources offered was fair. This is a private institution, so it's pretty expensive: tuition is around $18000 a year + $4000-$5000 room & board + $2000-$3000 fees + around $200-$300 for books. There are also other random things you have to pay for when attending. I'm a chemistry major and was recommended/required to buy a $2 laminated periodic table that could be used on tests, a $35 lab coat, and $5 lab goggles., 114311=When you walk into the communal bathroom and dookie is smeared all over the floor, it really puts into perspective where you are and with whom you live. Freshman dorms especially are horrible. They are separated by gender, come with a very strict 12:30 AM curfew on weekdays and 2:00 AM curfew on weekends, and are just old. The air condition unit in my room would leak, and it wasn't until I and my roommate decided not to clean the water up and let it leak into the hallway, that it was fixed. (They probably didn't want that lawsuit for a slip and fall). I heard of multiple room units that didn't work, which is even more of a problem when you're in a place where temperatures reach 90+ degrees with 100% humidity. There is a janitorial service that cleans the restrooms once a day everyday and they do a decent job, but when you're in a place with a bunch of dudes that still have a high-school mentality, it kinda doesn't look like it was cleaned at all., 141322=The school has a very unique menu when compared to out-of-state schools. There are many cajun dishes that they love to serve, like red-beans and rice, gumbo, dirty rice, and others. Even if you're not from Louisiana, you'll easily get accustomed to the food here. I will write this though: have emergency food items in your dorm!! The cafeteria workers are human, and sometimes the food that they serve isn't as great as what you're used to at home. If you do find that the cafeteria food is bad on a certain day, there are many restaurants close to the campus. Specific ones include McDonalds, KFC, a lot of Chinese restaurants, Popeye's, and other small restaurants. WARNING!!!: the Freshman 15 does exist on this campus!!! Make sure that you have frequent workout regimens, and think smart about what you eat., 384281=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 380982=Other than that, I love the Chemistry courses the most. Xavier makes Chemistry fun and interesting. Warning: Biology not so much. I think they were weeding the CHEM PrePharmacy students in the spring semester in 2015. The first test in biology was an average that is on a very low 60% range. I was one of the lucky few who made a B on their first test., 250060=Xavier is located 10 mins from the world famous Bourbon Street if you ever need a get away from the study life. If the night life isn't your scene there are tons of restaurants to go get lost in the local cajun cuisine. Being one of the first major ports in the New World, New Orleans is rich with French flavor as well as many interesting historic sites.}",

Students who enjoy a more personal relationship with a professors Tips for prospective students Always be ready to work when you come to class Always use planner Utilize the fact the professors are constantly there to help to you Organization is the key to a smooth college life and transition Bang for the buck Xavier is definitely worth the money because you can go to no other school and receive a better education. This is true because you are given the chance to succeed. The school works with you no matter any issue you may.
