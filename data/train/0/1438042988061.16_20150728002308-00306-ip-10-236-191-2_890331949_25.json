            "Curfews, required dorm living, and worship requirements can be really annoying but the deans are always there to listen.",
            "It's not the most difficult college you could go to, but the professors do expect you to think, something many high school teachers don't really want.",
            "I went to a high school that was focused on preparing you for college. I did very well on my ACT/SAT and transitioning to Andrews wasn't very difficult, but it is a transition. Be flexible when you first get here. I spent my entire freshman year working and studying, so I didn't have many friends. Don't do that! Don't worry so much that you miss out on the relationships. They matter too.",
            "Andrews has been great for me academically. It is the only Adventist university in the top 200 and it was also given a most underrated college award. It's a good school and the faculty is always willing to help you understand a subject better."

It is a good school for those who have a major within communication. And it is also a good school for those that want to strengthen their relationship with God. Tips for prospective students It is a good idea to get involved in something on campus; it can be a club, sports team, or an outreach ministry. It is good to get involved because it gives you something constructive to do when you're not studying, and it is a good way to make friends. I also recommend that new students apply for jobs on campus, especially jobs within their major. That way they are gaining some experience and networking at the same time. If you are shy, really push yourself to branch out and meet new people. If you are a really dedicated student, that's great, but make sure that you make some time",
