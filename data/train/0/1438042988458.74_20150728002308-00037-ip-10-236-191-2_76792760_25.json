To plan an IPv6 implementation, refer to Chapter\u00a04, Planning an IPv6 Network (Tasks). The tasks assume that you have an operational TCP/IP network at your site, either IPv4-only or dual-stack IPv4/IPv6. If you want to implement IPv6 at your site but have not done so, refer to following chapters for more information: Administering Default Address Selection Monitoring Packet Transfers With the snoop Command Displaying Routing Information With the traceroute Command Administering and Logging Network Status Displays Probing Remote Hosts With the ping Command Monitoring Network Status With the netstat Command Monitoring the Interface Configuration With the ifconfig Command Major TCP/IP Administrative Tasks (Task Map) This chapter contains tasks for administering a TCP/IP network.
