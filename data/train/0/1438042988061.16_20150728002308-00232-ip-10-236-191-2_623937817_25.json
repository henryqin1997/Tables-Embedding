            "Description",
            "Data Collection: Using a Leica Systems ALS50 Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) system, flight lines of standard density ground spacing of 1.4 meter and 1.0 meter (within the Wilmington Urban Area) data were collected over areas in Kent County, DE (approximately 800 square miles) and New Castle County, DE. Multiple returns were recorded for each laser pulse along with an intensity value for each return. The data acquisition occurred in 7 missions between March 31, 2007 and April 5, 2007. During the LIDAR campaign, the Sanborn field crew conducted a GPS field survey to establish final coordinates of the ground base stations for final processing of the base-remote GPS solutions.",
            "Airborne GPS Processing: Airborne GPS data were differentially processed and integrated with the post processed IMU data to derive a smoothed best estimate of trajectory (SBET). The SBET was used to reduce the LiDAR slant range measurements to a raw reflective surface for each flight line. The overlap between flight lines was removed to provide a homogeneous coverage, and the coverage was classified to extract a bare earth digital elevation model (DEM). Airborne GPS is differentially processed using the GrafNAV V7.50 software by Waypoint Consulting of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The PDOP and distance separation are as follows: IMU data is processed using the PosPac V4.2 software by Applanix Corporation of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada. The reflective surface is derived using the ALS Post Processor software by Leica Geosystems GIS & Mapping Division of Atlanta, Georgia. The classification and quality control (QC) of LiDAR data is carried out using TerraScan software by Terrasolid Limited of Helsinki, Finland.",
            "IMU data Processing: IMU data provides information concerning roll, pitch and yaw of collection platform during collection event. IMU information allows the pulse vector to be properly placed in 3D space allowing the distance from the aircraft reference point to be properly positioned on the elevation model surface. IMU data is processed using the PosPac V4.2 software by Applanix Corporation of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada.",

            "LIDAR Point Classification The classification and quality control (QC) of LiDAR data is carried out using TerraScan software by Terrasolid Limited of Helsinki, Finland.",
            "Output LAS Files The product output of LiDAR data is carried out using TerraScan software by Terrasolid Limited of Helsinki, Finland. LAS Binary and ArcGIS shapefiles were created. The shapefiles represented the bare earth product. All data were tiles to be consistent with the statewide orthoimagery tile layout. Two sets of data were provided -- one in ft (vertical) and the other in meters (vertical). Both had meters horizontal units.",
            "The NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) received files in LAS format. The files contained LiDAR intensity and elevation measurements. CSC performed the following processing on the data to make it available within the Digital Coast: 1. The data were converted from State Plane coordinates to geographic coordinates. 2. The data were converted from orthometric to ellipsoid heights using Geoid03. 3. The LAS header fields were sorted by latitude and updated. 4. The data were filtered to eliminate outliers.",
            "The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) received lidar data files via ftp transfer from the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The data are currently being served via NOAA CSC Digital Coast at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. The data can be used to re-populate the system. The data are archived in LAS or LAZ format. The LAS format is an industry standard for LiDAR data developed by the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS); LAZ is a loseless compressed version of LAS developed by Martin Isenburg (http://www.laszip.org/). The data are exclusively in geographic coordinates (either NAD83 or ITRF94). The data are referenced vertically to the ellipsoid (either GRS80 or ITRF94), allowing for the ability to apply the most up to date geoid model when transforming to orthometric heights."
