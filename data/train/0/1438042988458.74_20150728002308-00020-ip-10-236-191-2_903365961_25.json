Events on campus that I enjoyed include open-mic nights, talent shows, musicians, and comedians. Free health and wellness classes such as karate and yoga are offered in the evenings and the Rec Center is available until 11:00 pm. Other than that, I enjoy being able to walk down the hall or over to the next building and hang out with friends from school., 99246=College is challenging but what makes Saint Martin's University distinct is that it has a student to faculty ratio of 12:1, helping students better attain a better education. The largest lecture hall seats 45 students and that alone displays the universities commitment to having faculty easily establish inter-personal relationships with their students. Professors will go out of their way to make more time for their students outside of office hours to ensure academic success., 167413=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck St. Martin's being a private university is expensive though some say less expensive then other private universities. However they do try to help you a lot with the FAFSA and other scholarships. The school itself offers about 100 different types of scholarships that one can apply for or look for other sources for example loans. Not to mention their tuition management systems is helpful because you can pay the money for school monthly and not all at once. In addition the university offers a lot of jobs since 7 out of 10 students at their university has a job with the university. Overall the basic idea is that if one truly tries they can find different sources of income for their tuition while at the same time receiving a private education. Am enjoying being here While visiting several schools in Washington, what made Saint Martin's University stand out is it's peaceful atmosphere. The place is intimate, quiet and surrounded by 380 acres of green. One can get a blanket sit on the grass and have a picnic, study or even read a book. The church that is also on campus with the university adds even more serenity to the place because sometimes one can hear the bell, which sounds like a soundtrack added to a play to make it stand",
