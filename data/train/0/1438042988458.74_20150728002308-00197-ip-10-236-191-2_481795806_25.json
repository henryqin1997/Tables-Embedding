An overall system overview diagram is shown in FIG. 10. This Figure combines the overview FIGS. 3, 5, 7 and 9 as well as FIG. 2. The numerals used in this Figure have been previously identified and described. Therefore, a detailed discussion of this Figure is omitted. Overall System Overview Alternatively, the exposure billing routines provide an ad hoc query mechanism that will allow marketing analysts to further explore the demographics of the exposures achieved during a campaign. The query tools will access the exposure accounting data base for information about exposures, and the targeting data base for demographic information about subscribers who have been exposed to content segments by the invention. The exposure billing module 300 also provides standard exposure reporting and data export facilities to support billing and invoicing for exposures delivered by the on-line queue manager 20. The exposure accounting report, created by the exposure billing routines, presents the aggregate number of exposures for each customer and the total price for these exposures. The exposure prices are computed using the pricing tables associated with each campaign.",
