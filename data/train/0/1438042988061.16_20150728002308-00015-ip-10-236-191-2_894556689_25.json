    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Personally, I recommend getting all your core classes done at a community college or a smaller school, and using the money you saved to finish your degree at a really great school. Be watchful and make sure the classes you are taking will transfer to wherever you want to go, but that information is easily found on the transfer equivalency section of the college website. Chattahoochee Tech is a great place to get your core classes done. Most of them transfer, the teachers are nice and understanding, and most of them are rated pretty highly on ratemyprofessor.com Bang for the buck I don't think I could have found a better deal for my money. Classes are under a hundred bucks a credit, books aren't expensive, there are hardly any extra fees... the application is only $15 bucks! The money I have saved here getting my core classes done has been amazing. The financial aid office has been tremendous. I had already applied for the Hope Scholarship, but the people there helped me find and receive the Pell Grant and the Hope Grant, so I go to school completely free. The people at the office are incredibly helpful and have done so much for me. Am enjoying being here There are plenty of extracurricular",
