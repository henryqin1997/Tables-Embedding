Something similar to the one in [[1017] won't work, because we don't know when (if ever) the Time will end. I was thinking about T = c + n * (1 hour), where n is current frame and c is a couple of days before the beginning of Time, but it seems too boring. --DiEvAl (talk) 14:57, 11 June 2013 (UTC)}",

We can see some chicks at the end of his walk at images 1374-1376 [11]. It just took me a while to figure out what it was.Galois (talk) 20:35, 4 June 2013 (UTC), 495518=I found a way to updates the pictures, it's just a little bit tricky... --Dgbrt (talk) 19:25, 6 May 2013 (UTC), 417028=In the frame-by-frame breakdown, the \"Image\" field simply gives the time in hours, while the \"Time\" field gives the time in days+hours. It would be helpful if the \"Image\" field instead gave an ordinal number indicating the number of frames (e.g., this would help to correlate the Transcript on this page with the frame numbers here. The current \"Image\" field need not be deleted (I personally prefer time in hours to time in days+hours), but it might be relabeled as \"Time in Hours\". Implementing this would require some use of scripts, and would be best if adopted by the person updating the frame-by-frame breakdown in the first place. 132.236.6.90 16:42, 19 April 2013 (UTC), 512767=What do you think? --Dgbrt (talk) 20:46, 10 May 2013 (UTC), 695376=Man that is an atrocious accent. 216.239.45.91 13:37, 17 July 2013 (UTC), 364456=I'm seeing some strange stuff now. I have a script that uses wget of time.png to get the redirected hash png like Lockyy is doing. And I can verify that when you go to the 1190 page in the browser you get a different hash. But the previous hour and this hour, unlike the ones before it, the two hash pngs are different. And when I refresh the screen in my browser at the 1190 page, first I see the image I get from time.png, then the image refreshes with the other one. I'm not sure what this means or what we are supposed to do with it. I added the time.png hashes to the table for the last two hours but we probably need a way of indicating the difference. -- Bugstomper (talk) 20:38, 30 March 2013 (UTC), 455351=The early 80s song Fade to Grey from the band Visage comes to my mind. Memories of what happened start to fade over time and get more and more pale. 213.23.38.20 (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~), 442853=The most recent event is Megan walking in, saying \"bye!\" in *lower case*, and leaving. From the lower case, which is different from the rest of the comic, I infer that she was talking to *us*, not (eg) herself or the sandcastle! I reckon it's just going to fill up with water until the page is a static black rectangle. Especially since she and Cueball just talked about going off and exploring, grabbed their bags, and left. -cosmogoblin 94.197.127.235 13:57, 26 April 2013 (UTC), 432320=The cancer metaphors are quite intriguing, but my take is environmental, possibly pollution and global warming. The French girl (beret) could be a nod to the Disneyland Paris castle. If so it\u2019s our first interactive feedback with Randall on the 1190 strip.Galois (talk) 22:42, 24 April 2013 (UTC), 628418=Is someone already stitching together a map of the stars as they move through the frames? I could do it, but I'm too lazy *g*. And if we have that, the relative position of the sun to the stars should be sufficient to determine the day of the year (depending on the accuracy of the drawings) and probably, assuming the first bright dot was indeed Venus, we might even be able to determine if the story takes/took place this year. Maybe other astronomical objects show (or don't show) and help to further narrow down the time. --92.76.250.121 00:18, 28 June 2013 (UTC), 310986=It's entirely possible that the \"hash\" is actually randomly generated. Just a thought. 129.21.119.153 07:03, 25 March 2013 (UTC), 635115=So if it's Earth, where could they be? There's not a lot of south-facing coasts around 30N. The only large one is the Gulf Coast of the US, but there's not much in the way of hills much less anything you could call a mountain close to the shore. The only exception I can really see is maybe around Mobile, which at last has some hills. There's the north end of the Persian Gulf and of the Gulf of California, but for both of those the hills are east of of the most obvious large river. Though the Gulf of California would make sense in other ways -- rivers that only run to the sea in the wet season, for example. There's South Korea, but the southern coast of that is broken up into a fringe of islands and peninsula, there's not really a solid stretch of coast to walk east along. Tavella (talk) 00:14, 28 June 2013 (UTC), 328302=wanted to add an image to the list above, but didn't know at what timestamp to add it, got 69085b480cb82911b19fe8f114909756989eed89b0d227db0f59c1843de7ba24.png at 2013-03-26 09:47 CET (UTC+0100) /Puggan, 763325=Frame 3072 - Title text has once again changed to \"....\" Uglystick (talk) 22:12, 25 July 2013 (UTC), 429488=For me, this is clearly about cancer and the impacts it has on a relationship over time. Randall's now wife was diagnosed and treated for cancer recently and through this comic, he's trying to portray the anxious wait they faced through treatment and remission. He has put us into his shoes by keeping us waiting in suspense to see how things end up. The passing of time represents their life together. At first it's just them relaxing together, probably the dating phase. Soon they start building a life together, represented by the sand castle. The castle evolves over time, much like their life has. Difficulties and gaffes in their relationship are depicted, for example when cueball trips and breaks down part of the wall. Eventually all efforts are diverted and put into defending against the approaching sea, which represents the cancer. The wall, the platform, all represent the steps taken to prevent and/or prepare for it's impending progress. The river represents the cure for cancer, which is still pretty far out, as cueball mentioned. There are many many more clues I see and explanations I can give to support this idea (castle in the sky, the rain, progress with research, etc.), but this is just starting point. I'm excited to see where the comic will end up, but I guess we just need to \"wait for it\". --Nick (talk) 21:25, 24 April 2013 (UTC), 786654=The second night is darker on geekwagon than on mscha and aubronwood, which both use this image from xkcd.com. Did we miss a rapid animation? Jahvascriptmaniac (talk) 14:31, 27 July 2013 (UTC), 708092=Probably the \"strangers\" ought to be called the \"castle people\" since that is how Megan and Cueball seem to think of them. Taibhse (talk) 09:35, 17 July 2013 (UTC), 534154=Regarding the accuracy, I imagine Randall may have used a data model of countoured landscape (1D or 2D, plus height) to auto-generate the scrolling/panning/rotating scenery base prior to decorating with figures/etc, but whether there's enough information to fully back-derive such a map from the ever-changing landscape I couldn't say. I assume assumptions, at the very least, and maybe some inventiveness on the part of any given interpreter. 178.98.124.195 19:42, 8 June 2013 (UTC), 388476=I think by tasting the water Cueball was preparing himself for the inevitable - the water is going to continue to rise and nothing they can do will stop it: they are going to drown. This strip is about the slow, inextirpable, approach of Death - and this isn't the Death from a Terry Pratchett novel. Joncaves (talk) 20:29, 9 April 2013 (UTC), 548288=I agree that these orientations are plausible from the dialog in the strip, but remember, we're already pretty certain that they're not in the same universe as us, so we may not be able to assume that the sun rises in the east. There's no evidence to demonstrate that their world rotates west-to-east like ours does, but there's no evidence that it doesn't, either. Let's at least remember the possibility that all of these directions are reversed from what our current theory states. 71.201.53.130 18:24, 30 May 2013 (UTC), 460328=OK, *now* it's completely white (as of day 36 10:00) Larry (talk) 14:08, 29 April 2013 (UTC), 488945=I still could get the correct update, but I have to check all downloads so far.--Dgbrt (talk) 18:41, 4 May 2013 (UTC), 697325=I suppose it is safe to assume that the black frame (Frame 2698) represents some indeterminate passage of time, since we do see Cueball now speaking the language of the Beanie-Wearers. What is strange, and perhaps it is just Randall being lazy, is that if you compare the frames before and after the black frame, there is absolutely no changes to vegetation, and very few changes to anything else. Vegetation would have been the biggest culprit to a lengthy time interval. (Again, assuming it took some non-trivial amount of time for Cueball to learn the new language.) --68.147.179.172 20:01, 10 July 2013 (UTC), 440966=Starting at frame 895 the black started fading to white, I think. 217.81.72.248 12:03, 26 April 2013 (UTC), 533208=Where did the map go? I'm getting \"...does not exist or cannot be displayed\" Does your page have an error? Or are you having hosting issues?--Gerry (talk) 01:36, 31 May 2013 (UTC), 336926=For those wondering about the Javascript behind this: I posted my analysis of the Javascript on the xkcd forums, and further de-obfuscated and annotated the code over on GitHub. Here's a quick summary though: it holds open a connection to xkcd's servers and listens for instructions and follows them. Those instructions are either \"load a new image\" or \"reload the page\". So, you don't have to mash F5, it will automatically update the image when they're available. We have no way to control how fast the images come or when they do, and it's quite possible for them to update forever. --Fiveofoh (talk) 06:41, 27 March 2013 (UTC), 349071=I think they're bulding a sand replica of King's Landing for the Game Of Thrones season 3 premiere 201.239.18.75 (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~), 473561=I added a section for normalized versions of the first 10 hours of day 36. If anyone wants me to add more, e.g. go back to where the fade started, I would. BTW, I used something like 'pngtopnm $i | pnmnorm | pnmtopng > $j' inside a loop. Those commands are from the NetPBM package. Larry (talk) 23:33, 30 April 2013 (UTC), 419456=I think it's now fixed. Patzer (talk) 03:59, 20 April 2013 (UTC), 375978=Could Cueball and Megan be building a European city, as it evolved, was damaged and remodelled where 1 day of strips is 100 years? Maybe Cueball is curretly remodelling Notre Dame de Paris or Westminster??? If so, it should get interesting around day 17 129.238.237.96 17:34, 4 April 2013 (UTC)rbnm, 345844=A controllable version of the same comic is available at http://xkcd.aubronwood.com/ - slow/fast movement, pause, control back and forth. It also has the image # on the top left. Auto updating. 59.182.173.88 20:56, 27 March 2013 (UTC), 454401=Just an afterthought, a meteor hit directly on the sand castle would let Randall go out in a blaze of glory. I hope beret girl is OK.Galois (talk) 23:27, 28 April 2013 (UTC), 691489=I just noticed that translator often puts a \u00b0 or \u00af above last letter in some sentences, just like in stranglish (did we come up with a better name for it yet?). I think this confirms that \u00b0 and \u00af is stranglish punctuation. Also since stranglish has punctuation, it can't be substitution cipher applied to lojban. --DiEvAl (talk) 21:55, 17 July 2013 (UTC), 488847=969:00 41/09:00 f8a6414c334a71481e16428691fe8465098b2bae956e44727d0482c7632a84ff.png, 567266=In the hut scene (June 20) there seems to be something large moving in the bushes next to the fence. There was also something something poking in on the left back by the cairn (a few frames back). 216.239.45.91 18:18, 20 June 2013 (UTC), 522330=You realize that what we've seen so far is what the beginning of a comic that goes on forever looks like\u00a0:-) Tom A. (\"I don't want to be immortal through my art! I want to be immortal by not dying.\" - Woody Allen.) Meteoricshipyards (talk) 14:20, 13 May 2013 (UTC), 528854=The latest frame (1506) has two trees. They are almost certainly baobab trees. There are 8 species of baobab tree, but of those 8, 6 are endemic to the island of Madagascar, including the species which the trees in the comic most resemble, the Grandidier baobab. Even if they are not one of the six species endemic to Madagascar, the fact that they are baobabs still limits them to the continent of Africa, the countries of Oman and Yemen, and northwestern Australia. This means that the big sea, if it is an ocean, is most likely the Indian Ocean. 76.92.118.150 18:30, 21 May 2013 (UTC), 678368=It's the wrong end of the river for them to be building a dam, but I'm wondering, with all the surveying equipment, if they are diverting more water into the basin that Cueball and Megan live in. But they seem like pleasant enough people, quick to help Megan. It's hard to be believe they would drown the area without checking to see if, y'know, people live there. Tavella (talk) 23:02, 9 July 2013 (UTC), 462560=I don't see this as a comic in a comic -- I see it more as act 2 (after the fadeout of act 1, with the stage crew jumping the gun and being caught on camera heading on stage to change the set). Theoretically, this second act can be as long as the first one -- The Quest for the Source of the River/Sea. (Hmmm, that reminds me of the song \"River in the Sea\" from the musical Ten November, a 2 minute sample available at http://www.prudencejohnson.com/sounds/gales/River_in_the_Sea.mp3). Meteoricshipyards (talk) 18:18, 29 April 2013 (UTC) Tom A., 579806=I opened a new page for the pictures: 1190: Time: Pictures. It's experimental and subject to (wiki-style collaborative) change. Galois (talk) 15:40, 16 June 2013 (UTC), 758482=That might be the tribes own camp. They may have moved the camp up into the hills to pick up the stuff that was left behind.

It looks like a (fictional) Semitic language, in which case individual characters could indicate syllables rather than letters, but I doubt that it is a simple cipher for English at the syllable level either. At this stage it is impossible to say how far he has gone in creating an original syntax, but I would note that we have seen the word that means \"water\" (or \"drink\") in at least two forms (a simple form used by Cueball, and a form with a kind of 3 at the beginning used as the last word of the Beanie's response to Cueball's picture). I'm confident the \u00af is simply a period, \u00b0 a question mark, and the double \u00af is an exclamation mark. The other stray marks could be other punctuation marks as well.

What impresses me is the level of ignorance this pair exhibits, compared to the couple we've come to know. This pair do not seem to understand oxygen starvation at higher altitudes, how tides work, etc. This almost flies in contradiction to the fact that, in the beginning, they were building sand castles. This presumes castles existed at some point in their own history if not currently. Castles indicate a certain level of knowledge and technology, which this current couple seem to lack knowledge of, to some large degree at least. If this strip 'ends' at the level of technology we've seen thus far and hinted at by this new tribe of people, I would suggest this indicates a world wide (or at least very large area) collapse of a prior civilization.

But they haven't been gone for a long time, because we've seen a staked sapling that is likely only a year or two old. They have vineyards and what look to be orchards. They appear to use tents, at least the frame we saw looked to be tied together at the top to form a teepee frame.

Up until now I had assumed that the previous regions had vegetation as well but Randall just hadn't bothered drawing it (such detail is rare in XKCD). So what does presence of vegetation mean? More rainfall? Higher elevation? Also how far have Cueball and Megan travelled? I don't think the frames are necessarily contiguous - if this was a movie we'd have background music to go with the images.

It should be the brightest thing in this view apart from Venus, and you can see the two stars that should flank it appear at Frame 2392, between Cueball's head and the tree, but no Antares. Which suggests that this is set sufficiently far in the future that Antares has gone supernova (which it is due to do.)

That said, the title text was \"wait for it\". This could be a euphamism suggesting \"keep waiting, this comic changes\", but it does have an implication that there is a \"finale\" to the comic that you should wait for.

(If the camera had maintained the original position, the characters would have simply gotten smaller as the walked away, but instead we got to see the walk across the frame while presumably following the shore.) In 997, the camera perspective just comes back around to be a profile shot again, looking down the shoreline, water once again on the right. -- 65.183.156.9 19:40, 30 April 2013 (UTC), 466641=Odd, it looks like +861, +862, and +863 are out of order, judging by the ground not changing at all and the characters not walking continuously.

The story (quest?) reads more like a series of isolated vignettes, but with a few themes being carried forward, such as the quest for the source of the rising sea. I'm here in homage to Randall's unique wit and humor, and having fun trying to second guess what he'll do next. I don't believe the setting is an actual place, but we have several clues that limit its location. I see this as a collection of disparate objects and events; some go together, some not, but with some running themes. Randall may be making some points (such as conservation, ecology, and not eating squirrels); although, I would have never filled a canteen from the small river without first boiling or purifying the water.

Looking at http://xkcd.aubronwood.com/# you can then see that 1111 and 1113 are also the same. The rapid perspective change makes the animation appear to strobe.

At this point we're not even clear how Randall is writing these comics: he may have designed them all from the start, or he may be writing 24 a day, going along with it, according to the natural progression of events and what has led up to now. It has interesting parallels with the design argument. It also makes you wonder about how it's all going to end. There are so many ongoing discussions - and have been from the start - about how the comic is going to conclude. Just as in real life we take so many different roads and never really know where we're going to end up. If we're continuing with the religious theme we could extend the metaphor even further, about what happens after we die. We don't know if we're going to just stop existing or if we're going to end up in some elaborate afterlife. We don't know what Randall's going to do - how long will the comic go on?

As usually happens with XKCD, it spawned some wonderful discussions, speculations and scientific explorations.

Although this may seem to disprove the theory that the Atlantic is flooding into the Mediterranean, it actually doesn't. Notice that Cueball \"felt\" that something was strange. What was strange was that they were accustomed to an extremely salty sea. Can you imagine filling up the Mediterranean Sea with ocean water then cutting it off from the Atlantic and allowing it to evaporate down to the size of C&M's sea? It would be extremely salty and you could float easily in it. The water from the Atlantic Ocean is nowhere near that salty so Cueball interprets it as fresh water. This will cause problems with the rescue because these people are not used to swimming in water that's not super salty. They can't float like they're used to and risk drowning. 198.103.184.76 16:32, 23 July 2013 (UTC)dbuck, 341713=---Thanks for the script!.
