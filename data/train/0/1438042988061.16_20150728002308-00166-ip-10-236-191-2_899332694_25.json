The college plans on changing this upcoming year., 128045=Each building is locked and can only be accessed by a student I.D. Underclassmen and students under the age of 21 have a 1:30 am curfew. We have security officers who do regular rounds around the campus, and an escort system that will drive students to places such as the light rail or anywhere within 2 blocks away from the school., 129394=There things to do for fun. North Central is located right next to a neighborhood park, there's a a skate park, a basket ball court, a small field and a playground. Therefore, one can go and hangout there on their leisure time in the Spring and early Fall. Also being right in downtown Minneapolis, we are also about two blocks away from the Metrodome stadium which now, in 2014, is being remodeled. When it is back up students can go catch a Vikings game. We are also about a mile away from Nicollet Mall, a bus ride away from Uptown, and lastly, the Mall of America is about a half and hour ride on the light rail (stop located right next to the Metrodome)., 149909=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Share any unusual traditions or locations on campus The whole campus is connected by skyways with the exception of two buildings. I had a semester where I never had a need to step outside, which was nice for the winter months. As far as traditions, there is The Week, which is basically one big carnival. There is also Battle of the Floors which is a competition where you put on one big drama skit with assigned themes. Be aware, however, that you are required to attend chapel everyday for an hour. Bang for the buck It is pricy, but as far a private schools go, it is actually cheap. A ton of scholarships are also up for grabs. What to do for fun On the bright side, you are living RIGHT in downtown Minneapolis (and it's completely safe, don't worry). You can walk to target, through the skyways, to the stonearch, and so much more. Restaurants are in abundance, and you have the whole cities at the disposal of your hand with the light rail half a mile away and the metro bus stops right outside the door. Food and Dining The cafeteria is a special place. I can bet that by your third year you will",
