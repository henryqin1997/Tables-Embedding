    "textAfterTable": "title GLAS/ICESat L2 Global Cloud Heights for Multi-layer Clouds (HDF5) comment The level 2 cloud layer height data with top and bottom heights, and ground heights are provided at a minimum of once per 4 seconds. Data granules will contain approximately 23 hours (14 orbits) of data. summary GLAH09 contains the cloud layer heights for researchers. Cloud layer height data consist of top and bottom heights for up to 10 layers below 20 km at 0.25 hz and 5 hz (40hz for below 4 km). Ground heights are provided at each resolution. Each GLAH09 file was created from an equivalent GLA09 binary file. The data used to create the GLAH09 values are contained in the equivalent GLAHxx files for the GLAxx files.
