I guess I expected a distribution along the lines of 65/35, similar to the playoff odds report. For sake of comparison I looked at the AL West where there's a comparable difference in win expectancy and sure enough the vote is 20:10. Thoughts?, 190689=Hmmmmm ... looks awfully similar to the 2010 final standings.

    "textBeforeTable": "AL East American League Standings One serious note before we get down to the fun, though. Kevin Goldstein and Jason Parks are still running their contest for the Up and In podcast. There are loads of awesome prizes, and it's for a good cause (Doctors Without Borders). Please consider entering and join in the fun!\u00a0 For the MVP voting, we've slightly amended the traditional points system in place that has\u00a0been used elsewhere, dropping fourth- and fifth-place votes to make it 10-7-5 for the MVP Award, and the regular 5-3-1 for the Cy Young and Rookie of the Year Awards (that's 5 points for a first-place vote, 3 points for a second-place vote, etc.). Next to each of these selections we've listed the total number of ballots, followed by the total number of points, and then the number of first-place votes in parentheses, if any were received. Today we reveal the Baseball Prospectus staff predictions for the division standings and the major player awards\u00a0 (MVP, Cy Young, and Rookie of the Year) in the American and National Leagues. Each staff member's division standings predictions may be found\u00a0later in the article. Here, we present a wisdom-of-the-crowds summary of the results. In each table you'll find the average rank of each team in their division with first-place votes in parentheses, plus the results of our pre-season MVP, Cy Young, and Rookie of the Year voting.\u00a0 by Baseball Prospectus",
