There is a nationally recognized meteorology program and in the fall of 2013 there will be a new state of the science complex for students to use., 246263=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 193070=There seems to be millions of activities for students to do for fun at SUNY Oswego. There's sports teams, clubs & organizations, Greek life, academic clubs and so much more. Throughout the year, Oswego has activities such as May Day. At May Day there's rides to go on, lots of free food and obstacle courses. This is just one of the many fairs/fun days that goes at at Oswego annually., 239256=For the types of students who always like to study in the library there's a 24 hour room where you can literally stay all night and study if you want. Also for anyone who is really into science, Shineman which is our science building is practically brand new it opened in Fall of 2013 and its absolutely gorgeous in there., 125404=Bridge Street Run- which is a day where all the students on campus wear a white t-shirt and get together and go to bridge street and sign each others t-shirts. May Day Weekend- A weekend in May, well usually the end of April where there are a bunch of parties and events right before finals week. Whiteout- The biggest hockey game of the year where the hockey team plays a hockey game and everyone wears white to encourage the team., 160390=In addition to regular dining hall hours, Oswego has late night offered which runs from 8:30 to 11 and you can get any kind of food. Most of the dining halls are normal buffets but Mackin is a unique dining hall where you can order up to 6.75$ in food and they will make it for you. It is used as a meal on your plan. You can also order food from local restaurants online using your flex money on your id and they will deliver right to the dorms. I would suggest the unlimited meal plan.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students International students have a ball here. The campus is so diverse, it can make any type of student feel comfortable. Tips for prospective students The school is very secluded so try to make friends quick. Pick you're dorms wisely. Pack very deep. Bring lots of food. Always have a debit card ready for quick withdrawals. Most importantly, do not be intimidated by anyone. Everyone won't like you but the ones that do, stick with them. oh yeah STUDY very very hard. Am enjoying being here I've made a lot of friends by joining clubs and attending various events. The more you put yourself out there, the more people you will meet. Am learning a lot There are a lot of classes offered at Oswego. I learned a lot about subjects that were not even in my major's curriculum.
