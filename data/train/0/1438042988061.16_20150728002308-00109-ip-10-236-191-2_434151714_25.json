            "WORKFLOW AUTOMATION & REQUEST PROCESSING - Methods and systems for transparently and seamlessly integrating various process and project management systems into a single system with a single point of entry for all users are disclosed. The system creates a web, tying together each of the independent systems to provide an intelligent, end-to-end workflow management system.",
            "International Cross Border Data Movement - In some embodiments, a data movement system comprises a rules repository configured to store rules associated with regulations of the first jurisdiction and the regulations of the second jurisdiction. A workflow manager is configured to determine jurisdictional complexity of the project as a function of the regulations of the first jurisdiction and the second jurisdiction. The workflow manager is configured to determine jurisdictional exposure of the project as a function of an organization's exposure to the first jurisdiction and the second jurisdiction. The workflow manager is configured to determine the risk of the project as a function of the jurisdictional complexity of the project and the jurisdictional exposure of the project.",
            "International Cross Border Data Movement - In some embodiments, a data movement system comprises a memory and a workflow manager. The memory is operable to store a request to move data from one or more jurisdictions, the request comprising (a) a data type, (b) a jurisdiction from which the data is to be moved, and (c) a purpose for moving the data. The workflow manager is configured to identify a set of data movement rules based at least in part upon the request. The set of data movement rules are associated with regulations of the jurisdiction identified in the request. The workflow manager is configured to apply at least one rule of the set of data movement rules to identify an action item to be completed in order to comply at least in part with the regulations.",

In one embodiment a bone conduction vibrator coupling member is provided with opposing surfaces configured to contact the housing of an earphone coupler about the opening of the housing and support the housing of a bone conduction vibrator above the opening of the earphone coupler housing. The coupling member has an inner wall defining an aperture extending through the coupling member that is configured to receive the vibrating member of the bone conduction vibrator and provide the vibrating member with access to the cavity of the earphone coupler. A calibration system includes a bone conduction vibrator coupling member positioned upon an earphone coupler. Methods for calibrating a bone conduction vibrator using such a calibration system are also provided.</td> <td>20130039520</td> <tr> </tr> <td>05-24-2012</td> <td><a href=\"/patents/app/20120130271\">Self-Administered Hearing Test Kits, Systems and Methods</a> - A kit for conducting a self-administered hearing test allows a test subject to generate calibrated pure tone stimuli during a hearing test without calibrating the testing system beforehand.

Margolis, Towson, MD US Patent application number Description Published 20130273076 METHOD FOR DETERMINING ACTIVATORS OF EXCITATORY SYNAPSE FORMATION - The invention provides methods of screening a compound that can increase spine/excitatory synapse formation and/or numbers. The compound is identified by contacting Ephexin5 with a test compound and selecting the compounds that inhibit Rho GEF activity of Ephexin5. Additionally, the invention also provides methods for increasing spine/excitatory synapse formation and/or numbers by contacting a neuron with an Ephexin5 inhibitor. 10-17-2013 Simeon R. Margolis, Lowell, MA US Patent application number Description Published 20090171973 USER-GENERATED MULTIMEDIA CONTENT FROM MOBILE AND NON-MOBILE DEVICES - A multimedia content system operates to manage mobile blogs created by users of communication devices. The mobile blogs may include content objects, which may be formed of audio components, text components, image, and/or video components. The various components may be formed from features of the communication devices. A user operating a mobile and/or non-mobile communication device may contact the system and provide one or more content objects for a mobile blog. The user may specify or create a community for accessing the mobile blog, and the multimedia content system publishes the blog for the community. Members of the community may view, edit, or augment the content objects of the mobile blog. Augmenting commands may be done through text messaging, email, or voice prompts.
