    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{136787=It was observed that 1 mL of AD 200 polymer mixed with 20 mL of mud and was able to form a solid/paste mixture. It was also observed that a 2:1 (AD 200 polymer:mud) mixing ratio, plus 20 mL of soda ash solution was used to form the solid/paste as shown in Table XII. When 2 mL of AD 200 polymer was mixed with 1 mL of mud, the concentration of AD 200 polymer changed from 50% to 33.33% (e.g., 33% active AD 200 polymer reacted with 20 mL of soda ash solution to form a solid). The amount of Na2CO3 used (0.1 g) was calculated based on the stoichiometric amount of Ca2+ in the solution. 1.0 g of Na2CO3 was used instead of 0.1 g to observe whether excess Na2CO3 affected the performance of AD 200 polymer. Excess Na2CO3 functioned as salt poisoning for AD 200 polymer, therefore the mixture had a harder time forming the solid., 81627=As can be seen from Tables III and IV, even with the dilution factor of 1:30 (AE 200 polymer:mud), the solid forms from the mixture of the two are still cement-like slurry paste. It can be further seen from such Tables that the dilution factor decreases to 10 instead of 20 when using the sea water version of the lignosulfonate mud. The cations in the sea water (e.g., Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and etc.) may be affecting the performance of AE 200 polymer by salt poisoning. In this case, the salt poisoning effect was observed to be more serious for Ca2+ than Na+. To treat out the Ca2+ ions, 0.2 lb/bbl of soda ash (Na2CO3) was added to the mud with excellent results. It was observed that the dilution factor increased back to 20, and the texture of the solid was also more like the fresh water mud.}",
