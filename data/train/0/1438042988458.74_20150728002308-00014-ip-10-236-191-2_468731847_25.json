I'm still trying to figure out some finer points of how exactly I want it to turn out, but it will happen!, 15352=Seemingly from 2008. Have almost no recollection of making. Very little work done, only movement system is in place and frankly I would recommend scrapping that. Also included are two images from 2005 that seem to be related., 61085=Here's a game I started on in 2009, when I played a lot of Sin & Punishment and wanted to make a top-down shooter but where you couldn't shoot bullets, you can only reflect them. I was going to have the player go room-to-room doing this (modeled after Legend of Zelda NES dungeons) and incorporate maybe some puzzles or something, but what I have here looks more like Space Invaders, which is also ok. In truth, I don't remember everything I wanted for this one., 31610=I am working on this and wanting to give it some more time. Probably finish it some time in the first week of January., 84827=From July 2010, made in AS3 with FlashPunk., 81310=From August 2009, written in AS3.}",
