Back in 2011, the lunch room was very modest, and pretty dull to be honest. The new updated 2012 room is more of a lounge or really large cafe. The food selection has grown, there are many tables, couches and chairs to lounge around on, plenty of vending machines, and an overall more relaxed environment, though it may become a bit loud a times. The food pricing is typical for any college; overpriced. In the end, I must applaud MCC for stepping their game up on this aspect., 409901=This is the place to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life. Take all the basic courses and figure out what subjects you enjoy the most. If you end up changing you're career then you only have to pay $1200 more instead of $12000 at most universities.}",
