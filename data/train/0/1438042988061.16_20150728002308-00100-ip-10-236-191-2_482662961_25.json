    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{71393=[0074] Screens in XUI are created by putting together containers and GUI components to be used by the built-in Layout Manager. This is done by creating a document definition inside a JSP file using XUI APIs (SAXUI). The GUI components come to life by declaring XUIOs (XUI Objects) written in SAXUI that work in conjunction with the Controller. XUIOs act as the intercepting agents that communicate with the Controller, which then delegates rendering control to the Layout Manager. Every component API has an XML Schema document associated with it to provide the rules as to how these elements are to be created. This ensures that developers will be guided as to how a tag should be declared. This ensures consistency between each reusable components and each page and consistency throughout the whole application. In the preferred embodiment, the W3C XML Schema Recommendation 2001 Version 1.0 is used., 64364=[0059] The XUI framework is designed to facilitate the creation and delivery of hypermedia documents for web applications with rich familiar GUI components such as menubars, toolbars, combo boxes, etc. that are typically found in traditional desktop applications. It pertains generally to a web application wherein the graphical user interface (GUI) have the ability to emulate the look-and-feel of standard windowing environments without using heavyweight technologies such as Motif, Microsoft MFC, Java Swing or AWT, but rather using standards-based lightweight technologies such as DHTML, HTML, JavaScript and CSS. XML technologies including XPath and XSL both can be used for server-side and client-side parsing. This feature of the present invention sharply contrasts with the approach represented in the conventional approach, for example, as described in U.S. Patent Application No. 2002/0085020, of Carroll, Thomas J. Jr., entitled \u201cXML-based Graphical User Interface Application Development Toolkit\u201d., 31482=[0001] This U.S. Patent Application claims the benefit of the priority filing date of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/405,511 filed on Aug. 23, 2002, entitled \u201cExtensible User Interface Framework and Development Environment\u201d by the same inventor., 36425=[0008] The typical process of creating GUI components for a web page is done through HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc. separately, and then importing them into a developed application through typical \u201cinclude\u201d statements or linking mechanisms. GUI data is normally bound or coupled with the GUI logic which normally makes the reuse of these GUI objects very difficult especially when working with multi-behavioral or multi-modal pages. One attempt to overcome these issues is disclosed, for example, in published U.S. Patent Application No. 2002/0085020, of Carroll, Thomas J. Jr., entitled \u201cXML-based Graphical User Interface Application Development Toolkit\u201d, which describes an approach to segregate the development of the user interface from the development of the underlying application logic (\u201cbusiness model\u201d). The application's graphical user interface is specified using an XML document as an application interface file. At the application's compile time, this application interface file is parsed, and the specifications therein are used to retrieve graphical screen components from an interface library to create the user interface (\u201cview\u201d). This approach of separating the development of then later processing interface generation in coordination with the business logic is commonly referred to as the MVC (Model-View-Controller) approach. However, the MVC approach has shortcomings in that developers are limited in composing UI components per request, and can exhibit polymorphic behavior with only limited flexibility., 189355=[0159] The Model or XUI Data pertains to any data used for processing containers, components, and other resources within the XUI framework. Most of XUI Data is used in with components as they need data to be used as labels for example. Data can come as different forms. For example, some XUI data are preformatted in a structured XML document with an associated XML schema document which formally describes the grammar as to how the document should be structured. It uses embeddable data sets wherein data to be used by GUI components can be created in a separate file which can then be embedded by URI reference inside component declarations. By the same token, structured data sets, conforming with the same schema can be literally and physically embedded inside the <xcomponent> opening and closing tags and then passed to the controller and GUI Factory for further parsing and processing.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0183] While certain preferred embodiments of the invention have been described, it is intended that all embodiments, variations, and modifications thereof within the spirit and scope of the disclosed principles be deemed included within the present invention, as defined in the appended claims. [0182] In summary, the present invention provides a method for web application development that enables rich GUIs to be built using the XUI Framework for creating a number of complementary, interacting GUI-managing components written in simple declarative format and coordinating their functions through a Controller in the Extended-Model-View-Controller approach. The XUI Framework employs reusable and extendable or extensible user interface (UI) content objects exhibiting polymorphic behavior. The view management components can be formulated in simple XML, XSL, DHTML, XHTML, and HTML statements, which can readily be handled by JavaScript and CSS for client-side processing, and XML technologies and Java Technologies for server-side processing, thereby avoiding the use of heavyweight technologies such as Java Swing and AWT. The GUI-managing components are designed to create GUIs that have a \u201cdeliberate kinship\u201d to existing GUI development environments in order to emulate the techniques, patterns, conventions and standards familiar to a broad base of users. Web applications can be developed with a set of rich GUIs that naturally produces a similar user experience as found in conventional client or desktop applications, while providing a huge improvement in performance, flexibility, scalability and manageability",
