One type is sold by DSM under the brand name of Parsol 1789. 4-tert-butyl-4'-methoxy dibenzoyl methane is solid at normal temperature and pressure. It crystallizes and precipitates easily and in a formulation 4-tert-butyl-4'-methoxy dibenzoyl methane presents similar problems to those of diethyl amino hydroxy benzoyl hexyl benzoate., 139666=\u00a9 2004-2015 FreePatentsOnline.com.

    "textBeforeTable": "Fig. 1 shows a structural formula of an octyl hydroxy stearate oligomer. Fig. 2 shows an infrared absorption spectrum of a dimer of octyl hydroxy stearate oligomer. Table 1 shows a comparison of the characteristic values of octyl hydroxy stearate oligomers (dimer to heptamer) used in the present invention against the characteristic values of octyl hydroxy stearate (monomer) and octyl hydroxy stearate oligomer (octamer) which are not included in the scope of the present invention. The octyl hydroxy stearate oligomer used in the present invention is obtained by hydrogenating caster oil to obtain 12-hydroxy stearate, and then causing this 12-hydroxy stearate to self-condensate into a hydroxy stearate oligomer, and finally octylating this hydroxy stearate oligomer. The octyl hydroxy stearate oligomer itself has not been synthesized, and the inventors of the present invention are the first to find utility in these oligomers. Traditionally, octyl hydroxy stearate (or strictly \"octyl hydroxy stearate monomer\") has a structure where n is 1, while the octyl hydroxy stearate oligomer used in the present invention is a dimer to heptamer and thus has a different molecule structure unit. The present invention is a cosmetic material characterized in that it uses one or more",
