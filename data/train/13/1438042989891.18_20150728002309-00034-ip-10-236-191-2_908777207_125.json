            "I'm not really sure there are any.",
            "It's a state school, I pay the same here I would pay to go to school in state which is nice. I think what I pay makes sense in the economy at whatever but I don't think everything is a 30 thousand dollar school",
            "The campus has lots of things to do and Corvallis has it's charm. Less to do than in a major city but it's a college town.",
            "Very typical dorm/college/cafeteria type food but they always have vegetarian options and it is affordable.",
            "McNary is pretty sketch... But some of the other dorms are great. I encourage people to research the dorms.",
            "So far academics have been easy here for me. But I am taking mostly general core classes.",
            "Apply early, visit the school, be sure that this is where you will be happiest. Even the greatest school isn't the right one if you aren't happy.",
            "Oregon State offers a wonderful campus environment. It has top of the line facilities with professors who are very skilled. Plus it's got a great D1 College Life feel."

Food options aren't all that great, but food from the dining halls are relatively cheap and taste good. The most expensive options are in the MU (Togo's, Carl's Jr., Panda Express), but you can also find Bueno's Burritos which gives you a massive burrito for really cheap, plus there's hardly ever a long line, even at 12:30 PM on a weekday., 671018=Its winner of the prestigious 2009 Ivy Award.

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Some of my teachers simply did not teach in a style that worked for me. Sometimes even the information I learned in classes I found to be completely irrelevant and worthless to my learning needs. It took a long time to adjust and honestly I would have to say high school did not prepare us enough for the change. When sitting in lectures with 200+ students in them you can find yourself easily distracted, especially when you do not always get the chance to ask questions if you are confused or understand what you are doing wrong. Fortunately once you learn how to affectively use your time it will become easier to adapt your learning style and use the resources available to you.
