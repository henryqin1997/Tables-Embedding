    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{59600=Injuries had devastated the Maryland roster the previous year,[38][39][40] and while 2008 was more forgiving by comparison, several key players were injured. Starting cornerback Kevin Barnes suffered a season-ending scapular fracture against Wake Forest and missed the last six games.[41] Sophomore LaQuan Williams and true freshman Kevin Dorsey, both wide receivers, sat out the entire season due to leg and foot injuries, respectively.[42] Leading receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey sat out the Boston College game due to a calf injury, and leading rusher Da'Rel Scott suffered a left shoulder injury in the third game against California, which plagued him throughout the season, although he missed just one game. Running back Morgan Green, who had contended for the starting position during summer camp, had an injury-riddled season, before seeing his first real action in the bowl game.[43] Starting quarterback Jordan Steffy was put out for the season by a thumb injury on his throwing hand in the first game.[44], 15232=The 2008 season in the ACC was described as chaotic, and for Maryland, there was no exception.[2][3] The Terrapins were within grasp of the ACC Atlantic Division championship at the end of Week 12, but lost their final two games and fell to a four-way tie for third place. Maryland closed the regular season with a 7\u20135 record\u2014including four wins against Top 25-ranked teams\u2014which was enough to secure bowl eligibility. In the postseason, Maryland defeated Nevada of the Western Athletic Conference in the Humanitarian Bowl., 128419=It was the first time Maryland was shut out since 2004, when they were similarly defeated by Virginia in Charlottesville, 16\u20130.[60] It was Maryland's worst shutout loss since losing to Virginia in 1997, 45\u20130, and the largest margin of loss since losing to Virginia Tech in 2004, 55\u20136.[61], 13816=Ralph Friedgen led the team for his eighth season as head coach and was assisted by first-year offensive coordinator James Franklin and third-year defensive coordinator Chris Cosh. It was the first season since the departure of Charlie Taaffe in 2005 that Friedgen did not call the offensive plays himself. Instead, those duties were handled by Franklin, a former Maryland wide receivers coach, who returned after a brief stint at Kansas State and in the National Football League (NFL). With him, Franklin brought a new system: the West Coast offense. Cosh, whose complex defensive scheme had been criticized as too passive, resigned at the end of the season., 111718=The Maryland offense scored five touchdowns against California, which bettered the combined total of four in the Terrapins' first two games. California running back Jahvid Best, an early Heisman Trophy contender,[56] ran for 311\u00a0yards in his first two games, but was held to 25\u00a0yards on 10\u00a0carries against Maryland. In total, California's rushing offense was held to 38\u00a0yards.[53] This was the first of four Maryland victories over ranked opponents during the 2008 season.[12], 40514=There was some controversy[27] at the start of the season when head coach Ralph Friedgen selected senior Jordan Steffy as the starting quarterback over junior Chris Turner. In 2007, when Steffy suffered a concussion against 10th-ranked Rutgers, the relatively untested Turner took over and led Maryland to an upset victory. He then started the remainder of the season, compiled a 4\u20135 record in games he started, and led another upset against eighth-ranked Boston College. In comparing the practice performances of Steffy, Turner, and third-stringer Josh Portis, offensive coordinator James Franklin said:[28], 108634=The game began with a Maryland kickoff to California, who were stopped for a net loss of 4\u00a0yards and forced to punt. On Maryland's first possession, it mounted a 60-yard drive that culminated in a 24-yard touchdown rush by Da'Rel Scott. California quarterback Kevin Riley then threw an interception to cornerback Kevin Barnes, which allowed Scott to rush for his second score of the game. California made a field goal, but on the following series, Maryland drove 60\u00a0yards and tight end Dan Gronkowski made a touchdown reception. The Golden Bears made another field goal to end the first half with a score of 21\u20136, in Maryland's favor.[53] During the second quarter, Riley threw a short screen pass to running back Jahvid Best, who immediately received a hard hit from Maryland cornerback Kevin Barnes. While still lying on the field, Best rolled to his side to vomit.[54] Footage of the tackle and its aftermath circulated widely on the internet and became a viral video phenomenon.[55] In the third period, Chris Turner completed a pass to Darrius Heyward-Bey for a 27-yard touchdown to end the quarter with Maryland in the lead, 28\u20136. In the final period, California scored two touchdowns against a preventative defense, before Maryland responded with a fifth score on a one-yard rush by Davin Meggett. In the final minutes, Maryland placekicker Obi Egekeze missed a 27-yard field goal which would have clinched the victory. Instead, California scored a third touchdown to close within eight points. With 1:55 remaining to play, California attempted an onside kick, but it bounced out of bounds, and Maryland was able to run out the clock to win the upset, 35\u201328.[53], 159576=Maryland entered the game having been knocked out of the running for the Atlantic Division title the previous week, but able to play spoiler for Boston College. The Eagles were playing to earn a berth to the ACC Championship Game for the second consecutive year. Additionally, competing within a closely contested ACC, Maryland could have greatly improved its standing for bowl selection with an eighth win. The Eagles were the fifth ranked team to face Maryland. The Terrapins were, to that point, 4\u20130 against top-25 opposition and the only team to beat four ranked opponents in 2008. Boston College was fielding second-string quarterback Dominique Davis in his first career appearance. He replaced starter Chris Crane, who had suffered a broken collarbone the previous week.[70], 34489=The 2008 recruiting class was ranked 52nd in the nation by Scout.com and 38th by Rivals.com.[14][15] Scout.com rated three recruits as four-star and six as three-star prospects, while Rivals.com rated six recruits each as four-star and three-star prospects.[14][15] Kenny Tate, who was originally recruited as a wide receiver, was the only four-star prospect to see significant playing time in 2008. Before the season, he was converted to safety, a position that had been attrited by the graduation of former starters Christian Varner and J.J. Justice, and Tate also saw action on special teams.[16] Cornerback Cameron Chism, who saw action in nine games as a reserve, recorded seven tackles on kickoff returns to tie for second on the team in special teams tackles.[17] Tight end Matt Furstenburg saw limited play time on special teams against Delaware and Middle Tennessee, but injured his foot and was awarded a medical redshirt.[18][19] Wide receiver Kevin Dorsey also sat out the season as a redshirt to recuperate from foot surgery.[20] The other four-star recruits who sat out on redshirt status were wide receiver Kerry Boykins, tight end Devonte Campbell, and defensive tackle Masengo Kabongo.[21][22] Running back Davin Meggett, the son of former New York Giants star Dave Meggett, was the only true freshman to start a game for Maryland in 2008, and he was a significant contributor throughout the season. Meggett was not a highly touted recruit, assessed by Scout.com as a two-star prospect,[23] and his only other scholarship offers were from local-area Division I FCS schools.[24] In 2008, however, he led all ACC freshman with 5.13\u00a0yards per carry,[25] and Megett finished the season with 457\u00a0yards and four touchdowns as a reserve.[26], 12707=The 2008 Maryland Terrapins football team represented the University of Maryland in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) college football season. It was the Terrapins' (also officially known as the \"Terps\") 56th season as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and its fourth within the framework of the ACC Atlantic Division., 46327=Maryland also played four non-conference games. For the season opener, the Terrapins met the 2007 Division I FCS runners-up, Delaware.[34] California of the Pacific-10 Conference was played for the first time in school history as the first half of a home-and-home series. Athletic director Deborah Yow wanted to play one of the University of Maryland's five academic peer institutions,[35] and to take a two-year hiatus from the 28-year series against West Virginia. She said, by adding California, \"We weren't trying to add to the degree of difficulty [of Maryland's schedule]; we were trying to substitute for West Virginia.\"[36] Games were also played against Middle Tennessee State of the Sun Belt Conference and Eastern Michigan of the Mid-American Conference.[37] For the 2008 Humanitarian Bowl, Maryland played Nevada in the teams' first meeting., 97396=Delaware kicked off to start the game, and wide receiver Torrey Smith returned the ball 23\u00a0yards to the Maryland 32-yard line. Quarterback Jordan Steffy then led a Maryland drive, but the series ended when placekicker Obi Egekeze missed a 48-yard field goal attempt. On the next Maryland possession, Egekeze missed another field goal attempt, this time of 45\u00a0yards. The teams then exchanged several punts before Maryland took over on the Delaware 48-yard line. Steffy completed a 36-yard pass to Darrius Heyward-Bey, which set up a 12-yard touchdown rush also by Heyward-Bey. Delaware drove 44\u00a0yards, but then missed their own 46-yard field goal attempt. With 3:33 left in the half, Steffy engineered a 47-yard drive to set up a 41-yard field goal attempt, which Egekeze missed for the third time. On the first play of the second half, Delaware quarterback Rob Schoenhoft threw an interception to cornerback Kevin Barnes, who returned it 10\u00a0yards to the Delaware 46-yard line. On the next play, Steffy threw an interception to Erik Johnson, who returned it to the Maryland 49-yard line. The Terrapins' next possession ended when, fourth and 18, Steffy threw another interception at the Delaware one-yard line. Incidentally, this put the Blue Hens in worse field position than if the Terrapins had turned over on downs. Soon after, Delaware punted the ball away. Running back Da'Rel Scott then rushed for a 30-yard gain, which set up a 14-yard touchdown run by running back Davin Meggett. Chris Turner took over as Maryland's quarterback on the second series of the fourth quarter after Steffy fractured his right thumb. On Delaware's subsequent possession, Schoenhoft engineered an 80-yard drive, which culminated with a one-yard touchdown rush by running back Johnathan Smith. With 3:20 on the clock, Schoenhoft threw an interception to safety Terrell Skinner. Turner then scrambled for a first down, and Scott converted for a second first down, which allowed Maryland to run out the game clock. Maryland won, with a final score of 14\u20137.[48], 137049=The Wolfpack lost its fourth straight game to remain the only ACC team winless in conference play (ACC: 0\u20134). The favorite Terrapins once again struggled against an underdog opponent, but managed to edge the Wolfpack and secure a sixth win for bowl eligibility. With it, Maryland was ranked for the first time since 2006, at 25th on the Associated Press and USA Today Coaches' Poll rankings. Interestingly, the fan poll ESPNU Allstate Standings had the Terrapins ranked 14th in the nation, ahead of AP first-ranked Texas and fourth-ranked Oklahoma.[64], 166763=Maryland achieved bowl eligibility through its sixth win against NC State. The Terrapins finished the regular season with a 7\u20135\u00a0overall record and 4\u20134\u00a0record against ACC opponents. Maryland's conference record was identical to four other ACC teams, and the league fielded an NCAA record of ten bowl-eligible teams.[72] For the 2008 season, there were eight non-Bowl Championship Series (BCS) bowl games with ACC tie-ins: the Gator Bowl, the Chick-fil-A Bowl, the Champs Sports Bowl, the Music City Bowl, the Humanitarian Bowl, the Emerald Bowl, the Meineke Car Care Bowl, and the EagleBank Bowl.[73], 136572=With 4:50 remaining on the clock, and the ball on their own eight-yard line, Maryland drove 89\u00a0yards to the Wolfpack three-yard line, which included a pass to Davin Meggett for 31\u00a0yards. This set up a 20-yard field goal attempt by Obi Egekeze with eight\u00a0seconds on the clock. The kick was good and put Maryland ahead for good, 27\u201324.[64], 25157=In December 2007, Maryland hired Kansas State offensive coordinator James Franklin to serve in that same role for the Terrapins.[4] From 2000 to 2004, he was the Maryland wide receivers coach. In 2003 and 2004, he also served as the recruiting coordinator, and Rivals.com ranked Franklin as one of the nation's top-25 recruiters both years.[5] Because of the arrival of Franklin, 2008 was the first since 2005 that head coach Ralph Friedgen did not call the offensive plays himself.[4] At Maryland, Franklin installed a West Coast offense, which was well suited to quarterback Chris Turner's playing style and an experienced wide receiver corps that included play-maker Darrius Heyward-Bey and sure-handed Danny Oquendo.[6], 191398=Five former Maryland players were selected in the 2009 NFL Draft, which tied North Carolina for the most of any Atlantic Coast Conference team.[95] Wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey, who ran the fastest 40-yard dash time at the combine of 4.30\u00a0seconds,[96] was selected by the Oakland Raiders as the seventh overall pick, far higher than most analysts had anticipated.[97][98] Cornerback Kevin Barnes, who had scored the highest grade on the intelligence test at the combine, was selected in the third round by the Washington Redskins.[99] Linebacker Moise Fokou,[100] guard Jaimie Thomas,[101] and tight end Dan Gronkowski were all selected in the seventh round.[102], 180771=In Week 9, after defeating Wake Forest to improve to a 6\u20131 record, Maryland was ranked 25th by both the Associated Press and the Coaches' Polls. It was the first time the team was ranked since Week 11 in 2006.[84] Maryland would rise in the polls, and enter the Harris and BCS rankings after beating NC State the following week. However, after the loss to Virginia Tech, the Terps fell out of the rankings altogether. Maryland made one final poll appearance after the win over North Carolina, before losing to Florida State., 149916=Boston College (ACC: 3\u20133) could travel to the ACC Championship Game if they won out by beating both Wake Forest and Maryland. Boston College eventually did just that, and lost to Virginia Tech in the 2008 ACC Championship Game. Florida State (ACC: 4\u20133) would have won the Atlantic Division if they beat Maryland, Maryland beat Boston College, and Boston College beat Wake Forest. Under those circumstances, Florida State would have finished with a 5\u20133\u00a0record, tied with Maryland. Florida State would win the tiebreaker because they had defeated Maryland head-to-head. As it happened, Maryland lost to Boston College, which relegated Florida State to a second-place finish in the division. Wake Forest (ACC: 4\u20133) would have won the division if they won their last game against Boston College, and both Florida State and Boston College beat Maryland. In that case, Florida State and Wake Forest would have had identical conference records (ACC: 5\u20133), and Wake Forest would have won the tiebreaker because they defeated Florida State earlier in the season.[67], 43510=The Sagarin computer rating system calculated Maryland's strength of schedule to be 36th-most difficult out of the 245 Division I teams.[31] The Cosgrove Computer Rankings calculated it as the 56th-most difficult out of the 120 Division I FBS teams.[32] In accordance with conference rules, Maryland faced all five Atlantic Division opponents: Boston College, Clemson, Florida State, NC State, and Wake Forest. They also faced three Coastal Division opponents: official ACC rival Virginia, North Carolina, and Virginia Tech.[33] Virginia Tech and Boston College were the ACC champions and runners-up, respectively, in 2007 and again in 2008. Maryland did not play ACC opponents Duke, Georgia Tech, and Miami., 96712=The previous season, Delaware finished as the Division I FCS championship runners-up and scored more than 40\u00a0points in seven of 15\u00a0games. However, their star quarterback, Joe Flacco, and running back, Omar Cuff, both graduated and went on to the NFL.[46] Later in the season, the Blue Hens finished 2008 with eight losses for the first time in school history.[47], 162582=The second half started off with traded punts. Boston College took over with excellent field position on the Maryland 34-yard line, but was held to fourth and eight yards on the Terrapins' nine-yard line. The Eagles faked a field goal attempt, and holder Billy Flutie, nephew of Heisman winner Doug Flutie, rolled right and passed to Jordon McMichael for a nine-yard touchdown. The teams traded punts again, before Turner led the Terrapins on a 70-yard drive into the final quarter. A 13-yard reception by Danny Oquendo brought the score to 21\u201314. Boston College was then held three-and-out and punted. The Terrapins drove to the Eagles' 19-yard line, but Obi Egekeze missed the 36-yard field goal attempt. Boston College's next drive consisted of ten rush attempts by Montel Harris and burned three minutes off the clock. The Eagles punted and Turner completed three passes to advance to their own 35-yard line. Linebacker Robert Francois intercepted a pass and ran it 36\u00a0yards into the endzone. Steve Aponavicius's extra point brought it to 28\u201314. With 1:42 left, Turner completed eight passes including an 8-yard touchdown toss to Torrey Smith. With 0:14\u00a0remaining in the game, Maryland attempted an onside kick, but it bounced out of bounds. Boston College took possession and ran out the clock to end the game, 28\u201321.[70], 147849=The victory was Maryland's sixth consecutive against ranked opponents, which set a new school record. At the time, Maryland was the only team in the nation with four wins over ranked opponents during the 2008 season. Only BCS National Championship Game participants Florida and Oklahoma would later finish with more wins against ranked teams. Maryland also improved their home record to 6\u20130\u00a0for the season. Head coach Ralph Friedgen improved his record against North Carolina to 5\u20131, and kept North Carolina winless in College Park since 1997.[66], 27473=Maryland lost several important players from the 2007 team. In January 2008, shortly after Oregon State defeated Maryland in the Emerald Bowl, linebacker Erin Henderson announced that he would forgo his senior year to enter the 2008 NFL Draft.[7] Henderson, the brother of Butkus and Bednarik Award winner E.J., had recorded an ACC-high four fumble recoveries in 2007 and was the Terrapins' leader in total tackles (133) and tackles for loss (11).[8] The defensive line lost tackles Dre Moore and Carlos Feliciano, while the secondary unit lost both starting safeties, strong safety Christian Varner and free safety J. J. Justice, as well as cornerback Isaiah Gardner.[9][10] The Maryland offense lost tailbacks Lance Ball and Keon Lattimore who combined for 1,573\u00a0rushing yards and 25\u00a0touchdowns in 2007.[11] The offensive line saw the departure of tight ends Jason Goode and Joey Haynos, and offensive guard Andrew Crummey.[9][10], 31820=Despite the loss of some of the previous year's important players, Maryland entered the 2008 season with a seasoned squad. Forty-six of sixty-two lettermen returned (74\u00a0percent),[12] which included ten offensive and six defensive starters. The 2008 team contained 31 seniors, which was the largest group since Friedgen became head coach in 2001.[13] Important returnees on the defensive unit included cornerback Kevin Barnes, who recorded four interceptions in 2007; defensive end Jeremy Navarre, who had recorded 5.5 sacks; and linebacker Dave Philistin, who had recorded 124 tackles. The offense's returning statistical leaders included quarterback Chris Turner, who threw for 1,958\u00a0passing yards in 2007; wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey, who had 786\u00a0receiving yards; and running back Da'Rel Scott, who had 135\u00a0rushing yards.[9][10], 122858=The upset marked the fourth consecutive Maryland win against a ranked opponent (the others: #23 Cal, and, in the 2007 season, #8 Boston College and #10 Rutgers). It was also the fourth consecutive time that the visiting team has won the Maryland\u2013Clemson series.[59], 171117=On December 7, 2008, Maryland accepted a bid to play in the Roady's Humanitarian Bowl against Nevada. The Western Athletic Conference (WAC) team likewise finished with a 7\u20135 record. Nevada was ranked the number-five total offense and number-two rushing offense in the nation with 510.6\u00a0total yards per game. In 2008, running back Vai Taua ran for 1,420\u00a0and quarterback Colin Kaepernick for 1,115\u00a0yards, and the latter threw for an additional 2,479\u00a0yards.[79][80] The Humanitarian Bowl executive director, Kevin McDonald, said, \"We look forward to welcoming a Maryland [team] that defeated four Top 25 opponents and spent three weeks ranked ... Nevada comes in having played two teams, Texas Tech and Missouri, that were then ranked nationally in the top ten. They also gave ninth-ranked Boise State their toughest [WAC] game.\"[80][81], 188305=After the bowl game, in February 2009, the athletic department named offensive coordinator James Franklin the \"head coach-in-waiting\", meaning that he would be the eventual successor to Ralph Friedgen.[91] Upon the expiration of Friedgen's contract in January 2012, Franklin will be offered the position or paid a US$1\u00a0million contractual buyout. In June 2009, Friedgen said he might like to stay an additional two years past his current contract, but athletic director Deborah Yow responded that the school could not afford the buyout. She said that any extension would have to be worked out between Friedgen and Franklin.[92], 132491=Ralph Friedgen stated that \"We finally put a full game together. I think by far it's the best we've played all year.\" It was Maryland's fifth consecutive defeat of a ranked opponent, and the third of the season, making them 3\u20130 against ranked opponents, but just 2\u20132 against all others. The game also marked the first time that Wake Forest had been held scoreless in 124\u00a0games when it lost to Air Force in 1998, and it was the first time since 1957 that the Terrapins had bounced back to shut out an opponent following a shutout of their own. The last Maryland shutout of a ranked opponent was in 1955 against UCLA.[62], 185711=At the end of the regular season, but before the postseason bowl game, Maryland lost two members of its coaching staff. On December 5, 2008, the school announced that defensive coordinator Chris Cosh would return to Kansas State to take over as assistant coach and co-defensive coordinator. He joined the staff of the recently re-hired Bill Snyder, who was Kansas State's head coach from 1996 to 2005. Cosh previously served under Snyder as his linebackers coach from 2004 to 2005.[85][86] For the bowl game, Maryland appointed outside linebackers coach Al Seamonson as the interim defensive coordinator.[87] Maryland also lost its special teams and tight ends coach, Danny Pearman, who was hired by new Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney. Pearman was a Clemson alumnus and played there as a tight end from 1984 to 1987. At Alabama, he coached special teams and the offensive and defensive tackles from 1990 to 1997,[88][89] during which time Swinney played there as a wide receiver.[90] For Maryland's bowl game, third-year intern Brian White acted as interim tight ends coach, and he assisted head coach Ralph Friedgen in directing the special teams.[87]}",
