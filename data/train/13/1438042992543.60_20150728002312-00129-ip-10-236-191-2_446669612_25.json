            "ERGONOMIC COMPUTER MOUSE - A computer mouse for use with a computing device is provided. The computer mouse may include a mouse body with an ulnar side digit support structure having a front concave region and a rear convex region formed proximate and behind the front concave region. The front concave region may include an overhang portion on a top side and an outwardly flared region on a bottom side. The front concave region may be sized to receive a distal end of a digit of a user, and the rear convex region may be sized to support a proximate end of a digit of a user. The mouse body may additionally include a radial side digit support structure that has a concave region with an outwardly flared region on a bottom side of the concavity.",

A framework allows libraries to be identified as partial trust callers allowed to indicate that the libraries are allowed to be called from partially trusted code by default. The framework allows libraries to be identified as partial trust callers enabled to indicate the libraries could be called from partially trusted code, but not by default. A hosting application is notified that a particular library has been loaded. If the particular library has been identified as partial trust callers allowed, then a determination is received from the hosting application on whether to remove or keep partial trust accessibility for the particular library. If the particular library has been identified as partial trust callers enabled, then a determination is received from the hosting application on whether or not to enable partial trust accessibility for the particular library. 20080282315 Published Description Patent application number Stephen Fisher, Kenmore, WA US 07-11-2013 ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING NETWORK SERVICES - To provide remote services, including dynamic, interactive assistance to electric vehicle (EV) users, a central server is arranged for electronic communications with EVs ( 20130179057 Published Description Patent application number Sheldon Fisher, Sammamish, WA US 07-11-2013 USER INTERFACE FOR MOBILE DEVICE - Disclosed are",
    "textAfterTable": "Steven Fisher, Edmonds, WA US Patent application number Description Published 20090218512 ULTRAVIOLET TREATMENT DEVICE - A keyboard and touchpad or mouse UV treatment system with optical sensor and inclined slide is described. A proximity sensor, microcontroller firmware, and motorized mechanism allow activation of the sanitization cycle by personnel with contaminated hands without risk of additional spreading of pathogens to other personnel and patients. The inclined slide provides stability when operated on a desk, and the microcontroller and optical sensor determine the proper exposure time to compensate for lamp aging and variations in lamp output. 09-03-2009 Steven W. Fisher, Bothell, WA US Patent application number Description Published 20120086640 User Notification System with an Illuminated Computer Input Device - A user notification system and a computer input device, such as a mouse. The computer input device includes an illumination member that enables a user to quickly and accurately position the input device during poor lighting conditions and determine whether the computer is ON. The input device includes a housing and an illumination device that is supported by the housing. Illumination from the illumination device is visible when the input device is placed on a support surface. The illumination member is also used to notify the user if one or more of various events have occurred in a computer application being run on the computer. The notification information is presented to the user",
