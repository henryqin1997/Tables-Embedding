    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{302986=Prior to January 1, 2012, the Fund will choose a standing (default) tax lot identification method for all shareholders. A tax lot identification method is the way the Fund will determine which specific shares are deemed to be sold when there are multiple purchases on different dates at differing net asset values, and the entire position is not sold at one time. The Fund\u2019s standing tax lot identification method is the method covered shares will be reported on your Consolidated Form 1099 if you do not select a specific tax lot identification method. You may choose a method different than the Fund\u2019s standing method and will be able to do so at the time of your purchase or upon the sale of covered shares. Please refer to the appropriate Internal Revenue Service regulations or consult your tax advisor with regard to your personal circumstances. Prior to January 1, 2012, the Fund's shareholders will be notified as to which default tax lot identification method the Fund will use., 391482=SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS AND TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS. To the extent consistent with its investment policies, each Fund may invest in short-term instruments, including money market instruments, on an ongoing basis to provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money market instruments are generally short-term investments that may include but are not limited to: (i) shares of money market funds; (ii) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities (including government-sponsored enterprises); (iii) negotiable certificates of deposit (\u201cCDs\u201d), bankers\u2019 acceptances, fixed time deposits, bank notes and other obligations of U.S. and foreign banks (including foreign branches) and similar institutions; (iv) commercial paper rated at the date of purchase \u201cPrime-1\u201d by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d), \u201cA-1\u201d by Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Service (\u201cS&P\u201d) or, if unrated, of comparable quality as determined by the Adviser; (v) non-convertible corporate debt securities (e.g., bonds and debentures) with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of not more than 397 days and that satisfy the rating requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase agreements; and (vii) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of foreign banks (including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion of the Adviser, are of comparable quality to obligations of U.S. banks which may be purchased by a Fund. Any of these instruments may be purchased on a current or a forward-settled basis., 281626=Dividends from net investment income, including any net foreign currency gains, generally are declared and paid at least annually and any net realized securities gains are distributed at least annually. To improve tracking error or comply with the distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, dividends may be declared and paid more frequently than annually for the Funds., 674213=Beginning in 2011, if a RIC fails this asset-diversification test, such RIC, in addition to other cure provisions previously permitted, has a 6-month period to correct any failure without incurring a penalty if such failure is \u201cde minimis,\u201d meaning that the failure does not exceed the lesser of 1% of the RIC\u2019s assets, or $10 million. Such cure right is similar to that previously and currently permitted for a REIT., 554500=Each of the Supervision and Administration Agreement and the related Investment Advisory Agreement remains in effect for two (2) years from its effective date and thereafter continues in effect for as long as its continuance is specifically approved at least annually, by (1) the Board of Trustees of the Trust, or by the vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding shares of the Fund, and (ii) by the vote of a majority of the Trustees of the Trust who are not parties to the Investment Advisory Agreement or interested persons of the Adviser, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval. Each of the Supervision and Administration Agreement and the related Investment Advisory Agreement provides that it may be terminated at any time without the payment of any penalty, by the Board of Trustees of the Trust or by vote of a majority of the Funds\u2019 shareholders, on 60 calendar days written notice to the Adviser, and by the Adviser on the same notice to the Trust and that it shall be automatically terminated if it is assigned., 400780=Some transactions are entered into on a net basis, i.e., the two payment streams are netted out, with a Fund receiving or paying, as the case may be, only the net amount of the two payments. A Fund will enter into equity swaps only on a net basis. Payments may be made at the conclusion of an equity swap contract or periodically during its term. Equity swaps do not involve the delivery of securities or other underlying assets. Accordingly, the risk of loss with respect to equity swaps is limited to the net amount of payments that such Fund is contractually obligated to make. If the other party to an equity swap, or any other swap entered into on a net basis, defaults, a Fund\u2019s risk of loss consists of the net amount of payments that such Fund is contractually entitled to receive, if any. In contrast, other transactions may involve the payment of the gross amount owed. For example, currency swaps usually involve the delivery of the entire principal amount of one designated currency in exchange for the other designated currency. Therefore, the entire principal value of a currency swap is subject to the risk that the other party to the swap will default on its contractual delivery obligations. To the extent that the amount payable by a Fund under a swap is covered by segregated cash or liquid assets, the Fund and the Adviser believe that transactions do not constitute senior securities under the 1940 Act and, accordingly, will not treat them as being subject to a Fund\u2019s borrowing restrictions., 705304=Commodities. In August, 2011, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) announced that it would stop issuing private letter rulings authorizing favorable tax treatment for funds that invest indirectly in commodities or derivatives based upon commodities. The IRS has previously issued a number of private letter rulings to funds in this area, concluding that such investments generate \u201cqualifying income\u201d for RIC qualification purposes. It is unclear how long this suspension will last. The IRS has not indicated that any previously issued rulings in this area will be affected by this suspension This suspension of guidance by the IRS means that the tax treatment of such investments is now subject to some uncertainty., 737808=As of January 1, 2012, federal law requires that mutual fund companies report their shareholders' cost basis, gain/loss, and holding period to the Internal Revenue Service on the Fund\u2019s shareholders\u2019 Consolidated Form 1099s when \u201ccovered\u201d securities are sold. Covered securities are any regulated investment company and/or dividend reinvestment plan shares acquired on or after January 1, 2012., 636090=To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant\u2019s agreement with the Distributor, the Trust will issue Creation Units to such Authorized Participant notwithstanding the fact that the corresponding Portfolio Deposits have not been received in part or in whole, in reliance on the undertaking of the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing Deposit Securities as soon as possible, which undertaking shall be secured by such Authorized Participant\u2019s delivery and maintenance of collateral having a value equal to 110%, which the Adviser may change from time to time, of the value of the missing Deposit Securities in accordance with the Trust\u2019s then-effective procedures. Such collateral must be delivered no later than 2:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the contractual settlement date. The only collateral that is acceptable to the Trust is cash in U.S. Dollars or an irrevocable letter of credit in form, and drawn on a bank, that is satisfactory to the Trust. The cash collateral posted by the Authorized Participant may be invested at the risk of the Authorized Participant, and income, if any, on invested cash collateral will be paid to that Authorized Participant. Information concerning the Trust\u2019s current procedures for collateralization of missing Deposit Securities is available from the Distributor. The Authorized Participant Agreement will permit the Trust to buy the missing Deposit Securities at any time and will subject the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the Trust of purchasing such securities and the cash collateral or the amount that may be drawn under any letter of credit., 436663=INVESTMENT COMPANIES. Each Fund may invest up to 5% of its assets in any single investment company and up to 10% of its assets in all other investment companies in the aggregate. However, no Fund can hold more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of any single investment company. When a Fund invests in another investment company, it bears a proportionate share of expenses charged by the investment company in which it invests. Investments by the Fund in other investment companies, including exchange-traded funds (\u201cETFs\u201d), will be subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act except as permitted by SEC orders. The Fund may rely on SEC orders that permit them to invest in certain ETFs beyond the limits contained in the 1940 Act, subject to certain terms and conditions. Generally, these terms and conditions require the Board to approve policies and procedures relating to certain of the Fund\u2019s investments in ETFs. These policies and procedures require, among other things, that (i) the Adviser conduct the Fund\u2019s investment in ETFs without regard to any consideration received by the Fund or any of its affiliated persons and (ii) the Adviser certify to the Board quarterly that it has not received any consideration in connection with an investment by the Fund in an ETF, or if it has, the amount and purpose of the consideration will be reported to the Board and an equivalent amount of advisory fees shall be waived by the Adviser., 687090=Distributions by each Fund of investment company taxable income (excluding any short-term capital gains) whether received in cash or shares will be taxable either as ordinary income or as qualified dividend income, eligible for the reduced maximum rate to individuals of 15% to the extent each Fund receives qualified dividend income on the securities it holds and such Fund designates the distribution as qualified dividend income. Qualified dividend income is, in general, dividend income from taxable domestic corporations and certain foreign corporations (e.g., foreign corporations incorporated in a possession of the United States or in certain countries with a comprehensive tax treaty with the United States, or the stock of which is readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States). A dividend will not be treated as qualified dividend income to the extent that (i) the shareholder has not held the shares on which the dividend was paid for more than 60 days during the 121-day period that begins on the date that is 60 days before the date on which the shares become ex dividend with respect to such dividend (and each Fund also satisfies those holding period requirements with respect to the securities it holds that paid the dividends distributed to the shareholder), (ii) the shareholder is under an obligation (whether pursuant to a short sale or otherwise) to make related payments with respect to substantially similar or related property, or (iii) the shareholder elects to treat such dividend as investment income under section 163(d)(4)(B) of the Code. Absent further legislation, the maximum 15% rate on qualified dividend income will not apply to dividends received in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012. Distributions by each Fund of its net short-term capital gains will be taxable as ordinary income. Capital gain distributions consisting of each Fund\u2019s net capital gains will be taxable as long-term capital gains., 629881=Timing of Submission of Purchase Orders. An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable purchase order no later than the earlier of (i) 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time or (ii) the closing time of the trading session on the relevant Fund\u2019s Exchange, on any Business Day in order to receive that Business Day\u2019s NAV., 1005374=In the calendar year 2012, the dates of regular holidays affecting the following securities markets present the worst-case redemption cycle for a Fund as follows:, 526065=In addition, the Board oversees the management of the Trust\u2019s risk management structure by the Adviser through its review of regular reports, presentations and other information from officers of the Trust and other persons.\u00a0\u00a0Senior officers of the Trust, including the Trust\u2019s CCO, regularly report to the Board on a range of matters, including those relating to risk management. In this regard, the Board periodically receives reports regarding the Trust\u2019s service providers, either directly or through the CCO. On at least a quarterly basis, the Independent Trustees meet with the CCO to discuss matters relating to the Trust\u2019s compliance program and, in accordance with Rule 38a-1 under the 1940 Act, the Board receives at least annually a written report from the CCO regarding the effectiveness of the Trust\u2019s compliance program. In connection with the CCO\u2019s annual Rule 38a-1 compliance report to the Board, the Independent Trustees meet with the CCO in executive session to discuss the Trust\u2019s compliance program., 533655=As of December 31, 2011, no Independent Trustee (or any of his immediate family members) owned beneficially or of record securities of any Trust investment adviser, its principal underwriter, or any person directly or indirectly, controlling, controlled by or under common control with any Trust investment adviser or principal underwriter., 751423=Dechert LLP, with offices at 1775 I Street Washington, DC 20006-2401, is counsel to the Independent Trustees of each Fund., 572017=The policy of the Trust regarding purchases and sales of securities is that primary consideration will be given to obtaining the most favorable prices and efficient executions of transactions. Consistent with this policy, when securities transactions are effected on a stock exchange, the Trust\u2019s policy is to pay commissions that are considered fair and reasonable without necessarily determining that the lowest possible commissions are paid in all circumstances. In seeking to determine the reasonableness of brokerage commissions paid in any transaction, the Adviser relies upon its experience and knowledge regarding commissions generally charged by various brokers and in various jurisdictions. The Adviser effects transactions for the Funds with those brokers and dealers that the Adviser believes provide the most favorable prices and are capable of providing the most efficient and best execution of trades. The primary consideration of the Adviser is to seek prompt execution of orders at the most favorable net price. The sale of Shares by a broker-dealer is not a factor in the selection of broker-dealers. The Adviser and its affiliates do not currently participate in any soft dollar transactions, although the Adviser relies on Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act in effecting or executing transactions for the Funds. Accordingly, in selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, the Adviser may consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act) provided to the Funds and/or other accounts over which the Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The Adviser may cause a Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Adviser to the Funds. Such brokerage and research services might consist of reports and statistics on specific companies or industries or broad overviews of the securities markets and the economy. Shareholders of the Funds should understand that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Adviser in connection with its services to other clients., 592185=Following the creation of the initial Creation Unit Aggregation(s) of a Fund and immediately prior to the commencement of trading in such Fund\u2019s shares, a holder of shares may be a \u201ccontrol person\u201d of the Fund, as defined in the 1940 Act. A Fund cannot predict the length of time for which one or more shareholders may remain a control person of the Fund., 479034=If a percentage limitation is satisfied at the time of investment, a later increase or decrease in such percentage resulting from a change in the value of a Fund\u2019s investments will not constitute a violation of such limitation, except that any borrowing by a Fund that exceeds the fundamental investment limitations stated above must be reduced to meet such limitations within the period required by the 1940 Act (currently three days). In addition, if a Fund\u2019s holdings of illiquid securities exceed 15% of net assets because of changes in the value of the Fund\u2019s investments, the Fund will take action to reduce its holdings of illiquid securities within a time frame deemed to be in the best interest of the Fund. Otherwise, a Fund may continue to hold a security even though it causes the Fund to exceed a percentage limitation because of fluctuation in the value of the Fund\u2019s assets., 722687=Certain individuals (and, if provided in future guidance, certain domestic entities) must disclose annually their interests in \u201cspecified foreign financial assets\u201d on IRS Form 8938, which must be attached to their U.S. federal income tax returns for taxable years beginning after March 18, 2010. The IRS has not yet released a copy of the Form 8938 and has suspended the requirement to attach Form 8938 for any taxable year for which an income tax return is filed before the release of Form 8938. Following Form 8938\u2019s release, individuals will be required to attach to their next income tax return required to be filed with the IRS a Form 8938 for each taxable year for which the filing of Form 8938 was suspended. Until the IRS provides more details regarding this reporting requirement, including in Form 8938 itself and related Treasury regulations, it remains unclear under what circumstances, if any, a shareholder\u2019s (indirect) interest in the Funds\u2019 \u201cspecified foreign financial assets,\u201d if any, will be required to be reported on this Form 8938., 310184=Investments that may be valued using fair value pricing include, but are not limited to: (i) an unlisted security related to corporate actions; (ii) a restricted security (i.e., one that may not be publicly sold without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d)); (iii) a security whose trading has been suspended or which has been de-listed from its primary trading exchange; (iv) a security that is thinly traded; (v) a security in default or bankruptcy proceedings for which there is no current market quotation; (vi) a security affected by currency controls or restrictions; and (vii) a security affected by a significant event (i.e., an event that occurs after the close of the markets on which the security is traded but before the time as of which the Fund\u2019s NAV is computed and that may materially affect the value of the Fund\u2019s investments). Examples of events that may be \u201csignificant events\u201d are government actions, natural disasters, armed conflict, acts of terrorism, and significant market fluctuations., 190387=Shares of the Funds May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV, 279726=The Board of Trustees of the Trust has adopted a distribution and services plan (\u201cPlan\u201d) pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act. Under the Plan, each Fund is authorized to pay distribution fees in connection with the sale and distribution of its Shares and pay service fees in connection with the provision of ongoing services to shareholders of each class and the maintenance of shareholder accounts in an amount up to 0.25% of its average daily net assets each year., 145916=Leverage: Each Fund may borrow money from a bank as permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (\u201c1940 Act\u201d), and as interpreted or modified by regulatory authority having jurisdiction, from time to time. For example, the Funds may borrow money at fiscal quarter ends to maintain the required level of diversification to qualify as a \u201cregulated investment company\u201d for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code., 269446=Jose Gonzalez: Jose Gonzalez has been Chief Operating Officer of the Adviser since March 2008. Mr. Gonzalez is also a registered representative of GWM Group, Inc. (\u201cGWM\u201d), a registered broker-dealer and an affiliate of the Adviser. Mr. Gonzalez has been affiliated with GWM since 2006., 438813=If required by the 1940 Act, the Fund expects to vote the shares of other investment companies that are held by it in the same proportion as the vote of all other holders of such securities., 699942=The tax treatment of certain futures contracts entered into by the Fund as well as listed non-equity options written or purchased by the Fund on U.S. exchanges (including options on futures contracts, equity indices and debt securities) will be governed by section 1256 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cSection\u00a01256 Contracts\u201d). Gains or losses on Section\u00a01256 Contracts generally are considered 60% long-term and 40% short-term capital gains or losses (\u201c60/40\u201d), although certain foreign currency gains and losses from such contracts may be treated as ordinary in character. Also, Section\u00a01256 Contracts held by the Fund at the end of each taxable year (and, for purposes of the 4% excise tax, on certain other dates as prescribed under the Internal Revenue Code) are \u201cmarked to market\u201d with the result that unrealized gains or losses are treated as though they were realized and the resulting gain or loss is treated as ordinary or 60/40 gain or loss, as applicable., 340522=Information about each Fund, including its reports and the Statement of Additional Information, has been filed with the SEC. It can be reviewed and copied at the SEC\u2019s Public Reference Room in Washington, DC or on the EDGAR database on the SEC\u2019s internet site (http://www.sec.gov). Information on the operation of the SEC\u2019s Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-202-551-8090. You can also request copies of these materials, upon payment of a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the SEC\u2019s e-mail address (publicinfo@sec.gov) or by writing the Public Reference section of the SEC, 100 F Street N.E., Room 1580, Washington DC, 20549-1520., 1582=Registration Statement Under The Securities Act Of 1933 \u00fe, 743619=The NAV for each Fund is calculated by deducting all of a Fund\u2019s liabilities (including accrued expenses) from the total value of its assets (including the securities held by the Fund plus any cash or other assets, including interest and dividends accrued but not yet received) and dividing the result by the number of shares outstanding, and generally rounded to the nearest cent, although each Fund reserves the right to calculate its NAV to more than two decimal places. The NAV for each Fund will generally be determined by SEI Global once daily Monday through Friday generally as of the regularly scheduled close of business of the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on each day that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that (a) any assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar shall be translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more major banks or dealers that makes a two-way market in such currencies (or a data service provider based on quotations received from such banks or dealers); and (b) U.S. fixed-income assets may be valued as of the announced closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments on any day that the Bond Market Association announces an early closing time., 224019=REIT stocks tend to be small- or mid-capitalization stocks and there is the possibility that returns from REITs may trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, these stocks have performed quite differently from the overall market. Real estate is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and developments, and characterized by intense competition and periodic overbuilding. Since 2007, the U.S. residential and commercial real estate markets generally have experienced a decline in value, with certain regions experiencing significant losses in property values. Exposure to real estate in these regions may adversely affect Fund performance., 339074=A Statement of Additional Information dated April 25, 2012, which contains more details about the Funds, is incorporated by reference in its entirety into this Prospectus, which means that it is legally part of this Prospectus., 614=Securities Act File No. 333-151713 Investment Company Act File No. 811-22209, 594162=Rule 18f-2 under the 1940 Act provides that any matter required by the provisions of the 1940 Act or applicable state law, or otherwise, to be submitted to the holders of the outstanding voting securities of an investment company such as the Trust shall not be deemed to have been effectively acted upon unless approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of each investment portfolio affected by such matter. Rule 18f-2 further provides that an investment portfolio shall be deemed to be affected by a matter unless the interests of each investment portfolio in the matter are substantially identical or the matter does not affect any interest of the investment portfolio. Under the Rule, the approval of an Investment Advisory Agreement, a distribution plan subject to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act or any change in the fundamental investment policy would be effectively acted upon with respect to an investment portfolio only if approved by a majority of the outstanding shares of such investment portfolio. However, the Rule also provides that the ratification of the appointment of independent accountants, the approval of principal underwriting contracts and the election of Trustees are exempt from the separate voting requirements stated above., 590046=Under the terms of the Declaration, each share of the Fund represents a proportionate interest in the particular Fund with each other share of its class in the same Fund and is entitled to such dividends and distributions out of the income belonging to the Fund as are authorized by the Trustees and declared by the Trust. Upon any liquidation of a Fund, shareholders of each class of a Fund are entitled to share pro rata in the net assets belonging to that class available for distribution. Shares do not have any preemptive or conversion rights. The right of redemption is described in the Prospectus. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the 1940 Act, the right of a shareholder to redeem shares and the date of payment by the Fund may be suspended for more than seven days (i) for any period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than the customary weekends or holidays, or trading in the markets the Fund normally utilizes is closed or is restricted as determined by the SEC, (ii) during any emergency, as determined by the SEC, as a result of which it is not reasonably practicable for the Fund to dispose of instruments owned by it or fairly to determine the value of its net assets, or (iii) for such other period as the SEC may by order permit for the protection of the shareholders of the Fund. The Trust also may suspend or postpone the recording of the transfer of its shares upon the occurrence of any of the foregoing conditions. In addition, shares of each Fund are redeemable at the unilateral option of the Trust. The Declaration permits the Board to alter the number of shares constituting a Creation Unit or to specify that shares of beneficial interest of the Trust may be individually redeemable. Shares when issued as described in the Prospectus are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. In the interests of economy and convenience, certificates representing shares of the Funds are not issued., 10626=April 25, 2012, 113560=The Underlying Index tracks the performance of REITs that rank among the highest yielding REITs globally, as determined by Structured Solutions AG (\u201cIndex Provider\u201d). As of March 31, 2012, the Underlying Index had 50 constituents, 35 of which are foreign companies.\u00a0The Fund\u2019s investment objective and Underlying Index may be changed without shareholder approval., 758757=The dates of the Regular Holidays in calendar year 2012 are:, 547313=INVESTMENT ADVISER. The Adviser, Global X Management Company LLC, serves as investment manager to the Funds pursuant to an Investment Advisory Agreement between the Trust and the Adviser. It is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC and is located at 399 Park Avenue, 32nd Floor New York, NY 10022. Bruno del Ama and Jose C. Gonzalez each own more than 25% of the outstanding shares of the Adviser, which was organized in Delaware on March 28, 2008 as a limited liability company., 342266=April 25, 2012, 218513=The Fund may be limited by provisions of the 1940Act that generally limit the amount the Fund can invest in any one closed-end fund, including any one BDC, to 3% of the closed-end fund's total outstanding stock. As a result, the Fund may hold a smaller position in a BDC than if it were not subject to this restriction. To comply with the provisions of the 1940 Act, on any matter upon which BDC shareholders are solicited to vote, the Sub-Adviser may be required to vote shares of the BDC held by the Fund in the same general proportion as shares held by other shareholders of the BDC. The Fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of any management and other operating expenses, and of any performance based or incentive fees, charged by the BDCs in which it invests, in addition to the expenses paid by the Fund., 268943=Bruno del Ama: Bruno del Ama has been Chief Executive Officer of the Adviser since March 2008. Prior to joining the Adviser, Mr. del Ama was a director at Radian Asset Assurance from 2004 to 2008. Mr. del Ama received a Masters in Business Administration from the Wharton Business School., 406789=ETFs that invest in commodities may be, or may become, subject to regulatory trading limits that could hurt the value of their securities and could affect the Fund\u2019s ability to pursue its investment program as described in this prospectus. Additionally, some ETFs are not registered under the Investment Company of 1940 Act and therefore, are not subject to the regulatory scheme and investor protections of the Investment Company Act of 1940., 586506=Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., located at 40 Water Street, Boston, MA 02109, serves as Custodian of Funds\u2019 assets. The custodian relationship is managed through SEI Global. As Custodian, Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. has agreed to (1) make receipts and disbursements of money on behalf of each Fund, (2) collect and receive all income and other payments and distributions on account of each Fund\u2019s portfolio investments, (3) respond to correspondence from shareholders, security brokers and others relating to its duties; and (4) make periodic reports to the Funds concerning the Fund\u2019s operations. Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. does not exercise any supervisory function over the purchase and sale of securities. As compensation for these services, the Custodian receives certain out-of-pocket costs, transaction fees and asset-based fees which are accrued daily and paid monthly by the Adviser from its fees., 654830=Orders to redeem Creation Unit Aggregations of funds based on foreign indexes must be delivered through an Authorized Participant that has executed an Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors other than Authorized Participants are responsible for making arrangements for a redemption request to be made through an Authorized Participant. An order to redeem Creation Unit Aggregations of the Fund is deemed received by the Trust on the Business Day if: (i) such order is received by the Fund\u2019s Distributor not later than the closing time of the applicable Exchange on the applicable Business Day; (ii) such order is accompanied or followed by the requisite number of shares of the Fund specified in such order, which delivery must be made through DTC to the Fund\u2019s Custodian no later than 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on the next Business Day following the day the order was transmitted; and (iii) all other procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement are properly followed. Deliveries of Fund securities to redeeming investors generally will be made within three Business Days. Due to the schedule of holidays in certain countries, however, the delivery of in-kind redemption proceeds for the Fund may take longer than three Business Days after the day on which the redemption request is received in proper form. In such cases, the local market settlement procedures will not commence until the end of the local holiday periods as described in Appendix A., 478553=Notwithstanding these fundamental investment restrictions, each Fund may purchase securities of other investment companies to the full extent permitted under Section 12 or any other provision of the 1940 Act (or any successor provision thereto) or under any regulation or order of the SEC., 344971=Dated April 25, 2012, 598912=The Declaration also authorizes the Trustees, in connection with the termination or other reorganization of the Trust or any series or class by way of merger, consolidation, the sale of all or substantially all of the assets, or otherwise, to classify the shareholders of any class into one or more separate groups and to provide for the different treatment of shares held by the different groups, provided that such termination or reorganization is approved by a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of each group of shareholders that are so classified., 620946=The Adviser makes available through the National Securities Clearing Corporation (\u201cNSCC\u201d) on each Business Day, prior to the opening of business on the Exchange (currently 9:30 a.m., Eastern Time), the list of the names and the required number of shares of each Deposit Security to be included in the current Portfolio Deposit (based on information at the end of the previous Business Day) for each Fund. Such Portfolio Securities are applicable, subject to any adjustments as described below, to purchases of Creation Units of a given Fund until such time as the next-announced Deposit Securities composition is made available., 646285=With respect to each Fund the Adviser makes available through the NSCC prior to the opening of business on the Exchange (currently 9:30 a.m., Eastern Time) on each Business Day, the identity and number of shares that will be applicable (subject to possible amendment or correction) to redemption requests received in proper form (as defined below) on that day (\u201cPortfolio Securities\u201d). Portfolio Securities received on redemption may not be identical to Deposit Securities that are applicable to creation of Creation Units. Unless cash redemptions are available or specified for a Fund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit generally consist of Portfolio Securities on the Business Day of the request for redemption, plus cash in an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the shares being redeemed, as next determined after a receipt of a request in proper form, and the value of the Portfolio Securities, less the redemption transaction fee described below. The redemption transaction fee described below is deducted from such redemption proceeds., 453496=REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. To the extent consistent with its investment policies, each Fund may agree to purchase portfolio securities from financial institutions subject to the seller\u2019s agreement to repurchase them at a mutually agreed upon date and price (\u201crepurchase agreements\u201d). Repurchase agreements are considered to be loans under the 1940 Act. Although the securities subject to a repurchase agreement may bear maturities exceeding one year, settlement for the repurchase agreement will never be more than one year after the Fund\u2019s acquisition of the securities and normally will be within a shorter period of time. Securities subject to repurchase agreements normally are held either by the Trust\u2019s custodian or sub-custodian (if any), or in the Federal Reserve/Treasury Book-Entry System. The seller under a repurchase agreement will be required to maintain the value of the securities subject to the agreement in an amount exceeding the repurchase price (including accrued interest). Default by the seller would, however, expose the Fund to possible loss because of adverse market action or delay in connection with the disposition of the underlying obligations. In addition, in the event of a bankruptcy, a Fund could suffer additional losses if a court determines that the Fund\u2019s interest in the collateral is unenforceable., 393233=Time deposits are non-negotiable deposits maintained in banking institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers\u2019 acceptances are time drafts drawn on commercial banks by borrowers, usually in connection with international transactions. Commercial paper represents short-term unsecured promissory notes issued in bearer form by banks or bank holding companies, corporations and finance companies. Certificates of deposit are negotiable certificates issued against funds deposited in a commercial bank for a definite period of time and earning a specified return. Bankers\u2019 acceptances are negotiable drafts or bills of exchange, normally drawn by an importer or exporter to pay for specific merchandise, which are \u201caccepted\u201d by a bank, meaning, in effect, that the bank unconditionally agrees to pay the face value of the instrument on maturity. Fixed time deposits are bank obligations payable at a stated maturity date and bearing interest at a fixed rate. Fixed time deposits may be withdrawn on demand by the investor, but may be subject to early withdrawal penalties that vary depending upon market conditions and the remaining maturity of the obligation. There are no contractual restrictions on the right to transfer a beneficial interest in a fixed time deposit to a third party. Bank notes generally rank junior to deposit liabilities of banks and pari passu with other senior, unsecured obligations of the bank. Bank notes are classified as \u201cother borrowings\u201d on a bank\u2019s balance sheet, while deposit notes and certificates of deposit are classified as deposits. Bank notes are not insured by the FDIC or any other insurer. Congress has temporarily increased FDIC deposit insurance on deposit notes from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor through December 31, 2013., 501285=The Trustees are identified in the table below, which provides information as to their principal business occupations held during the last five years and certain other information. As of March 31, 2012 each of the Trustees oversees 84 Funds (32 of which are operational). Each Trustee serves until his or her death, resignation or removal and replacement. The address for all Trustees and officers is c/o Global X Funds, 399 Park Avenue, 32nd floor, New York, New York 10022. Mr. del Ama is considered an interested Trustee due to his affiliation with the Adviser. The Board believes that having an interested person on the Board helps to bring corporate and financial viewpoints that are critical elements in the Board\u2019s decision-making process., 595625=The Trust is not required to hold annual meetings of shareholders and does not intend to hold such meetings. In the event that a meeting of shareholders is held, each share of the Trust will be entitled, as determined by the Trustees without the vote or consent of shareholders to one vote for each share represented by such shares on all matters presented to shareholders, including the election of Trustees (this method of voting being referred to as \u201cdollar-based voting\u201d). However, to the extent required by the 1940 Act or otherwise determined by the Trustees, series and classes of the Trust will vote separately from each other. Shareholders of the Trust do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of Trustees and, accordingly, the holders of more than 50% of the aggregate voting power of the Trust may elect all of the Trustees, irrespective of the vote of the other shareholders. Meetings of shareholders of the Trust, or any series or class thereof, may be called by the Trustees, the President or Secretary of the Trust or upon the written request of holders of at least a majority of the shares entitled to vote at such meeting. The shareholders of the Trust will have voting rights only with respect to the limited number of matters specified in the Declaration and such other matters as the Trustees may determine or may be required by law., 2757=Registration Statement Under The Investment Company Act Of 1940 \u00fe, 327211=For purposes of the 1940 Act, Shares are issued by a registered investment company and purchases of such Shares by investment companies and companies relying on Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act are subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act, except as permitted by an exemptive order that permits registered investment companies to invest in Shares beyond the limits in Section 12(d)(1)(A), subject to certain terms and conditions, including that the registered investment company and companies relying on Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act enter into an agreement with the Trust regarding the terms of the investment., 497020=BOARD STRUCTURE AND RELATED MATTERS. Board members who are not \u201cinterested persons\u201d of the Funds, as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (\u201cIndependent Trustees\u201d), constitute 75 percent of the Board. Kartik Kiran Shah, an Independent Trustee, serves as Independent Chairman of the Board. The Independent Chairman\u2019s responsibilities include facilitating communication among the Independent Trustees as well as communication between the Independent Trustees and management of the Trust. The Independent Chairman assumes such other duties and performs such activities as he deems necessary or appropriate or which the Board may, from time to time, determine should be handled by the Independent Chairman. The Board considers leadership by an Independent Chairman and the fact that 75 percent of the Board is composed of Independent Trustees to be integral to promoting effective independent oversight of the Funds\u2019 operations and meaningful representation of shareholders\u2019 interests., 82627=The Underlying Index tracks the performance of the highest yielding preferred securities in the United States, as determined by Standard & Poor\u2019s (\u201cIndex Provider\u201d). The Underlying Index is comprised of preferred stocks that meet certain criteria relating to size, liquidity, issuer concentration and rating, maturity and other requirements, as determined by the Index Provider. The Underlying Index does not seek to directly reflect the performance of the companies issuing the preferred stock. As of March 31, 2012, the Underlying Index had 50 constituents. The Fund\u2019s investment objective and Underlying Index may be changed without shareholder approval., 747401=Dividends from net investment income, including any net foreign currency gains, are declared and paid at least annually and any net realized securities gains are distributed at least annually. In order to improve tracking error or comply with the distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, dividends may be declared and paid more frequently than annually for certain Funds. Dividends and securities gains distributions are distributed in U.S. dollars and cannot be automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Funds. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve the status of each Fund as a registered investment company (\u201cRIC\u201d) or to avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income., 663935=To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant\u2019s agreement with the Distributor, in the event the Authorized Participant that has submitted a redemption request in proper form is unable to transfer all or part of the Creation Units to be redeemed to the Trust, at or prior to 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on the Business Day after the date of submission of such redemption request, the Distributor will nonetheless accept the redemption request in reliance on the undertaking by the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing shares as soon as possible. Such undertaking shall be secured by the Authorized Participant\u2019s delivery and maintenance of collateral consisting of cash having a value equal to 110%, which the Adviser may change from time to time, of the value of the missing shares in accordance with the Trust\u2019s then-effective procedures. The only collateral that is acceptable to the Trust is cash in U.S. dollars or an irrevocable letter of credit in form, and drawn on a bank, that is satisfactory to the Trust. The Trust\u2019s current procedures for collateralization of missing shares require, among other things, that any cash collateral shall be held by the Trust\u2019s Custodian, and that the fees of the Custodian and any sub-custodians in respect of the delivery, maintenance and redelivery of the cash collateral shall be payable by the Authorized Participant. The cash collateral posted by the Authorized Participant may be invested at the risk of the Authorized Participant, and income, if any, on invested cash collateral will be paid to that Authorized Participant. The Authorized Participant Agreement permits the Trust to purchase the missing shares or acquire the portfolio securities and the Cash Component underlying such shares at any time and subjects the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the Trust of purchasing such shares, Portfolio Securities or Cash Component and the cash collateral or the amount that may be drawn under any letter of credit., 302371=Cost Basis Reporting. As of January 1, 2012, federal law requires that mutual fund companies report their shareholders' cost basis, gain/loss, and holding period to the Internal Revenue Service on the Fund\u2019s shareholders\u2019 Consolidated Form 1099s when \u201ccovered\u201d securities are sold. Covered securities are any regulated investment company and/or dividend reinvestment plan shares acquired on or after January 1, 2012., 656494=A redemption request is considered to be in \u201cproper form\u201d if (i) an Authorized Participant has transferred or caused to be transferred to the Trust\u2019s Transfer Agent the Creation Unit of shares being redeemed through the book-entry system of DTC so as to be effective by the Exchange closing time on any Business Day and (ii) a request in form satisfactory to the Trust is received by the Distributor from the Authorized Participant on behalf of itself or another redeeming investor within the time periods specified above. If the Transfer Agent does not receive the investor\u2019s shares through DTC\u2019s facilities by 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on the Business Day next following the day that the redemption request is received, the redemption request shall be rejected. Investors should be aware that the deadline for such transfers of shares through the DTC system may be significantly earlier than the close of business on the Exchange. Those making redemption requests should ascertain the deadline applicable to transfers of shares through the DTC system by contacting the operations department of the broker or depositary institution effecting the transfer of the shares., 480115=Any Investment Restriction which involves a maximum percentage (other than the restriction set forth above in Investment Restriction No. 2) will not be considered violated unless an excess over the percentage occurs immediately after, and is caused by, an acquisition or encumbrance of securities or assets of a Fund. The 1940 Act requires that if the asset coverage for borrowings at any time falls below the limits under the 1940 Act described in Investment Restriction No. 2, a Fund will, within three days thereafter (not including Sundays and holidays), reduce the amount of its borrowings to an extent that the net asset coverage of such borrowings shall conform to such limits., 529764=AUDIT COMMITTEE. The purposes of the Audit Committee are to assist the Board of Trustees in (1) its oversight of the Trust\u2019s accounting and financial reporting principles and policies and related controls and procedures maintained by or on behalf of the Trust; (2) its oversight of the Trust\u2019s financial statements and the independent audit thereof; (3) selecting, evaluating and, where deemed appropriate, replacing the independent registered public accounting firm (or nominating the independent registered public accounting firm to be proposed for shareholder approval in any proxy statement); and (4) evaluating the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm. During the fiscal period ended June 30, 2011, the Audit Committee held 4 meetings., 675669=Similarly, beginning in 2011, if a RIC fails this asset-diversification test and the failure is not de minimis, a RIC can cure failure if: (a) the RIC files with the Treasury Department a description of each asset that causes the RIC to fail the diversification tests; (b) the failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect; and (c) the failure is cured within six months (or such other period specified by the Treasury). In such cases, a tax is imposed on the RIC equal to the greater of: (a) $50,000 or (b) an amount determined by multiplying the highest rate of tax (currently 35%) by the amount of net income generated during the period of diversification test failure by the assets that caused the RIC to fail the diversification test., 558414=It is anticipated that the portfolio manager will be responsible for multiple investment accounts, including other investment companies registered under the 1940 Act. As a general matter, certain conflicts of interest may arise in connection with the portfolio manager\u2019s management of a Fund\u2019s investments, on the one hand, and the investments of other accounts for which the portfolio manager is responsible, on the other. For example, it is possible that the various accounts managed could have different investment strategies that, at times, might conflict with one another to the possible detriment of a Fund. Alternatively, to the extent that the same investment opportunities might be desirable for more than one account, possible conflicts could arise in determining how to allocate them. Other potential conflicts might include conflicts created by specific portfolio manager compensation arrangements and conflicts relating to selection of brokers or dealers to execute a Fund\u2019s trades. The Adviser has structured the portfolio manager\u2019s compensation in a manner, and the Funds and the Adviser have adopted policies, procedures and a code of ethics, reasonably designed to safeguard the Funds from being negatively affected as a result of any such conflicts that may arise., 5607=11508 H-236 Providence Road, 527286=Further, the Board regularly receives reports from the Adviser with respect to the Funds\u2019 investments and securities trading and, as necessary, any fair valuation determinations made by the Advisers with respect to certain investments held by the Funds.\u00a0\u00a0As required by law, within two years of the initial approval by the Board of the advisory agreement for each Fund, the Board will be asked to consider the approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement for that Fund. In connection with that process, independent counsel to the Independent Trustees will request on behalf of the Independent Trustees that certain necessary and appropriate information be provided by the Adviser to the Independent Trustees in connection with that consideration and approval process. In addition, the Board members receive reports, presentations and other information from the Adviser regarding each of the Funds. If applicable, in connection with the Board\u2019s consideration of any distribution plan of a Fund under Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act, the Board receives reports from the Adviser and other service providers., 533119=As of December 31, 2011, the officers and Trustees of the Trust, in the aggregate, owned 0% of the Shares of a Fund., 542693=The estimated compensation to be paid to the Independent Trustees for the fiscal year end June 30, 2012 is set forth in the following table:, 262649=Each Fund pays the Adviser a fee (\u201cManagement Fee\u201d) in return for providing investment advisory, supervisory and administrative services under an all-in fee structure. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, the Funds were not operational. The Management Fees are at the following annual rates (stated as a percentage of the average daily net assets of each Fund taken separately):, 531678=CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, NOMINATION AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE. The purposes of the Corporate Governance, Nomination and Compensation Committee are, among other things, to assist the Board of Trustees in (1) its assessment of the adequacy of the Board\u2019s adherence to industry corporate governance best practices; (2) periodic evaluation of the operation of the Trust and meetings with management of the Trust concerning the Trust\u2019s operations and the policies and procedures application to the Fund; (3) review, consideration and recommendation to the full Board regarding Independent Trustee compensation; (4) its identification and evaluation of potential candidates to fill a vacancy on the Board; and (5) selection from among potential candidates of a nominee to be presented to the full Board for its consideration. The Corporate Governance, Nomination and Compensation Committee will not consider shareholders\u2019 nominees. During the fiscal period ended June 30, 2011, the Corporate Governance, Nomination and Compensation Committee held 2 meetings., 429313=The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term \u201ccommodity pool operator\u201d under the Commodity Exchange Act, and, therefore, is not subject to registration or regulation as a pool operator under that Act with respect to the Funds. The Funds will engage in transactions in futures contracts and related options only to the extent such transactions are consistent with the requirement of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cCode\u201d) for maintaining its qualifications as regulated investment companies for federal income tax purposes., 698584=Certain covered call writing activities of the Fund may trigger the U.S. federal income tax straddle rules of Section\u00a01092 of the Internal Revenue Code, requiring that losses be deferred and holding periods be tolled on offsetting positions in options and stocks deemed to constitute substantially similar or related property. Options on single stocks that are not \u201cdeep in the money\u201d may constitute qualified covered calls, which generally are not subject to the straddle rules; the holding period on stock underlying qualified covered calls that are \u201cin the money\u201d although not \u201cdeep in the money\u201d will be suspended during the period that such calls are outstanding. Thus, the straddle rules and the rules governing qualified covered calls could cause gains that would otherwise constitute long-term capital gains to be treated as short-term capital gains, and distributions that would otherwise constitute \u201cqualified dividend income\u201d or qualify for the dividends-received deduction to fail to satisfy the holding period requirements and therefore to be taxed as ordinary income or fail to qualify for the 70% dividends-received deduction, as the case may be., 381011=Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental investment policy in accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in securities of the Fund\u2019s Underlying Index and in Depositary Receipts based on securities in the Underlying Index. Each Fund has also adopted a policy to provide its shareholders with at least 60 days\u2019 prior written notice of any change in such policy. If, subsequent to an investment, the 80% requirement is no longer met, a Fund\u2019s future investments will be made in a manner that will bring the Fund into compliance with this policy., 724161=Rules enacted in March 2010 require the reporting to the IRS of direct and indirect ownership of foreign financial accounts and foreign entities by U.S. persons. Failure to provide this required information can result in a 30% withholding tax on certain payments (\u201cwithholdable payments\u201d) made after December 31, 2012. Specifically, withholdable payments subject to this 30% withholding tax include payments of U.S.-source dividends and interest made on or after January 1, 2014, and payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposal of property that can produce U.S.-source dividends or interest made on or after January 1, 2015., 342576=Investment Company Act File No.: 811-22209, 560834=As of October 31, 2011, Bruno del Ama and Jose Gonzalez were responsible for the management of the following accounts:, 715363=In addition, special tax consequences apply to charitable remainder trusts (\u201cCRTs\u201d) that invest in regulated investment companies that invest directly or indirectly in residual interests in REMICs or equity interests in TMPs. Under legislation enacted in December\u00a02006, a CRT (as defined in section 664 of the Internal Revenue Code) that realizes any UBTI for a taxable year, must pay an excise tax annually of an amount equal to such UBTI. Under IRS guidance issued in October\u00a02006, a CRT will not recognize UBTI solely as a result of investing in the Fund that recognizes \u201cexcess inclusion income.\u201d Rather, if at any time during any taxable year a CRT (or one of certain other tax-exempt shareholders, such as the United States, a state or political subdivision, or an agency or instrumentality thereof, and certain energy cooperatives) is a record holder of a share in the Fund that recognizes \u201cexcess inclusion income,\u201d then the regulated investment company will be subject to a tax on that portion of its \u201cexcess inclusion income\u201d for the taxable year that is allocable to such shareholders, at the highest federal corporate income tax rate. The extent to which this IRS guidance remains applicable in light of the December\u00a02006 legislation is unclear. To the extent permitted under the 1940 Act, the Fund may elect to specially allocate any such tax to the applicable CRT, or other shareholder, and thus reduce such shareholder\u2019s distributions for the year by the amount of the tax that relates to such shareholder\u2019s interest in the Fund. The Fund has not yet determined whether such an election will be made. CRTs and other tax-exempt investors are urged to consult their tax advisers concerning the consequences of investing in the Fund., 581225=Information on how the Funds voted proxies relating to portfolio securities during the most recent 12 month period ended June 30 is available (1) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-888-843-7824 and (2) on the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov., 487467=The Board of Trustees of the Trust has adopted a policy on disclosure of portfolio holdings, which it believes is in the best interest of the Funds\u2019 shareholders. The policy is designed to: (i) protect the confidentiality of the Funds\u2019 non-public portfolio holdings information, (ii) prevent the selective disclosure of such information, and (iii) ensure compliance by Adviser and the Funds with the federal securities laws, including the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder and general principles of fiduciary duty. The Funds\u2019 portfolio holdings, or information derived from the Funds\u2019 portfolio holdings, may, in the Adviser\u2019s discretion, be made available to third parties if such disclosure has been included in the Fund\u2019s public filings with the SEC or is disclosed on the Fund\u2019s publicly accessible Website, ii) such disclosure is determined by the Chief Compliance Officer (\u201cCCO\u201d) to be in the best interests of Fund shareholders and consistent with applicable law; (iii) such disclosure information is made equally available to anyone requesting it; and (iv) the Adviser determines that the disclosure does not present the risk of such information being used to trade against the Funds., 691123=To the extent that the Fund has capital loss carryforwards from prior tax years, those carryforwards will reduce the net capital gains that can support the Fund\u2019s distribution of capital gain dividends. If the Fund uses net capital losses incurred in taxable years beginning on or before December 22, 2010 (pre-2011 losses), those carryforwards will not reduce the Fund\u2019s current earnings and profits, as losses incurred in later years will. As a result, if that Fund then makes distributions of capital gains recognized during the current year in excess of net capital gains (as reduced by carryforwards), the portion of the excess equal to pre-2011 losses factoring into net capital gain will be taxable as an ordinary dividend distribution, even though that distributed excess amount would not have been subject to tax if retained by the Fund. Capital loss carryforwards are reduced to the extent they offset current-year net realized capital gains, whether the Fund retains or distributes such gains. Beginning in 2011, a RIC is permitted to carry forward net capital losses indefinitely and may allow losses to retain their original character (as short or as long-term). For net capital losses recognized prior to such date, such losses are permitted to be carried forward up to 8 years and are characterized as short-term. These capital loss carryforwards may be utilized in future years to offset net realized capital gains of the Fund, if any, prior to distributing such gains to shareholders., 331285=Broker dealers who are not \u201cunderwriters\u201d but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary trading transactions), and thus dealing with Shares that are part of an \u201cunsold allotment\u201d within the meaning of Section 4(3)(C) of the Securities Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(3) of the Securities Act. This is because the prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(3) of the Securities Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. As a result, broker dealer firms should note that dealers who are not underwriters but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted with ordinary secondary market transactions) and thus dealing with the Shares that are part of an overallotment within the meaning of Section 4(3)(A) of the Securities Act would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(3) of the Securities Act. Firms that incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to Shares are reminded that, under Rule 153 of the Securities Act, a prospectus delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the Securities Act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on NYSE Arca is satisfied by the fact that the prospectus is available at NYSE Arca upon request. The prospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is only available with respect to transactions on an exchange., 881601=The dates of the Regular Holidays in calendar year 2013 are:, 337280=1775 I Street, 729617=For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012, certain U.S. shareholders, including individuals and estates and trusts, will be subject to an additional 3.8% Medicare tax on all or a portion of their \u201cnet investment income,\u201d which should include dividends from the Fund and net gains from the disposition of shares of the Fund. U.S. shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the implications of the additional Medicare tax resulting from an investment in the Fund., 292625=Excise Tax Distribution Requirements. Under the Code, a nondeductible excise tax of 4% is imposed on the excess of a RIC\u2019s \u201crequired distribution\u201d for the calendar year ending within the RIC\u2019s taxable year over the \u201cdistributed amount\u201d for such calendar year. The term \u201crequired distribution\u201d means the sum of (a) 98% of ordinary income (generally net investment income) for the calendar year, (b) 98.2% of capital gain (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending on October 31 (or December 31, if such Fund so elects), and (c) the sum of any untaxed, undistributed net investment income and net capital gains of the RIC for prior periods. The term \u201cdistributed amount\u201d generally means the sum of (a) amounts actually distributed by such Fund from its current year\u2019s ordinary income and capital gain net income and (b) any amount on which such Fund pays income tax for the taxable year ending in the calendar year. Although such Fund intends to distribute its net investment income and net capital gains so as to avoid excise tax liability, such Fund may determine that it is in the interest of shareholders to distribute a lesser amount. The Funds intend to declare and pay these amounts in December (or in January which must be treated by you as received in December) to avoid these excise taxes, but can give no assurances that its distributions will be sufficient to eliminate all such taxes., 61164=Risk of Investing in ETFs: The Fund may hold ETFs to gain exposure to certain asset classes. As a result, the Fund is subject to the same risks as the underlying ETFs. While the risks of owning shares of an underlying ETF generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying securities the ETF is designed to track, lack of liquidity in an underlying ETF can result in its value being more volatile than the underlying portfolio securities. An ETF may trade at a premium or discount to its net asset value. The Fund will indirectly bear its pro rata share of the fees and expenses incurred by an ETF it invests in, including advisory fees, and will pay brokerage commissions in connection with the purchase and sale of shares of ETFs. ETFs that invest in commodities may be, or may become, subject to regulatory trading limits that could hurt the value of their securities and could affect the Fund\u2019s ability to pursue its investment program as described in this prospectus. Additionally, some ETFs are not registered under the Investment Company of 1940 Act and therefore, are not subject to the regulatory scheme and investor protections of the Investment Company Act of 1940., 312111=Because foreign markets may be open on different days than the days during which a shareholder may purchase Shares, the value of the Fund\u2019s investments may change on days when shareholders are not able to purchase Shares. Additionally, due to varying holiday schedules redemption requests made on certain dates may result in a settlement period exceeding seven calendar days. A list of the holiday schedules of the foreign exchanges of the Funds\u2019 Underlying Indexes, as well as the dates on which a settlement period would exceed seven calendar days in 2011 is contained in the SAI., 366649=The Trust currently consists of 84 investment portfolios. The Trust was formed as a Delaware Statutory Trust on March 6, 2008 and is authorized to have multiple series or portfolios. The Trust is an open-end management investment company, registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (\u201c1940 Act\u201d). The offering of the Trust\u2019s shares is registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d). This SAI relates only to the following Funds:, 289518=Distributions from a Fund will generally be taxable to you in the year in which they are paid, with one exception. Dividends and distributions declared by a Fund in October, November or December and paid in January of the following year are taxed as though they were paid on December 31., 561753=(As of October 31, 2011), 671997=In addition to satisfaction of the Distribution Requirement, each Fund must derive with respect to a taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from dividends, interest, certain payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities or foreign currencies, or from other income derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities, or currencies or net income derived from an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership. Beginning in 2011, if a RIC fails this 90% source-of-income test it is no longer subject to a 35% penalty as long as such failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. Instead, the amount of the penalty for non-compliance is the amount by which the non-qualifying income exceeds one-ninth of the qualifying gross income., 306458=Each Fund calculates its NAV generally once daily Monday through Friday generally as of the regularly scheduled close of business of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) on each day that the NYSE is open for business, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that any assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar shall be translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more major banks or dealers that make a two-way market in such currencies (or a data service provider based on quotations received from such banks or dealers). The NAV of each Fund is calculated by dividing the value of the net assets of such Fund (i.e., the value of its total assets less total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding Shares, generally rounded to the nearest cent., 346262=The Prospectus for the various Funds is dated April 25, 2012. Capitalized terms used herein that are not defined have the same meaning as in the Prospectus, unless otherwise noted. A copy of the Prospectus may be obtained without charge by writing to SEI Investments Global Fund Services, One Freedom Valley Drive Oaks, PA 19456, calling 1-888-GXFund-1 (1-888-493-8631) or visiting www.globalxfunds.com. The principal U.S. national stock exchange on which all Funds identified in this SAI are listed is NYSE Arca, Inc., 388487=NON-DIVERSIFICATION RISK. Non-diversification risk is the risk that a non-diversified fund may be more susceptible to adverse financial, economic or other developments affecting any single issuer, and more susceptible to greater losses because of these developments. Each Fund is classified as \u201cnon-diversified\u201d for purposes of the 1940 Act. A \u201cnon-diversified\u201d classification means that the Fund is not limited by the 1940 Act with regard to the percentage of its assets that may be invested in the securities of a single issuer. The securities of a particular issuer may dominate the Underlying Index of such a Fund and, consequently, the Fund\u2019s investment portfolio. Each Fund may also concentrate its investments in a particular industry or group of industries, as noted in the description of the Fund. The securities of issuers in particular industries may dominate the Underlying Index of such a Fund and, consequently, the Fund\u2019s investment portfolio. This may adversely affect its performance or subject the Fund\u2019s shares to greater price volatility than that experienced by less concentrated investment companies., 455029=REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. To the extent consistent with its investment policies, each Fund may borrow funds by selling portfolio securities to financial institutions such as banks and broker/dealers and agreeing to repurchase them at a mutually specified date and price (\u201creverse repurchase agreements\u201d). The Funds may use the proceeds of reverse repurchase agreements to purchase other securities either maturing, or under an agreement to resell, on a date simultaneous with or prior to the expiration of the reverse repurchase agreement. Reverse repurchase agreements are considered to be borrowings under the 1940 Act. Reverse repurchase agreements involve the risk that the market value of the securities sold by the Fund may decline below the repurchase price. The Funds will pay interest on amounts obtained pursuant to a reverse repurchase agreement. While reverse repurchase agreements are outstanding, the Funds will segregate liquid assets in an amount at least equal to the market value of the securities, plus accrued interest, subject to the agreement., 286836=Distributions of \u201cqualifying dividends\u201d will also generally be taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates through 2012, as long as certain requirements are met. In general, if 95% or more of the gross income of a Fund (other than net capital gain) consists of dividends received from domestic corporations or \u201cqualified\u201d foreign corporations (\u201cqualifying dividends\u201d), then all distributions paid by a Fund to individual shareholders will be treated as qualifying dividends. But if less than 95% of the gross income of a Fund (other than net capital gain) consists of qualifying dividends, then distributions paid by such Fund to individual shareholders will be qualifying dividends only to the extent they are derived from qualifying dividends earned by such Fund. For the lower rates to apply you must have owned your Shares for at least 61 days during the 121-day period beginning on the date that is 60 days before such Fund\u2019s ex-dividend date (and such Fund will need to have met a similar holding period requirement with respect to the shares of the corporation paying the qualifying dividend). The amount of a Fund\u2019s distributions that qualify for this favorable treatment may be reduced as a result of such Fund\u2019s securities lending activities (if any), a high portfolio turnover rate or investments in debt securities or \u201cnon-qualified\u201d foreign corporations. In addition, whether distributions received from foreign corporations are qualifying dividends will depend on several factors including the country of residence of the corporation making the distribution. Accordingly, distributions from many of the Funds\u2019 holdings may not be qualifying dividends., 485182=For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Unit Aggregations after placing an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent shares, and sells such shares directly to customers, or if it chooses to couple the creation of a supply of new shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the Securities Act must take into account all the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case, and the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as an underwriter. Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not \u201cunderwriters\u201d but are effecting transactions in shares, whether or not participating in the distribution of shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(3) of the Securities Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to shares of the Funds are reminded that, pursuant to Rule 153 under the Securities Act, a prospectus delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the Securities Act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on the Exchange is satisfied by the fact that the prospectus is available at the Exchange upon request. The prospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is only available with respect to transactions on an exchange., 500879=The Board of Trustees met 6 times during the fiscal period ended June 30, 2011. The Board may hold special meetings, as needed, either in person or by telephone, to address matters arising between regular meetings., 1081841=In the calendar year 2013, the dates of regular holidays affecting the following securities markets present the worst-case redemption cycle for a Fund as follows:, 651675=Redemption requests in respect of Creation Units must be submitted to the Distributor by or through an Authorized Participant. Investors other than Authorized Participants are responsible for making arrangements for a redemption request through an Authorized Participant. An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable redemption request no later than the earlier of (i) 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time or (ii) the closing time of the trading session on the relevant Fund\u2019s Exchange, on any Business Day in order to receive that Business Day\u2019s NAV., 221732=ETFs that invest in commodities may be, or may become, subject to regulatory trading limits that could hurt the value of their securities and could affect the Fund\u2019s ability to pursue its investment program as described in this prospectus. Additionally, some ETFs are not registered under the Investment Company of 1940 Act and therefore, are not subject to the regulatory scheme and investor protections of the Investment Company Act of 1940., 490=on April 25, 2012, 481937=CURRENT 1940 ACT LIMITATIONS, 261004=Global X Management Company LLC serves as the Adviser and the administrator for the Fund. Subject to the supervision of the Board of Trustees, the Adviser is responsible for managing the investment activities of the Fund and the Fund\u2019s business affairs and other administrative matters. The Adviser has been an investment adviser since 2008. The Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company with its principal offices located at 399 Park Avenue, 32nd floor, New York, New York 10022.}",
