Occasionally, a tie between two or more teams occurs, requiring a tie-break. All teams involved in the tie breaker are considered Co-Divisional Champions, and the winner of the tie-breaker is the division's representative to the Championship Game. Below is list of all Divisional Champions and Co-Champions:, 136811=1990 - Georgia 1991 - Mississippi State 1992 - LSU 1993 - Mississippi State 1994 - Mississippi State 1995 - LSU 1996 - Georgia 1997 - Georgia 1998 - Georgia 1999 - Georgia 2000 - Georgia 2001 - Tennessee 2002 - Auburn 2003 - Florida 2004 - Ole Miss 2005 - Tennessee 2006 - Ole Miss 2007 - Ole Miss 2008 - Florida 2009 - Tennessee 2010 - Florida 2011 - Kentucky 2012 - Kentucky 2013 - Tennessee 2014 - Florida 2015 - Georgia, 121056=In 1990, a team dual match format was instituted for the conference tournament which provided the SEC Tournament Champion.[6], 138662=In 2000, the SEC changed the determination of its tennis champions to the team with the best winning percentage in conference regular-season dual matches (11 matches). Before this, a points system was used in which full- or half-points were awarded for wins during the season as well as during the conference tournament., 121841=For the 1999 season, the same points system was in place with a couple of changes: one full point for first-round bye in the conference tournament and one full point for a win in any round of the conference tournament.[8], 137778=2002 - Ole Miss (West) 2003 - Ole Miss (West) 2004 - Florida (East) 2005 - Florida (East), Ole Miss (West) 2006 - Ole Miss (West) 2007 - Ole Miss (West) 2008 - Ole Miss (West) 2009 - Georgia (East) 2010 - Ole Miss (West) 2011 - Mississippi State (West) 2012 - Mississippi State (West) 2013 - Texas A&M, Ole Miss (West), 167939=1995 - Alabama (West) 1996 - Arkansas (West) 1997 - Alabama (West) 1998 - Alabama (West) 1999 - Mississippi (West) 2000 - Mississippi (West) 2001 - Mississippi State, Auburn (West) 2002 - Tennessee (East) 2003 - Auburn (West) 2004 - Auburn (West) 2005 - Mississippi (West) 2006 - Auburn (West) 2007 - LSU (West) 2008 - Auburn, LSU (West) 2009 - LSU (West) 2010 - Auburn (West) 2011 - LSU (West) 2012 - Texas A&M (West), 122173=In 2000, the SEC changed the determination of its tennis regular season champion to the team with the best winning percentage in conference regular-season dual matches.[9], 120775=From 1953-1989, the SEC Champion was determined by the accumulation of points in an individual flighted tournament (there was not a separate team tournament champion).[5], 37714=1895 - North Carolina 1896 - Georgia, LSU 1897 - Vanderbilt 1898 - Sewanee 1899 - Sewanee 1900 - Auburn, Clemson 1901 - Vanderbilt 1902 - Clemson, LSU 1903 - Cumberland, Sewanee, Vanderbilt 1904 - Auburn, Vanderbilt 1905 - Vanderbilt 1906 - Vanderbilt 1907 - Vanderbilt 1908 - LSU 1909 - Sewanee 1910 - Auburn, Vanderbilt 1911 - Vanderbilt 1912 - Vanderbilt 1913 - Auburn 1914 - Auburn, Tennessee 1915 - Vanderbilt 1916 - Georgia Tech 1917 - Georgia Tech 1918 - Georgia Tech 1919 - Auburn 1920 - Georgia, Georgia Tech, Tulane 1921 - Centre, Georgia Tech, 103309=1997 - Florida 1998 - Mississippi State 1999 - Arkansas 2000 - LSU 2001 - South Carolina 2002 - Georgia 2003 - LSU 2004 - Georgia 2005 - Georgia 2006 - LSU 2007 - Florida 2008 - Alabama 2009 - Alabama 2010 - LSU 2011 - Georgia 2012 - Florida 2013 - Missouri 2014 - Kentucky 2015 - Tennessee, 57284=When the SEC expanded to 12 schools with the addition of South Carolina and Arkansas for the 1992 season, the conference divided its basketball teams into separate divisions, East and West, just like for football. With the addition of Texas A&M and Missouri for the 2012 season, divisions were eliminated in basketball.[2], 36562=1922 - Georgia Tech, North Carolina, Vanderbilt 1923 - Vanderbilt, Washington & Lee 1924 - Alabama 1925 - Alabama, Tulane 1926 - Alabama 1927 - Georgia Tech, NC State, Tennessee 1928 - Georgia Tech 1929 - Tulane 1930 - Alabama, Tulane 1931 - Tulane 1932 - Auburn, LSU, Tennessee, 150263=2002 - Auburn (West) 2003 - Alabama (West) 2004 - LSU (West) 2005 - Mississippi State, Ole Miss (West) 2006 - Alabama (West) 2007 - LSU, Auburn (West) 2008 - Arkansas (West) 2009 - Arkansas (West) 2010 - Ole Miss (West) 2011 - Alabama (West) 2012 - Alabama (West) 2013 - Florida, Georgia (East), Texas A&M (West), 169182=The SEC Volleyball Tournament was suspended for three seasons after the 2005 season. It was not renewed, but, with the NCAA on the verge of officially adding sand volleyball to its Emerging Sports List, the conference's coaches instead sponsored a Commissioner's Cup tournament for that variation of the sport. The tournaments, which were held in mid-April between 2008\u201310, were won by Georgia, South Carolina, and LSU respectively., 60999=Although the SEC began sponsoring women's basketball competition in the 1979\u201380 season, it was not fully integrated into the conference until the 1982\u201383 season, which was the first in which each team played the same number of conference games. Also, although this article lists both regular-season and tournament champions, the SEC has officially awarded its conference title based solely on the regular-season standings since the 1985\u201386 season. From 1980 to 1985, the official SEC champion was the tournament winner, but the tournament now only determines the recipient of the SEC's automatic berth in the NCAA tournament.[3], 241742=Four SEC schools compete in Women's Equestrian: Auburn, Georgia, South Carolina and Texas A&M. The first conference championship was contested in 2013., 35014=* denotes tie-break winner and subsequent division representative to the SEC Championship Game. \u2020In 1993 Auburn finished first in the West standings but was ineligible due to NCAA probation and postseason ban. \u2021In 2002 Alabama finished first in the West standings but was ineligible due to NCAA probation and postseason ban., 36314=The Southern Conference was an immediate predecessor to the SEC, with all charter SEC schools having been members before leaving to form the SEC after the 1932 season., 179725=1979 - Tennessee 1980 - Tennessee 1981 - Alabama 1982 - LSU 1983 - Tennessee 1984 - Kentucky 1985 - LSU 1986 - Georgia 1987 - Florida 1988 - Tennessee 1989 - Kentucky 1990 - Georgia 1991 - Florida 1992 - LSU 1993 - Georgia 1994 - Georgia 1995 - Arkansas 1996 - Arkansas 1997 - Florida 1998 - Arkansas 1999 - Arkansas 2000 - LSU 2001 - Arkansas 2002 - Arkansas 2003 - Arkansas 2004 - Florida 2005 - Alabama, 180680=1995 - Arkansas (West) 1996 - Arkansas (West) 1997 - Arkansas (West) 1998 - Arkansas (West) 1999 - Arkansas (West) 2000 - Alabama (West) 2001 - Arkansas (West) 2002 - Arkansas (West) 2003 - Arkansas (West) 2004 - Arkansas, Alabama (West) 2005 - LSU, Arkansas (West) 2006 - LSU (West) 2007 - LSU (West) 2008 - LSU (West) 2009 - Kentucky (East) 2010 - LSU (West) 2011 - LSU (West) 2012 - Texas A&M (West), 104099=1997 - LSU (West) 1998 - LSU (West) 1999 - Tennessee, South Carolina (East) 2000 - Kentucky (East) 2001 - South Carolina (East) 2002 - South Carolina (East) 2003 - Alabama (West) 2004 - Tennessee (East) 2005 - Georgia (East) 2006 - Georgia (East) 2007 - LSU (West) 2007 - Alabama (West) 2008 - Alabama (West) 2009 - Alabama (West) 2010 - Florida (East) 2011 - Florida (East) 2012 - Tennessee (East) 2013 - LSU (West), 167076=1993 - Arkansas 1994 - Auburn 1995 - Alabama 1996 - Arkansas 1997 - Vanderbilt 1998 - Vanderbilt 1999 - Mississippi 2000 - Georgia 2001 - Auburn 2002 - Florida 2003 - Florida 2004 - Tennessee 2005 - Auburn 2006 - Florida 2007 - Georgia 2008 - Georgia 2009 - LSU 2010 - South Carolina 2011 - Florida 2012 - Auburn 2013 - Florida 2014 - Kentucky, 121292=From 1990-98, the SEC Champion was determined by a total aggregate points accumulated at the conclusion of the conference tournament: one full point was awarded for each regular-season conference win, one-half point for wins in the first two rounds of the conference tournament, one-half point for receiving a first-round bye in the conference tournament and one full point for a win in the conference tournament semifinals and finals.[7]}",
