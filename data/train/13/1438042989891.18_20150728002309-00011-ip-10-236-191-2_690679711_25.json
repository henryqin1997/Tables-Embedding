The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in contract research costs as a result of the completion in 2013 of our relamorelin Phase\u00a02 clinical trial. For the remainder of 2014, we expect our research and development expenses to remain relatively steady as we complete certain Phase\u00a02 trials, initiate new trials for relamorelin and RM-493, and hire additional personnel in the clinical operations department., 1027654=initiate this clinical trial by the end of 2014, and to conduct this clinical trial in the United States, Canada, and Europe., 1143282=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dr.\u00a0Van der Ploeg has been our Chief Scientific Officer since October 2011. He has more than 25\u00a0years of drug development experience focused on obesity, metabolic disorders, oncology, and neurodegenerative diseases. Before joining Rhythm, he was Senior Vice President of Integrative Medicine and Translational Science at Abraxis Bioscience and Head of R&D at Abraxis Health; both companies were acquired by Celgene Corporation. Prior to that, he held R&D leadership roles at MRL directing drug development programs in metabolism, oncology, and neurodegenerative diseases as Vice President, Basic Research and Site Head, MRL Boston; Site Head, MRL San Diego; and Head, Obesity Research for Merck Rahway and Banyu, Japan. Previously, Dr.\u00a0Van der Ploeg was an associate professor in the Department of Genetics and Development at Columbia University. He has received numerous awards and grants for his research and has published more than 200 peer-reviewed research papers. Dr.\u00a0Van der Ploeg is a named inventor on more than 50 patents and patent applications. He received an M.S. in Biochemistry from the University of Amsterdam and a Ph.D. in Biochemistry/Enzymology/Genetics from the University of Amsterdam/Netherlands Cancer Institute., 794138=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Research and development expense.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Research and development expense increased by $2,337 to $18,015 in 2013 from $15,678 in 2012, an increase of 15%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in external services in 2013 related to the initiation of new Phase\u00a02 clinical trials for both relamorelin and RM-493., 527428=Historical net tangible book value per share as of June\u00a030, 2014, 879285=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Net cash used in investing activities was $5,128 for the year ended December\u00a031, 2013, and consisted primarily of purchases of marketable securities of $28,741 offset by maturities of marketable securities of approximately $23,613., 93992=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1)\u00a0the last day of the fiscal year (a)\u00a0following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b)\u00a0in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0\u00a0billion, or (c)\u00a0in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700\u00a0million as of the prior June\u00a030th, and (2)\u00a0the date on which we have issued more than $1.0\u00a0billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. We refer to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 in this prospectus as the \"JOBS Act,\" and references in this prospectus to \"emerging growth company\" shall have the meaning ascribed to it in the JOBS Act., 524434=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our historical net tangible book value as of June\u00a030, 2014 was approximately $(64.3) million, or $(5.88) per common unit. Our historical net tangible book value is the amount of our total tangible assets less our total liabilities, including the liquidation preference of our convertible preferred units. Net historical tangible book value per common unit is our historical net tangible book value divided by the number of common units outstanding as of June\u00a030, 2014., 229689=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are an early stage company. We were incorporated in November 2008 and commenced active operations in February 2010. Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring rights to intellectual property, business planning, raising capital, developing our technology, identifying potential product candidates, undertaking preclinical studies and, beginning in November 2010, conducting clinical trials. We have not yet demonstrated our ability to successfully complete a pivotal Phase\u00a03 clinical trial, obtain marketing approvals, manufacture at commercial scale, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales, marketing and distribution activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Consequently, any predictions made about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history., 876426=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Net cash used in operating activities was $17,830 for the year ended December\u00a031, 2012, and consisted primarily of a net loss of $18,130 adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and stock-based compensation. The significant items in the change in operating assets and liabilities includes an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $1,459 and an increase of approximately $1,258 in prepaid expenses and other current assets., 882245=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Net cash provided by financing activities was $8,939 for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and consisted of the proceeds from the issuance of 18\u00a0million shares of our series\u00a0B preferred stock., 991392=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Phase 2a clinical trial also demonstrated an improvement in both GI motility and clinical symptoms. The initial biomarker results on GI motility were presented in May 2014 at Digestive Diseases Week 2014, the leading GI scientific meeting. The biomarker data indicates that relamorelin administered once daily for two weeks in patients with chronic constipation resulted in statistically significant acceleration of lower GI motility, supporting utility in the treatment of chronic constipation. This clinical trial also demonstrated improvement in other biomarkers of GI motility, stomach emptying and small bowel motility, confirming relamorelin's pro-motility effect on both upper and lower GI function. In addition, relamorelin improved clinical symptoms of constipation. Specific highlights of the clinical trial include:, 554761=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Effective immediately upon closing of this offering, an aggregate of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0shares of our common stock will be reserved for issuance under our 2014 equity incentive plan. Furthermore, we may choose to raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. To the extent that any new options are issued under our equity incentive plans or we issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or convertible debt securities in the future, there will be further dilution to investors participating in this offering., 362715=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our plan is to expand our internal clinical development operations and capabilities so that we can enroll and manage our Phase\u00a02b and Phase\u00a03 clinical trials, if any, of relamorelin for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis such that, if the clinical trials are successful, we can file\u00a0an NDA in the United States by 2018. Based on initial discussions with the FDA, we anticipate that the pivotal Phase\u00a03 clinical trials required for regulatory approval in the United States of relamorelin for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis will assess efficacy based on 12\u00a0weeks of treatment. However, we have not finalized the design, timing and size of our Phase\u00a03 trials with the FDA and therefore cannot assure you that they will start on time. In addition, obtaining approval of an NDA is a complex, lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and the FDA may delay, limit or deny approval of relamorelin and RM-493 for many reasons, including, among others:, 17864=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Registrant hereby amends this Registration Statement on such date or dates as may be necessary to delay its effective date until the Registrant shall file\u00a0a further amendment which specifically states that this Registration Statement shall thereafter become effective in accordance with Section\u00a08(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or until the Registration Statement shall become effective on such date as the Securities and Exchange Commission, acting pursuant to said Section\u00a08(a), may determine., 31306=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The underwriters expect to deliver the shares to purchasers on or about\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 2014 through the book-entry facilities of The Depository Trust Company., 741376=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In April 2014, our board of directors, based on market conditions and the clinical advancement of our relamorelin and RM-493 clinical programs, authorized the management team to assess the feasibility of an IPO in the second half of 2014. In early May 2014, we selected underwriters and held an organizational meeting. In connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December\u00a031, 2013 and in preparing for this offering, we re-valued, solely for financial reporting purposes, our common units as of March\u00a021, 2013. We also performed additional retrospective valuations of our common stock or common units, as applicable, as of January\u00a030, 2013, June\u00a05, 2013 and September\u00a012, 2013 to coincide with the issuance of certain of the equity grants. Finally, we performed a retrospective valuation of our common units as of December\u00a031, 2013 and a contemporaneous valuation as of March\u00a021, 2014. We believe that the preparation of the retrospective valuations was necessary due to the fact that the timeframe and probability for a potential IPO had accelerated significantly since the time of our initial contemporaneous valuations, and that such acceleration would have a significant impact on the fair value of our common stock. We concluded that retrospective valuations for grant dates prior to January\u00a030, 2013 were not required due to the lack of clarity and risk related to our early stage research programs and determined it would not be reasonable to assign a probability to a future IPO., 658222=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have completed a Phase\u00a02 clinical trial of relamorelin for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis. Based on consultation with regulatory authorities, we expect to initiate a Phase\u00a02b clinical trial for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis by the end of 2014. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, has granted Fast Track designation to relamorelin for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis. Fast Track designation is designed to facilitate and expedite the review of drugs for serious conditions with high unmet need, in order to get drugs to patients earlier. We intend to manage our relamorelin clinical development program such that, if our clinical trials are successful, we can file\u00a0a new drug application, or NDA, by 2018. We are also conducting a Phase\u00a02a clinical trial of relamorelin for the treatment of refractory chronic constipation in Parkinson's disease patients and a Phase\u00a02a benchmark clinical trial of relamorelin in patients with chronic constipation. RM-493 is in clinical development for the treatment of obesity caused by genetic deficiencies in the MC4 pathway. We expect to initiate two Phase\u00a02a clinical trials in patients with genetic deficiencies in the MC4 pathway by the end of 2014, one for the treatment of obesity in patients with a single mutation of the MC4 receptor gene, and one in patients with Prader Willi Syndrome, or PWS., 925205=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We submitted an IND with the FDA for the indication of obesity on October\u00a012, 2011. This IND remains open and has not been subject to any clinical hold., 796146=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following table summarizes our results of operations for the six months ended June\u00a030, 2013 and 2014, together with the changes in those items in dollars and as a percentage:, 536780=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following table summarizes, on a pro forma basis as of June\u00a030, 2014, the total number of shares purchased from us, the total consideration paid, or to be paid, and the average price per share paid, or to be paid, by existing stockholders and by new investors in this offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, before deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. As the table below shows, new investors purchasing shares in this offering will pay an average price per share substantially higher than our existing stockholders paid., 1137745=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dr.\u00a0Gottesdiener has been our Chief Executive Officer and a member of our board of directors since October\u00a02011. He joined Rhythm after 16\u00a0years at Merck Research Laboratories. Dr.\u00a0Gottesdiener joined Merck early clinical development in 1995, helping to transition compounds from the bench to the bedside and through to proof of concept. He held positions of increasing responsibility, eventually leading Merck's early clinical development across all therapeutic areas from 2001 through early 2006. From 2006-2011, he was a leader of Merck's late clinical development organization, first overseeing the development of Merck's infectious diseases and vaccine products through pivotal trials, registration, and life cycle management, including Gardasil\u0099 (HPV Vaccine), Rotateq\u0099 (rotavirus vaccine), Zostavax\u0099 (zoster vaccine) and Isentress\u0099 (HIV integrase inhibitor), among others. In 2008, Dr.\u00a0Gottesdiener was appointed Late Stage Therapeutic Group Leader, and in that role led Merck's late-stage clinical development efforts (from Phase\u00a02 thru patent expiry) across all therapeutic areas. After Merck's merger with Schering Plough in 2009, he continued as co-head of late development. Dr.\u00a0Gottesdiener received his B.A. from Harvard College and his M.D. from the University of Pennsylvania. He completed his residency and fellowship at the Brigham and Women's Hospital-Beth Israel Medical Center-Dana Farber Cancer Institute Children's Hospital programs. After his fellowship, Dr.\u00a0Gottesdiener did postdoctoral research in the laboratory of Dr.\u00a0Jack Strominger at Dana Farber Cancer Institute working on the molecular immunology of the T-cell receptor. In 1986, he joined the faculty as an assistant professor at Columbia University, started an independent research laboratory with NIH RO-1 funding, focusing on gene transcription, and was Associate Clinical Professor of Medicine at the time he left to join Merck in 1995. We believe that Dr.\u00a0Gottesdiener's detailed knowledge of our company, his extensive experience in the pharmaceutical industry as a senior executive, and his research work for both medical and academic institutions provide him with the qualifications to serve as chairman of our board of directors., 532092=Pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share at June\u00a030, 2014 after giving effect to the offering, 664968=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rhythm Holding Company, LLC, or the LLC entity, was formed on March\u00a021, 2013 as a holding company in connection with a corporate restructuring, or the Prior Restructuring, by Rhythm Pharmaceuticals,\u00a0Inc., a Delaware corporation that was organized in November 2008. Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. changed its name to Rhythm Health,\u00a0Inc., or Rhythm Health, on July\u00a07, 2014. Rhythm Health and Rhythm Metabolic,\u00a0Inc., or Rhythm Metabolic, a Delaware corporation organized on March\u00a021, 2013, became the wholly owned subsidiaries of the LLC entity as a result of certain exchange of equity transactions in connection with the Prior Restructuring. Pursuant to the Prior Restructuring, each outstanding share of series\u00a0A preferred stock, series\u00a0B preferred stock and common stock of Rhythm Health was exchanged for one series\u00a0A preferred unit, series\u00a0B preferred unit and common unit, respectively of the LLC entity. Each outstanding warrant to purchase common stock of Rhythm Health was converted into a warrant to purchase an equivalent number of common units of the LLC entity. In addition, each outstanding stock option to purchase a share of common stock of Rhythm Health was cancelled and the LLC entity issued to the holder of such cancelled stock option one common unit of the LLC entity. If such outstanding stock option was subject to vesting at the effective time of its cancellation, then such common unit was issued by the LLC entity subject to continued vesting to the same extent as such outstanding stock option was still subject to vesting at the effective time of its cancellation. See \"The Prior Restructuring\" for additional information., 727817=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of common units for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2014 using the Probability Weighted Expected Return Method, or the PWERM, were as follows: volatility of 59.0%, risk-free interest rate of 0.45% and 2.0\u00a0years to liquidity event., 746497=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December\u00a031, 2012 and 2013, together with the changes in those items in dollars and as a percentage:, 908991=marketable securities are accounted for as available-for-sale securities and consisted of investments in U.S. government sponsored enterprise securities. As these securities were available to fund current operations, they are classified as current assets. Marketable securities are stated at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included, until realized, as a component of other comprehensive income, which is a separate component of stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses are determined on the specific-identification method and are included in investment income. There were nominal realized gains for the years ended December\u00a031, 2012 and 2013, respectively. Other-than-temporary impairments of investments are recognized in the statements of operations if we have the intent to sell the security, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis. Even if we do not expect to sell a security, we evaluate expected cash flows to be received to determine if a credit loss has occurred. In the event of a credit loss, only the amount associated with the credit loss is recognized in the statements of operations. The amount of loss relating to other factors is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). There have been no impairment losses recognized in any period presented. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly because our investments are in short-term marketable securities. Our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if market interest rates increase. A hypothetical change of 1% in U.S. interest rates would not be material to the carrying value of our investments., 1063905=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On March\u00a021, 2013, we completed the Prior Restructuring pursuant to which, among other things, we amended the existing license with Ipsen so that the rights licensed by us from Ipsen with respect to each of our ghrelin program and our MC4 program would be held separately by each of our two wholly owned subsidiaries. Rhythm Health holds the rights related to the ghrelin program, including the rights to develop and commercialize relamorelin, and Rhythm Metabolic holds the rights to the MC4 program, including the rights to develop and commercialize RM-493., 1085712=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The agreement related to relamorelin will continue, unless earlier terminated pursuant to its terms, until the later of (i)\u00a0six years from the July\u00a02, 2010 effective date, or (ii)\u00a0the completion of all services under all work plans executed in accordance with the terms of the agreement prior to the sixth anniversary of its effective date. The agreement related to RM-493 will continue, unless earlier terminated pursuant to its terms, until the later of (i)\u00a0six years from the July\u00a017, 2013 effective date, or (ii)\u00a0the completion of all services under all work plans executed in accordance with the terms of the agreement prior to the sixth anniversary of its effective date. Each agreement may be extended by us continuously for additional two-year periods upon written notice to Peptisyntha. We also may terminate each of the agreements or any work order thereunder upon at least 30\u00a0days' prior written notice to Peptisyntha., 1066217=applicable licensed product in the applicable country. In connection with the original license agreement between Ipsen and Rhythm Health, in March 2010, and after giving pro forma effect to the Prior Restructuring and the Conversion, an affiliate of Ipsen acquired 410,000 shares of our common stock and two warrants exercisable for a total of 9,790,000 shares of our common stock, which warrants expire upon consummation of this offering. The term of each Ipsen license agreement continues until the expiration of the applicable royalty term on a country-by-country and product-by- product basis. Upon expiration of the term of each agreement, the licensed rights granted to us under that agreement, to the extent they remain in effect at the time of expiration, will thereafter become irrevocable, perpetual and fully paid-up licenses that survive the expiration of the term. We have a right to terminate each license agreement at any time during the term for any reason on 180\u00a0days' written notice to Ipsen. Ipsen has a right to terminate each agreement prior to expiration of their respective terms for our material breach of the agreement, our failure to initiate or complete development of a licensed product or our bringing an action seeking to have an Ipsen license patent right declared invalid. Upon any early termination of each license agreement not due to Ipsen's material breach, all licensed rights granted under the terminated license agreement will terminate., 986382=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have extensively profiled relamorelin in preclinical studies, which demonstrated strong potency for accelerating stomach emptying when compared to naturally occurring ghrelin and first generation ghrelin agonists. For example, relamorelin was more than 1000-fold more potent in restoring gastric emptying in a rodent model of delayed gastric emptying when compared directly to TZP-102, a small molecule ghrelin agonist developed by Tranzyme for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis. In addition, we have shown in preclinical models that relamorelin has strong anti-inflammatory effects. We completed one and three month toxicology studies, with doses and exposures between 100-760 fold greater than the Phase\u00a02 clinical trial doses and exposures, without evidence of clinically relevant toxicological findings. We plan to initiate carcogenicity studies, one of which is expected to be two years in length., 350142=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval for relamorelin or RM-493, one or more of the U.S. patents we license may be eligible for limited patent term restoration under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term restoration of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, we may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration or the term of any such extension is less than we request, our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our ability to generate revenues could be materially adversely affected., 746359=Comparison of years ended December\u00a031, 2012 and 2013, 994633=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In our MOVE-PD Study, we are assessing the effect of relamorelin, administered by subcutaneous injection at a dose of 100 mcg once daily for two weeks, on the symptoms of constipation. We are conducting the MOVE-PD Study in partnership with the Parkinson's Study Group, one of the largest academic Parkinson's disease clinical consortia. This clinical trial is supported with a $1.35\u00a0million grant from the Michael J. Fox Foundation, which we believe underscores the priority within the Parkinson's disease community concerning better treatments for these GI complications. In consideration for the grant, we must endeavor to complete the study according to a mutually agreed timeline as well as submit certain required communications and deliverables. Failure to perform these obligations may result in the suspension or termination of payments under the grant. In the event that relamorelin generates commercial sales in the indication of chronic constipation in Parkinson's disease above a certain threshold, we are obligated to pay a limited royalty to the Michael J. Fox Foundation up to the amount of the grant. We anticipate that enrollment will be complete, and data will be available for the MOVE-PD study, in the second half of 2015., 398865=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If we expand our operations outside of the United States, we must dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or the FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of such third party in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the company, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations., 795049=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Interest income.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The increase in interest income was nominal and primarily related to an increase in investment balances during the twelve-month period ended December\u00a031, 2013 versus the investments on hand during the twelve-month period ended December\u00a031, 2012., 525026=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our pro forma net tangible book value as of June\u00a030, 2014 after giving effect to the Conversion was $8.3\u00a0million, or $0.05 per share of common stock., 25257=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, and therefore have elected to comply with certain reduced public company reporting requirements., 89132=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rhythm Holding Company, LLC, or the LLC entity, was formed on March\u00a021, 2013 as a holding company in connection with a corporate restructuring, or the Prior Restructuring, by Rhythm Pharmaceuticals,\u00a0Inc., a Delaware corporation that was organized in November 2008. Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. changed its name to Rhythm Health,\u00a0Inc., or Rhythm Health, on July\u00a07, 2014. Rhythm Health and Rhythm Metabolic,\u00a0Inc., or Rhythm Metabolic, a Delaware corporation organized on March\u00a021, 2013, became the wholly owned subsidiaries of the LLC entity as a result of certain exchange of equity transactions in connection with the Prior Restructuring. As part of the Prior Restructuring, Rhythm Health contributed all of its patent rights and other intellectual property rights with respect to RM-493 and Rhythm Health's related MC4 program to Rhythm Metabolic. As a result of the Prior Restructuring, our two product candidates and their related programs have been separated and each is held by a different legal entity, and the LLC entity became the holding company of both of these legal entities. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Rhythm Health, holds all of our patent rights and other intellectual property rights with respect to relamorelin and our related ghrelin agonist program, and our wholly owned subsidiary, Rhythm Metabolic, holds all of our patent rights and other intellectual property rights with respect to RM-493 and our related MC4 agonist program.

Since 2009, Mr.\u00a0de\u00a0la\u00a0Tour has served as Chairman and Director of Ipsen Ltd. and Ipsen Biopharm Ltd. and since 2011 he has served as Vice President in charge of Ipsen Corporate Alliance Management (Ipsen Biopharm\u00a0Ltd). Mr.\u00a0de la Tour is a founding member and served as Vice President of Ipsen's Corporate Business Development department, which he led from 1998 to 2009.

Mr.\u00a0de\u00a0la Tour holds a degree from Institut Superieur de Gestion business school in Paris. We believe that Mr.\u00a0de\u00a0la\u00a0Tour's extensive experience in the pharmaceutical industry as a senior executive at Ipsen provides him with the qualifications to serve as a director of our company., 845355=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Interest income.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The decrease in interest income was nominal and is primarily attributable to a decrease in our investments outstanding for the six months ended June\u00a030, 2014 compared to the six-month period ended June\u00a030, 2013., 998959=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are preparing to initiate two Phase\u00a02a clinical trials by the end of 2014, each for the treatment of obesity caused by a specific genetic deficiency in the MC4 pathway. The first clinical trial is a personalized medicine approach for treating obesity in people with a mutation of the MC4 receptor gene to assess weight loss and safety. We have completed a Phase\u00a01b proof-of-concept clinical trial of RM-493 in this patient population that demonstrated weight loss with four-week treatment. Our second RM-493 Phase\u00a02a clinical trial is in PWS patients; recent scientific evidence supports a role for genetic defects in the MC4 pathway in PWS., 247909=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Changes in regulatory requirements, FDA guidance or unanticipated events during our clinical trials may force us to amend clinical trial protocols or the FDA may impose additional clinical trial requirements. For instance, the FDA issued draft guidance on developing products for weight management in February 2007, but this guidance may be revised in the near future. In March 2012, the FDA's Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee met to discuss possible changes to how the FDA evaluates the cardiovascular safety of weight-management drugs, and the FDA may require additional studies to support registration. In addition, the FDA is considering broader applicability of requirements for cardiovascular outcomes trials, or CVOTs, that exclude some degree of risk of cardiovascular risk pre-approval, including for obesity products. The FDA has also stated it is developing a guidance document for the development of products to treat gastroparesis. Any of these activities could result in additional clinical requirements for relamorelin or RM-493, increases in our costs, or delay of approval of relamorelin or RM-493., 71905=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RM-493 is a potent, first-in-class, Phase\u00a02 ready MC4 agonist, which modulates a key pathway in humans that regulates energy homeostasis and food intake. MC4's critical role in weight regulation was validated with the discovery that a heterozygous mutation of the MC4 receptor gene, a mutation in just one of the two copies of the MC4 receptor gene, results in early onset obesity and severe obesity. We expect to initiate two Phase\u00a02a clinical trials in patients with genetic deficiencies in the MC4 pathway by the end of 2014, one for the treatment of obesity in patients with a single mutation of the MC4 receptor gene, and one in patients with Prader Willi Syndrome, or PWS., 911167=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section\u00a0107 of the JOBS Act provides that an \"emerging growth company,\" or EGC, can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section\u00a07(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an EGC can delay the adoption of certain newly implemented accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies., 939095=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Idiopathic gastroparesis afflicts a comparable number of non-diabetics who have the same symptoms of vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, early satiety and bloating, along with delayed stomach emptying. Idiopathic gastroparesis, or gastroparesis without a specific cause such as diabetes, can be a manifestation of many systemic illnesses, neuromuscular dysfunction, a complication of select surgical procedures, or due to unknown causes. In a 1998 study, 29% of gastroparesis cases were associated with diabetes, 13% developed as a complication of surgery and 36% were due to unknown causes. According to the American Motility Society Task Force on Gastroparesis, 4% of the United States population experiences symptomatic manifestations of gastroparesis., 439316=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, as of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 2014, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0shares of common stock that are reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules, the lock-up agreements and Rule\u00a0144 and Rule\u00a0701 under the Securities Act.

We believe that Mr.\u00a0Exter's extensive experience in the life sciences industry as a venture capitalist and senior executive, as well as his service on the boards of directors of numerous companies provide him with the qualifications to serve as a director of our company., 443270=public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section\u00a0404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or Section\u00a0404, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If we choose not to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section\u00a0404, our auditors will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As a result, investors may become less comfortable with the effectiveness of our internal controls and the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal controls go undetected or may increase. If we choose to provide reduced disclosures in our periodic reports and proxy statements while we are an emerging growth company, investors would have access to less information and analysis about our executive compensation, which may make it difficult for investors to evaluate our executive compensation practices. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \"emerging growth company.\" We will remain an \"emerging growth company\" until the earlier of (1)\u00a0the last day of the fiscal year (a)\u00a0following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b)\u00a0in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0\u00a0billion, or (c)\u00a0in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700\u00a0million as of the prior June\u00a030th, and (2)\u00a0the date on which we have issued more than $1.0\u00a0billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period., 745510=Contemporaneous valuation of common units as of March\u00a031, 2014, 966954=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We expect to initiate our Phase\u00a02b clinical trial of relamorelin by the end of 2014, and we expect it will include approximately 200-400 moderate to severe diabetic gastroparesis patients receiving 12\u00a0weeks of treatment. Based on initial discussions with the FDA, we anticipate that the pivotal Phase\u00a03 clinical trials required for regulatory approval in the United States of relamorelin for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis will assess three months of treatment. We expect that for both our Phase\u00a02b clinical trial and our Phase\u00a03 clinical trial, key endpoints will be improvement in diabetic gastroparesis symptoms as assessed with a PRO. We intend to also measure stomach emptying as a supportive endpoint. Our plan is to manage our relamorelin clinical development program such that, if our clinical trials and chronic toxicology and carcogenicity studies are successful, we anticipate filing an NDA by\u00a02018., 1073558=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the patent family directed to the composition of matter for RM-493, we have one issued U.S. patent and 16 issued non-U.S. patents, including Australia, Canada, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Russia and Singapore. The standard 20-year term for patents in this family would expire in 2026, but the U.S. patent will expire in 2027 due to a patent term adjustment. Patent term extensions for delays in marketing approval may also extend the terms of patents in this family., 216595=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are a development stage company with a limited operating history on which to base your investment decision. Biopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We were incorporated in November 2008. Our operations to date have been limited primarily to organizing and staffing our company and conducting research and development activities for our lead product candidate, relamorelin, and our second product candidate, RM-493. We have never generated any revenue from product sales. We have not obtained regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates., 1075469=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we do not know whether any of the product candidates we in-license will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction, and furthermore, we cannot determine whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection to protect us from competitors, or will be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18\u00a0months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. This potential issue is exacerbated by the fact that, prior to March\u00a016, 2013, in the United States, the first to make the claimed invention may be entitled to the patent. On March\u00a016, 2013, the United States transitioned to a \"first to file\" system in which the first inventor to file\u00a0a patent application may be entitled to the patent. Therefore, we may have to participate in interference, 35836=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 2014, 1042195=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In collaboration with Charite Medical University (Berlin, Germany), we are conducting a Phase\u00a02a proof of concept clinical trial in patients who have homozygous pro-opiomelanocortin, or POMC, deficiency. The very rare phenotype of POMC deficient patients consists of severe early-onset obesity and other hormonal pathology. The obesity develops due to the lack of the Melanocyte-Stimulating-Hormone, or MSH, the hormone that normally activates the MC-4 receptor in the MC4\u00a0pathway. This lack of MSH leads to an improper regulation of energy expenditure and satiety. In this open label Phase\u00a02a proof of concept clinical trial, up to ten POMC deficient patients will receive open label doses of RM-493 by subcutaneous injection once daily for up to 12\u00a0weeks. This clinical trial is expected to initiate in the fall of 2014, with preliminary results available in the first half of 2015. This clinical trial may provide proof of concept for PWS, where a defect in the POMC neurons is also hypothesized., 225090=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As of June\u00a030, 2014, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $9.3\u00a0million. We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0million, assuming an initial public offering price of $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0per share, the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. We expect that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses through at least the first half of 2016. However, our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or a combination of these approaches. We will also require additional capital to obtain regulatory approval for, and to, 877617=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Net cash used in operating activities was $9,496 for the six-month period ended June\u00a030, 2013, and consisted primarily of a net loss of $10,821 adjusted for non-cash items including depreciation and stock-based compensation. The significant items in the change in operating assets and liabilities includes a decrease in accounts payable, accrued and other current liabilities expenses of $471 and a decrease of approximately $677 in prepaid expenses and other current assets., 217336=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since our inception, we have focused substantially all of our efforts and financial resources on research and development of relamorelin and RM-493, which are currently in Phase\u00a02 clinical development. We have funded our operations to date primarily through proceeds from sales of preferred stock and have incurred losses in each year since our inception. Our comprehensive losses were $12.3\u00a0million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2011, $18.1\u00a0million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2012 and $21.4\u00a0million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2013. As of June\u00a030, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $65.4\u00a0million. Substantially all of our operating losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our development program and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to incur increasing levels of operating losses over the next several years and for the foreseeable future. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders' deficit and working capital. We expect our research and development expenses to significantly increase in connection with our additional clinical trials of relamorelin and RM-493 and development of any other product candidates we may choose to pursue. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for relamorelin and/or RM-493, we will incur significant sales, marketing and outsourced manufacturing expenses. Once we are a public company, we will incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all.

In the multiple ascending dose clinical trial conducted in 40 healthy volunteers, 32 of whom received relamorelin, multiple doses from 10 to 300 mcg per day were studied. In that study, relamorelin reduced the time of stomach emptying by 35-50%. To confirm the positive effects of relamorelin on stomach emptying, we conducted a two-part, Phase\u00a01b, single dose crossover clinical trial in 20 type\u00a01 and type\u00a02 diabetic patients suffering from diabetic gastroparesis. In that clinical trial, a single dose 100\u00a0mcg of relamorelin substantially improved stomach emptying, accelerating stomach emptying by 54% in type\u00a01 diabetics and 66% in type\u00a02 diabetics versus placebo (p=ns and p=0.011, respectively).

The annual cost of these GI disorders in 2004, not including digestive cancers and viral diseases, was estimated to be greater than $114.0\u00a0billion in direct and indirect expenditures, including hospital, physician and nursing services as well as over-the-counter and prescription drugs. In 2008, Research and Markets in Business Insights estimated worldwide sales of GI drugs to be worth $49.9\u00a0billion, with approximately 38% of this market represented by sales in the United States totaling $18.8\u00a0billion.

Orlistat is marketed in the United States by Roche Holdings AG under the brand name Xenical and is generally prescribed for short-term use. Orlistat is associated with GI side effects, the nature of which can be socially constraining. These include flatulence and fecal incontinence and urgency. Orlistat was also launched in 2007 by GlaxoSmithKline\u00a0plc in over-the-counter form at half the prescribed dose under the brand name all\u00ed. Phentermine is also generally prescribed for short-term use. Phentermine is a Schedule\u00a0IV controlled substance and, according to the FDA-approved product information, has an amphetamine-like profile, an increased risk for abuse potential, and may be associated with adverse cardiovascular or central nervous system effects. Vivus,\u00a0Inc. commercially launched its combination phentermine/topiramate product in the United States under the name Qsymia in September 2012. Qsymia treatment has resulted in approximately 7% placebo-subtracted weight loss over a period of one year. In June 2012, Arena Pharmaceuticals,\u00a0Inc., or Arena, obtained FDA approval for its product, lorcaserin, which was launched in the United States in June 2013 under the name Belviq. Belviq treatment has demonstrated only modest weight loss. Both Qsymia and Belviq have an increased risk for abuse potential and, therefore, both are designated as Schedule\u00a0IV controlled substances.

Other parties may allege that relamorelin or RM-493 or the use of our technologies infringes patent claims or other intellectual property rights held by them or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. For example, we received a letter in early 2013 from a third party bringing to our attention several patents and patent applications, both U.S. and non-U.S. We believe that these third-party patents do not impact our ability to operate without infringing same, but cannot assure you that the holder of these third-party patents will not attempt to assert these patents against us., 528324=Pro forma net tangible book value per share as of June\u00a030, 2014, 846963=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December\u00a031, 2012 and 2013, and the six months ended June\u00a030, 2013 and 2014:, 1030335=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We plan to initiate a Phase\u00a02a, proof-of-concept, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial in approximately 36 PWS patients for up to eight weeks of active treatment administered once daily by subcutaneous injection, to assess the effects of RM-493 on weight reduction, and PWS-specific hyperphagia-related behaviors, as well as determine its safety profile. Based on the data from this Phase\u00a02a clinical trial, we believe we may proceed into a Phase\u00a03 clinical trial that could lead to an indication for the treatment of PWS patients.

The European Medicines Agency is even more stringent, and recommends metoclopramide for use of no more than five days, and not for chronic conditions such as gastroparesis., 996728=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Early biomarker data from our Phase\u00a01 multiple ascending dose clinical trial of relamorelin in healthy volunteers also support the effects of relamorelin on lower GI motility. In this clinical trial, patients swallowed an ingestible wireless medical sensor, which allowed us to measure the time for the sensor to pass through the digestive tract. In this Phase\u00a01 clinical trial, our exploratory analysis showed a strong trend that relamorelin reduced colonic motility time by up to 54%\u0097from approximately 42\u00a0hours in placebo subjects to approximately 18\u00a0hours in those receiving relamorelin. This was achieved with little, if any, evidence of associated symptoms, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain or abdominal cramping.

The standard 20-year term for patents in this family would expire in 2023, but the U.S. patents will expire in 2024 and 2025 due to patent term adjustments. Patent term extensions for delays in marketing approval may also extend the terms of patents in this family.

Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. changed its name to Rhythm Health,\u00a0Inc., or Rhythm Health, on July\u00a07, 2014. Rhythm Health and Rhythm Metabolic,\u00a0Inc., or Rhythm Metabolic, a Delaware corporation organized on March\u00a021, 2013, became the wholly owned subsidiaries of the LLC entity as a result of the exchange of equity transactions described further below in connection with the Prior Restructuring. As part of the Prior Restructuring, Rhythm Health contributed all of its patent rights and other intellectual property rights with respect to RM-493 and Rhythm Health's related MC4 program to Rhythm Metabolic. As a result of the Prior Restructuring, our two product candidates and their related programs were separated and each is held by a different legal entity, and the LLC entity became the holding company for both of these legal entities. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Rhythm Health, holds all of our patent rights and other intellectual property rights with respect to relamorelin and our related ghrelin agonist program, and our wholly owned subsidiary, Rhythm Metabolic, holds all of our patent rights and other intellectual property rights with respect to RM-493 and our related MC4 agonist program., 5766=855 Boylston Street 11th Floor Boston, MA 02116 (857)\u00a0264-4280 (Address, including zip code, and telephone number, including area code, of Registrant's principal executive offices), 878937=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Net cash used in investing activities was $5,270 for the year ended December\u00a031, 2012, and consisted primarily of purchases of marketable securities of $8,799 offset by maturities of marketable securities of approximately $3,529., 445931=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a public company, and particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Global Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, which in turn could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors., 712252=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As of December\u00a031, 2013, we had net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards to reduce federal and state incomes taxes of approximately $36.0 million and $11.0 million, respectively.

To manage our anticipated development and expansion, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from their day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these development activities. Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. This may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, and give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of relamorelin and RM-493. If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected development and expansion, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or increase our revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize relamorelin and RM-493, if approved, and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage the future development and expansion of our company., 908049=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates.

We recognize stock-based compensation expense related to stock options granted by Rhythm Health before the Prior Restructuring and to any restricted common units granted by the LLC entity from and after the Prior Restructuring to employees and consultants for compensatory purposes, based on the estimated fair value of each stock option or restricted common unit on the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures.

RM-493 may restore MC4 function by increasing activity in the one normal copy of the MC4 gene (see figure below). A 2005 epidemiological study performed in Europe reported a prevalence of 1-2% of genetic defects in the MC4 gene in the obese population with a body mass index, or BMI, of greater than 30 kg/m2, and studies performed in both Europe and the United States, in 2000 and 2003, respectively, reported a prevalence of up to 4% of these genetic defects in more severely obese populations with a BMI of greater than 35 kg/m2. These prevalence rates suggest that there are approximately one million people in the United States with obesity caused by a mutation of the MC4 gene. These patients have a higher risk than the general population for early onset obesity and severe obesity and their complications such as diabetes.

The FDA or other regulatory authorities may also require that we conduct additional pivotal trials. Pursuant to the FDA's February 2007 draft guidance on the development of weight management drugs, in order to reasonably estimate the safety of a weight-management drug, Phase\u00a03 clinical trials must randomize approximately 3,000 subjects to active doses of the product and 1,500 subjects to placebo for one year of treatment. Our focus is not to develop RM-493 for the general category of weight management drugs, but we expect to seek an indication for obesity caused by genetic deficiencies in the MC4 pathway. If RM-493 produces significant treatment effects in these patients, coupled with an acceptable safety profile, our overall clinical program may be less time consuming and require fewer patients than a program for a broader obesity indication. The FDA has advised us, however, that such a program would require development of a systematic and clearly defined approach to classifying patients' various mutations and selecting patients with mutations of unquestionable clinical relevance. In addition we would be required to demonstrate the predictive utility of MC4 genotype related to RM-493-induced weight loss. For example, we may need to show that RM-493 works better in the heterozygote than the wild-type, or genetically normal, population. Alternatively, we may need to demonstrate that RM-493 provides effective treatment for patients who fail to achieve weight loss on an already approved anti-obesity medication in the heterozygous population but not in the general population, thereby showing an advantage to the administration of RM-493 as well as identifying a population of MC4 heterozygotes. Either of these scenarios would require that we study both our intended patient population as well as the general obesity population and could prove costly and time consuming. In addition, the FDA may not agree with our plans, may not support the size and length of our proposed clinical development program, and may not allow us to gain an indication for these genetic causes of obesity. In addition, the FDA may impose additional requirements beyond the February 2007 draft guidance in order to support approval. For example, the FDA has required other sponsors to conduct large CVOTs to rule out excess cardiovascular risk. Overall, it is not yet possible to determine the size, duration, endpoints, and definition of success for our approach. We have not yet commenced any of these clinical trials., 1146054=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr.\u00a0Foley has served as a member of our board of directors since July 2014.
