Tips for prospective students Utilize the faculty staff members office hours. Have lots of fun, it's a small college so everyone knows everyone. Bang for the buck If you are looking for what your money is worth, this is not the right school. Did enjoy being here My friends went here, but otherwise it lacked a challenge as far as the academics go. I did enjoy the small classrooms and how everyone is friendly. Did learn a lot I learnt a lot from the faculty that taught here, mainly on the politics on how the school is run. Login to rate or flag the reviews",
