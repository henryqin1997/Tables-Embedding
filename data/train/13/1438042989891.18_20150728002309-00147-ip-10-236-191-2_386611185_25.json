I tried the below link for a paper template to find screen and hole placement. I tested the ipod mini, UPDATE:\u00a0 Im adding the official apple.com measurements for the various ipods, for you crafter gifters. (see pic below)\u00a0 I \u0091lined\u0092 it with felt for some protection, and there is plastic protecting the screen and the wheel.\u00a0 I found it tricky, actually, cause its so small and theres so much to sew.\u00a0 I\u0092m pleased, the only thing that bugs me is the way the fabric at the top of the screen gets pulled up by the elastic fastener on the back.\u00a0 Also, i embroidered around the edge afterwards, cause i didnt like the raw edge.\u00a0 I think my next one will have one of those little attaches-to-the-strap-of-your-purse straps incorporated into it.\u00a0 So, the other day I finally got around to making a case for my baby \u0096 er \u0096 ipod mini. Hey everyone on: August 10, 2005 09:54:10 PM \u00a0TUTORIAL: My First Ipod Mini Case >> with windows! in Purses,",
    "textAfterTable": "I just thought id point out that the measurements here dont translate directly to the measurements of this project, since this case doesnt have 'sides' that correspond to the thickness of the ipod;\u00a0 just one flat front piece whose edges half-wrap around the sides of the ipod...\u00a0 so you need to add a bit to the front ipod measurements to get the size of the fabric pieces for this project. PLUS you need to adjust for the thickness of the fabric...\u00a0 I added 1cm to the width measurment on each side of my ipod mini to get the width measurement of my case. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 TUTORIAL.... I reccomend reading the whole thing before beginning project. Difficulty level:\u00a0 Easy \u0096 Moderate. I know the tutorial is long, but the process isn\u0092t that long, I\u0092m just a *detail oriented* person! And, when I did this, it only occurred to me to take pics halfway thru, so some pics are missing for early steps \u0096 ample description will help, hopefully. MATERIALS: -a piece of felt -a small piece of fabric,",
