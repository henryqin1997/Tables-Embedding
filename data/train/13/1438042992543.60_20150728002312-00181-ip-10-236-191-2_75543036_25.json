This is new behavior for the 10g release; previous versions supported GMT values of time components. Time components were only converted to the time zone specified by Timestamp when they were stored in the database. For example, the following Timestamp() call constructs a Timestamp value 13-Nov 2003 17:24:30.0 in timezone +5:30., 967=The behavior of this call in previous releases would interpret the timestamp components as GMT, resulting in a timestamp value of 13-Nov 2003 11:54:30.0 in timezone +5:30.
