    "textBeforeTable": "Subbed in by Blake Carter (aka DJ Wolverine). December 16, 2012 Show Shows Pillow Talk is a freeform show that currently airs on Sunday mornings from 7-9. The music it self is, I feel, as it should be: varied, but consistently good. Its hard to pin down the exact sound. Most every week the show is somewhat themed. I like to play dance/electronic music and pop a lot to lighten the mood and wake people up. I play a decent amount of soul music too which often fades into rap (of which is much of the time jazz based rap). I also love to play some 'world' music, which, for me, often ends up being bossa nova or reggae in nature. I just try to make each show flow pretty seamlessly between genres and pick and choose the best unknowns I know from each category to give people the best of each kind of genre. Next show: August 3, 2015 Sundays at 3:14 AM Pillow Talk Nemo",
