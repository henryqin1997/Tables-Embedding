    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{172010=After another fire sale last offseason, the Marlins were left with a gutted roster and an anemic offensive attack. The team's starting pitching was actually a plus in 2013, but it was clear they needed to add some pieces to the lineup, even if they were just short-term fixes for the rebuilding franchise., 116748=The Orioles could still use an impact starting pitcher, a late-inning reliever and a power bat to fill the DH role. They were a surprise playoff team in 2012, but they were unable to keep pace this past season and look to have fallen even further behind the pack with their lack of activity this offseason., 212585=After a disappointing 2013 season saw the Giants follow up their second title in three years with a 76-86 record, the team had some obvious areas they needed to address this offseason. However, their main focus again was retaining their own free agents, as Hunter Pence was extended at the end of the regular season before the team re-upped with Tim Lincecum, Javier Lopez and Ryan Vogelsong\u00a0this winter., 190083=*2013 stats in Japan, 217236=*2012 Stats, 143304=As with years past, pitching remains the biggest question mark for the Rockies. The team took a chance by acquiring Brett Anderson, who has all the talent to be a frontline starter but has failed to make more than 19 starts in a season since 2009., 167874=Speedster Dee Gordon is the only backup infielder currently slated to make the Opening Day roster, and he has only ever played shortstop over an extended period of time. Guerrero remains an unknown commodity, and a good 2013 still doesn't erase how bad Uribe was the previous two seasons, so a backup infielder who is capable of stepping in at either spot would be a good addition. Re-signing Michael Young may be the best option, though., 218369=Hart missed all of 2013 with a pair of knee surgeries, and Morrison has been injury prone since his rookie season, but both are potential impact bats if they can stay on the field. Adding veterans John Buck and Willie Bloomquist to the bench were nice moves as well., 158112=The back end of the starting rotation is something of a question mark with Wade David and Danny Duffy currently penciled into the final two spots. However, top prospects Yordano Ventura and Kyle Zimmer are both expected to see the majors in 2014, so they could be the answers there. Besides that, the team looks set to build on a solid second half to the 2013 season., 157330=The Royals entered the offseason in need of a replacement for Ervin Santana in the starting rotation and upgrades at both second base and right field. They had those three areas addressed before Christmas and now look poised to make a run at their first playoff appearance since 1985., 232083=The Rangers looked to be set to enter the 2014 season before Derek Holland went down with a freak knee injury that will sideline him until midseason. Colby Lewis will get a chance to win the vacated rotation spot, but he has not pitched since July of 2012 while dealing with injuries, so adding another starter seems like a must., 157633=Jason Vargas was signed to a four-year, $32 million deal to replace Santana, Omar Infante got a four-year, $30.25 million deal to take over at second base, and Norichika Aoki was acquired from the Milwaukee Brewers in a trade for left-handed reliever Will Smith. The team also picked up Danny Valencia in a trade, and he should help light a fire under Mike Moustakas, if nothing else., 129999=The White Sox began rebuilding last August, when they dealt Jake Peavy and Alex Rios, and they have continued adding young talent this offseason., 171901=*2012 stats, 143997=Given the injury history of Anderson, some additional starting pitching depth would be nice. Reinforcements could come from the minor leagues though, as top prospects Jonathan Gray and Eddie Butler should both be called up at some point in 2014. A proven bat in left field would be nice, but unless they sign Nelson Cruz, no one left on the market would provide much of an upgrade., 166823=*2012 stats in Cuba, 213013=Finally out from under the Barry Zito contract, veteran Tim Hudson was signed to replace him in the starting rotation. Hudson had his 2013 season cut short by a broken ankle, but all signs point to him being ready for the start of 2014. The team also upgraded in left field by signing low-cost, high-reward slugger Michael Morse, who looks like a prime candidate to bounce back., 207950=Starting pitching has been an issue for the Padres the past few seasons, but the emergence of Andrew Cashner and Tyson Ross in the second half last season, coupled with the addition of Ian Kennedy at the deadline, already had them looking better heading into 2014. They then added perhaps the most attractive bounce-back candidate on the market in Josh Johnson on a one-year deal., 199540=The Phillies lost 89 games last season, their highest total since they went 65-97 back in 2000. And at this point, it's clear that their window for title contention has closed. Rather than begin rebuilding, though, they have opted to make a handful of additions this offseason that should allow them to make a run at .500., 153651=At this point, it's still about getting young guys playing time and deciding who fits into the team's future plans. Signing a shortstop as insurance to Jonathan Villar would make sense, but for the most part, they'll continue to evaluate in-house options. An extension for Castro could also be a smart move after the catcher turned in a breakout 2013 season., 129852=*Triple-A stats, ~2012 stats, +2013 stats in Cuba, 199881=Marlon Byrd will be 36, and after a surprise 2013 season, he is a prime candidate for some sharp regression. Veteran catcher Carlos Ruiz was also re-signed to a three-year deal despite a big drop in his offensive production last season, while Roberto Hernandez may wind up taking a rotation spot from one of the team's younger starting options., 112360=From a roster standpoint, the Braves don't have any glaring needs, though adding another veteran starter would be a smart move.\u00a0Extending one or more of their young core pieces this offseason would have been nice, but it is not a necessity, as they're all still under team control beyond 2014., 203724=The Pirates made a pair of fantastic additions last offseason, signing Francisco Liriano and Russell Martin as free agents. Those two deserve as much credit as anyone for helping the team finally snap their postseason drought and reach the playoffs for the first time since 1992., 264710=Copyright \u00a9 2015 Bleacher Report, Inc.

Navarro has not been an everyday catcher since 2009, but he had a terrific season at the plate with the Cubs last year in a backup role and is still just 29 years old., 227385=It's looking more and more likely that the Rays will hold onto David Price, as they look to contend for a playoff spot once again in 2014. That erases what would have been a major hole in the rotation, though Jake Odorizzi was a prime candidate to take over his rotation spot. As for remaining needs, the team could use another bench piece or two given how often they shuffle the lineup, but there is no glaring hole that needs to be addressed.}",

Think of a grade of \"C\" as being neutral, meaning the team has not gotten any better or any worse this offseason, with the rest of the grades stemming out from there. On the offensive side of things, a trio of players who received qualifying offers remain on the market in Nelson Cruz, Stephen Drew and Kendrys Morales. Draft-pick compensation has hurt all three of their stocks, but they should all find everyday jobs before Opening Day. There are still a number of impact players who have yet to find homes this offseason, due in large part to the waiting game a number of teams were",

Mark Trumbo was acquired to provide a much-needed power bat to protect Paul Goldschmidt, while young closer Addison Reed was picked up to improve the back end of the bullpen. Re-signing Eric Chavez was a good move, as he was the team's top hitter off the bench last year. Henry Blanco will get a chance to replace Wil Nieves as the team's backup catcher, while Matt Tuiasosopo will be in the running for a bench job as well. \u00a0 Remaining Needs Two of their biggest needs were filled via trade, but the Diamondbacks could still use a frontline starter to anchor their staff. Patrick Corbin, Wade Miley and Trevor Cahill are all solid arms, but none profile as a legitimate staff ace. \u00a0 Grade:\u00a0B- \u00ab Prev 3 of 32 Next \u00bb Atlanta Braves",
