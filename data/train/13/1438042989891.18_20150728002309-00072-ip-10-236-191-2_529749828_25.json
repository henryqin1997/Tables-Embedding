The Cold War era tank development kept tank development going hard and new generation of better armoured tanks would have been a hard nut to crack with world War 2 ammunition used in 75 K/40. Finnish military was aware of this and circa 1960 - 1961 it was testing new APDS-type ammunition capable for 220-mm armour penetration from shooting distance of 1,000 meters with 90-degree angle of impact. However apparently this new ammunition type did not see mass production., 95392=2500 m (direct fire), 212536=Military manual: Kentt\u00e4tykist\u00f6n ampumatarvikkeet by Puolustusvoimien P\u00e4\u00e4esikunta Taisteluv\u00e4lineosasto (printed 1940, updates added until 1947)., 185794=Pzgr.40 APCR round (tungsten core, 933 m/sec):, 207689=From those 60 guns lost in summer of 1944 48 belonged to 4th Army Corps (which fought in Carelian Isthmus), 11 belonged to Aunus Group (located north of Lake Ladoga) and only 1 belonged to 3rd Army Corps (in northern parts of Carelian Isthmus). 75 K/40 was the last antitank-gun acquired by Finnish Armed Forces and remained as backbone of Finnish long-range antitank weaponry until being replaced by recoilless rifles and antitank missiles. In 1960's they remained as only antitank-gun type which the Finns still kept reserved for antitank use. By that time time all other World War 2 era antitank-guns in Finnish inventory had already been reserved to other duties. 75 K/40 guns stayed in training use also after the war and remained in antitank weapons inventory of Finnish military until being declared obsolete in year 1986. After that most of the remaining 141 guns were sold to collectors, given to museums or used as monuments., 168503=Finnish soldiers quickly nicknamed these guns \"Mulatti\" (Mulato) after the combined structure from two guns of two different countries. Compared to other Finnish at-guns these were very good so they were issued to units located all over the frontline and saw had battles in frontline. In battles of summer of 1944 seven guns of this type were lost. Four of the lost guns belonged to 4th Army Corps (in Karelian Isthmus) and two belonged to Aunus Group (in northern shore of Lake Ladoga). After World War 2 the remaining 39 guns remained in antitank-weapons inventory of Finnish Army until year 1986. They were also declared obsolete the same year., 202751=21st of February 1944, 169170=Finnish manuals list two AP-shells for this gun: 75 pspkrv 59/66-ps was old French M/1910 APHE-projectile loaded to 75 mm x 338R cartridge case while 75 psa - Vj4 had new AP projectile with 4 second tracer. However firing of \"75 psa - Vj4\" was recommended in extreme emergency only - gun carriage of 75 PstK/97-38 was not strong enough to endure lot of shooting with this ammunition. The recommended antitank ammunion were HEAT-shells. In Finland this meant ammunition with 75 hkr 42-18/24-38 (German 7.5 cm Gr. 38 Hl/B) warheads capable achieving about 75-mm penetration from 60-degree point of impact., 97812=APCR (Pzgr.40) projectile 980 g 1180 m/sec, 203676=Soviet offensive in Karelian Isthmus in summer of 1944 lead to further deliveries:, 166272=PICTURE: Closer look behind gun shield of 75 PstK/97-38 antitank gun.

Besides noting the structural details poorly suiting to Finnish use and the difficulties resulting them, the report also noted that the Italian gun sight was too complicated and armour penetration rather poor for gun of this size. In addition the gun was noted lacking a semiautomatic mechanism used in most antitank-guns. The mechanism would have allowed for it to automatically remove cartridge case and leave the breech open after firing a shot, so this resulted a slower rate of fire. The report ended with suggestion, that if equipped with more suitable (simple) gun sight and suitable HE-round, the gun might be suitable as a bunker gun. However the report apparently didn't lead to any measures., 26396=- \"Deutsche and alliierte heereswaffen 1939 - 1945\"(APCR?):, 211933=Kurt Sallaz and Peter Riklin: Bewaffnung und Ausr\u00fcstung der Schweizer Armee seit 1817, Panzer und Panzerabwehr., 29412=1000 m, 137632=Units with 50 PstK/38 antitank guns in 1st of May 1944:, 8692=HE 2135 g projectile 340 m/sec, 134052=Finnish use: 27 guns were imported from Germany in summer of 1942, they remained in use of Finnish frontline units until end of World War 2., 145039=1190 kg, 120142=Pzgr.40 APCR round (1198 m/sec):, 212888=50 mm panssarintorjuntakanuuna vuodelta 1938 (50 K/38), (published 1943)., 204281=July of 1944, 76028=- \"Die Bewaffnung des \u00d6sterreichischen etc\" (47 PstK/35 with Austrian APHE 1450 g projectile 650 m/sec):, 166564=Finland had bought 48 French 75-mm field guns model 1897 (called 75 K 97 in Finland) and 50,000 shells from France in 1940. Barrels of the bought guns were in terribly wear down condition and dispersion in arch fire was unacceptably large. Year 1942 all 75 K 97 field guns were gathered away from fortification artillery batteries that had used them. By February of 1943 the Finns had decided to check if the Germans were willing to build them 7,5 cm Pak 97/38 antitank-guns from 60 gun barrels of 75 K 97 that the Finns had. An agreement was achieved and the Germans manufactured 46 antitank guns for the Finns by using delivered gun barrels., 65983=PICTURE: 47 PstK/39 antitank-gun being used for beach defence.

Also the structure of towing system proved to have problems in high towing speeds, so it was modified, guns with this improvement were named as m/37. Modification of towing system was not totally successful, so further improvements were made and they resulted introducing m/38. One important technical difference for these guns was also in semi-automatic (after firing a shot it removed used cartridge case was remained open for the next round) breech system used in these guns. In m/32 the semiautomatic-mechanism worked only with APHE-ammunition, which meant reduced rate-of-fire with other ammunition types (such as high explosive). All versions starting from m/37 had improved semi-automatic mechanism, which worked also with other ammunition types. Later more easily produced version called m/38-41 was introduced. The main reason why Finnish Army decided to separate these guns to different models was the spare-parts maintenance - spare parts of various Russian 45-mm antitank-gun were not necessarily interchangeable between various gun models. Year 1941 the Soviets were surprised by German invasion and after suffering heavy losses found themselves with shortage of antitank-guns. In that situation they introduced improvised emergency version of 45-mm antitank-gun, which they named model 1941 and Finnish Army accordingly named 45 PstK/41. Basically 45 PstK/41 had 45 Psv.K/38 tank-gun installed on rudimentary improvised antitank-gun mount. Finnish Army captured four of these improvised antitank-guns, but apparently did not take any of them to its own use. Once the Soviets got their industry sorted out and antitank-gun manufacturing running again they introduced normal-quality version of 45-mm antitank-gun with notably longer (L/66) barrel known as antitank-gun m/42., 134484=The Germans started having doubts about effectiveness of 3,7 cm Pak already during Spanish Civil War, so Rheinmetall started development of new 5-cm antitank gun in 1938. It took until late 1940 from them to start issuing new 5 cm Pak to their troops and even than production was quite slow early on (still in 1st of June 1941 German troops located to east had only 107 guns of this type). 5-cm Pak proved a success, with new tungsten-cored Pzgr. 40 ammunition it was able to take out all Allied medium tanks such as T-34/76 and M4 Sherman. However, the shortage of tungsten needed for production of Pzgr.40 projectiles and ever thickening armour in tanks finally were too much for it also, so production of these guns was ended in 1943, by that time over 9,500 had been made. As typical to German antitank-guns this gun had semi-automatic breech system with horizontal sliding breech block., 175113=10500 m (indirect fire) / 2000 m (direct fire), 167920=25th of March 1943, 204614=August of 1944, 203093=4th of March 1944, 81278=- \"Panzerabwehrkanonen 1916 - 1977:\" (Swiss 47-mm B\u00f6hler at-gun m/35, projectile presumably APHE-T?):, 193873=Pzgr.40 APCR round (tungsten core, 990 m/sec):, 75624=- Italian APHE-T 1450 g projectile 595 m/sec, 80045=- \"Panzerabwehrkanonen 1916 - 1977:\" (Italian 47/32 Mod. 39, projectile presumably APHE-T?):, 204855=This was the most powerful antitank-gun in Finnish inventory during World War 2. Typically referred simply as 75 K/40 (75-mm cannon model 1940), it was powerful but heavy and therefore difficult to manhandle if compared to other Finnish-used antitank-guns. Finnish antitank-gun companies in year 1944 can be divided to three categories: Divisional, (infantry) regimental and those belonging (new at that time) (infantry) brigades. Divisional antitank-gun companies were the ones, which got 50-mm and 75-mm antitank guns. Antitank-gun companies belonging to infantry regiments and grigades had to do with less effective German 37-mm and Soviet 45-mm antitank guns. However, this did not mean that even some of the divisional antitank-gun companies would not have been armed with 37-mm and 45-mm antitank-guns. The number of 75 K/40 at-guns delivered to Finland after beginning of Soviet offensive at summer of 1944 could only barely replace battle losses. Hence there was little chance of replacing older and less effective antitank-guns with them in any real significant scale., 206186=PICTURE: Another sample of 75 K/40 antitank gun.

When delivered it was the most powerful and only antitank gun in Finnish use capable of reliably destroying T-34 tanks, so in late June of 1944 the Finns still expressed to be willing to get these guns delivered instead of heavier 75-mm antitank guns. However, reading battle reports makes clear that knocking out T-34/85 tanks with this gun was not exactly easy. It practically always demanded a positition that allowed shooting from side of the tank and close shooting range to succeed. PstK/38 was the first antitank gun in Finnish inventory that was too heavy for gun crew of few men to effectively push it around, so in situations in which gun positions were about to be overrun by Soviet infantry this made taking the gun with the retreating crew quite problematic. While arranged in travel-mode 50 PstK/38 weight 886 kilograms and Finnish Army was operating the gun with gun crew of 11 men (plus two drivers for motor vehicles). Unlike lighter guns this antitank-gun had also been designed for motorized towing only, hence it could not be towed with horse(s). Considering small number of these guns in use of Finnish Army to begin with, the number of 50 PstK/38 lost in battle during summer of 1944 was very high with only 15 guns surviving the war. The small number of surviving guns may have been a factor for these guns being removed from antitank-weaponry in use of Finnish military already that same year. After World War 2 they were warehoused, but not declared obsolete until year 1986. In late 1980's three guns were sold to collectors and the rest given to museums., 211772=\"Panzerabwehrkanonen 1916 - 1977\" by Franz Koser., 212714=Military manual: Jalkav\u00e4en Ampumatarvikkeet I by Puolustusvoimien P\u00e4\u00e4esikunta Taisteluv\u00e4lineosasto (printed 1941, updated until September 1944)., 142092=It is worth noting that there was rather limited number of 50 psl-Vj2 aka Pz.Gr 40 APCR-T in Finnish use. What is known the only delivery of this ammunition happened in June of 1942 and contained 944 rounds. Shortage of tungsten stopped German production of ammunition with tungsten cores, which explains not having later deliveries. The Germans developed also HEAT-T bombquite similar to Stielgrenade 41 for their 50-mm antitank-guns, but Finnish Army never acquired any., 77278=- \"Tanks vs Armour\" (47 PstK/39 with Italian APHE 1440 g projectile 630 m/sec):, 107609=Pzgr.40 APCR round (tungsten core, 1198 m/sec):, 7812=Soviet APHE-T 1430 g projectiles 760 m/s, 212059=Article: 75 K/40, Panssarintorjunnan selk\u00e4ranka kes\u00e4ll\u00e4 1944 by Kari Kuusela in Suomen Sotilas magazine vol. 4/2004., 60758=Losses of captured 45-mm Soviet antitank-guns during period 9th of June - 7th of July 1944:, 136347=December of 1942, 157863=- Finnish live fire testing year 1943 (\"75 psa - Vj4\", AP-T, 590 m/sec):, 71805=47 PstK/35: 2000 m (direct fire), 164810=After running to new Allied medium and heavy tanks (such as Soviet T-34 and KV-1) the Germans found out that they needed antitank guns more powerful than 50 mm Pak. As a stop gap solution this 75-mm antitank gun was introduced. It basically combined gun barrel of French 75-mm model 1897 field gun equipped with muzzle-break to carriage of German 5.0 cm Pak 38. Ammunition used typically included captured French HE-rounds, captured Polish AP-rounds and German made HEAT-rounds, however using AP-rounds was not favoured and HEAT was the main ammunition type in antitank use with German troops. Reason for this was quite simple: The gun was quite unstable and recoil with AP-rounds was so fearsome that the Germans nicknamed this gun type as \"Mustang\". This gun was introduced to German troops in November of 1941 and in years 1941 - 1942 some 700 guns of this type were manufactured. According some sources the total production totalled about 3700 guns. 7.5 cm Pak 97/38 as Germans called it was far from perfect, but it worked and was cheap to produce (cost and need of work were about two thirds of what was needed with 7.5 cm Pak 40)., 199620=Finnish use: 210 Guns bought from Germany and delivered 1943 - 1944. They were mainly used to replace smaller antitank guns and remained in Finnish frontline antitank guns even long after World War 2., 93406=550 - 1180 m/sec, 168259=16th of June 1943, 136590=Also Finnish military became aware of need acquiring more effective antitank-guns after facing number of T-34 and KV-1 tanks in battles of year of 1941. So Finland bought 27 of these antitank-guns from Germany in year 1942. Guns of the first delivery were issued to Finnish troops in August of 1942. They were basically distributed to all main directions of Finnish front, as first delivery was issued to antitank gun companies of Groups of Maaselk\u00e4 and Aunus while 12 guns from second shipment were given to Isthmus Group and Armour Division. Each of these received enough (6 guns) PstK/38 to equip one antitank(-gun) company., 98251=HE projectile 1960 g 550 m/sec, 206542=Finnish troops lost 60 guns of this type in battles of summer 1944. At that time this gun type was the best antitank-gun in Finnish use. Unlike other antitank-guns in Finnish inventory, 75 K/40 was powerful enough to be punch throught frontal arch of almost all enemy tanks. However large weight of these guns made manhandling them to position and off with men practically impossible. This resulted the need to pick the gun position very carefully each time, since the towing vehicle would have be able to get to the gun and gun crew had to prepare for leaving the position with little warning time if situation started looking too risky. Also captured Komsomolets A-20 towing tractors (which the Finns used as towing vehicles of antitank guns in many units) barely had enough power for towing them even on road. Finnish Army operated 75 K/40 antitank-gun with gun crew of 13 men (plus two drivers for motor vehicles). The gun had two sights for direct fire (main telescopic sight and emergency backup sight) and was also equipped for indirect fire, although Finnish military using them for indirect fire seems to have been rare at best., 50560=The reasoning behind Soviet 45-mm antitank-gun model 1941 was quite simple, it was introduced in hurried times of 1941 when the Soviets needed any weapons that could get fast. Since they already had existing spare 45-mm tank guns, why not put them into good use as improvised antitank-guns. Later m/42 antitank-gun with its longer barrel was an effort of trying to get more muzzle velocity out of existing ammunition and therefore better armour penetration capability. When introduced in early 1930's Soviet 45-mm at-gun was excellent weapon, at that time its AP shell had enough power to punch through both walls of typical tanks of that time. Year 1939 it still was more effective than most antitank-guns of that time and was powerful enough to be threat to all existing tanks. Fast progress of tanks during World War 2 left it behind, new medium and heavy tanks proved difficult or impossible for it to kill and by end of the war it had become quite outdated as antitank-gun. However besides armour piercing shells, these guns had also high explosive shells, which were highly effective for gun of this caliber range. The Soviets also used their 45-mm antitank-guns routinely for direct fire support in the frontline, so powerful HE-shells proved highly useful. All Soviet 45-mm antitank-guns were suitable both to motorized towing and being towed with horses. Two horses and a limber were needed for towing the gun., 211332=Jyri Paulaharju: Itsen\u00e4isen Suomen kentt\u00e4tykit 1918 - 1995., 64743=As mentioned year 1948 2 Finnish military still had 475 of captured Soviet 45-mm antitank-guns. After the war those 45-mm antitank-guns, that still remained, were warehoused. Even if quite outdated they were still so numerous, that they remained reserved for antitank use with Finnish military until year 1960. After that they were re-named as infantry guns and their role changed accordingly. Finnish coastal defence troops had used these guns already during Continuation War and after World War 2 coastal defence simply received more of them, since the Army no longer had such need for them. In their coastal (beach defence) role they remained in Finnish use until late 1980's or so and also special fixed gun mount was introduced for this use. Since early 1990's remaining guns have been sold to museums and collectors little by little., 202147=Second deal of purchase was negotiated in March of 1943. Deliveries following it:, 201197=23rd of May 1943, 139812=Losses of 50 PstK/38 antitank-guns during period 9th of June - 7th of July 1944:, 213072=Military manual: 75 mm:n panssarintorjuntakanuuna vuodelta 1940 (published 1943)., 121302=- Finnish live fire testing year 1943 (\"50 pspekr 22/27\", German APHE, 835 m/sec):, 85154=PICTURE: Gun crews posing with their 47 PstK/35 antitank-guns.

CLICK THUMBNAIL TO SEE LARGER PIC (134 KB)., 57991=About half of the ammunition that Finnish military used with these guns was captured, while the other half was Finnish made. Finnish production for armour piercing high explosive tracer (APHE-T) ammunition started in VTT (Valtion Tykkitehdas = State Artillery factory) in late 1940 and manufacturing of high explosive (HE) ammunition started year 1942. Also Finnish armour piercing tracer (AP-T) ammunition was introduced to manufacturing in year 1942. During World War 2 Finnish industry manufactured almost 112,000 AP-T + APHE-T rounds and over 358,000 HE rounds. In addition 15,000 HE rounds and 15,000 APHE rounds were bought from Germany in year 1944. Soviet ammunition inventory for these guns included also more potent armour piercing composite rigid (APCR) ammunition, but captured APCR ammunition is not listed in Finnish ammunition manuals. So it is quite likely that none or only very small number of APCR rounds was captured. Anyway Soviet production of APCR-ammunition for these guns does not seem to have started until year 1942, at which point the Finnish attack had stopped and capturing large amount of Soviet equipment had become rare. Finnish troops captured only two long-barrel M/42 antitank guns. They were both captured in summer of 1944 (first one in Kuuterselk\u00e4 battle in mid-June of 1944) and Finnish military never used them., 30444=2000 m, 210755=Alex Buchner: Deutsche and alliierte heereswaffen 1939 - 1945., 52284=Finnish troops captured some 125 Soviet 45-mm antitank-guns during Winter War. As the Finns had serious shortage of antitank-guns the captured guns were very soon pressed to Finnish use. Finnish soldiers compared the 45-mm Soviet antitank-guns to 37-mm Bofors guns and considered Soviet 45-mm gun to be somewhat rough on the edges when it to manufacturing quality, but effective. It did not take long until Antitank Training Centre started training crews for captured 45-mm antitank-guns and the Finns lost couple of these guns in combat already during Winter War. June of 1940 93 of the 45-mm antitank-guns captured in Winter War remained in Finnish use and M/32 was the most common model of 45-mm antitank-guns in Finnish use at that time. During first three months of Continuation War in year 1941 Finnish troops captured much larger number of 45-mm antitank-guns - almost 400 guns were captured those months. During the trench war period (Dec 1941 - June 1944) their number in use of Finnish military peaked to some 670 guns. Very few antitank-guns were captured or lost during the trench war period Continuation War in January 1942 - May 1944. Once the Soviet offensive started in June of 1944 the battles of summer 1944 proved very costly to 45-mm antitank-guns existing in Finnish use with Finnish military losing dozens of guns. But in last battles they were again captured in large numbers, so in the end the total number in Finnish use did not drop that much by end of World War 2. Even after the guns who were in worst shape had been scrapped after the war, year 1948 Finnish Army still had 475 of 45-mm antitank-guns in its inventory., 127679=- Finnish live fire testing year 1943 (\"50 psl-Vj2\", German APCR, 1080 m/sec):, 41134=Finnish live fire testing year 1943 (\"45 psa - Vj4\", Finnish AP-T, 760 m/sec):, 212200=Article: Panssarintorjuntamme kehittyminen 1944 - 1964 by Jouni Laari (Journal of Military History 26)., 97371=APHE-T (Pzgr.38) projectile 2060 g 830 m/sec, 47507=Finnish use: Finnish military captured maybe about 700 or so Soviet 45-mm antitank-guns during World War 2.

Soon they were removed from frontline use and reissued to coastal defence troops of Lake Ladoga. In spring of 1942 they were transferred to Finnish Navy and remained in there until end of World War 2. After that they remained warehoused until being sold to Interarms and shipped abroad in 1960., 210630=Werner Haupt: Panzerabwehrgesch\u00fctze 3,7 cm - 5,0 cm - 7,5 cm - 8,8 cm-Pak 1934 - 1945 ohne Selbstfahrlafetten., 47074=2500 m, 8249=Finnish APHE-T 1400 g projectile 750 - 760 m/s, 211122=Article of Risto Erjola: Ampumatarvikkeet sotien 1939 - 1945 aikana Suomessa (Tiede ja Ase, Suomen sotahistoriallisen vuosiseuran julkaisu N:o 48, 1990)., 208634=Finnish Army used all the four ammunition types listed above, but Pzgr.40 APCR-round was very rare in Finnish use. This is because only small number of this ammunition type was delivered in Finland (at least one shipment seems to have arrived in June - August of 1943). Besided the ammunition listed here the Germans had also less effective Hl/A and more effective Hl/C HEAT-rounds, but these does not seem to have been delivered to Finland.

Production started late 1941 and some 1,360 were sent to frontline troops in 1942. Production continued until collapse of Germany and totalled about 23,300 guns. The gun had been designed for motorised towing and could also be equipped for indirect fire. It also had breech system with horizontal sliding breech block and semi-automatic mechanism, which removed cartridge case after firing the shot and left breech open for the next round., 211841=Rolf M.

The guns remained in Finnish antitank-weapon inventory until year 1960. The Soviets had realised that they needed antitank-guns already in late 1920's and first bought 37-mm antitank-guns from German firm Rheinmetall, but soon they also started developing their own versions. Soviet 45-mm at-gun m/32 was basically a slightly enlarged version of early German 37-mm antitank-gun, with wooden wheels and all. Largest differences (other the calibre and larger size) were in sights and production methods. Only few years later the wooden wheels were replaced with rubber wheels, which had spokes and were more suitable for faster towing speeds (read: motorised towing). Also the structure of towing system proved to have problems in high towing speeds, so it was modified, guns with this improvement were named as m/37. Modification of towing system was not totally successful, so further improvements were made and they resulted introducing m/38. One important technical difference for these guns was also in semi-automatic (after firing a shot it removed used cartridge case was remained open for the next round) breech system used in these guns. In m/32 the semiautomatic-mechanism worked only with APHE-ammunition, which meant reduced rate-of-fire with other ammunition types (such as high explosive). All versions starting from m/37 had improved semi-automatic mechanism, which worked also with other ammunition types. Later more easily produced version called m/38-41 was introduced.
