            "Los Angeles City College is very diverse, a great place to socialise and meet new people from other cultures.",
            "There is a pool and arcade place in front of the school.",
            "There's a coffee place in the school. Outside of school there is a Japanese restaurant where you can sushi, a Mexican food restaurant, Jack in the Box, Cesar's Pizza Pizza, Subway, an Italian restaurant that has really good pizza and much more.",
            "Be proactive, do you work, ask questions, and talk to you professors about your future.",
            "Out of one to ten I would rate Los Angeles City College a ten from all the other community colleges in the district of Los Angeles. Besides the fact that some of staff members in the office are not resourceful, the professors are wonderful, and truly care about your future goals, at least in the music department."

Great for these types of students it's a good place for every type of student. the best thing is that students who are undecided with there majors can figure out what they want to do at this school and it isn't pricey. What to do for fun it's right in the middle of los angeles and the bus could get you anywhere that you need to go. the red line could take you to north hollywood or to downtown. there's also many things to do that are walking distance.",
