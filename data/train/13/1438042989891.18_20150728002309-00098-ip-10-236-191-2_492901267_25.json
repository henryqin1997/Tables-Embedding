Event times are specified as time intervals starting from a baseline system time 00:00:00:00:00:00 [yymmddhhmmss] for Jan. 1, 1970 (the transaction processor includes a battery assisted hardware clock synchronyzed to this baseline system time)., 255773=[0412] When an event time is reached, and the associated activity is completed, the event time is incremented by the event interval, based on the previous event time and not on when the activity was actually completed. For example, if host/remote file transfers to support global update activities (i.e., transfers of negative status records and selected customer records are to be accomplished every 15 minutes, then each activity is entered into the event file with an interval of 15:00[mmss]. The activity will be entered into the event file, along with its event interval and its initial event time of 15 minutes after system initialization (assumed to be 00:00[mmss]). The activity will then first be executed at 15:00, and when the activity is completed, the associated event time will be incremented to 30:00.}",
