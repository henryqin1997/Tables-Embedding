            "Being on the campus itself is okay, but I would NEVER recommend walking by yourself as a woman on or off of campus. If you feel unsafe, they have a police escort service and are willing to walk with you to your dorm or car. There are some shady characters around the College Park area, so you must be attentive and aware of your surroundings at all times.",
            "So much Greek life...we have Frat row and countless sorority and frat houses that are behind the main strip. The week of Greek games is absolutely insane and unfortunately, we have the obligation of claiming Rebecca Martensen as one of our fellow terps.",
            "So many great campus organizations that you can find out about at the first look fair, which occurs at the beginning of every semester. Ranging from sailing, to catan club, and even Cru Christian ministry, there is just about every type of club imaginable. Plus, there are countless club and intramural sports teams to become involved in.",
            "Outgoing, social, assertive, go-getter, the erudite student, focused, determined, and the extreme multi-tasker that thrives in high pressure situations.",
            "Rubbing Testudo's nose every time that you pass the statue is a must... and also make sure that you take a swim in the fountain at least once during your college career.",
            "The location is super ideal; so many internship opportunities are in this area and I love the Urban feeling without being in the heart of DC.",
            "Go into DC, hang out on Route 1 and get food, play intramural sports, work out at the gym, and hang out with people to party.",
            "The food is tolerable and they have one of the largest selections for vegetarians...definitely not your mom's cooking, but there are still relatively healthy choices (and not so healthy if it's what your heart desires). Make sure to try our ice cream that is homemade on campus- you will not want any other type of ice cream after trying it!",
            "I loved the community and how easy it was to make friends in this setting, but the dorms at UMD are very noisy and not a very good place to try to get homework accomplished. If you want to study, go to the library; if you want to hang out, stay in the dorm.",
            "As a Biochemistry/Neurophysiology double degree, I have been throughly challenged during my time as a student, to say the least. Many late nights, all nighters, and I don't even know how many gallons of coffee later, I am a senior and the end is in sight.",
            "It can sometimes be very easy to get lost in a sea of faces unless you get involved. Don't let the advisors push you around; you have to be your own advocate. Please do not act like an idiot and sacrifice anything and everything to Testudo the week of finals.",
            "It is a big school atmosphere with tons of exciting things going on all of the time. There is a very serious academic environment here and there is a large pressure to succeed. Maryland students tend to be segregated depending upon the major; science majors on one side of the campus and humanities majors on the other."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{427523=The classes are rigorous and challenging, but never impossible. Those who work hard to obtain a good grade generally take the most away from their classes. Certain majors are harder to get into because they are L.E.P's, or Limited Enrollment Programs - however the requirements differ for each program, and are never unfair. It is rather simple to establish a good relationship with your professors, especially after you complete the majority of your core classes; it is even easier to establish a good relationship with your TA's. The average student to teacher ratio is 18:1, allowing for close relationships with both teachers and peers., 701101=Heaters: I sweated through the better part of 2012. They aren't terrible but nothing to feel lucky about; you definitely have to make the most of your space although many people were able to get their own rooms as people moved out. If at all possible: go for the new Oakland building, it's by far the best dorm available., 627835=There is a tradition since 1993 where if you touch the nose of the college mascot Testudo you will receive good luck. Also if you leave Testudo offerings on his statue you will also have good luck during final exam time., 682078=I had a nice dorm with AC, this year (2012) not all the dorms had AC but I belive that in fall 2013 all dorms should have AAC., 497504=There are many things to do. UMD was rated number one in athletic facilities in 2010 and it is evident in the finely furnished gym and outdoor and indoor pool area. There is even a rock climbing/ obstacle course on campus. There are many fields and courts to play sports on around the campus. The DC metro is right near campus so the DC nightlife and daytime recreational activities are accessible., 463517=Expect weekly emails and texts from UMDAlert. The campus is incredibly safe. I feel safe running at 11 o'clock at night during the weeknights., 416111=Good teachers are everything. Before you register, fist check all the review of the professor teaching your classes. My advice is to pick the best teacher even if it is at 8 o'clock in the morning. Be sure to get to know people in your classes as study groups help immensely in large lectures tha you'll undoubtedly be enrolling in. The final piece of advice is to live a balanced, but focused, life. Don't spend all your time studying, but when you do study, make the most out of it. Learn how to have fun, get good grades, and be involved with different activities all at the same time. This will help you succeed in college., 1029984=There has been a rivalry between Duke's basketball team and UMD's. Every year, the home game against Duke is the most lively. In 2013, UMD beat Duke twice after having not beaten then for years. There was a bonfire and non-violent rioting through the streets on Baltimore Ave. It was so amazing to see all the students come out and celebrate UMD's victory. This is a day everyone will always remember., 310451=the university of maryland is an excellect school and i am looking forward to determining my major beginning in the fall of 2012. i am in my second year attending anne arundel county community college with recent acceptance from the university of maryland., 216098=Make sure you apply early, dont wait for the later deadline, have your application in by the end of December. Make sure your SAT's are in a good range (1800+). I felt like Maryland really looked at those over other things. If you are coming to UMD, MAKE SURE YOU ASK OTHERS ABOUT TEACHERS. Whatever classes you signed up for, make sure your taking the best teacher. IT really doest matter when it comes down to it for grades. Ourumd.com. Great site for reviews and statistics. Use It!, 1053114=HUGE. Although, of course the fraternities are much more respected and taken care of than the sororities. But, Greek life is huge. Maybe 1:4 people are a part of it if not more. Greek row is an amazing site and always active with excitement and willing to recruit. I hear hazing is tough though, so spots are well deserved. Plus, theres a greek family for every type of person., 94917=This school is considered one of the few Public Ivy Leagues school, meaning, for a fraction of the price of Harvard or Princeton, or any of those other Ivy Leagues, you can get just as amazing as education! The faculty consists of many award winning members and even a handful of Nobel Peace Prize winners! The $8000 in state and $11000 out of state tuition is definitely makes it that much better! Ivy League education for the price of a state college!, 1097929=Visit campus! It is a very big school and that intimidates some people, but is invigorating for others. It's best to stand on the grounds of really any school you're applying to just to get a feel for it. UMD was the first school I visited and I remember telling my mom I didn't want to go back to high school and that I was ready to move in that day. So I think being physically at a school can tell you a lot about whether it's for you or not. (And don't forget: November 1st is the priority deadline! ALWAYS apply priority deadline!), 673523=The Food and Dining programs at UMD is brought into question on a regular basis from the on campus students. There are 2 options for on campus dining at UMD. First, there are dining points. These, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?points\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2? are used at any dining hall at the University. You actually pay more for less points. Seem ridiculous, but thats just how it works. Many freshman boys are calling their parents midway through november saying, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?Yea, so mom, I am out of points, can you give me more.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2? Usually by the end of the semester you are calling on one of the girls in your dorm who only ate salad for the semester to buy you food. The next option is Terp bucks. Terp bucks can be used at any restaurant, dining hall, or convince store on campus. They go right onto your student ID, and you can use them wherever. The University recommends students to get points, however, I do not understand the logic behind this., 748601=In general I'm very happy with the Stuff and professors I have taken classes with. I'm a Persian studies major and most of my professors have been amazing. However, I have to say that the University makes a lot of money by giving students parking tickets. Sometimes they make mistakes and give you a ticket, but forget to void it, so you have to be very careful where you park and what are the rules. If you don't know or not sure, always ask the officers or talk to someone in the transportation. Also, you have to be careful with advising because they will tell you something like you will graduate in May, but when it comes down to it you find out you have to take 12 more credits. It is all about how to take money from students. Other than that I really enjoy this university., 274365=SAT is important to get into this school. Work hard at high school and also try studying for SAT so you can get around 1800 out of 2400 or higher. Actually, to tell the truth... SAT isn't everything. In my case, I did not get high score for SAT but I had worked really hard in high school that I had higher than 4.0 GPA and I joined many different sports teams, clubs, speach teams. I also attended several youth programs in government and UN. I focused not only the school stuff but also volunteering works too. Every school year, I did at least an hour of volunteering per week and during summer break I spent about 60-100 hours for helping people. I believe, if you can't get good score on SAT, you should try what I have done to show UMD how passionate and smart person you are.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot I recently completed my first year at Maryland this past Spring and after looking back on my learning experiences at the university, I can definitely say that I have learned and will continue to learn a lot while attending this school. Not only will one who attends this school learn a lot throughout academics, but they will also learn a lot about themselves. As an incoming freshmen I was excited, scared, and nervous. There was the stress of making new friends, getting good grades, and making the most of the college experience. Maryland is a big school with many people looking to make friends. When you meet new people (and trust me, you will) you will learn about others as well as yourself as you continue to grow throughout college. College is much different than high school and at Maryland you will find the classes to be challenging but with the resources and availability of tutors, teaching assistant, as well as professors, you can get as much help as you need to assure yourself that you understand the material that is taught. As far as making the most of the college experience goes, college is the best opportunity to try new things and Maryland has endless opportunities for students including clubs, sporting events, intramural sports, etc. Login to rate or flag the reviews",
