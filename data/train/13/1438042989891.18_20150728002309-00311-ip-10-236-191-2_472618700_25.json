A little after this a number of silver versions of Dino-rang began turning up in stores.

It currently seems that they will not be able to be levelled up higher in the new game. Because of this it will be important to distinguish the Skylanders Giants figures from the originals. As well as different packaging the Giants figures will have an orange baseplate, rather than the green baseplate of the original figures. Skylanders Giants is not only a new adventure but introduces new Giant/Normal characters as well as extending levels of the old characters. The old figures are supported in the new game, complete with any leveling up and hats they have from the original game. However only the new Skylanders Giants versions of the figures will be able to take advantage of the additional levels.

The bigger items, pirate ships and the like, provide an entire new adventure for you to play through with your Skylander toys in the game.
