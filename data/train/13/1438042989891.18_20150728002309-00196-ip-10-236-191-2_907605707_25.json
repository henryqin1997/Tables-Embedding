    "textAfterTable": "Academic Rigor The standards at Monterey peninsula college are very high, as at all collleges. Always be your best at being a good student. Grades are very competivie. Just because you have friends at your college, remember you are competing with them for education so give schooling your best. Tips for prospective students Students in the future be prepared to have to do a lot of paper work. Have all of you documentation in a place you can always find. When you get a paper of document make copies for your own proof. In three sentences I rate Monterey Peninsula College an 8.5. I rate them this because they are and excellent college but they could still use some work. This college has helped me come closer to my degree and career.
