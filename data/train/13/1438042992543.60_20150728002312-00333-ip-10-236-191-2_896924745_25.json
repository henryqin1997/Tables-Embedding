            "It is gated, and after 10 p.m. you have to have a sticker to enter onto the campus.",
            "The Greek life is pretty active. They are always doing something on campus.",
            "The frats and sorieties usually throw a lot of activities on campus, and the night life in natchitoches is not horrible. There are 2 clubs that usually everybody goes to.",
            "Cafeteria food is cafeteria food, there is nothing spectacular about it. But it is not horrible and there is generally a huge variety of food.",
            "You have apartment style dorms and then regular dorms. The regular dorms are almost like the apartment style ones just without the stove. If you stay in the 2 bedroom regular dorms, you will get your own bathroom, which is pretty cool.",
            "I wouldn't say the curriculum is easy but it is also not impossible or difficult. Since there are less students and it is not a big community, teachers are more available for one on one time.",
            "If you are not a fan of a party town or a big community, this is the perfect place for you. You will get to know everbody, and everybody will get to know you. Plan on seeing the same people when you go into Walmart or out.",
            "Very small community, so teachers are able to help out students more. If you are an athlete, this would be the perfect school to attend. Everybody knows you."

Late May. Freshman run across field during first football game., 27336=I graduated in May with my Bachelor's. The amount of information I learned in such a short time was amazing. Now I am working on my graduate degree., 55992=The campus is constantly giving every type of student options to do what they would enjoy. The school sends out mass e-mails for bathe-a-dog day, sports game days and times, holiday activities for every holiday, theatrical shows, and many more. There are also several things off campus to engage in such as the yearly Natchitoches Festival of lights in December or the Natchitoches Meat Pie Festival, etc., 139714=Stay in contact with your advisor. He/she is very important during your first semester, in fact you can't even schedule your classes for the fall or spring semesters until you have met with them and discussed your classes. Plan your classes early. 8 o'clock classes are hard, but they leave you done by noon and with time to go to work and still be able to get work done for class., 214458=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 21414=Tuition, housing, and books is to much especially the housing and books. The apartment rooms are small and you pay 2097.00 for them per semester. The books are really high, and most cases you have to buy them brand new because NSU make a new edition every year., 91940=There are so many intramural and club sports. Crew is a club sport on our campus and it is the oldest club sport. We've been around since 1988. There are a large number of clubs and organizations that people can join., 160127=Natchitoches is such a fun little town that is quaint and lovely. The square offers a number of Cajun restaurants and opportunities to have fun with friends.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Small town, likes to relax, but dut do work when needed. Great for students who want to learn and enjoy their college experience. Tips for prospective students Make sure to get your housing and other forms in when necessary. This will help you to enjoy your time at NSU that much more! Bang for the buck The housing and meal plans are definitely worth it based on what you pay. I live in an apartment style dorm and only pay low-end dorm prices. Am enjoying being here I love the time I spend at NSU. It's nice to be able to go to class for a few hours, then be able to enjoy time with friends doing things like going to the recreation center, amd participating in many different organizations. The city is also very historic, and there is much to do. Am learning a lot I am definitely learning a lot at Northwestern State. The teachers are good, and if you are willing to put in a little effort, you can succeed. Login to rate or flag",
