            "GET INVOLVED in something right away Freshmen year! Service Plunge is the best way to make friends when you come in to school. Before the end of the first week, everyone will have their cliques and if you don't find a group right away, you're out of luck. I also wouldn't bother trying to be an RA; though the money is tempting and so is the job and the friendships, i's not worth it. The good applicants get screwed and they choose these party-goers that they think they can change into something better. Ha Ha their so funny; let's choose the drunkards and the sex maniacs who won't do their jobs and will quit on us by next year! Despite the terrible process, try to be friends with your RA; if nothing else, 9 times out of 10, they can get you drinks.",
            "If you wanted a large, chaotic and involved atmosphere, then you came to the wrong place. Salve is a small and isolated college on the outskirts of a tourist trap, but, hey, it is still pretty chaotic. Don't get me wrong, I love this school, but y'all are crazy; there are much better options."

    "textAfterTable": "Dorm Life A top reason to go to Salve would be the dorm life. The dorms and campus are extremely beautiful. Most dorms are in renovated mansions with beautiful views. Since freshman year, I've been able to have my own bathroom in my room. That was a big plus for me because the thought of community bathrooms scared me. Academic Rigor Depending on your major, classes can be extremely difficult. There are smaller class sizes and attendance usually counts for some grade points. With that being said, I have loved all of my teachers at Salve. Even though some of my classes were extremely difficult, that's what college is about. Tips for prospective students Salve is a great college if you would like to have closer relationships with teachers and classmates. You receive a unique learning experience because of how small the class sizes are. In three sentences Salve Regina is a very unique college. Newport is an amazing town and Salve has a beautiful campus. Any student should feel lucky to go here. Login to rate or flag the reviews Elna from Westbrook, CT",
