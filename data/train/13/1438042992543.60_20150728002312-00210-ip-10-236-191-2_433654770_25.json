    "textBeforeTable": "Looks like Pixar\u2019s run of hit films isn\u2019t stopping any time soon\u2026 While Cars might not have racked up the astounding early box office of Finding Nemo and The Incredibles, we doubt that the \u2018toon titan\u2019s chief John Lasseter will be too disappointed with a $62.8 million box office launch. It\u2019s true that this latest animated release faces a lot more competition than previous Pixar films \u2013 from the likes of Over The Hedge, which is already out and now at fifth place in this weekend\u2019s chart, and Monster House, which has scared up a 21 July release date. But given that all the previous Pixar movies have shown strong legs, Cars will likely have plenty of fuel left in its box office tank. The other big studio release, The Omen, got the jump on everyone else thanks to that 06/06/06 release date. Despite a healthy $12.5 million opening day, the momentum didn\u2019t quite hold and the devilish remake could only grab fourth place for the week, with $35.7 million ($15.4 million of that over the weekend). Still, it remains the biggest opener ever on\u2026 a Tuesday. (Insert your own crickets sound effect here). Finally, proving that smaller movies with a more limited, but devoted niche can open well, Robert Altman\u2019s latest \u2013 A Prairie Home Companion \u2013 took in $4.6 million, despite only opening on 760 screens.
