The first word contains the command data and the second word contains immediate values for the data registers (i.e. bit2 is applied to DR2, bit3 to DR3 . . . , bit31 to DR31). Any of the data registers can be moved to/from on-board memory. Each 1 bit in the immediate value enables the corresponding data register to be loaded or stored. Each Data register that has a corresponding 0 bit is ignored. The data in on-board memory is packed/compressed. (For example, if the immediate value has only two 1 bits corresponding to DR3 and DR10 and the on-board memory address is 1000 in a store operation, then DR3 is stored in on-board memory in word 1000 and DR10 is stored in 1001.)}",
