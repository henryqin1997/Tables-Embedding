            "Food is AWESOME! They have PAPA JOHNS on campus,Starbucks and so many more wonderful food places.",
            "The Dorms are GORGEOUS well the suites at least. Edinboro did wonderful with the lay out of the Suites. Some suites even receive full size beds, that's a bigger plus!",
            "I am 20 years old an going to Edinboro as a freshman. DOn't rush into college to please your family. Do it for you, no matter how long it takes just do whatever makes your happy",
            "Edinboro is a AMAZING school, the campus is flawless besides the fact that they all aren't suite style dorms. I'm attending Edinboro for Social Work, now get this they have a 1 year masters program. All you have to do is receive your bachelors maintaining a 3.0 and you will be able to receive your Masters. That's wonderful!"
