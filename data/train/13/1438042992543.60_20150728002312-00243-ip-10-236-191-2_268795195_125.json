In order to give a better idea of how all the pieces fit together we have, via an application called XML Spy, generated a series of diagrams. To begin, find the element or group name in the columns below. Click on it and it will take you to the appropriate diagram. You can also navigate by clicking on certain elements in the diagrams as well. If you would like to see other views of XSEM documentation here are some other links in this document set. To learn more about how XSEM is in DTD notation go to the XSEM DTD page. To see examples of how markup is applied to various XSEM elements go to the Main XSEM documentation page. As XSEM is an XML Schema you may wish to see documentation in a format that closer represents its internal structure. For this go to the XSEM Schema Documentation page.
