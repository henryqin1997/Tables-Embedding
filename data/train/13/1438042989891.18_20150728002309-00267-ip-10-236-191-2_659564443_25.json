            "I want to make a request for prayer for a good friend of mine D'Andre Manley whom I have been witnessing to since beginning of the year. He said he almost accepted Christ during the invitation but got so nervous at his church yesterday. Please pray that he accepts Christ and does not shrink back in fear.",
            "Derrick had the interview today and it went really well. Please pray for Derrick to continue to move forward in the interview process, get this job and then continue to establish a very successful career in law enforcement. My heart feels very heavy today. Derrick and I both long that I stay at home to take care of the home, that we can have another child and that he is in a place to financial care for us. The fact that I know that Derrick is longing for this makes my heart ache so much more. Lord we know that you will grace our family with the opportunity to accomplish the same.",
