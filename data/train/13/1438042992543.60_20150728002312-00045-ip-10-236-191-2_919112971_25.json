            "I feel very safe on campus. If you ever do not feel safe the Pueblo Sheriffs Department has their headquarters on campus. There are emergency centers around campus that you can push a button and someone will be right there and you can call a number to be escorted to you car.",
            "We have two sororities and two fraternities. I was in the Alpha Sigma Alpha for a little while and loved it but decided to focus on school.",
            "CSU-Pueblo has great Clubs and Activities. I am in the Medical Science Society, the President's Leadership Program, and Alpha Lambda Delta. There really is something for everyone and you can start your own club if you want something new.",
            "CSU-Pueblo is good for any type of student. They have so much to offer. Everyone should be able to find their own crowd to fit in.",
            "During Freshman orientation every one runs to the fountain and makes a wish with a CSU-Pueblo wooden quarter. They also have a foam party every year.",
            "At CSU-Pueblo you get a wonderful education for a very low tuition. I have had so many opportunities due to what a small university it is that I would not have had anywhere else.",
            "Their are so many clubs and athletics people can get involved. There is something to go to every night of the week. As long as you look at The T-wolf Howl (located on the bathroom doors) you will know what's going on.",
            "I don't eat in the cafeteria that often but their food is not that bad. The Starbucks coffee cart in the Life Science Building is awesome! Also I here the Cantina and the coffee shop in the library are really nice too.",
            "I don't live in the dorms but I have been in them and have not been impressed. I also have friends that hate living in the dorms. It really depends which dorm you are in though...do NOT get Belmont.",
            "My program, biology, strives to provide academic rigor but I can't attest to other programs. I definitely have to study more than I did in high school but I am still doing well.",
            "Just be yourself. I was automatically accepted due to my grades and ACT score but don't get discouraged if you are not. Once you are accepted and attend here, don't be afraid to approach other students or staff, everyone is very helpful.",
            "I absolutely love CSU-Pueblo! The opportunities provided to the students by the staff and extra curricular activities are astounding. I am so happy I chose to attend CSU-Pueblo!"

I will attend CSU-Pueblo in the fall of 2014., 155637=I lived in the dorm the summer of 2011 and it was really fun to get to meet new people you might have the same classes with but since my parents lived here I decided not to live there anymore because it was too expensive., 295022=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 274843=A new tradition is the 33 things to do before you graduate list. It is a campus wide list based on open student ideas and then a survey to choose the top 33 thins to be put on the Bucket List; 33 was the chosen number because CSU - Pueblo was established in 1933. A location would definitely be the spirit rock which is actually miles from the actual campus is the prairie behind the school., 106324=The food is really expensive. Last semester is was a $1.79 for bottle of water. You can get a bottle of water for $1-1.25 most places. $5 at one of the carts or dining places on campus is typically just enough to get you a container of fruit and maybe a drink. Coffee typically is at least $3. Compared to outside sources of food, I give this a low rating., 170217=The diverse campus at CSU-Pueblo is what makes this school unique. I am a recent veteran and they have been extremely helpful, so military friendly indeed. The cost is something that I can afford near-by school were in excess of 10,000 to live on campus per semester vs CSU-Pueblo at 2960., 131849=Our band is very entertaining, our football team made it to the NCAA D-2 championships during the 2011 season, the drama and art department is also excellent and well known throughout our town., 70596=Food isn't that great and a little expensive but the kitchen is being renovated so it should improve by 2013.}",
