Individual-level food security items for adults and children were added to NHANES in 2000, and added for adolescents in 2005. The NHANES Food Security section (FSQ) also provides data on food assistance., 6019=Most NHANES survey questions that assess a specific aspect of food security are identical or very similar for adults, teens, and children. In this 2005-2006 FSQ release, data collected separately for different age groups are combined and released as one variable for each topic, although the actual survey instruments may be slightly different by participants\u2019 ages. The exact wording of the FSQ questionnaires used in the survey can be found through the \u201cQuestionnaire\u201d link accompanying this release., 10294=1. Food stamp authorization: Household and individual-level food stamp data were collected for all household members during the household interview. One adult usually responded for the entire household. NCHS created a variable for the number of people in the HH who received food stamp benefits. New in 2005-06, the respondent was asked the dollar amount of the most recent food stamp benefit. The household level variables for \u201cbenefit amount\u201d and \u201cnumber of all people in the household who were authorized for food stamps\u201d are released on all household participants\u2019 records., 4742=The most recent NHANES Analytic Guidelines (September 2006) are available at the NHANES website6., 11893=In the household interview, an adult responded to the US FSSM questions. There are 18 items for households with children under age 18 and 10 items for households without children. Questions refer to all household members, not just NHANES participants. All households were administered these questions in 2005-2006; no income screen was used. Three categorical household-level variables were created: household, adult, and child food security, as described by USDA5. Responses to the 10 or 18 US FSSM items and the categorical data derived from these responses are released on each household participant\u2019s record., 13803=Title: Food Security (FSQ_D ) Contact Number: 1-866-441-NCHS Years of Content: 2005 - 2006 First Published: January, 2008 Revised: NA Access Constraints: None Use Constraints: None Geographic Coverage: National Subject:The food security section provides data on household and individual level food security, food stamp benefits, and participation in the WIC program.

In the 1980-90\u2019s, qualitative and survey research were undertaken to characterize food security, and survey modules were developed to assess it 1-4., 10662=Individual-level questions are derived from a subset of the household-referenced questions. Release of adolescent individual-level food security data is new for 2005-2006. The same variable labels are used for all age groups. These data are released only on the individual participant\u2019s record.}",
