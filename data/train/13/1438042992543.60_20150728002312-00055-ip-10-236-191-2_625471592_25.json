            "Description",
            "These data were collected using the CHARTS system. It is owned by the Naval Oceanographic Office and operated through contract. The system collects topographic lidar data at 9 kHz, bathymetric lidar data at 1 kHz and RGB imagery at 1Hz. A CASI-1500 hyperspectral line scanner is integrated with the system as well. Aircraft position, velocity and acceleration information are collected through a combination of Novatel and POS A/V 410 equipment. All raw data streams are transferred to the office for downloading and processing in SHOALS GCS software. Aircraft position data are processed using POSPac software and the results are combined with the lidar data to produce 3-D positions for each lidar shot. Upon inspection and QA/QC in the software packages Fledermaus and PFM_ABE, anomalous data are flagged as invalid. PFM_ABE's chartsLAS module then converts all valid data from ellipsoid to orthometric heights based on the NGS' GEOID03 model and exports topographic data as a series of LAS files with a single file per flightline per 5 km box and the bathymetric data files contain all of the returns from the bathymetric sensor which includes returns both above and below the water.",
            "The NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) received the topo files in LAS v1.1 format and the hydro files in ascii format. The files contained lidar elevation and intensity measurements. The topo data were classified as 0 (never classified) and received in geographic coordinates (NAD83) and vertically referenced to NAVD88 using the Geoid03 model. The vertical units of the data were meters. The hydro files were unclassified and received in geographic coordinates (NAD83) and vertically referenced to NAVD88. CSC performed the following processing for data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes: 1. Both topo and hydro files were filtered for elevation outliers. 2. The topo las files were converted from orthometric (NAVD88) heights to ellipsoidal heights using Geoid03. 3. The hydro ascii files were converted from orthometric (NAVD88) heights to ellipsoidal heights using Geoid03. 4. The hydro ascii files were converted from ascii format to las format and the points were reclassified from 0 to 11 (Bathymetry). 5. The data were converted to LAZ format.",
            "The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) received lidar data files via ftp transfer from the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The data are currently being served via NOAA CSC Digital Coast at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. The data can be used to re-populate the system. The data are archived in LAS or LAZ format. The LAS format is an industry standard for LiDAR data developed by the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS); LAZ is a loseless compressed version of LAS developed by Martin Isenburg (http://www.laszip.org/). The data are exclusively in geographic coordinates (either NAD83 or ITRF94). The data are referenced vertically to the ellipsoid (either GRS80 or ITRF94), allowing for the ability to apply the most up to date geoid model when transforming to orthometric heights."
