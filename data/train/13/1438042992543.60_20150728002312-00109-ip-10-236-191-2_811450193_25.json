    "textBeforeTable": "Some of the additional features of rsync are: The rsync remote-update protocol allows rsync to transfer just the differences between two sets of files across the network connection, using an efficient checksum-search algorithm described in the technical report that accompanies this package. rsync is a program that behaves in much the same way that rcp does, but has many more options and uses the rsync remote-update protocol to greatly speed up file transfers when the destination file is being updated.

    "textAfterTable": "support for anonymous or authenticated rsync daemons (ideal for mirroring) GENERAL Rsync copies files either to or from a remote host, or locally on the current host (it does not support copying files between two remote hosts). There are two different ways for rsync to contact a remote system: using a remote-shell program as the transport (such as ssh or rsh) or contacting an rsync daemon directly via TCP. The remote-shell transport is used whenever the source or destination path contains a single colon (:) separator after a host specification. Contacting an rsync daemon directly happens when the source or destination path contains a double colon (::) separator after a host specification, OR when an rsync:// URL is specified (see also the \"USING RSYNC-DAEMON FEATURES VIA A REMOTE-SHELL CONNECTION\" section for an exception to this latter rule). As a special case, if a single source arg is specified without a destination, the files are listed in an output format similar to \"ls -l\". As expected, if neither the source or destination path specify a remote host, the copy occurs locally (see also the --list-only option). SETUP See the file README for installation instructions. Once installed, you can use rsync to any machine that you can access via a remote shell (as well as some that you can access using the rsync daemon-mode protocol). For remote",
