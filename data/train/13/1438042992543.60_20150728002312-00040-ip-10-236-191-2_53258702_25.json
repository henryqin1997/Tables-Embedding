Chicago is the first team in the NFL to wrap up its division., 78207=Chicago then forced a three-and-out, but incurred consecutive 10-yard penalties to face a 1st-and-30. Cutler, though, tossed it down the right sideline for Knox, who came down with the ball near the 30 and reached the end zone untouched. The 67-yard play gave the Bears a 10-7 lead with 1:55 to play in the first., 76165=The first outdoor game in Minnesota since December 20, 1981 happened because the Metrodome is still undergoing repairs after the roof collapsed last week due to a heavy snowstorm.}",
