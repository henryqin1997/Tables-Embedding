            "The flightline LAS files are imported into GeoCue [V2012], which is a geospatial workflow production and management software tool employed by JALBTCX to perform and monitor production of data products. Upon import into GeoCue, the flightline LAS files are divided into a series of boxes, each of which are 1500 meters in length and width. A customized classification macro, built upon the TerraScan [V12] module within Microstation V8i, classifies valid topographic data as ground points (2) and unclassified points (1). Upon completion the macro, the classification results undergo quality control and any misclassified points are manually edited. In areas of dense vegetation the bare earth ground points might be incorrectly classified due to the inability of the laser to penetrate the canopy and reach the bare ground. In these areas, JALBTCX defaults to the algorithms ground surface instead of manually reclassifying those points. The final classification results are comprised of individual lidar points with classifications of ground (2) or unclassified (1). They are partitioned into a series of USGS quarter quad delivery boxes, one Classified LAS file per box. The format of the file is LAS version [1.2]. Data are classified as 1 (valid non-ground topographic data), 2 (valid ground topographic data).",
            "These data were collected using the CZMIL system. It is owned and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The system collects lidar data at 10 kHz and RGB imagery at 2 Hz. A CASI-1500 hyperspectral line scanner is integrated with the system as well. Aircraft position, velocity and acceleration information are collected through a combination of Novatel and POS A/V 510 equipment. All raw data streams are transferred to the office for downloading and processing in CZMILs Hydro Fusion software. Aircraft position data are processed using POSPac software and the results are combined with the lidar data to produce 3-D positions for each lidar shot. Upon inspection and QA/QC in the software packages Fledermaus and PFM_ABE, anomalous data are flagged as invalid. NOAAs VDatum software then converts all valid data from ellipsoid to orthometric heights based on the NGS' GEOID12A model and exports valid lidar data as a series of unclassified ascii xyz files.",
            "The NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) received the files in LAS v1.2 format. The files contained lidar elevation and intensity measurements. The data were received in geographic coordinates (NAD83) and vertically referenced to NAVD88 using the Geoid12A model. The vertical units were meters. The data were classified according to ASPRS LAS classification scheme (1 = unclassified, 2 = ground). CSC performed the following processing for data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes: 1. The las files were converted from orthometric (NAVD88) heights to ellipsoidal heights using Geoid12A.",
            "The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) received lidar data files via ftp transfer from the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The data are currently being served via NOAA CSC Digital Coast at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. The data can be used to re-populate the system. The data are archived in LAS or LAZ format. The LAS format is an industry standard for LiDAR data developed by the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS); LAZ is a loseless compressed version of LAS developed by Martin Isenburg (http://www.laszip.org/). The data are exclusively in geographic coordinates (either NAD83 or ITRF94). The data are referenced vertically to the ellipsoid (either GRS80 or ITRF94), allowing for the ability to apply the most up to date geoid model when transforming to orthometric heights."
