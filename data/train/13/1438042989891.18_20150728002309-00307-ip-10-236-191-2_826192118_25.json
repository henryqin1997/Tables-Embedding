The image should also have a maximum size of 2048 x 2048 pixels. If larger sized images are required, then WTML data files should be set up to tile the image correctly (refer to the WorldWide Telescope Data Tools Guide)., 67401=The following table lists the constellation codes and the center of each constellation. If a correct code is entered in a WTML file, such as Constellation=\"CET\", then there can be an improvement in the systems performance. If Constellation is left blank, or is wrong, then the RA and Dec entries are used. There are 89 entries in the table, as the discontiguous Serpens constellation is treated as two., 53113=There are two single URL based controls, Goto and ShowImage that enable the sharing of views by simply providing recipients with the URL. Goto is the simpler of the two, and enables a link to a particular point in space (RA, Dec and Zoom) to be captured, and then sent, for example, by email. ShowImage is similar, but includes more information (including a link to an image) that enables the sharing of that single image, without the need to write a WTML data file or create a community. If a valid data file does exist, a command line parameter can be used to initiate the Windows Client version., 12148=Study images are stored in image pyramids. Given an W x H pixel study, it is represented as an N x N pixel image where N is the smallest power of 2 that is at least as big as W and H. In mathematical terms, N = 2^ceiling(log_2(max(W,H))). In simpler terms, if a study image is 958 by 768 pixels, it will be embedded in a 1024 x 1024 square bitmap. The extra area not covered by the W x H photograph is occupied by transparent pixels. This forms the lowest level of the pyramid, with each level up containing a lower-resolution version of the original image with half the height and half the width of the image at the previous level. At each level, the image is further divided up into 256 x 256 tiles., 12859=The process of dividing up an image into this pyramid of tiles can be done using the Study Chopper tool. This tool not only creates the correct tiles, but places them in the required directory structure, and outputs sample WTML files to load them into WorldWide Telescope. The Study Chopper tool is included with the WorldWide Telescope May 2009 ADK.}",

This should be 176 wide by 45 pixels in height. Sample community thumbnail. See Also Setting up a Community Step 3: Create a Payload File The payload file contains the main content for a community. This file determines the folder structure, images, tours, community metadata, and so on. In its simplest form, a payload file can be a static WTML file that is hand-edited on the server side. Alternatively it can be generated from a database, and so might be much easier to update regularly. Typically payload files contain the following: Tours Study Images Surveys Panoramas Places: lists of locations (Place entries without an ImageSet) Catalogs Constellation figures (files with the WWTFIG extension) Links to articles or the organization\u2019s website Links to Blog entries, forums, conversation threads, discussion boards A sample community payload file",
