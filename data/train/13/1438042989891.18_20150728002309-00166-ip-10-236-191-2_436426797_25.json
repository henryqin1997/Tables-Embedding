            "IDENTIFICATION CONTROL METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR VALUABLE DOCUMENT - An identification control method and system for a valuable document. The system comprises a collection part, an identification part, a control part, a transmission part and an upper computer. In the identification part, complete identification information about a valuable document is split into basic identification information and high-grade identification information. Only the basic identification information which is required by the control part is sent to the control part, and the information which is not required by the control part is directly sent to the upper computer by the identification part. The identification part only transmits the basic identification information to the control part, the data transmission amount is one-tenth of the original data transmission amount, and the transmission speed can be increased by 10 times, thereby solving the problem that a valuable document cannot be quickly processed continuously because the serial transmission speed between the control part and the identification part is slow.",
            "FAST STORAGE METHOD FOR IMAGE DATA, VALUABLE-FILE IDENTIFYING METHOD AND IDENTIFYING DEVICE THEREOF - Disclosed are a valuable-file identifying method and an identifying device thereof. The identifying method and the identifying device store image data of a valuable file using a fast storage method for image data. The fast storage method for image data comprises: compulsively converting collected single-byte image data into long-integer image data; using N data masks which correspond to each other through a \u201cbitwise AND\u201d operation to extract the long-integer image data in such a manner that N points are extracted from M*N points in each line and one point is extracted from L points in each column, where N is an integer greater than or equal to 2, L and M are all integers greater than or equal to 1; and integrating the data extracted respectively by N data masks through a \u201cbitwise OR\u201d operation to obtain coded image data and store same. In conclusion, the present invention converts single-byte image data into long-integer image data, and extracts multipoint data at one time using a plurality of data masks which correspond to each other, reducing the number of operations, and achieving fast, compressed storage of images."

The transparent conductive film is fabricated by Ni/ITO, Al/ITO or NiO/ITO. In one embodiment, the thickness of the Ni layer is 5 \u212b to 30 \u212b. The thickness of the Al layer is 5 \u212b to 30 \u212b. The thickness of the NiO layer is 5 \u212b to 40 \u212b. The thickness of the ITO layer is 1000 \u212b to 3000 \u212b. In one embodiment, the fabricating method comprises steps of evaporating one of Ni, Al and NiO layers on a P-type GaN layer, heat-treating a wafer on which the Ni or Al layer is evaporated, then evaporating an ITO layer on the surface of Ni, Al or NiO layer, and heat-treating the wafer on which Ni/ITO, Al/ITO or NiO/ITO layers are evaporated. The transparent conductive film can have high light transmittance within the range of visible light and low specific contact resistance. 20090065795 03-05-2009 SET OF OHMIC CONTACT ELECTRODES ON BOTH P-TYPE AND N-TYPE LAYERS FOR GAN-BASED LED AND METHOD FOR FABRICATING THE SAME - The present disclosure relates to set of a ohmic contact electrodes on both P-type and N-type layers of a GaN-based light emitting diode (LED) and a fabricating method thereof.
