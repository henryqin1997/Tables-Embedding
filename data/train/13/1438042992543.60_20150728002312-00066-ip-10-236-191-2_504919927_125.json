Mallick 1 and Christine G. Elsik 2,* 1Department of Statistics, Texas A&M University College Station, TX 77843-3143, USA 2Department of Animal Science and Intercollegiate Faculty of Genetics, Texas A&M University College Station, TX 77843-2471, USA Motivation: Our aim was to predict protein interdomain linker regions using sequence alone, without requiring known homology. Identifying linker regions will delineate domain boundaries, and can be used to computationally dissect proteins into domains prior to clustering them into families. We developed a hidden Markov model of linker/non-linker sequence regions using a linker index derived from amino acid propensity. We employed an efficient Bayesian estimation of the model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Gibbs sampling in particular, to simulate parameters from the posteriors. Our model recognizes sequence data to be continuous rather than categorical, and generates a probabilistic output. Results: We applied our method to a dataset of protein sequences in which domains and interdomain linkers had been delineated using the Pfam-A database. The prediction results are superior to a simpler method that also uses linker index.

However, there are significant challenges for genome comparison. The challenge includes requirement for computational resources owing to the large volume of genome data. More importantly, since the choice of genomes to be compared is entirely subjective, there are too many choices for genome comparison. For these reasons, there is pressing need for bioinformatics systems for comparing multiple genomes where users can choose genomes to be compared freely. Results: PLATCOM (Platform for Computational Comparative Genomics) is an integrated system for the comparative analysis of multiple genomes. The system is built on several public databases and a suite of genome analysis applications are provided as exemplary genome data mining tools over these internal databases. Researchers are able to visually investigate genomic sequence similarities, conserved gene neighborhoods, conserved metabolic pathways and putative gene fusion events among a set of selected multiple genomes.

Full process of array-CGH data analysis, from normalization of raw data to the final visualization of copy number gain or loss, can be straightforwardly achieved on this arrayCyGHt system without the use of any further software. ArrayCyGHt, therefore, provides an easy and fast tool for the analysis of copy number aberrations in any kinds of data format.

Lee 1,2 and Doheon Lee 1,* 1Department of BioSystems and Advanced Information Technology Research Center, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology 373?1 Guseong-dong, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 305?701, Korea 2Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology 373?1 Guseong-dong, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 305?701, Korea Motivation: Clustering has been used as a popular technique for finding groups of genes that show similar expression patterns under multiple experimental conditions. Many clustering methods have been proposed for clustering gene-expression data, including the hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering and self-organizing map (SOM). However, the conventional methods are limited to identify different shapes of clusters because they use a fixed distance norm when calculating the distance between genes. The fixed distance norm imposes a fixed geometrical shape on the clusters regardless of the actual data distribution. Thus, different distance norms are required for handling the different shapes of clusters. Results: We present the Gustafson?Kessel (GK) clustering method for microarray gene-expression data. To detect clusters of different shapes in a dataset, we use an adaptive distance norm that is calculated by a fuzzy covariance matrix (F) of each cluster in which the eigenstructure of F is used as an indicator of the shape of the cluster. Moreover, the GK method is less prone to falling into local minima than the k-means and SOM because it makes decisions through the use of membership degrees of a gene to clusters. The algorithmic procedure is accomplished by the alternating optimization technique, which iteratively improves a sequence of sets of clusters until no further improvement is possible. To test the performance of the GK method, we applied the GK method and well-known conventional methods to three recently published yeast datasets, and compared the performance of each method using the Saccharomyces Genome Database annotations. The clustering results of the GK method are more significantly relevant to the biological annotations than those of the other methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for clustering gene-expression data.

It calculates the Euclidean distance to determine interactions between possible pairs of structural domains in proteins. PSIbase is a database and file server for protein structural interaction information calculated by the PSIMAP algorithm. PSIbase also provides an easy-to-use protein domain assignment module, interaction navigation and visual tools.
