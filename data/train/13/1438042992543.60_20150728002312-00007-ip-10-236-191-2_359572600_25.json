She was Initially HMS Swiftsure, she was a 74-gun ship of the line of the Royal Navy, built at Deptford in 1787 under plans by engineer Wells. She was captured by the French ships Indivisible and Dix-Ao\u00fbt in the Mediterranean on the 24 June 1801. She fought on the French side at the Battle of Trafalgar, where she was re-captured by the British, on the 21 October 1805. She was recommissioned in the Royal Navy as HMS Irresistible, since another British Swiftsure had been built since, and was used as a prison ship. She was scrapped in Chatham in 1816., 22003=Neal (July 2015), 62906=Died 21 October 1805, 22579=In December 1758, the commissioner of Chatham Dockyard was instructed to prepare a dry dock for the construction of a new 106-gun first-rate ship. This was an unusual occurrence at the time; during the whole of the 18th century only ten were constructed\u0097the Royal Navy preferred smaller and more manoeuvrable ships and it was unusual for more than two to be in commission simultaneously., 15310=Pooley Isaac ADM 29/31 p380 Victory aged 21; 21 June 1803-15 Jan 1806 Ord Ocean 16 jan 1806-17 Jan 1806 Ord Fame 18 Jan 1806-?

Going through muster rolls, I find a lot of references to an older Isaac Pooley who was a gunner in the Royal Navy and was 36 in 1799. I am certain this is Isaac Pooley (3) . This Isaac Pooley (3) pay book also states that he has a wife called Susan. I cannot find any reference to an Isaac Pooley at the battle of the Nile and I have been through every muster roll of every ship that was there. (The only reference I can find to that is newspaper clippings at the time of his death, but I am wondering of that has become distorted in time.) However, I do know that Isaac Pooley (1) served in the battle of Martinique in 30th Jan to 24th Feb1809 whilst aboard Acasta and the Invasion of Java Aug to Sep 1811 whilst on board the Scipion. Isaac Pooley (1) and (3) were both on board HMS Blonde albeit for a very very short time as Isaac Pooley (1) was taken away to HMS Kent by order of Sir Richard Bickerton , Baronet (attached a snip of that from HMS Blonde)., 64330=Neptune served as the flagship for Rear Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane leading the fleet that captured the French colony of Martinique in the West Indies in 1809., 23304=The keel was laid on 23 July 1759 in the Old Single Dock (since renamed No. 2 Dock and now Victory Dock), and the name was finally chosen in October 1760. It was to commemorate the Annus Mirabilis or Year of Victories, of 1759. In that year of the Seven Years' War, land victories had been won at Quebec, Minden and naval battles had been won at Lagos and Quiberon Bay. There were some doubts whether this was a suitable name since the previous first-rate Victory had been lost with all on board in 1744., 56071=Dreadnought continued to patrol the Channel and the Baltic for another seven years, until 1812, when she was taken out of commission at Portsmouth. In 1827, she became a lazaretto (quarantine ship) at Milford on Sea and became the second of the ships used by the Seamen's Hospital Society, between 1831 to 1857, as a hospital ship for ex-members of the Merchant navy or fishing fleet, and their dependants. HMS Dreadnought was broken up in 1857 with the infirmary transferring to the Caledonia, which was renamed Dreadnought. In 1870 the infirmary transferred onto land as the Seamen's Dreadnought Hospital at the Royal Greenwich Hospital, and since 1986 as the 'Dreadnought Unit' at St Thomas's Hospital. In addition, the Seamen's Dreadnought Hospital provided in 1919 the foundation for the UK's dedicated Hospital for Tropical Diseases., 16266=28 September 1803 to 24 December 1805 (Was at Trafalgar), 27496=17 July 1809 to 12 August 1809, 90315=Temeraire served as a prison ship from 1812\u00961815 and as a receiving ship until 1836 when she was briefly recommissioned. She was broken up in 1838, and some of her timbers were used to build a communion table and two bishop's chairs in St. Mary's Church, Rotherhithe., 44713='Ben Snood' was in fact Benjamin Clover SNOOD. He was born 23rd December 1777 & baptised 11th Jan 1778 at St Mary the Virgin, Wivenhoe, the son of William SNOOD, a Master Mariner & Boat Builder of Wivenhoe, and Ruth nee Clover., 29166=25 May 1803 to 27 January 1806 (Was at Trafalgar), 18981=In the 1871 census he was living in Park Lane (later New Park Street and between Victor Road and Port Lane) with his 35 year old daughter Elizabeth, an annuitant. He was shown as a widower, aged 86 years, a pensioner, deaf from the noise of cannon., 75577=On 15 October 1799 Naiad sighted two Spanish frigates, the Santa Brigada and Thetis, which were returning from Mexico to Spain with gold worth \u00a3600,000. She gave chase with two other British frigates, HMS Ethalian and HMS Almene. Ethalian caught and captured the Thetis, whilst Naiad and Almene captured the Santa Brigada., 26698=11 May 1803 to 15 January 1806 (Was at Trafalgar), 91820=The Phoebe was involved in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, commanded by Captain The Hon. Thomas Bladen Capel. She saw further service after Trafalgar, including in the Pacific and the War of 1812 against the United States. While operating in the Pacific against American ships, Phoebe, in company with the sloop-of-war Cherub, under the command of Captain James Hillyar who had orders to capture the USS Essex \"at all costs\", captured the 36-gun USS Essex in Valpara\u00edso on 28 March 1814., 40160=26 May 1805 to 16 December 1805 (Was at Trafalgar), 110011=30th August 2005, 73713=1 March 1805 to 16 November 1805 (Was at Trafalgar), 49069=HMS Minotaur was a 74-gun third-rate ship of the line launched in 1793 named for the mythological bull-headed monster of Crete., 10009=On October 21st 2006, a procession, including the Mayor of Colchester, Sea Cadets, the Town Watch and a standard bearer marched from the Town Hall to Trinity Church, with a service of commemoration to mark the Battle of Trafalgar and the part that our Colchester Heroes played at the Battle of Trafalgar., 46084=3rd Aug 1805 sailed from St Helena with a convoy. 25th Sept sighted the Rochefort squadron. 26th Sept captured by the Rochefort squadron., 37954=Comments: Lent HMS Gladiator 27 September-3 November 1800, 33903=On 21 October 1805, under the command of Captain Richard King, Achille was in Admiral Collingwood's column at the Battle of Trafalgar, seventh in the line, between Bellerophon and Polyphemus[citation needed]. Achille opened fire on the rear of the French and Spanish fleet at 12.15, engaging the Montanes, 74, for fifteen minutes, before sailing on to meet the Argontauta, 80, which had already been battling with other British ships. After hours of fierce fighting, Argonauta fell silent and closed her gunports, but before Achille could accept her surrender, her French namesake Achille, 74, moved in to engage the British ship. After exchanging broadsides, the French ship sailed on and was replaced on the starboard side by the Berwick, 74, and for the next hour and a quarter she lay close alongside Achille, receiving a pounding that eventually forced her to surrender with over 250 casualties - almost half her crew. Achille took possession, and transferred some of her crew back on board as prisoners. Achille suffered 13 killed and 59 wounded in the battle, in stark comparison to the heavy losses she inflicted on her French and Spanish adversaries., 88616=Revenge served until 1842, being broken up in 1849. She was one of the first warships of the Royal Navy to be painted with the Nelson Checker., 81032=The Agamemnon was a 3rd rate ship of the line,one of seven ships built to the same design, drawn by the same naval architect that designed the famous Victory, Sir Thomas Slade. Agamemnon was the third to be built in the class, the first two being Ardent in 1762 and Raisonnable, laid down in 1763. Third was Agamemnon, followed by Belliqueux in 1778, Stately in 1779, Indefatigable in 1781 and finally the Nassau in 1783., 89430=HMS Temeraire was a 98-gun second-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched in 1798 at Chatham, which fought at the Battle of Trafalgar. She was named after the French 74-gun ship taken at the Battle of Lagos (1759), following the British custom of naming new ships after old prizes., 57852=HMS Defiance was a 74 gun third-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, built in 1783 by Randall and Co., at Rotherhithe on the River Thames., 64536=She was the second of nine ships to bear the name Neptune. She was laid up in ordinary in 1810 and broken up 1818., 59982=7 October 1805, 18742=In the 1861 census he was living in Hythe Street with his 25 year old daughter Elizabeth, a school mistress. He was shown as a widower, aged 76 years, a retired shoemaker and Greenwich pensioner., 39318=5 September 1804 to 19 September 1804, 21423=[HMS Blonde sailed from ....

She is the oldest naval ship still in commission and the only remaining ship of the line except for the Regalskeppet Vasa. She sits in dry dock in Portsmouth as a museum ship., 76260=Served in many other actions in the Napoleonic Wars, and was finally paid off in 1826., 79392=The 1841 census shows Thomas and his wife Catherine living in Lion Walk. He was aged 69, with a profession of 'Royal Navy' and she is aged 53. Three Noone children and one servant were living with them. By 1851 he is shown again in Lion Walk, living with Catherine and his Noone niece and nephew. He is aged 78, a Captain R.N. on half pay, born in Cambridge. Catherine is shown as having been deaf and as being born in Colchester. Thomas' niece, Lucinda Noone, was recorded as an orphan., 83452=On 7th January 1793, Nelson learned from Lord Hood that he had been chosen to command his first ship of the line, the Agamemnon. Although initially disappointed that he had not been given command of a 74, Nelson soon grew fond of Agamemnon. Nelson wrote to his wife, Fanny. She was, he said, \"Without exception one of the finest ships in the fleet, with the character of sailing most remarkably well\". He also wrote after twelve days in a storm in the Mediterranean in \"Gales and lumping seas but in Agamemnon we mind them not; she is the finest ship I ever sailed in, and were she a 74, nothing should induce me to leave her while the war lasts\". Even a French Commander Admiral Alemand expressed the view that Agamemnon was one of the fastest ships in the British Navy. That, coupled with Nelson\u0092s inspirational command made her a very potent fighting unit., 51989=HMS Dreadnought was a 98 gun second-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy. She was launched at Portsmouth at midday on Saturday, 13 May 1801, after 13 years on the stocks. She was the first man of war launched since the Act of Union 1800 created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and at her head displayed a lion couchant on a scroll bearing the Royal arms as emblazoned on the Standard., 9565=was cleaned up in 2005., 40605=17 December 1805 to 7 July 1807, 32844=Died 17 June 1810, drowned in Cadiz harbour out of pinnance when returning from watering., 23852=Once the frame had been constructed it was normal to cover the ship up and leave it for several months to season. However, the end of the Seven Years' War meant that she remained in this condition for nearly three years, which helped her subsequent longevity. Work restarted in autumn 1763 and she was finally launched on 7 May 1765 having cost \u00a363,176 and 3 shillings (present day \u00a350 million) and used around 6000 trees, 90% of which were oak and the remainder elm, pine and fir., 41790=15 July 1809 to 9 January 1810, 81873=Tonnage - 1384 tons, 36232=There is a strong possibility that James Richardson died on 30 November 1868, aged 88, (death registered in Lambeth. Having deserted HMS Courageux, he is believed to have worked as a warehouseman and married Ann (Nancy) Watts in 1810. Together they had nine children.

She rolled on her side rapidly, where waves dismasted her and pounded her hull which began to split. Prior to the roll, 110 of her crew had taken to her boats and soon reached shore, where they informed the Dutch authorities of the disaster. The authorities however placed the survivors under custody and refused to dispatch any rescue vessels until the following morning. The rescue party found however that apart from four men who reached shore by clinging to wreckage, no survivors remained on the vessel or in the surrounding water, with the death toll being between 370 and 500[1]., 91351=She was launched in 1795 at Deptford on the Thames. During the initial stages of her career, Phoebe saw active service in the Mediterranean, capturing the French 36-gun Nereide in 1797. On 19 February 1801 she encountered the French 40-gun L'Africaine, which was intending to transport 400 troops as reinforcements for a French invasion force in Egypt. L'Africaine surrendered to the Phoebe after sustaining heavy casualties., 73989=HMS Ajax, launched in 1798, was a 74-gun third-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy.

He was shown as being aged 55, a cordwinder., 58038=Her crew mutinied three times, in October 1795 (then commanded by Captain Sir George Horne). HMS Calcutta, Captain William Bligh commanding, was ordered to embark 200 troops and take them alongside in order for the troops to board Defiance and regain control. The threat of the soldiers ended the mutiny. Defiance also mutinied in 1797 [1] and 1798 [2]., 74274=The Ajax was destroyed in an accidental fire while serving in the Dardanelles in 1807 as part of a squadron under Admiral Sir John Duckworth, 79223=who died October 18th 1858, 39899=24 April 1805 to 25 May 1805, 41524=2 July 1809 to 14 July 1809, 39627=20 September 1804 to 23 April 1805, 16079=13 August 1803 to 27 September 1803, 40876=8 July 1807 to 26 June 1809, 75949=In 1805 Naiad was part of the squadron of frigates that watched the French and Spanish fleets in Cadiz prior to the Battle of Trafalgar.

Benjamin was also a Mariner and died 27th October 1837, aged 59. His gravestone is in St Mary the Virgin church, Wivenhoe; he is named on this stone, along with his wife (who died in 1839) by his initials:, 38170=4 November 1800 to 31 November 1800, 30750=The first ship of the fleet in action at Trafalgar on October 21, 1805, she led one column of warships; Nelson's Victory led the other. Due to the re-coppering of her hull prior to her arrival off Cadiz Royal Sovereign was a considerably better sailer, in the light winds present that day, than other vessels, and pulled well ahead of the rest of the fleet. As she cut the enemy line alone and engaged the Spanish flagship Santa Ana, Nelson pointed to her and said, \"See how that noble fellow Collingwood carries his ship into action!\" At approximately the same moment, Collingwood remarked to his captain, \"What would Nelson give to be here?\", 66141=She was laid down and Sheerness in 1782 and was commissioned in 1799 under the command of Captain G. Lumsdaine. She sailed from Yarmouth on 9 August 1800 with a squadron under Vice Admiral Dickson in Monarch bound for Denmark. Because of lack of wind the faster sailing vessels had to tow the slower ones and it was 15 August before they reached the Skaw. The next day the whole squadron advanced as far as the mouth of the Sound where the Danes had anchored three 74-gun ships, later increased to four, between Cronberg Castle and the Swedish shore. Because of gales the Admiral sheltered his squadron in Elsinor Roads then went in Romney as far as Sophienburg to talk with Lord Whitworth who was negotiating with the Danish ministers. When matters were resolved the squadron returned to Yarmouth in September., 28803=16 July 1800 to 24 May 1803, 19273=In November 1797 an Isaac Pooley married Susannah Thompson in St Leonards Church in Colchester. What connection could there be with this mnarriage we wonder?, 96538=One of the most decisive battles in the history of the Royal Navy, Nelson's defeat of the French fleet took place on 21st October 1805 off Cape Trafalgar and was conducted with not a single British ship lost, although few ships escaped severe punishment. Loss of life on both sides was tragically high., 27138=17 January 1806 to 16 July 1809, 45869=The Calcutta, was a 4th Rate late Indiaman purchased 1795 & disposed of 26th Sept 1805, 16633=25 December 1805 to 15 January 1806, 88385=HMS Revenge, launched in 1805, was a third-rate of 74 guns.

From a book of monumental inscription transcriptions, held in the Colchester Library, and from the 1841 and 1851 censuses, we are able to confirm the following information. This contradicts the above record in that the gravestone states that he was born in Colsterworth (Lincolnshire) but that the 1851 census says he was born in Cambridge. So, what are we led to believe?, 70523=Captain Cumby was appointed to Hyperion in March 1811 and was succeeded by Captain T. Graves then Captain Douglas. Polyphemus paid off at Chatham in November 1812., 53710=Purvis served under the orders of Admiral Cornwallis until he was promoted to Rear Admiral in April 1804. The next commander until August was Robert Carthen Reynolds. He was superseded that month by George Reynolds, who, in turn, was replaced in December that year by Edward Rotheram, who stayed as flag captain to Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood until just before Trafalgar. The winter gale weather off the French coast badly damaged five of the major warships maintaining the blockade. Dreadnought lost most of her powder when water poured into the magazine., 82899=Agamemnon\u0092s maiden voyage was on 9th July 1781 under the command of Captain Caldwell. Her first engagement was at the battle of Ushant on 12th December 1781 where the British fleet under Rear Admiral Kempenfelt defeated the French fleet and captured a significant number of ships, including the convoy the French were escorting. Agamemnon\u0092s next major engagement was at the Battle of The Saints on 12th April 1782 where Rodney and Lord Hood\u0092s fleet defeated Comte de Grasse\u0092s French fleet., 78915=December 27th 1851, 43657=From 1811 she was in Portsmouth harbour, and in 1814 the decision was taken to have her broken up., 63762=HMS Neptune (1797 at Deptford) was a 98-gun 2nd rate ship of the line which fought at the Battle of Trafalgar. Commanded by Captain Thomas Fremantle, she played an important role in the battle, stationed third in the weather line, behind the flagship Victory and the Temeraire. After the battle, it was the Neptune that towed the crippled Victory, bearing Nelson's body, back to Gibraltar., 68796=In 1807 Polyphemus, under the command of Captain P. Heywood, became the flagship of Rear Admiral Murray, South America., 30014=HMS Royal Sovereign (1786) was a 100-gun 1st rate ship of the line which served as the flagship of Admiral Collingwood at the Battle of Trafalgar. She was the third of seven Royal Navy ships to bear this name. Designed by Sir John Williams, she was launched at Plymouth Dockyard September 11, 1786, at a cost of \u00a367,458. She was of 2193 tons burthen, with gundeck length 186' 0\" and breadth 52' 0\". She mounted 100 great guns on her 3 full gundecks, quarterdeck, and forecastle., 68959=In 1808, under the command of Captain W. Price Cumby (another Trafalgar veteran), she became the flagship of Vice Admiral B.S. Rowley. In July she sailed for Jamaica, convoying a large fleet of merchantmen, for the Vice Admiral to take up his appointment. Since he resided on shore with his flag in Shark, Polyphemus was able to undertake cruises against the enemy. On the morning of 14 November he detached his boats under Lieutenant Joseph Daly in the barge to chase a schooner attempting to enter the harbour at San Domingo. An hour later she was boarded and carried under a hail of grape and musketry in which marine Samuel Crompton was killed and proved to be the French national schooner Colibry of three carriage guns commanded by Lieutenant Deyrisse with 63 men., 85732=Agamemnon\u0092s next major fleet engagement was the battle of Copenhagen on the 21st April 1801. Unfortunately she was grounded on a shoal for most of the action, but Nelson won the battle and a truce with Denmark was negotiated. On the 21st October 1805 Agamemnon took part in the battle of Trafalgar. When Nelsons favorite ship hove in sight a week before, with Nelsons old friend Sir Edward Berry in command of the Agamemnon, Nelson was delighted \"Here comes that damned fool Berry! Now we shall have a battle.\", 84380=Nelson commanded Agamemnon, or \"eggs and bacon\" as her crew affectionately called her, until 10th June 1796. In that time Nelson had proved to be a great Commander, tactically and physically., 76390=Naiad was sent to serve as a depot ship, first to Valparaiso, Chile in 1846 and then to Callao, Peru from 1851 and 1898. Broken up in 1898 Naiad was the longest survivor of any of the British ships at Trafalgar apart from HMS Victory., 61347=The \u0093Defence,\u0094 commanded by Captain George Hope, took part in the battle of Trafalgar. The \u0093Defence,\u0094 as fourteenth ship of the lee column, was very late in getting into action. She first engaged the French \u0093Berwick\u0094 and then attacked the Spanish \u0093San Ildefonso, 148; which struck after an hour's action. The \u0093Defence\u0094 lost 7 killed and 29 wounded. On December 24th, 1811, after some minor services in the Baltic, the \u0093Defence,\u0094 commanded by Captain David Atkins, was wrecked and lost on the coast of Jutland, 593 men being lost out of 597., 42660=She was captured on 23 June 1795 at the Battle of Groix, near the French port of Lorient. She was taken into service in the Royal Navy, but because the Navy already had a Formidable, she was renamed Belleisle, apparently in the mistaken belief that she had been captured off Belle \u00cele, rather than the \u00cele de Groix., 78067=An inscription to Thomas and Elizabeth has been added onto the altar style tomb of Henry Topping MD, who died in 1819. The inscription reads:, 38616=13 December 1800 to 16 May 1803, 44307=Ben Snood served for two years in the Royal Navy. He was born in 1777 and died in Wivenhoe in 1837 at the age of 60 years.

She was armed with smooth bore, cast iron cannon 30 x 32 and 42 pounders (15 and 19 kg), 30 x 24 pounders (11 kg), and 40 x 12 pounders (5 kg). Later she also carried two carronade guns, firing 68 lb (31 kg) round shot., 90085=She became famous as the subject of two paintings by J. M. W. Turner, one showing her at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, the other showing her being towed to the breaker's yard in 1838., 67874=In July 1806 she was with Lord St. Vincent's squadron off Ushant and on 14 July her boats, together with others of the squadron, were taken by the Iris to Sir Samuel Hood in Indefatigable off Rochefort to attack two French corvettes and a convoy at the entrance to the Garonne. The weather on 15 July appeared suitable for the attempt but after the boats left a strong wind blew up and although they managed to capture the 18-gun brig Caesar they could not prevent the convoy escaping up river. The greater part of the boats were either shot through or so badly stove in that they were swamped, and had to be cut adrift from the brig as she was brought out under fire from the batteries and ex-British Teaser brig. The casualties from Polyphemus were William Anderson, Quarter Master's Mate, who was cut across the hand, and W. Fleming, Coxswain, who was cut across the eyebrow., 69773=In June 1809 Captain Cumby was appointed to command a squadron consisting of Polyphemus, Aurora, Tweed, Sparrow, Thrush, Griffin, Lark, Moselle, Fleur-de-Mer and Pike. They sailed from Port Royal on 7 June with troops under Major General Carmichael to assist the Spanish forces besieging the French in the city of San Domingo. On 1 July Polyphemus anchored at Caleta and loaded eight of her lower deck guns into the Sparrow sloop to be landed at Palenqui for the use of the batteries to the westward of the town. Two of the guns were then transported by Captain Burt of Sparrow from Andre Bay to the east battery, nearly 30 miles across almost impassable country. The French garrison surrendered on 6 July., 71943=Comments: DSQ 29 Jan 1807 Argonaut Hospital Ship, Chatham, 29720=29 March 1810, 84625=It was during his command of Agamemnon that Nelson lost the sight of his right eye. When at the Siege of Calvi in 1794 during the morning of 10th July, Nelson was hit in the face and chest by splinters, stones and sand that were thrown up by an enemy shell that hit a battlement during a shore action. On 13th June 1796, Nelson\u0092s broad pennant was transferred to the 74 gun Captain at anchor in San-Fiorenza bay. He watched the worn out Agamemnon sail to England for a much-needed refit. She was refitted from the bottom up at Chatham. When re-commissioned in 1797 she was ordered to join Admiral Duncan\u0092s squadron off Yarmouth, which was keeping watch on the coast of Holland. She was immediately caught up in the naval mutinies of that year. Agamemnon was however considered untrustworthy by Richard Parker the leader of the Nore mutineers and had the guns of the mutinous ships trained on her to ensure she did not \u0091blackleg\u0092. Subsequently in the proceedings that followed all thirteen of Agamemnon\u0092s crew who were tried were pardoned., 53510=In 1803, Captain Edward Brace briefly took command as Flag-Captain to William Cornwallis, until he was relieved that same year by Captain John Child Purvis., 17522=He left the Royal Navy in 1816 and returned to Colchester where he lived at the Hythe as a bootmaker. He married Elizabeth Winch in 1825 at St Leonards Church, Colchester and they had eight children. In the 1871 census he was shown as being, 'deaf from noise of cannons'. He died in 1872 at the age of 87 years and was buried in Colchester' Cemetery on Mersea Road., 86302=Later in Agamemnon\u0092s career, she served in the West Indies, taking part in the battle of Santo Domingo, and then in South American waters. Agamemnon was wrecked in Maldonado Bay off the coast of Uruguay on the 16th June 1809. Divers discovered the remains of HMS Agamemnon on the bottom of Maldonado Bay, after a six-year search by marine archaeologists. Strewn around the site are hundreds of copper plate, as well as a 24 pounder cannon, parts of the pumping devices as well as a significant amount of shot, bolts and copper nails. Also discovered was a silver pocket seal, complete with fob chain. On its face of translucent stone it bore a star shaped emblem with the name \u0091Nelson\u0092 in mirror image incised in a curve above., 54311=In the spring of 1805, Admiral Cornwallis was replaced by an ailing Lord Gardner who allowed the close blockade to be slackened. On 30 March the French fleet escaped from Toulon and reached C\u00e1diz on 9 April. The French and Spanish squadrons sailed separately from there and joined forces in Martinique on 26 May. On 15 May Collingwood and his squadron of seven ships received orders from the Admiralty to sail for Barbados. Before they could depart; however, Horatio Nelson arrived from the Mediterranean Sea in pursuit of the French, and Dreadnought proceeded to C\u00e1diz for Collingwood to command a close blockade there. Early in October 1805 Captain John Conn assumed command of Dreadnought, after having brought Royal Sovereign out from England for Vice Admiral Collingwood. Collingwood and Rotheram then moved to the newly recoppered first rate on the 10th of October 1805, leaving Conn in command of the now sluggish Dreadnought, with her barnacled hull badly in need of careening, but nevertheless with a well exercised ship's company, who for months having been under Collingwoods watchful eye, now contained the most efficient gun crews in the fleet., 93649=We are hoping to find out a little of the lives of each of those named, especially any descendants of those listed.

She was soon completely dismasted (the only British ship which suffered that fate), unable to man\u009cuvre and largely unable to fight, as her sails blinded her batteries, but kept flying her flag for 45 minutes until the British ships behind her in the column came to her rescue. With 33 dead and 93 wounded, she was then towed to Gibraltar after the battle by the frigate HMS Naiad., 95351=At 1.25p.m. Lord Nelson was mortally wounded while walking the \u0093Victory\u0092s\u0094 quarter-deck with his flag-captain, and by 3p.m. the firing had diminished. At 4.40p.m. Having learned of the completeness victory, the British Commander-in-Chief quietly and without a struggle ceased to breathe. By 5p.m. the fight was over, the fleet being 8 miles N.W. by W. of Trafalgar. The British lost 449 killed, which included Vice-Admiral Lord Nelson, 2 captains, and 34 officers; and 1241 wounded which included 106 officers. The British ships suffered severely in the hulls, and many were wholly or partially dismasted. The Franco-Spaniards lost 18 ships captured, of which 1 blew up. It appears that the enemy lost about 7000 killed and wounded, which included two admirals and seven captains killed. The remainder of the allied fleet managed to escape, and six months afterwards the French commander-in-Chief, Vice-Admiral Villeneuve, died at Rennes (it is said by his own hands), and was buried without military honours. Of the 17 prizes 2 sank, 6 were wrecked and lost in a storm after the battle, 2 were burned, and 1 was destroyed., 23015=The outline plans arrived in June 1759 and were based on HMS Royal George which had been launched at Woolwich Dockyard in 1756.

She was present at the landings in Aboukir Bay during the invasion of Egypt in 1801 where she lost four men, and was finally present at the Battle of Trafalgar under Captain Charles John Moore Mansfield, where she was instrumental in capturing the Spanish ship Neptuno. During her career, she also managed to capture the French frigate Franchise, as well as attack shipping outside Genoa, Algeciras and Fredricksham in Russia., 81497=Agamemnon was laid down at Bucklers Hard in May 1777 and launched on the 10th April 1781. Her dimensions were as follows;, 55526=At the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, Dreadnought was the eighth ship in the lee division to enter the action. She started firing on San Juan Nepomuceno at two o'clock and fifteen minutes later ran her on board and forced her to surrender after her valiant Spanish commander Commodore Cosme Damian de Churruca y Elorza had been killed in action. She then attempted to engage Principe de Asturias but the Spanish ship hauled off. During the battle Dreadnought lost seven killed and 26 wounded., 17983=His gravestone was re-discovered in Colchester's cemetery and restored in 2007 and is shown here. Some of his known descendants now live in Australia. The gravestone makes no mention of Isaac's naval career, so the 1807 record stating 'run' possibly suggests that he did not quit the navy in best circumstances., 17248=18 January 1806 to 28 June 1807, 77129=Born in Colsterworth, BAPTISED, ALL SAINTS, COLCHESTER. 4th Feb 1774 the son of Thomas and Mary Pinto, joined the ship aged 31 on 6th Jan 1805, promoted to lieutenant in 1805, DIED NOV. 1851, BURIED AT HOLY TRINITY, PCC\u00a0will PROB\u00a011/2146 proved 23rd Jan 1852 described as of Colchester and Captain RN.
