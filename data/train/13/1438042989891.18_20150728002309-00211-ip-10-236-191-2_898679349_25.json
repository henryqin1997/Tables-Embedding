Collge classes are more difficult & more time consuming than high school classes! Make sure you manage your time well, and once again, use your professors! If you're having trouble, ask for assistance., 128443=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 119328=I gave it 4/5 stars because it all really depends on your major and which classes you choose to take. Some classes are harder than others but it comes down to you yourself and your learning ability/ English 1108 has been my only extremely hard class so far the rest have been pretty normal., 90244=It depends on where you stay. Pence Hall is the athletic dorm. It contains mostly guys. Prichard Hall is for those students that participate in the Honors Program. Its the brainy dorm. I cannot really say anything about Morrow Hall except that it is the oldest dorm. Bryant is pretty nice. It is a suite-style place; yu have singles and doubles. You can have your own room. However, it is about $1000 more expensive than the other halls.}",

Car trouble? I'm sure they'll help. And in the very rare, off chance that you are being followed, attacked, or whatever, there are many emergency....towers? I guess that's what you'd call them. They kind of look like phone booths. They're yellow and they have an emergency button. There's like five around campus. Greek Life I'm not in a fraternity or sorority, but they are there. I've seen them. Clubs and Activities FSU has lots of sport teams, clubs, sororities, fraternities, whatever, you name it. There's a lot of activities too. In the Falcon Center, you can take spinning classes, yoga classes, zumba classes. Plays are constantly being put on. For some reason, ultimate Frisbee is really popular at FSU. There's always a bake sale or some informational booth set up. The activities are endless. Great for these types of students FSU is great for ALL types of students. That's the wonderful thing about college. In high school, there were cliques and whatnot, but college is different. Everyone gets along with everyone. Well, at",
