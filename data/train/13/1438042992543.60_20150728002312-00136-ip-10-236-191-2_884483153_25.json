Prior to 1854, the Assessors were located within the Treasury Department. Assessors, as well as, Assistant Assessors were chosen by concurrent vote of the City Council until 1885. In 1885, the power to appoint Assessors was transferred to the Mayor subject to confirmation by the Board of Aldermen.

Boston was the third place to start publishing directories (after New York and Philadelphia) in 1789. They were published annually (for the most part) after 1825. The directory evolved from a simple entry (ex. Herring Ebenezer, mason and sexton, Lynde-street) to one of name, occupation and location, residence (boarding or house), and would list you if you worked in the city but lived elsewhere (then it would name the town of residence). Added features were usually a map (often not digitized and missing), lists of a few trades (such as lawyer, physician, etc.), a few civic items (fire companies, justices, etc.), and business advertisements. More categories appeared over time. By the later 1800s, when someone was being dropped because they died, their death date would be given, or moved, their new town of residence was given. By 1930, there was a very helpful reverse directory added (arranged by street). This resource ceased publication in 1981. The years published are:, 715649=Chapter 354 of the Acts of 1853 authorized and empowered the City Council to consolidate the Watch and Police Departments into one department.

The appointment of teachers, however, still remained the prerogative of the School Committee. In 1876, the rules and regulations were revised and considerable nominal power was granted to the Superintendent and Supervisors, but the appointment of teachers was retained by the district subcommittees. The newly established Board of Supervisors became a board for the examination and certification of teachers. In 1884, the Superintendent was given additional powers.

Third Methodist Episcopal Church or Church Street Methodist Episcopal Church, 1834-1879., 100291=To understand the issues with the vital records for Boston, we need to understand its history. Massachusetts Bay enacted laws early on for the recording of vital events. The town of Boston dutifully recorded these events. From a study by Lemuel Shattuck using the baptismal records, he determined that the practice of civil recording of births saw a slow and steady decline since 1725 when the reported rate of was 3.3% (religious baptisms were near 5%) and down to 2.0% by 1845 (i.e. less than half of what should be expected). Turning to marriages, Shattuck found that the rate of marriages was relatively unchanged all the way up to 1845. He observed two gaps that should be noted. From 1663 to 1689, not one marriage was recorded in the civil records, and from 1751 to 1761 only a few marriages were found. Deaths were well recorded in the early years, but like the marriages, none appear from 1663 to 1689. A separate volume was used after this period and seem to be representative until 1719. But, from 1719 to 1810, few deaths were recorded. In 1810, recording was done by the Superintendent of Burials so then appear complete from then forward. Shattuck found that from 1704 to 1774, sextons made weekly returns to the newspapers for the number who died each week. In this period as the town grew, the annual average death toll rose from 334 to 521, so many thousands of deaths were not recorded. These gaps and issues should be kept in mind when using Boston vital records.

This department exercises all the powers and duties formerly conferred upon the Board of Registrars of Voters (including the preparation of the jury list), except the power and duty of giving notice of elections and fixing the days and hours for holding the same. The Board also exercises all the powers and duties formerly conferred upon the City Clerk and other officers by chapter 504 of the Acts of 1894. One Election Commissioner is appointed by the Mayor each year, term beginning on the 1st of April. The two leading political parties must be equally represented on the Board and the Chairman is designated annually by the Mayor., 710712=The origins of the Boston Fire Department date back to 1678 with the establishment of the first engine company and the receipt of the first hand fire engine in North America. The Board of Fire Wards was established on February 1, 1711. Prominent men were chosen as Fire Wards and were responsible for the operation and maintenance of the equipment assigned to their ward. Chapter 52 of the Acts of 1825, \"An Act Establishing a Fire Department in the City of Boston and an Ordinance for the preventing and extinguishing of fires and establishing a fire department\" went into full operation in April of 1826. With this legislation, the Board of Fire Wards was dissolved. All records and property belonging to the city were transferred to the Chief Engineer in May of 1826., 562243=58.

The Overseers of the Poor were having difficulty covering the whole town and proposed to divide the town into twelve wards. The freemen agreed and added that these wards would be the districts for \"military considerations,\" too. The division was given to the Overseers to create and the resulting report for such divisions was accepted by the freeman with the caveat that these boundaries would stay in force until the town decided to change them.[See A Report of the Record Commissioners of the City of Boston Containing the Boston Records from 1729 to 1742 (Boston, 1885) [i.e. v. 12], 127, 131-133.] The next change in the ward boundaries came in 1805.

During that year, after considerable agitation on the part of the citizens of the town, primary schools were established. The citizens created in town meeting a special committee distinct and separate from the regular School Committee to safeguard the interests of the primary schools. This committee had a membership ranging from 36 at one time to 196 at another time. The Primary School Committee continued to have exclusive control of the primary schools until 1855, when these schools were placed under the jurisdiction of the general committee., 126917=The Boston Almanac started publication in 1836 as a simple almanac of climate, astrological, farm, and other tables along with a calendar.

It was the largest town in British North America for the first hundred years. Because of that, the town and later city became a draw for immigrants from around the world. Though the first two hundred years saw mostly English arrivals, Scots, Irish, and French were found here, too. It was after 1820 that immigrants from other European countries started arriving in large numbers. The gate was opened by the Irish fleeing the potato famine in 1847. The next wave included more Irish (their dominance starting in the early 20th century is a testament to their number), but also Germans, Italians, and Syrians. The end of the century saw French Canadians, Russian and Polish Jews, and Swedes arriving. The 21st century brought African Americans from the South, Southeast Asian immigrants (especially Chinese and Vietnamese), Muslims, and Puerto Ricans. Many other ethnicities can be found in pockets all over Boston, and walking in downtown one will likely here many languages being spoken., 638745=This collection has no finding aid.

Since Boston covers a majority of Suffolk County, look for Suffolk County Atlases., 226526=Because of the annexation of Roxbury, a list of changes in names for street in Boston proper and Roxbury was given in 1868 to eliminate the confusion caused by the duplication of names [see Municipal Records, Vol. 46, pp. 286-408, city Doc. No. 49, 1868]. The great study of street names and their history post-1708 was published in 1879 [see City Doc. No. 119 for 1879, Appendix J]. This included the work in 1860, but the problem was it only focused on Boston proper and many more towns had been annexed by that time. The Street Commissioners reported on 27 December 1880 to the city Council a Report of the Street Commissioners on the Nomenclature of the City's Streets [see City Doc.

Ancestry ($) is the first one everyone turns to as they created a large library of U.S. city directories from 1821 to 1989.

On January 1, 1859, two new steam engines were put in service replacing two hand engines. On October 24, 1873, the City Council passed an ordinance creating a Board of Fire Commissioners to oversee the department.

Dunkle and Ann S. Lainhart, trans., The Records of the Churches of Boston (Boston, 2002) on CD [see WorldCat (Other Libraries); FHL CD-ROM no. 1547]. The transcribers copied all baptisms, marriages, deaths, admissions, and dismissals from all Boston churches established before 1800 where records were found and include the first three parishes of Roxbury. Some transcriptions go beyond 1800. The only church not giving permission for their records to be included was the Cathedral of the Holy Cross (the oldest Catholic Church in New England). This is available online as a database at New England Historic Genealogical Society ($)., 43067=Historical Boston, then only the land of a peninsula, was a faction of the land mass it is today after massive land-fill projects of the mid- to late-19th century (the rubble from the Great Boston Fire of 1872 help fill in the waterfront) and the annexing of six towns from two counties (as listed above). Boston was first settled by passengers of the Winthrop Fleet of 1630 who first lodged in Charlestown. These first settlers were Puritans, the religious group wanting to change the Church of England from working inside the church. Called the \"City on the Hill\" by Gov. John Winthrop, the \"hub\" as we now call it became the center of trade, education, government, wealth, and power.

The Vade Mecum for America (Boston, 1732) was the first commercial guide designed for travellers. After the Revolution, some names of English or Royal bent were changed. The town ordered a new list made and it was recorded in the Town Records in 1788 that was recorded in book 8 starting on page 81. A second unofficial list was published called Names of the Streets, Lanes and Alleys in the Town of Boston in 1800. Street lists began to appear in the Boston City directories starting in 1803. The next official list came in 1834 when the 1708 and 1788 lists were reprinted and then updated with streets in the annexed South Boston, formerly Dorchester Neck. This was reprinted later the same year. An update to this report was published in 1842. As a byproduct of a project to index plans at the Suffolk Registry of Deeds in 1860, Francis Lincoln found it necessary to prepare a list of streets and their changes. This can be found there in manuscript form., 318387=3. Quaker Meetinghouse, 1661-1808, 1870-present., 587208=74. Bowdoin Square Baptist Church, 1840-1876.}",
