When we checked the pricing at the time of writing, we found eight different black (or gray) models with different CPUs, displays (resolution, touch and non-touch), RAM, storage (HDD, HDD + SSD cache, capacity), GPU (integrated or dedicated), and OS version. Lenovo's homepage also offers a red version, one with a 128 GB SSD, two different WLAN modules, and a higher-capacity battery. As of 01.09.2014, the prices range\u00a0from 520 Euros to 1084 Euros (between ~$700 and ~$1500)., 20458=The port selection is adequate and meets the expected class standards, but does not go beyond. A DisplayPort or an eSATA port is lacking, but the notebook comes with a - at least in the business segment - still indispensable VGA port, which dates back to 1987. Because of the form factor, Lenovo was able to include\u00a0standard-sized ports, so no adapters are needed. The port placement is less than ideal and not very ergonomic, as most ports are located towards the front of the notebook, which can lead to a crowded workspace when USB devices and cables are plugged in.\u00a0}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{194122=As expected, the on-chip GPU Intel HD 4600, which handles the graphics and has to share the RAM with the CPU, is not as powerful as the dedicated AMD Radeon HD 8850M with 2 GB of video RAM used in the Dell Latitude 3540, but still outperforms the Intel HD 4000 in the HP ProBook 450-H0V92EA. The more complex the application is, the larger the difference between the HD 4600 and the Radeon GPU becomes. During the comparatively simple 3DMark 2013 Ice Storm benchmark, the review notebook is able to keep up, but then falls behind by more than 220% when tasked with the more demanding Fire Strike test. The slight performance advantage of the HP ProBook 650 with identical hardware might be due to different drivers.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Theoretically, the faster 7200-rpm drive should guarantee the E540 an advantage as far as\u00a0access times\u00a0and the results of the CrystalDiskMark Read 4k QD32 benchmark test (supposed to simulate system and program starts) are concerned. According to the diagram below, these expectations are not met. We do not see 7200-rpm drives very frequently any more, which to a large extent has to do with their higher power consumption compared to 5400-rpm drives. The main advantages of a faster spinning drive are the shorter access times and the faster transfer rates. The HDD Lenovo uses - a Hitachi Travelstar Z7K500 HTS725050A7E630 - features a\u00a0sequential read speed\u00a0of 110 MB/s according to CrystalDiskMark, which is a very good value. Other notebooks with the same drive read large data blocks at up to 22% faster, however. As it stands, this particular Hitachi HDD is\u00a0one of the fastest conventional drives in our database. HD Tune confirms the excellent results.
