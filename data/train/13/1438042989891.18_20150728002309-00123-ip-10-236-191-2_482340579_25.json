Using the approach of the preferred embodiment avoids the need to invest in expensive high-end computing hardware or development of new applications designed for parallel computing in order to solve complex problems. This system allows for easy integration with existing enterprise customer software. This facilitates a low cost of entry for enterprises by permitting customers to merely modify existing code rather than writing new software solutions. The present invention bridges the gap between parallel application development and cluster computing. xCaller maintains a database of executing applications. Users can connect into existing applications or start new ones. The GUI logic is uploaded automatically if not already present. The GUI can connect and disconnect at will from any computer, anywhere. The distinctions between batch and interactive applications are generalized. The running application will block if it requires user input, until the user reconnects. The same application can be used by different types of GUI, even during the lifetime of a single instance of the application. Interfaces include HTML, CGI, Java, C/C++, DLL's, propriety socket based interfaces, Telnet. The xCaller (cross caller) is a client/server type mechanism that allows an",
