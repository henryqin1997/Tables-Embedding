            "All datasets obtained by NGDC were converted to common horizontal and vertical datums of NAD 83/WGS 84 geographic and MHW, respectively, using VDatum or Proj4. They were also converted to common file format, xyz point files, for visualization and inspection.",
            "Datasets were visually inspected with ArcGIS and QT Modeler for identification and editing of data anomalies. Datasets were then compared with overlapping datasets to ensure data consistency.",
            "xyz files of the bathymetric data were surfaced using GMT's 'surface' tool onto a 1/3 arc-second grid that interpolated to fill empty cells. Points extracted every 10 meters along the coastline were also included to ensure that the bathymetric grid reached zero at the coast. The resulting grid was clipped to the coastline to remove values over land.",
            "xyz files for each input dataset were gridded using MB-System's 'mbgrid' tool, which utilizes a high-tension spline interpolation method to fill grid cells with no input elevation values. Preferential weighting was given to more recent, higher-accuracy datasets. Gridding was performed in quadrants, each with a 5% data buffer.",
            "The DEM was quantitatively evaluated by converting to UTM-zone coordinates (units of meters horizontally and vertically) and then creating a slope grid to identify gridding artifacts in the DEM. A conversion grid was created using VDatum points to convert the MHW Fort Bragg DEM to NAVD 88."
