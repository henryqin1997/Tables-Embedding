    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{51057=After the Asian Cup Aguirre was sacked following allegations of corruption during a prior tenure. He was replaced by Vahid Halilhod\u017ei\u0107 in March 2015., 37844=However, in its first attempt to qualify with professional players, Japan narrowly missed a ticket to the 1994 FIFA World Cup after drawing with Iraq in the final match of the qualification round, remembered by fans as the Agony of Doha. Japan's next tournament was a defense of their continental title at the 1996 Asian Cup. The team won all their games in the group stage but were eliminated in the quarterfinals after a 2-0 loss to Kuwait., 451349=Since 1992, the Olympic team has been drawn from a squad with a maximum of three players over 23 years age, and the achievements of this team are not generally regarded as part of the national team's records, nor are the statistics credited to the players' international records., 49565=Japan won its opening match at the 2015 AFC Asian Cup in Group D against Asian Cup debutantes Palestine 4\u20130, with goals from Yasuhito End\u014d, Shinji Okazaki, Keisuke Honda via a penalty, and Maya Yoshida. Okazaki was also named as man of the match. They faced Iraq and Jordan in their next group matches which they won 1\u20130 and 2\u20130. They qualified to knockout stage as Group D winner with nine points, seven goals scored and no goals conceded. In the quarter-finals, Japan lost to UAE in a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw, as Honda and Shinji Kagawa missed their penalty kicks. Japan's elimination marked their worst performance in the tournament in nineteen years., 36316=Japan's first major achievement in international football came in the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, where the team won the bronze medal. Although this result earned the sport increased recognition in Japan, the absence of a professional domestic league hindered its growth and Japan would not qualify for the FIFA World Cup until 30 years later.[7] However Japan made it's first appearance in the Asian Cup in 1988, where they were eliminated in the group stage following a draw with Iran and losses to South Korea, United Arab Emirates, and Qatar., 57038=The current home kit consists of a blue jersey with Japan's crest and flag on the chest, blue shorts with bright pink patches on the side and blue socks with pink tops. The away kit is neon yellow, accented with navy blue and orange. In 2011, Japan temporarily switched the color of the numbers from white to gold., 213361=For the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the Pok\u00e9mon character Pikachu served as the mascot.[20], 57365=Prior to Adidas, Asics and Puma had been the team's official apparel sponsor. The national team kit design has gone through several alterations in the past. In the early 80s, the kit was white with blue trim. When Japan was coached by Kenzo Yokoyama (1988\u20131991) the kits were red and white, matching the colors of Japan's national flag. The kits worn for the 1992 AFC Asian Cup consisted of white stripes (stylized to form a wing) with red diamonds. During Japan's first World Cup appearance in 1998, the national team kits were blue jerseys with red and white flame designs on the sleeves, and were designed by JFA (with the sponsor alternating each year between Asics, Puma and Adidas)., 211759=Japan has one of the highest sponsorship incomes for a national squad. In 2006 their sponsorship income amounted to over 16.5 million pounds., 41113=During the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification, in the fourth round of the Asian Qualifiers, Japan became the first team other than the host South Africa to qualify after defeating Uzbekistan 1\u20130 away. Japan was put in Group E along with the Netherlands, Denmark and Cameroon.[8] Japan won its opening game of the 2010 FIFA World Cup defeating Cameroon 1\u20130 but subsequently lost to the Netherlands 0\u20131 before defeating Denmark 3\u20131 to advance to the next round against Paraguay. In the first knockout round Japan were eliminated from the competition following penalties after a 0\u20130 draw against Paraguay., 466243=Japan is the only team from outside the Americas to participate in the Copa Am\u00e9rica, having been invited in both 1999 and 2011.[2] However, Japan declined their invitation on May 16, 2011 after events related with the difficulty to release some Japanese players from European teams to play as a replacement. On May 17, 2011, CONMEBOL invited Costa Rica to replace Japan in the competition, the Costa Rican Football Federation accepted their invitation later that day., 25453=Japan is the only team from outside the Americas to participate in the Copa Am\u00e9rica, having been invited in 1999 and 2011.[2] Although they initially accepted the invitation for the 2011 tournament, the JFA later withdrew following the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami.[3], 38615=The nation's first ever FIFA World Cup appearance was in 1998, where Japan lost all their games. The first two fixtures went 1\u20130 in favor of Argentina and Croatia, despite playing well in both games. Their campaign ended with a 2\u20131 defeat to Jamaica. In the 2000 Asian Cup Japan managed to reclaim their title after defeating Saudi Arabia in the final, becoming Asian Champions for the second time., 48649=Javier Aguirre would begin a strong revamp of the team, switching out Zaccheroni's long used 4-2-3-1 formation for his own 4-3-3 and applied this with a roster of the J-League's finest, dropping many regulars. A 2\u20132 draw against Venezuela was followed by a 1\u20130 victory over Jamaica. However they lost their following game to Brazil 4-0, with. Neymar scoring all four goals. Japan's sights turned to January and their title defense at the 2015 AFC Asian Cup., 39426=Two years later, Japan co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with South Korea. After a 2\u20132 draw with Belgium in their opening game, the Japanese team advanced to the second round with a 1\u20130 win over Russia and a 2\u20130 victory against Tunisia. However, they subsequently exited the tournament during the Round of 16, after losing 1\u20130 to eventual third-place finishers Turkey., 51739=Japan possesses a strong rivalry with South Korea. Japan has played 75 matches against the South Korean football team with 40 victories, 22 draws, and 13 losses. The football rivalry is long-seated and is often seen as an extension of an overall rivalry that runs deep between the two nations. Controversies occasionally flare up between matches between the two nations, most recently at the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup, where at the final match of the tournament, played between South Korea and Japan on 28 July, South Korean fans booed the start of the Japanese anthem and later upped the political sloganeering with a banner that covered most of the width of one end of the ground that read, in Korean, \"The nation that forgets history has no future.\"(Korean: \uc5ed\uc0ac\ub97c \uc78a\uc740 \ubbfc\uc871\uc5d0\uac8c \ubbf8\ub798\ub294 \uc5c6\ub2e4),[10] apparently aiming at the Japanese leaders' reluctance to admit to wrongdoings during its militaristic and colonial past, after they displayed huge pictures of Ahn Jung-geun, who assassinated the first Prime Minister of Japan and then-Japanese Resident-General of Korea It\u014d Hirobumi back in 1909, and Yi Sun-sin, a Korean naval commander who is famed for his victories against the Japanese navy during the Imjin war in the Joseon Dynasty back in the 16th century.[11], 56169=Japan's current kit is provided by German company Adidas, the team's official apparel sponsor since 1986. The current contract with Adidas is set to end on December 31, 2015.[17], 45398=Japan started their 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup with a 3\u20130 loss to Brazil. They were then eliminated from the competition after losing to Italy 3\u20134 in a hard fought match but received praise for their style of play in the match. They lost their final game 1\u20132 against Mexico and finished 4th place in Group A in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. One month later, in the EAFF East Asian Cup, they started out with a 3\u20133 draw to China. They then beat Australia 3\u20132 and beat South Korea 2\u20131 in the 3rd and final match in the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup to claim the title. The road to Brazil looked bright as Japan managed a 2\u20132 draw with the Netherlands and a 2\u20133 victory over Belgium. This was followed by three straight wins against Cyprus, Costa Rica and Zambia., 23949=Japan is one of the most successful football teams in Asia, having qualified for the last five consecutive FIFA World Cups with second round advancements in 2002 & 2010, and having won the AFC Asian Cup a record four times in 1992, 2000, 2004 & 2011. The team has also finished second in the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup. Their principal continental rivals are South Korea and, most recently, Australia., 47424=Japan was was placed into Group C at the 2014 World Cup grouped with Ivory Coast, Greece, and Colombia. They fell in their first match to Ivory Coast 2\u20131 despite initially taking the lead, allowing two goals in a two-minute span. They drew their second game to Greece 0\u20130. To qualify for the second round they needed a victory against Colombia and needed Greece to beat Ivory Coast. Greece beat Ivory Coast 2\u20131 but Japan could not perform well against Colombia and were beaten 4\u20131, eliminating them from the World Cup. Alberto Zaccheroni resigned as head coach after the FIFA World Cup. In July 2014, former Mexico and Espanyol manager Javier Aguirre took over and Japan lost 0\u20132 to Uruguay in the first game he managed., 58558=Japan uses blue and white rather than red and white due to a superstition. In its first major international competition, the 1936 Summer Olympics, Japan used a blue kit in the match against Sweden and Japan won the match by a score of 3\u20132.[18], 37248=In 1991, the owners of the semi-professional Japan Soccer League agreed to disband the league and re-form as the professional J. League, partly to raise the sport's profile and to strengthen the national team program. The following year Japan hosted and won the Asian Cup in their second appearance, defeating Saudi Arabia 1-0 in the final. The J. League was officially launched in 1993, causing interest in football and the national team to grow., 44265=Japan then started their road to 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil with numerous qualifiers. Throughout they suffered only two losses to Uzbekistan and Jordan, and drawing against Australia. Afterwards on October 12, Japan picked up a historic 1\u20130 victory over France, a team they had never before defeated. After a 1\u20131 draw with Australia they qualified for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, becoming the first nation (outside of Brazil, who is hosting the tournament) to qualify., 54183=Japan began to develop a fierce rivalry with fellow Asian powerhouse Australia, shortly after the latter joined the AFC.[12] The rivalry is regarded as one of Asia's biggest football rivalries.[13] The rivalry is a relatively recent one, born from a number of highly competitive matches between the two teams since Australia joined the Asian Football Confederation in 2006.[14] The rivalry began at the 2006 FIFA World Cup where the two countries were grouped together. The rivalry continued with the two countries meeting regularly in various AFC competitions, such as the 2007 AFC Asian Cup, the 2011 AFC Asian Cup Final and the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup.[15], 40283=On June 8, 2005, Japan qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, its third consecutive World Cup, by beating North Korea 2\u20130 on neutral ground. However, Japan failed to advance to the Round of 16, losing to Australia 1\u20133, drawing Croatia 0\u20130 and losing to Brazil 1\u20134., 43591=At the start of 2011 Japan participated in the 2011 AFC Asian Cup in Qatar. On 29 January, they beat Australia 1\u20130 in the final after extra time, their fourth Asian Cup triumph and allowing them to qualify for the FIFA Confederations Cup.[9], 253054=The following players were called in a 23-players list for 2015 EAFF East Asian Cup on 2-9 August.[21] Caps and goals as of 16 June 2015, after the second half of the match against North Korea.}",
