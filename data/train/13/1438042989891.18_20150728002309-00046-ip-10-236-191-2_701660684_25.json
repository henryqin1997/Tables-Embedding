For example, estimates for values and tons summed from NAICS codes 4231 through 4239 equal the estimates of values and tons for NAICS code 423. 2 Ton-miles estimates are based on estimated distances traveled along a modeled transportation network. 3 Coefficient of Variation. 4 \"Truck\" as a single mode includes shipments that were made by only private truck, only for-hire truck, or a combination of private truck and for-hire truck. 5 Estimates for pipeline exclude shipments of crude petroleum., 16519=Estimates are based on the 2007 Commodity Flow Survey.
