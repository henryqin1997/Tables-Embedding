    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Just leaving home, looking for a place with a lot of opportunity. Tips for prospective students Walk throughout the school first. Make sure that this is the type of school you're truly looking for. Talk with a counselor, talk with prospective students, and spend some time down in the 'lunchroom' and library. Bang for the buck My classes are quite expensive being lab classes. However, it's much cheaper than another school somewhere else. Regular classes not geared towards Culinary or Baking are much cheaper, however. And, I definitely learn everything I need to know at a reasonable price. Am enjoying being here I walk into every class with a light heart, ready and excited to learn whatever the Chef or Professor has to teach that day. Am learning a lot As a Baking and Pastry Arts student, I am constantly in the lab rooms. I already went through all of my classroom classes, but no matter what I'm doing, I'm enjoying every bit of it, 100%. And of course, learning a LOT every step of the way. Login to",
