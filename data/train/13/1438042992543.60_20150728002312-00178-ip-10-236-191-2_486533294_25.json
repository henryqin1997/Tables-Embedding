Preferred host cells include bacteria when phage cloning vectors are used. Especially preferred host cells include E. coli strains such as strain Y1090., 340256=Trypsin catalytic activity was determined using the chromogenic substrate S-2222 (N-benzoyl-L-isoleucyl-L-glutamyl [-methyl ester]-L-arginine-p-nitroaniline, which was obtained from Kabi Pharmacia Hepar, Franklin, Ohio). The final concentration of S-2222 was 300 \u03bcM (about S times Km). Purified human pancreatic trypsin was obtained from Scripps Laboratories (San Diego, Calif.)., 194364=Expression vectors for the eucaryotes are comprised of promoters derived from appropriate eucaryotic genes. Suitable promoters for yeast cell expression vectors include promoters for synthesis of glycolytic enzymes, including those for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Hitzman et al., J. Biol. Chem., 255:2073 (1980)) and those for the metabolism of methanol as the alcohol oxidase gene in Pichia pastoris (Stroman et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,808,537 and 4,855,231). Other suitable promoters include those from the enolase gene (Holland, M. J. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 256:1385 (1981)) or the Leu2 gene obtained from YEp13 (Broach, J. et al., Gene, 8:121 (1978))., 59478=Soluble extracts of the non-hematophagous parasite, Ascaris suum, have been reported to contain an anticoagulant. These extracts were reported to prolong the clotting of whole blood, as well as clotting time in the kaolin-activated partial thromboplastin time test but not in the prothrombin time test. Crawford, G.P.M. et al., J. Parasitol., 68: 1044-1047 (1982)., 254786=The following modification from Example 5 was introduced: twenty-four hours after transfection of the COS cells (which is described in Example 5, section B) the COS-medium containing 10% FBS was replaced with 50 ml of a medium consisting of a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Nutrient Mixture Ham's F-12 (Life Technologies). The cells then were further incubated at 37\ufffd C. and the production of factor Xa inhibitory activity detected as described in Example 5., 295795=Following digestion with XbaI enzyme, the amplification product, having the expected size, was isolated from gel and subsequently enzymatically phosphorylated (T4 polynucleotide kinase from New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.). After heat-inactivation (10 minutes at at 70\ufffd C.) of the kinase, the blunt-ended/XbaI fragment was directionally cloned into the vector pYAM7SP8 for expression purposes. The recipient vector-fragment from pYAM7SP8 was prepared by StuI-SpeI restriction, and purified from agarose gel. The E. coli strain, WK6 [Zell, R. and Fritz, H.-J., EMBO J., 6: 1809-1815 (1987)], was transformed with the ligation mixture, and ampicillin resistant clones were selected., 291584=Twenty-four hours after transfection of the COS cells (refer to Example 5, section B) the COS-medium containing 10% FBS was replaced with 50 ml of a medium consisting of a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Nutrient Mixture Ham's F-12 (Life Technologies (Gaithersburg, Md.). The cells were then further incubated at 37\ufffd C. and the production of EGR-factor Xa dependent TF/factor VIIa inhibitory activity detected as described in Example E., 312478=The assay was conducted by combining in appropriate wells of a Corning microtiter plate, 50 microliters of HBSA, 50 microliters of the test NAP compound diluted (0.025-25 nM) in HBSA (or HBSA alone for uninhibited velocity measurement), and 50 microliters of the Factor Xa enzyme diluted in HBSA (prepared from purified human factor X obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, Ind.) according to the method described by Bock, P. E. et al., Archives of Biochem. Biophys. 273:375 (1989). The enzyme was diluted into HBSA prior to the assay in which the final concentration was 0.5 nM). Following a 30 minute incubation at ambient temperature, 50 microliters of the substrate S2765 (N-alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-D-argininyl-L-glycyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide dihydrochloride,obtained from Kabi Diagnostica (or Kabi Pharmacia Hepar Inc., Franklin, Ohio) and made up in deionized water followed by dilution in HBSA prior to the assay) were added to the wells yielding a final total volume of 200 microliters and a final concentration of 250 micromolar (about 5-times Km). The initial velocity of chromogenic substrate hydrolysis was measured by the change in absorbance at 405 nm using a Thermo Max\ufffd Kinetic Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Palo alto, CA) over a 5 minute period in which less than 5% of the added substrate was utilized., 336693=Factor FXIa catalytic activity was determined using the chromogenic substrate S-2366 (L-Pyroglutamyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine-p-nitroaniline, obtained from Kabi Pharmacia Hepar, Franklin, Ohio). The final concentration of S-2366 was 750 \u03bcM. Purified human FXIa was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc.(South Bend, Ind.)., 186651=A cDNA library as SfiI-NotI fragments may be directly directionally ligated into the phagemid vectors pDONG61, pDONG62 and pDONG63. Alternatively, a cDNA library which has been ligated into the lambda gt11 phage vector as described in Example 2 can be recovered by PCR, followed by isolation with electrophoresis and then directional ligation into these vectors. In the latter approach, preferred conditions for PCR use Taq polymerase; the primers, lambda gt11 primer #1218 having the sequence GGTGGCGACG ACTCCTGGAG CCCG (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass., USA) [SEQ. ID. NO. 96] and the oligo(dT)-NotI primer having the sequence, AATTCGCGGC CGC(T)15, (Promega Corp.) [SEQ. ID. NO. 95]; and 20 temperature cycles of 1 minute at 95\ufffd C., 1 minute at 50\ufffd C., and 3 minutes at 72\ufffd C., followed by 10 minutes at 65\ufffd C., 226308=The usefulness of the cDNA library was demonstrated by PCR analysis (Taq polymerase from Boehringer; 30 temperature cycles: 1 minute at 95\ufffd C.; 1 minute at 50\ufffd C.; 3 minutes at 72\ufffd C.) of a number of randomly picked clones using the lambda gtll primer #1218, having the sequence, GGTGGCGACG ACTCCTGGAG CCCG (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass., USA) [SEQ. ID. NO. 96]; targeting sequences located upstream of the cDNA insert) in combination with the above-mentioned oligo(dT)-NotI primer/adaptor; the majority of the clones was found to contain cDNA inserts of variable size., 245549=E. coli strain WK6 [Zell, R. and Fritz, H.-J., EMBO J., 6: 1809-1815 (1987)] was transformed with the ligation mixture. Thirty randomly picked ampicillin-resistant transformants were subjected to PCR analysis (Taq polymerase from Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, Md., USA; 30 cycles of amplification with the following temperature program: 1 minute at 95\ufffd C., 1 minute at 50\ufffd C., and 1 minute at 72\ufffd C.). Oligonucleotide primers used were: (i) YG103 having the sequence, AAGGCATACC CGGAGTGTGG TG [SEQ. ID. NO. 89], and matching the amino-terminus of the region encoding mature NAP, and (ii) YG60 having the sequence, GTGGGAGACC TGATACTCTC AAG [SEQ. ID. NO. 108], and targeting vector sequences downstream of the site of insertion, i.e., in the 3\u2032-untranslated region of the pEF-BOS expression cassette. Only clones that harbor the insert in the desired orientation can yield a PCR fragment of predictable length (about 250 basepair). Two such clones were further characterized by sequence determination and were found to contain the desired XbaI insert. One of the clones, designated pEF-BOS-NAP5, was used to transfect COS cells., 196528=Host cells are transformed by introduction of expression vectors of the present invention into them. Transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate for each type of cell. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride described in Cohen, S.N., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 692:2110 (1972), or the RbCl method described in Maniatis et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, p. 254, Cold Spring Harbor Press (1982) is used for procaryotes or other cells which contain substantial cell wall barriers. The transformation of yeast is carried out as described in Van Solingen, P. et al., J. Bacter., 130:946 (1977) and Hsiao, C. L. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 76:3829 (1979). Mammalian cells without much cell wall are transformed using the calcium phosphate procedure of Graham and van der Eb, Virology, 2:546 (1978). Plant cells are transformed by infection with Agrobacterium tumefaciens as described in Shaw, C. et al, Gene, 23:315 (1983). Preferred methods of transforming E. coli. and Pichia pastoris with expression vectors include electroporation., 217103=A sample of solution was tested in a factor Xa amidolytic assay as follows. Reaction mixtures (150 microliters) were prepared in 96-well plates containing factor Xa and various dilutions of the sample in assay buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4; 140 mM NaCl; 0.1% BSA) Human factor X was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, Ind., USA) and activated with Russell's Viper venom using the procedure of Bock, P. E., Craig, P. A., Olson, S. T., and Singh P., Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 273:375-388 (1989). Following a 30 minute incubation at ambient temperature, the enzymatic reactions were initiated by addition of 50 microliters of a 1 mM substrate solution in water (N-alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-D-arginyl-L-glycyl-L-arginine p-nitroanilide-dihydrochloride; S-2765; Chromogenix, M\ufffdlndal, Sweden) to yield final concentrations of 0.2 nM factor Xa and 0.25 mM S-2765. Substrate hydrolysis was monitored by continuously measuring absorbance at 405 nm using a Vmax kinetic plate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, Calif., USA)., 160622=The isolated proteins of the present invention may be prepared using solid-phase synthesis, such as that described by Merrifield, J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 85:2149 (1964) or other equivalent methods known in the chemical arts, such as the method described by Houghten in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 82:5132 (1985)., 270721=E. coli strain TG1 [Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F. and Maniatis, T., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, volumes 1 to 3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1989)] was transformed by electroporation with the pDONG/cDNA ligation mixtures. Electrotransformed cells were incubated 1 hour at 37\ufffd C. in SOC medium [Sambrook, J. et al., Ibid.] and plated on LB-agar containing 0.1% glucose and 100 micrograms/ml carbenicillin (245\ufffd245\ufffd25 mm plates; Nunc). 2.2\ufffd106, 1.6\ufffd106, and 1.4\ufffd106 carbenicillin resistant transformants were obtained with pDONG61, pDONG62, and pDONG63, respectively. From each respective library, designated 20L, 21L and 22L, a number of randomly picked transformants were subjected to PCR analysis (Taq polymerase from Life Technologies; 30 cycles of amplification with the following temperature program: 1 minute at 95\ufffd C., 1 minute at 50\ufffd C., and 1 to 3 minutes at 72\ufffd C.) using two primers that match with sequences flanking the multiple cloning site of pUC119 (primers #1224 having the sequence, CGCCAGGGTT TTCCCAGTCA CGAC [SEQ. ID. No. 116], and #1233 having the sequence, AGCGGATAAC AATTTCACAC AGGA [SEQ. ID. NO. 101]; New England Biolabs). The results showed that the vast majority of the clones contained a cDNA-insert of variable size., 282147=The remaining 17 positives were used as template for amplification with primer #1218 and an AcaNAPc2 specific primer (e.g., LJ189, targeting the AcaNAPc2 C-terminus and having the sequence GTTTCGAGTT CCGGGATATA TAAAGTCC [SEQ. ID. NO. 117]; refer to Example 10 and FIG. 9). None of the clones yielded a PCR product. All 17 positives were then subjected to a second hybridization round at lower plaque-density; single isolated clones were identified in all cases. The 17 isolated cDNA clones were re-analyzed by PCR using the primer couples #1218/YG109 and #1218/LJ189. Three out of the 17 clones yielded an amplification product with the #1218/YG109 primers., 58106=The dog hookworm, Ancylostoma caninum, which can also infect humans, has been reported to contain a potent anticoagulant substance which inhibited coagulation of blood in vitro. Loeb, L. and Smith, A. J., Proc. Pathol. Soc. Philadelphia, 7:173-187 (1904). Extracts of A. caninum were reported to prolong prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time in human plasma with the anticoagulant effect being reported attributable to inhibition of factor Xa but not thrombin. Spellman, Jr., J. J. and Nossel, H. L., Am. J. Physiol., 220: 922-927 (1971). More recently, soluble protein extracts of A. caninum were reported to prolong prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time in human plasma in vitro. The anticoagulant effect was reported to be attributable to inhibition of human factor Xa but not thrombin, Cappello, M, et al., J. Infect. Diseases, 67:1474-1477 (1993), and to inhibition of factor Xa and factor VIIa (WO94/25000; U.S. Pat. No. 5,427,937)., 358673=rFVIIa/rTF amidolytic activity was determined using the chromogenic substrate S-2288 (H-D-isoleucyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine-p-nitroaniline), obtained from Kabi Pharmacia Hepar, Inc. (Franklin, Ohio). The substrate was reconstituted in deionized water prior to use. rFVIIa and rTF/PLV were combined in a polypropylene test tube, and allowed to form a complex for 10 min in HBSA, containing 3 mM CaCl2. The assay for Ki* determinations was conducted by combining in appropriate wells of a Corning microtiter plate 50 \u03bcL of the rFVIIa/rTF/PLV complex, 50 \u03bcL of EGR-FXa, and 50 \u03bcL of either the NAP test compound at various concentrations, after dilution into HBSA, or HBSA alone (for Vo (uninhibited velocity) measurement). Following an incubation of 30 min at ambient temperature, the triplicate reactions were initiated by adding 50 \u03bcL of S-2288. The final concentration of reactants in a total volume of 200 \u03bcL of HBSA was: recombinant NAP (0.025-25 mM), rFVIIa (750 pM), rTF (3.0 nM), PLV (6.4 micromolar), EGR-FXa (2.5 nM), and S-228B (3.0 mM, 3\ufffdKm)., 311028=AcaNAPc2 or AcaNhPc2P can be purified as described above with the following protocol modifications. After thawing and diluting the media to achieve a conductivity below 8 mS, the pH of the AcaNAPc2-containing media was adjusted to pH 5.0 using NaOH. The filtered media was applied to a Pharmacia Q Fast Flow column, at a flow rate of 60 ml/min at ambient temperature, and the column was washed with 10 column volumes of 50 mM acetic acid, pH 5.0. Step elution was performed with 100 mM NaCl, 250 mM NaCl, and then 1000 ml NaCl, all in 50 mM acetic acid, pH 5.0. PT activity was detected in the 250 mM NaCl eluate. The total eluate was dialyzed until the conductivity was below 8 mS, and the protocol outlined above was followed using sulfoethyl aspartamide and RP-HPLC chromatography., 387110=The data presented in Tables 7 and 9 and FIG. 15 clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of NAP in preventing occlusive thrombus formation in this experimental model. The relevance of this data to preventing human thrombosis is clear when compared to the other anticoagulant agents, listed in Table 8. These agents were been evaluated in the same experimental models described therein, in an identical manner to that described for NAPs, and in this experimental model and have demonstrated antithrombotic efficacy in preventing thrombus formation clinically, as described in the following literature citations: Heparin-Hirsh, J. N. Engl. J. Med 324:1565-1574 1992, Cairns, J. A. et al. Chest 102: 456S-481S (1992); Argatroban-Gold, H. K. et al. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 21: 1039-1047 (1993); and Hirulog\u2122-Sharma, G.V.R.K. et al. Am. J. Cardiol. 72: 1357-1360 (1993) and Lid\ufffdn, R. M. et al. Circulation 88: 1495-1501 (1993)., 292172=The COS culture supernatant from the AceNAP4-expressing cells was centrifuged at 1500 r.p.m. (about 500\ufffdg) for 10 minutes before the following protease inhibitors (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Costa Mesa, Calif.) were added (1.0\ufffd10\u22125M pepstatinA (isovaleryl-Val-Val-4-amino-3-hydroxy-6-methyl-heptanoyl-Ala-4-amino-3hydroxy-6-methylheptanoic acid), 1.0\ufffd10\u22125M AEBSF (4-(2-amonoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride). Solid sodium acetate was added to a final concentration of 50 mM before the pH was adjusted with 1N HCl to pH 5.3. The supernatant was clarified by passage through a 0.22 micrometer cellulose acetate filter (Corning Inc., Corning, N.Y., USA)., 225861=The cDNAs were digested with NotI and EcoRI, passed over a 1.5% agarose gel (all sizeable material was eluted using the Geneclean protocol, BIO101 Inc., La Jolla, Calif.), and unidirectionally ligated into the EcoRI-NotI arms of the lambda gt11 Sfi-NotI vector (Promega). After in vitro packaging (GigapackII-Gold, Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.) recombinant phage were obtained by infecting strain Y1090 (Promega)., 273307=Human factor Xa (see Example 1 for preparation) was biotinylated with biotin-XX-NHS according to manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). The amidolytic activity of the protease was not affected by this modification as shown by an enzymatic assay using the chromogenic substrate S-2765 (Chromogenix; see Example 1). Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynal; 1 mg per panning round) were washed three times with TBS and blocked in TBS supplemented with 2% skim milk (Difco) at ambient temperature. After one hour, the magnetic beads were washed twice with TBS before use., 388208=The protocol used in these studies is a modification of a thrombosis model which has been reported previously (Lucchesi, B. R., et al., (1994), Brit. J. Pharmacol. 113:1333-1343)., 339309=Urokinase catalytic activity was determined using the substrate S-2444 (L-Pyroglutamyl-L-glycyl-L-arginine-p-nitroaniline, obtained from Kabi Pharmacia Hepar, Franklin, Ohio). The final concentration of S-2444 was 150 \u03bcM (about 7 times Km). Human urokinase (Abbokinase\ufffd), purified from cultured human kidney cells, was obtained from Abbott Laboratories (North Chicago, Ill.)., 273909=For the first round of panning, 1\ufffd1013 phage from the pooled libraries were incubated for 75 minutes at 4\ufffd C. in 200 microliters of TBS buffer supplemented with 250 nM biotinylated factor Xa, 5 mM CaCl2 and 2% skim milk. After this time, 1 mg blocked streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, resuspended in 200 microliters of TBS containing 5 mM CaCl2 and 2% skim milk, was added to the phage solution and incubated for 1 hour at 4\ufffd C. with gentle agitation. With a magnet (Dynal), the magnetic beads were then rinsed ten times with 500 microliters of TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20. Bound phage were eluted from the magnetic beads by incubating them with 500 microliters of 0.1 M glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2.0) for 10 minutes. The supernatant was neutralized with 150 microliters 1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0)., 234725=Following digestion with XbaI enzyme, the amplification product, having the expected size, was isolated from gel and subsequently enzymatically phosphorylated (T4 polynucleotide kinase from New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.). After heat-inactivation (10 minutes at at 70\ufffd C.) of the kinase, the blunt-ended/XbaI fragment was directionally cloned into the vector pYAM7SP8 for expression purposes. The recipient vector-fragment from pYAM7SP8 was prepared by StuI-SpeI restriction, and purified from agarose gel. The E. coli strain, WK6 [Zell, R. and Fritz, H.-J., EMBO J., 6: 1809-1815 (1987)], was transformed with the ligation mixture, and ampicillin resistant clones were selected., 282838=The remaining 14 clones were further analyzed by PCR amplification with the primers #1218 and oligo(dT)-Not (Promega, Madison, Wis.; this is the same primer used to prepare first strand cDNA; see Example 2). All 14 clones yielded a PCR product. Gel-electrophoretic analysis of the PCR products indicated that some cDNAs were considerably longer than the AcaNAP5 cDNA insert., 354845=The activation of human 3H-Factor IX (FIX) by the rFVIIa/rTF complex was monitored by measuring the release of the radiolabelled activation peptide. Purified human fIX was obtained from Haematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, Vt.), and radioactively labelled by reductive tritiation as described (Van Lenten & Ashwell, 1971, JBC 246, 1889-1894). The resulting tritiated preparation of FIX had a specific activity of 194 clotting units/mg as measured in immuno-depleted FIX deficient plasma (Ortho), and retained 97% of its activity. The radiospecific activity was 2.7\ufffd108 dpm/mg. The Km for the activation of 3H-FIX by rFVIIa/rTF/PLV was 25 nM, which was equivalent to the Km obtained for untreated (unlabelled) FIX., 206103=The amount to be added to such tubes, or effective amount, is that amount sufficient to inhibit the formation of a blood clot when mammalian blood is drawn into the tube. The proteins of the present invention are added to blood collection tubes in such amounts that, when combined with 2 to 10 ml of mammalian blood, the concentration of such proteins will be sufficient to inhibit the formation of blood clots. Typically, this effective amount is that required to give a final concentration in the blood of about 1 to 10,000 nM, with 10 to 1000 nM being preferred., 272193=Phage particles from the 20L, 21L and 22L libraries were rescued as follows: each library was scraped from the plates and grown at 37\ufffd C. in 100 ml LB medium supplemented with 1% glucose and 100 micrograms/ml carbenicillin until the optical absorbance at 600 nm reaches the value of 0.5. After addition of VCSM13 helper phage (Stratagene) at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 20, the culture was left to stand for 30 minutes at 37\ufffd C. and then slowly shaken for another 30 minutes. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 250 ml LB medium supplemented with 100 micrograms/ml carbenicillin and 50 micrograms/ml kanamycin. These cultures were allowed to grow overnight at 30\ufffd C. under vigorous agitation. The resulting phage particles were purified by two consecutive precipitations with polyethylene glycol/NaCl and resuspended at 1\ufffd1013 virions per ml in TRIS-buffered saline (0.05M Tris, 0.15 M sodium chloride, pH 7.4) (TBS)., 55980=A plasma protein, Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI), contains three consecutive Kunitz domains and has been reported to inhibit the enzyme activity of factor Xa directly and, in a factor Xa-dependent manner, inhibit the enzyme activity of the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex. Salvensen,G., and Pizzo, S. V., \u201cProteinase Inhibitors: \u03b1-Macroglobulins, Serpins, and Kunis\u201d, \u201cHemostasis and Thrombosis, Third Edition, pp. 251-253, J. B. Lippincott Company (Edit. R. W. Colman et al. 1994). A cDNA sequence encoding TFPI has been reported, and the cloned protein was reported to have a molecular weight of 31,950 daltons and contain 276 amino acids. Broze, G. J. and Girad, T. J., U.S. Pat. No. 5,106,833, col. 1, (1992). Various recombinant proteins derived from TFPI have been reported. Girad, T. J. and Broze, G. J., EP 439,442 (1991); Rasmussen, J. S. and Nordfand, O. J., WO 91/02753 (1991); and Broze, G. J. and Girad, T. J., U.S. Pat. No. 5,106,833, col. 1, (1992)., 339768=Chymotrypsin catalytic activity was determined using the chromogenic substrate, S-2586 (Methoxy-succinyl-L-argininyl-L-prolyl-L-tyrosine-p-nitroaniline, which was obtained from Kabi Pharmacia Hepar, Franklin, Ohio). The final concentration of S-2586 was 100 \u03bcM. (about 8 times Km). Purified (3X-crystallized;CDI) bovine pancreatic-chymotrypsin was obtained from Worthington Biochemical Corp. (Freehold, N.J.)., 192797=Procaryotes may be used for expression of the proteins of the present invention. Suitable bacteria host cells include the various strains of E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, and various species of Pseudomonas. In these systems, plasmid vectors which contain replication sites and control sequences derived from species compatible with the host are used. Suitable vectors for E. coli are derivatives of pBR322, a plasmid derived from an E. coli species by Bolivar et al., Gene, 2:95 (1977). Common procaryotic control sequences, which are defined herein to include promoters for transcription, initiation, optionally with an operator, along with ribosome binding site sequences, include the beta-lactamase and lactose promoter systems (Chang et al., Nature, 198:1056 (1977)), the tryptophan promoter system (Goeddel et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 8:4057 (1980)) and the lambda-derived-PL promoter and N-gene ribosome binding site (Shimatake et al., Nature, 292:128 (1981)). However, any available promoter system compatible with procaryotes can be used. Preferred procaryote expression systems include E. coli and their expression vectors., 182763=Disclosed herein is a method to select cDNAs encoding the proteins of the present invention from whole cDNA libraries making use of filamentous phage display technology. Current display technology with filamentous phage relies on the in-frame insertion of coding regions of interest into gene 3 or gene 8 which code for the attachment protein and major coat protein of the phage, respectively. Those skilled in the art will recognize that various difficulties are inherent in performing this with a vast mixture of cDNAs of unknown sequence and that the most practical way to obtain functional display of cDNA products would consist of fusing the cDNAs through their 5\u2032-end. Indeed, cDNA libraries of sufficient size may contain several cDNAs which derive from the same mRNA but which are 5\u2032-terminally truncated at various positions such that some of them may be expressed as fusion products. A strategy along this line, which relies on the ability of the leucine zippers Jun and Fos to form heterodimers was recently described. See, Crameri, R. and Suter, M., Gene, 137:69-75 (1993)., 281505=48 of the 300 positives were subjected to PCR-amplification (Taq polymerase from Boehringer Mannheim, Germany; 30 temperature cycles: 1 minute at 95\ufffd C.; 1 minute at 50\ufffd C.; 1.5 minutes at 72\ufffd C.) using the above mentioned YG109 primer, specific for the C-terminus-encoding sequence of AcaNAP5 and AcaNAP6 cDNAs, and primer #1218 which targets lambda-gtll sequences located upstream of the site of cDNA insertion (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.; GGTGGCGACG ACTCCTGGAG CCCG [SEQ. ID. NO. 96]). 31 out of the 48 positives yielded a PCR product of a size similar to that expected for a AcaNAP5/6-type cDNA., 269565=A phage lambda preparation of the pooled A. caninum cDNA clones (about 1\ufffd106 plaques, see Example 2) was used to PCR-rescue the cDNA inserts (Taq polymerase from Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, Md., USA; 20 temperature cycles: 1 minute at 95\ufffd C., 1 minute at 50\ufffd C., and 3 minutes at 72\ufffd C. followed by 10 minutes at 65\ufffd C.), with the lambda gt11 primer #1218 having the sequence, GGTGGCGACG ACTCCTGGAGCCCG [SEQ. ID. NO. 96] (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass., USA; targeting sequences located upstream of the cDNA insert) in combination with the oligo(dT)-NotI primer/adaptor (Promega) used for first strand cDNA synthesis. Following digestion with the restriction enzymes SfiI and NotI, the whole size-range of amplification products were recovered from agarose gel., 227590=Twenty-four positive clones, designated NAP1 through NAP24, were subjected to a second hybridization round at lower plaque-density; except for NAP24, single plaques containing a homogeneous population of lambda phage were identified. The retained clones were analyzed by PCR amplifications (Taq polymerase from Boehringer; 30 temperature cycles: 1 minute at 95\ufffd C.; 1 minute at 50\ufffd C.; 1.5 minutes at 72\ufffd C.) using the oligo(dT)-NotI primer (AATTCGCGGC CGC(T)15) [SEQ. ID. NO. 95] in combination with either (i) YG99 or (ii) the lambda gt11 primer #1218. The majority of the clones (20 out of 23) yielded a fragment of about 400 bp when the oligo(dT)-NotI/YG99 primer set was used and a fragment of about 520 bp when the oligo(dT)-NotI/#1218 primer couple was used. Nineteen such possibly full-length clones were further characterized., 173548=Hybridization probes and primers are oligonucleotide sequences which are complementary to all or part of the recombinant cDNA molecule that is desired. They may be prepared using any suitable method, for example, the phosphotriester and phosphodiester methods, described respectively in Narang, S. A. et al., Methods in Enzymology, 68:90 (1979) and Brown, E. L. et al., Methods in Enzymology, 68:109 (1979), or automated embodiments thereof. In one such embodiment, diethylphosphoramidites are used as starting materials and may be synthesized as described by Beaucage et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 22:1859-1862 (1981). One method for synthesizing oligonucleotides on a modified solid support is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,458,066. Probes differ from primers in that they are labelled with an enzyme, such as horseradish peroxidase, or radioactive atom, such as 32P, to facilitate their detection. A synthesized probe is radiolabeled by nick translation using E. coli DNA polymerase I or by end labeling using alkaline phosphatase and T4 bacteriophage polynucleotide kinase., 199976=The proteins of the present invention are added to the blood collection tubes in a variety of forms well known in the art, such as a liquid composition thereof, a solid composition thereof, or a liquid composition which is lyophilized to a solid in the tube. The amount added to such tubes is that amount sufficient to inhibit the formation of a clot when mammalian blood is drawn into the tube. The proteins of the present invention are added to blood collection tubes in such amounts that, when combined with 2 to 10 ml of mammalian blood, the concentration of such proteins will be sufficient to inhibit clot formation. Typically, this effective concentration will be about 1 to 10,000 nM, with 10 to 1000 nM being preferred., 48633=This application is a continuation of U.S. Ser. No. 08/809,455, filed Apr. 24, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,090,916, which was a 371 of PCT/US95/13231, filed Oct. 17, 1995 and a continuation-in-part of U.S. Ser. No. 08/461,965, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,872,098, Ser. No. 08/465,380, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,863,894, Ser. No. 08/486,397, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,866,542 and Ser. No. 08/486,399, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,866,543, all filed Jun. 5, 1995, each of which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Ser. No. 08/326,110, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,945,275, filed Oct. 18, 1994, the disclosures of all of which are incorporated herein by reference., 262169=The retained clones were further characterized by PCR amplification of the cDNA-inserts using the oligo(dT)-NotI primer (Promega; this is the same primer used to prepare first strand cDNA; see Example 2) [SEQ. ID. NO. 95] in combination with the lambda-gtll primer #1218 having the sequence, GGTGGCGACG ACTCCTGGAG CCCG [SEQ. ID. NO. 96] (New England Biolabs; primer #1218 targets lambda sequences located upstream of the site of cDNA insertion). PCR amplifications were performed as follows: Tag polymerase from Boehringer; 30 temperature cycles: 1 minute at 95\ufffd C.; 1 minute at 50\ufffd C.; 1.5 minutes at 72\ufffd C. Gel-electrophoretic analysis of the PCR products clearly demonstrated that cDNAs of roughly the same size as the AcaNAP5 cDNA (e.g., 400 to 500 bp) were obtained for each species. In addition to these AcaNAP5-sized cDNAs, some Ace and Adu cDNAs were estimated to be about 700 bp long., 51946=Initiation of the blood coagulation response to vascular injury follows the formation of a catalytic complex composed of serine protease factor VIIa and the non-enzymatic co-factor, tissue factor (TF)(Rappaport, S.I. and Rao, L.V.M. (1992) Arteriosclerosis and Thrombosis 12: 1112-1121). This response appears to be exclusively regulated by the exposure of subendothelial TF to trace circulating levels of factor VIIa and its zymogen factor VII, following a focal breakdown in vascular integrity. Autoactivation results in an increase in the number of factor VIIa/TF complexes which are responsible for the formation of the serine protease factor Xa. It is believed that in addition to the factor VIIa/TF complex, the small amount of factor Xa which is formed primes the coagulation response through the proteolytic modification of factor IX to factor IXalpha which in turn is converted to the active serine protease factor IXabeta by the factor VIIa/TF complex (Mann, K. G., Krishnaswamy, S. and Lawson, J. H. (1992) Sem. Hematology 29: 213-226.). It is factor IXabeta in complex with activated factor VIIIa, which appears to be responsible for the production of significant quantities of factor Xa which subsequently catalyzes the penultimate step in the blood coagulation cascade; the formation of the serine protease thrombin., 277539=Single stranded DNA was then prepared from the five positive clones and the inserts 3\u2032 to the gene 6 were submitted to automated DNA sequencing using the primer #1224 having the sequence, CGCCAGGGTT TTCCCAGTCA CGAC [SEQ. ID. NO. 116] (New England Biolabs). All five clones were found to contain the same 470 bp 5\u2032-truncated cDNA fused in frame to gene 6 in pDONG63. The nucleotide sequence of this cDNA as well as the deduced amino acid sequence are depicted in FIG. 9 [SEQ. ID. NO. 19]. The cDNA, designated AcaNAPc2, encodes a protein, designated NAP isoform c2, that belongs to the NAP family of related proteins., 255479=The COS culture supernatant containing Pro-AcaNAP6 was centrifuged at 1500 r.p.m. for 10 minutes before adding solid sodium acetate to a final concentration of 50 mM. The following protease inhibitors were added (all protease inhibitors from ICN Biomedicals Inc, Costa Mesa, Calif., USA): 1.0\ufffd10\u22125 M pepstatin A (isovaleryl-Val-Val-4-amino-3-hydroxy-6-methyl-heptanoyl-Ala-4-amino-3-hydroxy-6-methylheptanoic acid), 1.0\ufffd10\u22125 M leupeptin, 5\ufffd10\u22125 M AEBSF (4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride). The pH was adjusted with HCl to pH 5.3. The supernatant was clarified by passage through a 0.2 micrometer cellulose acetate filter (Corning Inc., Corning, N.Y., USA)., 275861=For the second panning round, 6\ufffd1012 phage were incubated during 90 minutes with 1 mg blocked streptavidin-coated magnetic beads in 200 microliters of TBS containing 2.5 mM Ca2+ and 2% skim milk (this step was introduced in the procedure to avoid selection of streptavidin-binding clones). After removal of the beads, the same protocol was followed as for round 1. Rounds 3, 4 and 5 were accomplished as round 2, except that the phage input was lowered to 2\ufffd1012 phage., 207804=The use of blood collection tubes containing the diagnostic compositions of the present invention comprises contacting a effective amount of such diagnostic composition with mammalian blood drawn into the tube. Typically, when a sample of 2 to 10 ml of mammalian blood is drawn into a blood collection tube and contacted with such diagnostic composition therein; the effective amount to be used will include those concentrations of the proteins formulated as a diagnostic composition which in the blood sample are sufficient to inhibit the formation of blood clots. Preferred effective concentrations would be about 1 to 10,000 nM, with 10 to 1000 nM being especially preferred., 335991=Factor Xa catalytic activity was determined using the chromogenic substrate S-2765 (N-benzyloxycarbonyl-D-arginine-L-glycine-L-arginine-p-nitroaniline), obtained from Kabi Pharmacia Hepar, Inc. (Franklin, Ohio). All substrates were reconstituted in deionized water prior to use. The final concentration of S-2765 was 250 \u03bcM (about 5-times Km). Purified human Factor X was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc. (South Bend, Ind.) and Factor Xa (FXa) was activated and prepared from Factor X as described [Bock, P. E., Craig, P. A., Olson, S. T., and Singh, P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 273:375-388 (1989)]., 177263=Preferred conditions for amplification of cDNA include those using Taq polymerase and involving 30 temperature cycles of: 1 minute at 95\ufffd C.; 1 minute at 50\ufffd C.; 1.5 minutes at 72\ufffd C. Preferred primers include the oligo(dT)-NotI primer, AATTCGCGGC CGC(T)15 [SEQ. ID. NO. 95], obtained from Promega Corp. in combination with either (i) the degenerate primer having the oligonucleotide sequence: AAR GCi TAY CCi GAR TGY GGi GAR AAY GAR TGG [SEQ. ID. NO. 94], wherein R is A or G, Y is T or C, and i is inosine, or (ii) the lambda gt11 primer #1218, GGTGGCGACG ACTCCTGGAG CCCG [SEQ. ID. NO. 96], obtained from New England Biolabs., 338419=Plasmin catalytic activity was determined using the chromogenic substrate S-2366 (L-Pyroglutamyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine-p-nitroaniline, obtained from Kabi Pharmacia Hepar, Franklin, Ohio). The final concentration of S-2366 was 300 \u03bcM (about 4 times Km). Purified human plasmin was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc. (South Bend, Ind.)., 57248=Chem, 262: 9718 (1987); Nutt, et al., J. Biol. Chem, 26:10162 (1988). A 6,000 daltons recombinant protein containing 58 amino acids with a high degree homology to antistasin's amino-terminus amino acids 1 through 58 has been reported to inhibit the enzyme activity of factor Xa. Tung, J. et al., EP 454,372 (Oct. 30, 1991); Tung, J. et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,189,019 (Feb. 23, 1993)., 303478=The NAP amplification product, having the expected approximately 250 bp size, was digested with DraI and SpeI enzymes, purified by extraction with phenol: chloroform: iso-amyl alcohol (25:24:1, volume/volume) and precipitated in ethyl alcohol. The recipient vector-fragment from pYAM7SP8 (Example 3) was prepared by StuI-SpeI restriction, purified by extraction with phenol:, 278333=Antiserum against M13 phage was prepared in rabbits by subcutaneous injections of about 1013 M13K07 phage in 500 microliters of PBS (0.01 M sodium. phosphate, pH 7.4+0.15 M sodium chloride) combined with ea equal volume of adjuvant. The M13KO7 phage were CsCl-purified essentially as described by Glaser-Wuttke, G., Keppner, J., and Rasched, I., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 9: 239-247 (1989). The initial injection was done with Complete Freunds adjuvant on day 0, followed by subsequent injections with Incomplete Freunds adjuvant on days 7, 14 and 35. Antiserum was harvested on day 42., 309720=The filtered media was applied to a Pharmacia SP-Fast Flow column, at a flow rate of 60 ml/min at ambient temperature, and the column was washed with 10 column volumes of 50 mM citrate/phosphate, pH 3.5. Step elution was performed with 100 mM NaCl, 250 mM NaCl, and then 1000 mM NaCl, all in 50 mM citrate/phosphate, pH 3.5. PT activity was detected in the 250 mM NaCl eluate. The total eluate was dialyzed until the conductivity was below 8 mS., 337544=Kallikrein catalytic activity was determined using the chromogenic substrate S-2302 (H-D-prolyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-arginine-p-nitroaniline, obtained from Kabi Pharmacia Hepar, Franklin, Ohio). The final concentration of S-2302 was 400 \u03bcM. Purified human kallikrein was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc. (South Bend, Ind.)., 249760=The COS culture supernatant containing Pro-AcaNAP5 was centrifuged at 1500 r.p.m. (about 500\ufffdg) for 10 minutes before adding solid sodium acetate to a final concentration of 50 mM. The following protease inhibitors were added (all protease inhibitors from ICN Biomedicals Inc, Costa Mesa, Calif., USA): 1.0\ufffd10\u22125 M pepstatin A (isovaleryl-Val-Val-4-amino-3-hydroxy-6-methyl-heptanoyl-Ala-4-amino-3-hydroxy-6-methylheptanoic acid), 1.0\ufffd10\u22125 M leupeptin, 5\ufffd10\u22125 M AEBSF (4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride). The pH was adjusted with HCl to pH 5.3. The supernatant was clarified by passage through a 0.2 micrometer cellulose acetate filter (Corning Inc., Corning, N.Y., USA)., 228470=The cDNA inserts of five clones were subcloned as SfiI-NotI fragments on both pGEM-5Zf(\u2212) and pGEM-9Zf(\u2212) (Promega). Because the SfiI sites of lambda gt11 and pGEM-5Zf(\u2212) are not compatible with one another, the cloning on this vector required the use of a small adaptor fragment obtained after annealing the following two 5\u2032-end phosphorylated oligonucleotides: pTGGCCTAGCG TCAGGAGT [SEQ. ID. NO. 99] and PCCTGACGCTA GGCCATGG [SEQ. ID. NO. 100]. Following preparation of single-stranded DNA, the sequences of these cDNAs were determined with the dideoxy chain termination method using primer #1233 having the sequence, AGCGGATAAC AATTTCACAC AGGA (New England Biolabs) [SEQ. ID. NO. 101]. All five clones were found to be full-length including a complete secretion signal. Clones NAP5, NAP7 and NAP22 were found to have an identical coding region. Clones NAP6 and NAP11 are also identical but differ from the NAP5 type of coding region. FIG. 1 depicts the nucleotide sequence of the NAP5 gene and FIG. 2 depicts the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded, AcaNAP5. Likewise, FIG. 3 depicts the nucleotide sequence of the NAP6 [SEQ. ID. NO. 5] gene and FIG. 4 depicts the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded, AcaNAP6 [SEQ. ID. NO. 6]., 276397=Twenty-four individual carbenicillin resistant clones that were isolated after five rounds of panning against biotinylated factor Xa, were then analyzed by ELISA. Streptavidin-coated 96-well plates (Pierce) were blocked for 1 hour with 200 microliters of TBS containing 2% skim milk per well, then were incubated for 1 hour with 100 microliters of 20 nM biotinylated factor Xa in TBS per well. For each clone, about 1010 phage diluted in 100 microliters TBS containing 2% skim milk and 0.1% Tween-20 were added to the wells. After a 2-hour incubation, the wells were rinsed four times with 200 microliters TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20. Bound phage were visualized by consecutively incubating with a rabbit anti-M13 antiserum (see Example 11), an alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-rabbit serum (Sigma), and p-nitrophenylphosphate as substrate (Sigma). Absorbances were taken at 405 nm after 20 minutes. Out of the 24 clones, five bound strongly to factor Xa. No significant non-specific binding was observed with these phage when tested in the same ELISA with omission of biotinylated factor Xa.}",
