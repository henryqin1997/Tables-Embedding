There aren't too many majors but that is certainly changing. Many departments of top of the line, competing with some of the top schools."

It has been said, Wentworth is easy to get into but hard to stay at. This is a pretty accurate statement regarding the hard to stay at part, I can assure you. Wentworth is a very demanding, hands-on institution. The professors expect a lot from students right out of the gate (especially design students). If you choose to go to Wentworth, it should be because you are serious about what you want to do in the future. If you are a prospective student, it would be wise to aim for at least a 1600 on your SAT, and if you choose to take the ACT, aim for at least a 24 overall. These scores are no guarantee for acceptance, but they are scores that have worked for previous prospective students. If you are not involved in a club or sports team in high school...GET INVOLVED! College admissions love seeing students who are involved with community service, sports and other activities; getting involved certainly will improve your chances of getting into Wentworth., 40429=What to do for fun at Wentworth\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2\u00a6 It's Boston! You definitely do not have to stay on campus all the time! There are hundreds of fun options\u00c3?\u00c2? that the city has to offer. You can take the T basically anywhere you want to go around Boston. You can go to the Prudential Center, which is basically any mall-goers paradise. The Boston Common and Copley Square are always nice places to go to with friends, and your adventures there can be very fun. During the winter Frog Pond is open to the public in the Boston Common, so if you can ice skate you will definitely want to experience that in the month of December while all the holiday lights peacefully surround you. If you like art museums, the Museum of Fine Arts is RIGHT next to Wentworth's campus, and admission is free with your student ID! There are also events known as Weekends at WIT that are held every weekend. Games are played, prizes are won, and fun is experienced! You can always go to the Boston Aquarium, the Museum of Science, a Bruins game, a Red Sox game, or see a production at Symphony Hall. There are often deals through Wentworth that allow you to do these things at discounted prices ($8 tickets to a Sox game or a trip to the aquarium...and more). There are also movie showings on campus or at local campuses. It is always fun to meet up with friends from high school at local colleges in Boston to watch a new movie that the colleges have limited access to!, 168779=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 49179=The campus is safe and the dorm's always have desk guards after 8 O'clock, 23169=Food and dining is Wentworth's achilles heal. Contracted out to a company called Chartwells, many students complain of limited hours, bad service, and overpriced food. I personally and inclined to agree. On weekends, the latest a student can eat on campus is 6:30. On weeknights it's 8 pm. Adjacent Northeastern University has late-night (up to 3am) dining options for its students.}",
