    "textBeforeTable": "NOTE: Mobile traffic is not rebroadcasted over the output frequency of the dispatch channels. Instead, only a beeping tone is broadcast to signify to the field units that someone is talking. To monitor units in the field you must program in the input frequencies also. The corresponding L-TAC channel is included in brackets. The following explanation is an excerpt directly from the Southern California Frequency Directory: Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department operates a conventional radio system referred to as the \"480 System\" within the department, because of the frequencies it occupies. The system uses over sixty repeater sites around the county, most of which are on hilltops, to relay communications. The hilltops from which a particular repeater transmits from is dependant upon the area that channel was intended to cover. Communications on a particular channel will sound the best when monitoring from within or near the area that the personnel assigned to that channel patrol. With the exception of Special Units Dispatch (which has countywide coverage), Dispatch and Local Tactical channels each have the smallest area of intended coverage. As a result, a listener must be relatively closer to a particular dispatch area to hear communications on that channel clearly. Conversely, Area Tactical and Countywide Tactical channels each are intended to cover the territory of several or all of the dispatch channels combined. As a result, listeners can hear communications on any given Area Tactical and Countywide Tactical channels from further",
