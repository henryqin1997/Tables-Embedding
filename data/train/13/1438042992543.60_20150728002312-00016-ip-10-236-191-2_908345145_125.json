            "The campus police are always available and there are alarms almost all over campus if assistance is needed. WEMS is also available during all times",
            "WIU offers a wide variety of clubs and activities that make it easy to get involved.",
            "Usually my friends and I go to the rec center or walk around campus. Sometimes we go to the union or dividends for a break from dining hall food.",
            "The food is good most of the time, but there aren't very many healthy options. A majority of dining halls have a good variety of foods that make it easy to have a different meal each night of the week.",
            "The dorms aren't very comfortable due to the fact a majority are very old, but in the past few year there have been many worth while renovations. Compared to other schools dorm rooms, however, there is still a lot of work to be done.",
            "Coming from a very competitive high school district the academic's at WIU aren't too difficult if you stay ahead. I do have to work for grades, but I'm slightly less busy than I was in high school.",
            "If you need help with anything don't be afraid to ask because WIU has plenty of resources at your disposal. Also try to take advantage of all the on campus organizations. There is such a variety that it's hard to not find something you're interested in!",
            "Western Illinois has many things available to students, including a health center on campus and a great recreational facility. The various organizations on campus make it easy to get involved without taking too much time away from school work. They also offer many opportunities for academic help if someone is struggling, and there are tutor available almost any time of the day."

Besides the ratings i believe that if a student is serious about their academics they will do just fine. The professors are great and it is up to the student on what kind of grades they would like to obtain., 494398=Western is roughly $21,000 for a student coming in for Fall 2013. The rates adjust with every new class. The rate is locked in meaning it will never increase so you will always know what to expect depending on how many credit hours you take. For the price of $21,000 you are receiving exactly what you're paying for. Students often complain about the stuff we don't have but we're not exactly paying a lot of money. We have free transportation to and from Walmart and the other stores in our city and the computer lab offers free printing. The bookstore is an arm and a leg but that's at most schools. Western doesn't offer a lot of book vouchers., 526114=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 166193=Who like a crowd but not too big of a crowd. Great Class Sizes 22:1, 153799=At Western Illinois, these are referred to as Residence Halls. They are currently renovating multiple Residence Halls at WIU because most of them were built in the 1970's and were not built to last. The biggest downfall of the Residence Halls is the inconsistent temperature control in the rooms. WIU will not turn on Air Conditioning until June, leaving the spring semester finals to be dreadfully hot. The Resident Advisers, or RA's do a great job of holding educational meetings for the students to attend and see what the town and university have to offer. If there is a problem with roommates or others on the floor, the office of Student Development works well with the students to accommodate their needs. Most incoming Freshmen are excited to experience college in the only way they have seen, by drinking. Office of Public Safety makes regular rounds on the weekends down the halls of the buildings and will not be afraid to look into open rooms. Most of the Residence Halls are Dry meaning alcohol cannot be brought into the building, this means even empty bottles will result in a fine or violation. If there are any damages on your floor, you and everyone else will be fined, I would advice working together with the other floormates to ensure that does not happen.}",

Tips for prospective students I'd probably get your dorm room or apartment as soon as possible, because housing in Macomb/Western fills up fast, and there are a lot of students living in the dorms. I'd also visit the Scholarship early and often, and apply for any scholarships as soon as possible. Bang for the buck Western is probably one of the most affordable of Illinois' public state schools, and",
