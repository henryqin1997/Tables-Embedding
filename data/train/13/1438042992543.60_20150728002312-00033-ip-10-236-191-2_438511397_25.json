He had previously served a residential qualification period having come over on the Richie Richardson scholarship to Sutton Valence School. He struggled to make an impression early on, but during the 2008 season something clicked. He went on a wicket-taking spree during mid-season - claiming 17 wickets in two Championship games, and 55 all told - as well as hauls in one-day cricket. It was enough to earn him a call-up to the England Performance Squad for the tour of India. That interest proved to be shortlived and a worsening iunjury record caused Kent to release him in 2011 after he had taken 144 Championship wickets, at an average of 31.25, in his first spell with the Club. He spent a season at Leicestershire and seemed to have dropped out of first-class cricket in 2013 only for Kent to re-sign him for 2014 in recognition of their lack of seam bowling depth. Rewards were limited as he took 12 wickets in six Championship matches., 56910=Sep 17, 2008, 34449=Born January 20, 1982, Antigua}",
