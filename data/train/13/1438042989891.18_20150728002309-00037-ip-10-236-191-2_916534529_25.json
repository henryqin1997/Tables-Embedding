    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students creative, outgoing, determined. People here are really into art and creativity and it's just a good atmosphere to be around people that are all into the same thing. Tips for prospective students good grades is a must and you have to be really determined. Bang for the buck The teachers really go all the way for the students. They want everyone to go above and beyond. Even a simple English class goes the extra mile. Am enjoying being here New York City is just one of my favorite places and the atmosphere really puts you in the right mood to be determined to succeed. Am learning a lot The professors have so much background and really make it interesting so you want to learn.
