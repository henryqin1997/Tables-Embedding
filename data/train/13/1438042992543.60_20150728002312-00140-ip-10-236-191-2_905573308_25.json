            "I feel very safe at King. Security is always circling campus. If you feel unsafe at night, security will escort you to your car.",
            "I feel as if I am receiving a high quality education.",
            "In the tri-city area there is a lot to do. Just about 2 miles from school is State Street. State street has cute boutique shops, restaurants, and bakeries. During the spring, summer, and fall State Street will close the road to have concerts and festivals. In September, Rhythm & Roots is a folk music festival. One year Mumford & Sons were an act in the festival. At Exit 7, there are many restaurants, shops, and a theater. Viking Hall sometimes has musical acts this year American Idol star Scotty McCreey came. Also coming to Bristol in the next two years are a Bass Pro Shop and Cabela's along with many other shop in two new shopping centers. About 40 minutes away is Johnson City. Johnson City has many malls and restaurants. Freedom Hall Civic Center has some shows throughout the year such as Jason Aldean. Every year a local radio station has Acoustic Christmas at Freedom Hall. This years acts included: Fall Out Boy, Jason Derulo, Emblem3, Fifth Harmony, MKTO, and Midnight Red. Also, there is Kingsport which is made up of restaurants and malls too.",
            "King has a chicken place called Dippers. Dippers serves chicken,wings, sometimes soups, and fried pickles. Dippers is wonderful. There is also Java Bean which serves coffee and pastries. I have not been here, but it stays busy so I'm assuming it is good. Finally there is the dining hall. The dining hall has different stations such as pizza, cheeseburgers, grill cheese, salad, rolls, and desserts. The dining hall basically has anything you could want. All three of these stay open all day.",
            "I do not live in a dorm, but dorm life does not seem to bad.",
            "The professors at King make sure their courses challenge you to think critically and analytically. By making these courses hard I am able to look back and be like oh yeah I remember how to do that because it was so hard.",
            "Whenever you apply for college make sure to go tour not only your top choice but also other options. Whenever you visit a school this allows you to see what life is like there. Sometimes your first choice may prove to be your last choice after visiting.",
            "King University is a great school in Bristol, TN. It has a friendly student body and caring professors. At King the professors want their students to pass and will go out of their way to help them."

The students and staff here are more than happy to help you with any of your needs or concerns. Bang for the buck Money is tight, especially with the economy. The tuition keeps going up which doesn't help students who do not have money to spend on college. Definitely look into financial aid. There are many resources available to help you through the money troubles of paying for college. Am enjoying being here I love that there are all four seasons here in TN. You can watch nature change and experience all of mother natures qualities. Am",
