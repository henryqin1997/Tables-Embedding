PhD students register for directed studies if their proposal has not been approved. Once a proposal has been approved by the Director, MS students sequentially register for and complete credits in each succeeding terms until the capstone/thesis is complete and has been successfully defended.\u00a0 If a student fails to register for any given term without written approval by the Associate Dean, that student will be withdrawn from the program. MS\u00a0students wishing to register for Capstone or Thesis Credits must\u00a0have had their\u00a0proposal\u00a0accepted by the\u00a0Oceanographic Center Program Office.\u00a0 \u00a0 A student who has not had their proposal approved by the program office may have to register for a Directed Independent\u00a0Study and must contact the Program Office for the Course Reference Number (CRN) associated with their major advisor. Capstone, Thesis, Ph.D. Directed Study, and Dissertation Credits Electives will open up to the student body 2 weeks after registration starts.
