The offer to match the terms of the agreement reached by MLB and DIRECTV remains open to iN Demand and Dish until the deadline of March 31, 2007. The communication sent to our office today by iN Demand is not responsive to that offer. In spite of their public comments, the response falls short of nearly all of the material conditions (among them requirements for carriage of The Baseball Channel and their share of the rights fees for Extra Innings) set forth in the Major League Baseball offer made to them on March 9.\u201d, 110442=Along with March 31st (the deadline by MLB for cable and DISH to meet DirecTV's offer), put March 27th on your calendar as well., 67290=With that, the satcaster has released the upcoming 2007 schedule for Extra Innings., 129893=MLB and DirecTV were brilliant in how they framed the opening for the other carriers: Place our upcoming The MLB Channel on your basic tiers, be consistent with the rates and carriage requirements by March 31st, and we\u2019ll back away from the exclusive deal we have on the table with DirecTV., 81834=Maury Brown will discuss this latest news at 6:25PM EDT on XM 175.\u00a0, 26786=My name is Carl Vogel, and I am President and Vice Chairman of EchoStar. Since we began offering service 11 years ago, EchoStar\u2019s DISH Network has grown to become the 4th largest multi-channel video provider in the country serving more than 13 million subscribers. Exclusive content distribution deals in any major sport today do not promote competition. They harm existing consumers while limiting choices in the future. As we sit here today, the deal presented by Major League Baseball is designed to be an exclusive deal for DirecTV in substance, despite statements to the contrary regarding form and the opportunity to \u201copt-in\u201d. The terms offered by Major League Baseball effectively tie the carriage of the Extra Innings package TODAY to a firm commitment to launch The MLB Channel to over 10 million of our subscribers in 2009. We find these demands inconsistent in a climate where Congress, the FCC, and the American public are asking for more a-la-carte choices., 130709=\"In general, we've asked for the equivalent of one movie ticket per subscriber per year for us to be included on their most broadly distributed tier, or basic tier,\u201d said NFL Network spokesman Seth Palansky in September of 2006.}",
