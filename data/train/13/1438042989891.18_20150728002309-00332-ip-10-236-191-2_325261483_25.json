The gear box and aluminum side-plate are stamped into one complete unit. The Trinidad reels feature six stainless steel ball bearings to help maintain overall drive train smoothness. On a fully-spooled reel, the 6.2:1 gear ratio provides the fast retrieve speed needed when fishing for species such as king mackerel and wahoo.\u00a0 Additionally, the Trinidad's handle has a unique ergonomic shape for comfort, plus an adjustable power handle shank allowing you to set the right amount of leverage when cranking. Other features include Super Stopper, a one-way roller bearing, combined with Shimano's new Assist Stopper to create a unique dual anti-reverse system. As for the adjustable clicker, it isn't a simple on/off system: it can be adjusted to 14 tension settings to accommodate the size of your bait or your style of fishing., 31066=SPEEDMASTER Fish are fickle, no? Sometimes it seems they'll eat a bait that's dangling from your teeth. Other times you can't get anywhere near them. And some species, like Kingfish, take the bait and keep on coming, leaving a belly in the line that the bionic woman couldn't reel in fast enough.\u00a0 So what are you going to do about it? May we suggest two options. And the Speedmaster has a 6:1 gear ratio that helps you get rid of that belly and beat the King at his own game. Either way, you're prepared. And that's the whole battle., 35532=We kept the traditional round shape, but simplified it with a sleek, one-piece, solid aluminum frame. We recessed the reel seat so the reel mounts closer to the rod for a more comfortable feel. Resisting the temptation to over-indulge it with features and gimmicks, we kept it pure and focused strictly on performance. The result is a finely tuned piece of machinery with liquid-smooth mechanics and museum-quality appearance - a standout in your collection. From the diminutive Calcutta 50 to the impressive 700, it's a reel you'll be as proud to own years from now as you were the day you bought it. Since introducing the Calcutta 200 in 1991, we have made very few improvements to it. Not because we're resting on our laurels, but simply because more advanced technology is just not available today. So we channeled our energies into creating a full line of Calcuttas for all kinds of anglers and all kinds of waters. Each reel offers the exceptional smoothness Calcutta is known for, a highly functional yet uncomplicated design, and a more natural palm feel for endless hours of casting. It's been seven years since we brought the Calcutta to life, and the design, both aesthetically and functionally, has proven itself timeless. Even if you've found a way to wear out the one you bought in 1991, you can be confident that your new Calcutta will please you every bit as much as your first., 20364=TLD STAR DRAG Fish are fickle, no? Sometimes it seems they'll eat a bait that's dangling from your teeth. Other times you can't get anywhere near them. And some species, like Kingfish, take the bait and keep on coming, leaving a belly in the line that the bionic woman couldn't reel in fast enough.\u00a0 So what are you going to do about it? May we suggest two options. The TLD Star gives you outstanding castability with both real and artificial baits so you can stalk the school from afar. And the Speedmaster has a 6:1 gear ratio that helps you get rid of that belly and beat the King at his own game. Either way, you're prepared. And that's the whole battle.\u00a0 Because fish are moody. Tackle shouldn't be.}",

The anchovies are laughing at you from the recesses of the bait tank. Standing erect is an exercise in futility. And it looks like rain. Now someone's saying you must use plug tackle.\u00a0 Whew. It was just a bad dream. How silly of you to think you couldn't use your BaitRunner when you bought it specifically because you can use it in any situation. You can cast beautifully with it. You can fly-line a live bait with the bail closed and still have spool control. You can even use it for big freshwater species.\u00a0 It's perfect.\u00a0\u00a0 Absolutely perfect.
