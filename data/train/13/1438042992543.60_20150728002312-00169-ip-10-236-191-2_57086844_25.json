It capped an 11-play, 79-yard drive with 8:43 left in the half., 67151=Peyton Hillis ran for a career-best 184 yards and two scores on 29 carries for the Browns (3-5), who have won two in a row sandwiched around a bye week, and helped head coach Eric Mangini gain a measure of revenge against the team which employed him as a defensive coach from 2000-05., 68523=McCoy put the Browns ahead 24-7 with 5:53 to play in the third quarter, as his bolt for the left pylon from 16 yards out was upheld by a lengthy review., 68688=The rookie signal-caller then orchestrated a 13-play, 61-yard march which bridged the third and fourth periods and ended on a 37-yard field goal from Dawson., 68858=The visitors earned a reprieve on their next series, as a defensive pass interference call on a 4th-and-10 gave them possession at the Browns' one. Brady hit Hernandez two plays later, cutting the Patriots' deficit to 27-14 with 6:37 remaining., 69115=However, Hillis broke to the outside and rolled into the end zone for a 35- yard score with 2:38 to play and the Browns extended their advantage to 34-14.}",
