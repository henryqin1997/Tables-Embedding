The device also has third and fourth L shaped members connected to the first and second members, with the fourth L member being spaced from the third L member. The first and second members pivot about a hinge joint from a folded configuration to an extended configuration. The third and fourth L shaped members extend from a folded configuration to an extended configuration about their respective hinged joints. The exercise device is transformed from a compact form when the third and fourth L shaped members are moved from the folded configuration to an extended configuration in a first position and separated in a second position to extend the first and second members from a folded to an extended position. 20130040784 Published Description Patent application number Jeff Gillespie, Fort Lauderdale, FL US 02-17-2011 APERTURED NONWOVEN FABRIC AND PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING SAME - Disclosed is a process for continuous perforation of fabrics that comprise thermoplastic fibers. The process utilizes a combination of heat and pressure to perforate fabrics where the shape. size, and distribution of the individual fabric perforations is define solely by the design of the pattern embossing roll, In particular, the top side",

The present invention provides an insert that includes a carrier, a thermally expandable material located on at least a portion of the carrier, and at least one integrally formed attachment that projects outwardly from the carrier. The inserts of the present invention are preferably placed within a hollow cavity in a transverse direction so that once the insert is sealed into place via the thermally expandable material, the hollow cavity is separated into two separate chambers. 09-17-2009 20100289242 STRUCTURAL MOUNTING INSERT HAVING A NON-CONDUCTIVE ISOLATOR - The present invention is predicated upon methods and devices for positively mounting structural members while preventing or substantially limiting exposure of such members to environmental conditions possibly leading to corrosion. 11-18-2010 20110278802 STRUCTURAL MOUNTING INSERT HAVING A NON-CONDUCTIVE ISOLATOR - The present invention is predicated upon methods and devices for positively mounting structural members while preventing or substantially limiting exposure of such members to environmental conditions possibly leading to corrosion. 11-17-2011 20130255855 STRUCTURAL MOUNTING INSERT HAVING A NON-CONDUCTIVE ISOLATOR - The present invention is predicated upon methods and devices for positively mounting structural members while preventing or substantially limiting exposure of such members to environmental conditions possibly leading to corrosion. 10-03-2013 20140292029",
