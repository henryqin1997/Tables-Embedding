            "Drury is close to downtown Springfield so there is a lot of night life to partake in, if that's what you like. Drury is also a wet campus so there is usually a lot of parties and nights out if you want to go out.",
            "The food is definitely the worst aspect of Drury. The commons makes the same, less than satisfying food daily. There are no outside food chains and there is only one cafe which is only semi-decent.",
            "The dorms are quite expensive and you don't have the choice of living elsewhere. There isn't a big variety of options because there is only three dorms on the campus. They aren't the biggest or most modern dorms but they get the job done and they're close to most classes.",
            "Drury is a very prestigious school, well known for their academic program. The courses are quite rigorous but not unbearable. The professors are very willing to help out if you are confused or fall behind.",
            "Drury is a fantastic school. It's small high school like environment feels homey and despite the tuition rates, I would recommend it to anyone. Everyone supports everyone at Drury and it's like another family."

Not to mention our ability to create divinity privately in our homes, and in peaceful serenity., 29714=Only a decade after Civil War ended did, Drury's founders build this Congregationalist compound into a college, what is now considered Drury University. These war heroes chose Springfield as a divine are to grow both spiritually and mentally after this traumatic event. The college\u00c3\u00a2??s mission began with Nathan Morrison, first President to Drury's, whose main goal was minister to the healing of the horrid wounds made by civil war. (Church Affiliations, 2012.) Drury has maintained this fellowship on campus with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Fellowship members and organizational leader meet for bible study the Potter House. Originally the DOC fellowship was held in the Drury School of Religion. This fellowship has remained a major influence and tradition of Drury\u00c3\u00a2??s heritage. (Church Traditions, 2012.) According to Drury, The DOC tradition emphasizes the integration of the theoretical and the practical. (Church Traditions, para, 4. 2012) Hence, influence by the Scottish School of Common Sense played an express role when they demonstrated how cold pragmatic leadership is a strict diplomatic implementation of both moral and religious experience. They were clear about the importance of human knowledge and discipline (Church Traditions, 2012.) Site: 1. Drury University. 2012. Church Affiliations.

Rock band Nirvana once played in this dramatic arena. Sutherland Field is where you locate active students playing outdoor intramural sports, pick up frisbee, and touch football. Sutherland field also hosts outdoor movies for the buff in a lawn chair. Do not miss the July 4th's fireworks display! That is the most toxic event for the scientist inside, who has no fear of smoke and flames\u00c3\u00a2?\u00c2\u00a6 alright so nice\u00c3\u00a2?\u00c2\u00a6 Blowe!!! Sutherland field is full of energy and ka boom! Springfield Hall is another place you will find the active student enjoying dance class and/or a play and/or a symphony. This is where the theatre is located and the studios stretch and pull at the hamstrings and gluteous maximus. Ahhh\u00c3\u00a2?\u00c2\u00a6 Feel and watch as the strength and beauty shines throughout this theatre. Just head on up to the second floor in southwing. Remember when all stretching and watching through go to the first floor to engage in our most elegant part of this dramatic experience. Sit down\u00c3\u00a2?\u00c2\u00a6 speak of love and laughter through a cup of coffee at the Campus eXchange. Talk of the beauty and art of human anatomy and how good humans look in theatre and how good we feel when we work out. Speak of the elegance and grace in every flowing movement and motion of dance and energy production. Make joy of our masterpieces and bask in their glory of refined skill. This is where amazing works are defined, you see\u00c3\u00a2?\u00c2\u00a6 Coffee or tea?}",
