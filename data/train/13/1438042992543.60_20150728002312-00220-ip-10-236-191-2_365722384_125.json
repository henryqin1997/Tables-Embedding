The heartbeat (active process) is enabled when both DXI and keepalives are enabled on the interface. The echo (passive process) is enabled when DXI is enabled on the interface. The heartbeat mechanism automatically generates a heartbeat poll frame every 10 seconds. This default value can be changed with the keepalive (LMI) command., 504781=destination host 10.0.0.32 port 9999, 585301=201700, 787151=The following example illustrates how to enable multicasting. In addition to IP and ARP requests to E100.0999.9999, the router at address C120.4444.9999 will also receive a copy of the multicast request. The host at address 172.16.1.15 is incapable of receiving broadcast packets., 786466=The following example illustrates how to enable pseudobroadcasting. The router at address C120.4444.9999 will receive a copy of the broadcast request because the broadcast keyword is specified with the smds static-map command. The host at address 172.16.1.15 is incapable of receiving multicast packets. The multicasting is simulated with this feature., 577378=ietf--The IETF\u2019s standard RFC 1356 method for identifying the protocol is used., 509774=X.121 1311001, 584836=101600, 875634=Frame Relay DLCI number, in the range 16 to 1007., 716482=Addresses are entered in the Cisco SMDS configuration software using an E prefix for multicast addresses and a C prefix for unicast addresses. Cisco IOS software expects the addresses to be entered in E.164 format, which is 64 bits. The first 4 bits are the address type, and the remaining 60 bits are the address. If the first 4 bits are 1100 (0xC), the address is a unicast SMDS address, which is the address of an individual SMDS host. If the first 4 bits are 1110 (0xE), the address is a multicast SMDS address, which is used to broadcast a packet to multiple end points. The 60 bits of the address are in binary-coded decimal (BCD) format. Each 4 bits of the address field presents a single telephone number digit, allowing for up to 15 digits. At a minimum, you must specify at least 11 digits (44 bits). Unused bits at the end of this field are filled with ones., 575772=ietf--The IETF\u2019s standard RFC 1356 method was used to set up a single protocol virtual circuit., 503783=12131, 875941=(Optional) Frame Relay SSCS DLCI number, in the range of 16 to 991.
