Reviewer has been to campus. 8 out of 8 people found this review useful. 2 of 28 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Those who care about academics but want a welcoming, fun atmosphere Tips for prospective students Visit campus and see just how nice Naperville is to live. The admissions team was really friendly and helpful both on the telephone and when I visited campus! Bang for the buck Although the tuition is not cheap, merit aid scholarships were very helpful in my case. Will enjoy being here The area around the campus is downtown Naperville and includes a great place to take walks (the Riverwalk), shopping, and restaurants. Since this college is close to Chicago, there are also nearly endless things to do within a 45 minute drive or train ride. Will learn a lot",
