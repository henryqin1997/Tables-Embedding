            "Campus safety is spectualr at Chico. There are 40 blue lamppost around campus and each one of them have a phone that directly links the phone call in case of a emergency to our police department. The campus is well lit and there is always people around which will make a student feel a little safer in case something was to ever happen.",
            "Was not apart of Greek Life",
            "There are about 200 different clubs on campus and they are all great! Some clubs such as CAVE you have to apply for just because they only allow a certain amount of students each semester. This club is great for volunteer work and it looks great on your resume. PSY CHI is a psychology club and i hear it looks wonderful on your resume. They have guest speakers come out and talk to them and they do fundraisers. The Nursing students have a nursing program is a another great club to be apart of if your a nursing student. They put on really big events such as a Ball and they fundraise money, and do health care things.",
            "I think this campus is great for students who are majoring in liberal studies, Psychology, Child development, Nursing, All Engerinering.",
            "Chico State is one of the cheaper schools to attend. One thing that has been addressed to me is to go and study abroad. Why? Is because most of the places are cheaper than attending Chico State. They really try to get students to go because they get to experience out of the world experiences.",
            "There are so many things to do in Chico. A lot of students ride their bike around town and there are tons of bike paths to go on and ride your bike for miles. There is also Bidwell park which is a beautiful place to walk, run, take your dog on a walk, or ride your bike. Downtown chico is a block away from campus and there are events going on almost every weekend. Floating down the river is the thing to do over summer; it is nice and relaxing.",
            "The cafeteria we have at Chico State has a variety of food. If I want mexican food one day I can go to the Mexican section of the cafeteria and order what I am craving. Pete's coffee on campus is the best! If someone is tired Pete's is the place to go and get your fix!",
            "I did not live in the dorms I was a transfer student but what I have heard is everyone becomes everyones friend and they all hang out in each other dorm rooms. I have also noticed people who live in the dorms carry on their friendships throughout their entire time and beyond when they are at Chico State.",
            "Depending on your major every major has their hardest classes. The professors at Chico State really help you out and emphasize to come to their office hours. I makes me as a student to want to go and talk to them because I can get one on one time with them to help me understand the materials I am not understanding. The teachers push you and want to make you pull your hair out sometimes but at the end of the semester it makes you feel good as a student to know you can be pushed and you succeeded.",
            "For those who are searching for the right school Chico should be considered. It has a great atmosphere and everyone here is extremely helpful and friendly. The academics are great and if you attend here you will get the most out of your education.",
            "Chico State is a great college town. I have met some of the nicest people since I have moved here. The academic are great, everyone takes school serious and stays focused throughout the entire semester; which makes it easier because we are all in the same boat."

My mind changed at summer orientation when I saw all of the clubs and opportunities Chico actually gave you. -If you have a meal plan try and organize how many meals a week you should be having. Because both semesters I had so many meals left over and the last week I tried to eat around 5 times a day! -Be prepared for both extreme heat from August to early October, and extreme cold in the winter. And when I say extreme I mean extreme for someone from the Bay Area. (100degrees and 30degrees), 217698=Okay, I'm going to divide the food and dining into two categories-the dining hall on campus and dining out in town. The Sutter Dining Hall was only recently opened in 2011, so it's extremely new and modern. However, the food options aren't necessarily the greatest. But I guarantee if you ask anyone at any school, they'll all tell you that they're dining hall stinks. Now as for downtown dining, it's awesome. There's a great pizza place called Celestino's (it's been a huge staple while I've lived in Chico), and also a burger/bar joint called The Bear (you have to try the jiffy burger...yes, it's a burger with peanut butter on it!), 584889=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here I have only met the best people and friends at Chico. It is easy to get into that party scene, but with the challenging academics, focusing on school is just as easy and way more important. Everyone always says people only go to Chico State for the partying, but I always say that im there to get one of the best buiness degrees in the state of CA. Am learning a lot As a business student at Chico State, it is very competetive and i feel that the teachers are there not only to teach you the information required, but also give you real hands on experience with the subject matter.
