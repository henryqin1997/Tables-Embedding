He is less demonstrative than some of his colleagues as well. He signals fours with an economical wave, and gives a nod before giving a batsman out. That aside, he remains unobtrusive, which is no bad thing for an umpire. Martin Williamson April 2007, 47541=As a middle-order batsman and legspinner, Aleem Dar's playing career spanned a decade without ever really taking off, but that is in stark contrast to his umpiring. In 2000 he stood in his first ODI aged 32 and within two years he had been appointed to the ICC panel. In 2003 he officiated in the World Cup, emerging with his reputation enhanced, and his Test debut followed in October of that year, immediately winning plaudits for making sounds decisions in tough matches in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. It was not to anyone's surprise when, six months laterm he was promoted to the ICC's elite panel. Since then he has earned a reputation as one of the best, and with Simon Taufel he represents the pick of the younger officials. In April 2007 he stood in the World Cup final, but the farcical finale of that match - and his role in misinterpreting the rules regarding bad light - led to his suspension for the Twenty20 World Championships in September., 52084=Feb 14, 2015, 64510=The Cricket Monthly: Few Sri Lankans have been as widely adored.
