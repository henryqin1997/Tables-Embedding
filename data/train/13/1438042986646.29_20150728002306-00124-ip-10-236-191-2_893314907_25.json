Learn to separate social time and homework. Set time apart for homework. Log off Facebook! Maybe plan frequent study dates with friends. Whatever needs to be done, it's just imperative to study or you'll get behind real quick. On a lighter note; WORK STUDY! Work = Money. Simple as that. Within the first or second week of July go to the Financial Aid office and ask for Work Study. PUT YOUR NAME ON THE LIST. They may or may not ask you to, YOU ask to if they don't. If you don't put your name on the list, you won't get work study., 63463=Gulf Coast football games are the best to be at. Great players and amazing fans. The football players love the band and can't get enough of us when we play in the stands and march during half time., 119503=We have official Gautier police officers who keep watch at our campus 24/7. We are able to keep their number on speed dial and call them for pretty much any need. For example, I have a night class and don't get out till 9 or 9:30, if I did not feel safe walking to my car alone I could call them and they would escort me to my vehicle., 92629=It's a really good school! My tuition is usually somewhere around 1300 dollars each semester.}",
