Food and Dining Decent Dorm Life Wright has doesnt have dorms. Tips for prospective students Always ask for help, if you are unsure about something. the professors are mostly always happy to help. In three sentences Wilbur Wright is a great college. I think if you are avoiding the costly expenses of a four year intuition, then wright is the best choice to get your basic class over and done with.The professors are very friendly and helpful, and the classes are small, so you get a more hands on.
