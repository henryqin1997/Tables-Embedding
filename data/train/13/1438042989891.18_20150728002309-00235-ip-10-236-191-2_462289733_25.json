For example, polyamides such as any of the well-known nylons are available from a number of sources. Particularly preferred polyamides are nylon-6, nylon-6,6, nylon-11, and nylon-12. It should be noted that the selection of a particular polyamide material should be based upon the physical requirements of the particular application for the multi-layer article. For example, nylon-6 and nylon-6,6 offer better heat resistance properties than nylon-11 and nylon-12, whereas nylon-11 and nylon-12 offer better chemical resistance properties. In addition, other nylon materials such as nylon-6,12, nylon-6,9, nylon-4, nylon-4,2, nylon-4,6, nylon-7, and nylon-8 may be used, as well as ring-containing polyamides such as nylon-6,T and nylon-6, 1. Suitable nylons include VESTAMID\u2122 L2140, a nylon-12 available from Creanova, Inc. of Somerset, N.J. Polyether-containing polyamides, such as PEBAX\u2122 polyamides (Atochem North America, Philadelphia, Pa.), may also be used., 134881=To evaluate the adhesion between the coating composition and stainless steel panel, the coatings were evaluated using the Tape Test Adhesion in accordance with ASTM D-3359 and the MEK Rub Test in accordance with ASTM D-4752-87. The results of this testing are presented in Table 13. To evaluate the adhesion and durability between the coating composition and the stainless steel panel in a coolant, the coatings, after immersion in a coolant (available commercially from The Penray Companies, Inc. as Pencool\u2122 3000-diluted with DI water and ethylene glycol at 1:16:16 ratio) at 105 degrees C. were subjected to the Tape Test Adhesion described above. The test results are shown in Table 13., 51727=Commercially available elastomers include NIPOL\u2122 1052 NBR (Zeon Chemical, Louisville, Ky.), HYDRIN\u2122 C2000 epichlorohydrin-ethylene oxide rubber (Zeon Chemical, Louisville, Ky.), HYPALON\u2122 48 chlorosulfonated polyethylene rubber (E. I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., Wilmington, Del.), NORDEL\u2122 EPDM (R. T. Vanderbilt Co., Inc., Norwalk, Conn.), VAMAC\u2122 ethylene-acrylate elastomer (E. I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. Wilmington, Del.), KRYNAC\u2122 NBR (Bayer Corp., Pittsburgh, Pa.), PERBUNAN\u2122 NBR/PVC blend (Bayer Corp., Pittsburgh, Pa.), THERBAN\u2122 M hydrogenated NBR (Bayer Corp., Pittsburgh, Pa.), ZETPOL\u2122 hydrogenated NBR (Zeon Chemical, Louisville, Ky.), SANTOPRENE\u2122 thermoplastic elastomer (Advanced Elastomer Systems, Akron, Ohio), and KELTAN\u2122 EPDM (DSM Elastomers Americas, Addis, La.). The substrate may include a second fluoropolymer. The substrate may have one or more surface polar functionality present thereon to enhance bonding, such as, for example, an amino, carboxyl and hydroxyl functionality., 85206=The cure rheology of the samples was investigated by testing uncured, compounded mixtures using the Alpha Technology Oscillating Disk Rheometer (ODR) Model 2000 and the procedure described in ASTM D 2084-82. All samples exhibited good curing properties., 86239=The resulting sample was cut into three 25.4 mm wide stripes. Peel or adhesion strength was measured on the three strips in accordance with ASTM D 1876 (T-peel test). To facilitate testing of the adhesion between the layers via a T-peel test, a sheet of 0.05 mm thick polyester (PET) was inserted before pressing about 2.54 cm between the fluoroelastomer coated sample and the Compound I sheet. A Monsanto Tensometer 10 at 100 mm/min crosshead speed was used as test device. The peel strength results are shown in Table 6., 94433=In Example 6, a sample was prepared and tested as in Example 2 except different substrates were used for Examples as listed in Table 7. In Example 7, THV X 610 G, melting point 185\ufffd C., available from Dyneon, LLC, was used. In Example 8, a film of Fluorothermoplastic A (Table 4) was used. In Example 9, a film of Fluorothermoplastic C (Table 4) was used. In Example 10, a film of Fluorothermoplastic D (Table 4) was used. KF-1100, PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) available from Kureha, was also used. The peel strength results are shown in Table 7., 95071=In Examples 7-11, samples were prepared and tested as in Example 2 except different substrates were used for Examples as listed in Table 7. In Example 7, THV X 610 G, melting point 185\ufffd C., available from Dyneon, LLC, was used. In Example 8, a film of Fluorothermoplastic D (Table 4) was used. KF-1100, PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) available from Kureha, was also used. The peel strength results are shown in Table 7., 105716=In Example 13 and 14, and Comparative Example H, the samples were prepared and tested as in Example 2 and 6, and Comparative Example B, respectively, except that peel strengths were tested after the samples were immersed in Fuel C (isooctane:toluene=50:50 vol %) at 23 degrees C. for 48 hours. The peel strength results are shown in Table 8., 44689=VDF-containing fluoroplastics may be prepared using emulsion polymerization techniques as described, e.g., in Sulzbach et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,338,237 or Grootaert, U.S. Pat. No. 5,285,002, hereby incorporated by reference. Useful commercially available VDF-containing fluoroplastics include, for example, Dyneon\u2122 THV 200, THV 400, THV 500G, THV 610X fluoropolymers (available from Dyneon LLC, St. Paul, Minn.), KYNAR\u2122 740 fluoropolymer (available from Atochem North America, Philadelphia, Pa.), HYLAR\u2122 700 (available from Ausimont USA, Inc., Morristown, N.J.), and fluoroelastomers, such as Dyneon\u2122 FC-2178 (available from Dyneon LLC)., 122549=In Example 21, the fluoroelastomer coating solution in Example 19 was coated about 30 mm from the edge of SUS 304 stainless steel pipe having an outside diameter of 12.5 mm by dipping an end of the pipe into the solution. Multiple layers of THV 500 (inside layer, 0.2 mm thickness) and ECO, a copolymer of ethylene and epichlorohydrin, (outside layer, with an inside diameter of 1.25 cm) was used for the hose sample. The fluoroelastomer solution as used in Example 2 was coated to the inside layer of the THV500/ECO hose by sucking the solution up into the hose about 30 mm from the end. Afterwards, both coated samples were allowed to dry at 120 degrees C. for 10 minutes and then post-cured at 170 degrees C. for 10 minutes. The stainless pipe was inserted into the 30 mm length of THV/ECO hose. The sample had the structure of FIG. 3. The maximum force required to separate the stainless pipe and THV/ECO hose (pull-apart test) in accordance with SAE J2044 was measured using the Tensometer 10 (available from Alpha Technology) at 50 mm/min crosshead speed. The pull apart test results are summarized in Table 11.}",
