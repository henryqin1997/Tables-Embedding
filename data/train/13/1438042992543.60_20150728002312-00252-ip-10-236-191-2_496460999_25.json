No. 10/305,041, filed Nov. 26, 2002 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,780,920, which is a divisional application of Ser. No. 09/112,540, filed Jul. 9, 1998 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,841,609., 102297=Separation of the coarse and fine (submicron) fractions of the milled silica gel product was accomplished by a two step centrifugation process (90 min. at 1400 G's, decant, then 40 min. at 2,000 G's). The final submicron particle suspension was obtained by simply decanting. The solids content of the supernatant dispersion was 13 wt. % and yield was determined to be 41% (on a dry SiO2 basis)., 117898=A dispersion of 8.4% solids was prepared using Zeothix\u2122 177 precipitated silica from Huber. The dispersion was then milled (using Netzsch mill), centrifuged (except only at 2000 G's for thirty minutes), measured and tested in the same manner as Sample 1. The results are reported in Table 1., 92803=The amount of pigment to binder in the formulation varies depending on the formulations used. For applications such as ink receptive coating formulations, the weight ratio of pigment to binder in the formulation is 1:100 to 100:1. The ratio depends on the application. If it is desired to prepare an ink receptive coating formulation in which PVC is less than CPVC, the pigment/binder ratio is typically about 1:1 to about 1:50. If a PVC greater than CPVC is desired, the pigment/binder ratio is typically about 1:1 to about 4:1., 195734=435 gms (as is basis) of Syloid 221 silica were dispersed in 1800 gm DI water. 100 gms diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride polymer (Calgon CP261LV, poly [dadmac]) were added with intensive mixing. 10 cc of 3.5 M HCl were then added. This mixture was wet-milled using a Netzsch LMZ-05 media mill with 0.6-0.8 mm SEPR media. The dispersion was passed through the mill for a total of 45 min. at a flow rate of 0.67 L/min., with recycle of mill product into the mill feed tank. The product pH was 3.2, and the particle size was:, 178165=434 gms (as is basis) of Syloid 74\ufffd6500 were dispersed in 1800 gm DI water. 140 gms of aluminum chlorohydrol (23% by weight Al2O3) were added with intensive mixing. 10 cc of 2M NaOH were then added. This mixture was wet-milled using a Netzsch LMZ-05 media mill with 0.6-0.8 mm SEPR media. The dispersion was passed through the mill a total of eight times at a flow rate of 0.6 kg/min. The product pH was 3.2, and the particle size was:, 116601=The resulting slurry was then centrifuged for thirty minutes at 600 G, 2000 G, or 27,000 G. Viscosity derived pore volumes (PVa), dried pore volumes (N2 BJH porosimetry), as well as particle size distribution and BET surface areas (nitrogen porosimetry) were measured for the parent dispersion, milled dispersion and each of the centrifuged dispersions. The results are reported in Table 1 below., 22037=It also is well known in the art that glossy and permeability properties of coatings comprising inorganic pigment and binder depend on the PVC. See Outlines of Paint Technology 3rd ed., W. M. Morgans, Halsted Press (a division of John Wiley & Sons, Inc.) New York, N.Y., 1990, p.7. When a coating is formulated below the CPVC, a matte effect is created by imparting surface roughness and can be generally attained when the pigment particle size is large when compared to the coating thickness. Relatively glossy coatings can be achieved when the pigment particles are small when compared to the coating thickness. Thus, matte finishes and coating gloss can be controlled by judicious choice of pigment particle size in relation to the coating film thickness. However, unless the binder is hygroscopic, such coatings will be relatively impermeable to water. For an ink-jet printing application with aqueous inks, such a coating would suffer from the shortcoming of relatively long ink dry-time. A key attribute of ink-receptive coatings is the ability to absorb the ink fluid rapidly so that the image becomes fixed to the media as quickly as possible. This minimizes smudging., 118819=A sample of Nalco 1140 colloidal silica available from Nalco was measured and tested in the same manner as described for Sample 1. The median particle size of 0.015 micron is taken from literature available in the art. The results are reported in Table 1., 181074=The zeta potential for this sample was determined to be about +22 mV using Coulter Delsa 440SX electrophoretic mobility analyzer. The sample was allowed to sit for one month and then redispersed by mixing at 2000 RPM for 2 min. using a 60 mm dia. Cowles blade in a 118 mm diameter container, and the particle size was again measured to be, 48936=For example, the effect of loading small particles on the viscosity of a dispersion of those particles in a Newtonian fluid is described by I. M. Krieger in Adv-Coll. Interface Sci., 1972, 3, 111. The formula defines the reciprocal of}",
