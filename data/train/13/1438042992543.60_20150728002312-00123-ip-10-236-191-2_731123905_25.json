Heats and feature races were lined up according to points, making for some great match-ups in all divisions. The MI Army National Guard MI Modified division was no exception, as they ran their feature caution free. Twenty one Modifieds lined up for their 35-lap feature, and at the drop of the green, it was Perry Davenport jumping out to the early lead. Davenport led through lap 21, with Justin Kazmar, Chris Ozanich, Tim Easey, and Bud Perry rounding out the top five. Lap 23 saw Jason Parish make his way around Perry for fifth, and two laps later, Kazmar grabbed the top spot from Davenport. Kazmar pulled away from the field on lap 28 and began working the rear of the field on lap 33. At the stripe, it was Kazmar, Davenport, Parish, Ozanich, and Easey as the top five. Heat wins were awarded to Bill Luckhurst, Dick LaPratt, and Kazmar. Point leader, Dane Long, for the Performance Automotive Northwest Street Stock division, found himself sitting ninth on the grid for the start of the 25-lap feature. Marc Smith started on the pole and immediately drove into the lead, followed by Corey Davis, Mike Ammerman, Dave Thorburn, and Butch Morence. Long worked his way into the top five by lap five, and up to fourth by lap 10. Caution on lap 11 for Ammerman closed the field up behind Smith, and on the restart, Long went to work on Davis for second. Long took over second on lap 13, as Thorburn tried to find a way around Davis for third. Bubber Patrick was looking for a way around Thorburn for fourth but couldn\u2019t get it done. Long drove into first around Smith on lap 16, and Damon Place got around Patrick on lap 20 for fifth behind Thorburn. At the checkered flag, it was Long, Smith, Davis, Thorburn, and Place. Ed Newman Jr. and Place took heat wins. Eighteen Q106 Pony Stocks charged from the starting gate with cars running three- and four-wide going into turn one. John Ward led the herd down to the stripe as everyone was making a charge to the front. Jimmy Scavarda took over the lead on lap four, with Ward still hot on his heels. Lap five had Trei Deubel, Brian Passick, and Julie Dailey up into the top five behind Scavarda and Ward. Lap 10 had Scavarda and Deubel going at it for first, with Scavarda using lapped traffic to his advantage, as Jerry Garland jumped into the top five ahead of Dailey. At the line, it was Scavarda, Deubel, Passick, Garland, and Dailey. Garland and Scavarda tallied heat wins for the evening. The Andrews Chevrolet Super Late Models saw Craig Willett take the lead in their 40-lap feature on Maurer\u2019s Textile Night. Dale Lewis had a different idea as he made his way around Willett on lap five to take over the lead ahead of Lee Taylor, Evan Barrett, and Garry Duram. Stan Perry broke into the top five on lap 10. Lewis and Taylor pulled away from the field on lap 15, with Perry sitting in third. Chris Place and John Ledwidge took over the fourth and fifth positions by lap 20. Dave Stehouwer looked high and low for a way around Ledwidge, as Perry drove to the outside of Taylor on lap 22, with Stehouwer breaking into the top five on lap 25. Stehouwer, Place, and Jimmy Gallagher were three-wide vying for fourth on lap 28. Perry moved into second around Taylor on lap 30, as Taylor came back to challenge for second on lap 31. Stehouwer moved to the outside and got around Taylor for third on lap 35. Perry darted to the outside of Lewis for first, couldn\u2019t make it stick and Stehouwer ducked under Perry for second. At the conclusion, it was Lewis, Stehouwer, Taylor, Perry, and Place. Doc Dutton and Evan Barrett were credited with heat wins.}",
