The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the rule is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of May 19, 2014. 20 CFR Parts 718 and 725 Summary Physicians and adjudicators use chest radiographs (X-rays) as a tool in evaluating whether a coal miner suffers from pneumoconiosis (black lung disease).
