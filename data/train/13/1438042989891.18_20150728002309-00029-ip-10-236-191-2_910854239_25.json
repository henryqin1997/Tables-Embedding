The Poo Say signs appear on campus every Tuesday morning and occasionally comment on campus political life and student life. The Poo Say signs are nailed to the trees on campus and most are designed to promote school spirit. Purple Poo members appear in public dressed in costume to conceal their identity. Many members un-mask at the Leadership and Service Awards Ceremony each April while others choose to have their pictures appear in the Grassburr. At commencement, graduating members will pass a purple pig to the university president as they pass across the stage., 367252=Has amazing professors. Has a lot of country people and cowboys.

Students moved into their residence halls on Aug. 19 and experienced a week full of activities designed to help them meet their academic and social objectives. The week also guided students through the resources available to adjust to Tarleton's environment and culture. Please take advantage of this week.

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students If you are planning on majoring in agriculture, Tarleton is perfect for you. Tarleton specializes in the agricultural studies and being in the middle of a country town, they definitely know what they are talking about. Tarleton also has one of the best barrel racing teams in Texas, so if you're a rodeo kind of person it's great. Even if you're not into the whole rodeo scene, there is a spot for you a Tarleton. I'm an English major and I love my classes and the whole environment at Tarleton. There is a great fine arts system at Tarleton as well, so theatre majors, music majors, and art majors are welcome and at home. Over all, Tarleton is a great school for everyone. Tips for prospective students If you plan on attending Tarleton and living on campus you are going to be required to purchase a meal plan. You may think you're going to eat three times a day in the dining hall, but trust me, you don't have time to do so. I'm on the 10 meals per week plan and I have never used all of them in one week. It's cheaper to just get the 10 meal plan and some ramen for your dorm room for those days you miss dinner. Bang for the buck",
