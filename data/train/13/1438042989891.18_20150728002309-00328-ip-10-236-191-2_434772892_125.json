He also stole 17 bases.....The Chiefs return to ICL action on Thursday when they host the Mooney Dental Tanners of Woburn at Tufts University's Huskins Field at 6:00 PM..., 97245=(Special to www.andrechiefs.com) August 18, 2008 Wakefield, MA- Right up until the\u00a0moment Nate Leva's screaming line drive was snagged by\u00a0Lexington shortstop Anthony Santos to end their semi-final series against the powerful and veteran laden Blue Sox\u00a0late Sunday afternoon, they just would not quit., 131243=The Chiefs, now 13-7-5,\u00a0head to Trum Field in Somerville on Tuesday night for a 6:15 PM date with the first place Cassell Club. Lefty David Garcia is expected to draw the starting assignment for the Chiefs., 125940=The win, the\u00a0Chiefs fourth in a\u00a0row and seventh in their last eight games,\u00a0raised their\u00a0season record to 14-7-5 with just six games remaining in the regular season.

Ace Keith Forbes is expected to draw the starting assignment., 598224=Dylan Ellis will get the start when the Chiefs travel to Playstaed Park to take on the Medford Americans on Friday at 6:00 PM. On Sunday the Chiefs travel to Ferullo Field in Woburn in an 8:00 PM start. Ace right-hander Keith Forbes will get the starting nod in that one., 96137=They fought through injuries and\u00a0matched the\u00a0ICL's best, pitch for pitch and hit for hit, as the young club matured with each passing day. In fact, the Chiefs went 11-2-1 over their last fourteen regular season games\u00a0and finally clinched a playoff spot on August 9th.\u00a0To go along with the six hard fought ties, the team was involved in\u00a0ten one run games and five two run games. Those numbers mean that 21 of their 37 games were decided by two runs or less, including six last inning wins. 'These kids don't know how to quit\" said Chiefs veteran manager Chuck Andre, following another come from behind win in late July., 424081=The Chiefs are off on Wednesday and will host the Cassell Club in\u00a0a battle of 3-1 teams on Thursday at Tufts University at 6:00 PM. Southpaw Dylan Ellis\u00a0 (Gloucester, MA/Merrimack College), who\u00a0took a no decision in the Chiefs 4-3 win over the Americans last Friday, is expected to draw the starting assignment., 173368=Lexington, MA- Damage to the field in Lexington has caused the postponement of tonight's (Tuesday) Chiefs at Blue Sox game that was scheduled for 8:00 PM. The Town of Lexington held their annual Fourth of July carnival and fireworks display over the holiday weekend, and despite the best efforts of the Lexington Recreation Department and Blue Sox management, the field will not be ready for tonight's game. It has been re-scheduled for Tuesday, August 5., 613603=The former San Diego Padres righty showed signs of brillance last season, his first back after two shoulder surgeries. Forbes was dominant while going 3-1 and posting an ERA of 1.75 despite some nagging shoulder issues. He threw the first Chiefs no hitter since 1995 when former Red Sox hurler Mike Carista accomplished the feat. Forbes was overpowereing in his no-no in Wakefield on June 13. He nearly duplicated that effort two weeks later when he took another no hitter into the last inning\u00a0and settled for a\u00a0one hit win over the Americans. Most impressive was Forbes 79 strikeouts in just 44 innings, a strikeout to innings pitched ratio not seen in the ICL in over a decade., 85328=Lexington, MA- The Chiefs will open their 2009 ICL season on Saturday, May 30\u00a0against the Wakefield Merchants\u00a0at Lexington High School as part of the Eleventh Annual Jerie DeAngelis Memorial Day of Baseball., 154170=Bishop (1-0) picked up the first win of his three year ICL career while Foundas chalked up his fifth save of the season.

He said the team that was always behind but somehow always won is one of his favorite memories. \u201cI gave up 12 runs in the first inning,\u201d Morse said of that championship game. \u201cMy favorite memory is of giving up a 300-foot home run and him laughing his rear end off in the dug out.\u201d, 90055=\"This\u00a0these guys\u00a0remind me of\u00a0the\u00a01989 team\u00a0\" said Andre, when approached after the game. If his assessment is correct, that will mean very good news for Chiefs fans. The 1989 team he was speaking of, qualified for the ICL playoffs on the final day of the regular season but was quickly dispatched by the veteran filled Augustine A's. That same group of players went on to dominate the ICL for the next ten seasons, winning four championships, six pennants, and playing over .750 baseball, which included two record setting eighteen game unbeaten streaks., 85084=The Chiefs-Merchants game is scheduled at 6:00 PM and will be part of three game slate that is planned. The Lexington Blue Sox will host the\u00a0Woburn Tanners at 1:00 PM with Testa Corp. Bombers and Medford Americans scheduled at 3:30 PM., 256365=The Chiefs could not take advantage of their outstanding bullpen work and managed only three singles from Brendan Pyburn, Phil Costello (RBI) and Koslowski (RBI). The Chiefs will attempt to get their offense back on track on Monday evening at 6:00 PM when they host the Medford Americans at Tufts University at 6:00 PM., 92622=Veteran ace and former pro Keith Forbes anchored a solid pitching staff that will\u00a0only improve next season with the expected return of a few arms that were with the club in 2006 and 2007. Two of those additions are expected to be righty's Danny Lozeau of Bryant and Mike DiCato of UMass-Amherst. Lefty Jeff DeCarlo of Michigan and Jared Freni\u00a0of UMass\u00a0could also be\u00a0on the horizon. Lozeau, DiCato, DeCarlo and Freni all saw action with the young Chiefs in 2006 or 2007., 147881=The Chiefs infield was flawless as SS Brendan Pyburn (3 putouts, 5 assists), 2B Mike Barbati (2 putouts, 6 assists), 3B Mike Andre (5 assists) and 1B Paul Koslowski (15 putouts) backed Ellis' 81 pitch, complete game effort. The Chiefs infield quartet also turned two double plays. Ellis was the first Chiefs pitcher to throw a complete game without recording a strikeout since Ari Koufos turned the trick in a route going win over the Melrose Rams in 1992., 74755=Sat,\u00a030\u00a0May,\u00a06:00PM, at Lexington HS Andre Chiefs 5, Wakefield Merchants 1, 621629=2008, 90850=But without question, the single biggest reason for the 2008 turnaround was the re-emergence of veteran slugger Justin Crisafulli. The Chiefs captain re-established himself as an ICL force following two subpar season's by Crisafulli standards. The former Cleveland Indian hit a whopping .402 with three homers and 22 RBI's. He finished second in the ICL batting race and led the ICL in hits with 37. He ceratinly has to be considered as a serious candidate for the 2008 ICL MVP award., 174012=The Chiefs resume play on Sunday at 5:30 PM when they meet the Wakefield Merchants at Walsh Field at 5:30 PM. On Tuesday the Chiefs travel to Lexington to meet the Blue Sox at 8:00 PM., 116902=The Chiefs and Americans change venues and are right back at it tonight (Tuesday) when they square off in a 6:00 PM start at Playstead Park., 52098=With several thousand dollars in hand, John Veneziano said the league decided to put the money towards purchasing new lights for Gillis Park. After a few inquiries with Patriot Bank in Lexington, the $6,000 collected was used as a down payment toward a low-interest loan for the lights. John Veneziano said after the lights were installed in 2005, a small plaque was to go in at the park in his father\u2019s honor. But the league had another idea., 605186=Pre-Season Ends with 3-1 Loss to Americans Medford, MA- The 2008 pre-season came to a conclusion on Monday evening when the Medford Americans dealt the Chiefs a 3-1 loss at Playstead Park. Lefty Connor Bishop (Arlington, MA/Bridgewater St.) started for the Chiefs and worked a credible four innings, allowing just one run on four hits. He gave way to right-hander Jose Pimental (Bani, DR/San Diego) who surrendered two runs on three hits in two innings, including a mamouth solo home run off the bat of Americans rookie Ben Waltrip (Medford, MA/Medford) in the sixth. The Chiefs only run of the night came on a sixth inning sacrifice fly from Andrew Hanson (Cumberland, ME/Princeton). Zack Bunzell (Medford, MA/American International) picked up the pre-season pitching win for Medford. Southpaw Matt Boleski worked a 1-2-3 seventh inning for the Chiefs., 612904=As a professional, Forbes climbed\u00a0up the\u00a0ladder\u00a0in the Padres organization, eventually\u00a0setting a record for the most minor league apperances in season\u00a0with 74 in 2000. Forbes recorded almost a strikeout an inning, 209 in 214 innings, in his four year stint with the Padres., 179728=The\u00a0Bombers and Chiefs will meet\u00a0again on Monday at 6:00 PM at\u00a0Tufts University.\u00a0, 615610=Medford, MA- Pre-season began for the Chiefs on Sunday\u00a0when the Chiefs hooked up with the\u00a0Medford Americans\u00a0at\u00a0Playstead\u00a0Park.\u00a0From an original field of 77 hopefuls, 40 players are still\u00a0in the running for\u00a0one of the 26 final roster spots. Below is a tenative schedule of the Chiefs pre-season and non league contests leading up to the Intercity League opener on Tuesday, May 27. The final three games of the pre-season, a doubleheader against Lunenberg and a single game\u00a0against the Americans,\u00a0will be uniformed non league games., 370504=Lefty Dylan Ellis will draw the starting assignment tonight when the Chiefs, now 4-1, host the 4-0 Lexington Blue Sox at Tufts University at 6:00 PM., 176497=It does not get any easier for the Chiefs tonight (Tuesday) when the first place Cassell Club (11-1-1) pay a visit to Tufts University at 6:00 PM. The two teams battled to a 0-0 tie last Thursday night. Southpaw Dylan Ellis (Gloucester, MA/Merrimack) is the expected starter for the Chiefs., 608908=The Chiefs will conclude the non-league portion of the schedule on Monday when they travel to Playstead Park to take on the Americans at 5:30 PM.

Forbes signed with the Sussex of the Cam-Am League following the 2007 season where he made two starts for the New Jersey based club., 205550=Lowell, MA- Matt Cooney, who caught for the Chiefs last season, has been re-assigned by the Boston Red Sox to the Lowell Spinners of the Single A short season New York-Penn League. The Spinners open their 2008 season against the Tri-Valley Cats at LeLacheur Stadium tonight at 7:05 PM. Cooney hit .313 for the Chiefs in 2007, starting the first 13 games of the season before signing with the Red Sox in late June. He finished the 2007 campaign with the Greenville Drive where he also opened this season. The Arlington, MA native graduated from Eastern Connecticut State in the spring of 2007., 85715=2009, 52803=On May 29, Morse will emcee the North Medford Little League\u2019s Legends of the League gala, a night to honor the people who have dedicated their time and effort to the league. Veneziano will be the organization\u2019s first honoree at what the league hopes will be an annual event., 185700=The Blue Sox went ahead 1-0 in the first and threatened for much more. Holy Cross leadoff man Jack Laurendeau got things going with a single to right and Curley followed with a perfectly placed bunt single in front of the plate. Dan Graham then hit a deep fly to center on which Laurendeau tagged and went to third. With Boston College's cleanup man Jared McGuire at the plate, a pitch got by catcher Matt Lawlor allowing Laurendeau to score. Pimentel then\u00a0walked both McGuire and Anthony Santos to reload the bases. The Chiefs averted further trouble when Ben Hewett bounced into a Brenden Shepard unassisted to Koslowski doubleplay. The Chiefs tried to knot things up in the home half of the first but came up empty. Pyburn led off with a single to right and Nate Leva sacrificed him to second. Hewett bore down and got Andrew Hanson looking at strike three and Crisafulli to bounce to third on a nice\u00a0effort by Curley who ranged behind the bag to make the play. The Sox went up two zip in the second inning. Pimentel got Dan Haugh swinging but John Lerner and Coscia hit back to back singles before Laurendeau\u00a0K'd for the second out. Curley then doubled just inside the right field line scoring Lerner and putting runners on second and third. Graham was intentionally walked and Pimentel got McGuire to fly to Phil Costello in right to end the inning. The Chiefs went down quietly in the both the second and third innings and Pimentel settled\u00a0 down nicely to retire the sides in order in the Lexington third and fourth. The Chiefs tried to make some noise in the fourth when Crisafulli\u00a0led off and reached on an infield single.\u00a0\u00a0Kolowski then lofted a long fly ball that was tracked down by Graham on the warning track in right. Shepard then hit a pea right at Lerner at second base and when Andre followed with a long single to left center the Chiefs had two runners aboard. Hewett again got tough when he had to and got Lawlor to groundout to shortstop to end the inning. Pimentel\u00a0got the Lexington side in order in the fifth and the Chiefs returned the favor by going 1-2-3 in the bottom of the inning. The Blue Sox threatened to blow it open in the top of the sixth when Jett Nolet walked and went to second on a wild pitch. Pimentel got Ben Hewett to fly out and the Chiefs chose to intentionally walk the right handed hitting Haugh to put runners on first and second. Koslowski came on to face lefties Lerner and Coscia and got a pop up and a nice play on a grounder\u00a0to Shepard to keep it a 2-0 game. A Crisafulli single was all the Chiefs could muster in the sixth and Koslowski kept the Sox off the board in the top of the seventh. In the bottom of the inning, Hewett got Andre for the first out when he flew to center. Lawlor then singled and Nicky Dunn ran for him. Pinch hitter Matt Anderson made things interesting when he lined a single to right to put runners on the corners with one\u00a0out. Pyburn followed with a RBI grounder to Nolet at first scoring Dunn and moving Mike Barbati, who had run for Anderson to second. That's where the Chiefs rally ended as Hewett struck out Doug Heald swinging to end the game. Pimentel worked 5.1 innings and allowed two earned runs on five hits while striking out seven and issuing four base on balls. Koslowski went 1.2 innings and gave up two hits anfd struck out a batter. The Chiefs begin an important home and home series with the Testa Corp. Bombers at East Boston Stadium on Sunday at 5:30 PM before both teams travel back to Tufts for a rematch on Monday\u00a0evening at 6:00 PM., 171511=Wakefield, MA- In a season that has seen an unusual number of games ending in a tie, the Chiefs managed to turn the trick for the fifth time in just eighteen games, playing the Wakefield Merchants to a 4-4 standoff at Walsh Field on Sunday.

It stayed that way until the bottom of the ninth. Hughes led off and drew a full count walk. With Matt Gedman at the plate, Hughes advanced to second on a passed ball. Gedman then hit a hard shot labled for right field but Chiefs first baseman Paul Koslowski made a nice diving stop and just beat Gedman to the bag with Hughes going to third. Ellis then got pinch hitter Eric Poling to bounce back to him for the second out of the inning. Jack Laurendeau followed and won it for the Blue Sox when he hit a sharp grounder down the first base line.

It will be remembered as the\u00a0year the franchise regained some ICL prominence after two seasons of being a virtual expansion team and sporting the only two sub .500 records in team history. The team rediscovered its winning ways and\u00a0battled into the ICL playoffs for the 44th time in 46 seasons. The Chiefs completed the regular ICL season with a 17-8-6 record\u00a0to go along with\u00a0a 3-1 non-league mark, and pretty much had a battle on thier hands every night, win, lose or tie., 195502=Monday's\u00a0scheduled game against the\u00a0Medford Americans was postponed due to heavy rain showers. The Chiefs and Americans will try again on Tuesday at Tufts at 6:00 PM.

You can then add star lefty Dylan Ellis, who was sensational all year at age 20, and rookie reserves Alex Fisher and Nicky Leva, who are just 18 to the list.

Franklin Pierce star Matt Anderson was able to play in only 14 games and his season ended in mid July when a knee injury put him on the shelf. He is expected to be healthy and bring a big bat to the 2009 lineup. Koslowski and Andre battled leg injuries during the season with both of them playing through it as best as possible. In fact, Andre started all 37 games for the Chiefs before finally being forced out of the lineup in the fourth inning of Sunday's game. Koslowski did his best Kurt Gibson impression on August\u00a05 when he hobbled around the bases after hitting a huge pinch hit home run that broke a 4-4 tie and propelled the Chiefs to an important\u00a0win over the Americans., 176175=Following Tuesday's game, the Chiefs will enjoy the traditional ICL Fourth of July mid season break.

Following a stint in the Netherlands, where he pitched a couple of seasons in the Dutch Major League, Garcia returned to his native Domincan Republic where he continued his professional career in Dominican Winter League. In 2003 his career took him north of the border where he pitched for Saskatoon of the Canadian League before returning to the Domincan League for the last few seasons. Despite his long pro resume, the imposing 6' 5 southpaw is just 27 years old., 488159=Woburn, MA- Right-handed ace Keith Forbes picked up where he left off last season with six innings of dominating pitching, \u00a0propelling the Chiefs to their third straight win, 8-1 over the Mooney Dental Tanners on Sunday night at Ferullo Field.\u00a0 Forbes, who was making his first start of the young season, led the ICL in 2007 with 79 K\u2019s. The former San Diego Padre allowed just three hits in an 87 pitch effort, while striking out seven. The only run he surrendered was of the unearned variety in the sixth inning. \u00a0 The Tanners Joe Curran (Arlington, MA/Southern Maine) matched blanks with Forbes for two innings before the Chiefs broke through with four \"twilight aided\" runs in the top of the third. With one out, Angel Valdez reached on an infield error. Andrew Hanson remained red hot with his second single of the night to right. Cleanup man Justin Crisafulli then popped out for the inning\u2019s second out. Mike Andre then came to the plate and delivered a RBI single to center scoring Valdez and giving the Chiefs a 1-0 lead. The twilight sky then came into play as Matt Anderson lofted what seemed to be an inning ending fly ball to short right field. The ball was lost in the dusk and fell for a two RBI double, allowing both Hanson and Andre to score making it 3-0. D\u00e9ja vu when the next batter up Phil Costello hit a fly ball to center that was also lost in the tough sky, dropping for a RBI single and a 4-0 Chiefs lead. The Chiefs added two more runs in the fifth to take a 6-0 lead. Nate Leva beat out a perfect bunt to get things going and Brendan Pyburn singled to left center putting runners on the corners with nobody out. Valdez lofted a sacrifice fly to center easily scoring Leva with the Chiefs fifth run. Hanson, who is hitting a league leading .727 (8-11), rapped his third consecutive single moving Pyburn to third. Crisafulli plated Pyburn with a RBI infield grounder. Forbes meanwhile went sailing through the first four innings before tiring a bit in the fifth and sixth. He pitched out of a bases loaded jam in the fifth, when runners reached on an error by first baseman Paul Koslowski, a single and a walk, by getting Bentley College star Kevin Vona to ground out. He allowed a run in the sixth when Ryan Doyle reached on an error at shortstop by Brenden Shepard and scored on a RBI double off the bat of Andrew Worden. \u00a0 The Chiefs made it an 8-1 game with two runs in the seventh on singles from Anderson, Koslowski and Leva.\u00a0 Joe Martini came on to pitch a scoreless seventh inning in his Chiefs debut, allowing one hit and striking out a batter., 141035=The Chiefs, now 10-7-5, return to action on Thursday when they host the Watertown Reds at Tufts University starting at 6:00 PM.

As a\u00a0virtual expansion team, with only veterans Justin Crisafulli and Dave Marsters left from the glory days of the 1990's and early 2000's, the Chiefs fielded their youngest team ever. They struggled mightily in 2006, posting a franshise worst 7-20-1 record and missing the ICL playoffs for the first time since 1958. Although the club showed marked improvement last season, a late season tailspin knocked them out of contention in late July and they finished with a less than stellar 9-18-5 mark., 605925=Lunenberg\u00a0hurlers limited the\u00a0Chiefs to\u00a0just four hits in\u00a0the first game, singles from\u00a0Andre, Valdez, Leva and\u00a0Matt Boleski.

Foundas, who has served as the Chiefs closer over the last two years making 26 appearances, was 3-3 in his final year at Bryant while moving into the Bulldogs starting rotation. Foundas started eight games for Bryant and threw 41.0 innings.\u00a0He was\u00a0named to the ICL all-star team in 2008., 116363=Medford, MA- Ailing veteran Paul Koslowski drilled a pinch hit solo home run leading off the sixth inning, breaking a 4-4 tie, and propelling the Chiefs to a darkness shortened 6-4 win over the Medford Americans at Playstead Park on Tuesday evening. Lefty Dylan Ellis survived a rocky four run third inning to stay unbeaten in seven 2008 decisions., 93431=Others like Connor Bishop and Nicky Dunn were very valuable assets to the 2008 team. Bishop, in his third season is also 20 years old. The Arlington lefty\u00a0saw only limited action on the mound, but came up huge in a winning relief effort against Cassell in July. Dunn, another rookie from Salem State, is a gifted athlete and did anything needed to help the team, from pinch running, to catching, to playing second base, as well as all three outfield spots., 602937=Note: Tuesday Night's Scheduled Opener was Postponed -Rain Medford, MA- The Chiefs will send ace right-hander Keith Forbes to the mound on Tuesday evening when they open their 2008 Intercity League campaign against the Mooney Dental Tanners of Woburn.
