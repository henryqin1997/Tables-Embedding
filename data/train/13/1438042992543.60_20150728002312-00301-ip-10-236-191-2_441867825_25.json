            "ORGANIC LIGHT EMITTING DISPLAY APPARATUS AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURING THE SAME - An organic light emitting display apparatus includes pixel electrodes formed on a substrate for respective pixels. Auxiliary electrodes are formed on at least parts of the periphery of the pixel electrodes. A first organic function layer is formed on the substrate and covers the pixel electrodes and the auxiliary electrodes. An emissive layer is formed on the first organic function layer for the respective pixels. A second organic function layer is formed on the substrate and covers the emissive layer. A cathode electrode is formed on the entire substrate and faces the pixel electrodes and covers the second organic function layer. Secondary cathode electrodes are formed, on at least parts of the auxiliary electrodes, in contact with the cathode electrode through a contact hole.",
            "ORGANIC LIGHT EMITTING DISPLAY APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING THE SAME - An organic light emitting display apparatus includes a plurality of first electrodes disposed in each of a plurality of pixels on a substrate, a plurality of lower auxiliary electrodes insulated from the first electrodes and in which the lower auxiliary electrodes are disposed in a first direction, an organic layer disposed on the first electrodes, and a second electrode facing the first electrodes and covering the organic layer. The second electrode is disposed on substantially an entire surface of the substrate. The organic light emitting display apparatus further includes a plurality of upper auxiliary electrodes disposed on the second electrode in a second direction."
