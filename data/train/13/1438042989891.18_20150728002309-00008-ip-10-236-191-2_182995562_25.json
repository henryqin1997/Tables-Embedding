    "textAfterTable": "$2.40 $8.00 / $27.00 Two children (438 responses) $18.40 $19.00 $2.60 $8.00 / $30.00 Three children (114 responses) $23.70 $24.00 $5.10 $13.00 / $36.00 Notes: Hourly rates that were well outside the average appear to be cases where the nanny is paid a flat rate regardless of how many children are present. For example, the $27.00/hr rate for one child was a case where the nanny was caring for the family's three children, and would be paid the three-child rate even if only one of the children was present. As with previous BPN surveys, some people mis-read the question and provided only their share of the nanny's rate for 2 and 3 children. We assumed this was the case if the 2-child or 3-child rate was LESS THAN the 1-child rate. In this case we multiplied the rate by 2 or 3 to get the total. (This was not done where the 1-child rate EQUALLED the 2 or 3 child rate. In nearly all these cases, the nanny was caring for the children of only one family, so she was being paid the same rate regardless of how many children were present.) Weekly Rates 9.
