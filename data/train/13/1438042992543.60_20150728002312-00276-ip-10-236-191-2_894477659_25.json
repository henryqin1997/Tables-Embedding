            "Hendrix College is an excellent choice for students wanting to challenge their academic abilities. The faculty and staff here are always friendly and welcoming. The college has a very active student life, and getting involved is never a challenge here."

This doesn't just makes the parties and dances more interesting; it allows for students to get more attention from teachers as well as support for special events like drama performances and concerts. It's also a great environment for finding study partners because you know everyone in your classes, which are relatively small, not just the person sitting next to you. Also, there is little to no discrimination for sexual orientation, race, etc. What discrimination that may be felt is suppressed by those who feel it or is slowly transformed into acceptance. It's a great place to be no matter who you are., 157849=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 131508=Take. A. Campus. Tour. From what I'd seen online and heard from other people, Hendrix didn't really appeal to me very much. But, I happened to be in Conway on a long weekend and decided to schedule a spur-of-the-moment campus visit, I fell in love with the place. Also, apply for as much financial aid as you can. You'll need it; they told me on my tour that the estimated cost of attendance in 2013 was $52,000 (tuition, room and board, fees, books, living expenses).}",

Tips for prospective students Apply for every scholarship you can find if money is an issue; especially if it's the final factor in whether or not you choose Hendrix. The money is worth it. Take the ACT as many times as it takes to get a 32 because then you've basically paid for college if you can keep up your grades. Bang for the buck Hendrix costs a pretty penny. All in all, the money is worth it. The community helps to promote growth academically and socially. There are a lot of community activities to attend like dances, concerts and parties; paid for by the student senate using your student activities fee. The teachers all know your names and faces and",
