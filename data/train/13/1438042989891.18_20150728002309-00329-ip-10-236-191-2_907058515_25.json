            "dooley's week: the unofficial mascot goes around campus and lets out class if the professor cannot answer a question correctly.",
            "i feel like i'm getting so much free stuff here at emory that it is definitely worth the money and more. the clash of culture, new foods, exciting music, free t-shirts, ipad raffles, and sweet opportunities to meet famous people are just some of the perks of being an emory eagle.",
            "run through the quad, go to frat row, go to lenox mall, explore little five points or virginia highlands.",
            "freshmen get unlimited swipes at and an additional $150 per semester to spend at any of the many restaurants on campus, including starbucks, pizza hut, freshens smoothies, and chik-fil-a. dining at dobbs does have a lot of options including a vegan station but it closes at 8pm.",
            "students are guaranteed housing for the first two years. freshmen dorms are luxurious hotel-style with private bathrooms and semi-suites. new dorms are constantly being built. sophomore housing is also conveniently located near central campus and some even have parking lots for student use.",
            "emory has some top professors, especially in the economics department and the business school. classes are fun and challenging. if you get into emory, you should not have a problem keeping up the curriculum of the classes.",
            "don't miss the fall and spring band parties where the hottest artists hold private (and free) concerts for all emory students (plus lots of free stuff). dip your toes in new activities as there are over 300 clubs and organizations to join.",
            "emory is surprisingly the perfect grounds for culturing new ideas. even though it doesn't have a football team, emory is still high in spirit and makes up for it in swimming and soccer. above all, emory is the perfect combination of nature-esque suburbia and busy city since it is only ten minutes away from central atlanta."

Also, plan ahead (say your junior year); don't wait to do any research in October of your senior year. Have steady academics and a lot of extracurriculars-not just a 4.0 will get you in., 449688=Emory University is an excellent institution with a close-knit student community. Offering challenging course loads, hands-on learning, and enough coffee shops to keep you awake through your 8:30, this is the place to be. Emory gives me all of the tools I need to succeed in college and beyond., 67183=It's a high-priced institution and keeps getting pricier since tuition is being raised for the year 2012-13. Though it is highly expensive, the institution has a huge endowment and if you are in need, Emory will usually give you a grant that covers most or all of the tuition. There is also Emory Scholars program that caters to students who have excelled in a particular area of study. Those students also receive grants. Emory is a little overpriced but they mostly make up for it with all of the on-campus resources they provide., 241934=Dooley is a legendary figure unique to Emory, representing the academic nature of our campus along with the rich tradition present among our student body. Dooley the skeleton is Emory'\u00c2?s second mascot, the \u00c2?Lord of Misrule\u00c2? who makes an appearance at every major Emory event - \u00c2?Songfest, Diwali, Homecoming, President Carter'\u00c2?s Town Hall meeting - accompanied by an elite group of five or six students. Dooley\u00c3?\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3?\u00c2?\u00c3?\u00c2?s appearance is always succeeded by a chant: Presidents may come, presidents may go; professors may come, professors may go; students may come, students may go; but Dooley lives forever! Dooley is honored by his own week in the spring, complete with the Taste of Emory festival, Emory Trivia night, Dooley'\u00c2?s Ball, a huge dance party on McDonough Field, and Spring Band party. His power even extends so far as to let students out of class during his week -\u00c2? if he and his entourage enter the classroom and ask an Emory trivia question of which the teacher can'\u00c2?t correctly answer, the class is freed. Another time-honored tradition at Emory is Songfest. Songfest is an orientation activity for freshman: led by Resident Advisors and Sophomore Advisors, each freshman dorm performs songs and dances in competition with one another for the title of Songfest champions. The RAs and SAs change the lyrics of popular songs, making them reverent of their specific dorm and condescending of all other dorms. For example, in 2011, Longstreet Means transposed the lyrics of Miley Cyrus's \u00c2?Party in the USA\u00c2? to promote LSM: And so I put my Ls up/Harris, goodbye/It really isn'\u00c2?t your day/Yeah, it'\u00c2?s a party in LSM., 479571=If you are planning to come here, try leaving July free because there are summer courses you can take and learn about campus and make friends., 336920=Some get tired of the food in the main dining hall, the DUC, by October. All the resources for adding some variety are there, though - you just have to take the initiative (YouTube 'Teach Me How to DUC It)! Also, freshman meal plans come with 300 or 500 Dooley Dollars that you can spend in 20+ locations around campus. Finally, Emory has a student-led food committee that modifies things; for example, this semester the dining hours changed, and they instituted a Wednesday night Premium entree that looks like a 5-star restaurant dish for a meal swipe and 7 Dooley Dollars., 71975=Atlanta can get really hot and muggy in August and September. Freshman orientation is in August and it can get incredibly brutal out there. Dress accordingly. Also, it is a good idea to research majors that interest you beforehand so you'll know which classes you need to take for your major. You don't want to run out of time and not be able to complete your major requirements or general education requirements. Oh, and always visit the school before you enroll. You need to feel it out and make sure it's the right place for you., 326322=An Emory education opens so many doors, but like any highly ranked school, it\u00e2??s only worth the investment if you take advantage of the opportunities that are given to you. It\u00e2??s a degree you have to work hard for, and that can take you many places if you take your education into your own hands, and make connections while at school. Emory\u00e2??s definitely not cheap, so be sure to fill out the FAFSA even if you\u00e2??re not sure you\u00e2??ll get any financial aid. Also, look out for scholarships that Emory and Oxford provide to incoming students. Many of these scholarships are due in November/December of your senior year so look out for them!, 20071=As one of the nation's top private universities, choosing Emory isn't always the most economical option. Emory's official 2011-2012 annual Tuition and Costs clocks in at between $50,000-60,000, a hefty sum. However, all is not lost. The university does take into account need-based financial aid, and offers loans to those who need it. Additionally, the competitive Emory Scholars program offers the brightest prospective students the opportunity to attend the university virtually for free, and they have preference when choosing classes. Also, Emory has a very active career center, whose staff is constantly reaching out to students and provide valuable resources for internships, scholarships, and part time jobs for the semester and the summer. For those who qualify, there are also work-study jobs, which give students on-campus part time work, usually at a rate above minimum wage. While Emory is a major financial investment for its students and their families, if you are determined to attend this university, they can help make it happen. It doesn't work out in every case, but as the saying goes, when there's a will, there's a way., 151712=Emory is one of 25 colleges and universities named a \u201cNew Ivy by Kaplan/Newsweek\u2019s in 2007. Expect the academic rigor to challenge and stretch your worldview. Want the challenge., 534314=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students While good grades and high standardized test scores are important to admission into a good college, much more is necessary to secure a spot in the incoming freshmen class. Emory puts a lot of emphasis on diversifying its student population, and so it is imperative that you show how and why you stand out from the thousands of applicants. Emory also seems to care about how much you want to attend the school. They want to see your passion and determination. And so, be sure to convey this message well in your essays. I say this because many students that were wait listed at Emory were finally admitted because they sent in letters saying how much they want to go to Emory. If you show that you are qualified and that you really want to attend Emory, there is probably nothing that will stand between you and your acceptance letter. Bang for the buck Unfortunately, like all other top tier private schools, Emory's tuition is phenomenally high. However, the high costs of attending this college are well worth it, mainly for the reasons stated above. Not only are you receiving a high class education, there's a lot of fun available all around you. Not all schools in the same tier can say the same thing. From outstanding professors to high rated advisors to surprisingly small classes,",
