For example, a title insurance company may limit the territory for which they will write policies, requiring exclusionary rules to prevent that company's title insurance from being offered to a customer who does not reside in the territory. Once the exclusionary rules have been applied to the cross-sell products and/or services, a list of eligible products and/or services is generated 1012 by identifying the products that are both applicable to the customer, and for which the customer is eligible based on the exclusionary rules. This list is preferably displayed to the customer, allowing the customer to select services as desired. Where the cross-sell information is presented to the customer via the Internet, a more robust version of the above process can generate products and/or services requests to providers chosen by the customer by hyperlink, for example, as well as by ordering through the offeror. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that certain reporting tools may be used in conjunction with the present invention, and, specifically, with the cross-sell aspects of the present invention. For example, the data generated in the process of the present invention may be used to generate sales leads for sale to third parties, and may allow for tracking of the results of, for example, advertising., 121704=[0088] The cross-selling of products is shown generically in FIG. 3 as block 364. FIG. 9 shows the process in greater detail. Once it has been determined that the customer is eligible to receive a deal option, the system may query 1002 the customer whether the customer desires to be offered products and services related to the requested deal structuring, or the system may offer such additional products without querying the customer. The DSS 100 then applies 1006 product applicability rules to the products listed in the database of products and services to identify 1008 applicable products and/or services for cross-selling to the customer. For example, if the customer is purchasing a new construction home, the services of a termite inspector are likely not needed, and should not be offered. If information in the deal structuring discloses that the customer will make a long-distance move to occupy the new property, the DSS system 100 might offer insurance for the goods in transit., 66878=[0014] This application is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/586,462, filed Jun. 3, 2000, which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth herein in its entirety., 139155=[0138] In addition to providing the customer with multiple loan options, the present invention may add a reduced term option for the customer. In the case of a mortgage, these reduced term options may be identified to the consumer as beneficial, such as by way of an explanation, by a showing of the savings that the shorter mortgage term would supply. For example, if the customer had ten years remaining at $800 a month, and the reduced term offer would be for five years at $1500 a month, the client would save $6,000. This is calculated as ($800*120months)\u2212($1500*60months)., 171243=[0162] Once a product is identified for which the customer is eligible, the system generates a stipulations list for that product. The list is generated by applying the Stipulations rules to the information contained in the deal structuring record. The list of stipulations generated can be displayed on a user interface, as shown on FIG. 10. Once the user has identified 1102 the loan product for which he or she is interested in reviewing the stipulations, the user may, for example, select a \u201cStipulations\u201d tab 1104, causing the stipulations to be displayed 1106 in a window below the product list., 59198=[0001] This application is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/586,462, filed Jun. 3, 2000.}",
