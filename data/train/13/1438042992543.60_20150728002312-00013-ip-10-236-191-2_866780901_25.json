    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{78656=The Bears returned home to AT&T Park in search of their first conference win against the Trojans, who they had not beaten since 2003. On the fourth play of the game a Keenan Allen fumble was recovered by the Trojans, but they were unable to convert it into points, when a trick play called by USC head coach Lane Kiffin on fourth down at the Cal 8-yard line resulted in a fumble that Cal recovered. A second Cal fumble was recovered by the Trojans when Zach Maynard was sacked in Cal territory, setting up a 39-yard field goal. USC scored three times in the second quarter, first on a 39-yard pass by Matt Barkley to receiver Marqise Lee. Maynard was then intercepted on the Cal 23 on the ensuing possession to set up a 29-yard field goal, and receiver Brandon Carswell had a 7-yard reception late in the quarter. The Bears were able to drive downfield in the final minutes of the half but failed to get on the board when Maynard was intercepted at the goal line. USC led 20\u20130 at the half, with Cal being shut out for four straight quarters going back to the previous week against Oregon., 18422=Following the program's first losing season during Jeff Tedford's tenure as head coach, several coaching changes were implemented. Offensive coordinator Andy Ludwig departed for the same position at in San Diego State. He was replaced by Jim Michalczik, who will also be the offensive line coach due to the departure of Steve Marshall for Colorado. Michalczik had previously been the offensive line coach at Cal from 2002\u20132008. Wide receivers coach Kevin Daft was succeeded by Eric Kiesau, who will also function as the passing game coordinator, while defensive backs coach Al Simmons was succeeded by Ashley Ambrose, who held the same position at Colorado. Marcus Arroyo joined the coaching staff as quarterbacks coach and assistant head coach., 19842=Starting running back Shane Vereen, who finished the 2010 season with 1,167 yards to become the program's first 1,000-yard rusher since the 2008 season, decided to forego a remaining season of eligibility and enter the NFL Draft, having graduated in December. He was drafted in the second round by the New England Patriots, following defensive end Cameron Jordan, who was drafted in the first round. Safety Chris Conte was selected in the third round by the Chicago Bears, and linebacker Mike Mohamed was picked in the sixth round by the Denver Broncos., 88032=The first conference game between the two teams was their first matchup since the 2009 Poinsettia Bowl. After a scoreless first quarter Cal's first points of the game came in the second with a 5-yard scoring run by Isi Sofele. A fumble by Utah quarterback Jon Hays was recovered and resulted in a 35-yard field goal. After the Bears made a 37-yard field goal, Hays was picked off by linebacker Mychal Kendricks which set up a 12-yard touchdown reception by Keenan Allen to make it 20\u20130 at the half. Quarterback Zach Maynard scored on a 4-yard run in the third quarter, while a second interception of Hays set up a 29-yard field goal attempt which missed. Hays threw his third interception of the game to open the fourth quarter, which was returned by Josh Hill for a 32-yard score. The Utes ended their scoring drought with a 36-yard field goal on the ensuing possession and running back John White had a 14-yard touchdown run in the final minutes., 128774=Zach Maynard threw for 188 yards and was picked off once and sacked six times, accounting for three turnovers. Isi Sofele was held to 52 rushing yards with one touchdown run, while Marvin Jones and Keenan Allen logged 88 and 82 yards through the air, respectively. Cal committed five turnovers, the most since the October 29 matchup against UCLA. Texas quarterback David Ash threw for 142 yards and a score and was sacked twice, but earned Offensive MVP honors. Receiver Marquise Goodwin had 49 yards through the air and 33 on the ground with a touchdown reception, as the Longhorns outrushed the Bears 109\u20137, giving Cal their lowest single-game rushing total since 2000.[30] Linebacker Keenan Robinson was named the Defensive MVP., 127069=Cal had last played Texas in 1970, and the Longhorns owned a 4\u20130 record against the Bears, although this marked their first meeting in a bowl.[28] Cal scored first on a 47-yard field goal, then committed its first turnover of the game when Zach Maynard was intercepted by cornerback Quandre Diggs. Despite a defensive stop, Maynard was sacked on the following possession and fumbled deep in Cal territory. However Texas was unable to capitalize on this when a 38-yard field goal missed. The Longhorns got on the board midway through the second quarter on a trick play that involved receiver Jaxon Shipley throwing a 4-yard touchdown pass to quarterback David Ash to make it 7\u20133 at the half, the combined score tying a Holiday Bowl record for lowest ever in the first half.[29], 12995=Due to reconstruction at California Memorial Stadium, California played their home games in AT&T Park in San Francisco, California.[1] The season opener against Fresno State, officially a neutral-site game, was played at Candlestick Park.[2] The regular season also ended with an away game with a matchup at Arizona State on November 25., 71810=Zach Maynard passed for 349 yards and a touchdown, the first time a Cal quarterback had passed for 300 yards since October 2009.[20] Keenan Allen had a career-high 197 yards with a score, while Isi Sofele had 98 yards on the ground. Keith Price threw for 292 yards with three touchdowns, while Chris Polk was the Huskies' leading receiver and rusher, with 85 and 60 yards, respectively, scoring both through the air and on the ground., 21002=The team held its spring football from March 15 to April 24. Junior transfer Zach Maynard, the half brother of wide receiver Keenan Allen, was named the starting quarterback on May 14.[4] Maynard had played at Buffalo from 2008\u20132009 before transferring to Cal in 2010., 55888=Cal won the coin toss and elected to play defense to start overtime. Colorado drove to the 4-yard line before settling for a 22-yard field goal. After reaching a first down at the 15-yard line, Cal was pushed back to the 35-yard line by two penalties, setting up a 1st-and-30 situation. However, on first down Maynard connected with Keenan Allen for a 32-yard gain to the 3-yard line. One play later, Maynard passed to Allen for a 5-yard touchdown to give the Bears their first overtime win since 2006. The victory tied head coach Jeff Tedford with Andy Smith for the most in school history with 74.[18], 54068=Although both teams are in the Pac-12, this game counts as a non-conference game in Pac-12 standings, as it was scheduled before Colorado joined the Pac-12. The Bears visited Boulder for the first time since 1982,[18] where they were shut out during the first quarter by the Buffaloes. Zach Maynard was intercepted on Cal's second possession of the game to set up a Colorado 27-yard field goal. However Cal got on the board to open the second quarter on a 2-yard pass from Maynard to fulback Nico Dumont, although a PAT was blocked for the second week in a row. After both teams traded field goals, Cal added to its lead on a 7-yard pass from Maynard to tight end Anthony Miller to make it 16\u20136 at the half., 106817=Cal's final home game of the season was a matchup against Oregon State, who they had not beaten at home since 1997.[27] The Beavers scored first on the opening drive with a 32-yard field goal and had an opportunity to add to their score when Zach Maynard was picked off on the ensuing possession, but were forced to punt. The Bears responded with a 19-yard strike from Maynard to receiver Michael Calvin to take the lead, which was never relinquished. They added to the lead on a nine-minute scoring drive in the second quarter that was capped off by a 5-yard run by Maynard. With a minute left in the half, Oregon State was able to drive down the field and kick a 46-yard field goal to cut the lead to 14\u20136., 13963=Following the team's first losing season during Tedford's tenure as head coach, the Golden Bears improved to 7\u20135 (4\u20135 in the Pac-12) to finish fourth in the North Division. Cal also became bowl-eligible for the first time since 2009 and accepted a bid to play in the Holiday Bowl, which they lost to Texas. With a victory against Presbyterian on September 17, Tedford became the winningest coach in program history.[3], 132160=Defensive line coach Tosh Lupoi, who had been with the program for twelve years, and wide receivers coach Eric Kiesau, who had joined the program just that year, both left to join the Washington coaching staff in mid January 2012.[32][33] Coach and former NFL wide receiver Wes Chandler succeeded Kiesau on January 18.[34] Coach and former NFL linebacker Todd Howard was named as Lupoi's replacement after having fulfilled the same role at Washington State the previous season.[35], 80368=Zach Maynard threw for 294 yards and had a touchdown run, but accounted for four of the Bears' turnovers with three interceptions and a fumble. Keenan Allen had a career high 160 receiving yards, while Isi Sofele, coming off a breakout game the previous week against Oregon, was held to 44 yards on the ground. Cal committed five turnovers for the first time since November 2008 and went 0\u20133 in conference play for the first time in Jeff Tedford's tenure as head coach.[22] Matt Barkley threw for 195 yards and two scores while Curtis McNeal led the Trojans on the ground with 86 yards and a score, while Marquise Lee had 81 yards through the air and a touchdown., 133288=In the 2012 NFL Draft, six Cal players were selected, the most out of any Pac-12 school. Linebacker Mychal Kendricks and offensive tackle Mitchell Schwartz were taken in the second round, punter Bryan Anger in the third, receiver Marvin Jones in the fifth, and safety D. J. Campbell and defensive end Trevor Guyton in the seventh. Anger became the highest drafted punter since 1995.[36], 69942=In the conference opener for both teams, Cal faced Washington in Seattle, not having defeated the Huskies since 2008. On the Bears' opening possession Zach Maynard connected with receiver Keenan Allen for a 90-yard score, the longest reception in school history.[20] Washington responded on the ensuing possession on a 20-yard touchdown reception by tight end Austin Seferian-Jenkins from Keith Price. The Huskies scored again on a 2-yard run by running back Chris Polk to take the lead, which they never relinquished. After the Bears opened the second quarter with a 29-yard field goal, the Huskies scored their third straight touchdown with a 20-yard reception by Seferian-Jenkins. After Cal scored with a 36-yard field goal, a fumble by Price was recovered by the Bears. This set up a 1-yard score by running back C.J. Anderson for the final points of the half. A 52-yard field goal attempt by Washington's Erik Folk missed to close out the half, with the Huskies leading 21\u201320., 108203=Zach Maynard threw for 128 yards, with one passing touchdown and a rushing touchdown. Isi Sofele set a new career high with 190 yards rushing and had a touchdown, also going over the 1,000 yard mark for the season. Oregon State's Sean Mannion passed for 247 yards with two interceptions, while the Beavers' ground attack was held to only 27 yards, their second-fewest total of the season. The victory snapped a four-game losing streak to Oregon State going back to 2006 and made Cal bowl-eligible for the eighth time in nine-year after finishing the previous season with a 5\u20137 record.[27], 44043=In his first start for the Bears, Zach Maynard passed for 266 yards, with two touchdowns and an interception, while running for 53 yards. Starting running back Isi Sofele scored the second rushing touchdown of his career and rushed for 83 total yards. Keenan Allen had 112 yards receiving, while Marvin Jones had 118, with two touchdowns, marking the first time two Cal receivers had 100 yards in a game since 2006.[2] For Fresno State, Derek Carr passed for 142 yards, a touchdown and an interception, while Robbie Rouse had 86 rushing yards, with a touchdown., 41662=The third meeting between Cal and Fresno State was a neutral-site game played at Candlestick Park in San Francisco. It saw both quarterbacks each start their first career games for their respective teams: Cal's Zach Maynard had transferred from Buffalo in 2010, while Fresno State's Derek Carr had redshirted the previous season. On the opening drive Maynard's first pass was intercepted on the Cal 16-yard line and Fresno State was able to score first on a 9-yard run by running back Robbie Rouse. However the Bears were able to rebound. Their second possession saw a 67-yard scoring drive put together which was capped off with a 1-yard touchdown run by running back Isi Sofele, although the PAT was blocked. On their third possession of the game, Sofele was able to break free for a 39-yard run, but the PAT was blocked again. The Bears scored for a third time on their fourth possession when Maynard connected with wide receiver Marvin Jones for a 42-yard score. The Bulldogs had a chance to add some points at the beginning of the second quarter, but a 35-yard field goal missed. The Fresno State defense was able to keep Cal scoreless, and with Cal backed up on its own 6-yard line, were able to capitalize on a botched snap that Sofele tried to recover in the Cal end zone, but was knocked lose for a fumble and recovered by the Bulldogs for a touchdown. This trimmed Cal's lead to 19\u201314 at the half., 12378=The 2011 California Golden Bears football team represented the University of California, Berkeley in the 2011 NCAA Division I FBS football season. Led by tenth-year head coach Jeff Tedford, the Bears are members of the North Division of the Pacific-12 Conference.}",
