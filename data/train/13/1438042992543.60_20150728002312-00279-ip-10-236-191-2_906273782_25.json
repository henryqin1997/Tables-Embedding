I plan on joining Catholic Campus Ministries, Student Activities Council Residence Hall Association and possibly AFROTC. I am really excited to be a freshman!, 327056=I wouldn't recommend Towers East to any freshmen, because they have too many fire alarms that go off, typically late at night like 1 o'clock, 3 o'clock in the morning which isn't cool. But if by chance that's what you can afford at the moment go for it. Vandiver, Myers, Merick, New Hall, and Towers North are really nice! I highly recommend them!, 70033=There are so many good instructors at SEMO. You will learn quickly who to take from the ratemyinstructor website and also from all your friends you meet here. I plan on entering the competitive nursing program in Spring 2013. Till then, most of the instructors know how strict to be in order to get the important things in your head which will help you and not to worry about the pointless information you don't need. (I didn't take math at SEMO) I highly recommend trying to test out of developmental en classes and the alecs program (math). I've only heard bad things about them, they are a waste of your money because a lot of people who took it failed., 230641=There are tons of student organizations. These organizations have a lot of events too. They even try to raise money for charity. Some of the events I have been too are Halloween party's, Carpe Demi, a masquerade ball, and some charity's include rely for life or march of dimes., 249302=Every year on campus around October, there is a game called Zombie tag. This is a campus wide game and is very fun to play. Also, there is a Dance Marathon every year for charity that is very awarding to participate in., 366304=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Tips for prospective students You should come and visit before you make a decision on any college. Bang for the buck Southeast Missouri State University, in my opinion, is very reasonable about pricing. Their tuition is much cheaper than many other schools in Missouri and their educational program is equal to the other schools. There are also many available majors to chose from. Am enjoying being here I enjoy being here because I like living in the dorms and I like the size of the school. Am learning a lot I am learning a lot from my classes here at",
