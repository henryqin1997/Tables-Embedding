            "TRANSMITTING SYSTEM AND METHOD THEREOF - A datagram transmitting system includes a server and a client. The client includes a first transmitting module and a detecting module. The server includes a management module and a second transmitting module. The detecting module detects whether network congestion and generates a status signal. If network is congested, the detecting module generates a first status signal. The first transmitting module transmits the status signal to the management module. The management module packages a first predetermined length of data into a datagram responding to the first status signal. The first predetermined signal is at most 65,507 bytes but more than 0 bytes in length. The second transmitting module transmits the datagram to the first transmitting module.",
            "DISC IMAGE FILE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND DISC IMAGE FILE MANAGEMENT METHOD - A disc image file management system and a disc image file method are provided. Disc image files stored in a disc image file server are transmitted from the disc image file server to a product line server according to a product schedule stored in the disc image file server. The product schedule file records time schedules for the disc image files to be transmitted to the product line server. The product line server determines whether a needed disc image file exists in the product line server, and requests the disc image file server to transmit the needed disc image file to the product line server if the needed disc image file does not exist in the product line server. The product line server transmits the needed disc image file to the client if the needed disc image file exists in the product line server."
