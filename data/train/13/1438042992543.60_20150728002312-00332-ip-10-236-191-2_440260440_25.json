Clientless cloud-computing may be implemented by detecting a plurality of input/output devices, at least a portion of the plurality of input/output devices associated with a unique identifier and available to be communicatively bound to a cloud-resident computer. A binding preference, including a selection of an input/output device, is received. The selection includes the unique identifier associated with the selected input/output device. A binding request to the selected input/output device is transmitted, and the selected input/output device is communicatively bound with the cloud-resident computer. 20130346591 Published Description Patent application number Larry D. Liu, Whitehouse Station, NJ US 06-24-2010 CATALYST AND PROCESS FOR PREPARING CARBOXYLIC ACID ESTERS - A catalyst and a process for preparing carboxylic acid esters from an aldehyde and an alcohol in the presence of molecular oxygen are disclosed. The catalyst comprises metals supported on a silica-containing support, wherein the metals consist essentially of palladium, lead, an alkali or alkaline earth metal, and at least one of niobium and zirconium. The process for preparing a carboxylic acid ester comprises reacting an aldehyde with an alcohol in the presence of molecular oxygen and the aforementioned catalyst. 20100160668 Published Description Patent application number Kindtoken Hwaider Liu, Park Ridge, NJ US 12-24-2009 1-SUBSTITUTED-3-(NAPHTHALEN-1-YLSULFONYL)-5-(PIPERAZIN-1-YL)-1H-INDAZOLE COMPOUNDS",
