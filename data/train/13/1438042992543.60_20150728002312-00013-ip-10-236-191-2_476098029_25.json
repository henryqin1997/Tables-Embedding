The maximum message threshold represents the highest total number of messages desired for the classifier to operate according to specifications. In an embodiment, the maximum message threshold is user configurable. If the total number of messages is below the maximum message threshold, processing ends. If the total number of messages is above the maximum message threshold, operation proceeds to step 1640., 230273=In step 1478, the received message is marked as a spam message and used to train statistical classifier 118., 227238=In step 1445, a determination is made whether the score generated in step 1410 indicates a high confidence that the received message is not spam. If the score indicates a high confidence that message is not spam, the score is inconsistent with the authoritative status indication and considered erroneous. Operation proceeds to step 1448. If the score does not indicate a high confidence that the message is not spam, the score is consistent with the authoritative status indication and pass processing ends. As would be readily appreciated by persons of skill in the art, the determination could be whether the score generated in step 1410 indicates a high confidence that the received message is spam., 70049=Data processing unit 1703 may also include secondary storage devices 1740 such as but not limited to hard drives 1742 or computer program product interfaces 1744. Computer program product interfaces 1744 are devices that access objects (such as information and/or software) stored in computer program products 1750. Examples of computer program product interfaces 1744 include, but are not limited to, floppy drives, CD drives, DVD drives, ZIP drives, JAZ drives, optical storage devices, etc. Examples of computer program products 1750 include, but are not limited to, floppy disks, CDs, DVDs, ZIP and JAZ disks, memory sticks, memory cards, or any other medium on which objects may be stored., 225490=In step 1430, a determination is made whether pass processing is applied to the message. Pass processing is applied when one or more of the addresses associated with the message are found on the positive screening list. If pass processing is applied, operation proceeds to step 1435. If pass processing is not applied, operation proceeds to step 1440., 192581=In step 1198, the received message is marked as a non-spam message and used to train statistical classifier 118. In this manner, statistical classifier 118 is not trained using every received message. Instead, statistical classifier 118 is only trained when an error or discrepancy is found between the authoritative status indication and the spam score., 69812=Data processing unit 1703 also includes one or more processors 1720 and a main memory 1730. Main memory 1730 may be RAM, ROM, or any other memory type, or combinations thereof., 171884=In step 1010, a signed message with a valid signature from an unknown sender (user 1) is received by user 2. As described above, the message is stored in the quarantine folder., 173106=In step 1050, user 2 (the original recipient) receives the signed response and verifies the validity of the signature. If the signature is valid, authentication data is extracted from the message (e.g., signed hash of challenge). If the authentication data was generated using one of user 2's private keys and is valid, user 2 knows that the response was received as a result of a challenge that user 2 sent. Also, user 2 can determine if the response was signed with the same private key that signed the original message. If it was, the recipient knows that the owner of that private key has control of the e-mail address that they claim to be., 225895=In step 1435, a determination is made whether the score generated in step 1410 indicates a high confidence that the received message is spam. If the score indicates a high confidence that message is spam, the score is inconsistent with the authoritative status indication and considered erroneous. Operation proceeds to step 1438. If the score does not indicate a high confidence that the message is spam, the score is consistent with the authoritative status indication and pass processing ends. As would be readily appreciated by persons of skill in the art, the determination could be whether the score generated in step 1410 indicates a high confidence that the received message is not spam., 186380=In step 1168, the addresses that are not confirmed are not included in (or are removed from) the approve/block list., 50501=The application claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd119(e) to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/616,432, filed Oct. 7, 2004, entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Filtering Messages,\u201d which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety., 191534=In an embodiment, additional steps 1197 and 1198 are performed to train statistical classifier 118. These steps are optional. Training of statistical classifier 118 is described in more detail in Section 2.4.1. As described above, during quarantine processing, the user opted to approve the message. The user approval of the message provides an authoritative indication of the status of the message (e.g., message is a non-spam message)., 220790=In step 1290, the appropriate process (pass, fail, or quarantine) is applied as described above., 187588=In step 1182, a determination is made whether messages in the inbox are to be retested based on the updated screening list. This step is optional. If inbox messages are to be retested, operation proceeds to step 1184. If inbox messages are not to be retested, operation proceeds to step 1186., 219079=In step 1260, a determination is made whether any additional friends remain at this level. If friends remain at this level, operation returns to step 1230 where a screening list associated with a next set of one or more friends is identified. If no friends remain at this level, operation proceeds to step 1270., 219444=In step 1270, a determination is made whether additional levels are indicated. If no additional levels are indicated, operation proceeds to step 1280. If additional levels are indicated, operation proceeds to step 1275., 219925=In step 1280, a determination is made whether any conflicting results were identified during filtering. This step is optional. Step 1280 would not be present in an embodiment where pass/fail results causes friends processing to end. In that embodiment, no possibility for conflicting results exists. If no conflicting results were identified, operation proceeds to step 1290. If conflicting results were identified, operation proceeds to step 1285., 172100=In step 1020, a challenge message including authentication information (e.g., signed hash of original message) is composed. The message is signed by user 2 and sent to user 1., 188118=In step 1186, update processing is performed. Operation then proceeds to step 1187., 71689=The data processing unit 1703 may also include an interface 1760 which may receive objects (such as data, applications, software, images, etc.) from external entities 1780 via any communications media including wired and wireless communications media. In such cases, objects 1770 are transported between external entities 1780 and interface 1760 via signals 1765, 1775. In other words, signals 1765, 1775 include or represent control logic for enabling a processor or computer to perform the functions of the invention. According to embodiments of the invention, such signals 1765, 1775 are also considered to be computer program products, and the invention is directed to such computer program products., 217747=In step 1220, the sharing level is set at an initial value. In an embodiment, the initial value is the level representing the user. This allows a user to prefer his screening list over the screening lists in other levels., 187033=In step 1180, Block processing is applied to the approve/block list. At a high level, Block processing removes addresses on the approve/block list from the positive screening list (or as positive entries) and adds the addresses on the approve/block list to the negative screening list (or as negative entries). Exemplary Block processing is described below in section 2.2.1. Block processing is optional. In an embodiment supporting only a single type of action, steps 1180-1186 would not be included., 116080=Another type of sender address is a resender address. A single message may include any number of resender addresses, including zero. Most often the resender of a message will be a Mailing List Manager (MLM) but it can also be a person or device sending mail on behalf of another person. In these cases, the identity of the original sender is usually, but not always, preserved in the From header and the envelope sender is usually, but not always, set to be an address controlled by the resender. This allows replies to go to the original sender but directs administrative messages (e.g., bounce messages) to the resender. Many resenders also add additional headers to the message to identify the resender. IETF RFC 2369 and RFC 2919 describe the standard headers for including resender address information. The RFC standard headers include the following:, 218008=In step 1230, the screening list associated with one or more friends at the level is identified. For example, in the initial pass, the screening list used will be the screening list associated with the user., 192032=In step 1197, a determination is made whether the generated score indicated a high confidence that the message was spam. If the generated score indicates a high confidence that the message was not spam, the score is consistent with the authoritative status indication and fail processing ends. If the generated score indicates a high confidence that the message was spam, the score is inconsistent with the authoritative status indication and considered erroneous. Operation then proceeds to step 1198., 218495=In step 1250, the result of filter processing is determined. In an embodiment, if the result of filtering is pass or fail, friends of friends filter processing is ended and the appropriate processing (pass or fail) is applied to the message. If the result of filtering is quarantine, then operation proceeds to step 1260 where the message is screened against other screening list. In a second embodiment, operation proceeds to step 1260 regardless of the result of filtering. In this embodiment, the result of filtering is stored., 192996=As would be appreciated by persons of skill in the art, step 1197 could determine whether the score indicated a high confidence that the message was not spam., 189288=In step 1188, the received message is marked as a spam message and used to train statistical classifier 118. In this manner, statistical classifier 118 is not trained using every received message. Instead, statistical classifier 118 is only trained when an error or discrepancy is found between the authoritative status indication and the spam score., 69636=Data processing unit 1703 includes a communications medium 1710 (such as a bus, for example) to which other modules are attached., 189699=As would be appreciated by persons of skill in the art, step 1187 could determine whether the score indicated a high confidence that the message was spam., 229509=In step 1470, a determination is made whether the score generated in step 1410 indicates a high confidence that the received message is not spam. If the score indicates a high confidence that message is not spam, the score is inconsistent with the authoritative status indication and considered erroneous. Operation proceeds to step 1478. If the score does not indicate a high confidence that the message is not spam, the score is consistent with the authoritative status indication and pass processing ends. As would be readily appreciated by persons of skill in the art, the determination could be whether the score generated in step 1410 indicates a high confidence that the received message is spam., 188248=In an embodiment, additional steps 1187 and 1188 are performed to train statistical classifier 118. These steps are optional. Training of statistical classifier 118 is described in more detail in Section 2.4.1. As described above, during quarantine processing, the user opted to block the message. The user blocking of the message provides an authoritative indication of the status of the message (e.g., message is a spam message)., 186536=In step 1169, a determination is made whether more addresses remain to be confirmed. If no more addresses remain to be confirmed, operation proceeds to step 1170. If more addresses remain to be confirmed, operation proceeds to 1164., 188740=In step 1187, a determination is made whether the generated score indicated a high confidence that the message was not spam. If the generated score indicates a high confidence that the message was spam, the score is consistent with the authoritative status indication and processing ends. If the generated score indicates a high confidence that the message was not spam, the score is inconsistent with the authoritative status indication and considered erroneous. Operation then proceeds to step 1188., 184664=In step 1160, confirmation processing is performed. Confirmation processing is optional. In an embodiment, a user can configure confirmation processing. For example, a user can determine whether confirmation processing is performed and whether bulk confirmation of multiple addresses or individual confirmation is to be applied., 70832=The computer program products 1750 include a non-transitory computer useable medium 1752 on which objects may be stored, such as but not limited to optical mediums, magnetic mediums, etc., 190645=In step 1194, the quarantined messages are retested following the method described in Section 2.1., 186822=In 1170, the selected action is identified. If Block was selected, operation proceeds to step 1180. If Approve was selected, operation proceeds to step 1190., 228002=In step 1448, the received message is marked as a spam message and used to train statistical classifier 118., 216238=Flowchart 1200 begins a step 1210 when the designated list of friends is determined. There is a variety of ways in which lists can be shared among friends. In an embodiment, each user's list can be communicated to all of their friends, either directly or via a centralized database. However, a limitation of this approach is that each user can view the addresses on their friends' lists. This loss of privacy may be unacceptable to some users. Because each user maintains their own list, this approach avoids the synchronization issues described above in reference to list synchronization., 237616=In step 1660, the oldest messages in the system are removed according to a ratio representative of the ratio of the total number of non-spam messages to the total number of spam messages until the minimum message count is reached. The minimum message count represents the lowest number of total messages the classifier database has in order to operate according to specifications. In an embodiment, the minimum message count is user configurable., 228157=In step 1450, a user action associated with the message is received. Step 1450 is reached when the message is neither on the positive screening list or the negative screening list. That is, the message is in the quarantine folder. If a message approve action is received, operation proceeds to step 1460. If a message block action is received, operation proceeds to step 1470., 233241=In step 1540, the system retrains the statistical classifier using the identified messages in a ratio representative of the ratio determined in step 1520. During this step messages which were incorrectly added to the database during the first bulk training pass are removed from the database. In this manner, unnecessary information is removed from the database., 220434=In step 1285, conflict processing is applied. For example, conflict processing may prefer the most optimistic result (if filtering against any screening list results in pass, then message passes) or may prefer the most pessimistic result (if filtering against any screening list results in fail, then message fails)., 226651=In step 1438, the received message is marked as a non-spam message and used to train statistical classifier 118., 190783=In step 1196, update processing is performed. For example, selected messages are run through the approve operation, resulting in the moving of approved messages to the user's Inbox. Unselected messages are marked as \u201creviewed\u201d and left in the quarantine folder., 182860=In step 1130, one or more individual quarantined messages are selected. In an embodiment, the selection includes highlighting a check box located next to a message. As would be appreciated by persons of skill in the art, other method of selection could be used., 229350=In step 1468, the received message is marked as a non-spam message and used to train statistical classifier 118., 232500=In step 1520, the system determines the ratio of non-spam messages and spam messages. For example, if the user identifies 1000 non-spam messages and 2000 spam messages, the ratio is 1:2., 183949=In step 1145, the system waits for an action from the user., 173791=After the authenticated challenge/response cycle is completed, in step 1060, the systems associated with user 1 and user 2 store the public keys (or entire certificates) associated with each address. The public keys can then be used to detect future man-in-the-middle or similar types of malicious attacks. In an embodiment, the authenticated challenge/response cycle can be used as a public key exchange between two parties. The whole challenge/response cycle does not need to involve storing state about specific messages that each party sends. The signature validation serves that purpose in a stateless way. If an invalid signature (e.g., message has been tampered with) is detected, the process aborts and the message is treated as if it is unsigned., 182507=For additional details on searching methods that can be used with the above filtering process, see provisional patent application U.S. Ser. No. 11/245,100, filed Oct. 7, 2005 entitled \u201cMethod, Apparatus, and Computer Program Product for Searching Digital Data\u201d, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety., 101645=Most MTAs (e.g., mail servers) record the SMTP envelope sender in a Return-Path header in the message so that MUAs will be able to access this information. Because RFC 2822 headers are easier to read than SMTP traces, the examples below show the envelope sender in Return-Path headers., 237353=In step 1650, a determination is made whether any messages older than a predetermined age remain in the system. If older messages remain, operation proceeds to step 1660. If no older messages remain, processing ends., 232156=In step 1510, identification of a set of non-spam messages and a set of spam messages is received. In an embodiment, the user manually selects a set of messages and/or one or more folders as \u201cnon-spam\u201d messages and a set of messages and/or one or more folders as \u201cspam\u201d messages via a provided interface., 172315=In step 1030, user 1 (the original sender) receives the signed challenge and verifies the validity of the signature. If the signature is valid, authentication data is extracted from the message and the validity of the challenge is verified. For example, if the public key is one of the keys owned by user 1 and the authentication data is valid, operation proceeds to step 1040. If public key and/or authentication data is invalid, operation proceeds to step 1095 where processing ends., 219717=In step 1275, the level is incremented and operation returns to step 1230 where a screening list associated with a next set of one or more friends is identified., 177732=In step 1120, the quarantined messages are displayed. For example, the unreviewed messages are displayed in a quarantine user interface. Alternatively, all quarantine messages (both reviewed and unreviewed) are displayed in the quarantined folder., 235626=In step 1620, the total number of messages in the classifier database is determined. In addition, the total number of non-spam messages in the classifier database and the total number of spam messages in the classifier database are determined in this step., 232726=In step 1530, the system trains the statistical classifier using the identified messages in a ratio representative of the ratio determined in step 1520. In the example discussed in step 1520, the system trains using 1 non-spam message followed by 2 spam messages. This pattern is repeated until all identified messages have been processed. In an embodiment, the bulk training is train on error training. Step 1530 represents the first bulk training pass., 172854=In step 1040, user 1 constructs a response message that includes authentication data associated with the challenge (e.g., signed hash of the challenge). User 1 signs the response and sends the response to user 2., 187934=In step 1184, the messages in the inbox are retested following the method described in Section 2.1. Operation then proceeds to step 1187., 185032=In step 1162, a determination is made whether confirmation of each address to be affected by the action is required. In general, a user usually expects approve and block to operate on the original sender (e.g., From address), but may not expect it to operate on the resender or resenders in a message. Therefore, in certain applications, it is advantageous to confirm with the user which addresses are to be affected by the operation. If confirmation is required, operation proceeds to step 1164. If no confirmation is required, operation proceeds to step 1170., 228594=In step 1460, a determination is made whether the score generated in step 1410 indicates a high confidence that the received message is spam. If the score indicates a high confidence that message is spam, the score is inconsistent with the authoritative status indication and considered erroneous. Operation proceeds to step 1468. If the score does not indicate a high confidence that the message is spam, the score is consistent with the authoritative status indication and pass processing ends. As would be readily appreciated by persons of skill in the art, the determination could be whether the score generated in step 1410 indicates a high confidence that the received message is not spam., 178703=In an embodiment, the order and content of the display list 1310 can be configured. A number of configuration options are possible. For example, messages can be displayed according to their status on the screening list. Messages from originators on the negative screening list can be removed completely from the list., 183161=In step 1140, a determination is made whether an action request is received. An action request includes an approve request or a block request. If no action request is received, operation proceeds to step 1145. If an action request is received, operation proceeds to step 1150. In an embodiment, in step 1140, the determination also includes determining whether a cancel or exit action was received. If a cancel or exit action was received, operation proceeds to step 1142., 190307=In step 1192, a determination is made whether the quarantined messages are to be retested based on the updated screening list. If quarantined messages are to be retested, operation proceeds to step 1194. If quarantined messages are not to be retested, operation proceeds to step 1196., 186255=In step 1167, the confirmed addresses are included in the approve/block address list., 71066=Control logic or software may be stored in main memory 1730, second storage device(s) 1740, and/or computer program products 1750., 225260=In step 1420, filtering logic is applied to the received message. Note that the filtering logic and not the score generated in step 1410 determines the status of the received message., 185647=In step 1164, a request is made for confirmation of one or more addresses. In an embodiment, the request is a simple dialog showing one or more addresses that will be affected with OK or CANCEL buttons. The confirmation dialog may allow the user to choose what action should be taken on an address by address basis., 186002=In step 1166, a determination is made whether confirmation is received. If confirmation is received, operation proceeds to step 1167. If confirmation is not received, operation proceeds to step 1168., 183701=In step 1142, cancel/exit processing is performed. Cancel/exist processing ends quarantine processing. In an embodiment, the state of the messages (reviewed/unreviewed) in the quarantined folder is unchanged., 226810=In step 1440, a determination is made whether fail processing is applied to the message. This step is optional. Fail processing is applied when one or more of the addresses associated with the message are found on the negative screening list. If fail processing is applied, operation proceeds to step 1445. If fail processing is not applied, operation proceeds to step 1450., 236492=In step 1640, the oldest messages in the system are removed according to a ratio representative of the ratio of the total number of non-spam messages to the total number of spam messages until the maximum message count is reached. Each message has an associated age. In this step, messages are deleted based on their associated age. For example, assume a user has 6000 messages stored, 4000 non-spam messages and 2000 spam messages. The ratio of non-spam to spam messages is 2:1. In addition, assume that the maximum message threshold is 5000. The system must then remove at least 1000 messages. In this example, the system removes the two oldest non-spam messages, then the oldest spam message and repeats this pattern. Alternatively, the system removes the 667 oldest non-spam messages and the 333 oldest spam messages., 189893=In step 1190, Approve processing is applied to the approve/block list. At a high level, Approve processing adds addresses on the approve/block list to the positive screening list (or as positive entries) and removes the addresses on the approve/block list from the negative screening list (or as negative entries). Exemplary Approve processing is described in Section 2.2.1.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. Thus, the breadth and scope of the present invention should not be limited by any of the above-described exemplary embodiments, but should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents. 3. Conclusion A client typically trusts the last MTA in the chain because it is the user's mail server. Any headers written above the final Received header can therefore by trusted. If the destination MTA also trusts upstream MTAs, it can communicate this information to the client in a header above the final Received header. This information might be a server name, IP, or a count of the number of Received headers the client can trust. In an embodiment, a client leverages the anti-spam and authentication functionality of MTAs by reading mail headers written to the message by the MTA. Every MTA prepends a Received header to the message when it processes the message. By placing headers that the MTA wants to communicate to the client above the Received header that it writes, the client knows it can trust all headers above the Received header of any MTA that the client trusts. 2.6 SMTP Received Tagging If a message",
