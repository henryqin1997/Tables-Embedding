Keywords myname50 _temp j a23b9 retVal mohd zara abc move_name a_123  Objective-C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. Objective-C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in Objective-C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers: An Objective-C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore _ followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9). Identifiers You can not have comments with in comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals. /* my first program in Objective-C */  Comments are like helping text in your Objective-C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below: Comments return 0; NSLog(@\"Hello, World! \\n\");  For example, following are two different statements: In Objective-C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity. Semicolons ; ; ) \"Hello, World! \\n\" ( @ NSLog  The individual tokens are: NSLog(@\"Hello,",

Whitespace is the term used in Objective-C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement:  int age; There must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement,  fruit = apples + oranges; // get the total fruit no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish for readability purpose. Objecive-C Data Types In the Objective-C programming language, data types refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted. The types in Objective-C can be",
