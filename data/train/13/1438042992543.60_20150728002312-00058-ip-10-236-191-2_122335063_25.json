The mare must remain in Indiana continuously until foaling. The resulting foal will then be registered as an Indiana bred. In the event a mare entered the State of Indiana and was registered with the IHRC after December 1 of the year prior to foaling, the foal (which must be foaled in Indiana) will be eligible to be registered as an Indiana bred only if said mare was bred back to a registered Indiana stallion after foaling in Indiana., 29662=The direct revenue received by the State of Indiana exceeded the cost of regulation.
