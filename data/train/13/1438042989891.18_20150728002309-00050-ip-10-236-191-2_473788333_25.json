If the DCD/UCD transmission offset is used, the transmission offset has to be 16 bits considering a 16-bit maximum paging cycle of the power saving mode and a 10-second maximum DCD/UCD transmission cycle (e.g., 2000 frames where 1 frame=5milliseconds). As for using the frame number, even if lower 8 bits are used, a frame to transmit the DCD/UCD can be indicated, thus able to decrease the size of the transmission message.}",

Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. , the apparatus includes a receiver 10 which receives status information, such as the DCD message and/or the UCD message, of a first channel descriptor and transmission frame information which includes when the first channel descriptor is scheduled to be transmitted. The apparatus further includes a comparator 20 which is used to compare status information of the first channel descriptor with status information of a second channel descriptor. Here, the second channel descriptor is stored in a memory 30 of the MS. Furthermore, the receiver 10 also receives the first channel descriptor according to the transmission frame information if the compared status information from the comparator 20 are different. FIG. 7 is an example of an apparatus in a power saving mode which is used to update channel information. In FIG. 7 In another embodiment of the present invention, an operation of updating channel information can be performed by an apparatus in a power saving mode. As shown in Table 18, a flag",
