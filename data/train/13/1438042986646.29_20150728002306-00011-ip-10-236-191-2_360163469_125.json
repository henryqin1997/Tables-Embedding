The example configures the IPv6 ACL named list2 and applies the ACL to outbound traffic on Ethernet interface 0. Specifically, the first ACL entry keeps all packets from the network FEC0:0:0:2::/64 (packets that have the site-local prefix FEC0:0:0:2 as the first 64 bits of their source IPv6 address) from exiting out of Ethernet interface 0. The second entry in the ACL permits all other traffic to exit out of Ethernet interface 0. The second entry is necessary because an implicit deny all condition is at the end of each IPv6 ACL.}",
