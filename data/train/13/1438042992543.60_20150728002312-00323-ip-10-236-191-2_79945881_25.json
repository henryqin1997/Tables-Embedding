Alternatively, you can change the database listener to use a port other than 1521, but you can do this only after installation. See the Oracle Application Server Administrator's Guide for details., 94736=If you have some other application listening on port 1521, you need to reconfigure it to listen on a different port. If that is not possible, shut it down while you install the OracleAS Metadata Repository. After installation, you can reconfigure the OracleAS Metadata Repository to use a port other than 1521. See the Oracle Application Server Administrator's Guide for instructions on how to do this., 83875=If port 1521 on your computer is already in use by an existing application, such as Oracle database listener or some other application, you might have to take some action before running the installer.

Port 7777 is the default port because on UNIX, components that use port numbers lower than 1024 require additional steps to be done as the root user before the components can run. Because the installer does not have root access, it has to use a port greater than 1024., 67234=If you use a port number less than 1024 for a component, the installer will not be able to start up the component at the end of installation. You may need to configure the component first before you can start it up. See the appropriate component documentation for details., 153391=The installer displays a warning if port 1521 is in use by any application, including database listeners of any version. You need to stop the application that is using port 1521, then click OK in the warning dialog., 34884=111111-04 or higher: /usr/bin/nawk patch, 23119=Append an \"m\" to the size to specify the size in megabytes (example: 900m).

The example uses ports 81 and 444. These port numbers do not have to be less than 1024. If you select port numbers less than 1024, you have to start up Oracle HTTP Server and OracleAS Web Cache as the root user., 153641=If it is a database listener that is using port 1521, you might be able to use it for the metadata repository database.

To ensure environment variables are set to the correct values, check their values in the shell where you will be running the installer. To check the value of environment variables, use the env command. This displays all the currently defined environment variables and their values. % env If you use the su command to switch users (for example, switching from the root user to the oracle user), check the environment variables when you are the new user because the environment variables might not be passed to the new user. This can happen even if you run su with the - parameter (su - user). # /* root user */ # su - oracle % env 4.9.2 ORACLE_HOME and ORACLE_SID These environment variables must not be set.",
