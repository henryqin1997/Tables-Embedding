            "Campus officers constantly walk the ground of Waubonsee, they drive the roads that are on campus and make sure traffic is moving smoothly as well. If you ever need any help you can walk into the Dickson Center (right next to Bodie Hall), and ask for help at the Campus Police Service Desk. It's right next to the bookstore at the Sugar Grove Campus.",
            "As far as I know, there are no fraternities or sororities on campus at WCC. Seeing as it's a community college with a diverse population student-wise, Greek life is either non-existant or just very secretive.",
            "There's a wide variety of clubs and activities at WCC, and if I was to start listing them out, my fingers would get really tired. The easiest way to find out what might be a good fit for you would be to pick up a brochure and look through all of the clubs we have. The Student Center usually has information on when clubs meet, fundraisers, posters, etc. to help students stay informed.",
            "This college is great for people with lower incomes or people just looking to get the most for their money. If you work part or full-time, Waubonsee is a great choice for you because you can work it around your schedule to better manage your time.",
            "Most mornings, there are a bunch of people who play videogames and bring tv's, computers, board games, etc. and sit at the bar style table in the back of the Sugar Grove cafe. Also, there's a pond on campus at the Sugar Grove location which is really nice for sitting and watching the ducks/geese. There's tables and umbrellas nearby so that you can be comfortable and relaxed outside.",
            "Plenty! And then some... Waubonsee is one of the cheapest routes but it doesn't mean you're not getting what you pay for. I've heard stories from friends that were starting at NIU, UIC, etc. and they actually switched to Waubonsee to get their General Education classes out of the way here because the professors were much friendlier and willing to help you learn and it was way less expensive.",
            "There are plenty of clubs, organizations and sports teams to join if you're looking for fun. Waubonsee also has events now and then such as student performed concerts/shows, etc. Not only that, but off-campus there's a Metra station not far away from the Aurora Campus that you can take right into Chicago and experience all of the museums, food, and entertainment that downtown has to offer!",
            "Compared to high school food, college food here isn't all that bad. We have a really nice Cafe at the Sugar Grove campus that makes fresh burgers and grilled cheese sandwiches that smell fantastic. They also have healthy options and a wide variety of drinks, such as coffees and lattes, to keep you going after a long night (or day) of studying/homework. The Aurora Campus seems to have a nice Cafe as well.",
            "Dorm life doesn't apply at WCC. There's no on-campus living, as it's a community college. Most students who attend live in the area or surrounding areas.",
            "Professors at WCC have a lot of experience in their fields of teaching as well as a more personal approach to teaching. A lot of the professors I've had in the past semester have been more than willing to work with students during office hours and were really focused on making sure you learned the subject material. It's not all cut and dry at Waubonsee, and I think that's one of the things I like the most about my college.",
            "If you have a particular field you know you want to get into, Waubonsee is the perfect place to test that out. The automotive programs at Waubonsee, for example, are some of the top rated in the country. I suggest picking classes early because classes DO fill up quickly. Another tip would be: Talk to a counselor or advisor. When I was an incoming Freshman, I went and talked to an advisor and she really helped me out with what I needed to do to get started on the right track.",
            "Waubonsee is, fundamentally, the most obvious choice for any incoming freshman in the southwest Illinois suburbs area. With lower costs than any state universities, staff and teachers who are actually there for you when you need anything, and the technology/environment to get you where you need to go, they have it all. I couldn't be happier with my choice to attend here!"

Their dual placement program with 4 year institutions is awesome! You will save alot of money by going this route. Instead of paying $1000-$2000 a class you'll pay about $300.

Bang for the buck I am saving SO MUCH MONEY! It was hard for me to opt for a community college instead of a 4 year school right away, but it was well worth it. Definitely! Am enjoying being here Pretty campus, nice teachers, great schedules & opportunities. Very convenient & student friendly. Am learning a lot The classes are small with a lot of individual attention, I was nervous after taking some time off after high school, that college classes would catch me off guard, but this is a great place to start your learning & get into the college level work load.
