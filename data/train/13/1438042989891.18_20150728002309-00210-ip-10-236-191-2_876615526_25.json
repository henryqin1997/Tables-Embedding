            "There are weekly things today, for example; the first Friday of every month there are free movies at the movie theater, as well as activities on the weekends such as gingerbread house making. Inter-mural sports are also really fun to participate it!",
            "The food is good, especially the mac 'n cheese that is served on Fridays! There are a lot of different choices as of what to eat, especially in the various amounts of ice cream! There are even vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options.",
            "I lived in the typical freshman dorms (Baldwin Hall) my freshman year. The rooms were big and every hall seems to become really close. The college recently got new furniture in the dorm I was in last year so it was updated which was very nice.",
            "The classes were definitely hard and you do get a lot of work, but if you manage your time well, you will achieve all of your academic goals.",
            "Join a few clubs that you are interested in, it is a great way to meet people and get involved on campus. If you get the chance come to one of the prospective student overnight programs. You will get to stay with a student and attend classes that you are interested in and it will help you decide if it is the school for you. Also, don't worry, the host students for this program are all really nice and excited to have you stay with them!",
            "At Allegheny College you are more than just a number, the professors really take the time to help you if you have questions. Though it might be in a small town, the campus has a lot to offer, you will be impressed!"

Tips for prospective students Visit the campus; talk to the professors, but do not be wooed by the admission staff, because when you get into Allegheny you won't see these people very often, and them knowing your name and where your from will not really matter.
