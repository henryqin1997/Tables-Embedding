    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{483753=However the concept of persistent identifiers is still imperative to a working Internet. While effort is put into finding the best approach there is much that those creating Web pages can do to ensure that their URIs are persistent. In 1998 Tim Berners-Lee coined the phrase Cool URIs to describe URIs which do not change. His article explains the methods a Webmaster would use to design a URI that will stand the test of time. As Berners-Lee elucidates \"URIs don't change: people change them.\" [4]., 641845=The Institutional Web Management Workshop 2006, held at the University of Bath on 14-16th June 2006, made extensive use of social bookmarking services:, 498132=Podcasting is a relatively new phenomena becoming popular in late 2004. Some of the early adopters regard Podcasting as a democratising technology, allowing users to easily create and publish their own radio shows which can be easily accessed within the need for a broadcasting infrastructure. From a technical perspective, Podcasting is an application of the RSS 2.0 format [2]. RSS can be used to syndicate Web content, allowing Web resources to be automatically embedded in third party Web sites or processed by dedicated RSS viewers. The same approach is used by Podcasting, allowing audio files (typically in MP3 format) to be automatically processed by third party applications - however rather than embedding the content in Web pages, the audio files are transferred to a computer hard disk or to an MP3 player - such as an iPod., 280030=It is generally good practice to not correcting factual errors or mistakes of grammar or spelling in the original., 295114=You should also ensure that date and time are referenced correctly. These can be easily confused when exporting database fields in a text file. For example, a date that reads '12/04/2003' can be interpreted as April 12th or December 4th, 2003. To avoid ambiguity always enter and store dates with a four-digit century and times of day using the 24 hour clock. The ISO format (yyyy-mm-dd) is useful for absolute clarity, particularly when mixing databases at a later date., 284848=Date and time can be easily confused when exporting database fields in a text file. A date that reads '12/04/2003' can have two meanings, referring to April 12th or December th, 2003. To avoid ambiguity always enter and store dates with a four-digit century and times of day using the 24 hour clock. The ISO format (yyyy-mm-dd) is useful for absolute clarity, particularly when mixing databases at a later date., 150578=In the event that an author, or authors, is unobtainable, the project is required to demonstrate they have taken steps to contact them. Digital preservation projects are particularly difficult in this aspect, separating the researcher and the copyright owner by many years. In many cases, more recently the 1986 Domesday project, it has proven difficult to trace authorship of 1000+ pieces of work to individuals. In this project, the designers created a method of establishing permission and registering objections by providing contact details that an author could use to identify their work., 548563=This document is a modified version of a document on \"The e-Framework for Education and Research\" published on the E-Framework Web site at <http://www.e-framework.org/about/> (version last modified on 2005-10-16 11:05 PM)., 285387=Currency data types are designed for modern decimal currencies and can cause problems when handling old style currency systems, such as Britain's currency system prior to 1971 that divided currency into pounds, shillings and pence., 482878=Example: 10.1000/123456 This is made up of the prefix (10.1000) which is the string assigned to an organisation that registering DOIs and the suffix (123456) which is a unique (to a given prefix) alphanumeric string, which could be an existing identifier., 424961=Policies should be written to conform to the requirements of relevant legislation, notably the Data Protection Act, 1998., 486158=With the rise of the Internet and increased use of digital networks it has become easier to both work in an informal and adhoc manner, and as part of a community. In the late 1990s Weblogs (or blogs), a Web application similar to an online diary, became popular and user centred metadata was first created. In late 2003 delicious, an online bookmark manager, went live. The ability to add tags using a non-hierarchical keyword categorisation system was appended in early 2004.Tagging was quickly replicated by other social software and in late 2004 the Folksonomy name, a portmanteau of folk and taxonomy, was coined by Thomas Vander Wal., 280183=Double-entry is the best solution - where two people separately transcribe the same document and the results are then compared. Two people are unlikely to make the same errors, so this technique should reveal most errors. It is, however often impractical because of the time and expense involved. Running a grammar and spell checker over the transcribed document is a simpler way of finding many errors (but assumes the original document was spelt and written according to modern usage)., 598915=An example which illustrates the commercial takeup of the hCalendar microformat is its use with the World Cup 2006 fixture list [4]. This application allows users to choose their preferred football team. The fixtures are marked up using hCalendar and can be easily added to the user's calendaring application., 262663=When metadata harvesting is carried out within the JISC Information Environment the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI PMH) [1] version 2.0 is recommended. The Open Archives Initiative [2] had it roots in the e-prints community who were trying to improve access to scholarly resources. The OAI PMH was developed initially by an international technical committee in 1999. It is a light-weight low cost protocol that is built on HTTP and XML. The protocol defines six requests, known as verbs:, 671321=Various solutions exist for this problem. One is the possibility of testing early prototype layouts containing 'greeked' text - that is, the 'lorem imsum' placeholder text commonly used for layout design [1]. A method for testing the recognisability of page elements was discussed in Neilsen's Alertbox back in 1998 [2], though the concept originated with Thomas S. Tullis [3]., 646213=Unlike Blogs, Wikis are normally used in a collaborative way. They may therefore be suitable for use by small groups at a conference [6]. An example of this can be seen at the WWW 2006 conference [7]., 645799=Delegates can make use of Blogs to take notes: This is being increasingly used at conferences, especially those with a technical focus, such as IWMW 2006 [4]. Note that Blogs are normally used by individuals. In order to allow several Blogs related to the same event to be brought together it is advisable to make use of an agreed tag [5]., 388412=Keywords: A simple but crude method is to anticipate the terms that an unguided searcher might intuitively choose and insert them into a keyword field within relevant records. For instance, the text of Ten days that shook the world [1], a classic narrative of the events of 1917, is more likely to be retrieved if the keywords Russian Revolution are added by the cataloguer (based on his/her analysis of the resource and subject knowledge) and if the keyword field is included in the search. In the absence of an agreed vocabulary, however, variant spellings (labor versus labour), and synonyms or near synonyms (Marxist versus Communist) that distort retrieval are likely to proliferate., 492325=Creative Commons (CC) [1] refers to a movement started in 2001 by US lawyer Lawrence Lessig that aims to expand the collection of creative work available for others to build upon and share. The Creative Commons model makes a distinction between the big C (Copyright) meaning All Rights Reserved and CC meaning Some Rights Reserved. It does so by offering copyright holders licences to assign to their work, which will clarify the conditions of use and avoid many of the problems current copyright laws pose when attempting to share information., 66326=Standards are \"documented agreements containing technical specifications or other precise criteria to be used consistently as rules, guidelines, or definitions of characteristics, to ensure that materials, products, processes and services are fit for their purpose\" (ISO 1997). The aim of international standards is to encapsulate most appropriate current practice. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) [1] is the head of all national standardisation bodies. The most relevant ISO standard for software code development is ISO 9000-3: 1997 (QA for the development, supply, installation and maintenance of computer software). For other relevant standards also check the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers [2] and the American National Standards Institute [3]., 37797=Surveys of search facilities used on UK University Web sites have been carried out since 1998 [6]. This provides information not only on the search engines tools used, but also to spot trends., 106046=The merging of two different data sources is likely to present specific problems. When combining two GIS tables, the designer should consider the possibility that they have been constructed using different projection measurement systems (a method of representing the Earth's three-dimensional form on a two-dimensional plane and locate landmarks by a set of co-ordinates). The projection co-ordinate systems vary across nations and through time: the US has five primary co-ordinate systems in use that significantly differ with each other. The British National Grid removes this confusion by using a single co-ordinate, but can cause problems when merging contemporary with pre-1940 maps that were based upon Cassini projection. This may produce incompatibilities and unexpected results when plotted, such as moving boundaries and landmarks to different locations that will need to be rectified before any real benefits can be gained. The designer should understand the project system used for each layer to compensate for inaccuracies., 207842=The specification is relatively new. Version 1.2 was made public in 2002, and a minor upgrade to Version 1.2.1 was made early in 2003, that corrected some errors and ambiguities. The specification is complex comprising nine separate documents. Various commercial assessment systems (e.g. Questionmark [2], MedWeb, Canvas Learning [3]) have implemented some aspect of IMS QTI compatibility for their assessments. A number of academic systems are also being developed to comply with the specification. These include the TOIA project [4] which will have editing and course management facilities, the SToMP system [5], which was used with students for the first time in 2002, and a Scottish Enterprise system called Oghma which is currently being developed., 151728=<book id=\"bk112\"> <author>Galos, Mike</author> <title>Visual Studio 7: A Comprehensive Guide</title> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<publish_date>2001-04-16</publish_date> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<publisher>Addison Press</publisher> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<copyright>Galos, M. 2001</copyright> </book>, 589006=A risk management approach [3] was taken to use of various Web 2.0 services on the Institutional Web Management Workshop 2006 Web site.}",
