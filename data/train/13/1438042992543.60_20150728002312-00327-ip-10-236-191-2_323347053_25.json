    "textBeforeTable": "Advanced Catching Metrics No BP Roundtables have mentioned this guy. BP Roundtables Love Highland Park, jlarsen. Great place to live. You don't win with 25 guys, and an older club needs even more depth. Brian Cashman is absolutely brilliant, constantly finds options, so I like that deal. If you're rigid in your thinking this time of the year, you will regret it next season when you don't have options. (Dan Evans) Yankees acquired Eli Whiteside, then sign him to a deal within last week or so to avoid arbitration. However, they end up just DFA'ing him yesterday to make room for Pettitte. Why all the trouble in acquiring & signing him to a deal, when you were just going to attempt to put him through waivers in long-run in hopes to have him ready in SWB \"in case of emergency\"? (jlarsen from Highland Park, IL) 2012-11-29 13:00:00\u00a0(link to chat) Best question yet. Springfield Isotopes, Shelbyville Nuclear Power Plant team. (Ben Lindbergh) Opening Day 2013, Sandy Rosario will be a member of ____? Eli Whiteside will be a member of ____? (jlarsen from chicago)",
