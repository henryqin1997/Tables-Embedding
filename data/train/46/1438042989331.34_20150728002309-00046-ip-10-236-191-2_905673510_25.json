            "The food is okay, nothing too great. But what cafeteria food is? The tuck shops has more variety, with a subway, a grill, a taco/burrito grill, Pizza Hut, and a mini panera, so if you get sick of the cafe food you can go to one of those places.",
            "I'm currently living in one of the five freshmen dorm buildings this year. The rooms are just a typical size, and between two rooms is a bathroom. The overall experience of the dorm life it great. The floors are co-ed which is nice because there are different people to interact with rather just having same-sex floors.",
            "So far this year, my classes have been challenging. But I don't mind the challenge that much. The campus has several different academic resources that students can resort to when they need extra help with a class, so if you're having trouble there's always someone there to help you succeed.",
            "Make sure that wherever you decide to go that you just make the best of your experience. It can be hard your first year being away from home and making new friends, but if you get involved with your campus you'll find college to be a great experience in no time. But just remember, academics comes first.",
            "In my first weeks of studying at Pitt-Johnstown, I felt comfortable with my schedule and making my way around campus. The campus is smaller than Pitt-Main, but I love how you can recognize faces and everyone gets to know each other quickly. Overall, the professors are friendly and get to know you by name, making this a great place to start out at if you're looking to start at a branch campus."

If the emergency button is pressed they are quickly on scene. They deserve much respect. (p.s. our campus is very quiet. not many issues.) Greek Life There is Greek Life on campus, however I do not know how many of each Fraternity/Sorority there are. Clubs and Activities Previously explained, but once again GET INVOLVED WITH CLUBS!!! The are worth your time, and I promise you will not regret your choices. Great for these types of students Become involved with clubs. Share any unusual traditions or locations on campus To the lack of many students knowledge, there is a old cemetery",
