    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6574=Referring to FIG. 23, an indirect CoS scheme contains a CoS Definition Entry 2310, which contains a CoS specifier X and a list of attributes. This CoS specifier X is an attribute such as manager that points to another entry, which could be any entry or another target entry. This list of attributes could include, for example, a fax number attribute that is shared by all the persons in a particular group managed by that manager. Three target entries A, B and C are shown in FIG. 23. Of these entries, C could be a manager of the group. Entry A uses indirect CoS to take on the values for certain attributes, such as fax number, from A's manager, i.e., target entry C. Note that in order for this to be possible, the value given to the CoS specifier X in A's entry must be a valid DN, in this case, the DN of the manager entry C. FIG. 24 shows an example of an indirect CoS. In this example, each person's entry will inherit \u201caccounting code\u201d from their manager's entry. When an employee moves to another department, and thereby his manager changes, accounting codes automatically change to the correct new value when an employee's manager attribute changes.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{171550=In an embodiment, the Directory Server uses a format such as the LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF), which is a standard text-based format for describing directory entries. LDIF is defined in RFC 2849 and is available through sources such as the IETF. An LDIF-compliant directory has one or more directory entries separated by a blank line. An entry is a group of lines in the LDIF file that contains information about an object, such as a person in an organization or a printer on a network. Information about the entry is represented in the LDIF file by a set of attributes and their values. Each entry has an optional entry identifier (ID), a required distinguished name, one or more object classes, and one or more attribute definitions. The object class is attribute that specifies the kind of object the entry describes and defines the set of additional attributes it contains. Each attribute describes a particular trait of an entry., 47595=As an example, consider a web accounting application that needs to restrict the creation of purchase orders to purchasing department staff, unless the order value is less than $1000 in which case managers can place orders. With a traditional Directory Service the application can choose to store an attribute for each person entry which dictates the maximum value purchase order that person may create. This scheme has the disadvantage that the logic behind the assignment of order value to each person may be lost., 44552=Entries are typically organized in a specified tree structure, and each entry is composed of attributes. In an LDAP-compliant directory server, each user and group in an organization or an enterprise is represented by a Distinguished Name (DN) attribute. As defined in Request for Comment (RFC) 1779, DN attribute is a text string that contains unambiguous identifying information for an associated user, group, or object. DNs are used when a change is made to a user or group directory entry. Directory server entries are typed by an objectclass attribute, which allows searching for those entries with a particular value to the objectclass attribute. To search a company's sales department of a United States corporation, for example, an Directory server query in the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) format:}",
