The disadvantage of setting it to zero is that it is sometimes hard to tell where the cursor is when situated at the boundary of a highlighted region.

For example, if the buffer contained the text: ^A6C3:foobar then after the ^A-A command was applied, the leading \"^A3C3:\" would be gone, and the word \"foobar\" would appear in the foreground and background colors specified by color.fcolor3 and color.bcolor3. The fcolorN resources have default values corresponding to the ANSI convention, while bcolorN default to the window background. If you wish to set bcolorN for special effect, you should add this to your .vilerc file set bcolor=fcolor to tell xvile to use the bcolorN resources when displaying attributed text.

    "textBeforeTable": "X Resources The \"new-process-group\" command has no effect in non-X11 versions of vile. Additionally, if given a count as argument, this command will cause xvile to fork(), and the parent to exit before the new process group is set by the child. This will further isolate it from its process environment (and in fact will move xvile into the background if started from the shell). Some systems and/or some shells and display managers seem to want xvile to run in its own process group, to help isolate its signals and actions from the signals and actions of the parent process (i.e. the shell or window manager that starts xvile). xvile can be forced into its own process group with the \"new-process-group\" command, which one would put in the .vilerc file. Using this will cause a call to \"setpgrp()\" or \"setsid()\". This behavior is not the default because a) it can't be undone, and b) it seems undesirable on some systems, in that xvile cannot be suspended and put in the background after startup if it's in its own group.
