We estimate equation (3) using a two-year rolling window, and plot the point estimates of over time. Charts in Figure 3 plot the significant estimates from such rolling regressions. Two patterns stand out. First, most EM currencies have become more sensitive to news in recent years than before. For instance, in Korea, few U.S. news had significant impact on the won before late 2002, while 4 out of 9 news are persistently significant in recent years. Thailand is an exception, where Thai baht barely reacts to any U.S. news throughout the whole sample.}",

We find that major U.S. macroeconomic news have a strong impact on the returns and volatilities of emerging market exchange rates, but many domestic news do not. Emerging market currencies have become more sensitive to U.S. news in recent years. We also find that market sentiment could sway the impact of news on these currencies systematically, as good (bad) news seems to matter more when optimism (pessimism) prevails. Market uncertainty also interacts with macroeconomic news in a statistically significant way, but its role varies across currencies and news., 169042=We estimate equation (3) using a two-year moving window. In the following charts, bars indicate the significant point estimates from the rolling regressions. Insignificant estimates are left blank. The lines show the number of observations in each regression. As the whole sample covers 2000 - 2007, and the window is for two years, these statistics end at 2005., 11263=In addition, it should be taken into account that the exchange rate regimes in some emerging markets (such as Hungary, Poland, and Turkey), might have changed within the sample period (Appendix 2). The Hungarian foreign exchange regime changed from a crawling peg to a pegged exchange rate within horizontal band in October 2001, and devalued on June 2003. For the Polish zloty, a crawling peg based on 55% of Euro and 45% of dollar changed into independent floating on April 2000. For the Turkish lira, many changes happened during the sample period due to the financial crisis in 2001. The regime changed from a crawling peg to independent floating on February 2001, and the New Turkish lira was introduced on 2005 and became a sole legal tender from January 1, 2006 with a conversion rate of YTL 1 = TL 1 million. We convert all previous TL quotes into YTL based on the conversion rate when calculating log returns of its exchange rate, 172811=Appendix 2. Exchange Regime Changes from 2000 to 2006, 4086=This paper is the first to focus on how U.S. and domestic macroeconomic announcements affect exchange rates in nine emerging markets: Czech Republic, Hungary, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, Thailand, and Turkey. 1 We construct a unique database that covers high frequency exchange rates for the nine emerging market economies from January 2, 2000 to December 31, 2006. The database is complemented by information from Consensus Forecasts on market expectations for these exchange rates, and data from Bloomberg on market expectations for macroeconomic news and the actual announcement. Although similar databases have been studied for major currencies, this is the first time such data for emerging markets are utilized for economic research., 317885=5.\u00a0\u00a0Monthly forecasts for Asian economies are available for the full sample.

Then we calculate 5-minute currency returns by taking log differences. We multiply the log differences of currency returns by 100 to obtain log currency returns. Following ABDV (2003), we exclude data on weekends and national holidays, since the quoted prices may have some bias based on low transaction volumes. First, we drop the period from Friday 21:05 to Sunday 21:00 (local time) for weekends. Second, we drop national holidays in the U.S. and the nine emerging markets., 12288=We use economic forecast data from Bloomberg on various actual and predicted economic indices in the U.S. and nine emerging market countries.4 Many economists and analysts in the financial markets who use Bloomberg submit their own forecasts to Bloomberg. However since such forecast data submission is voluntary, the number of the observations varies for each observation of economic index. For instance, 39 people submitted forecasts of the initial jobless claims in the U.S. that is published by the Department of Labor on January 5, 2008. Based on those forecasts, Bloomberg provides mean, median, maximum, and minimum values for each economic index. In some cases (mostly in emerging markets) the forecasts are based on the views from a small number of economists. We drop all forecasts that are based on views from fewer than 5 economists., 313=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System International Finance Discussion Papers Number 973, May 2009 --- Screen Reader Version*, 52949=Laakkonen, H., 2004, \"The impact of macroeconomic news on exchange rate volatility.\" Bank of Finland Discussion Paper 24., 49460=Barberis, N. and R.
