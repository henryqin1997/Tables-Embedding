    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{192356=In order to determine if other porcine ES-like cells will also require higher doses of G418, this experiment was repeated with mouse ES-D3, D195 and 2 other porcine lines designated M2\u2013176, M2\u2013158. The latter two lines show ES morphology. These were treated with 250, 750 and 1250 \u03bcg/ml G418 for 8 days, then cell counts were determined as in experiment 1. As in the previous experiment, the percent of live cells was different between the mouse ES-D3 and D195 lines at the 250 \u03bcg dose (P<0.01) and was similar at both higher doses. However, D195 cells were more resistant to G418 than any other porcine lines (P<0.05) at 250 \u03bcg/ml. These results are interpreted to mean that mouse ES-cells are more sensitive to G418 than D195 cells. However, these cells also respond differently than other porcine lines indicating that the G418 selection dose must be optimized for each cell line., 148798=Duroc morula, blastocyst and expanded blastocyst stage embryos were injected with Meishan ES cells (Table 1). In 210 of 233 embryos, the blastocoel re-expanded following microinjection of ES cells. Embryos which re-expanded were considered to have survived micromanipulation, therefore resulting in a 90% embryo survival rate. These embryos were surgically transferred to recipient gilts and 48 live piglets were born. This represents an overall fetal survival rate of 22.8% (Table 1). The overall pregnancy rate for recipients receiving micromanipulated embryos was 64% (7/11 recipients were pregnant). The group pregnancy rates for recipients receiving embryos containing ES cells from lines M175F, M688, or M1192 were 80%, 66% and 33%, respectively. (Meishan) ES cell colonies were plucked with a fine pipette to dislodge them from the underlying cells. Colonies were disaggregated into a single cell suspension in trypsin/EDTA solution by gentle pipetting. Morula, blastocyst and expanded blastocyst stage embryos had approximately 5 to 10 ES cells (line M1192) micromanipulated into the cell mass (morula) or into the blastocoel cavity (blastocyst and expanded blastocyst) by means of a glass injection needle. After injection, embryos were immediately transferred to recipient gilts which exhibited the onset of estrus 24 hours after the embryo donor., 99376=The cells that were cultured in only CSCM (or with feeder cells through step 2) are passed every 2\u20134 days in only CSCM, until ES-cell lines with consistent morphology, i.e. size 8\u2013151, with a nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio of \u02dc85:15, and colony growth characteristics (doubling time 18\u201336h) are established. This entire process (Steps 1\u20136) may take from 5\u201321 weeks to isolate a single ES-cell line. These lines are then used for production of chimeras and/or nuclear transfer. It is then determined whether the proper cells have been isolated at this point of the procedure. (see step 7, following), 105542=Periodically it is necessary to pluck colonies as outlined above and re-isolate the ES-cells with consistent morphology, size 8\u201315\u03bc, with a nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio of \u02dc85:15, and growth characteristics (doubling time of 18\u201336 h)., 125759=The overall efficiency of producing ES cell lines from porcine blastocysts is low. A total of 1524 blastocysts were collected and cultured. The number of these embryos that survived to passage 1 was 490 (32.1%). The number of embryos surviving to passages 4\u20136 was 104 (21.2% of embryos passed, 6.8% overall). Twenty-one percent (22/104, 1.5% overall) of the presumptive ES cell lines that reached passage 4, retained the morphological and growth characteristics indicative of pig ES cells. Three of these lines were tested to produce chimeric pigs. There are significant breed as well as individual donor differences in producing ES cell-like colonies., 191229=In order to determine the optimal dose of G418 for selection of porcine neo expressing cells, a dose curve was performed. Both mouse ES-D3 cells and porcine D195 cells were plated into 12 well plates with 1\ufffd104 cells per well in 2 ml of conditioned stem cell media. The day following plating, G418 containing media was added at the following concentrations: 0, 250, 500, 750, 1000 or 1250 \u03bcg/ml. Cells were dispersed and counted on days 2, 4, 6 and 8. The number of live cells in each treatment well as determined by trypan blue exclusion, was divided by the number of cells in the untreated control well for each cell type each day. After 48 h, 68, 6, 2, 2 and 0% of the mouse cells were alive at the respective doses while 70, 54, 75, 29 and 5% of the porcine cells survived. By day 8, only 0.2 \ufffd0.3% of ES-D3 cells were alive in the 250 \u03bcg dose and 0% in all higher doses. At this time 92.7\ufffd4.7% of D195 cells were alive in the 250 \u03bcg treatment group. However, at the 750 \u03bcg dose only 0.03%\ufffd0.03% were alive. Therefore, it was determined that the best dose to select D195 cells is 750 \u03bcg/ml., 214065=The Berkshire and Yorkshire breeds in the United States originated with importations from England in 1823 and 1893, respectively. Chinese pigs, introduced into 19th century America, also played a role in the formation of the Poland China and Chester White breeds. Importation of promising foreign breeds has a long tradition in livestock production, with Landrace (first imported from Denmark in 1934) the most recently introduced pig breed that has contributed substantially to U.S. pork production., 106278=To obtain enriched populations of ES-cells (size 8\u201315\u03bc with a nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio of \u221285:15, and doubling time of 18\u201336 h) for chimera production or nuclear transfer, ES-cell colonies are dislodged from the underlying cells and washed through two changes of calcium/magnesium-free PBS. The colonies are then transferred to 50 \u03bcl drops of trypsin solution and incubated for 1\u20135 min at 37\u201339\ufffd C. The colonies are placed in 1 ml of conditioned stem cell medium (CSCM) to neutralize the trypsin. The cells are disaggregated by vigorous pipetting with a fine bore Pasteur pipette., 21283=The genetic manipulation of ES-cells in culture and the subsequent generation of transgenic animals via intermediate chimeric animals derived from the genetically manipulated ES-cells provide a particularly important advantage of ES-cell technology. Gene knockouts and gene replacements are methods of genetic manipulation via homologous recombination that have been carried out in microorganisms, but have only been practiced in mammalian cells within the past decade. These techniques allow for the targeted inactivation (knockout) of a particular gene, as well as for the replacement of a particular gene with an altered version of the gene, or with another gene. Such knockouts and replacements allow for alterations in the properties of cells and animals that cannot be readily achieved in any other way. The practice of mammalian gene knockouts and gene replacements, including the design of nucleic acid molecules and the detection of successfully altered mammalian cells is discussed in numerous publications, including Thomas et al., 1987; Jasin and Berg, 1988; Mansour et al., 1988; Brinster et al., 1989; Capecchi, 1989; Frohman and Martin, 1989; Hasty et al., 1991; Jeannotte et al., 1991; Mortensen et al., 1992; and Thomas et al., 1992. Therefore, both genetically novel and useful chimeric and transgenic animals may be produced., 212814=9. Breeds of Swine: The Meishan breed is from the lake Taihu region near Shanghai. Taihu pigs appear to be the most prolific in China. The region is characterized as temperate, with temperature averaging 15.7\ufffd C. and ranging from an annual low of \u22129.0\ufffd C. to an annual high of 38.2\ufffd C. The Chinese Taihu breeds of pig are highly prolific and attain puberty at an early age, but have poor growth rates and carcass quality. Chinese Meishan pigs range from light grey to dark black in color with varying degrees of white spots. Meishan pigs characteristically have white feet and hooves, extremely wrinkled faces and large, pendulous ears. Domestication of the pig in China dates back to a least 3,000 B.C. and, over time, Chinese pigs have contributed to the development of world pig breeds. A large number of pigs from South China were imported into the Roman Empire in the 3rd century B.C. and used to improve European breeds. From the 16th through the 18th century A.D., pigs from South China were imported to England and used in the development of modern breeds, particularly the Yorkshire and Berkshire. By the end of the 18th century, breeds with Chinese ancestry had replaced almost all indigenous English breeds., 201892=After 7\u20139 days in culture, the whole embryonic cell colony was partially disaggregated with buffered trypsin/EDTA solution (0.25% trypsin, 0.4% EDTA in Ca++-free, and Mg++-free phosphate buffered saline; 1.0% NaCl, 0.025% KCl, 0.025% KH2PO4 and 0.114% Na2HPO4, pH7.2) for 1 min at 37\u201339\ufffd C. The trypsin/EDTA solution was diluted 1:1 with CSCM, triturated, and the partially disaggregated cells were re-seeded onto new mitomycin C-inactivated STO feeder layers or primary embryonic fibroblasts. For all subsequent passages the cells were plated onto fresh feeder layers with BRL conditioned stem cell media (CSCM). Cells were subcultured as necessary onto increasingly larger culture dishes., 126444=Similarities of individual ungulate (embodied as swine) ES-cells to mouse embryonic stem cells include that the nucleus to cytoplasmic ratio is approximately 85:15. The nucleus is round and contains several prominent nucleoli. Cell size varies somewhat among isolated lines, but most of the stable lines consist of round cells with diameters in the range of 8\u201315 microns., 17653=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Ser. No. 08/063,095 filed May 14, 1993, herein incorporated by reference and issued Jun. 4, 1996 as U.S. Pat. No. 5,523,226., 203653=2. Subculture of STO Cells: When plates of STO cells become or approach confluence (80%), they are subcultured. Medium is removed from the plates, and 2 ml of freshly thawed (thaw in 37\ufffd C. H2O bath) trypsin EDTA (0.25%; 0.04%) added. Plates are placed in a 38\ufffd C. incubator for 5 minutes. Trypsin is neutralized by adding 2 ml of serum-DMEM (sDMEM, complete medium; warmed in the 37\ufffd C. H2O bath) to each plate. Cells are then vigorously pipetted to form a single cell suspension. Fresh medium is added to effect a 1:2\u20131:10 dilution. The dilution ratio is adjusted to the degree of confluence and number of the plates of cells. Plates are gently swirled to ensure uniform plating. Plates are then placed in a 38\ufffd C., 5% CO2 incubator. Medium is changed every 2 days with cells growing to confluence (80%) within 2\u20135 days, depending upon seeding density., 104403=This step in the isolation procedure involves injection of the ES-cells underneath the tunica albuginea of the testis of immune system compromised rodents (e.g. SCID, irradiated nude mouse or rat) to produce teratocarcinomas. The mice are examined for the presence of tumors daily. When palpable tumors are observed the rodent is euthanized and the tumor harvested. Undifferentiated ES-cells are recovered from the tumor and re-introduced into in vitro culture to check whether their morphology and growth characteristics match those expected of ES-cells. ES-cell lines with appropriate morphology, size 8\u201315\u03bc, with a nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio of \u02dc85:15, and growth characteristics (doubling time of 18\u201336 h) are re-established in culture and selected as in Step 6. These lines are used for production of chimeras and/or nuclear transfer. Alternatively, cells from cultures that test positive in the teratocarcinoma assay of step 7, are used., 199761=For embryo collection hatched blastocysts were flushed from the uterus of the donors 6\u20138 days after the first day of estrus (d=0) with Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (D-PBS) which contained 5% fetal calf serum (FCS, Sigma #F-2442, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) or Beltsville Embryo Culture Medium [BECM] which contained 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma # A-9419, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.). BCEM is a modification of TLHGL swine embryo culture medium (Hagen et al., 1991) supplied by Vernon G. Pursel (USDA-ARS), Beltsville, Md., personal communication. The modified BECM formula includes; NaCl (90 mM), KCl (4.83 mM), NaHCO3 (2.14 mM), Hepes (10.91 mM, free-acid), MgCl2.6H2O (0.54 mM), L-glutamine (1.0 mM), calcium lactate (2.14 mM), glucose (0.55 mM), mannitol (11.0 mM), sodium lactate (19.3 mM), sodium pyruvate (0.27 mM), taurine (7.0 mM), EDTA (0.08 mM), phenol red (0.01 g/l) and gentamycin sulfate (0.05 g/l). In the modified formula there was a NaH2PO4.H2O and CaCl2. Hatched blastocysts are cultured in 96-well microtiter plates Nunclon\u2122, NUNC Corp.).}",
