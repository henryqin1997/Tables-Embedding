            "Off Gas Treatment Using a Metal Reactant Alloy Composition - This invention relates to a method and apparatus for treating a flue gas stream containing oxygen containing greenhouse gases. In particular, the method comprises reacting a flue gas steam with a molten aluminum or aluminum alloy bath, creating alumina and elemental carbon, elemental sulfur, and molecular nitrogen. The apparatus includes a reaction vessel for carrying out the reaction, as well as other equipment necessary for capturing and removing the reaction products. Further, the process can be used to cogenerate electricity using the excess heat generated by the process.",
            "Dynamically Generated Dental Articulator Controls - This invention relates to improved methods and apparatus for recording and simulating the condylar movement of an individual. This invention also provides a dental articulator which is designed to simulate the jaw or condylar movements of a patient. This instrument enables a dentist to obtain the necessary diagnostic information for treatment of the occlusal irregularities, such as malocclusion, and the fabrication of dental cast or \u201cdentures\u201d.",
            "Decorative Light Display - A three-dimensional frame for use with decorative light displays and, more particularly, a frame on which lights can be stung that has frame members formed with snap-fit connector ends, which are connected together by intersection pieces that include a plurality of snap-fit connector receptacles for receiving the connector ends, for forming a frame that can easily be repaired, assembled and disassembled.",
            "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DENTAL ARTICULATION - This invention relates to improved methods and apparatus for recording and simulating the condylar movement of an individual. This invention also provides a digital dental articulator method which is designed to simulate the jaw or condylar movements of a patient. This instrument enables a dentist to obtain the necessary diagnostic information for treatment of the occlusal irregularities, such as malocclusion, and the fabrication of dental restorations or \u201cdentures\u201d and for the development of an orthodontic treatment plan."

Rosemeier, Monkton, MD US Patent application number Description Published 20120081545 Unattended Spatial Sensing - An unattended ground sensor system includes a sensor to produce pixel data from a radiating target within its field of view. The detection of such a target is implemented detectors in the sensor other than those used for imaging. Once a target has been detected, the sensor collects a linear array of pixels data at each sampling period throughout the time interval during which the target is within the field of view of the sensor. The linear arrays of pixels are transmitted to a location remote from the sensor, where they are analyzed to classify and identify the target and an alert is issued to applicable personnel when the classification and identification of the target warrants such. 04-05-2012 Ronald G.
