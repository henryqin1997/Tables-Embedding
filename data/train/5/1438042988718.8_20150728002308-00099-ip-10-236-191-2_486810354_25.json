The SELEX\u2122 process is a method for the in vitro evolution of nucleic acid molecules with highly specific binding to target molecules and is described in, e.g., U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/536,428, filed Jun. 11, 1990, now abandoned, U.S. Pat. No. 5,475,096 entitled \u201cNucleic Acid Ligands\u201d, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,270,163 (see also WO 91/19813) entitled \u201cNucleic Acid Ligands\u201d. Each SELEX\u2122-identified nucleic acid ligand, i.e., each aptamer, is a specific ligand of a given target compound or molecule. The SELEX\u2122 process is based on the unique insight that nucleic acids have sufficient capacity for forming a variety of two- and three-dimensional structures and sufficient chemical versatility available within their monomers to act as ligands (i.e., form specific binding pairs) with virtually any chemical compound, whether monomeric or polymeric. Molecules of any size or composition can serve as targets.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{431094=Additionally, through three phases of optimization of ARC1113 (ARC591 with 3 base modifications as described above), it was further discovered that a significant fraction of nucleotides in the conserved hairpin loop and A-rich bulge can be replaced with 2\u2032-O-methyl, 2\u2032-deoxy-, or 2\u2032-deoxy phosphorothioate modifications. In Phase 1 optimization of ARC1113, block 2\u2032-O-methyl modifications that were found to be well tolerated from the optimization of ARC591 were combined with additional single 2\u2032-O-methyl modifications to ARC1113, to yield ARC1508-ARC1517. In Phase 2, the additional 2\u2032-O-methyl modifications that were well tolerated from Phase 1 were combined with 2\u2032-deoxy modifications, to yield ARC1574-ARC1586., 33050=Prostate cancer is a major medical problem of unmet need. It is the most common form of cancer in men with a lifetime incidence (cumulative from birth to death) of 1 in 6. Overall, prostate cancer is the second highest cause of cancer deaths in men (\u02dc30,000 per year). Within the U.S., 220,900 patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2003. Most of these patients are diagnosed early and the cure rate is very high with surgery and/or radiation treatment. However, 10-50% of patients with localized disease will progress to advanced metastatic disease (Stage III)., 98077=2\u2032 modified aptamers of the invention are created using modified polymerases, e.g., a modified T7 polymerase, having a rate of incorporation of modified nucleotides having bulky substituents at the furanose 2\u2032 position that is higher than that of wild-type polymerases. For example, a mutant T7 polymerase (Y639F) in which the tyrosine residue at position 639 has been changed to phenylalanine readily utilizes 2\u2032deoxy, 2\u2032amino-, and 2\u2032fluoro-nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) as substrates and has been widely used to synthesize modified RNAs for a variety of applications. However, this mutant T7 polymerase reportedly can not readily utilize (i.e., incorporate) NTPs with bulky 2\u2032-substituents such as 2\u2032-OMe or 2\u2032-azido (2\u2032-N3) substituents. For incorporation of bulky 2\u2032 substituents, a double T7 polymerase mutant (Y639F/H784A) having the histidine at position 784 changed to an alanine residue in addition to the Y639F mutation has been described and has been used in limited circumstances to incorporate modified pyrimidine NTPs. See Padilla, R. and Sousa, R., Nucleic Acids Res., 2002, 30(24): 138. A mutant T7 polymerase (H784A) having the histidine at position 784 changed to an alanine residue has also been described. Padilla et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 2002, 30: 138. In both the Y639F/H784A double mutant and H784A mutant T7 polymerases, the change to a smaller amino acid residue such as alanine allows for the incorporation of bulkier nucleotide substrates, e.g., 2\u2032-OMe substituted nucleotides., 418578=Through these experiments, three base changes relative to the original sequence were identified that marginally improved the apparent affinity of the aptamer for PSMA. Replacement of position A12 in the A-rich bulge with C (observed in 13% of reselected clones) improved the NAALADase IC50 by approximately 20%. Similar improvement was observed when the covarying A16:U35 base pair was replaced by a G:C pairing. A composite molecule with all three of these mutations was generated, known as ARC1113 (SEQ ID NO 88)., 268579=A variety of different classes of CpG motifs have been identified, each resulting upon recognition in a different cascade of events, release of cytokines and other molecules, and activation of certain cell types. See, e.g., CpG Motifs in Bacterial DNA and Their Immune Effects, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002, 20:709-760, incorporated herein by reference. Additional immunostimulatory motifs are disclosed in the following U.S. Patents, each of which is incorporated herein by reference: U.S. Pat. No. 6,207,646; U.S. Pat. No. 6,239,116; U.S. Pat. No. 6,429,199; U.S. Pat. No. 6,214,806; U.S. Pat. No. 6,653,292; U.S. Pat. No. 6,426,434; U.S. Pat. No. 6,514,948 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,498,148. Any of these CpG or other immunostimulatory motifs can be incorporated into an aptamer. The choice of aptamers is dependent on the disease or disorder to be treated. Preferred immunostimulatory motifs are as follows (shown 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 left to right) wherein \u201cr\u201d designates a purine, \u201cy\u201d designates a pyrimidine, and \u201cX\u201d designates any nucleotide: AACGTTCGAG (SEQ ID NO 4; AACGTT; ACGT, rCGy; rrCGyy, XCGX, XXCGXX, and X1X2CGY1Y2 wherein X1 is G or A, X2 is not C, Y1 is not G and Y2 is preferably T., 320652=Eluted protein was extracted from the RNA mixture with phenol:choloroform, and the pool RNA was precipitated (1 \u03bcL glycogen, 1.5 volume isopropanol). The RNA was reverse transcribed with the ThermoScript RT-PCR\u2122 system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using the 3\u2032 primer according to SEQ ID NO 8. The cDNA was amplified by PCR (20 mM Tris pH 8.4, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 \u03bcM 5\u2032 primer SEQ ID NO 7, 0.5 \u03bcM 3\u2032 primer SEQ ID NO 8, 0.5 mM each dNTP, 0.05 units/\u03bcL Taq polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.). Templates were transcribed using 32P GTP body labeling overnight at 37\ufffd C. The reactions were desalted using Centrisep Spin columns (Princeton Separations, Princeton, N.J.) according to the manufacturer's instructions and purified on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel., 340574=In Example 2A, the PSMA specific aptamer designated ARC955 (G2) that was derived from the rGmH selection described in Example 1 was further optimized via synthetic truncations. The work in Example 2B-Example 2E describes the results of efforts to improve clone A9, an existing PSMA specific aptamer of rRfY composition (2\u2032-OH purines (A and G) and 2\u2032-fluoro pyrimidines (C and U)), denoted as the A9 clone herein, with the following sequence consisting of: 5\u2032GGGAGGACGAUGCGGACCGAAAAAGACCUGAfCfUfUfCfUAfUAfCfUAAGfUfCfUAf CGfUfUfCfCfCAGAfCGAfCfUfCGfCfCfCGA3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO 168) through post-SELEX\u2122 optimization. The A9 clone was described in a patent application having U.S. Ser. No. 09/978,969 filed Oct. 16, 2001 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. The A9 clone (SEQ ID NO 168) was extensively optimized via synthetic truncations (Example 2B), cell-surface doped SELEX\u2122 (Example 2C), engineered mutations (Example 2D), and engineered backbone modifications (Example 2E)., 253818=Other aptamers that bind PSMA are described below in Examples 1-4. While other PSMA binding aptamers are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/978,969 filed Oct. 16, 2001, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/660,514 filed Mar. 7, 2005, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/670,518 filed Apr. 11, 2005; each of which is incorporated by reference herein., 76400=The random sequence portion of the oligonucleotide can be of any length and can comprise ribonucleotides and/or deoxyribonucleotides and can include modified or non-natural nucleotides or nucleotide analogs. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,958,691; U.S. Pat. No. 5,660,985; U.S. Pat. No. 5,958,691; U.S. Pat. No. 5,698,687; U.S. Pat. No. 5,817,635; U.S. Pat. No. 5,672,695, and PCT Publication WO 92/07065. Random oligonucleotides can be synthesized from phosphodiester-linked nucleotides using solid phase oligonucleotide synthesis techniques well known in the art. See, e.g., Froehler et al., Nucl. Acid Res. 14:5399-5467 (1986) and Froehler et al., Tet. Lett. 27:5575-5578 (1986). Random oligonucleotides can also be synthesized using solution phase methods such as triester synthesis methods. See, e.g., Sood et al., Nucl. Acid Res. 4:2557 (1977) and Hirose et al., Tet. Lett., 28:2449 (1978). Typical syntheses carried out on automated DNA synthesis equipment yield 1014-1016 individual molecules, a number sufficient for most SELEX\u2122 experiments. Sufficiently large regions of random sequence in the sequence design increases the likelihood that each synthesized molecule is likely to represent a unique sequence., 129387=The MgCl2 concentration can range from 0.5 mM to 50 mM. The MnCl2 concentration can range from 0.15 mM to 15 mM. Both MgCl2 and MnCl2 must be present within the ranges described and in a preferred embodiment are present in about a 10 to about 3 ratio of MgCl2:MnCl2, preferably, the ratio is about 3-5:1, more preferably, the ratio is about 3-4:1., 287521=Oral dosages of the present invention, when used for the indicated effects, will range between about 0.05 to 7500 mg/day orally. The compositions are preferably provided in the form of scored tablets containing 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100.0, 250.0, 500.0 and 1000.0 mg of active ingredient. Infused dosages, intranasal dosages and transdermal dosages will range between 0.05 to 7500 mg/day. Subcutaneous, intravenous and intraperitoneal dosages will range between 0.05 to 3800 mg/day., 255839=The terms \u201csequence identity\u201d in the context of two or more nucleic acid or protein sequences, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides that are the same, when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence, as measured using one of the following sequence comparison algorithms or by visual inspection. For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are input into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identity for the test sequence(s) relative to the reference sequence, based on the designated program parameters. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, e.g., by the local homology algorithm of Smith & Waterman, Adv. Appl. Math. 2: 482 (1981), by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman & Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson & Lipman, Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 85: 2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by visual inspection (see generally, Ausubel et al., infra)., 486895=Preparation of DM1 conjugates. Cytotoxic conjugates of 5\u2032-amine terminated aptamers with DM1 were synthesized according to the following method: ARC1113, for example, was mixed with DM1 in phosphate buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.21) and acetonitrile. The reaction was monitored by HPLC and excess DM1 was typically added (2-4 equivalents). The reaction was allowed to proceed until the aptamer concentration was <10% of the starting concentration, and remaining unconjugated toxin was removed by Centricolumn or G25 column. Yield varied from 70-90% based on the aptamer., 290542=In addition, the tunability of aptamer pharmacokinetics is used to modify the biodistribution of an aptamer therapeutic in a subject. For example, in some therapeutic applications, it may be desirable to alter the biodistribution of an aptamer therapeutic in an effort to target a particular type of tissue or a specific organ (or set of organs). In these applications, the aptamer therapeutic preferentially accumulates in a specific tissue or organ(s). In other therapeutic applications, it may be desirable to target tissues displaying a cellular marker or a symptom associated with a given disease, cellular injury or other abnormal pathology, such that the aptamer therapeutic preferentially accumulates in the affected tissue. For example, as described in provisional application U.S. Ser. No. 60/550,790, filed on Mar. 5, 2004, and entitled \u201cControlled Modulation of the Pharmacokinetics and Biodistribution of Aptamer Therapeutics\u201d, and in the non-provisional application U.S. Ser. No. 10/______, filed on Mar. 7, 2005, and entitled \u201cControlled Modulation of the Pharmacokinetics and Biodistribution of Aptamer Therapeutics\u201d, PEGylation of an aptamer therapeutic (e.g., PEGylation with a 20 kDa PEG polymer) is used to target inflamed tissues, such that the PEGylated aptamer therapeutic preferentially accumulates in inflamed tissue., 80907=Cycles of selection and amplification are repeated until a desired goal is achieved. In the most general case, selection/amplification is continued until no significant improvement in binding strength is achieved on repetition of the cycle. The method is typically used to sample approximately 1014 different nucleic acid species but may be used to sample as many as about 1018 different nucleic acid species. Generally, nucleic acid aptamer molecules are selected in a 5 to 20 cycle procedure. In one embodiment, heterogeneity is introduced only in the initial selection stages and does not occur throughout the replicating process., 355973=To prepare aptamers for the FACS assay, PSMA aptamers were serially diluted (0-1 uM) in FACS buffer (1\ufffdDPBS w/ Ca++/Mg++ (Gibco, Carlsbad, Calif.) supplemented with 10 mg/mL salmon sperm DNA & 0.2% Na Azide), in a V-bottom 96 well plate, at the concentrations to be tested. LNCaP and PC-3 cells (ATCC, Manassas, Va.) were harvested with trypsin, and 200,000 cells/well were counted, washed once with 1\ufffdDPBS (with Ca++ and Mg++) and resuspended in 200 \u03bcl of FACS Buffer. The 200 \u03bcl of cells in FACS buffer were added to individual wells of a new 96 well plate, pelleted by centrifugation (1300 rpm for 5 minutes), and resuspended in 100 \u03bcl of the appropriate concentration of diluted aptamer. FACS buffer, c-PSMA antibody (3C6) (Northwest Biotherapeutics, Bothell, Wash., Cat #: 60-5002) and an irrelevant fluorescein isothiocyanate (\u201cFITC\u201d) mouse IgG1 isotype control antibody (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif., Cat#: 554679) were used as controls. The wells of aptamer/cell mixture were incubated at room temperature for 20-30 minutes., 149097=Vinca alkaloids: Vinca alkaloids such as vinblastine can be conjugated directly to aldehyde-bearing linkers following conversion to a hydrazide form as described by Brady et al. (J. Med. Chem., 45:4706-4715, 2002). Briefly, vinblastine sulfate is dissolved in 1:1 hydrazine/ethanol and heated to 60\ufffd C.-65\ufffd C. for 22 hours to yield desacetylvinblastine 3-carboxhydrazide (Table 2, DAVCH). Alternatively, amine-reactive forms of vinblastine may be generated in situ as described by Trouet et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,870,162) by (1) initially converting vinblastine sulfate to the desacetyl form (e.g. as described by Brady et al., reacting with 1:3 hydrazine/methanol at 20\ufffd C. for 20 hours), (2) reacting the resulting free base with approximately 2-fold excess succinic anhydride to generate the hemisuccinate (Table 2, DAVS), and (3) reacting with isobutyl chloroformate to form the reactive mixed anhydride., 494520=Methods. LNCaP and PC-3 cells (ATCC, Manassas, Va.) were cultured in RPMI-1640 (ATCC) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, Carlsbad, Calif.). Media from LNCaP (PSMA+) or PC3 (PSMA\u2212) cells growing in 15 cm plates was aspirated off then cells were washed with 10 mL 1\ufffdPBS. Cells were trypsinized for 30 sec at 37\ufffd C. Following trypsinization, 8 mL 10% FBS media was used to quench trypsin. Cells were spun at 1000 rpm for 3.30 min. Following spin the media was aspirated off and the cell pellet was re-suspended with 10 mL complete media. The cell density was adjusted to 200,000 cells/mL. 50 \u03bcl of cells/well was added to collagen coated black 96-well plates (10,000 cells/well). Cells were incubated at 37\ufffd C. in 5% CO2 for 24 hrs to allow adequate adherence. Following overnight incubation 25 \u03bcl of media, aptamer or antibody was added to each well with the final volume in the well being 100 \u03bcl and incubated at 37\ufffd C. in 5% CO2 for designated time length. Following incubation cells were washed three times with complete media and further incubated at 37\ufffd C. in 5% CO2 for 48 hrs. After 2 days 20 \u03bcl BrdU labeling reagent (100\ufffd) is mixed with 2 mL of complete media. 10 \u03bcl of BrdU labeling reagent mixture was added to each well, and the cells were incubated with BrdU at 37\ufffd C. in 5% CO2 for 2.5 hrs. After incubation, the media was removed, and the assay was completed following the manufacturer's protocol: 200 \u03bcl/well FixDenat solution was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at RT. Following removal of FixDenat solution 100 \u03bcl anti-BrdU POD Fab fragment solution (Luminol/4-iodophenol) was added to each well and incubated for 90 min at RT. After incubation anti-BrdU POD solution was removed and plates were washed with 200 \u03bcl/well of washing solution three times with 5 min RT incubations. 100 \u03bcl of substrate solution was added to each well and cells were incubated for 3 min at RT in the dark. The plates were read using a luminescence program with a 1 sec count on a Packard TopCount Microplate Scintillation and Luminescence Counter., 297553=The aptamer compositions of the invention may be derivatized with polyalkylene glycol (\u201cPAG\u201d) moieties. Examples of PAG-derivatized nucleic acids are found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/718,833, filed on Nov. 21, 2003, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Typical polymers used in the invention include polyethylene glycol (\u201cPEG\u201d), also known as polyethylene oxide (\u201cPEO\u201d) and polypropylene glycol (including poly isopropylene glycol). Additionally, random or block copolymers of different alkylene oxides (e.g., ethylene oxide and propylene oxide) can be used in many applications. In its most common form, a polyalkylene glycol, such as PEG, is a linear polymer terminated at each end with hydroxyl groups: HO\u2014CH2CH2O\u2014(CH2CH2O)n\u2014CH2CH2\u2014OH. This polymer, alpha-, omega-dihydroxylpolyethylene glycol, can also be represented as HO-PEG-OH, where it is understood that the -PEG- symbol represents the following structural unit: \u2014CH2CH2O\u2014(CH2CH2O)n\u2014CH2CH2\u2014 where n typically ranges from about 4 to about 10,000., 294585=Aptamers can be conjugated to a variety of modifying moieties, such as high molecular weight polymers, e.g., PEG; peptides, e.g., Tat (a 13-amino acid fragment of the HIV Tat protein (Vives, et al. (1997), J. Biol. Chem. 272(25): 16010-7)), Ant (a 16-amino acid sequence derived from the third helix of the Drosophila antennapedia homeotic protein (Pietersz, et al. (2001), Vaccine 19(11-12): 1397-405)) and Arg7 (a short, positively charged cell-permeating peptides composed of polyarginine (Arg7) (Rothbard, et al. (2000), Nat. Med. 6(11): 1253-7; Rothbard, J et al. (2002), J. Med. Chem. 45(17): 3612-8)); and small molecules, e.g., lipophilic compounds such as cholesterol. Among the various conjugates described herein, in vivo properties of aptamers are altered most profoundly by complexation with PEG groups. For example, complexation of a mixed 2\ufffd F. and 2\u2032-OMe modified aptamer therapeutic with a 20 kDa PEG polymer hinders renal filtration and promotes aptamer distribution to both healthy and inflamed tissues. Furthermore, the 20 kDa PEG polymer-aptamer conjugate proves nearly as effective as a 40 kDa PEG polymer in preventing renal filtration of aptamers. While one effect of PEGylation is on aptamer clearance, the prolonged systemic exposure afforded by presence of the 20 kDa moiety also facilitates distribution of aptamer to tissues, particularly those of highly perfused organs and those at the site of inflammation. The aptamer-20 kDa PEG polymer conjugate directs aptamer distribution to the site of inflammation, such that the PEGylated aptamer preferentially accumulates in inflamed tissue. In some instances, the 20 kDa PEGylated aptamer conjugate is able to access the interior of cells, such as, for example, kidney cells., 35721=Until recently, Novantron\ufffd (mitoxantrone), administered in combination with prednisone, was the standard of care for AIPC. In clinical trials supporting development of Novantron\ufffd, palliation response was the primary endpoint; survival, lesion size change, PSA level decline, and QOL were secondary endpoints. The pivotal studies supporting registration showed modest efficacy in terms of the palliation response endpoint and secondary endpoints, but no effect on survival. In May, 2004 the FDA approved Taxotere\ufffd (docetaxel) injection in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with androgen independent metastatic prostate cancer. Safety and effectiveness of Taxotere was established in a randomized, multi-center global clinical trial with over 1,000 patients comparing chemotherapy with Taxotere\ufffd and prednisone, to mitoxantrone and prednisone, in men with metastatic, androgen independent prostate cancer. Taxotere\ufffd, in combination with prednisone, given every three weeks showed a survival advantage of approximately 2.5 months over the control group in the trial. This is the first drug approved for hormone refractory prostate cancer that has shown any survival benefit, although minimal., 434921=The modifications from Phase 1 through Phase 3 were combined to yield ARC1725. ARC1113 is a ribo-containing aptamer based on ARC 591 with fully-stabilized helical stems and a 3\u2032-cap (3\u2032-idT). ARC1725 is a ribo-free version based on ARC591, in which ribos have been systematically replaced by DNA, 2\u2032-O-Me, and a phosphorothioate. Surprisingly the fully-ribo free molecule does not have significantly improved stability relative to the parent ARC1113 in this assay (11 hrs. vs. 20 hrs.)., 432627=Plasma stability of each construct was measured using a plasma stability time course assay over 0, 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 hours. A reaction was set up for each aptamer tested in an eppendorf tube using 95% human plasma (20 \u03bcl per time point), an appropriate concentration of aptamer (determined by the highest predicted dosing level (CMax)), and a sufficient amount of spiked 5\u2032-end labeled aptamer such that a 1:10 dilution of the reaction will be over 1000 cpm, brought to total volume with 1\ufffdPBS. When assembling the reaction, the plasma was added last, and the reactions were immediately added to a 37\ufffd C. heat block. A reaction for each aptamer tested containing 1\ufffdPBS instead of plasma was used as a 0 hour time point. At each designated time point, 20 \u03bcl was withdrawn from each reaction and added to an appropriately labeled eppendorf tube containing 200 \u03bcl of formamide loading dye, and was immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221220\ufffd C. After all the samples were collected, 20 \u03bcl of each plasma sample/loading dye was aliquoted into separate tubes, and 2 \u03bcl of 1% SDS was added to each tube (final SDS concentration 0.1%). The samples containing 0.1% SDS were heated at 90\ufffd C. for 10-15 minutes. Subsequently, 15 \u03bcl of each of the heated samples were loaded on a 15% PAGE gel, leaving an empty lane in between each aptamers' time course. The PAGE gel was run at 12 W for 35 minutes in order to keep all of the labeled material on the gel. When the gel was finished running, it was exposed to a phosphor-imaging screen and scanned on a Storm860 phosphorimaging machine (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, Calif.)., 321969=The pool RNA was gel purified every round. Transcription reactions were quenched with 50 mM EDTA and ethanol precipitated then purified on a 1.5 mm denaturing polyacrylamide gels (8 M urea, 10% acrylamide; 19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide). Pool RNA was removed from the gel by passively eluting gel fragments in 300 mM NaAc and 20 mM EDTA overnight. The eluted material was precipitated by adding 2.5 volumes of ethanol and 1 \u03bcl of glycogen., 260879=The aptamers of the present invention can be synthesized using any oligonucleotide synthesis techniques known in the art including solid phase oligonucleotide synthesis techniques well known in the art (see, e.g., Froehler et al., Nucl. Acid Res. 14:5399-5467 (1986) and Froehler et al., Tet. Lett. 27:5575-5578 (1986)) and solution phase methods such as triester synthesis methods (see, e.g., Sood et al., Nucl. Acid Res. 4:2557 (1977) and Hirose et al., Tet. Lett., 28:2449 (1978))., 89903=In further embodiments, the oligonucleotides comprise modified sugar groups, for example, one or more of the hydroxyl groups is replaced with halogen, aliphatic groups, or functionalized as ethers or amines. In one embodiment, the 2\u2032-position of the furanose residue is substituted by any of an O-methyl, O-alkyl, O-allyl, S-alkyl, S-allyl, or halo group. Methods of synthesis of 2\u2032-modified sugars are described, e.g., in Sproat, et al., Nucl. Acid Res. 19:733-738 (1991); Cotten, et al., Nucl. Acid Res. 19:2629-2635 (1991); and Hobbs, et al., Biochemistry 12:5138-5145 (1973). Other modifications are known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such modifications may be pre-SELEX\u2122 process modifications or post-SELEX\u2122 process modifications (modification of previously identified unmodified ligands) or may be made by incorporation into the SELEX\u2122 process., 135710=In one embodiment, the therapeutic aptamer-drug conjugates of the invention are used in the targeted killing of tumor cells through aptamer-mediated delivery of cytotoxins. The efficiency of cell killing is improved if the target tumor marker is a marker that readily internalizes or recycles into the tumor cell. Aptamer-toxin molecules have been described generally in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/826,077, filed on Apr. 15, 2004,f U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/600,007 filed Jun. 18, 2003, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/390,042 filed Jun. 18, 2002 each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety., 26943=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/826,077, filed on Apr. 15, 2004, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/600,007 filed Jun. 18, 2003, which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd 119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/390,042 filed Jun. 18, 2002. This application also claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd119(e) to the following provisional patent applications: U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/660,514 filed Mar. 7, 2005, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/670,518 filed Apr. 11, 2005; each of which is incorporated by reference herein., 319607=SELEX\u2122. The selection was initiated by incubating of 2\ufffd1014 molecules of 2\u2032-OH G, 2\u2032-OMe A, C, U modified ARC356 pool (rGmH composition) with 20 pmoles of ECD PSMA protein in a final volume of 100 \u03bcl selection buffer (1\ufffdSHMCK buffer: 20 mM Hepes, 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4) with trace amounts of \u03b1-32P rGTP labeled RNA for 1 hour at room temperature. RNA-protein complexes and unbound RNA molecules were separated using 100 \u03bcl of Ni-NTA (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.) bead slurry that was pre-washed and equilibrated with 3\ufffd300 \u03bcl of SHMCK buffer. The RNA/protein solution was then added to the beads and bound for 1 hour at room temperature. The beads were then washed with 2\ufffd500 \u03bcl of 1\ufffdSCHMK buffer, which was removed by filtering beads/wash solution through a 0.2 \u03bcM filter (Millipore, Billerica, Mass.) The RNA was eluted from the beads by addition of 2\ufffd100 \u03bcL of 1\ufffdSCHMK buffer additionally containing 250 mM Imidazole pH 7.4., 373754=Extraction and amplification. Cell pellets isolated by FACS were resuspended with 500 \u03bcl elution buffer (5 M urea, 300 mM NaOAc, 50 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) and RNA was subsequently extracted with 500 \u03bcl acid phenol (pH \u02dc5), back extracted with 400 \u03bcl Tris-EDTA buffer, and 800 \u03bcl chloroform. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and precipitated with 3 M Na Acetate, 2.5 volumes ethanol, and 1 \u03bcl glycogen. The isolated pellet was resuspended with 100 \u03bcl water, desalted twice using G25 spin columns (GE, Piscataway, N.J.) and used as subsequent input for a reverse transcription reaction cocktail containing the following: 120 \u03bcl extracted RNA, 2.5 \u03bcl 100 \u03bcM reverse primer 5\u2032-TGGAATCGACCTCGGGCG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO 29), 5 \u03bcl 10 mM dNTPs. The reaction mixture was incubated at 65\ufffd C. for 3 min, followed by addition of the following: 50 \u03bcl 5\ufffd reverse transcription buffer, 25 \u03bcl 0.1 M DTT, 12.5 \u03bcl RNAseOUT, 10 \u03bcl Thermoscript\u2122 reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif. #11146-024), 25 \u03bcl H2O. The complete reaction mix was incubated at 65\ufffd C. for 60 minutes and heat killed by incubation at 85\ufffd C. for 10 minutes., 94559=Aptamers that contain 2\u2032-O-methyl (\u201c2\u2033-OMe\u201d) nucleotides, as provided herein, overcome many of these drawbacks. Oligonucleotides containing 2\u2032-OMe nucleotides are nuclease-resistant and inexpensive to synthesize. Although 2\u2032-OMe nucleotides are ubiquitous in biological systems, natural polymerases do not accept 2\u2032-OMe NTPs as substrates under physiological conditions, thus there are no safety concerns over the recycling of 2\u2032-OMe nucleotides into host DNA. The SELEX\u2122 method used to generate 2\u2032-modified aptamers is described, e.g., in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/430,761, filed Dec. 3, 2002, U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/487,474, filed Jul. 15, 2003, U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/517,039, filed Nov. 4, 2003, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/729,581, filed Dec. 3, 2003, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/873,856, filed Jun. 21, 2004, entitled \u201cMethod for in vitro Selection of 2\u2032-O-methyl Substituted Nucleic Acids\u201d, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.}",

Functional, non-toxin conjugated aptamers specific for PSMA, ARC955 and ARC942, were shown in this assay to have no intrinsic effect on cell viability at any concentration. A vinblastine conjugate of an arbitrary oligonucleotide sequence (ARC725) with a nucleotide composition similar to ARC1142 but no intrinsic PSMA binding similarly failed to show cell killing over the entire concentration range. Vinblastine conjugates of both functional PSMA aptamers, ARC1142 and ARC1026, on the other hand, were able to induce complete cell killing at moderate to low concentrations (10-500 nM) with the ARC955 (G2) derivative showing approximately 30-fold better potency than the ARC942 (A9) derivative. Vinblastine conjugates of both functional PSMA aptamers, ARC1142 and ARC1026, had little to no",
