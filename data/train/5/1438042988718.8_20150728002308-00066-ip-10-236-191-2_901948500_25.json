    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Artistic, open-minded, works better in smaller environments (academically), loves to be involved with community, loves diverse culture. Tips for prospective students the more background you have in art, the better it is to do well at CCA. it is best to prepare a portfolio before your senior year in high school so you have less to worry about when you apply to schools. portfolios should contain your best works. try to show all the different types of mediums you know how to use (paints, graphite, digital media, etc) and your different artistic skills (through drawing, video editing, animation, painting). remember to let yourself show through your artworks. as for gpa/grades/sat scores/ap scores, try to do well in school and testing. the more well-rounded you are, the more appealing you will be to the school. also, it increases your chances of getting more scholarships! Bang for the buck Most students get financial aid or scholarships if they're a US citizen or permanent resident, so tuition isn't too expensive, but international students have to pay the full tuition price. Am enjoying being here although there arent many student organizations, there are lots of things to do",
