            "Carthage is great for education, science, and art students, but I am planning on working in historic preservation, and I still can find classes that I can use to work toward that career goal, though the history department is not the key department.",
            "If you are a prospective student, remember to file FAFSA and to apply for all the aid and scholarships you can for as long as you can. It may be a hassle, but the money is worth it. Also, tell the college all they ask for, and I would also suggest taking tours and meeting with staff or students or your high school advisor if you have one.",
            "It is expensive, but if you get some sort of scholarship, its a little easier, and there are tons of on-campus or off-campus jobs. In that way, it is possible to attend and also have time to make money. They give us a good experience that is proportional to what we pay for.",
            "I love the small size of the campus. Its nice because I just need to walk down to our new Union and I will very likely see someone I know either from class or just a friend. The setting of the campus is great, and is relaxing, despite the extreme cold of the winter. I love the students, and ALL of the buildings are well kept and nice, because they spend money on that and so we get buildings that are not falling apart and that look nice.",
            "I am really learning about the things I wanted to. The professors want to help you achieve your goals and they are not just there to get paid. They enjoy teaching and give students quality classes, never taught by TA's."

The professors know who you are and when you are attending class. It is great for students who wish to be known by their professors and would like to ask for extra help at certain times. Tips for prospective students Carthage College is a great school if you want to come to class. With larger schools, you can not show up for class and the professor will probably not notice, however, at Carthage, the professors know who you are and will know if you are missing. Carthage is also great if you want personal attention and may need or want extra help and advice after class hours. Bang for the buck",
