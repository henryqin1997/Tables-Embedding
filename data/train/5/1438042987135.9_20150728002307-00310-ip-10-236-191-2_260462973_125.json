    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{253404=Royal 20's is a side bet that came out in 2003 with several placements. The bet seemed to fade away but in December 2012 I noticed it at the Gold Coast. It is a pair of side bets, one on the player and one on the dealer. Each wins if the first two cards form 20 points, including a soft 20. I would think that any casino offering this side bet would put it on a continuous shuffer., 296682=Sign seen at the Silver Dollar casino near the Seattle airport in June 2007. It would read \"Side-bets are strictly prohibited\", if it were spelled correctly., 247513=House Money 21 is a side bet by game inventor Roger Snow of Shufflemaster. As of this writing (September 2012), it is reported to be at the Pala Casino near San Diego, the Siena in Reno, and the Drift On Inn in Washington., 68538=I noticed this third version of Bonus Blackjack at the Riviera casino on November 17, 2012. It was played on a single-deck game. Wins are based on the player's first two cards, and for the highest win, on the dealer's cards as well. The following table shows everything you need to know., 277862=I'm not sure if the correct title of this side bet is \"Let's Play,\" \"Let's Play AKQJ,\" or \"100K ... Let's Play.\" Whatever the name, I first saw it at the Eureka Casino in Mesquite NV on January 3, 2014. It usually pays based on the player's first two cards, with the top pay also involving the dealer's first two cards. The following return table, based on two decks, shows all the specifics. The lower right cell shows a house edge of 11.01%., 44102=For a $1 bet, every other player at the table (not counting yourself) increases the expected return by 0.001662. If the player bets more than $1, then divide that increase by the amount bet., 280919=Lucky Eights is a side bet that was reported to be at the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore in May, 2014. It pays based on the player's first two cards and the dealer's up card. The following return table for six decks shows a house edge of 7.66%., 96027=\"2 Through 6\" is a side bet I noticed at the Four Queens on April 24, 2004. Except as noted all winnings hands involve a dealer up card of 2 through 6. The following table shows all the winning events, permutations, probability, payoff, and contribution to the return. The lower right cell shows a house edge of 7.48%., 44306=For a $1 bettor, the jackpot break-even point is $8,347.58, less $50 for every additional player at the table. When I saw this bet on April 20, 2013 the meter was at $7,817.44., 272389=This is a set of side bets I noticed at the Palms casino in Managua, Nicaragua, on April 29, 2013. The bets had no name so I'm taking the liberty of calling them the \"Dealer Total\" bets. There are five bets available on the final dealer total, ranging from 17 to 21. The bets may be made after seeing the dealer's up card. However, the player may not bet on the up card plus ten. For example, if the up card is a seven, then the player can't bet on 17. Here is what each total pays., 229541=I noticed this side bet at Arizona Charlie's on Decatur on February 23, 2012. It is a pair of bets, mostly paying based on the color of the dealer's up card. However, there are exceptions for kings, queens, and threes. The following two return tables show the odds of all possible outcomes. The number of decks does not matter., 60756=Sweet Sixteen is a blackjack side bet I noticed at the Las Vegas Club in April 2001. It is played with a six-deck shoe and pays based on the player's first two cards. The following table shows each paying hand, the probability, payoff, and contribution to the total return., 40721=I noticed this variation of Bet the Set on April 19, 2013 at the Red Rock casino in Las Vegas. It was dealt from a six-deck game. The bet wins if the player has a pair for his initial two cards, more if they are suited. Unlike the normal Bet the Set, if the player has a pair he has a chance for big wins if the dealer also has a pair of the same rank., 150367=21 to the River is a blackjack side bet I noticed at the Hard Rock in Las Vegas on March 27, 2008. The rules are as follows., 262175=This is a simple bet I noticed at the Palms casino in Managua, Nicaragua, on April 29, 2013. The bet was titled Apuesta de 20. It pays 7 to 1 if the total of the dealer's first two cards is 20, including a soft 20. The following table shows the probability of winning and expected return for one to eight decks. The Palms uses six decks, for a house edge of 15.31%., 123765=Version 2 of this is a side bet I noticed at the Eldorado casino in Henderson on March 16, 2007. It was played on a six-deck game., 192469=The Block bet is based on the player's first two cards and the dealer's up card. As of this writing (Nov. 2010) it can be found in South Africa, Egypt, Latvia, Estonia, Ireland, and Morocco. The bet wins if the dealer's up card matches the suit of one of the player's cards, and the player's card is higher. There are higher pays if the player's cards are a pair, suited, or both. Here is how the various winning hands are defined., 129519=Automatic Win/Casino Surrender is an optional rule in blackjack in which the player may force the dealer to surrender when the player has a 2-card 20 against a dealer 10. This option is known by both names. In other words the player may play out his hand or settle for a win of 50% of his bet. The option may only be invoked after the dealer checks for blacjack. The Stardust in Las Vegas has been seen offering this rule in May 2005., 264268=This is a side bet I noticed at the Palms casino in Managua, Nicaragua, on April 29, 2013. The bet was titled Casa Demasiado, which means \"house too much.\" The bet wins if the dealer busts. The win depends on what the dealer's up card is, as follows:, 225750=I have an unconfirmed report that this side bet was seen at Freddie's Club in Fife, Washington in February, 2012. It is a side bet that the player will bust on the next card. The bet may be made on player totals of 12 to 16. The odds a winning bet pays depends on the player's total as shown in the table below., 162885=Buster Blackjack is a side bet I noticed at the Sycuan casino, near San Diego, on November 30, 2008. The bet wins if the dealer busts, the more cards it takes, the more the player wins. The following table shows the probabilities and return for a six-deck game, where the dealer hits a soft 17. The lower right cell shows a house edge of 6.21%., 62709=Dare any Pair is a side bet I noticed at the Lady Luck in April 2001. It simply pays 11 to 1 if the player's first two cards are a pair. Six decks are used. The probability of a pair is 0.073954984 for a house edge of 11.25%. Here is the house edge for other numbers of decks., 14834=Streak is an optional blackjack side bet I noticed at Caesars in Atlantic City in April of 2000. Since that time I have seen it displayed at the Global Gaming Expo, where I have been given rule updates. Streak is a simple bet on winning a specified number of consecutive bets. If the player splits then it is the net win that counts toward whether the hand as a whole won or lost. For example if the player split and won one hand and pushed the other the hand would count as a net win. In the event of a push or breaking even after a split the hand would not count for purposes of the side bet, neither advancing the number of consecutive wins nor breaking the winning streak. The player may bet on a winning streak from 2 to 5, or as many of these as desired., 70967=As the name implies, this is a blackjack side bet with a progressive jackpot. For an optional $1, the blackjack player may win $3 to the progressive jackpot, which starts at $25,000. I saw this side bet at the New York New York casino, where they had three tables tied into the same progressive. On July 30, 2001, the jackpot meter was at $35,537.36. At this time, I was told they recently put it in place and nobody had hit the jackpot yet. On August 11 the meter had risen to $37,746.28., 45673=In August 2010 I noticed another version of side betting on a tie in blackjack at Harrah's Las Vegas. Unlike version 1, where all ties pay 10 to 1, at Harrah's you could bet on all six possible ties individually, or on a low or a high tie. As I recall, the rules were:, 65518=This is another side bet called \"Bonus Blackjack.\" I noticed it at the Sycuan casino near San Diego on October 25, 2009. The only bet amounts permitted were 50\u00a2 and $1. The following table shows the pay table, probabilities, and return for a six-deck game. The lower right cell shows a house edge of 40.78% (ouch!). This assumes the player always tries for a 678 or 777 if possible, even if it violates basic strategy. The cost of such strategy deviations are not indicated., 143461=2 Run 21 is a blackjack side bet I noticed at the Silver Dollar casino in Seattle on June 5, 2007. It pays based on the player's first two cards, and the dealer's first two cards., 146968=In May 2008 I had an unconfirmed report that the above table is no longer the one in use. The writer claims the side bet is now based on only the player's first two cards, and the dealer's up card., 23576=After going 13 years without seeing the Streak bet I suddenly saw it, under another name, at the Palms casino in Managua, Nicaragua, on April 29, 2013. There it is called the Fuego bet, which means fire. They use a different pay table, as shown in the following pay table. For splitting, they use the first hand played out for purposes of the Streak bet. Otherwise, the rules are a little different, but still use six decks and the dealer stands on a soft 17. To simplify the analysis, I'm going to assume the same 47.51% of a net win as I do under the Atlantic City rules., 257009=I noticed Suit 'em Up at the Red Rock casino in Las Vegas on April 19, 2013. It was on a double-deck table. As long as the player's first two cards are suited he wins, with wins ranging from 2-1 to 60-1., 49003=Version 1 of 21+3 I noticed at the Las Vegas Hilton in April, 2001. The side bet pays based on the player's first two cards and the dealer's up card. If the three cards equal a flush, straight, straight flush, or three of a kind the side bet pays 9 to 1. The following table shows the probability of each hand in a six-deck game,as played at the Hilton., 139670=\"Straight 8's\" is a blackjack side bet seen in Calgary in March 2007. Like the Lucky Lucky, it pays based on the player's first two cards and the dealer's up card., 251179=Wild Aces is a side bet I heard started at the Golden Nugget in October, 2012. Here are the rules., 305685=Copyright \u00a9 1998-2015 Wizard of Odds Consulting, Inc. All rights reserved. Privacy & Terms., 189239=The 3 Card Hard Hand is a side bet I noticed at the Boulder Station in Las Vegas on September 16, 2010. Much like the Lucky Lucky, it pays based on the player's first two cards and the dealer's up card. Aces may count as 1 or 11 points. The following table shows the pay table, probability of each win, and contribution to the total return, based on a six-deck game. The lower right cell shows a house edge of 4.27%., 271664=I noticed the roulette bets, or ruleta in Spanish, at the Palms casino in Managua, Nicaragua, on April 29, 2013. They are side bets on the next dealer card. Interestingly, they may be made at any point the dealer is about to draw a card. Bets on an ace to 9 pay 10 to 1, and any 10-point card pays 2 to 1., 147231=Winners Option is a side bet seen at the Las Vegas Hard Rock in August, 2007. In addition to playing blackjack normally, the player may bet on the dealer's hand. Unfortunately, you can't deliberately lose your own hand, in this case. If you bet on the dealer, as indicated on the table by a \"D\" arrow, then you must play according to the same rules as the dealer, never doubling or splitting, and hitting to hard 17 or soft 18. In the event both player and dealer bust, the bet will lose half., 121709=Version 1 of this is a side bet I noticed at the MGM Grand on November 26, 2005. It was played on a six-deck game., 214909=When I saw this bet at the Suncoast it was on a two-deck game, where the dealer hits a soft 17. The meter on November 3, 2011 was at $8,888.44. Thus, the return at the time was 0.53919057 + (8888.44/10000)\u00d70.124964643 = 68.34%., 236909=Dealer Bust 21 is a side bet I noticed at the Tropicana on September 13, 2012. I am also told it can be found at the Fiesta Henderson. The wins pay according to the dealer's up card, as follows., 169206=Super Split is a blackjack side bet I noticed at the Viejas casino in California on December 1, 2008. It was closed at the time, so I don't know the number of decks used. The following return table is based on a six-deck game. The lower right cell shows a house edge of 23.40%., 131709=\"Bust It\" is a side bet seen at the Taj Majal in Atlanic City in April, 2007. In July 2010 I saw it at the Wynn in Las Vegas. The side bet can not exceed the lesser of the blackjack bet and $25. It wins if the dealer busts on the third card. The side bet is available on ordinary blackjack and Double Attack Blackjack, which uses a Spanish deck. It does not matter whether dealer hits or stands on soft 17, because either way busting with three cards is impossible on a two-card soft 17. Card counters may be interested to know that the dealer is more likely to bust when the count is high. So at some positive count the odds would swing to the player's favor., 77839=Twin blackjack is not a side bet, but a variation of the game of blackjack. I saw the game at the Stardust in August, 2001. Each position has two betting spots. If the player makes a bet in both of them he will play out two hands against the dealer's up card. In the event the player gets two blackjacks (called twin blackjacks) they both shall pay 2-1. If the player gets two identical blackjacks (called identical twin blackjacks) both shall pay 4-1.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Royal Match \u2014 Version 1 \u2014 Six Decks The royal match is a simple bet that pays a bonus if the first two cards are suited (an easy match) and a top bonus for a suited king and queen (a royal match). Below are probability tables for two versions I have seen. Royal Match Crazy Sevens is the same thing as Super Sevens but with a different pay table. Both are addressed in my Super Sevens page. Crazy Sevens Information about this bet has been moved to my page on Super Sevens. Super Sevens This appendix shall explain and analyze some blackjack side bets I have seen.

The number of two card combinations is combin(52\u00d7n,2). The number of ways to make a royal match is 4*n2. This is because there are 4 suits and n ways to choose the queen and n ways to choose the king. The number of ways to make an easy match is 4\u00d7(combin(13\u00d7n,2)-n2). The 4 is the number of suits and combin(13\u00d7n,2) is the number of ways to arrange 2cards from a given suit. You must also subtract the number of ways to make a royal match. The probability of an easy match is 4\u00d7(combin(13\u00d7n,2)-n2)/combin(52\u00d7n,2). The probability of a royal match is 4\u00d7n2/combin(52\u00d7n,2). Royal Match - Version 3 In a third version there is a separate pay for a suited blackjack as follows. Royal Match pays 25 to 1 Suited Blackjack pays 5 to 1 Easy Match pays 5 to 2 The following table shows the expected value for a 6-deck game is -3.70%.
