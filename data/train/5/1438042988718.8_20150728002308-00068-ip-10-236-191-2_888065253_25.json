            "Most of the Security guards on campus are super nice and helpful. They always respond or come to assit students in less than 10 minutes. The area doesn't have the greatest reputation for being safe but the campus is well lit.",
            "The Rogalski food court is convenient and they have a good selection. It's not the cheapest though.",
            "Ambrose has pretty buildings and a beautiful campus. They just built a new dorm building on the corner of Lombard and Harrison. They have town houses on campus as well.",
            "If you complete your work, try, and attend classes, you'll most likely pass you courses.",
            "Ambrose is about community. It's small, students and teachers create close relationships and are very helpful. The staff and professors are encouraging and are knowledgable in their focused field."

I have learned and exponential amount since starting here in 2009 and the marketing/music programs are phenomenal. Having a degree from this university will certainly put a boost in my resume, 38095=The food is good, there is a lot of variety, although it can get boring after a year or two, but the cafeteria can get crowded. Luckily, the school is expanding it now for Fall 2012., 150343=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 140908=At ambrose it get into their PT or OT program you must have a 3.5 gpa or higher so you need to pull off good grades. For nursing you must have a 3.0 or higher. When looking at the nursing program when visiting it seems great! but being a nursing student there is awful!! they keep changing their teachers and the head of the department which makes it hard on the students. I went in as a freshman in 2012 with a certain list of pre reqs and they got a new head of the department my sophomore year and now the prereqs have changed so i wasted money and time on classes that I no longer need. So then you get behind. It was just an aweful experience and not only i have left but many other people have left ambrose and i know of 4 people male and female leaving in spring of 2014, 3236=ambrose has campus security 24 hours, 7 days a week. they also have student security at night before per mar comes to ensure that people who are not supposed to be in the residence halls do not get it. ambrose also has a great residence life staff that does rounds every night of the week to make sure that students are having a fun and safe college experience, 59855=Students pay and get a bang for their buck. Staff is friendly and helpful to all students. there is an 11:1 student to faculty member ratio. Small classes and individual attention are a primacy here.}",
