Like before, you should make your bars in the hundreds- collecting 1000 coal and 500 iron is a good place to stop getting the ores and making bars. When you have 48 smithing, make the bars into steel plate bodies. Now, if you are mining your own ores, you will make some decent cash. You can sell steel plate bodies in bulk to people with 55 magic for 1000-900 gp each- they use high alchemy on them to train magic. Continue making steel plates. This may be the best way to train smithing for a while. You probably shouldn't train using mithril until you can make mithril platebodies, which go for 3000 each for high-alching., 265587=Copyright Notice: All content is copyright \u00a9 2003 - 2015 by RuneHQ, a Global Gaming HQ LLC company.
