The league again took the field in 1946, lasting through 1961. A class B league from 1902 throughout its lifespan, no league survived for as long at that level. The end of World War II proved a boon to minor league baseball in the United States. In 1945, there were but a dozen minor leagues in the nation. Four years later, there were a record 59 leagues in 448 communities. During this period, the Three-I enjoyed relative stability. Waterloo drew a single-season club record of 174,000 in 1947. Three years later, the league set an all-time attendance record of almost 783,000., 613=In the 1950s, with competition from television and the manpower drain of the Korean War, minor leagues throughout the nation began folding. With the end approaching, the league was the Three-I in name only, as no Illinois or Indiana cities were represented after 1957 and teams from Minnesota, Kansas, and Nebraska joined its ranks. The Three-I League suspended operations after the 1961 season, marking the end of the nation's oldest Class B league. Some 31 cities had fielded teams in the 61 year run of one of Minor League Baseball's showcase league's.}",
