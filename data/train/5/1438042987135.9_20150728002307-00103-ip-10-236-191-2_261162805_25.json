Sailor Moon R was dubbed and aired a year later. When the last episode of Sailor Moon R was aired, with the preview of the third season, fans expected to see the new episodes the next day, but the show stopped. A year later, without trailers or publicity announcing it, the third season was aired, again in Antena 3, but at 7:00 am, an unpopular time slot. Some seasons were also aired again, in different time slots., 12249=In the next few years, the dub studio Vulpi-Yuri ceased to exist, so the Spanish audience had to wait until 2000 to see any new episodes, although the R movie was released on VHS between the airing of the R and S seasons. Then Sailor Moon SuperS was dubbed by Tecnison and aired twice on the Antena 3 television station in the 7:00 am time slot., 12607=In 2002, Arait Multimedia bought the rights to Sailor Moon, and dubbed the fifth season. Sailor Moon Sailor Stars was aired on Canal Sur 2 Andaluc\u00eda, a channel from the Andalusia region (Arait Multimedia, Tecnison, and Vulpi-Yuri were based in Madrid) that could be watched in most of Spain's autonomous communities. It was aired at 2:30 pm, a more favorable time slot.}",
