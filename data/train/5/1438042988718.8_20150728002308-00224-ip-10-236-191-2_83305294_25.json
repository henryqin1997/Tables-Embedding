    "textBeforeTable": "Socionics is a science of information metabolism types and intertype relations between them. The subject of socionics is the study of information exchange between a person and external and internal world and also between people as information metabolism types. Socionics method is diagnostics of a human psyche structure and the analysis of information metabolism processes according to socionics models. Socionics has appeared as a logical sequel of the theories by Z.Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis and the Swiss psychiatrists C.G. Jung. The short description of the socionics basis can sound like that. Freud has brought in the science the idea that a human psyche has its structure. He described this structure as follows: conscious (ego), preconscious (super-ego) and subconscious (id). Basing on his experience with patients Jung noticed that such structures have different filling with different people. Jung classified the stable, possibly inherent, differences in behaviour, abilities, susceptibility to illnesses, peculiarities in appearances. Studying all these specific features Jung has constructed not one, as Freud had done, but eight, psyche models and described on their basis eight psychological types. C.G. Jung constructed his typology on the basis of two tendencies: extraversion - introversion and four functions thinking, feeling, intuition, sensation Jung examined each of the four psychological functions in two tendencies: in extraverted and introverted variants. He defined eight psychological types in accordance with these eight functions. He stated:",
    "textAfterTable": "The terms extraversion and introversion should not be identified with the level of communication or keeping oneself to oneself. As could be seen in the definitions given by Jung himself, communicability and unsociability in these categories are far from being the main things. Communicability can be based either on the interest to other people (extraverted) or the interest to useful and attractive information for the person (introverted). There are extraverted people preferring to watch objects from a distance. And, vice versa, an introvert can be very sociable thus making the inner comfort for himself. Next Jung described four psychological functions. He wrote: \u201cI was asked, even with a reproach, why I speak about exactly four functions, no more, no less. First, their number appeared just empirically. But the fact that they gave a certain degree of integrity can be proved by the following idea. Sensation states what is going on in fact. Thinking lets us learn what it means. Feeling shows its value. And, finally, intuition directs at possible \u201cwhere from\u201d and \u201cwhere\u201d, existing in present. Due to that the orientation in the modern world can be as full as determining a place in an area with the help of geographic coordinates\u201d. [1]. Sensation What in fact is going on? Thinking What does it mean?",
