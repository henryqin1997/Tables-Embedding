The samples investigated in this study were synthesized by using solid-state reaction (SSR) and self-heat-sustained (SHS) techniques. These samples were sintered at a temperature (T ) ranging between 1200 \u00b0C and 1600 \u00b0C with a soak-time (t) ranging between 2 h and 60 h. The ac immittance (impedance or admittance) measurements were conducted on these sintered bodies in the frequency range 5 Hz to 13 MHz. These ac electrical data were found to exhibit relaxation in more than one complex plane formalisms in a simultaneous manner. The magnitude of the terminal capacitance was found to be in a narrow window of 3 pF to 6 pF possessing very weak temperature dependence. Further analysis also revealed that this material system possessed low dielectric constant and ultra-low temperature coefficient of",
