Also described are methods of treating microvascular complications of diabetes by decreasing expression and/or activity of SHP-1. 20100160412 06-03-2010 METHODS OF MODULATING ANGIOGENESIS - The present inventors discovered that PKC\u03b5 is necessary for VEGF signaling through PI3K/Akt-dependent pathways and is involved in MAPK-dependent pathways, thus regulating eNOS activity and DNA synthesis, respectively. Thus differential manipulation of PKC\u03b5 activity can be used to modify VEGF effects in conditions in which modulation of angiogenesis is desirable (e.g., for treatment of diabetic proliferative retinopathy or to enhance angiogenesis for treatment of peripheral and myocardial ischemia). 20100135995 Published Description Patent application number George Liang King, Dover, MA US 07-03-2014 PREDICTING AND TREATING DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS - Compositions and methods for diagnosing, predicting risk of, and/or treating diabetic retinopathy and/or diabetic nephropathy. 20140187498 Published Description Patent application number George L.
