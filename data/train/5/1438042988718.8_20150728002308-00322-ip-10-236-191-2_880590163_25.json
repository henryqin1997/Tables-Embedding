            "This school is great for those who have the ambition to learn and succeed in life, as well as have fun and enjoy themselves. Its a good school for those who like networking with people, and it's also a great school for those who like to party!",
            "If you are considering coming to Indiana State, here's a few tips I think you may find very useful. During the process of choosing your meal plan, I would advise you choose the Blue Plan. It comes with over 1300 credits and almost $300 in Commons Cash. I highly recommend this plan because it provides you with this amount every semester and you have less of a chance of being broke when the end of the semester approaches. Also, try to avoid getting into fights. Although sometimes it hurts to walk away from a fight, you must realize that your future is at stake. Also, try attending some of the campus activities. If you attend them, there's a good chance you'll be coming out of it with a new shirt, a new water bottle, or some very unique gadget!",
            "I would say that Indiana State University is among the top most affordable schools to get into in the State! For being schooled in Indiana and pursuing college in-state, students get a hefty discount which is mighty convenient to those whose parents are helping pay for their child's college expenses. After being here for a year already and comparing my experience with the discounted amount I paid, I would say that Indiana State is definitely a Bang for the buck school.",
            "Indiana State is jam-packed with activities and points of interest. We have recently been provided with a Recreation Center which is equipped with an indoor swimming pool and jacuzzi, an indoor track, a 6 basket Basketball Court, a weight room, and an indoor soccer/street hockey cage. I do not believe I could sum up all of the fun I've had in the Recreation Center because every time I go, I have a blast! Also, one of the best parts about campus is the Commons. In it, you can purchase food from well-known restaurants such as Burger King, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell. We also have a KFC Express on campus which a bulk load of students prefer. As well as there's food and physical activities, there's parties and fun! I, personally, have fun everyday at Indiana State due to its fine atmosphere, networking with different people, and making new friends daily! I enjoy myself to the maximum here at Indiana State!",
            "As a student at Indiana State, I would highly recommend my school to all those who enjoy learning new things and have an undying ambition to obtain success in the world today. Indiana State is equipped with great professors that put forth great effort to help our students succeed. With more than 100's of classes to choose from, there's no limit to what knowledge you can obtain. So far, I have taken classes from over 7 different fields of study and I'm just now entering into my sophomore year! I've learned more in one year of college than I have in both my Junior and Senior years in High School combined! Very impressive I must say!"

In town, there are sporting events, concerts, and festivals. Some events are free and are in walking distance from campus. Just a few miles north of Terre Haute is the home of the 4th largest festival in the United States -- the Parke County Covered Bridge Festival every October, although festival dates may be in conflict with Homecoming festivities., 172847=we march through the fountain., 244725=We currently do not have all black sororities on campus.

Currently it is an all black organization, but we are trying to expand it for all female on ISU campus, for the FALL 2012. We do many different activities like community service, pool parties, STD's/Safe Sex meetings and etc., 495718=We have a beautiful fountain located in the center of campus.

The city is large enough to give you a lot of options for entertainment and small enough to make you feel comfortable. Tips for prospective students Meet your roommate before you move in. It is easier to change before you move in than after. Make sure of your career objective if your not sure take a general education and take 1 class a semester of something that you may want to study. You may discover something your naturally good at and a new career. Bang for the buck Since the fees are the same for 12credit hours up to 18 credit hours you can set your course load to your ability not to your pocket book. The room",
