And I was going to sign up for summer courses, but they got canceled because I couldn't pull $1300 out of thin air for just two classes. While I understand that it's cheaper than most schools, it's still too much for me at times. And I hear tuition will be raised to pay for the $115,000 the school recently spent renovating the campus bookstore., 333652=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Make sure you join at least some extracurricular activity while at Purdue Calumet University, like Student Government or the school paper, for this looks really good on your resume when applying for jobs, especially on campus. PUC now has a co - curricular transcript, so this is an extra incentive to join student organizations at PUC.

Tips for prospective students Try to get involved with the on campus activities. They're really nice and you get to meet the other students, and sometimes faculty. I would also suggest joining a club or organization. Bang for the buck",
