The assembling structure includes a first member including a first resin molded article at least a first surface of which is coated by a coating film; and a second member including a second resin molded article at least a second surface of which is plated by a plating film. The first member and the second member are assembled so as to frictionally contact at the coating of the first surface and the plating film of the second surface; and the coating film includes a particle made from a fluorine resin. The generation of squeak noise can be suppressed with maintaining the physical properties of the coating film, such as gloss and re-coating ability. 20100015434 Published Description Patent application number Shigeyoshi Setsuda, Aichi-Ken JP 07-25-2013 ROTATING ELECTRICAL MACHINE - In a rotating electrical machine of axial-gap type in which a stator and a rotor are opposed to each other in arrangement and winding axis is parallel with a rotating shaft direction, the stator has an \u201cm\u201d protruding in the rotating shaft direction are distributed along a circumferential direction thereof, in which the winding pole is formed of a magnetic member having a plurality of teeth in a circular-arc shape in a diameter",
