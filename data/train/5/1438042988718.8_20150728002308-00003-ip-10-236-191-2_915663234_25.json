            "Fantastic, night owls keeps you safe at night if you don't want to walk around in the park, and the campus police always take care of any possible trouble.",
            "Many frats and soroities, I have many friends involved in Greek life and they absolutely love it!",
            "Lots of clubs, many fraternities, there's always something at FAU for the seeker.",
            "FAU is the closest university to the beach on the east coast.",
            "If you work hard you will definitely get your bang for the buck.",
            "The beach, nearby nightlife, amusement parks within an hour, on-campus activities.",
            "The on-campus food is solid (Quiznos, Wendeys etc.) but the city of Boca Raton has some fantastic restaurants nearby.",
            "Beautiful dorms, especially the new one's that were just built next to the brand new stadium. Also the beach is only a few miles away so there are so very fun places to go around the campus.",
            "Depending on your major the coursework can be pretty tough. From my experience, the college of science, specifically chemistry is one of the top departments in Florida. Also the the college of business is a top college and well known.",
            "Apply early! The school is growing like crazy and you definitely want to get your application in on time to have the best shot at being accepted. I would also recommend to get involved on campus because not many universities are in a processes of becoming more and really establishing itself on a national stage.",
            "Florida Atlantic University is a fantastic school. Florida Atlantic University has a beautiful, growing campus in sunny Boca Raton. Florida Atlantic University has excellent professors that are more than happy to help students in all aspects of their academic careers."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{240567=If the church bells ring, it's 12:08., 20646=FAU itself is very reasonable. If you live off campus (which I recommend after freshmore year), do so. FAU does not charge a million different fees. The parking permits are free, but don't dare park illegally. They're too quick. Boca Raton is an expensive city - gas is expensive here (comparably), clothes and jewelry and all of that glitz is expensive. The best bang for the buck are these hole in the wall food places that immigrants own - they're the best. I don't know anyone that goes to a chain restaurant. There's a local sushi place that gets FLOODED with FAU students on Friday and Saturday nights. Car insurance is cheap in this city for some reason. Rent is a little ridiculous. I come from tampa, and I could get a beautiful remodeled apartment for $750. $750 in Boca Raton is the hood. I mean not a nice area at all. Your average 1 bedroom in a nice area can run from $850 to over $1000. Get a roommate., 746916=The campus is extremely safe, we have a police station both on campus, and literally across the street. There are lights, and emergency phones peppered throughout the campus to prevent and reassure people who may be going that extra mile with the class going past 9:00, or coming back from the library, gym, etc. The students are incredibly considerate of one another's belongings and I can personally say I have never witnessed a theft, despite dropping my wallet on the ground, leaving my car unlocked, leaving my room unlocked and all the risky behaviours advised against., 183478=The dorm and meal plan requirement caused a major financial strain for me. The monthly cost ended up at around $1300 per month, which could theoretically pay for a luxury apartment or even a mortgage on a house. The school does offer scholarships to everyone who qualifies for and attends the Honors program so that helps. You can sign up for a payment plan if you can't pay a lump sum for tuition and fees., 1082147=A myriad of food choices (including starbucks and einstein bagels!) on campus but make sure you eat at a decent hour. If you have night classes (from 4:30 and on) the food stores will be closed. If they do close, there's a lot to eat within a 1-2 mile radius including, but not limited to, jamba juice, moe's, cheesecake factory, and another starbucks!, 970976=Good dorms. They just built new dorms opening in fall 2013, 338032=There has never been a time where I feel unsafe on campus, even when I am walking across campus at 11:30 PM after work. For those who do not want to walk because they feel unsafe, we have NightOwls, a free golfcart service that runs all over campus on weeknights until 11:30 PM. There are also the yellow poles placed everywhere on campus that have emergency buttons that contact the police. They will send a unit out to your exact location., 445540=I am here on scholarship, and there are still many facilities at the college that I do not use. If you do explore and take part in what the college has to offer, you may find it a good bang for your buck. Tuition goes up a lot every semester, and the addition of the new stadium for our loosing football team does not make it any better, let alone all these funding cuts of 2012. Classes are being taken off and availability is less. Teachers in certain programs are being let go, and only the difficult(personality, not by material) ones seem to be left. I think there should be improvement in the library... it looks old. There are many places to study, one must simply find there nook which they deem comfortable., 1015414=If you are planning to apply or attend FAU, I suggest that you prepare ahead of time and don't miss any deadlines! For example there are scholarships that the school offers. The award of some of these scholarships is determined at the time your application is review. However, there are other scholarships that the school offers that you must apply for individually. Most of the deadlines for these scholarships is in the beginning of January , therefore apply early! In addition make sure you make yourself familiar with people and numbers that are the most helpful to you. For example, freshman advisers and financial aid office employees are the most important to familiarize yourself with. It will come in handy., 281597=i find the classes i am taking and have taken at fau to be challenging, depending on the subject of course. i am presently taking a spanish intermediate class and i have been learning quite a bit about latin american countries as well as very useful grammar., 389729=On campus, there's a great variety of dining places to choose from. There's the cafeteria, which includes a buffet, Coyote Jacks, Papa Johns, Chick-n-Grill, Dunkin Doughnuts, Einsteins's Bagels, Starbucks, Wendy's, and so much more. During the 2012 fall year FAU is adding Subway to the list., 6974=FAU is the perfect mix of learning and fun. We all have to be responsible for getting ourselves to class and absorb and retain the days lessons. When the classes are done, however, the fun begins. Dorm life is awesome and there\u2019s plenty to do around here. The students are friendly and fun-loving. We all take care of each other and are a close-knit community. The professors seem to enjoy their work and are very helpful. The gym is free and open until late so even those of us who work can get our workouts in. The cafeteria services are great; the food is fresh and it\u2019s open until about 10:30 pm for dinner, which means we can still get real food instead of cold, pre-packaged sandwiches or snacks from our dorms. We have our own little town on campus with many conveniences--yes, even a fast-food court for those who miss being back home. When we went to get out, though, the big city is just a street light away with hordes of activities and amenities, including some of the most beautiful beaches., 938142=Plenty of scholarships, they gave me 1000 dollars for summer classes just because I answered some questions early. Not too expensive, and good quality., 1014530=At FAU, first time students are required to attend an orientation session that covers the length of two days. All sessions are require you to sleep overnight at the institution, except for the Early Owls orientation. When I went, we slept in Heritage Park Towers it is nice and quaint although it does not have an open common area like Indian River Towers and the new Parliament Hall opening up in Fall 2013. I myself will be staying in HPT (acronym that you will hear very often) and I find it to be reasonable for my needs. Everyone is different and can choose whatever type of housing style they may want, just make sure to choose a living style that will make you the most comfortable.}",
