            "Its worth suffering through. Each credit hour is so cheap and your saving thousands of dollars every semester compared to a university.",
            "They always have random events going on and when its nice out people sit out on the grass all over campus. Also there are sporting events and clubs.",

            "Just think about how much money you are saving each year and you can still get a associates degree there which can do very well for your future.",
            "To be honest it sucks. Most people are antisocial or just to quiet and to lazy to talk to people. Just about everyone except me smokes cigarettes. Most teachers are very well educated and know what they are talking about but every semester you always get one teacher who doesn't really care about you and your goals or you get a psycho who will take points off for not stapling a paper. I'm reading to move on to another school. Last the counslers suck."
