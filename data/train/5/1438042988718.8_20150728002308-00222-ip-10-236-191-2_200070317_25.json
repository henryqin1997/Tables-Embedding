Rainy season starts from July to September. About 80% of the total rainfall is received during this period. Some amount of rainfall is received from western disturbances during winter season. Due to less rainfall and its short duration the agricultural activities is mostly dependent upon canal irrigation and Tubewells., 85064=1994, 807=Ever since the beginning of the history man has struggled against the elemental forces of nature to establish his mastery over the environment. Although, science and technology have made tremendous strides in the present century, the struggle has not ceased. Many regions of the country are vulnerable to natural disasters and are becoming increasingly vulnerable. The past decade has witnessed an extra ordinary increase in the number and extent of natural disasters. The cost of weather related disaster in 1998 exceeded the cost of all such disaster in the decade of 1980\u0092s. There were three times as many great natural hazards in the 1990\u0092s as in the 1960\u0092s while the disaster costs increased more than nine fold in the same period., 146838=- M.R.F. Ltd. Chennai. 8292774, 27928=Density of population indicates towards the intensity of population on infrastructure and other resources of the region. It also helps to estimate the severity of a calamity if it takes place in a densely populated area. Thus, analysis of density of population has become much important. As per the density data, district ranked 6 in 1991, which went down to 8th rank as per 2001 census. Present density of Rohtak district is 539 persons / sq. km., which is much higher than the national average and state average, 83144=Water is one of the basic requirements of mankind for domestic and agriculture purposes. The water table, nearly 115 year before was in between 30 to 70 meters. The canals were introduced for the purpose of agricultural development and from here onwards the water table started rising and creating alarming conditions in certain pockets in district. The waterlogging problem has become serious from last few years and by 1998 the total water logged area in the district has reached upto 62%. This problem is critical along canals and at some places the water table has been exposed to the surface causing damage to land and crops.

The department will also evaluated and update the resource data base for meeting the requirement of manpower, equipment and material for performing the functions assigned to the agency in District Emergency Management Plan in May every year., 49318=The table given above is based upon the old Rohtak comprising of the present Rohtak and Jhajjar districts. The above table shows the severity of floods in the district. Nearly 7 lakh people were effected by these floods. The number of villages which were effected by the floods were 343 (map no 3.1). Around 214809 hectares of land was effected. 39 people were died because of the floods. The total economic loss was of the tune of Rs.2000/- Crores., 37422=GROWTH OF URBANISATION (1981-2001), 21968=Rohtak district is a part of Inland drainage basin. The topography of the district is saucer type, therefore, rain water creates flood problems in monsoon season. In order to avoid flood, drains have been dug out. The main source of draining floodwater is drain no. 8, which is contributing a lot of ground water recharge. It enters the district in village Sanghi. It flows along the western side of the district headquarter and leaves the district and enters Jhajjar district near Beri. This drain safeguards the district from floods. Two new drains have been dug after 1995 floods to drain off the water of Meham, Lakhan Majra & Kalanaur area into drain no. 8. These are Meham drain which is 42 Kms. and passes through Kalanaur & Meham blocks covering 33 villages. Second is Lakhan Majra drain, which is 33 Km. Long, covers 23 villages of Meham and Lakhan Majra blocks. These two enters in drain no. 8 at village Kalanaur ultimately going to the river Yamuna., 30801=Literacy plays a key role to improve the skills of human capital of the region. if an area has high literacy rate than it will be much easier to make them to understand the importance the preplanning of disaster and will help to create awareness rapidly. High literacy rate also insures high level of community participation. As per year 2001, the district shows literacy rate of 74.56%, which is quiet high than national average and state average., 83909=Over 98% of the total areas of the district lie within 10 meters depth of under ground water. The area under water logging is increasing very rapidly. In the year 1994 only 11.1% and 34.1% area was water logged before and after monsoons respectively. (See Map 3.2 and 3.3) But in the year 1998 these respective figures has increased upto 41.6% and 61.8% in the same time periods. 1995 floods enhance the problem of water logging. Following table shows the trend of water logging since 1994 to 1998 in June & October., 91566=(2000-4000)*, 233763=The department will ensure that all the medical doctors are aware about the responsibilities of the department in case of a disaster and all the manpower of the department, including para medical staff, are sensitized regarding the need for maximum efficiency during disaster situation. This should be achieved by organizing orientation training for the staff in the month of May every year., 281176=The department should take immediate measures for the retrofitting of all Government buildings under its charge for making them seismic resistant. The department should ensure that all officers of the rank of Sub Engineers or above are made familiar about the responsibilities of the department in District Emergency Management Plan and the resources that may be required for discharging his responsibility in case of a disaster. This should be achieved by organizing orientation training to all such officers in the month of May every year., 149770=5. DRO office in Mini Secretriate - 41401., 67771=The floods can be anticipated, so stress is to be laid for the preventive measures as per saying \"prevention is better than cure\". So far as Rohtak district is concerned, worse affected has been the Rohtak town itself, because its location is Bowl type i.e., flood watrer has to be dewatered by providing three no. lifts form the jeart of the city. The responsibility to cleat the water rests with the Public Health Department and to make the system more efficient, the various steps such as round the clock electric supply to the pumps by providing alternative feeders, installation of stand by pumps. On the part of Irrigation, the protection of First line and second line ring bund which starts from Rohtak Gohana Railway line up to the Drain No. 8 and then from Hisar Road to Bhiwani Road and further up to Sunaria Road should be well maintained, because as per past history of floods of 1960, the Rohtak town had been victim of Drain No. 8. Though, the drain No. 8 has been rehabilitated and its capacity has been considerably increased by deepening and widening, but regular maintenance particularly clearance of jungle which generally grown is the bed of the drain also as this was the main factor which led to the inundation of Rohtak town by over flowing of drain No.8. Similarly, the worse affected area was during1995, Meham and Sampla due to non maintenance of drains in the area because there was heavy wild growth of patera, kabli kikkar etc. in the bed of pakasma drain due to which there was flooding in Sampla town without heavy rains in the catchment. Similarly, due to non-functioning of link drains in Gohana sub-division i.e., Isapur Kheri link drain, Bhambewa drain and Chhapra drain which outall into the drain No. 8 could not function properly and due to over flow at various points there was unwanted sheet flow in Meham area and worse affected villages were Madina, Mokhra, Behalba, and Nindana. To counteract the floods in the said area, Meham drain, Lakjanmajra drain have been constructed with link drains which untimately outfall into drain No. 8. The proper maintenance of these drains will definitely prevent the floods in the area. In additions to above, the various preventive measures are discussed as under:, 84497=WATER LOGGED AREA (1994-98), 149477=1. -Deputy commissioner's office - 42222., 81044=The problem of floods is further accentuated by the existence of man-made barriers like the networks of roads and canals, which obstruct the natural flow of water. Notable among these obstructions are the Jawahar Lal Nehru canal and Jhajjar sub branch as well as the State highways passing through the district. Major damage to crops is caused due to flooding of such depressions in the district. 1995 floodwater were trapped in the Meham and Kalanaur area by the B.S.B leading to water accumulation. The reason for flood in Rohtak City was that the railway line (Rohtak-Panipat) was uprooted and the water infiltrated in the city. In the same way village Mokhra and adjoining villages got flooded because of N. H. 10 was disconnected which was obstructing the natural flow of water. These instances show that the transportation network here is faulty and is an obstruction in the natural drainage (General Observations), 96181=Tehsil wise details of water quality from 1994 onwards for the periods of before and after are given in Annexe no. 1-10. These tables show that the rainfall has an impact on the ground water quality. The total area under the saline water DDCReases after monsoon period because fresh water is increased & improves the quality of ground water. The same trend can be seen in case of fresh water. The amount of fresh water increases from June to October. Once the rainwater adds up in the ground water; it improves the quality of ground water. The impact of floods can also be seen on the quality of ground water. The ground water Quality has improved after the 1995 floods. But after one year area under saline water has been started increasing again. If Tehsils area categorised on the bases of saline water in June 1998, maximum area under saline water was Rohtak (10.2%) followed by Meham (5.9%)., 43243=During disasters it is not only the human beings but also the livestock who are effected. The 1995 floods of Haryana, 1998 supercyclone and 2001 earthquake of Gujarat are the liveliest examples. In all these situations the animals were very badly effected., 46454=LOSSES DUE TO FLOODS, 1995, 172077=In addition to above, the District flood Control Room will be set up in the office of the Deputy Commissioner, Rohtak and each Tehsil Head Quarter w.e.f. 1.7.2001. The district revenue officer will be officer in charge of the district flood control room., 211892=Being a key response organization in the district, it is vital that this organization remains in a state of preparedness to ensure its general readiness to respond to a disaster situation. The District Commandant, Homeguard will ensure the execution of following action and send compliance to the District Collector in the first week of June every year, in the format mentioned in Checklist 5., 27436=2001, 88650=The water table in the district Rohtak is rising at the rate of 0.02 meters/annum. It is clear from the table that highest area under water logging is in Rohtak which was only 30.1 % in June and Reached upto 95.6% after the floods., 343220=In view of increase in seismic activities and moderate risk of flash flood during the rainy season, DDCR should start functioning from 1 st July to 31 st October. Assessment of preparedness action should also be done, during the first week of July. A meeting of the District Crisis Group members should be held to assess the preparedness action taken on part of different response agencies. The District Collector would ensure that the concerned response agencies validate and update their resource inventory in June every year. The concerned response agencies will be required to submit their preparedness status report in the format mentioned in their SOPs, placed at Annexure. On completion of assessment, the District Collector would send a preparedness report to the State Relief Commissioner in the month of July every year., 149875=7.

During 1995, there was sheet flow between drain No.8 and JLN Feeder which ultimately entered in Rohtak town particularly. To counteract the same, Rohtak drain has been constructed which outfalls into Kultana-Chhudani-Dhupania drain. The latter has also been rehabilitated which outfalls into Najafgarh drain and ultimately the water is discharged kin river Yamuna.

He will ensure that the concerned departments validate and update the resource inventory in June every year and will send a preparedness report to the Relief Commissioner in July every year., 300899=The department should ensure that all officers of the rank of Sub Engineers or above are made familiar about the responsibilities of the department in District Emergency Management Plan and the resources that may be required for discharging his responsibility in case of a disaster. This should be achieved by organizing orientation training to all such officers in the month of May every year., 310402=The department should identify the equipment and the material that may require for discharging the responsibilities assigned to it in case of disaster. It should also workout the availability of the same with the department and identify the external resources for the same and work out arrangement for procuring the same in case of disaster. The department should do a stock verification of the equipment and material available with it, require for its responsibility under the plan in May every year. It should validate and update the resource database also in May every year. It will also identify the source in the community and the local market from which additional resource may be obtained for performing the responsibilities of the department with the assistance of the District Crisis Group and work out the arrangements for procuring the same., 141907=Thus a total of 148 cs. capacity has been installed by public Health department for Rohtak Town. With urbanization of the town, the pondage area has also been depleted and the entire quantity of storm water has to be pumped out. The maximum accumulation of storm water takes place in Chhotu Ram Park area. It has a catchment area of 1200 acres and only 60 cusecs of pumping has been installed. Thus is case of 4\" of rainfall in a day 300 acre feet of water would be collected and it would take 2 and \ufffd day to clear the water., 146039=2. E.C. bags. - S.D.M. Rohtak 41068, 45552=Some of the major floods in the district are of 1960,1980,1987 and 1995. Of which the most devastating flood was during August and September 1995. This flood was termed as one of the severe in last 60 years when about 55% of the total area was submerged resulting in huge economic loss conservatively estimated as Rs. 2000/- Crores. These unprecedented floods largely shattered the economy of Rohtak district. 83.2% of the total villages were flood effected. Out of which 33.9% villages were badly flood effected and 49.3% villages were moderately flood effected. In Meham and Rohtak 87% and 62% villages were badly flood effected., 5016=Present study i.e. Rohtak district too, is not an exception in the case. It has already experienced the floods of 1995, as well as fire hydrants time to time. Along with, it comes under the earthquake zone IV that is the second most vulnerable area for earthquakes in the country. Thus, it is clear that the study area too not free from natural disasters and can be involved by any one at any time. Therefore, it required a pre-planned strategy that will be efficient to reduce the damage and can recover the area rapidly., 89593=<2000, 94330=Marginal Fresh (2000-4000)*, 47702=Rs. 2000/ Crores, 198364=Being a key response organization in the district, it is vital that this organization remains in a state of preparedness to ensure its general readiness to respond to a disaster situation.

It should validate and update the resource database also in May every year. It will also identify the source in the community and the local market from which additional resource may be obtained for performing the responsibilities of the department with the assistance of the District Crisis Group and work out the arrangements for procuring the same. The Executive Engineer should ensure compliance of all the points mentioned above and send a compliance report to the District Collector in general every year as per the checklist mentioned as Checklist no 23, 25625=District stands at thirteenth place in terms of population and ________ in terms of area amongst the districts of Haryana. As per 2001 census, the total population of the district is 940036 persons. The population has increased about______ times in last 40 years. The growth rate was 22.6% per annum between 1951-61 which went up to 20.99 per annum in 1991-2001, which is much less than the state average growth rate i.e. 28.06 per annum., 29029=2001, 193555=A meeting of the district Crisis Group held in first week of July to review the preparedness for floods and earthquakes., 132826=As mentioned above, the district faced floods many time due to its topography and it took months to clear the floodwaters. The city is surrounded by Drain no.8 and JLN Feeder, which is one of the main canal of the State. Introspection of flood waters reveals that flood water has entered in Rohtak Town either from Drain no.8 or by crossing/ overtoppling the then low lying bund on the northern side connecting Gohana-Rohtak Railway line to Drain no.8 during 1995, due to choking of Diversion Drain no.8, the inlets on the right side started functioning due to rise in water level in Diversion Drain no.8 and then as per topography water started flowing was taken by Drain bo.8, but due to rise in water level in Drain no.8 there was a back flow and ultimately the sheet water touched the existing northern bund. Due to heavy rains in the first week of September, 1995. the flood waters ultimately overtopped the bund and water entered into the city area. Due to this natural inundation, there was approximately 10' water in depth in the heart of the city and town itself had to be vacated. Similar situation occurred due to breach in Drain no.8 during 1962. To clear the floodwaters, it took complete one month after putting all the resources available at the command of Rohtak district. Similarly, there was heavy flooding in the rural area particularly in Meham Sub Division, where it took approximately one year to clear the floodwaters. Like this, there was heavy damages caused by the floods in Rural as well as Urban areas. In nutshell, Rohtak town/Rohtak district itself is one the critical district so far as floods are concerned. To counteract these floods, various preventive measures have been taken which are discussed below :-, 189012=2.1 The District Collector will ensure that he receives the preparedness reports from all the concerned Government departments in June every year and will convene a meeting of the district Crisis Group in the first week of July every year to review the preparedness for floods and earthquakes., 74888=Harijan Basti -14 \", 46258=3.3 ECONOMIC LOSS DUE TO 1995 FLOOD, 145754=1.

The winter season starts towards the later half of November and extends till about the middle of March followed by summer, which continues till about the end of June when maximum temperature reaches up to 45\ufffd C and dust cyclones are common. After it, Southwest monsoon arrives. The rainy season remains between July to September. The post monsoon months October and November constitute a transitional period from monsoon to winter season., 85222=1996, 136090=To make the district flood free, the rehabilitation of the existing drains has been under WRCP while most of the drains have been constructed under NABARAD project. During 1995, there was a sheet flow between drain no.8 and JLN Feeder, which ultimately entered in Rohtak town particularly. To counteract the same, Rohtak drain has been constructed which outfalls into Kultana-chhudani-Bhupania drain. The latter has also been rehabilitated which outfalls into Najafgarh drain and ultimately the water is discharged in River Yamuna. The list of the existing drain in Rohtak district is attached., 319535=The extension staff of the department should be made aware of the possibilities of such short duration crops and seeds and the management practices for the same. A checklist Checklist no 19 is given which will be filled in the month of May by the head and submit to DDCR., 14968=Sampla block is situated on the southeastern part of the district.

(See Map No. 3.4) The fresh water is available in pockets, mainly along the canals and drains and near the water bodies. Fresh water is available at shallower depths whereas the quality deteriorates along with depth., 291389=The department should ensure that all officers of the rank of Sub Engineers or above are made familiar about the responsibilities of the department in District Emergency Management Plan and the resources that may be required for discharging his responsibility in case of a disaster. This should be achieved by organizing orientation training to all such officers in the month of May every year. The department should identify the equipment and the material that may require for discharging the responsibilities assigned to it in case of disaster. It should also workout the availability of the same with the department and identify the external resources for the same and work out arrangement for procuring the same in case of disaster. The department should do a stock verification of the equipment and material available with it, require for its responsibility under the plan in May every year. It should validate and update the resource database also in May every year. It will also identify the source in the community and the local market from which additional resource may be obtained for performing the responsibilities of the department with the assistance of the District Crisis Group and work out the arrangements for procuring the same., 9402=Rohtak district is located in southeastern part of Haryana State and constitutes a major part of eastern Haryana plain. With an area of 1668 sq. km it lies between -------- to 29\ufffd 18' north latitude and 75\ufffd 13' to ---------- east longitude. Rohtak District, a part of eastern Haryana plain is bordered by Sonepat in north east and Jind districts in the north, Jhajjar District in the South, Hissar district in the north west and Bhiwani in the West. The district headquarter is one of the eight identified priority towns in National Capital Region. Thus the location plays a vital role for the development of the district. Due to proximity to National capital, the developmental activities are taking place very rapidly. The district has witnessed rapid industrialisation, urbanisation, diversification in agriculture, change in occupation structure. The district is situated on the National Highway No. 10 leading from Delhi to Hissar., 141656=Harihjan Basti - 14 Cs., 229365=Orientation training was organized this year for the purpose in the month of April, 60321=Social vulnerability mainly depends on factors like population density, age, gender and social caste. According to 1991 census, total population in Rohtak was 776966 and population for the year 2001 is 940036. It is seen from map that position and settlement on loose soil make the population of this tehsil more vulnerable to damage due to soil liquefaction, which may follow an earthquake. As the population along this belt is above one lakh , a large number of people are at risk. The district female population is 692779 and it is 48.5 % of total population. The sex ratio in Rohtak is 847 women per 1000 men. The age group also plays a major role in identifying vulnerable groups. The census report shows that age groups of 0 \u0096 14, 15 \u009619, 50 \u009659 and more than 60 are more vulnerable than other age groups. Male genders are more vulnerable in 0 \u009614, 50 \u009659 and more than 60 age groups. Social caste is also important for identifying the vulnerability of a particular community., 13542=Source: census of India, 1991, 147065=- Advance Engineering works. 5722150, 344083=The District Collector will appoint a senior administrative officer as an officer-in-charge of DDCR.

The soil of Rohtak town has a very low load bearing capacity and hence does not have high rise or multi-storeyed buildings. The maximum height allowed both by the Municipal Committee and HUDA is 36 feet or three storeyed buildings. However, since it is an old township there may be several houses, buildings and structures which are about a hundred years old. Immediate steps need be taken to get them vacated and then demolished at an early stage. It is very important to remember that Rohtak district is a very flood prone district and Rohtak town has been badly affected by flood waters several times, the worst being those of 1962, 1983 and 1995 when the town continued to be inundated for several days and in some low lying areas for several weeks. These stagnant waters must have definitely affected the foundation and structure of both old and new houses., 194157=The concerned departments validated and updated the resource inventory in June this year and sent a preparedness report to the Relief Commissioner, 41375=2000-4999, 321077=(Checklist to be filled in the month of May by the head.), 79920=The total amount of average rainfall in the district is about 50 Cm annually. But during September 3 to 5, 1995 more than 90-cm rainfall occurred on these three days. Such a heavy down pour resulted in devastating floods in the district.

The location of Rohtak Town and levels does not allow the gravity flow of the rain water into the nearby drains, but dewatering is being done through pumping and for that considering particular rainfall, the capacity of the pumps has been designed. In case there is heavy rainfall, then there is a flooding in most of the town area and that is why it has necessitated the Flood Disaster Management plan for Rohtak Town as well as surrounding areas, because district has face critical floods during 1960, 1962, 1967, 1977, 1983, 1987 and 1995., 81991=Excessive discharge in drain no. 8 can cause breach in the drain endangering not only rural area but also Rohtak town, as it happened during the floods in the year 1960, 1980 and recently in 1995.
