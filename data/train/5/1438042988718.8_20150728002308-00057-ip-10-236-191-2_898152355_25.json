    "textAfterTable": "Comments Great for these types of students All majors Tips for prospective students Park in the yellow lines only; they love giving tickets. Come early, but not too early before... nevermind just walk because you will never get a parking spot. Did enjoy being here I wouldn't say I enjoyed being there. The parking was horrendous and the City Park location was the worst. I still have a bad taste from my freshman year. The staff gave me the run around. Delgado, in my opinion was just okay. Did learn a lot I attended both Westbank and City Park locations. Some of the teachers are really great, some should never teach. The classes are NOT that easy. You will study and study hard to pass most classes.
