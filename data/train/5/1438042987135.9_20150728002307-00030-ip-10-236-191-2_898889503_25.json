            "Lots of awareness on campus and a ton of accountability. However, this leads to a heightened awareness of the nature of our culture of rape, so you can't ignore how bad things are on average. This is not a negative. There is a campus security force but due to the nature of a security apparatus it is hard to trust them with much.",
            "Nope.",
            "You can make up whatever you want or you can join a club. If you like to dance, it is pretty great, we got a dance collective.",
            "Self motivated individuals. The people who don't really fit at other schools. The individuals who are working towards establishing their sense of identity among equals. Those who don't like being reduced to a grade or a number.",
            "There is a massive forest behind the campus and a beach front.",
            "Very good value for the cost. Evergreen is very cheap for a state school.",
            "Dance, go to the woods or the beach, go to a show, hang out with friends, or go for a bike ride. It's a very active place for active people.",
            "Great student run cafe, main food service is awful.",
            "Never lived there, heard it was OK.",
            "Very rigorous but not obscenely difficult. The rigor depends on you.",
            "Make sure you know that you want to go here, this school is not for everyone. It is great for people who are willing to take chances as well as people who are willing to find out new things.",
            "It is a fantastic liberal arts college. It has great options for self motivated individuals. It is a great place for finding out what you want to do in life."
