It truly is a close community that is vastly different than any large state university. When you meet someone new, you don't have to worry about never seeing them again. People are so friendly, it's really refreshing! Also, the weather is magnificent because Spokane has four wonderfully distinct seasons, only 17 inches of annual rainfall, and 260 clear days of sunshine. Another bonus is that the dining hall is expanding and will be brand new in fall 2012, three dorms have been built in the past 10 years, and a new dorm will be construted soon. I live in the newest dorm and it is like a hotel that is nicer than my room at home! Heck, I even get to take skiing/snowboarding for a PE credit! The brand new science building is also INCREDIBLE., 152976=Just stay away from the men's dorm after 11:45 pm on most nights and Shirts off o'clock is every night at 11 in Stewart. Also, go to the village because they will tell you that the Village is a horrible place but only the few who venture inside will ever truly have fun at Whitworth!, 247741=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 129961=Buffet Style! Oh, and they just remodeled, so it'll be bigger this up-coming year (2012-13), with some more options and seating arrangements. Not like state schools, but Whitworth does prefer to offer healthy choices that are absolutely delicious! Outside of the cafeteria, there's also the Mind and Hearth Cafe, and the Coffee shop too!, 221344=1) When you go to Whitworth, don't just go to get a degree and certainly don't have the get in, get out mentality. Apathy will be the water on your fire for growth. Go to Whitworth ready to engage. Go ready to pour out all that you are and receive from those around you. You will not be disappointed by the great exchange that takes place. 2) In all things, seek to try your hardest and do your very best, but a word of caution with this, pick a few things to do and do them well. I have seen far too many people, including myself, spread themselves too thin by joining countless clubs, volunteering, working, and seeking meaningful relationships while maintaining a high GPA. In and of themselves, each of these is beautiful and wonderful. However, if you try to do it all, everything you do will be lacking. 3) Seek adventure while you are at Whitworth! There are so many opportunities to study abroad and explore new jobs and frontiers through groups and internships. Take every chance you can to go after the adventures that interest you. You can do this wisely again without spreading yourself too thin and one of the best ways to do so is to travel over Jan. Term (this is a school term we have just for the month of January). I went to Costa Rica one year and on a monastic retreat another year. These each changed my life!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Jenna from Grand Junction, CO 01/14/2010 Reviewer is A current student here. 8 out of 8 people found this review useful. 2 of 51 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Christian students who want to be challenged in their faith and in their education. Students who are open-minded and caring and who will enjoy a smaller university with countless opportunities to get involved in the Spokane community and receive an education of the mind and heart. Tips for prospective students Be excited and willing to meet new people and have a great time. Try to visit during the fall or late spring--it's beautiful during these times. Visit a class if possible, and talk to current students. They will tell you all about the programs offered at Whitworth, the caliber of students and faculty, the integration of faith and learning, the emphasis on the Christian community, and the warm atmosphere that permeates the university. Bang for the buck Whitworth is very expensive. Although they do offer scholarships, the cost to attend the university",
