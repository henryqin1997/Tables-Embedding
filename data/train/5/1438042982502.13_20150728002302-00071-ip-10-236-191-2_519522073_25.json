It is now considered that up to 15% may correspond to secondary forms [2-4]. In particularly, recent studies suggest, primary hyperaldosteronism (PA), first described by Conn in 1955, is a rather common condition accounting for more than 10% of all cases [2-4]. This contrasts sharply with previous consensus, where essential or \u201cidiopathic\u201d hypertension was assumed to account for about 95% of all cases of non selected HBP [5].\u00a0, 29865=ICMJE Recommendations (updated August 2013) Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, 29470=WMA Declaration of Helsinki Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects (October 2013)}",
