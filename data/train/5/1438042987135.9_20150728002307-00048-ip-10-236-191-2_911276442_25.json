Also, visit the campus! You will fall in love with the students and professors here at Grace as well as the beautiful campus., 49561=The food and dining at the college is, honestly, pretty good for the most part, and certainly well balanced. It's a buffet style and quality dining commons, so not only the students may eat there but anyone who desires to (who can pay, of course!). Called Alpha Dining, the buffet always has a salad bar, with some things being added such as a pasta mix. It also always has a dessert bar, a sandwich and cereal bar, and almost always has a grill for hamburgers, pizza, and certain other similar foods; and lastly a specialty bar that changes from day to day, meal to meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Students usually get a meal plan at the start of the semester (freshmen are required to get the highest meal plan, fifteen meal scans per week; but more upper class men and women have several options) but may choose not to. If students (or those from elsewhere) prefer an alternative, there's also a sub shop right on campus open until late at night (11:00 p.m.) that offers a pretty good selection, including a little bakery for cookies, brownies, and the like. Students may use their meal scans there or buy. Both facilities are quite clean, comfortable, and welcoming, both usually being rather full on a regular basis.}",

Tips for prospective students There should be no worries about whether or not you'll fit in here, because you will! It truly is a great place where everyone cares, from teachers and faculty to students. For example, when I first came, I was terrified of the upperclassmen. But it turns out that they are just as interested in watching you succeed as everyone else! There are plenty of things to do on campus and places to hang out. It's a wonderful campus with so much to offer!",
