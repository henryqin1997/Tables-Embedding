The Smaug on the other hand has, what I believe to be, great food. You do have to use dining dollars, purple pass, cash, or credit/debit cards for that though., 172627=The caf gets repetitive and bland after a while, but the school has a lot of options on campus, in an area we call the Smaug. Plenty of fast food and local restaurants will keep anybody happy., 235394=There are TONS of options provided in the cafeteria. Personally I prefer to eat in the smaug because I am obsessed with mondo's sub's., 200990=There is plenty of options on campus. I particularly enjoy the dining in the Smaug., 122101=The campus is beautiful and pristine; it is also super well kept which is nice. The dorms are also well kept, and seem to be newly furnished but are super hot in the late month of August. I have not had one professor that I have not liked; they are all really fair, but still hard enough to make you work for a good grade.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students If you are a hard working student who is passionate about what you want to do, this is the place for you to dive right in. Or if you still need to decide and explore your options, this is the perfect place for you! Tips for prospective students My best advice for prospective students would be to come in with some credits if possible. Not only does it put you ahead of other freshman, but it allows you to choose your classes before the other freshman, makes finishing in four years more likely if you choose to pursue a minor, and gets you used to taking college classes. As a freshman, make sure you step out of your comfort zone to meet people. Sure, it will be awkward, but that is the best way to meet friends you will have for the next four years! Lastly, explore the scholarships that the school offers. Winona offers many different scholarships for diverse subjects, so you should be able to find one for you. Just spend the time...it's worth it! Bang for the buck Winona offers many scholarships ranging from diversity to music to merit to major specified. It is one of the most reasonably priced MNSCU schools in the state and I",
