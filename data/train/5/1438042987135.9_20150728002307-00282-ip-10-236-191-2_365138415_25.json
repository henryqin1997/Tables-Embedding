Autoimmun.Rev. 2007;6(8):577-80., 29070=One third subsample of participants aged 12 years and older from NHANES 2001-2002 in the Dioxin subsample who had stored sera (total of N = ~5,000 from NHANES 1999-2004)., 30183=Title: Immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation analyses of autoantibodies (NHANES Surplus Sera) (SSANA_B ) Contact Number: 1-866-441-NCHS Years of Content: 2001 - 2002 First Published: June, 2011 Revised: February, 2012 Access Constraints: None Use Constraints: None Geographic Coverage: National Subject:Autoantibodies by Immunofluorescence Record Source: NHANES 2001 - 2002 Survey Methodology: NHANES 2001 - 2002 is a stratified multistage probability sample of the civilian non-institutionalized population of the U.S. Medium: NHANES Web site; SAS transport files, 26579=More than every 50th sample (2% of the total from NHANES 1999-2004) was automatically repeated to assess assay precision issues. Additional samples were repeated for the following reasons: 1) Titering of 3+/4+ positive samples (repeat, n=692) 2) Randomly selected samples for titering (and repeat, n=1035) 3) Other repeats are performed whenever there is any doubt for accuracy or technical issues. Samples repeated with 2 independent staining = 895; 3 independent staining = 194; 4 independent staining = 4., 23203=For the analysis of a single 2-year NHANES data release (for example the NHANES 1999-2000 ANA data) the 2-year Dioxin subsample weights WTSPO2YR should be used. If an analysis is performed combining the NHANES 1999-2000 and 2001\u20132002 ANA data into a single 4-year dataset, then the 4-year Dioxin subsample weights WTSPO4YR should be used for analysis. The NHANES 1999\u20132000 and 2001-2002 Dioxin data files (LAB28POC and LAB28POC_B, respectively) contain the WTSPO2YR WTSPO4YR subsample weight variables. To construct Dioxin subsample weights combining the three NHANES survey years 1999-2000, 2001-2001 and 2003-2004, please see the current NHANES Tutorial section \u201cConstructing Weights for Combined NHANES Survey Cycles\u201d., 23648=Special subsample sample weights are required to analyze the NHANES ANA data. This is because the ANA data was analyzed using stored serum samples obtained from survey participants who had been previously selected for the NHANES 1999-2004 Dioxin subsample. The Dioxin subsample is a randomly selected 1/3 subsample of each 2-year NHANES cycle, therefore the Dioxin subsample weights should be used for ANA data statistical analysis., 1553=Reeves WH, Satoh M, Lyons R, Nichols C, Narain S: Detection of autoantibodies against proteins and ribonucleoproteins by double immunodiffusion, immunoprecipitation, and western blotting.

Washington, D.C.: American Society of Microbiology Press; 2006: 1007-1018., 24432=The NHANES Questionnaire data files contain socio-economic data, health indicators, and other related information collected during household interviews. The Phlebotomy examination data file includes auxiliary information on duration of fasting, the time of day of the venipuncture, and the conditions precluding venipuncture. The demographic, questionnaire and phlebotomy examination files may be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant identifier SEQN. Autoantibody immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation (ANA) data was obtained for a total of three NHANES cycles (1999-2000; 2001-2002; & 2003-2004). The datasets were released as SSANA_A, SSANA_B, and SSANA_C., 29349=IgG autoantibody testing of a subsample stored serum of specimens from NHANES (2001\u20132002) was conducted to estimate the prevalence and specificities of selected autoantibodies in the US population in 2001\u20132002., 28470=The cellular pattern of staining and its staining intensity from 0 to 4+ was described using a reference gallery per below. The determination of autoantibody titers from 1:80 to 1:1280 was performed by serial dilution on samples that showed a 3+ or greater nuclear and/or cytoplasmic immunofluorescence pattern.}",
