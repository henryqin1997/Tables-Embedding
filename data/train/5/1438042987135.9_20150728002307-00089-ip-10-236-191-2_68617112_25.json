This table shows the price index values for the example. Example for adjusting balances based on a price index Using Inflation Adjustment Based on a Price Index In Argentina, companies report both historical balances and inflation-adjusted balances. You can maintain both balances by keeping your historical balances in one ledger and your inflation-adjusted balances in another ledger.

    "textAfterTable": "Note: If you enter an inflation adjustment date that is after the journal entry effective date, General Ledger does not use that inflation adjustment date. Instead, the inflation adjustment is calculated based on the journal entry effective date. To use the Inflation Adjustment Date feature, you must define the ledger where you will run the inflation adjustment process as an MRC primary ledger, even if you do not use the MRC feature in General Ledger. You can classify a ledger as primary in the Multiple Reporting Currencies tabbed region in the Ledger window. Use the Change Currency window to enter the inflation adjustment date. You can navigate to the Change Currency window by pressing the Change Currency button in the Journals window. Enter the inflation adjustment date in the To Date field. General Ledger only adjusts the lines with accounting flexfield combinations that fall within the account ranges you specified when you submitted the inflation adjustment process.
