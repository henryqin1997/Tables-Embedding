            "METHOD FOR PRODUCING CHLOROPOLYSILANE AND FLUIDIZED-BED REACTOR - Disclosed is a method for producing chloropolysilane by which the yield of a fluid reaction to produce the chloropolysilane is improved while blockage in a reactor caused by attachment of higher-order silicon chloride as a by-product is prevented. In producing the chloropolysilane by reacting fluidized silicon particles or silicon alloy particles with a chlorine gas, an outlet filter is provided, upstream from a product outlet that releases a reaction product, above the area in which the silicon particles or silicon alloy particles are fluidized inside a reaction tank. The outlet filter prevents fine particles blown up by fluidization from flowing out of the reaction tank through the product outlet. A temperature of the outlet filter is set in a range of 210 to 350\u00b0 C.",
            "MANUFACTURING METHOD OF HIGH-PURITY CHLOROPOLYSILANE - [Problem] Chloropolysilane having a low metallic impurity concentration has been required to be obtained in order to be used for semiconductor applications. However, it is difficult by distillation to remove impurities such as a titanium compound having a vapor pressure close to that of chloropolysilane and an aluminum compound having a sublimating property. Meanwhile, when the content of metallic impurities such as aluminum and titanium reduces in metallic silicon that is a raw material, chlorination reaction is less likely to occur unless a reaction temperature is raised and that causes equipment to be restricted. It is found that a chlorination reaction can be carried out at a relatively low temperature by heating a mixture of granular metallic silicon and metallic copper or a copper compound in an inert atmosphere even when the metallic silicon has a high purity and does not contain aluminum and titanium and that chloropolysilane of high purity can be obtained by further adding metallic silicon as needed after the chlorination reaction is started."
