No. 08/894,400 filed Aug. 18, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,075,110, which is a 371 of PCT/JP96/00354, filed Feb. 16, 1996., 519036=To 100 g of a white paint (pigment/resin=0.833, solid content: 55%, butyl acetate solution) of a blended resin (weight ratio: 30/70) of a vinylidene fluoride copolymer (number average molecular weight: 28,000, weight average molecular weight: 70,000) comprising 74% by mole of vinylidene fluoride, 14.5% by mole of tetrafluoroethylene and 11.5% by mole of chlorotrifluoroethylene and an acrylic polyol (number average molecular weight: 7,000, weight average molecular weight: 18,000) comprising 10% by mole of methyl methacrylate, 50% by mole of isobutyl methacrylate, 29% by mole of t-butyl methacrylate, 1% by mole of methacrylic acid and 10% by mole of hydroxyethyl methacrylate, were added 3.0 g of 4F-35 synthesized in the same manner as in Preparation Example 13 (10 parts by weight on the basis of 100 parts by weight of the resin), 1.5 g of SR2404 (methyl group-containing organopolysiloxane available from Toray Dow Corning Silicone Kabushiki Kaisha), 1.5 g of methyltrimethoxysilane, 0.02 g of aluminium tris(acetylacetonate), 2.8 g of Coronate HX, 60 g of butyl acetate and 5.0 g of N,N-dimethylacetamide, followed by mixing sufficiently. The obtained paint composition was spray-coated on a dull-finished steel plate (0.5 mm thick), dried and cured at room temperature for one week to give a coated plate having a coating thickness of about 40 \u03bcm. Then the same tests as in Example 19 were carried out. The results are shown in Table 18., 40975=Examples of employing a silane compound as a curing moiety as mentioned above are also proposed in JP-B-45-11309, JP-A-5-78612, JP-A-61-258852, JP-A-62-116673, JP-A-64-75575, JP-A-2-232221, JP-A-2-240153, JP-A-4-211482, JP-A-4-65476 and JP-A-4-292677. However, curing is insufficient due to large contents of alcohol and water. On the other hand, since a silicate originally has hydroxyl group or requires high temperature baking, migration of the silicate to the surface of coating film is inhibited. Also there is a problem that since the silane compound has a non-hydrolyzable group, hydrophilic property is insufficient. Due to the mentioned reasons, the stain-proofing property is not improved like the above-mentioned other proposals., 556906=A film of 0.13 mm in thickness was prepared by uniformly mixing 100 parts of SG-1400 (vinyl chloride resin available from Ryonichi-; Kabushiki Kaisha), 43 parts of dioctyl phthalate, 3 parts of ADK CIZER O-130P (epoxidated soy bean oil available from Adk Argus Kabushiki Kaisha), 5 parts of tricresyl phosphate (available from Daihachi Kagaku Kabushiki Kaisha), 2 parts of Mark AC-153 (barium-zinc stabilizer available from Adk Argus Kabushiki Kaisha), 0.5 part of barium stearate, 1.0 part of zinc stearate, 0.5 part of sorbitan monopalmitate, 1.0 part of sorbitan monostearate and 0.8 part of Tinuvin 327 (ultraviolet ray absorber available from Ciba Geigy Co., Ltd.), followed by calender rolling., 566338=Excited X-ray: Mg, K\u03b1 rays (1253, 6 ev), 88649=Examples of the commercially available metal oxide are, for instance, those available from Kyowa Kagaku Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha such as Kyowaad 115 (MgO), Kyowaad 200 (Al2O3.XH2O), Kyowaad 300 (2.5MgO.Al2O3.XH2O), Kyowaad 400 (Al2O3.Na2O.XH2O), Kyowaad 500 (Mg6Al2(OH)16CO3.4H2O), Kyowaad 600 (2MgO.6SiO2.XH2O), Kyowaad 700, 715 (Al2O3.9SiO2.XH2O), Kyowaad 815 (Mg(OH)2), Kyowaad 1000 (Mg4.5Al2(OH)13CO3.3.5H2O), Kyowaad 1015 (Mg4.5Al2(OH)13CO3.3.5H2O, Particle size 1.5 mm), Kyowaad 2000 (Mg1\u2212xAlxO1+x/2, x=0.3) and Kyowaad 2015 (Mg1\u2212xAlxO1+x/2, x=0.3, Particle size 1.5 mm) and the like. From the viewpoint of adsorption of impurities, Kyowaad 600 is preferred., 522026=To 100 g of a GK-500-based white paint prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 were added 3.0 g of 4F-35 synthesized in the same manner as in Preparation Example 13 (10 parts by weight on the basis of 100 parts by weight of a resin), 5.0 g of SR2404 (methyl group-containing organopolysiloxane available from Toray Dow Corning Silicone Kabushiki Kaisha), 0.5 g of FZ-3739 (dimethyl silicone which is block-modified with polyether at both ends thereof), 0.5 g of 3-trimethoxysilylpropylisocyanate, 0.5 g of methyltrimethoxysilane, 0.1 g of aluminium tris(acetylacetonate), 10.2 g of Takenate D-140N and 60 g of butyl acetate, followed by mixing sufficiently. The obtained paint composition was spray-coated on a dull-finished steel plate (0.5 mm thick), dried and cured at room temperature for one week to give a coated plate having a coating thickness of about 40 \u03bcm. Then the same tests as in Example 19 were carried out. The results are shown in Table 18., 520573=A white paint (pigment/resin=0.833, solid content: 55%, butyl acetate solution) of an acrylic silicon resin (number average molecular weight: 3,500, weight average molecular weight: 9,100) comprising 100 parts of \u03b3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, 300 parts of methyl methacrylate, 90 parts of n-butyl methacrylate, 500 parts of n-butyl acrylate and 10 parts of acrylamide was prepared. To 100 g of the white paint were added 1.5 g of 4F-35 synthesized in the same manner as in Preparation Example 13 (5 parts by weight on the basis of 100 parts by weight of the resin), 5.0 g of SR2404 (methyl group-containing organopolysiloxane available from Toray Dow Corning Silicone Kabushiki Kaisha), 0.5 g of methyltrimethoxysilane, 0.1 g of aluminium tris(acetylacetonate), 0.05 g of tetrabutoxy titanium, 0.4 g of a reaction product of an epoxy resin (Epikote 828 (bisphenol A type resin available from Yuka Shell Epoxy Kabushiki Kaisha)) and \u03b3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (weight ratio: 1/1), 20 g of butyl acetate and 1 g of ethanol, followed by mixing sufficiently. The obtained paint composition was spray-coated on a dull-finished steel plate (0.5 mm thick), dried and cured at room temperature for one week to give a coated plate having a coating thickness of about 40 \u03bcm. Then the same tests as in Example 19 were carried out. The results are shown in Table 18., 138827=As the epoxy resin, there can be cited, for example, bisphenol epoxy resin such as commercially available Epikote 828, 834, 836, 1001, 1004 and DX-255 which are trade names of Shell Kagaku Kabushiki Kaisha, Araldite GY-260 which is trade name of Ciba Geigy, DER 330, 331 and 337 which are trade names of Dow Chemical or Epiclon 800 which is trade name of Dai Nippon Ink Kagaku Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha; phenol-novolac epoxy resin such as commercially available DEN 431 and 438 which are trade names of Dow Chemical; polyglycol epoxy resin such as commercially available Araldite CT-508 which is trade name of Ciba Geigy or DER-732 and 736 which are trade names of Dow Chemical; ester epoxy resin such as Epiclon 200 and 400 which are trade names of Dai Nippon Ink Kagaku Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha; and cotton-like aliphatic epoxy resin such as an epoxidated polybutadiene like BF-1000 which is trade name of Nippon Soda Kabushiki Kaisha., 564049=Thereon was roll-coated a synthetic resin primer comprising 40 parts of Almatex L-1043 (thermoplastic acrylic resin available from Mitsui Toatsu Kabushiki Kaisha), 10 parts of BKS-2750 (epoxy-phenol resin available from Showa Union Gosei Kabushiki Kaisha), 10 parts of VAGH (vinyl acetate-vinyl chloride copolymer resin available from UCC) and 20 parts of Titan R-820 (titanium dioxide available from Ishihara Sangyo Kabushiki Kaisha), followed by baking at 200\ufffd C. for one minute to form a 3 \u03bcm thick adhesive layer. Then on the obtained layer was roll-coated a paint composition for top coating, followed by baking at 245\ufffd C for 90 seconds to form a 25 \u03bcm thick fluorine-containing resin coating film. The paint was prepared by adding 5F-46 synthesized in the same manner as in Preparation Example 3, in an amount of 10 parts by weight on the basis of 100 parts by weight of a resin, to a white paint (organosol solution of isophorone) comprising a mixture resin of (1) VP-850 (vinylidene fluoride polymer available from Daikin Industries, Ltd., melting viscosity: 1.7 to 3.3 g/10 minutes, 280\ufffd C., load: 10 kg) and (2) an acrylic silicon resin (number average molecular weight: 18,000, weight average molecular weight: 52,000) comprising 75% by mole of methyl methacrylate, 15% by mole of isobutyl methacrylate and 10% by mole of \u03b3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (weight ratio: (1)/(2)=7/3)., 524950=To 100 g of a GK-500-based white paint prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 were added 3.0 g of 4F-PE prepared in Preparation Example 15 (10 parts by weight on the basis of 100 parts by weight of a resin), 3.0 g of SR2404 (methyl group-containing organopolysiloxane available from Toray Dow Corning Silicone Kabushiki Kaisha), 0.5 g of 3-triethoxysilylpropylisocyanate, 0.5 g of dimethyldimethoxysilane, 0.1 g of aluminium tris(ethylacetoacetate), 10.2 g of Takenate D-140N, 60 g of butyl acetate, 5.0 g of N-methylacetamide and 10.0 g of 2-methoxyethylacetate, followed by mixing sufficiently. The obtained paint composition was spray-coated on a dull-finished steel plate (0.5 mm thick), dried and cured at room temperature for one week to give a coated plate having a coating thickness of about 40 \u03bcm. Then the same tests as in Example 19 were carried out. The results are shown in Table 18., 39380=In recent years, a solvent-soluble fluoroolefincopolymer containing hydroxyl group or carboxyl group has been used as an ultra-high weather resistive coating resin, and the use thereof has been increasing. It is known that copolymers of fluoroolefin with vinyl ether, vinyl ester or the like, which is proposed in, for example, JP-B-60-21686, JP-A-3-121107, JP-A-4-279612 and JP-A-4-28707, are soluble in usual solvent for paints, and in combination use with a curing agent such as isocyanate or melamine, can be baked or cured at normal temperature to form coating films excellent in weather resistance., 523998=To 100 g of a GK-500-based white paint prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 were added 3.0 g of 4F-H synthesized in the same manner as in Preparation Example 14 (10 parts by weight on the basis of 100 parts by weight of a resin), 3.0 g of SR2404 (methyl group-containing organopolysiloxane available from Toray Dow Corning Silicone Kabushiki Kaisha), 0.5 g of 3-triethoxysilylpropylisocyanate, 0.5 g of dimethyldimethoxysilane, 0.1 g of aluminium tris(ethylacetoacetate), 10.2 g of Takenate D-140N and 60 g of butyl acetate, followed by mixing sufficiently. The obtained paint composition was spray-coated on a dull-finished steel plate (0.5 mm thick), dried and cured at room temperature for one week to give a coated plate having a coating thickness of about 40 \u03bcm. Then the same tests as in Example 19 were carried out. The results are shown in Table 18., 41957=Further, as disclosed in WO94/06870, WO95/02645, JP-A-7-109435, JP-A-7-82520, JP-A-7-136583 and JP-A-7-136584, very recently techniques for improving stain-proofing property by adding an alkyl silicate to paints have come to be known, but the resulting coating films have disadvantages that hydrophilization of the coating film surface (stain-proofing property) cannot be repeatedly obtained, and that appearance and alkali resistance of the coating film are poor., 92054=Examples of the fluoroolefin copolymer having hydroxyl group and/or carboxyl group are, for instance, those disclosed in each of JP-B-60-21686, JP-A-3-121107, JP-A-4-279612, JP-A-4-28707 and JP-A-2-232221. A number average molecular weight of the copolymer (measured by GPC) is from 1,000 to 100,000, preferably 1,500 to 30,000. When the molecular weight is less than 1,000, curability and weather resistance tend to be insufficient, and when more than 100,000, there is a tendency that problems arise with respect to workability and coating procedures., 140475=As the curing agent, there are cited, for instance, polyamide resins such as commercially available Tohmide Y-25, 245, 2400 and 2500 which are trade names of Fuji Kasei Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha, Zenamide 2000 and Versamide 115 and 125 which are trade names of Dai-ichi General Kabushiki Kaisha, Sunmide 320, 330 and X2000 which are trade names of Sanwa Kagaku Kabushiki Kaisha, and Epicure 3255 and 4255 which are trade names of Shell Kagaku Kabushiki Kaisha; amine adducts such as Tohmide 238 and Fujicure 202 which are trade names of Fuji Kasei Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha and Adeca Hardener EH-531 which is trade name of Asahi Denka Kabushiki Kaisha; aliphatic polyamines such as Sunmide T-100, D-100 and P-100 which are trade names of Sanwa Kagaku Kabushiki Kaisha; and heterocyclic diamine derivatives such as Epomate B-002, C-002 and S-005 available from Ajinomoto Kabushiki Kaisha., 523075=To 100 g of a GK-500-based white paint prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 were added 3.0 g of 4F-35 synthesized in the same manner as in Preparation Example 13 (10 parts by weight on the basis of 100 parts by weight of a resin), 3.0 g of SR2404 (methyl group-containing organopolysiloxane available from Toray Dow Corning Silicone Kabushiki Kaisha), 0.5 g of 3-triethoxysilylpropylisocyanate, 1.0 g of methyltris(ethylmethylketoxime)silane, 10.2 g of Takenate D-140N and 60 g of butyl acetate, followed by mixing sufficiently. The obtained paint composition was spray-coated on a dull-finished steel plate (0.5 mm thick), dried and cured at room temperature for one week to give a coated plate having a coating thickness of about 40 \u03bcm. Then the same tests as in Example 19 were carried out. The results are shown in Table 18., 135294=Examples of HALS are, for instance, Tinuvin-770, 292, 622123 and 440 available from Ciba Geigy and the like., 492857=To an inorganic material prepared by mixing 25 g of DC-3037 (organopolysiloxane containing methyl and phenyl and being available from Toray Dow Corning Silicone Kabushiki Kaisha), 15 g of SR2404 (organopolysiloxane containing methyl and being available from Toray Dow Corning Silicone Kabushiki Kaisha), 40 g of methyltrimethoxysilane, 10 g of dimethyldimethoxysilane and 5 g of titanium tetra-n-butoxide were added 19 g of 5F-4 6 synthesized in the same manner as in Preparation Example 3 (20 parts by weight on the basis of 100 parts by weight of the inorganic material), 2.5 g of aluminium tris(acetylacetonate), 2.0 g of ethyl acetoacetate and 0.5 g of ethanol, followed by mixing sufficiently. The obtained paint composition was spray-coated on a dull-finished steel plate (0.5 mm thick, previously coated with GK-500-based white/Takenate D-140N), dried and cured at room temperature for one week to give a coated plate having a coating thickness of about 40 \u03bcm. Then the same tests as in Example 66 were carried out. The results are shown in Table 17.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As it is clear from the above-mentioned results, the non-aqueous composition for paints of the present invention can form a coating film being remarkably excellent in stain-proofing property, and the stain-proofing agent of the present invention can improve stain-proofing property of paints, etc. remarkably. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY Also the contact angle of water (after a lapse of six months) is lowered extremely with increase of the adding amount of the compound. It is presumed that at least around the surface and further around the outermost surface, water in the air reacts with a SiOCH3 group to change it to a hydrophilic SiOH group and that a reaction with the fluorine-containing resin for curing does not arise. As it is clear from Table 19, the F/Si ratio is lowered remarkably with increase of the adding amount of the above-mentioned compound. This means that around the surface of the coating film, there is a very small amount of fluorine-containing resin and on the contrary, an amount of Si is considerably large. Therefore, it can be concluded that there exists a large amount of the above-mentioned compound as an additive rather than as a curing agent for the fluorine-containing resin. 0.12 35 80 Ex. 2 0.13 46",
