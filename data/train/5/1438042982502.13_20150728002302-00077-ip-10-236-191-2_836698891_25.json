The Hoosiers players are confident in being prepared for that first road league victory today. \"As I said before, a defining moment for our team this year was our win at Evansville,\" said Crean. \"Our approach was outstanding and we have built off that experience which has allowed us to play pretty well away from Assembly Hall.\" The Hoosiers have won twice on the road but fell at Michigan State in their only conference game away from Assembly Hall. \"Coach Chambers' teams get after it every possession and you can see that they play really well together,\" said Crean. \"They have a number of guys who are playing bigger roles and they are responding to the challenge.\" The Purdue win moved Penn State to 1-2 in conference and 9-7 overall. Other major conference wins for the Lions before this week included an ACC/Big Ten Challenge victory over Boston College (62-54) and a neutral court 53-49 win over South Florida of the Big East. \"Tim Frazier is playing as well as anyone in the league and he does a great job of getting in the lane as he looks to score",
