The DJ plays songs to get the crowd moving, and sometimes the DJ picks people from the crowd to dance on stage. Also, at hump Wednesday we have step battles between the Frat groups and other battles between the Sororities. Also, a lot of celebrities visit our school because Morehouse is well known. We have Celebrity Basketball games. Also, every year around October, we have Homecomings where celebrities come, and we also have dances during Homecoming. I would love to go on about how much fun we have at Morehouse, but it would go far beyond 300 words., 49436=Morehouse College Is Great For Those Types Of Students Whom Wish To Follow The Great Foot Steps Of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Those Foot Steps Of Spike Lee, And The Other Who May Have Came Before Them., 58357=The residence halls represent different learning communities dependent upon your major and career aspirations. For example, Brazeal Hall is primarily for iSTEM (Innovations in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) students. This is an easy way to form study groups and find students that have common academic interests. Also, there is a friendly rivalry between freshmen residence halls. We have step team and stroll team competitions, and also a year-long competition for residence hall of the year. Now, for the bad. Bathroom facilities are communal so they are shared with everyone on your floor. Not all men are sanitary, so it can get a little annoying. Another bad thing is that freshmen are not allowed to have female visitation in the residence halls until after homecoming, which doesn't happen until mid-October., 343050=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 52143=As A Prospective Student I Would Recommend You To Realize That There Is A Difference Between A Boy And A MAN!!!

There's a bunch of other school's in Atlanta, so if you ever get tired of being in the AUC you can always head to Georgia State, Emory, GA Tech just to name a few and find something to get into. It's very easy to meet people and make new friends. You'll have PLENTY of opportunities to meet Clark and Spelman girls so don't worry. There will be a lot of 5 Star rated Spelman girls with deep pockets so, ummm yea. It really is a cool place to be, and the people and the whole Atlanta atmosphere really makes up for some of Morehouse's shortcomings. Am learning a lot How you do and how much you learn your freshman year really depends on how challenging your high school was. To be honest, my freshman year was kind of a breeze. Of course you have to study and make sure you GO TO CLASS, but if you do what you need to do to be successful you'll be fine.
