HRS. \u2022 131 CURRICULUM IN BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING The curriculum in biological engineering provides students with the skills needed to solve today's problems, and the knowledge required to master the rapid changes in technology and address the problems of tomorrow. This curriculum, offered through the College of Engineering, is accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). Graduates are prepared to take the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam during their senior year, which is a first step for obtaining a Professional Engineering license. A low student-to-faculty ratio in the department allows students to receive personal attention. Students also complete a senior design project that requires one-on-one direction from a faculty member. Numerous social activities with faculty, staff, and graduate students foster professional camaraderie that extends far beyond the classroom. Students may also gain professional insight and potential employment contacts through participation in a variety of national engineering and technical organizations. Career opportunities in biological engineering include design, development, and implementation of technologies to recycle municipal waste and agricultural byproducts into viable sources of energy; systems to clean contaminated water and soil; equipment and procedures to prevent repetitive motion injuries; processing operations to ensure high quality foods; and machinery or sensors to be applied within human, animal, plant, and ecological systems. Graduates have the opportunity for local, national, or",
