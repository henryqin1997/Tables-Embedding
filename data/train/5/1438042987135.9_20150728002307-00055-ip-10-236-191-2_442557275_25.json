Weidner, Jr., Rising Sun, MD US 09-18-2014 Bulk Media Spreader Transversal Actuator Assembly With Kinematic Hyperextension Prevention - A bulk media spreader transversal actuator assembly includes a drive converter. A motor is connected to the drive converter. A linear motion shaft is slideably positioned in a shaft housing. The shaft housing is connected to the drive converter and the linear motion shaft is connected to the drive converter such that rotational operation of the motor is converted to a linear motion of the linear motion shaft by the drive converter. A hyperextension prevention device is connected to the linear motion shaft and to a rotatable lever of a bulk media spreader. Rotatable displacement of the lever by extension or retraction of the linear motion shaft acts to change an operating position of a hopper gate through which media in the bulk media spreader is dispensed. 20140263762 Published Description Patent application number Joseph K.

STOLONIFERUM; PERENNIAL RYEGRASS WITH DETERMINATE-STOLONS - This disclosure provides perennial ryegrass plants having determinate-stolons developed by subjecting large number of perennial ryegrass plants to intense traffic. This grass can quickly repair (high regeneration potential) itself from traffic damage, and has good turf qualities compared to other perennial ryegrasses. The high regeneration potential gives it the ability to quickly repair itself from traffic damage and fill in open areas in turf. Methods of using the perennial ryegrass grass plants and seed are also provided. This grass is suitable for use in turf, for example turf that is exposed to significant traffic. This disclosure also provides methods of selecting for such grass plants. 05-17-2012 Joseph K. Wipff, Iii, Canby, OR US Patent application number Description Published 20140215651 KENTUCKY BLUEGRASS VARIETY NAMED 'BARVETTE' SELECTED FOR HEALTHY TURF - The present invention is directed toward Kentucky bluegrass varieties containing mutant allele BARHGTMA1 that exhibit resistance to diseases, pests and traffic. Specifically, the Kentucky bluegrass variety of the present invention, \u2018Barvette\u2019, exhibits the unique and surprising combination of resistance to Summer Patch caused by the fungus 07-31-2014 Website \u00a9 2015 Advameg, Inc.",
