The percent improvement can be determined by subtracting the rating of the composition without KEA from the rating of the composition with the KEA, dividing the result by the rating of the composition without KEA and multiplying by 100. The higher the percent improvement, the greater the effect of the KEA and the more desirable the result. For example, percent improvements of 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 90, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 1500 and higher are more desirable than percent improvements of from 1 to less than 10., 114427=[0058] The complementary organic photochromic compounds may include polymerizable photochromic compounds, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,719,296; 5,166,345; 5,236,958; 5,252,742; 5,359,085; and 5,488,119. Further examples of complementary organic photochromic compounds include naphthopyrans, e.g., naphtho[1,2-b]pyrans and naphtho[2,1-b]pyrans, quinopyrans, indenonaphthopyrans, oxazines, e.g., benzoxazines, naphthoxazines and spiro(indoline)pyridobenzoxazines, phenanthropyrans, e.g., substituted 2H-phenanthro[4,3-b]pyran and 3H-phenanthro[1,2-b]pyran compounds, benzopyrans, e.g., benzopyran compounds having substituents at the 2-position of the pyran ring, and mixtures of such photochromic compounds. Such photochromic compounds are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,562,172; 3,567,605; 3,578,602; 4,215,010; 4,342,668; 4,816,584; 4,818,096; 4,826,977; 4,880,667; 4,931,219; 5,066,818; 5,238,981; 5,274,132; 5,384,077; 5,405,958; 5,429,774; 5,458,814, 5,466,398; 5,514,817; 5,552,090; 5,552,091; 5,565,147; 5,573,712; 5,578,252; 5,637,262; 5,645,767; 5,656,206; 5,658,500; 5,658,501; 5,674,432 and 5,698,141.

Brown, Editor, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1971., 68621=[0001] This Application is a Continuation-In-Part of application Ser. No. 09/724,145 filed Nov. 28, 2000, which application is incorporated herein by reference., 147867=[0100] Examples 12, 13 (10% PEG-900) 14 (10% PCLD) and CE1 were used in a study in which the imbibed lenses were coated with HI-GARD\ufffd 1030 a solgel-type hardcoating solution (HC); HI-GARD\ufffd 1030 solution and Reflection Free antireflective coating (HC & AR); or no coating was applied. The effects of the coatings on the Photochromic Performance Rating as well as the adhesion of the coatings to the lenses was tested. These results are listed in Table 4., 111995=[0054] The combination of organic polyols and epoxy-containing compounds for use in the transfer process or in the removable imbibition composition may be in a weight proportion of from 1:99 to 99:1; 5:95 to 95:5; 10:90 to 90:10; 50:50 or in a proportion between any of these values, inclusive of the recited ratios, e.g., from 30:70 to 60:40., 138129=[0088] The preparation of poly(urea-urethane) is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/766,554, filed Jan. 19, 2001 and in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,866,242; 5,811,506; 5,962,617; and 5,962,619., 260606=[0164] Tables 4 and 5 demonstrate the effects of subsequent coatings applied to the lenses that have been imbibed with 2 different photochromic formulations, respectively, and 3 different kinetic enhancing additives. The imbibed lenses were coated only with HI-GARD\ufffd 1030 solution or HI-GARD 1030\ufffd solution and an antireflective coating by Reflection Free, a divison of Essilor of America, with the commercially available antireflective (AR) coating sold as Relection Free\ufffd Plus. This coating is a vacuum deposited AR coating. In each case a lens having no treatment was used for comparison. The thickness of the cured hardcoat (HC) was about 2 microns.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0169] The present invention has been described with reference to specific details of particular embodiments thereof. It is not intended that such details be regarded as limitations upon the scope of the invention except insofar as to the extent that they are included in the accompanying claims. [0168] The results of Table 7 show that all of the photochromic lenses that were prepared using photochromic imbibition solutions of the present invention in Examples 19-24, got darker after 30 seconds and 15 minutes and faded faster than the photochromic lenses prepared using Comparative Examples 3-6 in the Photochromic Performance Test. The Performance Rating for each of the Example lenses was higher than that of the Comparative Examples. [0167] Table 6 shows the effect of combining an epoxy-containing kinetic enhancing additive (TMPTGE) with an organic polyol (PCLD) in Example 18 as compared to the individual KEA's or CE2 with no KEA, each imbibed 4 or 8 hours. The Performance Rating for Example 15 decreased when the time for imbibition was extended from 4 to 8 hours whereas there was an increase in the 8 hour Performance Rating as compared to the 4 hour Performance Rating of Example 17. The 4 hour Performance Rating for the combination of KEA's in Example 18 (5% TMPTGE and 5% PCLD) unexpectedly demonstrated synergy by having a higher Performance Rating, i.e., 42.2, than either of",
