            "Two fraternities and two sororities. If Greek Life is your main focus, you may want to visit our chapters to see if you could see yourself a part of one.",
            "There is a club for almost any type of student, from photography clubs to science clubs, anyone can find their niche here.",
            "Introverts wanting to become more extroverted. Extroverts wanting to find more extroverts. Introverts wanting to find other introverts to become extroverts with. Pretty much every type of student can be happy at Schreiner. It's what you make it.",
            "The Loop. A circular road that wraps around the entire campus, measuring out to about a mile. Used by students, faculty, and even the Kerrville community for jogging, pet-walking, and star gazing alike. One can see all of the aspects of Schreiner by walking one loop.",
            "There are not many other universities you can go to and run into the president of the university and have a midday chat. There aren't many other universities where you will be able to text your academic adviser whenever you have a question. However, there are tons of universities you can go to if you want to blend into a crowd of 500 students and never meet your professors, and if you prefer the latter over the first two, then Schreiner isn't the place for you.",
            "Go to the river, Schreiner is in the middle of the Texas Hill Country, beautiful! Schreiner's Student Activities Board puts on awesome activities weekly. Get involved - campus involvement is not only fun, but a great way for every student to grow.",
            "Like many other school cafeterias, the food is not perfect, but it is more than just edible.",
            "Living on campus at Schreiner is life changing. You meet friends here that you will keep for the rest of your life. You also get to let yourself come out, your space is your very own sanctuary.",
            "It is academically challenging, but it is totally worth the effort. A good, all around liberal arts education is hard to come by, and you've just found a gem.",
            "VISIT!! Visiting colleges is one of the most important aspects of making the right decision. For me, I thought I was dead set on another university, until I stepped foot onto Schreiner University's campus.",
            "A great place get a major-specific education and liberal arts, widespread knowledge. Very friendly and homey atmosphere. The faculty and staff here REALLY care, you're not just a number."

Remember, you pay for your education so it need to be worth it. Tips for prospective students Be able to do your own work at your own time. It's a competition out there even if they don't say it. Study as much as you can. Don't delay it because you will end up with a low GPA. Don't be surprise not achieving an A because for some class you are lucky to get a C! Bang for the buck It's pricey for this university compare to some other colleges, but 90% of incoming students gets scholarship, including myself. The price is worth it because you get the extra help from professors and one-on-one attention; you are not just a number. When you come up to professor they know exactly who you are and how they can help you. Am enjoying being here I grew up in California a big difference from this school. I knew if I want to success I have to exclude myself from all the partying. It gets lonely at times, but there's always groups to join or activities to do. We have",
