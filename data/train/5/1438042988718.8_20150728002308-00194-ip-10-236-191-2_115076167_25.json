Neither team led by more than a point for the first two minutes of play when, after Sims missed consecutive free throws with 1:17 remaining, Cincinnati's JaQuon Parker picked up an offensive rebound and converted the layup to go up three, 61-58, with 45 seconds to play. With its offense in neutral, Gu opted for a quick basket by Clark and to send Dixon to the line with 10 seconds remaining, hoping for a reprise of Dixon's late miss from the line which keyed the game-tying possession in regulation. Dixon was true to form, missing a free throw that would have put the Bearcats up three in the final seconds. Back came the Hoyas, where this time Sims drove the lane for a layup that beat the buzzer and sent the game into a second overtime at 62-62., 93195=Sims got the ball inside and began to cut into the lead, while freshmen Greg Whittington and Otto Porter stepped up in a game where senior Jason Clark and junior Hollis Thompson were not effective from the field, combining for just 1-10 shooting. Sims rallied the Hoyas with a layup at the 7:51 mark to cut the lead to four, while Whittington hit a long three and completed a three point play at the line to give Georgetown the lead with under three minutes in the half. Sims went to work inside again, and after a Pitt foul on forward Lamar Patterson, some post-foul bantering cost the Panthers a technical foul, and three free throws later, the Panthers were down six. Pitt was held to two field goals over the final 8:02 of the half, and none in the final four minutes. Georgetown carried an eight point lead into the break, 31-023, despite missing three free throws down the stretch., 60433=The March 7, 1972 Washington Post reported four candidates for the vacant Georgetown job: Thompson, DeMatha coach Morgan Wootten, Maryland assistant George Raveling, and former Notre Dame assistant Gene Sullivan. Two days later, Thompson was offered the job. The photo to the right shows director of admissions Charles Deacon, Georgetown president Robert Henle, S.J., and a 30 year old John Thompson at his first press conference., 68128=Following its double overtime loss in the quarterfinals of the Big East tournament, Georgetown will open the 2012 NCAA tournament as the 3rd seed in the Midwest Region, earning the University its 28th NCAA appearance and its 39th post-season bid overall., 83711=In the next two possessions, Hollis Thompson lost the ball and took a bad jumper, but Georgetown's defense held UC in check. Starks was back to the line with 2:08 to play, up three, and missed another front end of the one and one,a nd Bearcats answered inside with a Gates layup, 52-51.Georgetown's momentum was all but lost at this point, opting for a long three pointer by Whittington that missed at the 1:12 mark. Going for a \"two for one\" strategy, Cashmere Wright was stopped inside with 37 seconds to play but GU failed to block out gates, who picked up the offensive rebound and gave Cincinnati a 52-51 lead with 37 seconds remaining, a 14-2 run over the previous eight minutes., 126625=The Pirates' stunning 86-58 loss to DePaul not only dropped the Pirates from 8th to 10th in the league race, but dropped its RPI from 43 to 59, giving the NCAA selection committee ample opportunity to pass on the Pirates and choose other Big East teams this year, including Cincinnati, whose RPI is depressed by an early loss to Presbyterian, but whose best-ever 4th place finish will not be ignored. The Pirates began the season 15-2 after a 21 point win over DePaul on Jan. 10, now stand at 19-11 entering this week's tournament, with its four wins over Rutgers, Pitt, St. John's and...Georgetown., 60987=It's not an understatement to say that everything that Georgetown and its fan base enjoys from basketball today--everything-- took root from this hire. And while the man who the current head coach calls \"Pops\" is not one for looking back, the commitment by the coach and by the University changed the course of college basketball. To all who were a part of that week in March 1972, thank you., 45638=With no points from Sims, six straight misses from Clark since the opening bell of the first half, and just one basket from Otto Porter since the beginning of the game, Hollis Thompson took over the game. Thompson scored seven straight to close the lead to four at the 11:45 mark, 45-41. But as the Hoyas awakened from their slumber and began to make a run at the lead, the Wolfpack met every challenge., 7281=\"Hollis returned for his junior year after submitting his name for the 2011 NBA Draft,\" said coach John Thompson III in the statement. \"We fully anticipated he would enter the 2012 draft after this season. He is an extremely hard worker and we wish him the best as he takes his next step.\", 75428=While this site was on break, Big East officials confirmed that Temple University will join the Big East for the 2012-13 football season and for basketball in 2013-14, joining Central Florida, Houston, Memphis, and Southern Methodist., 80465=With 9:11 to play in Thursday's quarterfinal versus Cincinnati, Georgetown was on its way to a Friday match with top seeded Syracuse. It was at that point that Cincinnati coach Mick Cronin reluctantly went to a man to man defense, and GU's path to the Big East championship took a turn for the worse., 68397=Among nine Big East selections, the Hoyas will play in Friday in Columbus, OH against Belmont, the champions of the Atlantic Sun conference. The schools last met in the first round of the 2007 NCAA tournament., 42128=Forward C.J. Leslie's basket closed to eight at the 4:57 mark, with Mikael Hopkins picking up a turnover and second foul twenty seconds later. Off a missed free throw, guard C.J. Williams grabbed the rebound and took the basket, 25-19. Jabril Trawick took a long three pointer which missed, and guard Lorenzo Brown drilled a three in return, 25-22. On the next series, Clark lost the ball and Williams answered with a layup, 25-24., 66486=\ufffdI don\ufffdt know that I\ufffdvet seen more than eight or 10 minutes of their games this year,\ufffd said Belmont coach Rick Byrd. \"I don\ufffdt know how much they've changed since we played them in 2007... [but] we're a whole different team than the last time we played.\", 133273=The MU lead floated above double digits for the next five minutes, whereupon Otto Porter's jumper at the 14:11 mark got the Hoyas to within eight, 51-43. Back came the Warriors to the foul line, with Henry Sims picking up a fourth foul and MU scoring its next seven at the line, 58-45. Sims fouled out midway in the half with five points and was not the factor expected in this game., 86957=Dixon opened the second overtime without split at the line, as each team soon answered with a field goal of its own. A Gates free throw tied the game at 66-66, and off a GU turnover, Gates fed Dixon for a layup, 68-66, with 2:29 remaining. Both teams were stopped on consecutive possessions, and Gu got a much needed response from Markel Starks, with an arching jumper with 1:04, 68-68. UC drove inside with Gates with 45 seconds remaining, answered by Sims 17 seconds later, 70-70. Holding for the last shot, Gates was contained inside but Wright saw a gap in the middle of the court he could not refuse., 40564=The 2012 game had marked differences from those two losses, however. Georgetown got ahead early in this one, 8-3, with five quick points from freshman Otto Porter to start the game, and three free throws from Jason Clark. Georgetown's first roadblock in the game came two fouls over three possessions to senior center Henry Sims, sending him to the bench without a point at the 14:20 mark. Much as the case Friday, Nate Lubick moved to the pivot, and much like Friday, Lubick followed Sims to the sidelines with a second foul at the 8:29 mark, with Georgetown up 15-11. A basket and foul shots on consecutive possessions by Hollis Thompson pushed the lead to 19-11 at the 7:30 mark., 78693=The New York Post reported last week that the conference and MSG officials are closing in on an extension to its agreement to host Big East games through 2026., 82340=Georgetown continued its ascent to open the second half, with assists on its first two field goals and a nine point lead in the first three minutes until a pair of turnovers keyed an 8-0 Bearcat run, with points coming from the inside, especially from center Yancy Gates. But as Cincinnati fired, Georgetown fired right back, with a 11-3 run where the Hoyas made six of eight shots from the field to take a nine point lead with 10:11 to play. A pair of Jason Clark free throws put the Hoyas up by 11 at the 9:11 mark, 49-38. A day earlier, the Hoyas were up 50-39 against Pitt and closed the door on the Panthers soon thereafter. Out of a time out, Cronin opted for a man to man defense to turn up the heat and the Hoyas' offense went into meltdown., 3904=In a Twitter post at 2:00 pm EDT, Wright said: \"I'm overwhelmed by everyone's concern about the possibility of me having MS but as of right now nothing is certain...if everyone will just let this issue rest, I would gladly appreciate it. Once again, thanks for all the support, God bless.\", 94841=If Pitt had no good answer for Porter, it was equally overmatched inside. Henry Sims continued to control the middle, and put the Hoyas up 13 with 9:04 to play. Defensively, the Panthers went six minutes without a field goal, hanging around via the free throw line but never closing into single digits. A 9-2 Georgetown run, including a 7-8 run from the free throw line, pushed the lead to 17 and the Panthers had no chance to come back. GU led by as many as 19 before emptying the bench, with Pitt closing the gap to 12 at the end of the game. While it was highly unlikely that Pitt could make a five game run through the tournament as UConn did a season ago, Wednesday's loss officially ended a ten year run of NCAA tournament appearances for the Panthers., 81160=Defense was the order of the day in the opening minutes, as the teams combined for two field goals over the first four minutes. Back to back threes from UC's Sean Kilpatrick and Georgetown's Hollis Thompson were illusory--the two combined to miss their remaining eight outside attempts as neither team could mount any scoring effort from outside. Cincinnati shot just 38 percent in the first half but the Hoyas led by no more than three entering the final five minutes of the first half, whereupon Georgetown hit the offensive boards and began to pick up space in the scoring column. With UC held to one field goal in the final five minutes of the half, GU went inside with Jason Clark, Otto Porter, and henry Sims to push to lead to 30-24 at the break. Georgetown surrendered only two turnovers all half, and none in the final 16:25., 76984=The decision does not come without compromise, however, as Villanova University had expressed concerns over adding a second school within its market. As part of the decision to admit Temple, the Big East will work with Villanova to help fund a study which could elevate the Wildcats' football program (one of two schools, along with Georgetown to play football at the I-AA level), after the 2015 season., 46056=After a double technical on GU's Markel Starks and Lorenzo Brown returned the ball to State's possession, Brown missed on a long three, but Leslie muscled in for the rebound and the tip-in, 47-41. Markel Starks rallied the Hoyas' hopes with a three, 47-44, only to see NC State's Scott Wood answer thusly, 50-44. A Nate Lubick layup was the only basket scored by either team for a four minute stretch of defensive stops and free throws, with Sims back in the game on an offense-defense rotation. With 4:30 left, a missed free throw by Whittington that would have closed the lead to thee was met with a deep three from Wood. 57-50, and the Wolfpack answered a Clark lay-in with an offensive rebound and basket with 2:12 to play, 59-52., 8052=A gifted outside shooter who averaged 47 percent from the field and 43 percent from three point range, Thompson's career numbers remain a step below that of previous early entrants such as Mike Sweetney, Jeff Green, or Dajuan Summers. In 99 games, Thompson averaged just 8.6 points and 4.0 rebounds, with an 11.8 per game average in Big East play this past season. Thompson scored 20 or more in six games over his career, with a career high 26 in the 2011 NCAA tournament versus Virginia Commonwealth. Career wise, Thompson ranks 59th in scoring with 853 points, and 56th in rebounds with 404., 53951=With little success on the perimeter, the Bruins tried to move inside to open the defense, and a 5-0 run closed the lead to 42-36 with 15:21 to play, only to be answered by a 8-2 run which saw Georgetown score on four straight possessions, part of a second half in which it was 16-23 from the field, most of which leveraged Georgetown's height inside. GU led by as many as 15 when Belmont was able to convert a pair of three point plays from the foul line and shave the lead to nine at the 5:41 mark, 58-49. Again, the Hoyas answered the challenge, as Georgetown scored on five straight possessions: a Sims jumper, a Clark run out triggered from a big Greg Whittington block, a Whittington pass to Sims inside, a Hollis Thompson jumper, and a Whittington pass to Porter for the basket and the foul, 70-51., 41694=Over the next ten minutes, five to end the first half and five to end the second, the game was lost. As State tightened its defense inside, and absent Sims or Lubick to effect passing lanes, Georgetown opted for a run of poor shooting from outside, with little or no rebounding help. Georgetown managed one offensive rebound in the final 6:53 of the half, and when the Hoyas began to miss its shots, State took full advantage., 68621=\"Belmont is located in Nashville, Tennessee and this is their fifth-ever NCAA tournament appearance, which i sn\ufffdt particularly impressive until you consider that their first appearance was in 2006,\" writes The HOYA. Their second appearance (2007) saw them face off against second-seeded Georgetown, and the Blue and Gray won by 25 to kick off their run to the Final Four. In 2008 the 15th-seeded Bruins (nearly) captured the hearts of the country when they lost by one to Duke in the first round. Last year saw them win a program-high 30 games and qualify for the tourney, but the result was no different as they lost by 14 to Wisconsin.\", 76457=Temple, a member of the Atlantic-10 since 1982-83, was an associated member of the Big East in football from 1991-2004, but was pushed out for a lack of commitment and poor attendance, averaging under 5,000 a game at one point in the mid-1990's. Now, with attendance averaging 28,000 a game and recent bowl success, the timing was deemed right to add Temple for all sports and to provide an additional asset in basketball. This past season, the Owls were24-7 and were awarded a fifth seed in the NCAA tournament., 73885=With the 2012 Final Four returning to New Orleans, Georgetown fans can expect lots of coverage recalling the first Final Four in the Crescent City, where the mythic final between Georgetown and North Carolina changed the game. Yahoo Sports tracked down a central figure in that game, Fred Brown, who is preparing for a change of careers., 92445=Defense and youth served the Georgetown Hoyas to an opening win in the 2012 Big East tournament, powering past Pittsburgh 64-52 at Madison Square Garden., 132745=Marquette coach Buzz Williams didn't need to be reminded of the 17 points second half lead lost by MU against Georgetown in January, and neither did his players. The Warriors opened the second half with the press, as consecutive backcourt turnovers by Clark keyed a 9-1 Marquette run to push the lead to 17, 48-31. A pair of free throws and a three by Hollis Thompson narrowed the margin to 12, 48-36, but Thompson was not a factor for the next 11 minutes of play, as he failed to take a single shot until the 5:40 mark., 77677=Georgetown and Temple first met in basketball in the 1928-29 season and have played 35 games through the 2009-10 season, with Temple owing a 21-14 advantage. The schools met five times in football from 1938 through 1942., 40246=The 11th seeded Wolfpack outscored the Hoyas 15-2 to end the first half and held on late for a 66-63 win in third round NCAA play in Columbus, OH, ending the Hoyas' 2011-12 season on the same day as it did for the prior two seasons: a loss on March 18, 2010 to Ohio and March 18, 2011 to Virginia Commonwealth., 7606=Thompson was the school's first \"greenshirt\" recruit, arriving to campus a semester early in the spring of 2009. Though he did not play for the team in 2008-09, it has allowed him to be within range to graduate a year early, perhaps by this summer, which may also have played a role in the decision to leave rather than pursue further studies., 101355=It's Big East Week, and this site will not be updated through Sunday evening. There are plenty of links available to follow the teams and the 2012 brackets, however., 67513=The final women's poll is due Tuesday. As of March 5, Georgetown is ranked #17. Other conference teams in the Top 25 include Connecticut (3), Notre Dame (4), St. John's (14), Louisville (19), and Rutgers (23)., 117737=Home attendance averages for upcoming Big East members in 2013-14 are also provided below:, 6024=Tuesday: Ten Memorable Games Of 1981-82 Wednesday: The Semifinal vs. Louisville Thursday: The Final vs. North Carolina Friday: The 1981-82 Hoyas: Where Are They Now?, 46805=Still down seven, Hollis Thompson connected from three to close to four at the 1:00 mark, 61-57. GU fouled State center Richard Howell (9 pts, 9 rebs), who missed the second free throw, now up five. Henry Sims got inside for a layup, his only basket of the game, 62-59., 59356=Friday's opener with Belmont marks Georgetown's 28th appearance in the NCAA tournament and its 72nd game all-time in the tournament. And excepting the three games of the 1943 tournament, radio announcer Rich Chvotkin has been a part of 66 of them, with a half-season lost to military service in Kuwait in 1991. WUSA-TV has an online feature about Chvotkin, who has called NCAA games from Tuscaloosa to Boise and everywhere in-between., 52414=Belmont entered the game ranked 10th nationally in three point field goals and struck early, with three pointers on three of its first four baskets. The Bruins took an 8-7 lead early but no further, thanks to Clark, who scored 10 of his game high 21 to open the game, giving the Hoyas a 14-8 lead seven minutes into the first half. Georgetown's effective use of perimeter defense limited the Bruins at nearly every turn, extending the lead to six when Henry Sims was sent to the bench with a second personal foul at the 11:15 mark. Sophomore Nate Lubick moved into the pivot and played well in relief, picking up consecutive assists as GU extended the lead to 11 at the 8:31 mark, 26-15., 127245=A team in green is among the range of likely NCAA at-large entrants, a team in gray is likely not to be selected. (Georgetown's record below is reflective of the fact that its Nov.22 game with Chaminade, a Div. II team, does not count in RPI totals.), 78221=In the midst of the announcement of Syracuse and Pitt to the ACC in September, ACC officials appeared to insult the conference by casually suggesting that the ACC would supplant the Big East tournament at Madison Square Garden, where the league has held its championship since 1983. Now, with the league growing to 18 schools by 2014, efforts are being made to ensure the Big East--not the ACC--has a home at the World's Most Famous Arena for years to come., 79297=An added plus for the Garden? Revenue. The Big East will make an annual commitment where any agreement with the ACC would effectively bring no more than one tournament every five years to the building. The ACC has already committed to the Greensboro Coliseum through 2016, with additional venues in Charlotte, Atlanta, Tampa, and Washington DC (Verizon Center) likely in future rotations., 35296=Diamond's Twitter feed remarked that \"I'm already taking heat for this story: Georgetown as tournament chokers. [A] reader said I belong to the Syracuse mafia.\" As a 2010 graduate of Syracuse and a former columnist at the Daily Orange, Diamond failed to heed the advice from one of his own columns. \"The problem with college basketball is there's not a big gap,\" said Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim in a 2010 Daily Orange column written by Diamond. \"If you don't play well, whoever it is you're playing can beat you. It's as simple as that.\", 47089=Brown was sent to the line to close the door, but missed the front and of the one and one and Sims answered with two at the line with 37 seconds left, 63-62. Wood was sent to the line and again missed a critical shot, giving the Hoyas the ball with 36 seconds remaining, down two. The offensive sets were going nowhere when head coach John Thompson III called the team's last time out with 0:24 left. NC State kept Hollis Thompson in check and Porter opted for a 12 foot jumper that fell short and Sims was tagged with his fifth foul, yelling back at Porter in frustration for either the shot or the need for Sims to pick up the foul., 39672=For the better part of half the 2011-12 season, the first half offensive lulls of the Georgetown Hoyas were usually met with a defensive stand that would keep the opponent at bay. Two days earlier, for example, the Hoyas went five minutes without a basket against Belmont, but the Bruins could not cut more than three points off the lead, whereupon the Hoyas returned to form and ultimately, to victory., 131538=Georgetown closed to three at the 8:17 mark, and trailed by five at 25-20 when the Warriors got a big boost from their biggest player. Center Davante Gardner, who had been out due to injury, limped off the bench and, though largely immobile on defense, scored six of the Warriors' next eight to extend the lead to 33-26 at the four minute mark. As Marquette finished the half shooting 14-15 from the line, Georgetown failed in return. With the Hoyas shooting the bonus, Jason Clark missed the front end of a one and one, down five, and a Gardner tip-in put them down seven. Greg Whittington then missed the front end at the 3:05 mark, and 39 seconds later, with a basket and a foul shot, Clark missed a free throw. Georgetown missed four of its final six at the line as the Warriors outscored the Hoyas 6-1 to end the half with 39-29 lead., 34704=There's an old saying in sports: \"the loudest noise comes from the cheap seats.\" Today's first entrant is Jared Diamond, a writer for the Wall Street Journal, who labeled Georgetown the \"Monet of choke artists\" for its loss at the buzzer to North Carolina State on Sunday. (Ironically, the accompanying graphic to his story does not even list GU, but does list his alma mater, Syracuse University, with five such losses since 1985.), 66047=\"The Hoyas started this season 12-1 and climbed to No. 9 nationally,\" it writes, \"but they lost seven of their last 16 and were eliminated from the Big East tournament in the quarterfinals, 72-70 double-overtime game with Cincinnati.\" Of those seven losses, six were to teams in the 2012 NCAA tournament field. By contrast, Belmont has won 14 straight but only two of its seven losses were to NCAA teams., 110601=Here's the all time record of the Hoyas in the tournament against the 15 other teams in the 2012 tournament. Other than a single loss to Rutgers in 1998, Connecticut is the only opponent to whom Georgetown has a losing record in Big East tournament play., 53341=But as with Sims, Lubick got into foul trouble and the Hoyas' offense took its usual first half break, going nearly five minutes without a basket. To its credit, however, Georgetown's defense held the Bruins' outside game in check and when Otto Porter hit a three at the 3:45 mark, GU was up eleven, 30-22., 131046=An unexpected three pointer by center Jamil Wilson gave the Warriors the lead at 16-14, and with a 7-2 run they never looked back. A key to the Marquette attack was the foul line. Although Marquette did not get into the bonus until the 5:04 mark, every foul from the first to the sixth were shooting fouls, enabling Marquette 10 extra free throws, and they converted all ten., 61703=At the start of the season, many assumed the Hoyas would go as far as Hollis Thompson or Jason Clark could take them. Now, well into March, it's how far Henry Sims can take them., 41254=N.C. State struggled to get offensive consistency in the game, starting 2-11. With nothing coming from the outside thanks to Georgetown's defense, the Pack began to go inside, leveraging the offensive rebound. With Sims and Lubick out, State pushed the ball inside and hit the boards, closing to 20-15 before the Hoyas got a three pointer from Jabril Trawick and a basket by Greg Whittington to go up 10, 25-15, with 5:07 remaining.}",
