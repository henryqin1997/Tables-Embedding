            "METHOD AND DEVICE FOR PROVIDING AUTOMATIC LOAD ALLEVIATION TO A HIGH LIFT SURFACE SYSTEM, IN PARTICULAR TO A LANDING FLAP SYSTEM, OF AN AIRCRAFT - A method and a device for providing automatic load alleviation to a high lift surface system, in particular to a landing flap system, of an aircraft when a blockage occurs, wherein in response to a control signal emitted by a control device at least one high lift surface, which is actuated by means of a local mechanical final control element, is brought to a predetermined position by a central drive unit that is connected by way of a rotary shaft arrangement to the local final control element by generating a torque transmitted by the central drive unit to the rotary shaft arrangement. If a signal is registered that indicates that there is a blockage within the high lift surface system, the torque transmitted by the central drive unit to the rotary shaft arrangement is automatically reduced to a predetermined low torque value, and the position of the high lift surface system is fixed.",

The light pipe may receive light having a first wavelength from the optical unit and direct the light having the first wavelength onto the exciter. The exciter may convert the light having the first wavelength into light having the second wavelength and reflects the light having the second wavelength to the reflector. A circumferential wall of the light pipe is configured to reflect the light having the first wavelength and to transmit the light having the second wavelength.</td> <td>20150043242</td> <tr> </tr> <td>11-13-2014</td> <td><a href=\"/patents/app/20140333901\">Phosphor Wheel and Illumination Device Comprising this Phosphor Wheel and a Pump Light Source</a> - The invention provides an illumination device comprising a pump light source and a phosphor wheel.
