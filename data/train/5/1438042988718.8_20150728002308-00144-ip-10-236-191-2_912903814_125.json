The OMB Control Number is 1219-0152., 319623=We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are announcing receipt of a proposed amendment to the Mississippi Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation (AMLR) Plan (hereinafter, the Mississippi Plan) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). Mississippi has requested concurrence from the Secretary of the Department of the Interior with its certification of completion of all coal-related reclamation objectives. If the Secretary concurs with the certification, Mississippi intends to request AMLR funds to pursue projects in accordance with section 411 of SMCRA. This document gives the times and locations that the Mississippi Plan and this proposed amendment to that plan are available for your inspection, the comment period during which you may submit written comments on the amendment, and the procedures that we will follow for the public hearing, if one is requested., 111368=Title 30 published on 2014-07-01, 314003=We are reopening the public comment period on a proposed amendment to the West Virginia permanent regulatory program under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). The proposed amendment consists of a Special Reclamation Tax Credit Rule that was submitted to OSMRE on August 7, 2014. The purpose of this document is to provide the public 15 additional days to comment on the proposed amendment., 172540=The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is requesting information on mine ventilation and roof control plans; atmospheric monitoring systems and new technology for remote monitoring systems; methods to suppress the propagation of coal dust explosions; and criteria and procedures for certification, recertification, and decertification of persons qualified to conduct mine examinations. These issues were raised in reports on the coal dust explosion that occurred at the Upper Big Branch Mine on April 5, 2010. After reviewing the recommendations in these reports and related National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health research, MSHA is seeking information and data that will help improve the health and safety of underground coal miners. Submitted information will assist MSHA in determining appropriate regulatory actions., 204218=The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register on January 6, 2015, (80 FR 608). ONRR invited the public to submit written comments by March 9, 2015. ONRR is granting a 60-day extension to the comment period in response to stakeholder requests., 74541=We are approving an amendment to the North Dakota regulatory program (the \u201cNorth Dakota program\u201d) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (\u201cSMCRA\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d). North Dakota intends to revise its program to be consistent with the corresponding Federal regulations. North Dakota submitted the amendment to address required rule changes OSMRE identified by letter to North Dakota dated October 2, 2009, under 30 CFR 732.17(c). These include changes to North Dakota's rules regarding use of the Applicant Violator System (AVS) and ownership and control. North Dakota has met all of the conditions outlined in the 732 letter and has included all applicable revisions and/or additions to their rules. North Dakota is also proposing to add a new subsection to an existing rule with general requirements relating to the format of electronic applications. They are also making a minor correction to another rule pertaining to the term of permits to make it consistent with a separate rule which was previously amended to no longer require renewal of a permit once lands in that permit are no longer being mined or used in the support of surface coal mining., 18424=We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE or OSM), are revising our abandoned mine land (AML) reclamation program regulations under Title IV of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). This rule allows states and Indian tribes that have certified completion of all known coal AML reclamation needs within their jurisdiction to receive limited liability protection for certain noncoal reclamation projects., 90482=We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are approving an amendment to the Texas regulatory program (Texas program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). Texas proposed revisions to its regulations regarding annual permit fees. Texas revised its program at its own initiative to raise revenues sufficient to cover its anticipated share of costs to administer the coal regulatory program and to encourage mining companies to more quickly reclaim lands and request bond release, thereby fulfilling SMCRA's purpose of assuring the reclamation of mined land as quickly as possible., 167656=We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are reopening the public comment period on the proposed amendment to the Kentucky regulatory program (the Kentucky program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act) that was originally published on February 20, 2013. The public comment period and opportunity for public hearing is being reopened to incorporate subsequent information (emergency regulations, permanent regulations, legislation, and revised statutes) that we received from Kentucky to address a deficiency in the Kentucky program regarding reclamation bonds and to revise its program to be administered in a manner consistent with SMCRA and the Federal regulations. This document gives the times and locations that this proposed amendment to the Kentucky program is available for your inspection, the comment period during which you may submit written comments on the amendment, and the procedures that we will follow for the public hearing, if one is requested., 247363=We are announcing the receipt of revisions pertaining to a previously proposed amendment to the Colorado regulatory program (hereinafter, the \u201cColorado program\u201d) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (\u201cSMCRA\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d). Colorado proposes additions of rules and revisions to Rules of the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Board for Coal Mining, 2 CCR 407-2, concerning the protection and replacement of the hydrologic balance, subsidence, valid existing rights determinations, roads, requirements associated with annual reclamation reports, prime farmland determinations, various definitions, permit revisions, performance bonds, backfill placement methods and requirements, backfilling and grading, and revegetation. Colorado intends to revise its program to improve operational efficiency. This document gives the times and locations that the Colorado program and proposed amendment to that program are available for your inspection, the comment period during which you may submit written comments on the amendment, and the procedures that we will follow for the public hearing, if one is requested., 212965=This document corrects \u00a7 100.3(e) in a proposed rule published in the Federal Register on July 31, 2014, regarding criteria and procedures for assessment of civil penalties. This correction also clarifies selected proposed provisions in the preamble to facilitate public understanding and to obtain more useful responses., 304383=BSEE is extending the public comment period on the ANPR on Helideck and Aviation Fuel Safety for Fixed Offshore Facilities, which was published in the Federal Register on September 24, 2014 (79 FR 57008). The original public comment period would end on November 24, 2014. However, BSEE has received a request from an offshore oil and gas industry association to extend the comment period. The BSEE has reviewed the extension request and determined that a 30-day comment period extension\u2014to December 24, 2014\u2014is appropriate., 52667=We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE or OSM), are amending our regulations concerning stream buffer zones, stream-channel diversions, excess spoil, and coal mine waste to comply with an order issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 20, 2014, which vacated the stream buffer zone rule that we published December 12, 2008. The court remanded the matter to us for further proceedings consistent with the decision. In relevant part, the Memorandum Decision stated that vacatur of the 2008 stream buffer zone rule resulted in reinstatement of the regulations in effect before the vacated rule took effect. Therefore, the rule that we are publishing today removes the provisions of the vacated 2008 rule and reinstates the corresponding regulations in effect before the effective date of the 2008 rule (January 12, 2009)., 13126=We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are approving an amendment to the Mississippi Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Plan (hereinafter, the Mississippi Plan) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). Mississippi requested concurrence from the Secretary of the Department of the Interior with its certification of completion of all coal-related reclamation objectives. Mississippi intends to request Abandoned Mine Land (AML) Reclamation funds to pursue projects in accordance with section 411 of SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1240a., 137101=BOEM and BSEE are extending the public comment period on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking entitled, \u201cOil and Gas and Sulphur Operations on the Outer Continental Shelf\u2014Requirements for Exploratory Drilling on the Arctic Outer Continental Shelf,\u201d which was published in the Federal Register on February 24, 2015, (80 FR 9916). The original public comment period would have ended on April 27, 2015. However, BOEM and BSEE have received public comments requesting an extension of the comment period. BOEM and BSEE have reviewed the extension requests and determined that a 30-day comment period extension to May 27, 2015, is appropriate., 325329=We are announcing receipt of a proposed amendment to the Wyoming regulatory program (hereinafter, the \u201cWyoming program\u201d) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (\u201cSMCRA\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d). Wyoming proposes both revisions of and additions to its coal rules and regulations concerning valid existing rights and ownership and control, and revises a provision concerning periodic monitoring of blasting. Wyoming intends to revise its program to be consistent with the corresponding Federal regulations and SMCRA, clarify ambiguities, and improve operational efficiency. This document gives the times and locations that the Wyoming program and proposed amendment to that program are available for your inspection, the comment period during which you may submit written comments on the amendment, and the procedures that we will follow for the public hearing, if one is requested., 79802=The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) establishes a comprehensive regime for addressing the consequences of oil spills, ranging from spill response to compensation for damages to injured parties. Other than deepwater ports subject to the Deepwater Port Act of 1974, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is authorized to adjust the limit of liability in OPA for offshore facilities, including pipelines. This rule amends BOEM's regulations to add to the regulations on Oil Spill Financial Responsibility (OSFR) for offshore facilities in order to increase the limit of liability for damages caused by the responsible party for an offshore facility from which oil is discharged, or which poses the substantial threat of an oil discharge, as described in OPA. This rule adjusts the limit of liability to reflect the significant increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) that has taken place since 1990. It also establishes a methodology for BOEM to use to periodically adjust the OPA offshore facility limit of liability for inflation. BOEM is hereby increasing the limit of liability for damages under OPA from $75 million to $133.65 million., 116212=The BSEE is extending the public comment period on the Notice of proposed rulemaking entitled \u201cOil and Gas and Sulphur Operations on the Outer Continental Shelf\u2014Blowout Preventer Systems and Well Control,\u201d which was published in the Federal Register on April 17, 2015. The original public comment period would have ended on June 16, 2015. However, BSEE received requests from various stakeholders to extend the comment period. The BSEE reviewed the extension requests and determined that a 30-day comment period extension\u2014to July 16, 2015\u2014is appropriate., 344010=BOEM has recognized the need to develop a comprehensive program to assist in identifying, prioritizing, and managing the risks associated with industry activities on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). BOEM intends to design and implement a more robust and comprehensive risk management, financial assurance and loss prevention program to address the complex issues and cost differences associated with offshore operations. As part of its overall effort to establish this program and associated changes to regulations, BOEM is seeking stakeholder comments regarding various risk management and monitoring activities pertaining to financial risks to taxpayers that may result from activities on the OCS. BOEM currently requires lessees to provide performance bonds and/or one of various alternative forms of financial assurance to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of leases, Rights-of-Use and Easements and Pipeline Rights-of-Way. BOEM is seeking comments on who is best suited to mitigate risks and whether other forms of financial assurance should be used, as well as whether, or to what extent, the current forms of financial assurance are adequate and appropriate. BOEM has received comments to its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) indicating that the number of issues being addressed and the complexity of the topics being considered would justify a longer comment period. Various groups have also requested that additional time be provided to review and analyze the ANPR. For these reasons, BOEM has agreed to extend the comment period by an additional 30 days. The new comment period will elapse 90 days from August 19, 2014, the date of the original of publication of the ANPR.}",
