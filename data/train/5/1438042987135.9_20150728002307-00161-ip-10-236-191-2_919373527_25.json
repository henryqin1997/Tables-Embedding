J, 12654=OSHA deleted the saccharin solution aerosol qualitative fit test protocol from the Cadmium final rule based upon a misreading of a comment submitted by the Maryland Occupational Safety and Health Administration (MOSH). The comment suggested the deletion of a reference to disposable dust respirators from the saccharin solution protocol in page 4131 Appendix C of the proposed Cadmium standard, 55 FR 4052 (February 6, 1990), since the standard prohibited the use of such respirators unless equipped with high efficiency filters. MOSH deemed the deletion to be necessary to avoid confusion. OSHA mistakenly deleted the entire protocol instead of only eliminating the reference to disposable dust respirators from the saccharin solution protocol. OSHA is correcting the preamble to the final rule and Appendix C by reinstating the deleted protocol and eliminating the reference to disposable dust respirators from the saccharin solution protocol to accurately reflect MOSH's comment, 85100=155.

The performance of participating laboratories over a concentration range of 1.5-12 ug/l was reported by Lind et al. (1987). Of the 3 QC runs conducted during 1982 and 1983, 1 or 2 of the 6 laboratories failed each run.

Elevated B(2)MU levels are among the signs used to define the onset of kidney dysfunction. Without access to the raw data from the studies listed in Table 9, it is necessary to rely on reported standard deviations to estimate an upper limit for normal B(2)MU concentrations (i.e., the upper 95th percentile for the distributions measured). For the 8 studies reporting a geometric standard deviation, the upper 95th percentiles for the distributions are 180-1140 ug/g CRTU. These values are in general agreement with the upper 95th percentile for the distribution (i.e., 631 ug/g CRTU) reported by Buchet et al. (1980). These upper limits also appear to be in general agreement with B(2)MU values (i.e., 100-690 ug/g CRTU) reported as the normal upper limit by Iwao et al. (1980), Kawada et al. (1989), Wibowo et al.

It is unclear at this point the extent to which collection procedures contribute to variability among CDB samples. Sources of variation that may result from sampling procedures include time-of-day effects and introduction of external contamination during the collection process. To minimize these sources, strict adherence to a sample collection protocol is recommended. Such a protocol must include provisions for thorough cleaning of the site from which blood will be extracted; also, every effort should be made to collect samples near the same time of day.
