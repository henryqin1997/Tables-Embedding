    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students UD embraces many different types of students, but most share a love of learning. If you are - curious - want to learn about more than just your major through the Core Curriculum - want to spend a semester abroad in Italy - are a Catholic looking for a supportive, moral environment - want a small school with small class sizes - love a good challenge, then you should definitely consider the University of Dallas. UD has very strong Biology, Theology, and Philosophy programs, and is a good choice for those who would like to go on to law or medical school. It\u2019s also a very good place for science majors who want a liberal arts education while still learning the technical information required by their chosen field. Tips for prospective students If you're a prospective student, the best thing you can do is visit the campus. It's what convinced me to attend UD, and I know many other students who had a similar experience. If you do attend UD, then DO: - Go to Rome. UD has a campus in Due Santi (just outside Rome), and students often attend school in Italy for an entire semester during the Sophomore or Junior year. More information about the program can be found here: http://www.udallas.edu/aboutus/offices/advancement/giving/givingopportunities/rome - Visit Campus Ministry. The people there are the most quirky/interesting/goodhearted people you will meet, and",
