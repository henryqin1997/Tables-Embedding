            "Coming from the city I don't advise human beings to go out alone after dark, ever. Except here, in the miniature city of Mount Vernon, where I feel incredibly safe. That doesn't mean that stupid colleges students don't make stupid decisions and don't do the wrong thing some time but overall campus is a pretty safe place.",
            "I have a number of friends involved with Greek life here at Cornell. Our system here is somewhat different than other schools since none of our Greek groups are affiliated with the national system. This means it's considerably less expensive, and because we're such a small school the group sizes range from about seven people up to nearly 60. (And even if you don't pledge, pre-pledge season is a great time to meet new people)",
            "I'm involved with the Mock Trial program, which is highly competitive. I also dabble in some theater, mostly with costuming. Overall there are a lot of things one can participate in, and I don't think it's hard to find at least one activity you like.",
            "You have to be willing to work your butt off. You have to know how to prioritize your time. Lots of people try to say it's for the student who doesn't procrastinate but I don't know a human being who doesn't procrastinate. You just have to manage your time, that includes your procrastination, well enough that it doesn't bite you in the butt, and it will do that a lot faster on the OCAAT.",
            "Ink pond isn't incredibly unusual but it's pretty and there's a hammock and a (swinging?) bench by it.",
            "This institution does give a good overall value. The classes are set up for you to learn, and the unique calendar works well for a number of students. There are also a number of opportunities on and off campus. The one draw back for me is that I wish there were more dance opportunities.",
            "There are a number of organizations you can be part of. PAAC puts on different events, such as comedians and musicians, throughout the year, usually including one bigger name group. There's also an adorable downtown for a bit of shopping, and there's a disc golf course on campus. There's usually one or two parties each weekend as well which can be fun depending on who's hosting.",
            "The food has greatly improved since the time I visited last year. My main problem is that at times Bon Apetit seems to try too hard, I think it would be better if they stuck to more basics and gave the option of variety to the students.",
            "The facilities themselves for first years are not the most glamourous but being on a floor of random freshman girls I was able to find a good group of friends, and the community within the particular coed building where I live is great.",
            "The courses are difficult. I have worked so hard this past year. You tend to have what you may consider to be around three nights worth of homework in one night. Often lengthy essays are expected to be written in a relatively short amount of time. The professors have high expectations for any kind of work, but they don't tend to baby you. It's up to you to take care of all your work and communicate with your professor if you think that's going to be a problem.",
            "Think about what your priorities are on a college campus, particularly concerning non academic priorities since those have an unexpected effect on your college success.",
            "I really enjoy my time in class and the small campus has given me a chance to make a network of friends quickly. The courses are incredibly rigorous and intellectually stimulating, and most of my professors have been reasonable human beings who I can talk to if need be."

According to the timeline, everything is supposed to be finished by the end of the fall semester of 2013, however, gauging from the lack of progress made in the past couple of years, construction will not be finished until 2015. Learn how to study. The block plan is stressful, and if you don't know how to manage your time, you will not succeed., 81164=They have a really nice bonfire and fireworks display during football homecoming. It is better than the July 4th display in my city., 84227=It is a small campus with about 2000 students which makes it more personal than larger universities. The blocks are 3 1/2 weeks which is a great deal of material in a short amount of time. Overall, I like the school and what they have to offer., 26881=This was the first year (2012-2013) for a new catering company called Bon Appetit. The caterer used in the past, Sodexo, was horrible. Remember that when you're reading old reviews! The new system is delicious! They have a great selection that is constantly changing. They even have a vegetarian and vegan area. Everyday there is a main serving area with pastas, meat, vegetables dishes and even an in house carvery. But there are also global food, sandwich and salad stations in the cafeteria. Oh, and the desserts are to DIE for., 82473=They are getting a new vendor this year(2012-2013) so I don't know how to rate the food. The current vendor isn't bad but when you eat each and every meal at the dining hall it can be boring after a while., 140625=Food in the Thomas Commons, the only place for dining, is alright. By the end of 2013 calendar year, the Commons will have been fully renovated, offering more opportunities at good food. And the firm that does the cooking, Bon Appetit, is pretty good at what they do., 150563=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

There is always something academic going on, from the many guest lecturers and visiting professors to class field trips. I can focus fully on one subject at a time and not have to worry about having two papers due on the same day for different classes!
