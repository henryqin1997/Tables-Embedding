    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6120=In order to avoid thioether bond in the conjugate, homofunctional crosslinker containing two NHS esters was used instead to prepare the conjugates. The crosslinker used was DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate). In order to prevent the formation of crosslinked Os mediator, i.e. Os-crosslinker-Os, a large excess of homofunctional crosslinker was used in the reaction with Os histamine at 4:1 molar ratio. Under this condition, only the desired product, i.e. Os-crosslinker, was formed. The Os-DSG-Alc conjugate was similarly prepared using the procedure described earlier.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{196047=Potassium hexachloroosmium was reacted with 4,4\u2032-dimethyl-2,2\u2032-dipyridyl at 1:2 molar ratio by refluxing in DMF. The potassium chloride preparative was filtered and the dimethyl-bipyridyl dichloroosmium complex was reduced from+3 oxidation state to+2 oxidation state using excess sodium dithionite. The product was recrystallized in DMF/water mixture at 0\ufffd C. and recovered by filtration., 149159=In the case of heterofunctional crosslinker, the crosslinker is first reacted with Os mediator with histamine ligand (Os histamine) at 1:1 molar ratio. One particular point needs to be noted here. Os mediator in oxidized form, i.e. Os(III), can instantly oxidize sulfhydryl group to form disulfide bond. It is importnat to keep Os center in the reduced form by addition of a small amount of reductant such as sodium dithionite during the conjugation processes. The reaction progress can be monitored by analytical reverse-phase HPLC on a C 18 column. Then the Os mediator-crosslinker adduct is isolated via preparative HPLC and the collected fraction is subsequently freeze-dried. Finally, the Os mediator-crosslinker adduct is reacted with the appropriate peptide to form Os mediator-peptide conjugate. Again, the product is isolated by collecting appropriate fraction in preparative HPLC and the collected fraction is then freeze-dried., 68745=This application claims benefit of provisional application 60/087,576 Jun. 1, 1998., 139372=2. Reversible mediators are selected from those described herein and those described references (U.S. Pat. Nos.4,945,045 and 5,589,325, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference). Preferably two different mediators are selected with potentials which differ by at least 100 mV, more preferably at least 200 mV. Examples of suitable mediators include the Os(bipy)ImCl described herein and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,589,326, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, and ferrocene, described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,945,045 and EP 0142301, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Mixtures of these mediators are made in aqueous solution, for example phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Concentrations between about 1 uM and 1000 uM may conveniently be measured., 220070=Several technologies are available for the measurement of glycated hemoglobin. They include immunoassays for HbAlc (TinaQuant, BMC; DCA2000, Ames; and Unimate, Roche), icon exchange (Variant, BioRad; Eagle Diagnostics), and affinity chromatography (ColumrMate, Helena; GlyHb, Pierce).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While these feasibility studies for a HbAlc immunoassay used an enzyme mediated amplification method (Glucdor/PQQ/glucose was used to regenerate reduced mediator after oxidation at the electrode surface providing a higher diffusion controlled current is given by the cottrell equation), they are considered to be indicative of results attainable with the use of IDA electrodes with bipotentiostatic control is most preferred for measuring mediator labeled conjugates in accordance with this invention. shows the reversal curves for the three antibodies. FIG. 10 For demonstrating inhibition reversal, antibody concentrations of 4 \u03bcM for both PAB IS and MAB and 15 \u03bcM for PAB DE were chosen from the inhibition curves shown above. Reversal curves were then generated using a series of dilutions ofBAS-Alc-polyhaptan with a\u22121:1 Alc:BAS. The BAS-Alc acts as our sample and binds to the antibody. Inhibition curves were also performed for the Os-SMCC-Alc (Max=97%) and OS-SATA-Als (Max=44%) mediator labels. Stability of the mediator labels were also evaluated by monitoring % inhibition values over time. All of the mediator labels showed some degradation when stored in dilute solutions (40 \u03bcM) at RT. Samplers frozen at\u221220\ufffd C. appear to be stable. shows the inhibition curves for each of the HbAlc antibodies tested. From the inhibition curves we were able to select reasonable concentrations of antibody for maximum reversal with Alc samples. FIG. 6 Polyclonal DE (ion-exchange) purified sheep antibody",
