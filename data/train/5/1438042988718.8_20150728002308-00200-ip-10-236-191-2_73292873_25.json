When you adjust the account ranges, 01.000.1000.000/ 03.000.1000.000 and 01.000.2000.000/03.000.2000.000 for inflation, you get the journal entries shown in these tables:, 43101=The Inflation Adjustment Date (Fecha Valor) feature lets you adjust a journal entry for a period that is before the effective date. For example, you can enter a journal entry for June and adjust the journal entry for a period that starts in January., 19888=Note: If the date of a journal entry belongs to more than one period, the Journal Import process assigns the journal entry to the earliest period that includes the date. For example, assume that the date December 31 belongs both to the December period (period number 12) and the Adjusting period (period number 13). In this case, the Journal Import process assigns all journal entries dated December 31 to the December period. You can change the journal entry period when you review the journal entries before you run the posting process., 48897=Sometimes incidents such as printing errors cause a mismatch between the invoice transaction number and the number on the pre-numbered form. For example, you might print three invoices numbered 1003, 1004, and 1005 on forms with matching pre-printed numbers, but then discover that these pre-numbered forms are damaged and not usable. You will need to reprint these invoices using the next available pre-numbered forms, numbered 1006, 1007, and 1008. After you reprint the invoices, however, the invoice transaction numbers stored in Oracle Receivables and the numbers on the pre-numbered forms no longer match., 37345=Creates journal entries with adjustment amounts that show the effect of inflation on your General Ledger accounts. The effective date of the journal entries is the last day of the last period adjusted, regardless of the number of periods adjusted. For example, if you have a monthly calendar and you adjust from January to March, only one journal entry, effective on March 31, is created., 314615=For example, the report is run for January to December, 2001 and shows a ending balance of 400., 356617=Copyright \u00a9 2006, 2010, Oracle and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved., 314177=For example, the report is run for December, 2001 and shows the same asset current cost of 1000 and accumulated depreciation of 400., 313741=For example, the report is run for January to December, 2001 and shows an asset with beginning cost of 800 in January, addition of 200, and ending cost of 1000 in December.}",

Post the imported journals in the main ledger. The posting process updates the account balances in both the transaction currency and the ledger currency, if the transaction currency is not the same as the ledger currency. You can run inquiries or standard reports to check that the journal entries are correctly posted or to check how the account balances are adjusted.

Defining the Main Ledger You must define a main ledger to record your transactions in. If you use the adjusted-only option, you record your transactions in the same ledger where you will run the inflation adjustment process. Note: If you use the Inflation Adjustment Date feature with the adjusted-only option, define your main ledger as an MRC primary ledger. To use the Inflation Adjustment Date feature, you must define the ledger where you will run the inflation adjustment process as an MRC primary ledger, even if you do not use the MRC feature in Oracle General Ledger. You can classify a ledger as primary in the Reporting Currency Options tabbed region in the Ledger window. For more information, see Using the Inflation Adjustment Date. If you use the historical/adjusted option, record your day-to-day business transactions in the historical ledger. Do not adjust for inflation in this ledger. Instead, copy these transactions to the adjusted ledger to adjust the balances for inflation. Related Topics Defining Ledgers, Oracle General Ledger Implementation Guide 2.
