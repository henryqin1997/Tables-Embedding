The package arrived today much sooner than expected (only took three days to cross the pond). When I opened the box, I was thrilled. As describe, the parka and liner were in near un issued condition. In fact, they were spectacular! The Wolf fur on the detachable hood is awesome and really adds character to the parka. Please tell your refurbished they did one heck of a job. Finally, the advice you gave me regarding sizing was spot on and the parka fits exactly as desired.\", 20630=*** The Who acquired our Classic M-1951 fishtail parka complete with 'The Who' Q signage on the back and relevant patches for their US & UK Quadrophenia 2012 / 2013 tour. ***, 20276=We have two Quadrophenia parka options to choose from: 1.
