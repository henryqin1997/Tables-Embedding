And for what you're paying to go to school, you're getting a great education and making some great memories! Am enjoying being here Although Fayette is a small town, I've grown used to it. It's nice though because everyone pretty much knows everyone. They just opened a new student center which is great. This school will only keep expanding and getting better. Am learning a lot The classes here are great. There aren't usually a large number of students in each class, so students have more of an opportunity for one on one time with the teachers. The teachers, advisers and all the staff are always very helpful and are always willing to help.
