The main components of the SG 222 include at least one switch and at least one router. The ESMEs 202 transmit messages through an IP network 250 to the SMPP gateway 222. The SMPP gateway 222 comprises at least two routing servers, such as the Sun Microsystem Netra T 1400 Dual 440 MHz processor servers with 1 GB memory and two 18 GB disks. The SG 222 is scalable from 2 to n routing nodes 264 1\u2013264 n. Other more current computer servers may also be used and are contemplated as within the scope of the invention. Other features such as slots for removable media devices and other standard equipment are well known to those of skill in the art.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the above description may contain specific details, they should not be construed as limiting the claims in any way. Other configurations of the described embodiments of the invention are part of the scope of this invention. For example, the above description discusses messages being passed between an ESME and a wireless device. However, the SG may be modified to route messages between wireless carriers. Thus, messages may be passed from a subscriber of one wireless carrier to a subscriber of another carrier for both MO and MT messages. Accordingly, the appended claims and their legal equivalents should only define the invention, rather than any specific examples given. The servers control at least one and preferrably two Cisco Local Director Routers 252, 254 as switches. Preferrably, TCP/IP is the networking protocol to provide communication across the diverse networks. Each switch 252, 254 preferrably contains a primary 256, 260 and a secondary 258, 262 component, respectively, for controlling the destination of each message received from the IP network 250. The destination of each message from the primary 256, 260 or secondary 258, 262 components of the switches 252, 254 is a first routing node 264 1 or a second routing node 264 2, up to \u201cn\u201d routing nodes. These routers are preferrably Cisco Local Director Routers comprising LocalDirector 420, a four port 10/100 Ethernet card in a rack-mounted arrangement. The routers 264 1, 264 2",
