    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Its a great place for students who is alright with having to travel on an airplane in order to get to college if you are from the mainland and you must get used to not being able to drive for long periods of time because you are on an island. Also you must enjoy the sunshine and warm weather year-round. This is also a great place for students who wants to learn many different languages because UH offers many different foreign languages that you probably wouldnt be able to learn at a college on the mainland. Tips for prospective students Be ready for a different demographic of students with many students of Asian and Pacific Islander decent. Some of the classes can be difficult and some of the professors can be hard to understand because of accents, but if you have tutors or form study groups with other students in the class, then you will be ok. Am enjoying being here The people in Hawaii are very friendly. Many of the professors are really helpful and want you to succeed in their classroom. Obviously, being in Hawaii year-round is going to a great place to spend your time and there is much to be explored here. Am",
