    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6263=In a preferred embodiment, the computational processing includes one or more Dead-End Elimination (DEE) computational steps. The DEE theorem is the basis for a very fast discrete search program that was designed to pack protein side chains on a fixed backbone with a known sequence. See Desmet. et al., Nature 356:539-542 (1992); Desmet, et al., The Protein Folding Problem and Tertiary Structure Prediction, Ch. 10:1-49 (1994); Goldstein, Biophys. Jour. 66:1335-1340 (1994), all of which are incorporated herein by reference. DEE is based on the observation that if a rotamer can be eliminated from consideration at a particular position, i.e. make a determination that a particular rotamer is definitely not part of the global optimal conformation, the size of the search is reduced. This is done by comparing the worst interaction (i.e. energy or Etotal) of a first rotamer at a single variable position with the best interaction of a second rotamer at the same variable position. If the worst interaction of the first rotamer is still better than the best interaction of the second rotamer, then the second rotamer cannot possibly be in the optimal conformation of the sequence. The original DEE theorem is shown in Equation 18: E \ue8a0 ( ia ) + \u2003 \ue89e \u2003 _ _ \ue89e \u2003 \ue89e [ min \ue89e \u2003 \ue89e over \ue89e \u2003 \ue89e t \ue89e { E \ue8a0 ( ia , jt ) } ] j > E \ue8a0 ( ib ) + \u2003 \ue89e \u2003 _ _ \ue89e \u2003 \ue89e [ max \ue89e \u2003 \ue89e over \ue89e \u2003 \ue89e t \ue89e { E \ue8a0 ( ib , jt ) } ] j Equation \ue89e \u2003 \ue89e 18}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{369880=Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Samples were prepared in 90/10 H2O/D2O and 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 5.5. Spectra were acquired on a Varian Unityplus 600 MHz spectrometer at 25\ufffd C. Samples were approximately 1 mM, except for \u03b170 which had limited solubility (100 \u03bcM). For hydrogen exchange studies, an NMR sample was prepared, the pH was adjusted to 5.5 and a spectrum was acquired to serve as an unexchanged reference. This sample was lyophilized, reconstituted in D2O and repetitive acquisition of spectra was begun immediately at a rate of 75 s per spectrum. Data acquisition continued for \u02dc20 hours, then the sample was heated to 99\ufffd C. for three minutes to fully exchange all protons. After cooling to 25\ufffd C., a final spectrum was acquired to serve as the fully exchanged reference. The areas of all exchangeable amide peaks were normalized by a set of non-exchanging aliphatic peaks, pH values, uncorrected for isotope effects, were measured for all the samples after data acquisition and the time axis was normalized to correct for minor differences in pH (Rohl, et al, Biochem. 31:1263 (1992))., 320513=Experimental characterization: The far UV circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of the designed molecule, pda8d, shows a maximum at 195 nm and minima at 218 nm and 208 nm, which is indicative of a folded structure. The thermal melt is weakly cooperative, with an inflection point at 39\ufffd C., and is completely reversible. The broad melt is consistent with a low enthalpy of folding which is expected for a motif with a small hydrophobic core. This behavior contrasts the uncooperative transitions observed for other short peptides (Weiss & Keutmann, 1990; Scholtz, et al., PNAS USA 88:2854 (1991); Struthers, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 118:3073 (1996b))., 103715=As is more fully described below, both of these methods can be done in a variety of ways. See Eisenberg et al., Nature 319:199-203 (1986); Connolly, Science 221:709-713 (1983); and Wodak, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77(4):1736-1740 (1980), all of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. As will be appreciated by those in the art, this salvation potential scoring function is conformation dependent, rather than conformation independent., 378314=A scoring function that penalizes the exposure of hydrophobic surface area might assist in the design of boundary residues. Dill and coworkers used an exposure penalty to improve protein designs in a theoretical study (Sun, et al., Protein Eng. 8(12)1205-1213 (1995))., 232882=A cydical design strategy was developed that couples theory, computation and experimental testing in order to address the problems of specificity and learning (FIG. 4). Our protein design automation (PDA) cycle is comprised of four components: a design paradigm, a simulation module, experimental testing and data analysis. The design paradigm is based on the concept of inverse folding (Pabo, Nature 301:200 (1983): Bowie, et al., Science 253:164-170 (1991)) and consists of the use of a fixed backbone onto which a sequence of side-chain rotamers can be placed, where rotamers are the allowed conformations of amino acid side chains (Ponder, et al., (1987) (supra)). Specific tertiary interactions based on the three dimensional juxtaposition of atoms are used to determine the sequences that will potentially best adopt the target fold. Given a backbone geometry and the possible rotamers allowed for each residue position as input, the simulation must generate as output a rank ordered list of solutions based on a cost function that explicitly considers the atom positions in the various rotamers. The principle obstacle is that a fixed backbone comprised of n residues and m possible rotamers per residue (all rotamers of all allowed amino acids) results in mn possible arrangements of the system, an immense number for even small design problems. For example, to consider 50 rotamers at 15 positions results in over 1025 sequences, which at an evaluation rate of 109 sequences per second (far beyond current capabilities) would take 109 years to exhaustively search for the global minimum. The synthesis and characterization of a subset of amino acid sequences presented by the simulation module generates experimental data for the analysis module. The analysis section discovers correlations between calculable properties of the simulated structures and the experimental observables. The goal of the analysis is to suggest quantitative modifications to the simulation and in some cases to the guiding design paradigm. In other words, the cost function used in the simulation module describes a theoretical potential energy surface whose horizontal axis comprises all possible solutions to the problem at hand. This potential energy surface is not guaranteed to match the actual potential energy surface which is determined from the experimental data. In this light, the goal of the analysis becomes the correction of the simulation cost function in order to create better agreement between the theoretical and actual potential energy surfaces. If such corrections can be found, then the output of subsequent simulations will be amino acid sequences that better achieve the target properties. This design cycle is generally applicable to any protein system and, by removing the subjective human component, allows a largely unbiased approach to protein design, i.e. protein design automation., 242667=The pairwise solvation potential was implemented in two components to remain consistent with the DEE methodology: rotamer/template and rotamer/rotamer burial. For the rotamer/template buried area, the reference state was defined as the rotamer in question at residue i with the backbone atoms only of residues i\u22121, i and i+1. The area of the side chain was calculated with the backbone atoms excluding solvent but not counted in the area. The folded state was defined as the area of the rotamer in question at residue i, but now in the context of the entire template structure including non-optimized side chains. The rotamer/template buried area is the difference between the reference and the folded states. The rotamer/rotamer reference area is simply the sum of the areas of the isolated rotamers. The folded state is the area of the two rotamers placed in their relative positions on the protein scaffold but with no template atoms present. The Richards definition of solvent accessible surface area (Lee & Richards, 1971, supra) was used, with a probe radius of 1.4 \u212b and Drieding van der Waals radii. Carbon and sulfur, and all attached hydrogens, were considered nonpolar. Nitrogen and oxygen, and all attached hydrogens, were considered polar. Surface areas were calculated with the Connolly algorithm using a dot density of 10 \u212b\u22122 (Connolly, (1983) (supra)). In more recent implementations of PDA_SETUP, the MSEED algorithm of Scheraga has been used in conjunction with the Connolly algorithm to speed up the calculation (Perrot, et al., J. Comput. Chem. 13:1-11 (1992))., 317213=In total, 20 out of 28 positions of the template were optimized during sequence selection. The algorithm first selects Gly for all positions with \u03b8 angles greater than 0\ufffd in order to minimize backbone strain (residues 9 and 27). The 18 remaining residues were split into two sets and optimized separately to speed the calculation. One set contained the 1 core, the 6 boundary positions and position 8 which resulted in 1.2\ufffd109 possible amino acid sequences corresponding to 4.3\ufffd1019 rotamer sequences. The other set contained the remaining 10 surface residues which had 1010 possible amino acid sequences and 4.1\ufffd1023 rotamer sequences. The two groups do not interact strongly with each other making their sequence optimizations mutually independent, though there are strong interactions within each group. Each optimization was carried out with the non-optimized positions in the template set to the crystallographic coordinates., 270283=Data analysis and design feedback A detailed analysis of the correspondence between the theoretical and experimental potential surfaces, and hence an estimate of the accuracy of the simulation cost function, was enabled by the collection of experimental data. Using thermal stability as a measure of design performance, melting temperatures of the PDA peptides were plotted against the sequence scores found in the Monte Carlo search (FIG. 6). The modest correlation, 0.67, in the plot shows that while an exclusively van der Waals scoring function can screen for stable sequences, it does not accurately predict relative stabilities. In order to address this issue, correlations between calculated structural properties and Tm's were systematically examined using quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR), which is a statistical technique commonly used in structure based drug design (Hopfinger, J. Med. Chem. 28:1133 (1985))., 525100=A synthetic G\u03b21 gene (Minor & Kim, 1994) was cloned into pET11a (Novagen) and used as the template for inverse PCR mutagenesis (Hemsley et al., 1989). 5\u2032 phosphorylated oligos (Genosys) were used without further purification. Mutant sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The expression and purification of the mutant proteins followed published procedures (Minor & Kim, 1994). Incomplete N-terminal processing resulted in a mixture of 56 and 57 residue proteins which were separated by HPLC (Minor & Kim, 1994, supra). The 57 residue proteins were used in all cases except for mutants \u0394h0.9[\u22121.50 \u212b] and \u0394h0.9[+1.50 \u212b], where the 56 residue proteins were used. Molecular weights were confirmed by mass spectrometry., 104214=In a preferred embodiment, the pairwise solvation potential is implemented in two components, \u201csingles\u201d (rotamer/template) and \u201cdoubles\u201d (rotamer/rotamer), as is more fully described below. For the rotamer/template buried area, the reference state is defined as the rotamer in question at residue position i with the backbone atoms only of residues i\u22121, i and i+1, although in some instances just i may be used. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the solvation potential is not calculated for the interaction of each backbone atom with a particular rotamer, although more may be done as required. The area of the side chain is calculated with the backbone atoms excluding solvent but not counted in the area. The folded state is defined as the area of the rotamer in question at residue i, but now in the context of the entire template structure including non-optimized side chains, i.e. every other foxed position residue. The rotamer/template buried area is the difference between the reference and the folded states. The rotamer/rotamer reference area can be done in two ways; one by using simply the sum of the areas of the isolated rotamers; the second includes the full backbone. The folded state is the area of the two rotamers placed in their relative positions on the protein scaffold but with no template atoms present. In a preferred embodiment, the Richards definition of solvent accessible surface area (Lee and Richards, J. Mol. Biol. 55:379-400,1971, hereby incorporated by reference) is used, with a probe radius ranging from 0.8 to 1.6 \u212b, with 1.4 \u212b being preferred, and Drieding van der Waals radii, scaled from 0.8 to 1.0. Carbon and sulfur, and all attached hydrogens, are considered nonpolar. Nitrogen and oxygen, and all attached hydrogens, are considered polar. Surface areas are calculated with the Connolly algorithm using a dot density of 10 \u212b-2 (Connolly, (1983)(supra), hereby incorporated by reference)., 322484=The NMR chemical shifts of pda8d are well dispersed, suggesting that the protein is folded and well-ordered. The H\u03b1-HN fingerprint region of the TOCSY spectrum is well-resolved with no overlapping resonances (FIG. (9A) and all of the H\u03b1 and HN resonances have been assigned. NMR data were collected on a Varian Unityplus 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a Nalorac inverse probe with a self-shielded z-gradient. NMR samples were prepared in 90/10 H2O/D2O or 99.9% D2O with 50 mM sodium phosphate at pH 5.0. Sample pH was adjusted using a glass electrode with no correction for the effect of D2O on measured pH. All spectra for assignments were collected at 7C. Sample concentration was approximately 2 mM. NMR assignments were based on standard homonuclear methods using DQF-COSY, NOESY and TOCSY spectra (Wuthrich, NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids (John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1986). NOESY and TOCSY spectra were acquired with 2K points in F2 and 512 increments in F1 and DQF-COSY spectra were acquired with 4K points in F2 and 1024 increments in F1. All spectra were acquired with a spectral width of 7500 Hz and 32 transients. NOESY spectra were recorded with mixing times of 100 and 200 ms and TOCSY spectra were recorded with an isotropic mixing time of 80 ms. In TOCSY and DQF-COSY spectra water suppression was achieved by presaturation during a relaxation delay of 1.5 and 2.0 s, respectively. Water suppression in the NOESY spectra was accomplished with the WATERGATE pulse sequence (Piotto. et al., 1992). Chemical shifts were referenced to the HOD resonance. Spectra were zero-filled in both F2 and F1 and apoedized with a shifted gaussian in F2 and a cosine bell in F1 (NOESY and TOCSY) or a 30\ufffd shifted sine bell in F2 and a shifted gaussian in F1 (DQF-COSY)., 248532=Optimizing the 16 a and d positions each with 238 possible hydrophobic rotamers results in 23816 or 1038 rotamer sequences. The DEE algorithm finds the global optimum in three minutes, including rotamer energy calculation time. The DEE solution matches the naturally occurring GCN4-p1 sequence of a and d residues for all of the 16 positions. A one million step Monte Carlo search run at a temperature of 1000 K generated the list of sequences rank ordered by their score. To test reproducibility, the search was repeated three times with different random number seeds and all trials provided essentially identical results. The second best sequence is a Val 30 to Ala mutation and lies three kcal/mol above the ground state sequence. Within the top 15 sequences up to six mutations from the ground state sequence are tolerated, indicating that a variety of packing arrangements are available even for a small coiled coil. Eight sequences with a range of stabilities were selected for experimental testing, including six from the top 15 and two more about 15 kcal/mol higher in energy, the 56th and 70th in the list (Table 1)., 221969=In a preferred embodiment, the computation processing need not comprise a DEE computational step. In this embodiment, a Monte Carlo search is undertaken, as is known in the art. See Metropolis et al., J. Chem. Phys. 21:1087 (1953), hereby incorporated by reference. In this embodiment, a random sequence comprising random rotamers is chosen as a start point. In one embodiment, the variable residue positions are classified as core, boundary or surface residues and the set of available residues at each position is thus defined. Then a random sequence is generated, and a random rotamer for each amino acid is chosen. This serves as the starting sequence of the Monte Carlo search. A Monte Carlo search then makes a random jump at one position, either to a different rotamer of the same amino acid or a rotamer of a different amino acid, and then a new sequence energy (Etotal sequence) is calculated, and if the new sequence energy meets the Boltzmann criteria for acceptance, it is used as the starting point for another jump. If the Boltzmann test fails, another random jump is attempted from the previous sequence. In this way, sequences with lower and lower energies are found, to generate a set of low energy sequences., 525942=CD spectra were measured on an Aviv 62DS spectrometer at pH 6.0, 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 25\ufffd C. and 50 \u03bcM protein. A 1 mm pathlength cell was used and the temperature was controlled by a thermoelectric unit. Thermal melts were performed in the same buffer using two degree temperature increments with an averaging time of 10 s and an equilibration time of 90s. Tm values were derived from the ellipticity at 218 nm ([\u03b8]218) by evaluating the maximum of a d[\u03b8]218/dT versus T plot. The Tm's were reproducible to within two degrees. Protein concentrations were determined by UV spectrophotometry. NMR samples were prepared in 90/10 H2O/D2O and 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 6.0. Spectra were acquired on a Varian Unity Plus 600 MHz spectrometer at 25\ufffd C. 1024 transients were acquired with 1.5 seconds of solvent presaturation used for water suppression. Samples were approximately 0.5 mM., 244283=Monte Carlo search: Following DEE optimization, a rank ordered list of sequences was generated by a Monte Carlo search in the neighborhood of the DEE solution. This list of sequences was necessary because of possible differences between the theoretical and actual potential surfaces. The Monte Carlo search starts at the global minimum sequence found by DEE. A residue was picked randomly and changed to a random rotamer selected from those allowed at that site. A new sequence energy was calculated and, if it met the Boltzman criteria for acceptance, the new sequence was used as the starting point for another jump. If the Boltzman test failed, then another random jump was attempted from the previous sequence. A list of the best sequences found and their energies was maintained throughout the search. Typically 106 jumps were made, 100 sequences saved and the temperature was set to 1000 K. After the search was over, all of the saved sequences were quenched by changing the temperature to 0 K, fixing the amino acid identity and trying every possible rotamer jump at every position. The search was implemented in a program called PDA_MONTE whose input was a global optimum solution from PDA_DEE and a list of rotamer energies from PDA_SETUP. The output was a list of the best sequences rank ordered by their score. PDA_SETUP, PDA_DEE and PDA_MONTE were implemented in the CERIUS2 software development environment (Biosym/Molecular Simulations, San Diego, Calif.)., 39774=FIG. 11 depicts the sequence of FSD-1 (SEQ ID NO:3) of Example 5 aligned with the second zinc finger of Zif268 (SEQ ID NO:1). The bar at the top of the figure shows the residue position classifications: solid bars indicate core positions, hatched bars indicate boundary positions and open bars indicate surface positions. The alignment matches positions of FSD-1 (SEQ ID NO:3) to the corresponding backbone template positions of Zif268 (SEQ ID NO:1). Of the six identical positions (21%) between FSD-1 (SEQ ID NO:3) and Zif268 (SEQ ID NO:1), four are buried (Ile7, Phe12, Leu18 and Ile22). The zinc binding residues of Zif268 are boxed. Representative non-optimal sequence solutions (SEQ ID NOS:4-22) determined using a Monte Carlo simulated annealing protocol are shown with their rank. Vertical lines indicate identity with FSD-1 (SEQ ID NO:3). The symbols at the bottom the figure show the degee of sequence conservation for each residue position computed across the top 1000 sequences: filled circles indicate greater than 99% conservation, half-filled circles indicate conservation between 90 and 99%, open circles indicate conservation between 50 and 90%, and the absence of symbol indicates less than 50% conservation. The consensus sequence determined by choosing the amino acid with the highest occurrence at each position is identical to the sequence of FSD-1 (SEQ ID NO:3)., 312583=The characterization of these peptides clearly shows that surface residues have a dramatic impact on the stability of \u03b1-helical coiled coils. The wide range of stabilities displayed by the different surface designs is notable, with greater than a 50\ufffd C. spread between the random hydrophilic sequence (Tm 15\ufffd C.) and the designed sequences (Tm 69-72\ufffd C.). This result is consistent with studies on other proteins that demonstrated the importance of solvent exposed residues (O'Neil & DeGrado, 1990: Zhang, et al., 1991, Minor, et a., (1994) (supra); Smith, et al., Science 270:980-982 (1995)). Further, these designs have significantly higher Tm's than the wildtype GCN4-p1 sequence, demonstrating that surface residues can be used to improve stability in protein design (O'shea, et al., supra). Though helix propensity appears to be more important than hydrogen bonding in stabilizing the designed coiled coils, hydrogen bonding could be important in the design and stabilization of other types of secondary structure., 285799=\u03bb repressor mutants: To demonstrate the generality of the cost function, other proteins were examined using the simulation module. A library of core mutants of the DNA binding protein \u03bb repressor has been extensively characterized by Sauer and coworkers (Lim & Sauer, J. Mol. Biol. 219:359(1991)). Template coordinates were taken from PDB file 1LMB (Beamer & Pabo, J. Mol. Biol. 227:177 (1992)). The subunit designated chain 4 in the PDB file was removed from the context of the rest of the structure (accompanying subunit and DNA) and using BIOGRAF explicit hydrogens were added. The hydrophobic residues with side chains within 5 \u212b of the three mutation sites (V36 M40 V47) are Y22, L31, A37, M42, L50, F51, L64, L65, I68 and L69. All of these residues are greater than 80% buried except for M42 which is 65% buried and L64 which is 45% buried. A37 only has one possible rotamer and hence was not optimized. The other nine residues in the 5 \u212b sphere were allowed to take any rotamer conformation of their amino acid (\u201cfloated\u201d). The mutation sites were allowed any rotamer of the amino acid sequence in question. Depending on the mutant sequence, 5\ufffd106 to 7\ufffd1018 conformations were possible. Rotamer energy and DEE calculation times were 2 to 4 minutes. The combined activity score is that of Hellinga and Richards (Hellinga, et al., (1994) (supra)). Seventy-eight of the 125 possible combinations were generated. Also, this dataset has been used to test several computational schemes and can serve as a basis for comparing different forcefields (Lee & Levitt, Nature 352:448 (1991); van Gunsteren & Mark, supra; Hellinga, et al., (1994) (supra)). The simulation module, using the cost function found by QSAR, was used to find the optimal conformation and energy for each mutant sequence. All hydrophobic residues within 5 \u212b of the three mutation sites were also left free to be relaxed by the algorithm. This 5 \u212b sphere contained 12 residues, a significantly larger problem than previous efforts (Lee & Levitt, supra; Hellinga, (1994) (supra)), that were rapidly optimized by the DEE component of the simulation module. The rank correlation of the predicted energy to the combined activity score proposed by Hellinga and Richards is shown in FIG. 7. The wildtype has the lowest energy of the 125 possible sequences and the correlation is essentially equivalent to previously published results which demonstrates that the QSAR corrected cost function is not specific for coiled coils and can model other proteins adequately., 225162=Once optimized protein sequences are identified, the processing of FIG. 2 optionally proceeds to step 56 which entails searching the protein sequences. This processing may be implemented with the search module 36. The search module 36 is a set of computer code that executes a search strategy. For example, the search module 36 may be written to execute a Monte Carlo search as described above. Starting with the global solution, random positions are changed to other rotamers allowed at the particular position, both rotamers from the same amino acid and rotamers from different amino acids. A new sequence energy (Etotal sequence) is calculated, and if the new sequence energy meets the Boltzmann criteria for acceptance, it is used as the starting point for another jump. See Metropolis et al., 1953, supra, hereby incorporated by reference. If the Boltzmann test fails, another random jump is attempted from the previous sequence. A list of the sequences and their energies is maintained during the search. After a predetermined number of jumps, the best scoring sequences may be output as a rank-ordered list. Preferably, at least about 106 jumps are made, with at least about 107 jumps being preferred and at least about 108 jumps being particularly preferred. Preferably, at least about 100 to 1000 sequences are saved, with at least about 10,000 sequences being preferred and at least about 100,000 to 1,000,000 sequences being especially preferred. During the search, the temperature is preferably set to 1000 K., 293390=Sequence design: Scoring functions and DEE: The protein structure was modeled on the backbone coordinates of GCN4-p1, PDB record 2zta (Bernstein, et al., supra; O'Shea, et al., supra). Atoms of all side chains not optimized were left in their crystallographically determined positions. The program BIOGRAF (Molecular Simulations Incorporated, San Diego, Calif.) was used to generate explicit hydrogens on the structure which was then conjugate gradient minimized for 50 steps using the DREIDING forcefield (Mayo, et al., 1990, supra). The symmetry of the dimer and lack of interactions of surface residues between the subunits allowed independent design of each subunit. All computations were done using the first monomer to appear in 2zta (chain A). A backbone-dependent rotamer library was used (Dunbrack, et al. (1993) (supra)). c3 angles that were undetermined from the database statistics were assigned the following values: Arg, \u221260\ufffd, 60\ufffd, and 180\ufffd; Gln, \u2212120\ufffd, \u221260\ufffd, 0\ufffd, 60\ufffd, 120\ufffd, and 180\ufffd; Glu, 0\ufffd, 60\ufffd, and 120\ufffd; Lys, \u221260\ufffd, 60\ufffd, and 180\ufffd. c4 angles that were undetermined from the database statistics were assigned the following values: Arg, \u2212120\ufffd, \u221260\ufffd, 60\ufffd, 120\ufffd, and 180\ufffd; Lys, 40\ufffd, 60\ufffd, and 180\ufffd. Rotamers with rotamers of c3 and c4 that resulted in sequential g+/g\u2212 or g\u2212/g+ angles were eliminated. Uncharged His rotamers were used. A Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential with van der Waals radii scaled by 0.9 (Dahiyat, et al., First fully automatic design of a protein achieved by Caltech scientists, new press release (1997) was used for van der Waals interactions. The hydrogen bond potential consisted of a distance-dependent term and an angle-dependent term, as depicted in Equation 9, above. This hydrogen bond potential is based on the potential used in DREIDING, with more restrictive angle-dependent terms to limit the occurrence of unfavorable hydrogen bond geometries. The angle term varies depending on the hybridization state of the donor and acceptor, as shown in Equations 10 to 13, above., 255680=Size exclusion chromatography: Size exclusion chromatography was performed with a Synchropak GPC 100 column (25 cm by 4.6 mm) at pH 7.0 in 50 mM phosphate and 150 mM NaCl at 0\ufffd C. GCN4-p1 and p-LI (Harbury, et al., Science 262:1401 (1993)) were used as size standards. 10 \u03bcl injections of 1 mM peptide solution were chromatographed at 0.20 ml/min and monitored at 275 nm. Peptide concentrations were approximately 60 \u03bcM as estimated from peak heights. Samples were run in triplicate., 444681=The optimal sequence, shown in FIG. 11, is called Full Sequence Design-1 (FSD-1) (SEQ ID NO:3). Even though all of the hydrophilic amino acids were considered at each of the boundary positions, the algorithm selected only nonpolar amino acids. The eight core and boundary positions are predicted to form a well-packed buried cluster. The Phe side chains selected by the algorithm at the zinc binding His positions of Zif268, positions 21 and 25, are over 80% buried and the Ala at position 5 is 100% buried while the Lys at position 8 is greater than 60% exposed to solvent. The other boundary positions demonstrate the strong steric constraints on buried residues by packing similar side chains in an arrangement similar to that of Zif268. The calculated optimal configuration for core and boundary residues buries \u02dc1150 \u212b2 of nonpolar surface area. On the helix surface, the program positions Asn 14 as a helix N-cap with a hydrogen bond between its side-chain carbonyl oxygen and the backbone amide proton of residue 16. The eight charged residues on the helix form three pairs of hydrogen bonds, though in our coiled coil designs helical surface hydrogen bonds appeared to be less important than the overall helix propensity of the sequence (Dahiyat, et al., Science (1997)). Positions 4 and 11 on the exposed sheet surface were selected to be Thr, one of the best \u03b2-sheet forming residues (Kim, et al. 1993)., 62177=As will be appreciated by those in the art, there are a wide variety of different supersecondary structure parameters that can be used.

Each candidate scoring function was used to design the b, c, and f positions of the model coiled coil and the resulting peptide was synthesized and characterized to assess design performance. A hydrogen-bond potential was used to check if predicted hydrogen bonds can contribute to designed protein stability, as expected from studies of hydrogen bonding in proteins and peptides (Stickle, et al., supra: Huyghues-Despointes, et al., supra). Optimizing sequences for hydrogen bonding, however, often buries polar protons that are not involved in hydrogen bonds. This uncompensated loss of potential hydrogen-bond donors to water prompted examination of a second scoring scheme consisting of a hydrogen-bond potential in conjunction with a penalty for burial of polar protons (Eisenberg, (1986) (supra)). We tested a third scoring scheme which augments the hydrogen bond potential with the empirically derived helix propensities of Baldwin and coworkers (Chakrabartty, et al., supra). Although the physical basis of helix propensities is unclear, they can have a significant effect on protein stability and can potentially be used to improve protein designs (O'Neil & DeGrado, 1990; Zhang, et al., Biochem. 30:2012 (1991); Blaber, et al., Science 260:1637 (1993); O'shea, et al., 1993; Villegas, et al., Folding and Design 1:29 (1996)). A van der Waals potential was used in all cases to account for packing interactions and excluded volume., 30374=De novo protein design has received considerable attention recently, and significant advances have been made toward the goal of producing stable, well-folded proteins with novel sequences. Efforts to design proteins rely on knowledge of the physical properties that determine protein structure, such as the patterns of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues in the sequence, salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, and secondary structural preferences of amino acids. Various approaches to apply these principles have been attempted. For example, the construction of \u03b1-helical and \u03b2-sheet proteins with native-like sequences was attempted by individually selecting the residue required at every position in the target fold (Hecht, et al., Science 249:884-891 (1990); Quinn, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 91:8747-8751 (1994)). Alternatively, a minimalist approach was used to design helical proteins, where the simplest possible sequence believed to be consistent with the folded structure was generated (Regan, et al., Science 241:976-978 (1988); DeGrado, et al., Science 243:622-628 (1989); Handel, et al., Science 261:879-885 (1993)), with varying degrees of success. An experimental method that relies on the hydrophobic and polar (HP) pattern of a sequence was developed where a library of sequences with the correct pattern for a four helix bundle was generated by random mutagenesis (Kamtekar, et al., Science 262:1680-1685 (1993)). Among non de novo approaches, domains of naturally occurring proteins have been modified or coupled together to achieve a desired tertiary organization (Pessi, et al., Nature 362:367-369 (1993); Pomerantz, et al., Science 267:93-96 (1995))., 65377=For the \u03b1/\u03b2 protein interactions, the helix center is defined as the average C\u03b1 position of the residues chosen for backbone movement. The helix axis is defined as the principal moment of the C\u03b1 atoms of these residues (see Chothia et al., 1981, supra). The strand axis is defined as the average of the least-squares lines fit through the midpoints of sequential C\u03b1 positions of the two central \u03b2-strands. The sheet plane is defined as the least-squares plane fit through the C\u03b1 positions of the two central \u03b2-strands. The sheet axis is defined as the vector perpendicular to the sheet plane that passes through the helix center. \u03a9 is the angle between the strand axis and the helix axis after projection onto the sheet plane; \u03b8 is the angle between the helix axis and the sheet plane; h is the distance between the helix center and the sheet plane; \u03c3 is the rotation angle about the helix axis. Backbone alteration requires altering at least one of these parameter values. In a preferred embodiment, the supersecondary structure parameter value \u03a9 is altered by changing the angle degree (either positively or negatively) of up to about 25 degrees, with changes of \ufffd1\ufffd, 2.5\ufffd, 5\ufffd, 7.5\ufffd, and 10\ufffd being particularly preferred. In a preferred embodiment, the supersecondary structure parameter value \u03b8 is altered by changing the angle degree (either positively or negatively) of up to about 25 degrees, with changes of \ufffd1\ufffd, 2.5\ufffd, 5\ufffd, 7.5\ufffd, and 10\ufffd being particularly preferred, the supersecondary structure parameter value \u03c3 is altered by changing the angle degree (either positively or negatively) of up to about 25 degrees, with changes of \ufffd1\ufffd, 2.5\ufffd, 5\ufffd, 7.5\ufffd, and 10\ufffd being particularly preferred. In a preferred embodiment, the supersecondary structure parameter value h is altered by changes (either positive or negative) of up to about 8\ufffd, with changes of \ufffd0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25 and 1.5 being particularly preferred. However, as will be appreciated by those in the art, as for all the parameter values outlined herein, larger changes can be made, depending on the protein (i.e. how close or far other secondary structure elements are) and whether other parameter values are made; for example, larger changes in \u03a9 can be made if the helix is also moved away from the sheet (i.e. h is increased)., 247042=Homodimeric coiled coils were modeled on the backbone coordinates of GCN4-p1, PDB ascension code 2ZTA (Bernstein, et al., J. Mol. Biol. 112:535 (1977); O'Shea, et al., supra). Atoms of all side chains not optimized were left in their crystallographically determined positions. The program BIOGRAF (Biosym/Molecular Simulations, San Diego, Calif.) was used to generate explicit hydrogens on the structure which was then conjugate gradient minimized for 50 steps using the Dreiding forcefield. The HP pattern was enforced by only allowing hydrophobic amino acids into the rotamer groups for the optimized a and d positions. The hydrophobic group consisted of Ala, Val, Leu, lie, Met, Phe, Tyr and Trp for a total of 238 rotamers per position. Homodimer symmetry was enforced by penalizing by 100 kcal/mol rotamer pairs that violate sequence symmetry. Different rotamers of the same amino acid were allowed at symmetry related positions. The asparagine that occupies the a position at residue 16 was left in the template and not optimized. A 106 step Monte Carlo search run at a temperature of 1000 K generated the list of candidate sequences rank ordered by their score. To test reproducibility, the search was repeated three times with different random number seeds and all trials provided essentially identical results. The Monte Carlo searches took about 90 minutes. All calculations in this work were performed on a Silicon Graphics 200 MHz R4400 processor., 221079=In a preferred embodiment, the various DEE steps are run until a managable number of sequences is found, i.e. no further processing is required. These sequences represent a set of optimized protein sequences, and they can be evaluated as is more fully described below. Generally, for computational purposes, a manageable number of sequences depends on the length of the sequence, but generally ranges from about 1 to about 1015 possible rotamer sequences., 446132=FIG. 11 shows the alignment of the sequences for FSD-1 (SEQ ID NO:3) and Zif268 (SEQ ID NO:1). Only 6 of the 28 residues (21%) are identical and only 11 (39%) are similar. Four of the identities are in the buried cluster, which is consistent with the expectation that buried residues are more conserved than solvent exposed residues for a given motif (Bowie, et al., Science 247:1306-1310 (1990)). A BLAST (Altschul, et al., supra) search of the FSD-1 sequence (SEQ ID NO:3) against the non-redundant protein sequence database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information did not find any zinc finger protein sequences. Further, the BLAST search found only low identity matches of weak statistical significance to fragments of various unrelated proteins. The highest identity matches were 10 residues (36%) with p values ranging from 0.63-1.0. Random 28 residue sequences that consist of amino acids allowed in the \u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 position classification described above produced similar BLAST search results, with 10 or 11 residue identities (36-39%) and p values ranging from 0.35-1.0, further suggesting that the matches found for FSD-1 are statistically insignificant. The very low identity to any known protein sequence demonstrates the novelty of the FSD-1 sequence (SEQ ID NO:3) and underscores that no sequence information from any protein motif was used in our sequence scoring function., 443191=The total number of amino acid sequences that must be considered by the design algorithm is the product of the number of possible amino acid types at each residue position. The \u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 motif residue classification described above results in a virtual combinatorial library of 1.9\ufffd1027 possible amino acid sequences (one core position with 7 possible amino acids, 7 boundary positions with 16 possible amino acids, 18 surface positions with 10 possible amino acids and 2 positions with \u03c6 angles greater than 0\ufffd each with 1 possible amino acid). A corresponding peptide library consisting of only a single molecule for each 28 residue sequence would have a mass of 11.6 metric tons. In order to accurately model the geometric specificity of side-chain placement, we explicitly consider the torsional flexibility of amino acid side chains in our sequence scoring by representing each amino acid with a discrete set of allowed conformations, called rotamers. As above, a backbone dependent rotatmer library was used (Dunbrack and Karplus, supra), with adjustments in the \u03c71 and \u03c72 angles of hydrophobic residues. As a result, the design algorithm must consider all rotamers for each possible amino acid at each residue position. The total size of the search space for the \u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 motif is therefore 1.1\ufffd1062 possible rotamer sequences. The rotamer optimization problem for the \u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 motif required 90 CPU hours to find the optimal sequence., 337145=An ideal model system to study core packing is the \u03b21 immunoglobulin-binding domain of streptococcal protein G (G\u03b21) (Gronenborn, et al., Science 253:657 (1991); Alexander, et al., Biochem. 31: 3597 (1992); Barchi, et al., Protein Sci. 3:15 (1994); Gallagher, et al., 1994; Kuszewski, et al., 1994; Orban, et al., 1995). Its small size, 56 residues, renders computations and experiments tractable. Perhaps most critical for a core packing study, G\u03b21 contains no disulfide bonds and does not require a cofactor or metal ion to fold. Further, G\u03b21 contains sheet, helix and turn structures and is without the repetitive side-chain packing patterns found in coiled coils or some helical bundles. This lack of periodicity reduces the bias from a particular secondary or tertiary structure and necessitates the use of an objective side-chain selection program to examine packing effects., 522749=The initial G\u03b21 structure was taken from PDB entry 1 pga (Bernstein et al., J. Mol Biol 112:535-542 (1977) \u201cThe Protein Data Bank: A computer-based archival file for macromolecular structures\u201d); Gallagher et al., 1994 (id). The program BIOGRAF (Molecular Simulations Incorporated, San Diego, Calif.) was used to generate explicit hydrogens on the structure which was then conjugate gradient minimized for 50 steps using the DREIDING forcefield (Mayo et al., 1990 (id)). The coordinate positions of atoms not involved in core sequence selection or backbone perturbations were kept fixed. Concerted backbone movements were performed by repositioning the \u03b1-helix (residues 23 through 36) to reflect the desired change in the indicated super-secondary structure parameter value. The coordinate positions of atoms belonging to residues 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 35 and 36 were kept fixed after repositioning the helix. The distorted peptide bonds that result from backbone perturbations were left unchanged. The \u0394h, \u0394\u03a9 and \u0394\u03b1-series perturbations were carried out by translating the helix along the sheet axis, rotating the helix about the sheet axis and rotating the helix about the vector parallel to the helix axis that passes through the helix center, respectively (see FIG. 14). The \u0394\u03b8-series perturbations were carried out by rotating the helix about the vector resulting from the cross product of the sheet axis and the vector parallel to the helix axis that passes through the helix center. A Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential was used for van der Waals interactions with atomic radii scaled by either 1.0 or 0.9 as indicated (Dahiyat & Mayo, submitted). The Richards definition of solvent-accessible surface area (Lee & Richards, 1971, supra) was used and areas were calculated with the Connolly algorithm (Connolly, 1983, supra). An atomic solvation parameter of 23.2 cal/mol/\u212b2 was used to favor hydrophobic burial (Dahiyat & Mayo, 1996, supra). The rotamer library and DEE optimization followed the methods of our previous work (Dahiyat & Mayo, 1996, supra). Calculations were performed on either a 12 processor, R10000-based Silicon Graphics Power Challenge or a 512 node Intel Delta., 519516=This example is concerned primarily with coupling backbone flexibility and the selection of amino acids for protein cores and an assessment of the tolerance of our side-chain selection algorithm to perturbations in protein backbone geometry. An ideal model system for these purposes is the \u03b21 immunoglobulin-binding domain of streptococcal protein G (G\u03b21) (Gronenborn et al., Science 253:657-661(1991 \u201cA novel, highly stable fold of the immunoglobulin binding domain of streptococcal protein G\u201d). Its small size, 56 residues, renders computations more tractable and simplifies production of the protein by either synthetic or recombinant methods. A solution structure (Gronenborn et al., id) and several crystal structures (Gallagher et al., Biochemistry 33:4721-4729 (1994), \u201cTwo crystal structures of the \u03b21 immunoglobulin-binding domain of streptococcal protein G and comparison with NMR\u201d) are available to provide backbone templates for the side-chain selection algorithm. In addition, the energetics and structural dynamics of G\u03b21 have been extensively characterized (Alexander et al. Biochemistry 31:3597-3603, (1992) \u201cThermodynamic analysis of the folding of the streptococcal protein G IgG-binding domains \u03b21 and \u03b22\u2014Why small proteins tend to have high denaturation temperatures\u201d); Barchi et al., Protein Sci 3:15-21 (1994) \u201cInvestigation of the backbone dynamics of the IgG-binding domain of spreptococcal protein G by heteronuclear two-dimensional 1H-15N nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy\u201d); Kuszewski et al., Protein Sci 3:1945-1952 (1994) \u201cFast folding of a prototypic polypeptide\u2014The immunoglobulin binding domain of streptococcal protein G\u201d); Orban et al., Biochemistry 34:15291-15300 (1995) \u201cAssessment of stability differences in the protein G \u03b21 and \u03b22 domains from hydrogen deuterium exchange\u2014Comparison with calorimetric data\u201d). G\u03b21 contains no disulfide bonds and does not require a cofactor or metal ion to fold, but relies upon the burial of its hydrophobic core for stability. Further, G\u03b21 contains sheet, helix and turn structures and is without the repetitive side-chain packing patterns found in coiled coils and some helical bundles. This lack of periodicity reduces the bias from a particular secondary or tertiary structure and necessitates the use of an objective algorithm for side-chain selection. Perhaps most important for this study, the G\u03b21 backbone can be classified as an \u03b1/\u03b2 fold, a class for which extensive super-secondary structure analysis has been performed (Chothia et al., 1977 (id); Janin & Chothia, 1980 (id); Cohen et al., 1982 (id); Chou et al., 1985 (id))., 364105=\u03b1100 was designed with \u03b1=1.0 and hence serves as a baseline for full incorporation of steric effects. The \u03b1100 sequence (SEQ ID NO:45) is very similar to the core sequence of (G\u03b21 (SEQ ID NO:38) (Table 6) even though no information about the naturally occurring sequence was used in the side-chain selection algorithm. Variation of \u03b1 from 0.90 to 1.05 caused little change in the optimal sequence, demonstrating the algorithm's robustness to minor parameter perturbations. Further, the packing arrangements predicted with \u03b1=0.90-1.05 closely match G\u03b21 with average \u03c7 angle differences of only 4\ufffd from the crystal structure. The high identity and conformational similarity to G\u03b21 imply that, when packing constraints are used, backbone conformation strongly determines a single family of well packed core designs. Nevertheless, the constraints on core packing were being modulated by a as demonstrated by Monte Carlo searches for other low energy sequences. Several alternate sequences and packing arrangements are in the twenty best sequences found by the Monte Carlo procedure when \u03b1=0.90. These alternate sequences score much worse when \u03b1=0.95, and when \u03b1=1.0 or 1.05 only strictly conservative packing geometries have low energies. Therefore, \u03b1=1.05 and \u03b1=0.90 define the high and low ends, respectively, of a range where packing specificity dominates sequence design., 32505=Several groups have applied and experimentally tested systematic, quantitative methods to protein design with the goal of developing general design algorithms (Hellinga, et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222: 763-785 (1991); Hurley, et al., J. Mol. Biol. 224:1143-1154 (1992); Desjarlaisl, et al., Protein Science 4:2006-2018 (1995); Harbury, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:8408-8412 (1995): Klemba, et al., Nat. Struc. Biol. 2:368-373 (1995); Nautiyal, et al., Biochemistry 34:11645-11651 (1995); Betzo, et al., Biochemistry 35:6955-6962 (1996); Dahiyat, et al., Protein Science 5:895-903 (1996); Jones, Protein Science 3:567-574 (1994); Konoi, et al., Proteins: Structure, Function and Genetics 19:244-255 (1994)). These algorithms consider the spatial positioning and steric complementarity of side chains by explicitly modeling the atoms of sequences under consideration. To date, such techniques have typically focused on designing the cores of proteins and have scored sequences with van der Waals and sometimes hydrophobic solvation potentials., 282639=To assess the predictive power of these QSAR equations, as well as their robustness, cross validation analysis was carried out. Each peptide was sequentially removed from the data set and the coefficients of the equation in question were refit. This new equation was then used to predict the withheld data point. When all of the data points had been predicted in this manner, their correlation to the measured Tm's was computed (Table 3). Only the EMC/\u0394Anp QSAR and the EMC/\u0394Anp/\u0394Ap QSAR performed well in cross validation. The EMC/\u0394Anp equation could not be expected to fit the data as smoothly as QSAR's with three terms and hence had a lower cross validated r2. However, all other two term QSAR's had LOF scores greater than 48 and cross validation correlations less than 0.55 (data not shown). The QSAR analysis independently predicted with no subjective bias that consideration of nonpolar and polar surface area burial is necessary to improve the simulation. This result is consistent with previous studies on atomic salvation potentials (Eisenberg, et al. (1986) (supra); Wesson, et al., Protein Sci. 1:227 (1992)). Further, simpler structural measures, such as number of buried atoms, that reflect underlying principles such as hydrophobic solvation (Chan, et al., Science 267:1463 (1995)) were not deemed as significant by the QSAR analysis. These results justify the cost of calculating actual surface areas, though in some studies simpler potentials have been shown to perform well (van Gunsteren, et al. J. Mol. Biol 227:389 (1992))., 290085=All possible sequences of hydrophilic amino acids (D, E, N, Q, K, R, S, T, A, and H) for the 12 surface positions were screened by our design algorithm. The torsional flexibility of the amino acid side chains was accounted for by considering a discrete set of all allowed conformers of each side chain, called rotamers (Ponder, et at, (1987) (supra); Dunbrack, et al., Struc. Biol. Vol. 1(5):334-340 (1994)). Optimizing the 12 b, c, and f positions each with 10 possible amino acids results in 1012 possible sequences which corresponds to \u02dc1028 rotamer sequences when using the Dunbrack and Karplus backbone-dependent rotamer library. The immense search problem presented by rotamer sequence optimization is overcome by application of the Dead-End Elimination (DEE) theorem (Desmet, et al., (1992( (supra); Desmet, et al., (1994) (supra); Goldstein, (1994) (supra)). Our implementation of the DEE theorem extends its utility to sequence design and rapidly finds the globally optimal sequence in its optimal conformation., 339721=The protein structure was modeled on the backbone coordinates of G\u03b21. PDB record 1pga (Bernstein, et al., supra; Gallagher, et al., 1994). Atoms of all side chains not optimized were left in their crystallographically determined positions. The program BIOGRAF (Molecular Simulations Incorporated, San Diego, Calif.) was used to generate explicit hydrogens on the structure which was then conjugate gradient minimized for 50 steps using the Dreiding forcefield (Mayo, et al., 1990, supra). The rotamer library, DEE optimization and Monte Carlo search was as outlined above. A Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential was used for van der Waals interactions, with atomic radii scaled for the various cases as discussed herein. The Richards definition of solvent-accessible surface area (Lee & Richards, supra) was used and areas were calculated with the Connolly algorithm (Connolly, (1983) (supra)). An atomic solvation parameter, derived from our previous work, of 23 cal/mol/\u212b2 was used to favor hydrophobic burial and to penalize solvent exposure. To calculate side-chain nonpolar exposure in our optimization framework, we first consider the total hydrophobic area exposed by a rotamer in isolation. This exposure is decreased by the area buried in rotamer/template contacts, and the sum of the areas buried in pairwise rotamer/rotamer contacts., 269504=The characterization of the PDA peptides demonstrates the successful design of several stable dimeric helical coiled coils. The sequences were automatically generated in the context of the design paradigm by the simulation module using well-defined inputs that explicitly consider the HP patterning and steric specificity of protein structure. Two dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance experiments aimed at probing the specificity of the tertiary packing are the focus of further studies on these peptides. Initial experiments show significant protection of amide protons from chemical exchange and chemical shift dispersion comparable to GCN4-p1 (unpublished results) (Oas, et al., Biochemistry 29:2891 (1990)); Goodman & Kim, Biochem. 30:11615 (1991))., 37736=FIG. 5 depicts the helical wheel diagram of a coiled coil. One heptad repeat is shown viewed down the major axes of the helices. The a and d positions define the solvent-inaccessible core of the molecule (Cohen & Parry, 1990, Proteins, Structure, Function and Genetics 7:1-15)., 110872=In a preferred embodiment, a hydrogen bond potential scoring function is used. A hydrogen bond potential is used as predicted hydrogen bonds do contribute to designed protein stability (see Stickle et al., J. Mol. Biol. 226:1143 (1992); Huyghues-Despointes et al., Biochem. 34:13267 (1995), both of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference). As outlined previously, explicit hydrogens are generated on the protein backbone structure., 29673=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Ser. No. 60/043,464, filed Apr. 11, 1997, Ser. No. 60/054,678, filed Aug. 4, 1997, Ser. No. 60/061,097, filed Oct. 3, 1997, Ser. No. 60/087,561, filed Jun. 1, 1998, and is a continuing application of U.S. Ser. No. 09/127,926, filed Jul. 31, 1998 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,269,312, and Ser. No. 09/058,459, filed Apr. 10, 1998 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,188,965., 338697=All possible core sequences consisting of alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine or tryptophan (A, V, L, I, F, Y or W) were considered. Our rotamer library was similar to that used by Desmet and coworkers (Desmet, et al., (1992) (supra)). Optimizing the sequence of the core of G\u03b21 (SEQ ID NO:38) with 217 possible hydrophobic rotamers at all 11 positions results in 21711, or 5\ufffd1025, rotamer sequences. Our scoring function consisted of two components: a van der Waals energy term and an atomic solvation term favoring burial of hydrophobic surface area. The van der Waals radii of all atoms in the simulation were scaled by a factor \u03b1 (Eqn. 3) to change the importance of packing effects. Radii were not scaled for the buried surface area calculations. By predicting core sequences with various radii scalings and then experimentally characterizing the resulting proteins, a rigorous study of the importance of packing effects on protein design is possible., 308136=The secondary structures and thermal stabilities of the peptides were assessed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The CD spectra of the peptides at 1\ufffd C. and 40 \u03bcM are characteristic of a helices, with minima at 208 and 222 nm, except for the random surface sequence peptide 6E (SEQ ID NO:36). 6E (SEQ ID NO:36) has a spectrum suggestive of a mixture of a helix and random coil with a [\u03b8]222 of \u221212000 deg cm2/dmol, while all the other peptides are greater than 90% helical with [\u03b8]222 of less than \u221230000 deg cm2/dmol. The melting temperatures (Tm's) of the designed peptides are 12-16\ufffd C. higher than the Tm of GCN4-p1 (SEQ ID NO: 31), with the exception of 6E (SEQ ID NO: 36) which has a Tm of 15\ufffd C. CD spectra taken before and after melts were identical indicating reversible thermal denaturation. The redesign of surface positions of this coiled coil produces structures that are much more stable than wildtype GCN4-p1 (SEQ ID NO:31), while a random hydrophilic sequence largely disrupts the peptide's stability., 609228=Although structures have not yet been determined for the six mutants that show good chemical shift dispersion in their NMR spectra, the magnitude of the backbone perturbations used to calculate these sequences are similar to the backbone perturbations observed for core mutations in other proteins (Baldwin et al., 1993, Lim et al., 1994). Elucidation of the structures of several of the mutants should contribute to our general understanding of the deformation modes available to protein backbones of the \u03b1/\u03b2 class and should help define ranges of super-secondary structure parameter value perturbations that will be useful in future sequence calculations., 526985=Four sets of perturbed backbones were generated by varying G\u03b21's super-secondary structure parameter values (FIG. 14). All possible core sequences consisting of alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan (A, V, L, I, F, Y and W) were considered for each perturbed backbone. The rotamer library was as described above (see Dahiyat & Mayo, 1996, supra). Optimizing the sequences of the cores of G\u03b21 and its structural homologues with 217 possible hydrophobic rotamers considered at each of the ten core positions results in 21710 (\u02dc1023) rotamer sequences. Our scoring function consisted of two components: a van der Waals energy term and an atomic salvation term favoring burial of hydrophobic surface area. The van der Waals radii of the atoms in the simulation were scaled by either 1.0 or 0.9 in order to reduce the effects of using discrete rotamers (see Mayo et al., 1990, supra, and Example 6). Global optimum sequences for each of the backbone variants were found using the Dead-End Elimination (DEE) theorem (Desmet et al., 1992, supra; Desmet et al., 1994, supra; Goldstein, 1994, supra). Optimal sequences, and their corresponding proteins, are named by the backbone perturbation type, the size of the perturbation and the radius scale factor used in their design. For example, the sequence designed using a template whose helix was translated by +1.50 \u212b along the sheet axis and a radius scale factor of 0.9 is called \u0394h0.9[+1.50 \u212b]. Backbone perturbations that result in the same calculated core sequence are named by the perturbation with the greatest magnitude. For example, \u0394h0.9 backbone perturbations of +1.25 and +1.50 \u212b result in the same sequence which is called \u0394h0.9[+1.50 \u212b]. The calculated core sequences corresponding to various backbone perturbations are listed in Tables 1-5, below., 373889=Near UV CD spectra and the extent of 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid (ANS) binding were used to assess the structural ordering of the proteins. The near UV CD spectra of \u03b185 and \u03b190 have strong peaks as expected for proteins with aromatic residues fixed in a unique tertiary structure while \u03b170 and \u03b1107 have featureless spectra indicative of proteins with mobile aromatic residues, such as non-native collapsed states or unfolded proteins. \u03b170 also binds ANS well, as indicated by a three-fold intensity increase and blue shift of the ANS emission spectrum. This strong binding suggests that \u03b170 possesses a loosely packed or partially exposured cluster of hydrophobic residues accessible to ANS. ANS binds \u03b185 weakly, with only a 25% increase in emission intensity, similar to the association seen for some native proteins (Semisotnov, et al., Biopolymers 31:119 (1991)). \u03b190 and \u03b1107 cause no change in ANS fluorescence. All of the proteins migrated as monomers during size exclusion chromatography., 447551=In order to examine the robustness of the computed sequence, the sequence of FSD-1 (SEQ ID NO:3) was used as the starting point of a Monte Carlo simulated annealing run. The Monte Carlo search finds high scoring, suboptimal sequences in the neighborhood of the optimal solution (Dahiyat, et al., (1996) (supra)). The energy spread from the ground-state solution to the 1000th most stable sequence is about 5 kcal/mol indicating that the density of states is high. The amino acids comprising the core of the molecule, with the exception of position 7, are essentially invariant (FIG. 11). Almost all of the sequence variation occurs at surface positions, and typically involves conservative changes. Asn 14, which is predicted to form a helix N-cap, is among the most conserved surface positions. The strong sequence conservation observed for critical areas of the molecule suggests that if a representative sequence folds into the design target structure, then perhaps thousands of sequences whose variations do not disrupt the critical interactions may be equally competent. Even if billions of sequences would successfully achieve the target fold, they would represent only a vanishingly small proportion of the 1027 possible sequences.}",
