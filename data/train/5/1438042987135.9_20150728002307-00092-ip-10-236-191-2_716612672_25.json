Boston finished with the best record in the regular season this year, but its road stopped against the Original Six rival in another classic playoff series., 16452=NOTES: The teams last played a Game 7 in the first round in 2011, when the Bruins won in overtime en route to the Stanley Cup title. ... The team that scored the first goal won every game. ... Boston coach Claude Julien tied Mike Keenan with 10 Game 7s, the most in NHL history. ... Chara's 11 Game 7s are the most of any active player. ... Iginla's goal snapped Price's shutout streak of 103:46., 13211=It's just the second time since winning their NHL-best 24th Stanley Cup title in 1993 that the Canadiens have reached the third round of the playoffs., 14194=The Canadiens scored just 2:18 into the game to quiet the Boston crowd and then made it 2-0 midway through the second period. Jarome Iginla made it 2-1 at the end of the second, but Briere chipped in a power-play goal off Bruins defenseman Zdeno Chara's skate with about 3 minutes left to make it 3-1., 16014=Boston made it a one-goal game when Torey Krug's wrist shot was deflected into the net by Iginla with just 2:02 left in the second period. But despite outshooting Montreal 21-12 over the final 40 minutes, the Bruins were not able to tie it up., 55752=\u00a9 2000-2014 Rogers Media. All rights reserved.
