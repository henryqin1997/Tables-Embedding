Mr. Carrabba served as our President and Chief Executive Officer from September 2006 through May 2007 and as our President and Chief Operating Officer from May 2005 to September 2006. Mr.\u00a0Carrabba has served as a director of KeyCorp since November 2009 and a director of Newmont Mining Corporation since June 2007. In addition, he currently is a director of Great Lakes Science Center and Capital University and sits on the boards of American Iron and Steel Institute and National Mining Association., 314221=Specifically, the 2011 compensation peer group included a broader cross-section of North American companies in the Materials sector with both revenue (measured on a trailing four-quarter average and the year-end fiscal average) and market capitalization (as of the end of September 2010 and on a three-year average) in the range of one-third to three times those of Cliffs. Semler Brossy recommended relatively broad selection criteria of between one-third and three times the size of Cliffs in order to obtain an appropriately large sample set and to reflect Cliffs\u0092 market capitalization and expanding globalization. Semler Brossy did not believe that a more narrow definition (e.g., one-half to two times revenue, which was utilized previously) would have included sufficient results., 258801=Payment of 2011 awards under this plan was subject to the achievement of performance measures that fall into four categories, which are weighted at 25 percent each:, 96136=Governance and Nominating Committee. From January\u00a01, 2011 through June\u00a030, 2011, the members of the Governance and Nominating Committee consisted of Messrs. Phillips (Chairman), Kirsch and Schwartz, and Mses. Cunningham and Green. Since July\u00a01, 2011, the members of the Governance and Nominating Committee have consisted of Messrs. Phillips (Chairman), Kirsch, Schwartz and Ross, and Mses. Cunningham and Green. The Governance and Nominating Committee is involved in determining Director compensation and reviews and administers our Director compensation plans; monitors the Board governance process and provides counsel to the CEO on Board governance and other matters; recommends changes in membership and responsibility of Board committees; and acts as the Board\u0092s Nominating Committee and Proxy Committee in the election of Directors. The Governance and Nominating Committee held five meetings during 2011. The charter of the Governance and Nominating Committee is available at http://www.cliffsnaturalresources.com., 93730=Audit Committee. The members of the Audit Committee from January\u00a01, 2011 through June\u00a030, 2011 consisted of Messrs. Riederer (Chairman), Kirsch and Schwartz, and Mses. Green and Henry. Since July\u00a01, 2011, the Audit Committee membership has consisted of Messrs. Riederer (Chairman), Gluski, Ross and Schwartz, and Mses. Green and Henry., 266621=Our Executive Management Performance Incentive Plan paid out at 127 percent, compared to 121.8 percent for 2010, driven by:, 93184=All committees regularly report their activities, actions and recommendations to Cliffs\u0092 Board. During 2011, one independent Director attended at least 90 percent of all meetings, while the remaining independent Directors attended at least 94 percent of the aggregate total of Cliffs\u0092 Board and committee meetings. No Director attended less than 75 percent of Cliffs\u0092 Board or committee meetings of which they were members., 400382=For 2011, the performance results under the EMPI Plan produced an overall payout level equal to 127 percent of the target bonus opportunities for the named executive officers. The Compensation Committee arrived at this funding level by taking the following factors into consideration:, 115091=In 2010, the Board adopted a majority voting policy whereby, in an uncontested election, any nominee for director who fails to receive a majority of the votes cast (which excludes abstentions and broker non-votes) is expected to tender his or her resignation. In such an event, the Governance and Nominating Committee will consider the tendered resignation and make a recommendation to the Board., 371624=However, over recent years there has been a shift in the industry from annual pricing in iron ore markets toward shorter-term pricing arrangements linked to spot prices, including the Platts iron ore Fe 62% index. In addition, as we have sought to strategically diversify our portfolio of mineral products, a greater portion of our business is expected to be outside of iron ore over time. As a result, the process of adjusting performance metric targets for changes in prices on a continuous basis became highly complex and difficult for management to track and communicate, undermining the intended effect of incentive plans to motivate management performance toward specific goals. In addition, with the shift toward spot prices, management and the Compensation Committee explicitly wanted to emphasize and incentivize the commercial aspects of our business with a focus on price realization as a key driver for 2011., 502191=Under our VNQDC Plan, annual incentive payments for the 2011 plan year could be deferred into a cash deferral account or a share unit account. Share awards could only be deferred into share units. Cash deferrals earn interest at the Moody\u0092s Corporate Average Bond Yield, which was approximately 4.9 percent for 2011. Share unit deferrals are denominated in Common Shares and vary with our share price performance., 250541=In 2011, we executed a number of strategic transactions and accomplished several financial, operational and sustainability milestones, positioning us among the fastest growing businesses in North America. These included:, 22841=Finally, Roger Phillips and Alan Schwartz will not be standing for re-election at the 2012 Annual Meeting pursuant to the retirement policy contained in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Mr.\u00a0Phillips has served as a Director of Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. since 2002 and Mr.\u00a0Schwartz has served as a Director since 1991. We thank Messrs. Phillips and Schwartz for their important contributions and wish them well., 504949=Other Benefits. Our other benefits and perquisites for senior executives, including named executive officers, are limited to company-paid parking and personal financial services. The Compensation Committee believes that providing financial services and company-paid parking will prevent distraction from duties as an executive officer of Cliffs. Due to the location of our corporate offices, we provide company-paid parking to our upper-level management and executive officers. These benefits are disclosed below in the \u00932011 Summary Compensation Table\u0094 under \u0093All Other Compensation\u0094 and described in footnote (6)., 399135=Performance targets for the financial objectives under the EMPI Plan were established at the beginning of 2011. Each performance element was assigned a minimum threshold level, a target level and a maximum level, representing attainment of 25 percent, 50 percent and 100 percent, respectively, of the maximum award opportunity associated with that element. For performance below the minimum threshold performance requirement for each metric, funding would be zero percent for that factor. The maximum payout under the Corporate Strategic Objectives in the EMPI Plan is 25 percent of the maximum bonus opportunity and requires the attainment of at least one financial performance metric. The Compensation Committee can exercise negative discretion for the Corporate Strategic Objectives down to zero percent of the maximum bonus opportunity. The Compensation Committee approves performance targets and ranges for each of the financial performance measures, taking into consideration management financial plans for the coming year. Performance targets are approved each year by the Compensation Committee in the first quarter., 274143=Performance shares for the 2009 \u0096 2011 performance period paid out at 150 percent of target, similar to the 2008 \u0096 2010 performance period, which is the maximum possible level of performance, based on:, 676149=Under his retirement arrangement, Mr.\u00a0Calfee\u0092s 2011 EMPI award was not prorated on account of his retirement, and he received the full amount of his 2011 EMPI award (which amount is disclosed in the \u0093Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation\u0094 column of this \u00932011 Summary Compensation Table\u0094). In addition, Mr.\u00a0Calfee\u0092s 2009 \u0096 2011 performance shares and restricted share units were not prorated on account of his retirement, and his 2010 \u0096 2012 performance shares and restricted share units will not be prorated as a result of his retirement. We also agreed to reimburse Mr.\u00a0Calfee for any additional tax or interest on the payments of the 2011 EMPI award or the 2009 \u0096 2011 or 2010 \u0096 2012 LTIP awards if those payments do not comply with Section\u00a0409A of the Code., 369410=For each of these named executive officers other than Messrs. Carrabba and Calfee, a second EMPI bonus opportunity was made available in addition to the above 2011 awards. The additional EMPI awards had a potential maximum payout of eight percent of base salary, a target of four percent of base salary and a threshold of two percent of base salary. The additional EMPI awards were subject not only to the achievement of one of our nine financial performance objectives, but also to further reduction based on individual negative discretion eligibility requirements, as determined by the Compensation Committee based upon the CEO\u0092s recommendation. The 2011 EMPI awards, expressed as dollar amounts, are shown in the \u00932011 Grants of Plan-Based Awards\u0094 table below. Mr.\u00a0Mehan was not eligible for any EMPI award opportunity in 2011., 614516=See the \u00932011 Grants of Plan-Based Awards\u0094 table for more detail on the awards of performance shares and restricted share units., 388958=The Compensation Committee believes that the range of performance measures are appropriately difficult to attain and tested the performance history for those that were included in the former EMPI Plan, specifically cost control and corporate strategic objectives. Additionally, the target-setting methodology used in prior years was consistent with the target-setting methodology used for 2011 performance metrics. Actual historical results have been as follows:, 324279=Market Positioning. During 2011, the Compensation Committee targeted total compensation between the median and 75th percentile of competitive market practices. This above-market pay positioning reflects the rapid pace of our growth and the Compensation Committee\u0092s desire to attract, retain and motivate the needed level of talent for the organization while managing costs to an objectively reasonable level. Above-market pay positioning is achieved by targeting base salary at the median and short-term and long-term incentives at above-market medians in order to emphasize performance-based pay. Actual pay positioning for any individual executive officer was higher or lower than this overall target positioning based on individual performances, including factors such as individual skills, experience, contribution, performance, internal fairness or other factors that the Compensation Committee took into account that were relevant to the individual executive., 265861=As a result of this balanced approach, our total realized compensation for executives for 2011 was not substantially different than 2010. For example:, 325374=Compensation positioning for senior executives outside of the United States generally was managed in a similar fashion; however, internal fairness considerations were also a significant factor. As a result, while we evaluated pay for internationally based executives relative to local market context, actual target pay opportunity generally (with the exception of Mr.\u00a0Price) was positioned between local market practices and practices for their U.S. counterparts. Concurrent with our Global Reorganization in January 2011, Mr.\u00a0Price\u0092s new global operations responsibilities were considered and thus his pay positioning was targeted to the same levels as his U.S. counterparts., 77470=As a sitting chairman and chief executive officer of a North American mining company for 11 years, Mr. McAllister brings significant mining and leadership expertise to the Board. As a sitting chairman, Mr. McAllister\u0092s experience in fostering good communication between directors and management is invaluable in his capacity as Lead Director. Mr. McAllister stepped down as Chairman of the Compensation and Organization Committee effective September\u00a01, 2011, but remained Lead Director., 372667=In order to address these changing business needs, we modified the EMPI scorecard for 2011 to separate pre-tax earnings into specific volume and price metrics, measured at the business segment level. Management and the Compensation Committee believe that this balance of factors better reflects the controllable elements of our business in light of the changes discussed above., 246725=2011 was a year of record achievement for us, driven by a combination of strong demand for our products and excellent operational execution. Specifically:, 118036=Directors who are not Cliffs\u0092 employees receive an annual retainer fee, fees for meeting attendance and an annual equity award. The Lead Director and Committee Chairpersons receive additional retainer fees. Employee Directors receive no additional compensation for their service as Directors. Certain changes to the retainer and per-meeting fees were made during 2011, which were effective April\u00a01, 2011. The following table sets forth the retainer and per-meeting fee schedules in effect for the first quarter of 2011 and each quarter thereafter, respectively:, 47761=Cumulative Voting. If notice in writing shall be given by any shareholder to the President, a Vice President or the Secretary of the Company, not less than 48 hours before the time fixed for the holding of the 2012 Annual Meeting, that such shareholder desires that the voting for the election of Directors shall be cumulative, and if an announcement of the giving of such notice is made upon the convening of the 2012 Annual Meeting by the Chairman or Secretary or by or on behalf of the shareholder giving such notice, each shareholder shall have the right to cumulate such voting power as he or she possesses at such election. Under cumulative voting, a shareholder may cast for any one nominee as many votes as shall equal the number of Directors to be elected, multiplied by the number of his or her Common Shares. All of such votes may be cast for a single nominee or may be distributed among any two or more nominees as he or she may desire. If cumulative voting is invoked, and unless contrary instructions are given by a shareholder who signs a proxy, all votes represented by such proxy will be cast in such manner and in accordance with the discretion of the person acting as proxy as will result in the election of as many of Cliffs\u0092 Board\u0092s nominees as is possible., 476891=Under the terms of the grants, the first condition to earn the performance shares may be triggered anytime between the date of the grant and December\u00a031, 2013 if our aggregate value, defined as market capitalization, increases by 50 percent or more over the aggregate value as of the last 60 trading days of 2009. We refer to this condition as the \u0093Performance Trigger\u0094. If the Performance Trigger occurs, then the grant would be eligible to pay out at the end of the term of the grant, assuming Mr.\u00a0Carrabba still is employed by Cliffs at that time. If the Performance Trigger does not occur, or if Mr.\u00a0Carrabba voluntarily terminates his employment before December\u00a031, 2013, then there would be no payout under the grant. The Performance Trigger was achieved in 2010., 91356=Meetings; Committees. During 2011, eight meetings of Cliffs\u0092 Board and 31 meetings of Cliffs\u0092 Board committees were held. Our independent Directors held seven meetings in executive session without the presence of Mr.\u00a0Carrabba in 2011. Mr.\u00a0McAllister has served as Lead Director since May 2004. He chaired all of the Board\u0092s executive session meetings in 2011. Directors also discharge their responsibilities by reviewing reports to Directors, visiting our facilities, corresponding with the CEO, and conducting telephone conferences with the CEO and Directors regarding matters of interest and, 905185=The tables and discussion below reflect the compensation payable to each of the named executive officers other than Messrs. Calfee and Mehan in the event of termination of such executive\u0092s employment under a variety of different circumstances, including voluntary termination, involuntary not-for-cause termination, and termination following a change in control. The amounts shown assume in all cases that such termination was effective as of December\u00a030, 2011. All amounts shown are, 502727=The Board of Directors froze the VNQDC Plan at the end of 2011 and approved the 2012 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan, which is referred to as the 2012 NQDC Plan, to be effective as of the beginning of 2012 and pursuant to which executives are eligible for only cash-based deferrals, including base salary and payments under the EMPI Plan., 66146=SUSAN M. GREEN, 52, Deputy General Counsel, U.S. Congressional Office of Compliance since November 2007. Ms.\u00a0Green served as aide to Council member Nancy Floreen, Montgomery County, Maryland from December 2002 to August 2005. Ms.\u00a0Green originally was proposed as a nominee for the Board by the United Steelworkers, or USW, pursuant to the terms of our 2004 labor agreement., 531295=Pursuant to the terms of our 2007 Incentive Equity Plan, unvested amounts of long-term incentives will be prorated and paid at the end of the performance period, subject to Compensation Committee approval. See note (4)\u00a0to footnote (6)\u00a0to the \u00932011 Summary Compensation Table\u0094 for more information., 100145=The Compensation Committee obtains analysis and advice from an external compensation consultant to assist with the performance of its duties under its charter. The Compensation Committee directly retained Semler Brossy Consulting Group, or Semler Brossy, for 2011, and Semler Brossy helped the Compensation Committee develop an appropriate agenda for performing the Compensation Committee\u0092s responsibilities. In this regard, Semler Brossy advised and assisted the Compensation Committee in determining the appropriate objectives and goals of our executive compensation programs; in designing compensation programs that fulfill those objectives and goals; in seeking to align executive compensation programs with shareholder interests; in evaluating the effectiveness of our compensation programs; in identifying appropriate pay positioning strategies and pay levels in our executive compensation programs; and in identifying mining industry and general industry peers and identifying compensation surveys for the Compensation Committee to use to benchmark the appropriateness and competitiveness of our executive compensation program., 36981=March\u00a023, 2012, 127147=The Directors\u0092 annual equity grants are made under the Nonemployee Directors\u0092 Compensation Plan (as Amended and Restated as of December\u00a031, 2008), which we refer to as the Directors\u0092 Plan. Effective May\u00a017, 2011, the Directors\u0092 Plan provides for $80,000 worth of restricted or unrestricted Common Shares, as described below, to be awarded on the annual meeting date, unless otherwise determined by the Board. The Board has increased the value of the annual equity grants to $85,000 starting with the May\u00a08, 2012 annual meeting. Nonemployee Directors who are under age 69 on the date of the annual meeting receive an automatic annual grant of restricted shares with a three-year vesting requirement. Nonemployee Directors who are 69 years of age or older on the date of the annual meeting receive an automatic annual grant of Common Shares (with no restrictions). Three Directors received their annual equity awards in the form of unrestricted shares in May 2011, and one will receive unrestricted shares in the May 2012 annual equity grant. Any Directors who join the Board after the annual meeting receive a prorated award of restricted shares pursuant to the Directors\u0092 Plan. Directors receive dividends on their annual equity grants and may elect that all cash dividends with respect to restricted shares be deferred and reinvested in additional Common Shares. Those additional Common Shares are subject to the same restrictions as the underlying award. Cash dividends not subject to a deferral election will be paid to the Director without restriction., 1585=SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, 25820=TO BE HELD ON MAY 8, 2012, 414087=Total bonuses for 2011 under the EMPI Plan were paid in the amounts set forth in the following table to the named executive officers (Mr. Price\u0092s bonus of $542,597 AUD was converted at the 2011 average rate of $1.00 AUD : $1.033 USD). These amounts include a second EMPI bonus opportunity, as noted on page 32, of an additional 7.6 percent of base salary awarded to Ms.\u00a0Brlas, an additional seven percent awarded to Mr.\u00a0Tompkins and an additional two percent awarded to Mr.\u00a0Gallagher., 503197=In order to encourage share ownership and the alignment of executive interests with shareholder interests, as well as to assist executives in meeting their share ownership guidelines (as discussed below under \u0093Share Ownership Guidelines\u0094), we matched any annual incentive cash compensation payments deferred into share units in 2011 with a 25 percent match that vests at the end of five years. This feature is not a component of the 2012 NQDC Plan as we determined that such a match was not market competitive and was no longer needed to encourage executive stock ownership, which was the initial intention when this match was introduced. The amount of our Common Shares matched to VNQDC Plan-bonus exchange deferrals is disclosed in the \u00932011 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Table\u0094., 54415=SUSAN M. CUNNINGHAM, 56, Senior Vice President of Exploration and Business Innovation of Noble Energy Inc., an international oil and gas exploration and production company, since May 2007. Ms. Cunningham served as senior vice president of Exploration and Corporate Reserves of Noble Energy Inc. from 2005 to May 2007., 23392=We look forward to meeting with you at the 2012 Annual Meeting., 679822=value of performance shares and restricted share units earned in connection with the vesting of Mr.\u00a0Calfee\u0092s long-term incentive award for the 2009 \u0096 2011 performance period $2,579,952. This amount also is reported in the \u00932011 Options Exercises and Stock Vested Table\u0094 on page 52; and, 108987=The policy of the Governance and Nominating Committee is to consider properly submitted shareholder nominations for candidates for membership on the Board as described below under \u0093Identifying and Evaluating Nominees for Directors.\u0094 In evaluating nominations, the Governance and Nominating Committee seeks to achieve a balance of knowledge, experience and capability on Cliffs\u0092 Board and to address the membership criteria set forth below under \u0093Board Diversity and Director Qualifications.\u0094 Any shareholder nominations proposed for consideration by the Governance and Nominating Committee should include: (i)\u00a0complete information as to the identity and qualifications of the proposed nominee, including name, address, present and prior business and/or professional affiliations, education and experience, and particular fields of expertise; (ii)\u00a0an indication of the nominee\u0092s consent to serve as a Director if elected; and (iii)\u00a0the reasons why, in the opinion of the recommending shareholder, the proposed nominee is qualified and suited to be a director. Shareholder nominations should be addressed to Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., 200 Public Square, Suite 3300, Cleveland, Ohio 44114-2315, Attention: Secretary. Our Regulations provide that at any meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected, only persons nominated as candidates will be eligible for election., 315529=The resulting 20 compensation peer companies used for the 2011 analysis were as follows:, 257919=Our historical compensation approach has been to reward for the achievement of explicit operational and strategic objectives while mitigating the impact of industry volatility on uncontrollable results. In 2011, we modified specific design elements to account for changes in our business, but we maintained this fundamental design philosophy., 694368=This table discloses in columns (c), (d)\u00a0and (e)\u00a0the potential payouts at the threshold, target and maximum levels of the awards under the EMPI Plan for 2011. See \u0093Compensation Discussion and Analysis\u0097Annual Incentive Plan\u0094 above for a description of the EMPI Plan. Actual payouts for the 2011 EMPI awards are shown in the \u00932011 Summary Compensation Table.\u0094, 250087=Consistent with our focus on operational excellence, our operating margin improved from 27 percent to 35 percent year-over-year, and our pre-tax earnings and cash flows from operations were at record levels of $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, as compared to $1.3 billion and $1.3 billion for 2010, respectively., 694858=This table shows in columns (f), (g)\u00a0and (h)\u00a0the potential payouts at the threshold, target and maximum levels of the 2011 performance share awards under our 2007 Incentive Equity Plan. Such performance shares are for a three-year period ending December\u00a031, 2013.

Ms.\u00a0Henry previously served as senior vice president from 1998 through June 2006, chief financial officer from 1994 to June 2005 and treasurer from 2002 to March 2006 of Martin Marietta Materials, Inc., or Martin Marietta, a producer of construction aggregates serving the public infrastructure, commercial and residential construction markets in the United States. Ms.\u00a0Henry served in a consulting capacity for Martin Marietta from July 2006 through June 2009. Ms.\u00a0Henry was a director of Inco Limited from June 2004 through October 2006 and of North American Galvanizing\u00a0& Coatings, Inc. from February 2008 through August 2010. In January 2012, Ms.\u00a0Henry became a director of W.R. Grace\u00a0& Co., a global specialty chemicals and materials company. Since October 2009, Ms.\u00a0Henry has been a member of The Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, Inc., a nonprofit corporation, which engages in activities that contribute to the support and advancement of scientific research, technology and development., 686954=2011 payment of 2010 EMPI award ($301,529) (amount in USD and converted at the 2010 average rate of $1.00 AUD : $0.9203 USD). This amount also is reflected in Mr.\u00a0Mehan\u0092s 2010 Non-Equity Incentive Plan amount;, 356649=The 2011 changes in annual salary levels noted above reflect both the competitive market practices as well as our Global Reorganization in January 2011. Increases for Mr.\u00a0Carrabba, Ms.\u00a0Brlas and Mr.\u00a0Tompkins reflect our increased business scale and complexity and higher median salary levels among the companies included in the competitive benchmarking assessment provided by Semler Brossy. The size of the increases was intended to keep our salary levels competitive with the median of peers. The Compensation Committee approved Messrs. Gallagher\u0092s and Price\u0092s base salaries in early January 2011 to account for changes in job responsibilities due to our January 2011 Global Reorganization., 689522=an estimate of the value of Mr.\u00a0Mehan\u0092s outstanding performance shares units and retention units under his long-term incentive award for the 2010 \u0096 2012 performance period, prorated based on his termination. This estimated amount of $323,799 has been calculated using the closing price of Cliffs\u0092 Common Shares on Mr.\u00a0Mehan\u0092s termination date of $90.27 and assuming that maximum performance is achieved. The ultimate payout and value thereof will depend on the cumulative level of performance achieved during the performance period and the value of our shares at the time payment is made; and, 540544=In 2011, a team lead by our Chief Risk Officer reviewed employee compensation plans in which all employees (including the named executive officers) participate, in order to identify whether these arrangements had any features that might encourage unnecessary and excessive risk taking that would have a material adverse effect on Cliffs. The review team analyzed a series of risk factors and concluded the risk mitigation factors in our compensation plans provide adequate safeguards that would either prevent or discourage excessive risk taking. The review team did not identify any risk related to our compensation policies and practices for our named executive officers and our employees generally that are, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Cliffs. The Compensation and Organization Committee received a report summarizing the work of the review team and concurs with this conclusion., 253664=Reaching favorable final outcomes in the two 2010 arbitrations with ArcelorMittal and Essar Algoma, both of which are among Cliffs\u0092 largest customers;, 519667=For termination for reason of redundancy, a redundancy payment calculated at 4.083 times Mr.\u00a0Price\u0092s annual base salary, plus any accrued but untaken annual leave and a prorated long service leave payment and monies and shares due under the 2007 Incentive Equity Plan; and, 44307=Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect with respect to the election of Directors. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of votes against the proposal to amend our Regulations to add a provision to allow the Board to amend the Regulations without shareholder approval as permitted under Ohio law. Abstentions will have the effect of votes against, and broker non-votes will have no effect, with respect to the advisory vote regarding the compensation of our named executive officers and the vote to approve the 2012 Management Performance Incentive Plan. Abstentions will have no effect on the ratification of Deloitte\u00a0& Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. Abstentions will count as votes cast on Proposal No.\u00a04 and will have the effect of votes against the approval of the 2012 Incentive Equity Plan. Broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast with respect to the 2012 Incentive Equity Plan and will not affect whether enough affirmative votes are received to approve the plan, but will be counted in determining whether enough votes are cast on Proposal No.\u00a04 for the 2012 Incentive Equity Plan to be approved., 536938=Nevertheless, both senior leadership and the Compensation Committee remain dedicated to adopting best practices in the governance of executive pay even where shareholders have not expressed direct concern. For example, in 2011, we decided to eliminate all tax gross-ups from, 509714=Our share ownership guidelines were revised in 2010 to allow for an executive to sell a limited number of Common Shares prior to meeting the ownership guidelines so long as the executive officer can demonstrate a long-term plan in achieving the share ownership guidelines. For grants made after January\u00a01, 2007 under our 2007 Incentive Equity Plan, executives only are permitted to sell up to 50 percent of their shares received under the performance share program or the restricted share unit program unless the executive is in compliance with the share ownership guidelines, except as may be necessary to pay income taxes. An executive\u0092s direct ownership of shares, including restricted shares and share units held in the VNQDC Plan, count toward meeting the share ownership guidelines. The Compensation Committee annually reviews compliance with the share ownership guidelines., 276418=The following chart illustrates the relationship between our CEO\u0092s total compensation (as shown in the \u00932011 Summary Compensation Table\u0094) and two common measures of our financial performance., 104986=The Strategy and Sustainability Committee held seven meetings in 2011.

Given our continued growth and aggressive acquisition strategy in 2011, the compensation peer group is being modified further for 2012 and is comprised of the following 19 companies:, 454700=The total grant value noted above is based on the closing fair market price of $96.70 per share on March\u00a08, 2011, the date of grant. Messrs. Calfee and Mehan were not eligible for a 2011 \u0096 2013 long-term incentive grant., 677841=consulting fees for 2011 ($54,000);, 498240=Defined Benefit Pension Plan. We maintain a defined benefit pension plan for all U.S.-based employees, which we refer to as the Pension Plan, and a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, which is referred to as the SERP, in which all of the named executive officers, excluding Messrs. Price and Mehan because of their non-U.S. employee status, are eligible to participate following one year of service. The Compensation Committee believes that pension benefits are a typical component of total remuneration for employees and executives at companies in industries similar to ours, and that providing such benefits is important to delivering a competitive package to attract and retain employees. The objective of the SERP is to provide benefits above the statutory limits for qualified pension plans for highly paid executives. Additional detail is shown in the \u00932011 Pension Benefits Table\u0094., 931654=Our 2007 Incentive Equity Plan also clarifies that the following two plan provisions do not apply to the definition of \u0093Business Combination\u0094: (a)\u00a0persons will be considered to be acting as a group if they are owners of a corporation that enters into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar business transaction with Cliffs; and (b)\u00a0if a person, including an entity, owns stock in both corporations that enter into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar transaction, such shareholder is considered to be acting as a group with other shareholders in a corporation prior to the transaction giving rise to the change and not with respect to the ownership interest in the other corporation., 130199=The Director Share Ownership Guidelines that were in effect as of the December 2010 assessment, and which determined whether or not Directors were required to receive a portion of their, 80745=RICHARD K.

Mr. Riederer has been a director of First American Funds since September 2001. He also serves on the Board of Trustees of Franciscan University of Steubenville., 312135=Market for Talent. The Compensation Committee conducts an annual review of market pay practices for executive officers with the assistance of its outside compensation advisor. Semler Brossy conducted a review of market pay practices in late 2010 for 2011 executive compensation decisions. This review was based on several published compensation surveys, including Hewitt Associates\u0092 and Towers Watson\u0092s executive compensation general industry surveys, as well as a detailed proxy analysis of certain compensation comparison peers. For Australian executives, survey sources that focused on the Australian mining industry were used, including the Hay Group Global Mining compensation survey., 836065=The Final Average Pay Formula provides a benefit that generally is based on a 1.65 percent pension formula. For each year of service up to June\u00a030, 2003 or June\u00a030, 2008, as the case may be, the plan provides 1.65 percent of Average Monthly Compensation. Average Monthly Compensation is defined as the average annual compensation earned during the 60 consecutive months providing the highest such average during the last 120 months preceding the applicable date. The benefit is subject to an offset of 50 percent of Social Security benefits through the applicable date. Benefits are payable as an annuity, unreduced for early commencement, upon the attainment of normal retirement at age 65, or at 30 years of service. None of the named executive officers were eligible for an accrued benefit under the Final Average Pay Formula on December\u00a031, 2011 other than Mr.\u00a0Gallagher and Mr.\u00a0Calfee., 133674=The following table, supported by the accompanying footnotes and narrative, sets forth for fiscal year 2011 all compensation earned by the individuals who served as our nonemployee Directors at any time during 2011., 279075=Elimination of all tax gross-ups in executive severance agreements as of January\u00a01, 2012, including tax gross-ups related to excise taxes following a change in control and tax gross-ups related to cash payments in lieu of certain health and welfare benefits, and industry service credits related to the supplemental retirement plan benefit provided upon termination after a change in control., 75782=Mr. Kirsch, as chairman and chief executive officer of a public company, is experienced in the annual, quarterly and periodic filing obligations of the SEC. As an executive officer of a public company and chairman of its board, Mr. Kirsch is well versed in the mechanics of board compensation matters and corporate governance issues. Mr. Kirsch was a member of the Audit Committee until June\u00a030, 2011 and became a member of the Governance and Nominating Committee and Compensation and Organization Committee on July\u00a01, 2011. On September\u00a01, 2011, Mr. Kirsch was named Chairman of the Compensation and Organization Committee., 533583=Payouts made in respect to Mr.\u00a0Calfee\u0092s 2009 \u0096 2011 and 2010 \u0096 2012 performance shares and restricted share units and annual incentive plan were not prorated pursuant to the terms of his retirement with Cliffs. Lastly, the retirement arrangement also includes a provision for reimbursement of tax or interest payments on his incentive awards if not in compliance with Section\u00a0409A of the Code. See note (3)\u00a0to footnote (6)\u00a0to the \u00932011 Summary Compensation Table\u0094 for additional information on his retirement-related payments and benefits.

Performance share units and retention units are paid in cash to Asia-Pacific participants at the end of the performance period, based on the product of the exchange rate and our Common Share price on the date the Common Shares are paid to U.S. participants for grants made prior to 2011. Cash payments are made in lieu of Common Shares due to unfavorable tax liability consequences related to equity grants to Australian residents at the time of grant. All other features of the performance share units and retention units were identical to the U.S. long-term incentive vehicles. Beginning in 2011, grants made to Asia-Pacific participants are paid in Common Shares and all other features of the grants have remained the same. We made this determination so that long-term incentive awards would continue to be tied to shareholder return and in light of favorable changes in Australian tax legislation., 38048=As of March\u00a09, 2012, the record date for the determination of persons entitled to vote at the 2012 Annual Meeting, there were 142,469,891 Common Shares, par value $0.125 per share, of Cliffs Natural Resources Inc.

This proxy statement and accompanying proxy card are being first mailed or otherwise distributed to shareholders on or about March\u00a023, 2012., 500203=Superannuation. Australian employees, including Messrs. Price and Mehan, are eligible for a company cash contribution known as superannuation, of up to 15 percent of all cash payments made to the employee.\u00a0Australian regulations require a superannuation contribution of at least nine percent on base salary up to $175,280 per individual per year.\u00a0For company superannuation contributions in excess of $50,000 per annum, executives can opt to be credited with cash as a taxable superannuation cash allowance.\u00a0This benefit is disclosed below in the \u00932011 Summary Compensation Table\u0094 under \u0093All Other Compensation\u0094 and described in footnote (6)., 778659=The table also shows in columns (d)\u00a0and (e)\u00a0the actual numbers of performance shares and the fair market value, respectively, as of December\u00a031, 2011 of all unvested and unearned performance shares assuming a market value of $62.35 per share (the closing market price of our Common Shares on December\u00a030, 2011) and assuming that the performance shares pay off at the maximum level. Normally, outstanding options would be listed on this table; however, there are no outstanding stock options for any named executive officer., 20157=Our Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be held on the 3rd floor of 200 Public Square, Cleveland, Ohio 44114-2315 on Tuesday, May\u00a08, 2012 at 11:30\u00a0A.M. (Cleveland time), which we refer to as our 2012 Annual Meeting., 475168=2009 and 2010 Strategic Initiative Grant. On December\u00a017, 2009 and March\u00a08, 2010, the Compensation Committee approved an additional grant of 67,009 performance shares and 18,720 performance shares, respectively, to Mr.\u00a0Carrabba in order to further motivate and reward the CEO to grow the value of our Common Shares through effective strategic initiatives. The 2009 and 2010 Strategic Initiative Grants were designed to provide an overall target grant value of $2.6 million, which was approximately equal to one times Mr.\u00a0Carrabba\u0092s annual long-term incentive award target at the time of grant. Due to maximum annual grant limitations imposed under our 2007 Incentive Equity Plan, the total grant needed to be divided into two separate grants. The Compensation Committee believes that the magnitude of the grants is commensurate with the magnitude of business improvement included in our confidential strategic plans. The grants were determined using a 60-day average closing price ending on the date of grant (producing a maximum value at grant of approximately $3,900,000 and a target value at grant of approximately $2,600,000). The grants expire on December\u00a031, 2013., 43838=Counting of Votes. At the 2012 Annual Meeting, the results of shareholder voting will be tabulated by the inspector of elections appointed for the 2012 Annual Meeting.

Such shares will be paid when such shares and units would otherwise be paid; and, 248272=Average prices in 2011 in the seaborne market for iron ore products, a significant driver of Cliffs\u0092 revenues, increased over 15 percent from 2010 levels;, 499268=401(k) Savings Plan. Our U.S.-based executives are eligible to contribute up to 35 percent of their base salary under Cliffs\u0092 401(k) Savings Plan. Annual pre-tax contributions are limited by Internal Revenue Service regulations. For the 2011 calendar year, employee pre-tax contributions were limited to $16,500 ($22,000 for persons age 50 or older). We historically have matched 100 percent of employee contributions up to the first 3 percent and 50 percent for the next 2 percent of contributions. Additionally, we have utilized a performance-based contribution that can be made annually to the 401(k) Savings Plan. The performance-based contribution was established to deliver as much as 10 percent of eligible wages into the 401(k) Savings Plan when we meet certain profit-per-ton performance targets., 930173=At least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the entity resulting from the business transaction were members of the incumbent Board of Cliffs when the business transaction agreement was signed or approved by Cliffs\u0092 Board. For purposes of this exception, the incumbent board of directors of Cliffs generally means those directors who were serving as of August\u00a011, 2008 (or a prior date in the case of certain pre-2007 equity awards) or whose appointment or election was endorsed by a majority of the incumbent members prior to the date of such appointment or election., 348970=The Compensation Committee considered the following factors when approving 2011 annual base salaries: base pay levels at the market median, individual performance, tenure and experience, retention considerations, the individual\u0092s historical compensation and internal fairness considerations. Salaries approved for the named executive officers in 2011 were as follows (Mr. Price\u0092s base salary of $532,000 Australian dollars (\u0093AUD\u0094) is converted at the 2011 average rate of $1.00 AUD : $1.033 U.S. dollars (\u0093USD\u0094)):, 58721=BARRY J. ELDRIDGE, 66, Currently retired. Mr.\u00a0Eldridge previously served as the managing director and chief executive officer of Portman Limited, an international iron ore mining company in Australia, from October 2002 through April 2005.

Actual payouts are determined based on the weighted aggregate attainment on each performance element using the weights assigned above., 428848=On February\u00a013, 2012, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors and, on March\u00a013, 2012, the Board of Directors approved, subject to shareholder approval, the Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. 2012 Executive Management Performance Incentive Plan, or 2012 EMPI Plan, in order to continue to provide annual incentive compensation to selected senior executive officers in a method to qualify as \u0093qualified performance-based compensation\u0094 under Section\u00a0162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, or Code. The 2012 EMPI Plan is not substantially different from our EMPI Plan approved in 2007. Under the 2012 EMPI Plan, the Compensation Committee will determine eligible participants and establish target levels for incentive-based cash awards to be paid upon the achievement in whole or in part of certain pre-determined performance goals in compliance with Section\u00a0162(m). The Compensation Committee will select the method for computing the amount that a participant will be paid under each award, and such method will be stated in terms of an objective formula or standard. At the end of each plan year, the Compensation Committee will determine each participant\u0092s award payout, including, through the use of negative discretion, any reduction or elimination of award payouts, and will certify achievement of the goals prior to payment for any award. See Proposal No.\u00a05 for additional information., 837103=The Cash Balance Formula provides a benefit payable at any time equal to the value of a notional cash balance account. For each calendar quarter, after the applicable date a credit is made to the account equal to a percentage of his or her pay ranging from four percent to 10 percent based upon his or her age and service with transitional pay credits up to 13 percent during the transition period from June\u00a030, 2003 to June\u00a030, 2008. Interest is credited to the account balance on a quarterly basis. At retirement or termination of employment, the accumulated account balance can be paid as either a lump sum or actuarially equivalent annuity., 396359=2010, 73506=JAMES F. KIRSCH, 54, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ferro Corporation, or Ferro, a global supplier of technology-based materials for a broad range of manufacturers. Mr. Kirsch was elected chairman of Ferro\u0092s board of directors in December 2006 and appointed chief executive officer and a director of Ferro in November 2005. Mr. Kirsch joined Ferro in October 2004 as its president and chief operating officer. Prior to joining Ferro from 2002 through 2004, Mr. Kirsch served as president of Premix Inc. and Quantum Composites, Inc., manufacturers of thermoset molding compounds, parts and subassemblies for the automotive, aerospace, electrical and HVAC industries. From 2000 through 2002, he served as president and director of Ballard Generation Systems, a company engaged in the design, development, manufacture and sale of clean energy fuel cell products, and vice president for Ballard Power Systems in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada., 779325=OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS AT 2011 FISCAL YEAR-END TABLE, 683438=the following involuntary termination payments (amounts in USD and converted at a February\u00a04, 2011 rate of $1.00 AUD : $1.0138 USD):, 311494=Additional services requested of Semler Brossy in 2011 included a review of the Directors\u0092 compensation practices at the request of the Governance and Nominating Committee and a separate compensation review of the Chief Risk Officer at the request of the Audit Committee. The additional services provided did not exceed a cost of $120,000. Semler Brossy performs no services for Cliffs or our management except as requested by the Compensation Committee, the Governance and Nominating Committee or the Audit Committee., 242950=In this section of the proxy statement, we discuss in detail our executive compensation program for 2011 for our CEO, Joseph A. Carrabba, our CFO, Laurie Brlas, and our three next highest paid executive officers employed as of December\u00a031, 2011\u0097Duncan Price, Executive Vice President and President\u0097Global Operations, Donald J. Gallagher, Executive Vice President and President\u0097Global Commercial, and P. Kelly Tompkins, Executive Vice President, Legal, Governmental Affairs and Sustainability & Chief Legal Officer. We also discuss the compensation of William R. Calfee, our former Executive Vice President, Commercial Projects, who retired during 2011, and the compensation of Richard Mehan, our former Senior Vice President, President and Chief Executive Officer, Asia Pacific, whose employment terminated during 2011. Messrs. Calfee and Mehan are included because they had served as executive officers during 2011 and their total compensation in 2011, including retirement and/or severance benefits, qualified them as being among the three highest paid executive officers other than the CEO and CFO. We collectively refer to these individuals as our named executive officers, or NEOs. Due to their departures, Messrs. Mehan and Calfee are not included in certain sections of the discussion where Cliffs did not make material compensation decisions with respect to those executives for 2011, and they are omitted from tables where they did not receive the type of compensation shown., 534459=Certain Material Tax and Accounting Implications. Section\u00a0162(m) of the Code limits our deductibility of certain executive compensation in excess of $1 million. The aggregate combination of salary, distributions from the VNQDC, payout from the EMPI Plan, the issuance of Common Shares from the 2007 Incentive Equity Plan, vesting of restricted shares and dividends on restricted shares has caused, with respect to 2011, the $1 million limit to be exceeded with respect to all of the named executive officers, and is expected to cause the $1 million limit to be exceeded in subsequent years with respect to one or more of the named executive officers. In 2007, our shareholders approved the EMPI Plan and the 2007 Incentive Equity Plan, which replaced the predecessor plans. Performance-based compensation under the EMPI Plan and the 2007 Incentive Equity Plan will be exempt from the $1 million limit. However, certain forms of compensation, including retention units, restricted share unit grants and restricted share grants still will not qualify as performance-based compensation and thus will be included in the calculation of the $1 million limit., 686294=2011 payment of superannuation ($159,463);, 839358=2011 PENSION BENEFITS TABLE, 359526=produce a payout equal to 50 percent of the total maximum award, and an overall scoring at the threshold level would produce a payout equal to 25 percent of the maximum award.

These specific cash accounts are not convertible to share units. Similarly, if a named executive officer\u0092s salary contributions to the 401(k) Savings Plan are limited by Internal Revenue Code limits, the amount that exceeds the limit will be credited to the executive\u0092s account under the VNQDC Plan together with the Cliffs\u0092 match he or she would have had under the 401(k) Savings Plan., 98837=Compensation and Organization Committee.

From January\u00a01, 2011 to June\u00a030, 2011, the Strategy and Sustainability Committee consisted of Messrs. Eldridge (Chairman), McAllister and Riederer, and Ms.\u00a0Cunningham.

Today, we are an international mining and natural resources company. A member of the S&P 500 Index, we are a major global producer of iron ore and a significant producer of high- and low-volatile metallurgical coal. Our business strategy is designed to achieve growth in the global mining industry and focus on serving the world\u0092s largest and fastest growing steel markets, while continuing to manage our operations in an efficient, safe and responsible manner.

This estimated amount of, 431987=Each year, we establish a target long-term incentive award value for each executive based on market practices as a pre-determined percentage of base salary. Semler Brossy reviewed the values in 2011. Actual awards to each executive may vary from this target based on the CEO\u0092s assessment of individual performance in the case of executives other than the CEO, and based on the Compensation Committee\u0092s assessment of the CEO\u0092s performance in the case of grants made to the CEO., 444953=2011 \u0096 2013 Performance Share and Restricted Share Unit Awards. On March\u00a08, 2011, the Compensation Committee approved performance share and restricted share unit awards under the 2007 Incentive Equity Plan for our executives, including its named executive officers. The number of shares granted to each executive was then determined by dividing the total grant values by the 60-day average closing price of our Common Shares ending on the date of grant ($86.48 for grants made in 2011). The use of the 60-day average price to calibrate the number of shares granted limits the potential to grant an unusually high or low number of shares due to an exceptionally low or high share price on the date of the grant. In order to calibrate the grant made to Mr.\u00a0Price in 2011, a 60-day average foreign exchange rate ending on March\u00a08, 2011 was used to convert Mr.\u00a0Price\u0092s salary from Australian to U.S. dollars. The following amounts of performance shares and restricted share units were awarded to our named executive officers for the 2011 \u0096 2013 performance period:, 433614=Performance Shares. Under the Amended and Restated Cliffs 2007 Incentive Equity Plan, or 2007 Incentive Equity Plan, performance shares are the primary vehicle we use to deliver long-term incentives. A performance share granted in 2011 provides an opportunity to earn Common Shares based on our performance over a three-year period, with potential funding between zero percent and 200 percent of the target grant depending on the level of performance against goals. Beginning with performance share grants for the 2011 \u0096 2013 performance period, we determined that the maximum payout would be 200 percent of the target number of shares granted rather than 150 percent in order to align maximum performance share opportunities with our peer company equity practices. We use performance shares to reward for shareholder results relative to industry conditions, taking into consideration returns to our shareholders as compared to other companies\u0092 returns in the steel and mining industries, and our free cash flow in relation to our business plan. Performance shares comprise 75 percent of the total target annual long-term grant., 245758=2011 Business Results, 267362=Sales volume achievement above target for North American Iron Ore (note that for purposes of the 2011 EMPI performance metrics, the North American Iron Ore business segment consisted of what is now our United States Iron Ore business segment and the Wabush mine as we revised our business segments later in 2011 after acquiring additional Eastern Canadian operations);, 291521=Our guiding compensation principles for 2011 were as follows:, 130905=2011 retainers in Common Shares, provided that a Director should hold or acquire by the end of a four-year period the lesser of either (i)\u00a04,000 or more Common Shares, or (ii)\u00a0Common Shares having a market value of at least $100,000. We amended our Director Share Ownership Guidelines at the beginning of 2011. The amended guidelines, which applied to the December 2011 assessment with respect to Director elections for 2012 retainer payments, require a Director to hold or acquire Common Shares having a market value of at least $250,000 within five years of becoming a Director., 481022=Pursuant to the terms of the grants, the Compensation Committee may exercise negative discretion to reduce the size of the payout under the grants based on Mr.\u00a0Carrabba\u0092s performance relative to these performance factors. As a result of this uncertainty of the final grant amount and under applicable accounting guidance, a grant date fair value has not yet been determined for these grants for purposes of measuring and recognizing compensation cost. The total target payout under the grants would be 57,153 Common Shares taking into account both grants made in December 2009 and March 2010, with a potential maximum payout of 85,729 Common Shares., 811887=Columns (b)\u00a0and (c)\u00a0in the following table set forth certain information regarding performance shares, retention units and restricted share awards that vested during 2011 for the named executive officers based on the applicable fair market value.

In February 2012, the Compensation Committee determined that for the three-year performance period ended December\u00a031, 2011, we achieved total shareholder return performance near the top of our peer group and free cash flow performance above the maximum value set in 2009. This provided a total performance factor of 150 percent for the 2009 \u0096 2011 performance period. A payout for such performance period was made in Common Shares in February 2012 to all participants, including all named executive officers with the exception of Messrs. Price and Mehan. Messrs. Price and Mehan received cash payments based upon the closing price of our Common Shares and the foreign exchange rate at the end of the performance period. Mr.\u00a0Mehan\u0092s cash payment was prorated based on his termination with us in 2011. The performance share award for the named executive officers for the 2009 \u0096 2011 performance period is disclosed under the \u00932011 Option Exercises and Stock Vested Table\u0094 in footnote (2). The payout calculation for the 2009 \u0096 2011 grants is as follows:, 262400=Payment of the performance shares granted for the 2011 \u0096 2013 performance period is subject to the achievement of two goals, which are weighted 50 percent each:, 865922=This table discloses in column (b)\u00a0\u0093Executive Contributions in Last Fiscal Year,\u0094 the contributions by each named executive officer to the VNQDC Plan.

On March\u00a012, 2012, the Compensation Committee approved performance share and restricted share unit grants under the 2007 Incentive Equity Plan for our executives, including our named executive officers. The grants were determined using a 60-day average closing price of our Common Shares ending on March\u00a012, 2012 of $68.00 per share and the grant targets described above.

Matched amounts vest at the end of five years., 370731=In early 2011 the Compensation Committee approved a substantial revision to the performance scorecard used for the EMPI as compared to prior years in order to reflect changes to our business and markets. Prior to 2011, our EMPI scorecard historically emphasized pre-tax earnings as a major driver of incentive pay, along with cost control measures for each major business unit and corporate strategic objectives. In addition, for our EMPI Plan prior to 2011, the Compensation Committee had approved an adjustment to the pre-tax earnings and cost goals to reflect changes in world iron ore prices, which have a major impact on earnings results but are not controlled by management, consistent with the philosophy of mitigating performance results for industry conditions., 397550=2011, 392663=2007, 244566=The following discussion focuses primarily on compensation actions taken and decisions made during our 2011 fiscal year, but also contains information regarding compensation actions taken and decisions made both before and after fiscal year 2011 to the extent that information enhances the understanding of our executive compensation program.

Whichever of these methods you choose, the named proxies will vote your shares in accordance with your instructions. Please note that failure to vote surrenders voting power to those who exercise their voting right. If you attend the meeting, you will be entitled to vote in person., 418593=Mr.\u00a0Mehan was not eligible for an EMPI payment for 2011 performance., 87105=Our Board of Directors has determined that each of the current Directors standing for re-election, other than Mr.\u00a0Carrabba, and all of the current members of the Audit, Governance and Nominating, and Compensation and Organization Committees, have no material relationship with us (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with us) and is independent within our director independence standards, which reflect exactly the NYSE director independence standards. Ronald C. Cambre served as a Director during 2011 until the 2011 annual meeting and the Board of Directors also determined that Mr.\u00a0Cambre met these independence standards. Mr.\u00a0Carrabba is our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and as such, is not considered independent. He does not serve as a member of any of Cliffs\u0092 Board committees., 434872=Each executive officer is granted a target number of performance shares at the beginning of each three-year period. For the 2011 grant, our total shareholder return, or TSR, and that of our performance peers (identified below) are measured on a cumulative basis from the beginning of the performance period to the end of the performance period. At the end of three years, our TSR is compared to the TSR performance of our peers to determine the total performance over the three-year period and the number of shares earned at the end of the period. Funding for TSR performance below threshold is zero percent and funding at the maximum performance is capped at 200 percent. In addition to TSR, performance shares also are subject to a three-year cumulative free cash flow performance metric. The remaining 50 percent of the total target payout opportunity, or 100 percent at the payout opportunity at maximum performance, of the performance share vesting is related to free cash flow, defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures. Adjustments can be made to free cash flow for merger and acquisition activities, non-operational businesses, significant expansions and other unusual items. The calibration of the pay-for-performance relationship for 2011 grants is as follows and payout is interpolated for performance between threshold, target and maximum levels:, 370368=2011 EMPI Plan Performance Measures. The EMPI Plan uses a \u0093performance scorecard\u0094 with multiple performance standards that are related to our annual business plan and strategic priorities in order to determine payouts under the plan., 249044=We generated record revenues of approximately $6.8 billion for 2011, up nearly 45 percent over 2010; and, 42729=Proxies. The Common Shares represented by properly authorized proxies will be voted as specified. It is intended that the Common Shares represented by proxies on which no specification has been made will be voted: FOR the election of the nominees for Director named herein or such substitute nominees as the Board of Directors may designate, FOR the amendment of our Regulations to add a provision to allow the Board to amend the Regulations without shareholder approval as permitted under Ohio law, FOR the resolution approving the compensation of our named executive officers, FOR the 2012 Incentive Equity Plan, FOR the 2012 Executive Management Performance Incentive Plan, FOR the ratification of Deloitte\u00a0& Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm and, at the discretion of the persons named as proxies, on all other matters that may properly come before the 2012 Annual Meeting., 283758=A summary of our 2011 select executive compensation policies and practices discussed above and further in this proxy statement are as follows:, 514996=Prior to 2012, full tax gross-up payments would have been provided on any excise taxes and cash paid in lieu of health and welfare benefits imposed upon any change in control payments. Effective January\u00a01, 2012, we entered into new change in control severance agreements with our executives. All elements of the severance agreements remained the, 128841=We have established Director Share Ownership Guidelines and assess each Director\u0092s compliance with the guidelines in December of each year. If a nonemployee Director meets the guidelines as of that assessment, the Director may elect to receive all or a portion of his or her annual retainer for the following year in cash. If the Director does not meet these guidelines, the Director is required to receive an equivalent value of a specified portion of the annual retainer in Common Shares until he or she meets the guidelines. Whether or not they are required to receive part of their retainer as Common Shares, nonemployee Directors may elect to receive up to 100 percent of their retainer and other fees in Common Shares. The cash portions of the annual retainers are paid quarterly, and Common Shares are issued at the beginning of the next fiscal year for the portion of each quarter\u0092s retainer that is paid in Common Shares. For those Directors who were required (or elected) to receive payment of their 2011 annual retainers in the form of Common Shares, $5,000 of the retainer paid for the first quarter of 2011 was paid in Common Shares, and $6,000 of the retainer for the remaining quarters of 2011 was paid in Common Shares., 94267=The Audit Committee reviews with our management, the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm, the adequacy and effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting; reviews significant accounting matters; reviews quarterly unaudited financial information prior to public release; approves the audited financial statements prior to public distribution; approves our assertions related to internal controls prior to public distribution; reviews any significant changes in our accounting principles or financial reporting practices; reviews, approves and retains the services performed by our independent registered public accounting firm; has the authority and responsibility to evaluate our independent registered public accounting firm; discusses with the independent registered public accounting firm their independence and considers the compatibility of non-audit services with such independence; annually selects and retains our independent registered public accounting firm to examine our financial statements; approves management\u0092s appointment, termination or replacement of the Chief Risk Officer; and conducts a legal compliance review at least annually. The members of the Audit Committee are independent under applicable SEC rules and the NYSE listing standards. Cliffs\u0092 Board identified Mr.\u00a0Riederer and Ms.\u00a0Henry as audit committee financial experts (as defined in Item\u00a0407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K of the SEC rules). No member of the Audit Committee serves on the audit committees of more than three public companies. The Audit Committee held 11 meetings during 2011. The charter of the Audit Committee is available at http://www.cliffsnaturalresources.com., 257757=Impact of Performance on 2011 Compensation, 501388=Deferred Compensation Plan. Under the Voluntary Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan in effect in 2011, or VNQDC Plan, the named executive officers and other senior executives, excluding non-U.S. executives, are permitted to defer, on a pre-tax basis, up to 50 percent of their base salary, all or a portion of their annual incentive under the EMPI Plan and their share award that may be payable as a long-term incentive award. The Compensation Committee believes the opportunity to defer compensation is a competitive benefit that addresses the goal of attracting and retaining talent. Additional detail is shown in the \u00932011 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Table\u0094., 312954=Based on its detailed evaluation of the compensation peer group used for the proxy analysis, Semler Brossy noted that, due to consolidation in the mining industry, the compensation peer group was becoming too small to draw meaningful conclusions on executive pay, and the focus of comparisons was being over-weighted by smaller coal mining companies. In addition, Semler Brossy noted that Cliffs\u0092 market capitalization, which reflects the margins, growth profile and expanding globalization of our business, was significantly higher than the market capitalization of many of the peers used in the 2010 analysis. As a result, Semler Brossy recommended, and the Compensation Committee approved, a significant adjustment to the criteria for selecting the compensation peer group for assessing 2011 compensation decisions. The Compensation Committee believed that the resulting new, expanded compensation peer group for 2011 more accurately reflected our business scale complexity and continued growth potential. The expanded compensation peer group also provided for a more robust data set that was less likely to be driven by individual outliers., 33937=Shareholders to be held on May\u00a08, 2012: The proxy statement and our 2011 Annual Report to, 101402=The Compensation Committee makes all decisions regarding the CEO\u0092s compensation, subject to ratification by the independent members of the Board, after consulting with its advisors in executive session where no management employees are present. For the other executive officers, the CEO is asked by the Compensation Committee to conduct and present an assessment on the achievement of specific goals established for those officers and on the performance of Cliffs taking into account external market forces and other considerations. While the CEO and Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer attend Compensation Committee meetings regularly by invitation, the Compensation Committee is the final decision maker for the compensation of the executive officers. For additional information regarding the operation of the Compensation Committee, see \u0093Executive Compensation\u0097Compensation Discussion and Analysis\u0094 beginning on page 20 of this proxy statement. The Compensation Committee held eight meetings during 2011. The charter of the Compensation Committee is available at http://www.cliffsnaturalresources.com., 920476=If the employee was hired prior to 1993, and in the case of Mr.\u00a0Gallagher, he or she will be entitled to retiree medical and life insurance for the rest of his or her life and the life of his or her spouse on the same terms as any other salaried employee hired prior to 1993; and, 255084=Achieving the rank of No.\u00a07 on the 2011 Barron\u0092s 500 America\u0092s Top Companies List;, 337798=During 2011, our executive compensation and benefits consisted of the components listed in the following table, which provides a brief description of the principal elements of compensation, how performance factors into each type of compensation and the objectives served by each element.
