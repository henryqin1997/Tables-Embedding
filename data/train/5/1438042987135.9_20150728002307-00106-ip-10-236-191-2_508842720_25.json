Surveys were sent to 2000 randomly selected people at Indiana University, Bloomington (400 faculty, 400 staff, 400 graduate students, and 800 undergraduate students). The questions on the survey are primarily Likert opinion scales (1-5 rating scales with 5 always being the most favorable rating). For questions asking opinions of services, the results shown include in order: the average opinion score (labeled \"Average\"), the percentage of people who were satisfied with the service (graded it as a 3 or better, labeled \"Satisfaction\"), the percentage of people who use the service (which we have taken to be the percentage of people who expressed an opinion about it, labeled \"Usage\").}",
