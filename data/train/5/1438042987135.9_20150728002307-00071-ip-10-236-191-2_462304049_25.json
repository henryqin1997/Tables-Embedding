By Slotting in Boktai 1, 2 or 3, the Samurai Statue in GargoyleCastle turns into an Otenko Statue, and the 100 Warrior wacking minigame turns into a 1000 bat wacking minigame for crossover points. Also, an Zoktai trader appears in Oran Area 2 to exchange your Crossover Points for chips, 58894=A easy way to make Zenny is during or after Cosmoman's liberation mission. Get NumberMan to search the 3 item panels straight ahead of the start point. You should get 1800 Zenny. Retreat and restart the mission. The item panels will be back, along with the 1800 Zenny. Repeat until you have all the zenny you need., 90426=After winning the End Area 5 Liberation Mission, there will be a gold Mr. Prog there who will recreate the battle. Talk to him and start the battle. Send a Navi to liberate the first item square and you should obtain 1800 Zennys. Next, retreat. You will leave the battle, however you will keep the 1800 Zennys.
