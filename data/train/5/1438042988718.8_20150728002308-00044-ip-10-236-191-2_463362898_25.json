Both systems involve a tagged known protein which can be paired with a library of unknown proteins, some of which may interact with the tagged protein. Interaction between the two proteins in the two hybrid system results in transcriptional activation of the yeast GAL1-lacZ gene which encodes enzymes for galactose utilisation and hence allows selection of the interacting clone on galactose-containing media. Interaction of the two proteins in the signal transfer system results in labelling of the unknown protein, e.g. phage-displayed antibody, peptide or other protein and hence recovery of that moiety. If phage-displayed antibody, peptide or other protein is the labelled (e.g biotinylated) element then rescue of the gene for the interacting protein is facilitated, since in phage display each phage particle contains-nucleic acid encoding the antibody, peptide or other protein it displays (see e.g. WO92/01047). Signal transfer selection is not confined to intracellular expression in yeast, and as such has many advantages over the yeast two-hybrid system., 132206=Each plate was centrifuged at 2000 rpm and the 100 \u03bcl supernatant from each well recovered and blocked in 20 \u03bcl 18% M6PBS stationary at room temperature for 1 hour. Meanwhile, flexible microtitre plates which had been incubated overnight stationary at 37\ufffd C. with either 50 \u03bcl 0.1 \u03bcg/ml of anti-CEA mouse Mab in PBS or 50 \u03bcl PBS alone, were washed 3 times in PBS and blocked for 2 h stationary at room temperature in 3MPBS. These plates were then washed three times with PBS and 50 \u03bcl preblocked soluble scFv added to each well of both the anti-CEA-mouse Mab-coated or uncoated plate. The plates were incubated stationary at 37\ufffd C. for 1 h after which the scFv solutions were poured off. The plates were washed by incubating for 2 min in PBST three times followed by incubating for 2 min in PBS three times, all at room temperature., 102457=CEA6 is a CEA specific scFv isolated from a large scFv. phage display library by panning on human CEA (Vaughan et al 1996). OP1 is a control scFv which recognises a 16 residue. peptide and does not bind to CEA. Phagemid particles expressing CEA6 or OP1 scFv's as a fusion proteins with the phage gIII protein were isolated as follows. 500 ml prewarmed (37\ufffd C.) 2YTAG (2TY media supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin and 2% glucose) in a 2 l conical flask was inoculated with approximately 3\ufffd1010 cells from a glycerol stock (\u221270\ufffd C.) of CEA6- or OP1-phagemid. The culture was grown at 37\ufffd C. with good aeration until the OD 600 nm reached 0.8. M13K07 helper phage (Stratagene) was added to the culture to a multiplicity of infection (moi) of approximately 10 (assuming that an OD 600 nm of 1 is equivalent to 5\ufffd108 cells per ml of culture. The culture was incubated stationary at 37\ufffd C. for 15 minutes followed by 45 minutes with light aeration (200 rpm) at the same temperature. The culture was centrifuged and the supernatant drained from the cell pellet. The cells were resusupended in 500 ml 2TYAK (2YT media supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin and 50 mg/ml kanamycin), and the culture incubated overnight at 30\ufffd C. with good aeration (300 rpm) Phage particles were purified and concentrated by three polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitations (Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., and Maniatis, T. (1990). Molecular Cloning\u2014A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbour, N.Y.) and resuspended in PBS to 1012 transducing units (tu)/ml., 233239=Approximately 1\ufffd105 CD4+ cells were spun onto poly-L-lysine subbed slides using a Cytospin (Serotech). Slides were blocked in MPBS for 2 hr at room temperature and a 1:10 dilution of the scFv in MPBS then incubated on the slides for 1 hr at room temperature. Slides were washed in PBS and detection was achieved using 1:100 dilution of 9E10, followed by a 1:500 dilution of anti-mouse-HRP, both diluted in MPBS and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature, with washing in PBS between incubations. CD4E1 and CD4D2 both gave clear staining of the cell membranes., 55660=Conveniently, a diverse population of binding molecules is provided displayed on the surface of a biological particle such as a virus, e.g. bacteriophage, each particle containing nucleic acid encoding the binding molecule displayed on its surface. WO92/01047 discloses in detail various formats for \u201cphage display\u201d of polypeptides and peptide binding molecules, such as antibody molecules, including scFv, Fab and Fv fragments, and enzymes, both monomeric and polymeric. Following labelling of phage displaying a target sbp member able to bind complementary ubp member of interest, and isolation of these from the reaction medium or milieu as discussed, nucleic acid may be recovered from phage particles. This nucleic acid may be sequenced if desired., 262156=Adult buffy coat blood from Cambridge Blood Transfusion Service was diluted 1:2 with Dulbeccos PBS (Tissue culture grade) then loaded onto 1077 density Ficoll Hypaque (Sigma). This was then spun at 1500 rpm for 30 min at room temperature with brake off. Cells at the interface were removed and washed once with PBS. Red cells were removed by using a whole blood erythrocyte lysing kit from R&D systems (Cat. no. WL1000). Cells were resuspended in 5 ml of lysing reagent and left for 5 min at room temperature then spun at 1000 rpm for 5 min and washed in 10 ml of wash reagent and again spun at 1000 rpm for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in PBS/0.5% BSA/2 mM EDTA (PBE) and then counted. In each of the following experiments 2.4\ufffd106 cells were used., 259521=Samples were analysed by flow cytometry and the fluorescence shifts overlayed, as shown in FIG. 5. As can be seen from the figure iteration of the biotin tyramine treament results in a 2.5 fold shift in the average fluorescence level of the cells. This is to expected given the observation that biotinylation may occurs over a range of up to 25 nm from the original site of HRP localisation. Assuming the first biotin tyramine treatment biotinylates proteins in a circle of radius 25 nm from the HRP, then this would give an area of biotinylation of \u03c0252 nm2, which is 1963 nm2. In the case of the second treatment with biotin tyramine the biotin deposited in this area is then saturated with streptavidin-HRP, so blocking binding of any streptavidin-FITC. The biotin tyramine treament is repeated giving a further area of biotinylation of \u03c0502\u2212\u03c0252, which is 5887 nm2, which is an area three times the size of the original circle of biotin deposition. This fits with the experimentally observed observed fluorscence shift of around 2.5 fold., 219810=Approximately 1\ufffd1013 phage were used per selection. 6 \u03bcg of 9E10-HRP conjugate were added to the peptide phage in a total volume of 1 ml PBS with 2% marvel (MPBS). Control selections were also carried out using 6 \u03bcg of unconjugated 9E10. All selections were carried out in 1 ml. Phage and antibody were allowed to bind overnight at 4\ufffd C. 50 \u03bcl 1M Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 4 \u03bcl biotin tyramine and 2 \u03bcl hydrogen peroxide were then added to the selection and allowed to react for 10 min at room temperature. 100 \u03bcl of streptavidin-coated magentic beads (Dynal) which had been preblocked for 30 min in MPBS were then added to the selection and rotated at room temperature for 30 min. Magnetic beads were then brought out of solution using a magnet and washed with 3\ufffd1 ml of PBS containing 0.1% Tween, followed by washing with 3\ufffd1 ml of PBS. The beads were resuspended in a final volume of 100 \u03bcl PBS and used to directly infect 5 ml of an exponentially growing culture of E. coli TG1. Infection was carried out by incubation stationary at 37\ufffd C. for 30 min, followed by 30 min slow shaking (200 rpm) at 37\ufffd C. Phage were plated out on 2TY medium containing 100 \u03bcg/ml tetracyclin (2TYT). Colony counts gave the phage titre., 225106=Individual colonies from the third round of selection were used to inoculate 96 well tissue culture plates containing 100 \u03bcl of 2TYT per well and clones were grown overnight at 30\ufffd C. with good aeration (300 rpm). Plates were centrifuged at 2000 rpm and the 100 \u03bcl from supernatant from each well was recovered and blocked in 20 \u03bcl 18% M6PBS (18% milk powder, 6\ufffdPBS) stationary at room temperature for 1 hour. ELISA plates which had been blocked overnight at 4\ufffd C. with 50 \u03bcl of 10 \u03bcg/ml 9E10, or 50 \u03bcl PBS alone were washed in PBS and then blocked for 2 hours stationary at 37\ufffd C. in 3MPBS ELISA plates were washed in PBS and the blocked phage supernatants then added to the ELISA plate. The plates were incubated stationary at room temperature, then washed three times with PBST, followed by three washes with PBS. 50 \u03bcl of anti-gene 8-HRP conjugate diluted at 1:5000 in 3MPBS were then added to each well and the plates incubate at room temperature for 1 hour. Plates were washed as before and the ELISA developed for 1 hour at room temperature with 50 \u03bcl of TMB substrate. Development was stopped by the addition of 25 \u03bcl of 1M H2SO4., 118834=Each plate was centrifuged at 2000 rpm and the 100 \u03bcl supernatant from each well recovered and blocked in 20 \u03bcl 18% M6PBS stationary at room temperature for 1 hour. Meanwhile, flexible microtitre plates which had been blocked overnight stationary at 37\ufffd C. with either 100 \u03bcl 0.5 \u03bcg/ml CEA in dH2O or 100 \u03bcl dH2O alone, were washed 3 times in PBS and blocked for 2 h stationary at room temperature in 3MPBS. These plates were then washed three times with PBS and 50 \u03bcl preblocked soluble scFv added to each well of both the CEA-coated or uncoated plate. The plates were incubated stationary at 37\ufffd C. for 1 h after which the scFv solutions were poured off. The plates were washed by incubating for 2 min in PBST three times followed by incubating for 2 min in PBS three times, all at room temperature., 258670=Ficoll purified cells (1\ufffd106 cells per sample) were incubated with anti-CD36 antibody for 30 min at room temperature, diluted (1:1000) in PBS/BSA. Cells were washed in PBS/BSA, and then incubated with an anti-mouse-HRP conjugate (1:1000 in PBS/BSA) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed as before, and then treated with biotin tyramine at 12.5 \u03bcg/ml. Samples which were to receive just one biotin tyramine treatment were then washed and incubated with streptavidin-FITC (1:1000 in PBS/BSA). The samples which received a further treament of biotin tyramine were incubated with streptavidin-HRP (1:1000 in PBS/BSA) for 30 min at room temperature, then washed and treated with biotin tyramine as before. Cells were washed again, and then incubated with streptavidin-FITC as before., 69420=Nucleic acid sequences encoding all or part of the gene and/or its regulatory elements can be readily prepared by the skilled person using the information and references contained herein and techniques known in the art (for example, see Sambrook, Fritsch and Maniatis, \u201cMolecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989, and Ausubel et al, Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons, 1992)., 263013=Cells (2.4\ufffd106) were incubated with mouse IgG1 anti human CD36 antibody (Immunotech 0765) (2 \u03bcg/105 cells) for 30 minutes at 4-8\ufffd C., washed in PBE and spun at 1000 rpm for 5 min. Incubation with goat anti-mouse HRP conjugated antibody (1:1000 dilution) was the same as for the anti CD36 antibody. All antibodies were diluted in PBE. Cell pellets were resuspended in 100 \u03bcl of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.4 with 2 \u03bcl biotin-tyramine (5 \u03bcg) and 1 \u03bcl of H2O2. This was left at room temperature for 10 minutes and then washed with 5 ml of PBE., 154909=100 \u03bcl of HRP-conjugated 31G9 (approximately 30 \u03bcg) was incubated on the TGF\u03b21-coupled BiaCore chip for 1 hour at room temperature. The chip was washed 3 times in PBST and 3 times in PBS and 1\ufffd1012 phage prepared from the human non-immunised library were then incubated on the chip surface for 1 hour at room temperature. The chip was washed as before and 100 \u03bcl of biotin tyramine mix (as described in Example 2 part bi) was incubated on the chip for 10 min at room temperature. The chip was washed as before and phage eluted from the chip using 200 \u03bcl of triethylaime TEA. The TEA was neutralised with 100 \u03bcl of 1M Tris-HCl pH 7.4., 115360=Colonies were scraped off the 243 mm\ufffd243 mm plates into 3 ml of 2TY broth and 15% (v/v) glycerol added for storage at \u221270C. Glycerol stock solutions from the first round of selection of the repertoire on the HeLa-CEA cells were rescued using helper phage to derive phagemid particles for the second round of selection. Phagemid particles were rescued from both first round selections carried out in the presence or in the absence of the marker anti-CEA Mab 250 \u03bcl of glycerol stock was used to inoculate 50 ml 2YTAG broth, and incubated in a 250 mL conical flask at 37\ufffd C. with good aeration until the OD600 nM reached 0.7 (approximately 2 hours). M13K07 helper phage (moi=10) was added to the culture which was then incubated stationary at 37\ufffd C. for 15 minutes followed by 45 minutes with light aeration (200 rpm) at the same temperature. The culture was centrifuged and the supernatant-drained from the cell pellet. The cells were resuspended in 50 ml prewarmed 2YTAR, and the culture incubated overnight at 30\ufffd C. with good aeration. Phage particles were purified and concentrated by PEG precipitation (Sambrook et al., 1990) and resuspended in PBS to 1013 tu/ml., 133058=To each well of both the mouse Mab-coated and the uncoated plate, 100 \u03bcl of a 1 in 200 dilution of biotinylated anti-myc-tag murine antibody 9E10 (Munro, S. & Pelham, H. R. B. (1986)Cell 46, 291-300) in 3MPBS was added and the plates incubated at 37\ufffd C. stationary for 1 h. Each plate was washed as described above. Plates were then incubated with alkaline-phosphatase-streptavidin complex (DAKO) diluted 1:1000 in dH2O. Plates were washed as described above followed by two rinses in 0.9% NaCl. Alkaline phosphatase activity was visualised using the chromogenic substrate pNPP (Sigma). The absorbance signal generated by each clone was assessed by measuring the optical density at 405 nm (pNPP) using a microtitre plate reader. Clones were scored for positive binders for the anti-CEA mouse Mab if the ELISA signal generated on the CEA-coated plate was at least double that on the uncoated plate., 131842=Cells from the master plates were used to inoculate fresh 96 well tissue culture plates containing 100 \u03bcl 2YTAG per well. These plates were incubated at 30\ufffd C. for a hours then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant eluted. Each cell pellet was resuspended in 100 \u03bcl 2YTA containing 10 mM IPTG and incubated at 30\ufffd C. overnight., 83834=The two-hybrid screen assay format is described by Fields and Song, 1989, Nature 340; 245-246. This type of assay format can be used in both mammalian cells and in yeast various combinations of Dlq binding domain and transcriptional activation domain are available in the art, such as the Lea LA binding domain and the VP60 transcriptional activation domain, and the GAL4 DNA binding domain and the GAL4 transcriptional activation domain. Suitable fusion constructs are produced for expression within the assay system. When screening for a susbstance able to modulate an interaction between two components, test substances (e.g. in a combinatorial peptide library) may be expressed from a third construct., 204535=Phage were diluted to an approximate concentration of 2\ufffd1010 per ml in a total volume of 500 \u03bcl. 5 \u03bcl of mouse Mab directed agains the gene 3 protein were then added to the phage and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. 5 ml of an anti-mouse-IgG-HRP conjugate (Sigma) were then added to the phage and incubated at room temperature for a further 1 hour. The phage were then treated with biotin tyramine by adding 50 \u03bcl of 1M Tris-HCl pH 7.4 to the phage mix, followed by 4 \u03bcl of biotin tyramine stock solution and 2 \u03bcl of hydrogen peroxide (Sigma). The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 10 minutes, and the biotinylated phage then stored at 4\ufffd C. overnight., 218449=In this example, the peptide library used was constructed as described by Fisch et al (I. Fisch et al (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93 7761-7766) to give a phage display library of 1\ufffd1013 independent clones., 249489=CD4+ cells were purified as described in Example 9. CD4E1 phage, or phage from a CD4+ binding clone (CLA4) were prepared as described in Example 12. 1\ufffd106 cells were incubated for 1 hr with 5 ng of biotinylated MIP-1\u03b1, or 5 ng of biotinylated VCAM in a total volume of 100 \u03bcl PBS/BSA Streptavidin-HRP (1:1000 dilution in PBS/BSA) was then added to the cells and incubated for 30 min. Cells were washed in PBS, and then 1011 phage added in PBS/BSA and allowed to bind to the cells for 1 hr at room temperature. Cells were washed in PBS and then treated with biotin tyramine as described before. Cells were washed in PBS and then lysed in PBS containing 0.1% Tween and biotinylated phage were captured on streptavidin-coated. Beads were washed three times in PBST and three times in PBS, then infected directly into an exponentially growing culture of E coli TG1., 205321=EM grids were blocked in 0.1% gelatin and phage samples then applied. The phage were then labelled with streptavidin-5 nm colloidal gold (Sigma) at an approximate concentration of 2\ufffd1011 particles per ml. A number of images of the biotinylated ends of phages were generated. When the anti-gene 3 antibody was omitted no gold labelling of the phage ends could be observed., 111175=The phage antibody repertoire above was selected for antibodies to CEA. The \u2018large\u2019 scFv repertoire was treated as follows in order to rescue phagemid particles. 500 ml prewarmed (37\ufffd C.) 2YTAG (2YT media supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin and 2% glucose) in a 2 l conical flask was inoculated with approximately 3\ufffd1010 cells from a glycerol stock (\u221270\ufffd C.) culture of the library. The culture was grown at 37\ufffd C. with good aeration until the OD600 nm reached 0.7 (approximately 2 hours). M13K07 helper phage (Stratagene) was added to the culture to a multiplicity of infection (moi) of approximately 10 (assuming that an OD600 nm of 1 is equivalent to 5\ufffd108 cells per ml of culture) The culture was incubated stationary at 37\ufffd C. for 15 minutes followed by 45 minutes with light aeration (200 rpm) at the same temperature. The culture was centrifuged and the supernatant drained from the cell pellet. The cells were resuspended in 500 ml 2YTAX (2YT media supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin and 50 \u03bcg/ml kanamycin), and the culture incubated overnight at 30\ufffd C. with good aeration (300 rpm). Phage particles were purified and concentrated by three polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitations (Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., & Maniatis, T. (1990). Molecular Cloning\u2014A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbour, N.Y.) and resuspended in PBS to 1012 transducing units (tu)/ml (ampicillin resistant clones)., 245041=The rat gene CL-6 was identified by R. H. Diamond et al. (1993, Journal of Biological Chemistry 268, 15185-15192) as a gene which was induced in regenerating liver and insulin-treated Reuber H35 cells, a rat hepatoma cell line which grows in response to physiological concentration of insulin and retains some properties of regenerating liver. CL-6 was one of a panel of 41 novel growth response genes identified in this study, and was found to be the most abundant insulin-induced gene CL-6 is induced as an immediate-early gene in the liver cells, and its immediate-early induction during liver regeneration suggests that it is regulated by early stimuli, and not by insulin alone. CL-6 mRNA expression was found to be highest in liver and kidney, but showed some expression in most tissues. The CL-6 protein is predicted to be highly hydrophobic, and may be a membrane-associated protein. CL-6 is likely to have a role in the tissue-specific aspects of cellular growth, involved in the maintenance of normal liver architecture or metabolism during regeneration and foetal development., 214707=Cells from the master plate were used to inoculate fresh 96 well tissue culture plates containing 100 \u03bcl 2TYGA per well. These plates were incubated at 37\ufffd C. for 6-8 hr. M13K07 was added to each well to an moi of 10 and incubated stationary for 30 min then 30 min with gentle shaking (100 rpm), both at 37\ufffd C. The plates were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant removed. Each cell pellet was resuspended in 100 \u03bcl 2TYAK and incubated at 30\ufffd C. overnight. Each plate was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min and the 100 \u03bcl of supernatant was recovered and blocked in 20 \u03bcl 18% M6PBS (18% skimmed milk powder, 6\ufffdPBS), stationary at room temperature for 1 hr., 134833=Thawed HeLa-CEA slides which had been rehydrated in PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature were incubated for 15 minutes with streptavidin in PBS at 5 \u03bcg/ml. Slides were washed four times in PBS and then incubated for 15 minutes with in PBS at 10 \u03bcg/ml. Slides were washed 4 times in PBS and then incubated in block consisting of 1% BSA PBS containing 10% normal mouse serum for 30 minutes. Block was removed and the slides then incubated with CEA6 purified phage (as described in Example 1) at approximately 1\ufffd1010 per ml in 1% PBS-BSA overnight at 4\ufffd C. Control slides were incubated under the same conditions with purified fluorescein-binding phage which do not recognise CEA. Slides were moved back to room temperature and washed in PBST for 10 minutes, followed by incubation with 9E10-biotin at 3 \u03bcg/ml diluted in 1% BSA-PBS-for 1 hour. Washing was carried out for 10 minutes in PBST and the slides then- incubated with ABC-HRP (DAKO) diluted 1:100 in PBS for 30 minutes. Slides were either developed at this point or washed three times in PBST, then incubated in either with biotinylated tyramine in 50 mM Tris-NCl pH 7.4 containing 0.03% H2O2 for 10 minutes. Three PBST washes were carried out and the slides then incubated with the ABC-HRP complex again for 30 minutes. Slides were developed using carbazole. Carbozole was prepared freshly by dissolving 9-amino-ethyl-carbozole (Sigma) at 60 mg per 25 ml DMF then adding 100 \u03bcl of this to 1 ml sodium acetate pH5.2. 5 \u03bcl of 30% H2O2 was then added and 100 \u03bcl of this mix added to each slide chamber. Development was left for 20 minutes and then the carbazole washed off with dH2O., 212830=The population of biotinylated phage which had been recovered from the first stage of the selection was added directly to 1\ufffd106 CD4+ lymphocytes in a total volume of 200 \u03bcl in MPBS. Phage were allowed to bind to the cells for 1 hr at room temperature, and cells were then washed 3 times in 1 ml PBS. Cells were pelleted at 4000 rpm for 2 min in a minifuge between washes. A further aliquot of the scFv phage library (2\ufffd1012 phage) was then added to the cells in 1 ml MPBS and allowed to bind for 1 hr at room temperature. Cells were washed 3 times in PBS as above and then resuspended in 200 \u03bcl MPBS containing 2 \u03bcl of streptavidin-HRP complex (Amersham). This was allowed to bind for 30 min at room temperature, and cells were then washed as before. Biotin tyramine treatment of the cells was carried out as described in Example 9 part b). Cells were then lysed by resuspension in 100 \u03bcl PBST and 30 \u03bcl preblocked streptavidin-coated Dynal beads were added to the lysate. Beads and lysate were rotated at room temperature for 20 min, and the beads then taken out of solution on a magnet. Beads were washed 3 times in 1 ml PBST, followed by 3 times in 1 ml PBS. Washed beads were used to directly infect an exponentially growing culture of E coli TG1. A total of around 4\ufffd103 clones were recovered from this selection procedure., 198933=Sialyl Lewis X (Oxford Glycosystems) was biotinylated using biotinylated diaminopyridine (BAP). 1 mg BAP was dissolved in 50 \u03bcl pyridine/acetic acid (2:1 v/v). This was added directly to the dry carbohydrate (100 \u03bcg) and incubated for 1 hour at 80\ufffd C. The oligosaccharide-BAP adducts were reduced by the addition of 50 \u03bcl of 2.1M/l borane dimethylamine in pyridine/acetic acid and vortexed. Incubation was then carried on for a further hour at 80\ufffd C., 116558=Phage recovered from the selection in the presence of the anti-CEA mouse Mab underwent a second round selection with either no Mab, or with a 1:100, or a 1:1000 dilution of the anti-CEA Mab. Phage recovered from the first round of selection in the absence of the anti-CEA Mab underwent a second round of selection, again in the absence of the anti-CEA Mab. The selections were carried out on the HeLa-CEA cells as described for the first round of selection. The total numbers of phage present in the eluates and recovered by streptavidin capture are shown in Table 2., 27469=This application is a divisional of U.S. Ser. No. 08/889,291 filed on Jul. 8, 1997, U.S. Pat. No. 5,994,519., 118470=Cells from the master plates were used to inoculate fresh 96 well tissue culture plates containing 100 \u03bcl 2YTAG per well. These plates were-incubated at 30\ufffd C. for 8 hours then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant eluted. Each cell pellet was resuspended in 100 \u03bcl 2YTA containing 10 mM IPTG and incubated at 30\ufffd C. overnight., 185570=1\ufffd105 CD4+ lymphocytes were prepared as described in Example 9 part a and incubated with 2\ufffd1012 phage prepared from the 1.4\ufffd1010 scFv phage dsiplay library in either the presence or absence of biotinylated MIP-1\u03b1 (R and D Systems) at a final concentration of 375 nM. The final volume for each selection was made up 40 \u03bcl with PBS containing 2% marvel (MPBS). Selections were incubated for 14 hr at 4\ufffd C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 600 g for 3 min, and washed in 1 ml MPBS. A total of three washes were carried out. Cells were then incubated in the dark for 30 min with 500 mM streptavidin-conjugated SAND. Cells were washed as before, the exposed to 5 flashes of light from a standard flashgun. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 100 \u03bcl TE containing 0.5% triton., 256412=CD4+ lymphocytes were purified as described in Example 9. Cells were incubated with the anti-CD4+ antibody (Sigma), at a dilution of 1:1000 in PBS/BSA. Cells were washed in PBS, and then either of the two second antibodies (anti-mouse-FITC, or anti-mouse-HRP) were added to the cells, at a dilution of 1:1000 in PBS/BSA. 1\ufffd105 cells were used per sample. Cells were washed in PBS and either detected directly (anti-mouse-FITC), or treated with biotin tyramine as described previously. Biotin tyramine was added over a range of concentrations from 0.25 \u03bcg/ml up to 100 \u03bcg/ml, in order co determine the concentration at which the optimal signal enhancement occurred. After biotin tyramine treatment cells were again washed in PBS, then streptavidin-FITC was added at a diltuion of 1:1000 in PBS. Cells were analysed by flow cytometry., 170753=1\ufffd105 CD4+ lymphocytes were incubated with 2\ufffd1012 phage prepared from the 1.4\ufffd1010 scFv phage display library in either the presence or absence of biotinylated MIP-1\u03b1 (R and D Systems) at a final concentration of 375 nM. The final volume for each selection was made up 40 \u03bcl with PES containing 2% marvel (MPBS). Selections were incubated for 14 hr at 4\ufffd C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 600 g for 3 min, and washed in 1 ml MPBS. A total of three washes were carried out. 100 \u03bcl of streptavidin-HRP was added at a dilution of 1:1000 in MPBS. This was incubated for 2 hr, then washed as before. Biotin tyramine was then added (as Example 2, part bi) in 100 \u03bcl of 150 mM NaCl/50 mM TrisHCl pH 7.4 containing 3% H2O2 and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed and resuspended in 100 \u03bcl TE containing 0.5% triton. Biotinylated phage were captured on 10 \u03bcl of MPBS-blocked streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynal). The beads were washed three times in 1 ml PBS/0.1% Tween 20 (PBST), then resuspended in 100 \u03bcl of PBS. Phage eluate before and after streptavidin capture were titred by infection of an exponentially growing culture of E coli TG1 at 37\ufffd C. for 1 hr. The numbers of phase recovered from the various selection procedures are shown below., 156539=Colonies were scraped off the 243 mm\ufffd243 mm plates into 3 ml of 2TY broth and 15% (v/v) glycerol added for storage at \u221270C. Glycerol stock solutions from the first round of selection of the repertoire on the TGF\u03b21-BiaCore chip were rescued using helper phage to derive phagemid particles for the second round of selection. 250 \u03bcl of glycerol stock was used to inoculate 50 ml 2YTAG broth, and incubated in a 250 mL conical flask at 37\ufffd C. with good aeration until the OD600 nM reached 0.7 (approximately 2 hours). M13K07 helper phage (moi=10) was added to the culture which was then incubated stationary at 37\ufffd C. for 15 minutes followed by 45 minutes with light aeration (200 rpm) at the same temperature. The culture was centrifuged and the supernatant drained from the cell pellet. The cells were resuspended in 50 ml prewarmed 2YTAK, and the culture incubated overnight at 30\ufffd C. with good aeration. Phage particles were purified and concentrated by PEG precipitation (Sambrook et al., 1990) and resuspended in PBS to 1013 tu/ml., 137319=HeLa-CEA expressing cells grown in chamber flasks were blocked in MPBS for 2 hours at room temperature. 100 \u03bcl of an anti-CEA mouse Mab was then incubated on the-slides at a dilution of 1:100 in MPBS. for 1 hour at room temperature. Control incubations were carried out in MPBS without the presence of the anti-CEA Mab. Slides were washed three times in PBST followed by three washes in PBS. 100 \u03bcl of of a goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated second antibody (Pierce) was then added at a dilution of 1:2500 in MPBS and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Washing was carried out as before and 100 \u03bcl of biotinylated tyramine in 50 mM tris-HCl pH 7.4 with 0.03% H2O2 was added to each slide chamber for 10 minutes at room temperature. Cells were then scraped off the slides. Cells were pelleted at 600 rpm for 5 minutes and then resuspended in 10 mM triethanolamine, 1% triton in saline. Cells were left on ice for 10 minutes, then cell nuclei were pelleted at 13000 rpm in a minifuge for 5 minutes at 4\u2032 C. Supernatants were added to reducing protein loading buffer. and run on 10-15% SDS gradient PHAST gels. Protein were transferred to Hybond Cextra (Amersham) membranes using the PHAST system programme at 70\ufffd C. for 30 minutes. Membranes were blocked for 2 hours in MPBS and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with either a strepavidin-HRP complex, or an anti-CEA mouse Mab. Blots probed with the anti-CEA mab were washed three times in PBST followed by three washes in PBS. then incubated with an anti-mouse-HRP-conjugated antibody at a diltuion of 1:2500 in MPBS for 1 hour at room temperature. Blots were washed as before and developed using the ECL (Amersham) detection kit., 197288=RK1, which was a clone generate by biotin tyramine signal transfer selection using MIP-1\u03b1 as a guide molecule was identical to RK-3, with the exception of a single amino acid difference in the VL CDR3. This demonstrates the selectivity of the selection procedures; a virtually identical clone recognising the same CC-CKR5 region can be selected by either biotin tyramine or light activatible-streptavidin signal transfer selection from a background of 1.4\ufffd1010 other clones., 237313=For immunoscreening host cells (Y1090) were infected with phage from the library and plated out on L top agarose. After 3.5 hours growth at 42\ufffd C., the plates were overlaid with nitrocellulose filters saturated with 10 mM IPTG, an inducer of Lac Z gene expression, and incubated for a further 3.5 hours at 37\ufffd C. During this time, the plaques are transferred to the filter along with the \u03b2-galactosidase fusion proteins, released from the lytically infected cells. The filters were carefully removed and washed briefly in PBS and then blocked in MPBST. Detection of positives was by sequential incubations with scFv of interest at a concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml in MPBS, followed by 9E10 (1:100 in MPBS) and then an anti-mouse HRP congugate (1:1000 in MPBS). The filters were washed between incubations in 3 changes of PBST. Signal was detected using an Enhanced Chemiluminescent system (Amersham ECL Kit). Plaques which were found to be positive from the first round of screening were picked and re-infected into a fresh culture of Y1090, and the screening process repeated. This was carried out to ensure the reproducibility of the positive signal and to obtain clonal plaques., 177444=Selected phage were analysed by phage ELISA for their ability to recognise CD4+ lymphocytes, a CC-CKR5 transfected cell line (provided by M. Parmentier and G. Vassart, University of Brussels) and a BSA-conjugated peptide corresponding to the amino terminal twenty amino acids of the CC-CKR5 receptor (MDYQVSSPIYDINYYTSEPC). Phage ELISAs were carried out as follows: individual clones were picked into a 96 well tissue culture plate containing 100 \u03bcl 2YTAG. Plates were incubated at 37\ufffd C. for 6 hours. M13K07 helper phage was added to each well to an moi of 10 and incubated with gentle shaking for 45 min at 37\ufffd C. The plates were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant removed. Cell pellets were resuspended in 100 \u03bcl 2TYA with kanamycin (50 \u03bcg/ml) and incubated at 30\ufffd C. overnight. The ELISA was then carried out as for soluble ELISA (Example 2) except that in place of the 9E10 a goat anti-M13 antibody was used at a dilution of 1:2500, followed by an anti-goat alkaline phosphatase conjugate, also at a dilution of 1:2500. 1\ufffd105 cells per ELISA well were used and the peptide BSA conjugate was coated at a concentration of 1 \u03bcg/ml., 112862=Two rounds of selection using phage prepared from a large non-immunised human scFv library were carried out on slides of CEA-expressing ReLa cells. 5\ufffd1011 phage were allowed to bind to the cells in the presence or absence of an anti-CEA mouse Mab (Zymed) at a dilution of 1:100 in MPBS in a total volume of 100 \u03bcl, at 4\ufffd C. overnight. Slides were washed three times in PBST followed by three times in PBS. A secondary anti-mouse hydrogen-peroxidase-conjugated antibody which recognised the primary mouse anti-CEA antibody was then incubated on the sections at a dilution of 1:2500 in MPBS in a total volume of 100 \u03bcl at room temperature for 1 hour. washing was carried out as before and 100 \u03bcl of biotinylated-tyramine in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 with 0.03% H2O2 was added to each slide chamber for 10 minutes at room temperature. Chambers were washed as above and phase were eluted using 200 \u03bcl triethylamine (TEA). TEA was neutralised with 100 \u03bcl of 1M Tris-HCl pH 7.4., 34574=Other display systems may be used instead of display on filamentous bacteriophage. Such systems include display on whole bacterial cells or modified bacterial surface structures (Osuna et al. Crit. Rev. Microbiol., 1994, 20: 107-116; Lu et al., BioTechnology, 1995, 13: 366-372) and eukaryotic viruses (Boublik et al. BioTechnology, 1995, 13: 1079-1084; Sugiyama et al., FEBS Lett., 1995, L 359: 247-250). Bacteriophage display libraries may be generated using fusion proteins with the gene III protein (e.g. Vaughan et al. Nature Biotechnology, 1996, 14: 309-314), or the major gene VIII coat protein (Clackson and Wells, Trends Biotechnol., 1994, 12: 173-184), or the gene VI protein (Jespers et al., BioTechnology, 1995, 13: 378-382)., 203414=An oestradiol-binding phage (MT31C) was grown from a bacterial glycerol stock in 50 ml 2TY/2% glucose/1 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin (2TYGA) for 6 hours at 37\ufffd C. M13K07 helper phage (Stratagene) was added to the culture to a multiplicity of infection (moi) of approximately 10 (assuming that an OD 600 mm of 1 is equivalent to 5\ufffd108 cells per ml of culture). The culture was incubated stationary at 37\ufffd C. for 15 minutes followed by 45 minutes with light aeration (200 rpm) at the same temperature. The culture was centrifuged and the supernatant drained from the cell pellet. The cells were resuspended in 50 ml 2TYAK (2TY media supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin and 50 \u03bcg/ml kanamycin), and the culture incubated overnight at 30\ufffd C. with good aeration (300 rpm). Phage particles were purified and concentrated by two polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitations (Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., and Maniatis, T. (1990). Molecular Cloning\u2014A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbour, N.Y.) and resuspended in PBS to 1012 transducing units (tu)/ml., 141931=Cells were washed with PBS and the cells were then incubated overnight at 4\ufffd C. in 200 \u03bcl of PBS/1% BSA in the presence of 1\ufffd1012 phage prepared from a large non-immunised human scFv library. To one culture well a 1:20 dilution of the HRP-conjugated polyclonal anti-E selectin IgG was also added to the phage. Cells were washed three times in 0.5 ml PBST and three times in PBS. 200 \u03bcl of the biotin tyramine mix (as in Example 2 part bi) was added to each well and left for 10 minutes at room temperature. Cells were washed as before and the phage then eluted in 200 ml triethylamine (TEA) for 10 minutes at room temperature. The TEA was then neutralized with 100 \u03bcl of 1M TrisHCl pH7.4., 104775=HeLa-CEA slides were incubated overnight at 4\ufffd C. with 100 \u03bcl phage in the presence or absence of an anti-CEA mouse Mab (Zymed) at a range of dilutions from 1:100 to 1:10000 in 3% marvel PBS (MPBS). Phage imput values were around 5\ufffd1011 per ml for CEA-purified phage. Control incubations were carried out in parallel using a phage preparation of OP1 in the presence of the anti-CEA Mab. 100 \u03bcl of phage were used per chamber of the slide. Slide chambers were washed 3 times in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST), followed by 3 washes with PBS. Each wash was left for 2 minutes before being changed. 100 \u03bcl of a goat anti-mouse HRP second antibody (Pierce) was then added at a dilution in MPBS of 1:2500 and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Control incubations were carried out for the same length of time incubating with PBS alone. Washing was carried out as before and 100 \u03bcl of BT in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 with 0.03% H2O2 was added to each slide chamber for 10 minutes at room temperature. Control incubations were carried out as above, but with the omission of the BT. Chambers were washed as above and phage were then eluted using 200 \u03bcl triethylamine (TEA). TEA was neutralised with 100 \u03bcl of 1M Tris-HCl pH 7.4. 10 \u03bcl of this eluted phage was used to directly infect an exponentially growing culture of E coli TGl. Infected cells were grown for 1 hour at 37\ufffd C. with light aeration in 2YT broth, and then plated on 2TYAG medium. A series of dilutions of bacteria were plated out and incubated at 30\ufffd C. overnight. Colony counts gave the phage titre. The results are shown in Table 1., 91304=Biotinylated phage may then be specifically recovered using streptavidin coated magnetic beads and hence phase which bind in close proximity to the existing mouse Mab are enriched for. The half life of the biotin-tyramine phenolic free radical is very short, so deposition occurs extremely close to the activating enzyme (Bobrow et al., supra). When CARD is used as an amplification system to enhance signal in immunocytochemistry no detectable loss of image resolution is apparent, indicating that deposition occurs in close association with the catalytic enzyme (Adams, J. C.(1992) J. Histochem. and Cytol. 40: 1457-1463). The area over which the signal transfer occurs may be increased or decreased by modifying the viscosity or temperature of the solution in which the reaction is carried out, or by adding excess unbiotinylated tyramine., 109988=Polyadenylated RNA was prepared from the B-cells of various lymphoid tissues of 43 non-immunised donors using the \u201cQuickprep mRNA Kit\u201d (Pharmacia). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from mRNA using a \u201cFirst-strand cDNA synthesis\u201d kit (Pharmacia) using random hexamers to prime synthesis. V-genes were amplified using family-specific primers for VH, V\u03ba and V\u03bb genes as previously described (Marks et al., (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 222:581-597) and subsequently recombined together with the (Gly4, Ser)3 scFv linker by PCR assembly. The VH-linker-VL antibody constructs were cloned into the Sfi I and Not I sites of the phagemid vector, pCANTAB 6. Ligation, electroporation and plating out of the cells was as described previously (Marks et al, supra). The library was made ca. 1000\ufffd larger than that described previously by bulking up the amounts of vector and insert used and by performing multiple electroporations. This generated a scFv repertoire that was calculated to have ca. 1.3\ufffd1010 individual recombinants which by Bst NI fingerprinting were shown to be extremely diverse., 57768=Suitable vectors can be chosen or constructed, containing appropriate regulatory sequences, including promoter sequences, terminator fragments, polyadenylation sequences, enhancer sequences, marker genes and other sequences as appropriate. Vectors may be plasmids, viral e.g. phage, or phagemid, as appropriate.
