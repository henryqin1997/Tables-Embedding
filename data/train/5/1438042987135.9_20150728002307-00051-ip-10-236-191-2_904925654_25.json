From what I hear, Butte College offers the best fire academy in the state of California. To hear that makes me proud to know that I will one day be a first class fire fighter to graduate from a prestigious academy., 127655=Lots of financial aid available, there is even a scholarship office. I joke that you don't need financial aid because the cost of the college itself is so cheap: less than $1500 per semester.}",
