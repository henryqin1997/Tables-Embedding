            "Bring your ax and learn which end is right (and don't be left). You don't need to read music ... but we won't hold it against you if you can! We'll discuss the local music scene, point to some things to work on, and practice some basic moves and tactics. And we WILL learn a tune. As always: a handout to take home!",
            "Workshop for whistle beginners. In one hour, play a few tunes. Have lots of fun.",
            "Members of old-time bands may think that clawhammer banjo tunings are intended solely to irritate people who play less idiosyncratic instruments. While that is largely the case, they also enable us banjo players to negotiate some old-time tunes with elegance and efficiency. This is especially true of the focus of this workshop, \"double-C\" based G tunings, which make otherwise awkward tunes very enjoyable to play. A number of common G tunes will provide proof of concept.",
            "If you can tap a tune out on a table top, then you can play hammered dulcimer. Come check out this many-stringed instrument, and see how fun it is to play!",
            "(Note: Teacher change from Alex Hastings to Scott Ware) Come learn to play harmonica with Scott Ware, a local Celtic and folk musician. It's easy and fun, and almost as annoying as accordion! Bring a harmonica in the key of C, or buy an inexpensive one from one of our festival vendors before the workshop.",
