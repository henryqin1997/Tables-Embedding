    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{11578=Just about 88% of professors at Seton Hall have a Ph.D. So your learning from the best of the best. The class ratio of student to professor is 14:1. So the professor knows who you are; your not just a regular student he/she collects their money from. Every professor has office hours and ALWAYS expect their kids to go to their office hours. The professor's are there to help you! If you don't take advantage of it you really don't know how lucky you can be. Even if you dont understand the professor and need EXTRA help. Shu has an academic resource center (ARC). There they have tutors for just about all subjects. We have a writing center; where there are students or english professors helping you with your papers. We even have tutoring in the residences hall., these tutors are willing to work around your schedule. SO there is NO way you can do bad in your classes unless if you dont really try !, 361080=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 43464=As a Freshman from out of state, I was fairly worried about attending a school in which I knew no one. To ease the worry Freshman undergo, Seton Hall set up a Pirate Weekend. During Pirate Weekend in late June, enrolled Freshmen can tour the campus with more detail, spend a night in the dorms, and (best of all) get to meet their new classmates. Although there were a lot of new people to get acquainted with, I met two wonderful girls during that time who remain my closest friends on campus today!, 10811=Student life is what you make it. If you join Organizations on campus you will have a great time. We have 14 NCAA Division I Varisity, and our Baseball team just won THE BIG EAST CONFERENCE. So the school is going to be pretty crazy when we get back to Fall 2011. We have 100+ Organizations on campus. There is a huge variety so TRUST ME when i tell you, you will find the prefect organization for you. We also have 27 Greek Societies, which is what makes the school amazing.}",

There are so many types of people Tips for prospective students Always make an appointment for anything the school is horrible with walk ins. Sometime thy make you wait forever just to tell you they cant help you. Be outgoing get to know people Bang for the buck They do give you a lot of free stuff. Its not totally free you are paying to go to a private school which means expensive. They have a lot of people to help you too. Am enjoying being here I like the school there is always something to do and your only a short train ride from the city. And the people are pretty nice. Am learning a lot",
