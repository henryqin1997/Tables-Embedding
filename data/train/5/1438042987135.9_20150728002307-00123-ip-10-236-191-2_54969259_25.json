    "textBeforeTable": "Relativistic wave equations If nothing else, this list is a nice reminder of the mysterious ubiquity of a constant involving the diameter and circumference of a circle in all aspects of physics and higher math. Below are all the expressions that included \u03c0, plus the detected constant factor. The headings point to the Wikipedia pages from which the equations were taken. Equations I call this a straight win for Tau - the vast majority of expressions using \u03c0 (119 of 133) are preceded by even integer constants. I found a total of 3173 equations, of which 133 contained the symbol \u03c0. Of these 133 equations, the distribution of constant factors preceding \u03c0 looked like this: Results Of course, anyone of sound judgement will disregard what follows entirely, due to the many obvious shortcomings of this procedure and its underlying assumptions. Readers of my blog, on the other hand, may find the results interesting. I wrote a small script to crawl all the articles linked to from the Wikipedia List of Equations page. For each page, I extracted all mathematical expressions, and checked the LaTeX source of each for occurances of the symbol \u03c0. A little bit of light parsing was then done to check if the symbol was directly preceded by an integer constant. Finally, I rendered the LaTeX source back to images to produce the equation tables below. Methodology Disregarding for the moment any conceptual elegance or expanatory power that Tau might have, I",
