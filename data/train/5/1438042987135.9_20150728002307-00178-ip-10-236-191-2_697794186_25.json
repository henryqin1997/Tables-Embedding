(A Development Stage Company) as of December 31, 2011 and the related statement of operations, stockholders\u0092 deficit and cash flows for the period from February 23, 2011 (inception) through December 31, 2011. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit., 558272=As of September 30, 2012, the Company had 111,570,000 shares of its common stock issued and outstanding., 551127=The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes. \u00a0Under FASB ASC 740-10-25, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the bases of certain assets and liabilities for income tax and financial reporting purposes. \u00a0The deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified according to the financial statement classification of the assets and liabilities generating the differences., 705645=The Company provided a valuation allowance equal to the deferred income tax assets for the period from February 23, 2011 (inception) to December 31, 2011 because it is not presently known whether future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize the tax loss carryforwards., 709711=In August 2009, FASB issued an amendment to the accounting standards related to the measurement of liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis. \u00a0This standard clarifies how a company should measure the fair value of liabilities and that restrictions preventing the transfer of a liability should not be considered as a factor in the measurement of liabilities within the scope of this standard. \u00a0This standard is effective for the Company on October 1, 2009. The adoption of this amendment did not have a material effect on the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements., 230997=2012, 708882=In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance now codified as ASC 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as the single source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, aside from those issued by the SEC. ASC 105 does not change current U.S. GAAP, but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative U.S. GAAP by providing all authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place. \u00a0The adoption of ASC 105 did not have a material impact on the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements, but did eliminate all references to pre-codification standards., 285037=On November 27, 2012 we issued Taurus an additional 19,500,000 restricted shares of our common stock as required by provisions within the consulting agreement. \u00a0These shares were valued at $0.15 a share, which was the closing price of our common on the date of issue. \u00a0Hence, the aggregate value of this issuance to Taurus was $2,925,000., 159251=In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08 \u0093Intangibles \u0096 Goodwill and Other\u0094. \u00a0This new guidance on testing goodwill provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. \u00a0If an entity determines that this is the case, it is required to perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any). \u00a0If an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. \u00a0ASU 2011-08 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011 with prospective application required. \u00a0The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows., 719058=On February 22, 2012, we issued 1,000,000 shares of restricted common stock, $0.0001 par value, to Kyung Lee in exchange for $10,000, or $0.01 per share., 219692=The following table sets forth information with respect to compensation paid by us to our officers from inception on February 23, 2011 through December 31, 2012 . \u00a0Our fiscal year end is December 31. \u00a0No compensation has been paid to our officers from inception on February 23, 2011 through December 31, 2012 . \u00a0We have no plans to begin paying our officers any cash compensation during the current fiscal year ending December 31, 2013 ., 92778=An application for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board was submitted by a market maker who agreed to sponsor the security and who demonstrated compliance with Rule 15c2-11 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u0093Exchange Act\u0094). \u00a0The application for quotation of our registered common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board was accepted on September 11, 2012. \u00a0We also caused a different market maker to submit an application in September 2012 on our behalf to the Depository Trust Corporation (\u0093DTC\u0094) to become eligible for electronic trading (\u0093DTC Eligible\u0094). \u00a0We are currently approved for DTC electronic trading., 735569=Osmar E. Chanquin, 549743=As of September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011 we believe that the recorded values of all of our financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations., 727067=On February 23, 2011, we issued 5,000,000 shares of common stock to Taurus Financial Partners, LLC in consideration of its services of assisting with the creation and early development of our business, the preparation of this registration statement on Form S-1, and continued EDGAR filing services. \u00a0We valued these services at $50,000, or $0.01 a share. \u00a0In connection with this issuance, we relied upon the exemption from the registration requirements pursuant to the provisions of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act as a transaction by an issuer not involving any public offering. \u00a0By virtue of its relationship to us, Taurus Financial Partners had access to all relevant information relating to our business and represented that it had the required investment intent. \u00a0In addition, the securities issued bore an appropriate restrictive legend., 135973=J. Scott Sitra has voting and dispositive power of the securities held by the Selling Stockholder. These shares were received as compensation for services related to our going public initiative and ongoing SEC filing requirements. Of the shares being sold, 5,000,000 were issued on February 23, 2011 and 9,500,000 were issued on November 27, 2012. These issuances and this relationship is described further in \u0093Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Corporate Governance\u0094 on page 32., 85320=As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses, and we are subject to the SEC\u0092s rules and regulations relating to public disclosure that generally involve a substantial expenditure of financial resources. \u00a0In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules subsequently contemplated and implemented by the SEC, requires changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. \u00a0We expect that full compliance with such rules and regulations will significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly, which may negatively impact our future financial results. \u00a0To the extent that our future earnings suffer as a result of the financial impact of our SEC reporting or compliance costs, our ability to develop an active trading market for our securities could be harmed., 172154=Operating Expenses. \u00a0Our total operating expenses for Fiscal 2011 were $136,577. \u00a0Our net loss was attributable to costs related to an early offering of our common stock and complying with our ongoing SEC reporting requirements, and have consisted primarily of legal, accounting and outside consulting fees., 307195=Statement of Operations, from February 23, 2011 (inception) through December 31, 2011, 729799=On November 27, 2012, we issued 227,800,000 and 8,200,000 shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value, to Seon Won and Jae Hwang, respectively, in consideration of their services to us as current and former officers and directors. \u00a0We valued these shares at $35,400,000, or $0.15 a share, which was the closing price of our common stock as quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board on the same day. \u00a0In connection with this issuance, we relied upon the exemption from the registration requirements pursuant to the provisions of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act as a transaction by an issuer not involving any public offering. \u00a0By virtue of Mr. Won\u0092s and Mr. Hwang\u0092s relationships with us, each had access to all relevant information relating to our business and represented that they each had the required investment intent. \u00a0In addition, the securities issued bore an appropriate restrictive legend., 171759=Net Loss. \u00a0We had net losses of ($138,206) for Fiscal 2011. \u00a0Our net loss was attributable to costs related to an early offering of our common stock and complying with our ongoing SEC reporting requirements, and have consisted primarily of legal, accounting and outside consulting fees., 153036=It is important to note that as of\u00a0 January 17, 2013 we had 500,000,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. \u00a0Our Articles of Incorporation authorizes us to issue a maximum of 500,000,000 shares of common stock. \u00a0In order to continue financing our operations through the issuance and sale of common stock we will need to amend our Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock. \u00a0Presently there are no plans to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock, but we cannot give any assurances that we will not increase \u0096 possibly significantly \u0096 the number of authorized shares of our common stock in the future should the opportunity to secure the additional financing necessary to continue and expand our operations arise., 713779=In January 2010, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure, to require reporting entities to separately disclose the amounts and business rationale for significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and separately present information regarding purchase, sale, issuance, and settlement of Level 3 fair value measures on a gross basis. \u00a0The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements., 695361=As of December 31, 2011, the Company had no shares of its preferred stock issued and outstanding., 254161=On November 27, 2012, we issued 227,800,000 and 8,200,000 shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value, to Seon Won and Jae Hwang, respectively, in consideration of their services to us as current and former officers and directors. \u00a0We valued these shares at $35,400,000, or $0.15 a share, which was the closing price of our common stock as quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board on the same day., 123123=Our common stock received clearance from FINRA to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board on September 11, 2012. \u00a0It did not start trading until November 2012., 164933=Operating Expenses. \u00a0Our total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2012 were $16,472 compared to $33,577 for the same period a year ago. \u00a0This represents a decrease in operating expenses of ($17,105), or (50.9%). \u00a0Our operating expenses were entirely related to complying with our ongoing SEC reporting requirements and applying for DTC Eligibility, which have consisted primarily of legal, accounting and outside consulting fees., 749500=Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (\u0093Act\u0094) may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the provisions above, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable., 693472=During the period February 23, 2011 (inception) to December, 2011 the Company issued an aggregate of 111,570,000 shares as follows:, 707503=As of December 31, 2011, the Company had a note payable to a related party stockholder in the amount of $35,650. \u00a0This note is payable on demand and is non-interest bearing. \u00a0As of December 31, 2011 this note has accrued $1,629 in imputed interest that has been recorded in the financial statements as additional paid-in capital., 712643=In January 2010, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC 505, Equity, where entities that declare dividends to shareholders that may be paid in cash or shares at the election of the shareholders are considered to be a share issuance that is reflected prospectively in EPS, and is not accounted for as a stock dividend. \u00a0This standard is effective for interim and annual periods ending on or after December 15, 2009 and is to be applied on a retrospective basis. \u00a0The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements., 156390=Management regularly evaluates the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare the financial statements. \u00a0A complete summary of these policies is included in Note 1 of SW China Import\u0092s audited financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2011 and unaudited financial statements for the nine-months ended September 30, 2012. \u00a0In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. \u00a0Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management., 561552=9/30/1212, 149530=We are a development stage corporation with limited operations and are not currently generating any revenues from our business operations. \u00a0Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a going concern opinion in their audit report dated March 22, 2012 which may be found in this prospectus under our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011. \u00a0This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next 12 months. \u00a0Accordingly, we must raise additional cash to sustain our operations., 122178=First Quarter (through January 17, 2013 ), 252443=We have not entered into any employment agreements with any of our officers or directors. \u00a0As of\u00a0 January 17, 2013 we had no employees other than those listed above. \u00a0All future employment arrangements are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors., 254695=We have no plans to begin paying our officers any cash compensation during the current fiscal year ending December 31, 2013 ., 741693=Incorporated by reference to registration statement (Registration No. 333-185571) on Form S-1 filed on December 20, 2012., 689909=The Company elected December 31st for its fiscal year end., 64104=We were incorporated on February 23, 2011, have generated no revenues and as of September 30, 2012 have incurred ($174,288) in losses. \u00a0We have very little operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made. \u00a0We have not achieved profitability and expect to continue to incur net losses over the next 12 months, probably even longer. \u00a0We expect to incur significant operating expenses and, as a result, will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, which may not occur. \u00a0Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on an ongoing basis which could cause us to go out of business., 442579=Balance, December 31, 2011 (audited), 239827=Mr. Hwang received 30,200,000 shares of our common stock on February 23, 2011. \u00a0These shares were issued as Founder\u0092s Shares, which are recorded with a net valuation of $-0-. \u00a0Mr. Hwang received an additional 8,200,000 shares of our common stock on November 27, 2012 which were valued at $1,230,000, which was the closing price of our common stock as quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board on the same day., 175784=As of September 30, 2012, we had no contractual obligations., 302487=Statement of Stockholders\u0092 (Deficit), for the period February 23, 2011 (inception) through September 30, 2012, 751386=Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the Registrant has duly caused this amendment to the registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Rockville, State of Maryland on the 18th day of January, 2013 ., 588516=March 23, 2012, 167921=Other income (expenses). \u00a0During the nine months ended September 30, 2012 we recorded ($3,012) in other expenses compared to ($731) compared to a year ago. \u00a0These other expenses included ($2,958) and ($731) in imputed interest expenses related to a note outstanding payable to a related party. \u00a0The imputed interest was recorded in our financial statements under additional paid-in capital., 167108=Operating Expenses. \u00a0Our total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 were $33,070, which is a $102,507, or 75.6%, decline compared to operating expenses of $135,577 for the period from February 23, 2011 (inception) through September 30, 2011. \u00a0Our operating expenses were entirely related to complying with our ongoing SEC reporting requirements and applying for DTC Eligibility, which have consisted primarily of legal, accounting and outside consulting fees. \u00a0The period from March 3, 2011 (inception) through September 30, 2011 included various one-time startup costs, including $100,000 paid to outside consultants in the form of common stock valued at $0.01 per share., 172899=As of September 30, 2012, we had $3,987 in cash and had no other assets. \u00a0Our total liabilities were $57,988 which consisted of $184 in accounts payable, $54 in accrued interest, $20,000 in a note payable to an unrelated party, and $37,750 in a note payable to a related party. \u00a0Further, we had no external credit facilities (i.e. bank loans, revolving lines of credit, etc.)., 165501=Other income (expenses). \u00a0During the three months ended September 30, 2012 we recorded ($1,234) in other expenses compared to ($731) compared to a year ago. \u00a0These other expenses included ($1,180) and ($731) in imputed interest expenses related to a note outstanding payable to a related party. \u00a0The imputed interest was recorded in our financial statements under additional paid-in capital., 209958=Our principal executive offices are located at 15800 Crabbs Branch Way, Ste. 310, Rockville, MD \u00a020855. \u00a0This office space is being provided to us by our former treasurer and secretary, Jae Hwang, free of charge. \u00a0Mr. Hwang remains a shareholder in SW China Imports and, as of January 17, 2013 , owned 39,000,000 shares,

tax loss carryforwards that can be utilized in future periods to reduce taxable income through 2030., 166368=Net Income (Loss). \u00a0We had a net loss of ($36,082) for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 compared to a net loss of ($136,308) for the period from February 23, 2011 (inception) through September 30, 2011. \u00a0The net loss for the period was the result of ongoing SEC compliance and reporting requirements and applying for DTC Eligibility, which consisted primarily of legal, accounting and outside consulting fees. \u00a0The period from February 23, 2011 (inception) through September 30, 2011 included various one-time costs, including $100,000 paid to outside consultants in the form of common stock valued at $0.01 per share., 687327=Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. \u00a0\u00a0Diluted earnings per shares is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. \u00a0During the period February 23, 2011 (inception) to December 31, 2011 the Company had no dilutive financial instruments issued or outstanding., 730824=On November 27, 2012, we issued an aggregate of 156,422,500 shares of common stock to the following outside consultants:, 710443=In October 2009, FASB issued an amendment to the accounting standards related to the accounting for revenue in arrangements with multiple deliverables including how the arrangement consideration is allocated among delivered and undelivered items of the arrangement. \u00a0Among the amendments, this standard eliminated the use of the residual method for allocating arrangement considerations and requires an entity to allocate the overall consideration to each deliverable based on an estimated selling price of each individual deliverable in the arrangement in the absence of having vendor-specific objective evidence or other third party evidence of fair value of the undelivered items. \u00a0This standard also provides further guidance on how to determine a separate unit of accounting in a multiple-deliverable revenue arrangement and expands the disclosure requirements about the judgments made in applying the estimated selling price method and how those judgments affect the timing or amount of revenue recognition. \u00a0The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements., 240516=The following table sets forth information with respect to compensation paid by us to our directors from inception on February 23, 2011 through December 31, 2012 . \u00a0Our fiscal year end is December 31., 171145=Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2011 (audited), 308753=Statement

in their audit report dated March 23, 2012, which is included in the audited financial statements that are a part of this prospectus. \u00a0This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next 12 months. \u00a0The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business. \u00a0As such, we may have to cease operations and you could lose your entire investment., 211341=This office space is being provided to us by our former treasurer and secretary, Jae Hwang, free of charge. \u00a0Mr. Hwang remains a shareholder in SW China Imports and, as of January 17, 2013 , owned 39,000,000 shares, or 7.8% of the issued and outstanding shares. \u00a0If Mr. Hwang decides to no
