            "PROCESS AND PLANT FOR THE THERMAL TREATMENT OF FINE-GRAINED SOLIDS - A process for at least one of a chemical and a physical treatment of fluidizable substances in a reactor. The process includes introducing a hot gas into an interior of the reactor through a gas supply tube and cooling at least one of the hot gas and the gas supply tube with a coolant. The cooling is performed by contacting the hot gas with the coolant so as to provide a temperature of a wall of the gas supply tube at least 50\u00b0 C. lower than a temperature of the gas at an inlet of the gas supply tube facing away from the interior of the reactor.",

The driver includes a detector configured to measure a switching characteristic of a switch in the external bridge to produce the drive signal with an adjustable waveform characteristic. The driver includes an adjustable circuit element to adjust the waveform characteristic in response to the measured switching characteristic. The measured switching characteristic may be a derivative of a voltage of the switch in the bridge such as a derivative of a drain-to-source voltage of a half-bridge circuit. The driver may be formed with an amplifier with an adjustable gain controlled by the signal produced by the detector. The adjustable gain amplifier may be formed with a transistor coupled in series with a leg of a current mirror. 04-01-2010 20100148733 Reverse Polarity Protection for MOSFETS - The invention relates to a control circuit and a corresponding method for controlling MOSFETs coupled to the control circuit.
