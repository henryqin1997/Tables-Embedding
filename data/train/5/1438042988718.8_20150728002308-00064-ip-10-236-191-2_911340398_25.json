            "There are Starbucks scattered about campus which is nice, but they are not run by starbucks employees, but campus employees. The cafe has a large selection - fresh, fried, prepackaged, almost anything you could want. But it's expensive.",
            "Be prepared to take more classes than you want; there are required religion, philosophy and interdisciplinary seminars. Even if you have courses completed with matching descriptions, they will not be accepted.",
            "The staff is incredibly supportive, helpful and encouraging. The class variety is broad and interesting. The nursing program is intense."

They have an EXCELLENT nursing program. The passing rate on the NCLEX in 2009 was 100% and that was the main reason why I decided to transfer to this school. I am also currently in the program and the courses really prepare you for thinking and analyzing as a nurse would. The professors are also very friendly and helpful. Bang for the buck This school is a bit pricey because it is a private university but to me it is worth it. Even though it is on the higher end a lot of the students are awarded with scholarships and if you are an in-state student many receive grants from the state. I was quite pleased with my financial aid award letter",
