            "Quinnipiac is an expensive school but they have a great endowment. As far as I am concerned this is one of the finest regional New England schools around and puts the University of New Haven to shame (a local rival university). It is right down the road from Yale and in comparison to their tuition, Quinnipiac is cheap but fair warning the cost of living on campus verse commuting is absolutely killer. Plus the school had a lot of housing space issues when I attended but that seems to be solved now with the new dorms they built. I think for the money you get a great education but I would spend the extra time looking around at other institutions before committing to Quinnipiac simply because I think there is better selection of schools that have more choices in undergraduate degrees than Quinnipiac. One of the down sides to this school is that its on-line program is limited to a few graduate schools so if you are like me and left school before you graduated, you have no recourse for completing the degree programs unless you physically attend the university. Dont forget that life does get in the way and sometimes you have to leave school so dont cut yourself short without any options to be able to finish your degree.",
            "Campus life has evolved since I attended the university. Round Top which sits atop a hill across the street from the main campus is the newest addition to the university. It has five new dorm buildings, student life center and a fabulous basketball and ice hockey arena. Additionally, there are tons of clubs to partake in. Mine was the College Republicans which was in its infancy while I attended.",
            "Absolutely fantastic. The dining hall was being completely renovated after I attended the university and it is even better than when I was enrolled at the school. The food is way more tastier than what you would expect to find in a cafeteria setting, like Luby's. Everything is fresh and very well done! Use your Q-Card to keep track of your meals too.",
            "I was a commuter student and did not live on campus however at that time, housing on campus was extremely limited. they have since built new dorms but I am unaware if this has solved the housing issue.",
            "Classes were challenging enough but not so bad that you dont have time for other activities. I found that the majority of your English classes will require a paper. A lot of my other courses were not paper intensive, instead relying on testing.",
            "Be prepared to participate in your classes! Class sizes are small and the professors will demand your participation. This is a fairly laid back campus but it was lacking in parking when I attended. Make good use of the Bernhard Library and dont hesitate to fall back on your professors for help. All of them will find the time to assist you in whatever you need.",
            "The most beautiful and enchanting campus I have ever seen. Class size is small and the instructors are exceptionally personable. A very technologically advanced institution with a wonderful library - did I mention that class instruction is beyond the pail?"

The first weekend in May, which marks the two week celebrations before finals and the end of school, is May Weekend, the biggest party weekend at QU., 154552=The school has over 100 different clubs and organizations. They hold many events such as concerts, dinners, carnivals, etc. Despite what many people think about typical school run events, they are actually a lot of fun to go to. Sporting events are also very popular to students. Basketball and Ice Hockey are the most popular sports since there is no football team. The Men's Ice Hockey team was ranked #1 in 2013 and went all the way to the Frozen Four. The biggest game of the year is the Quinnipiac-Yale game., 16589=May weekend, two weekends before finals everyone likes to party hard for a final time. The school actually use to sponsor it. Now the school does everything in their power to prevent it though, but they can't do much against off campus housing., 337108=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 269133=Our school went to the Frozen Four finals against Yale in 2012. Unfortunately we lost, but the whole student body was excited for this game. Therefore, Quinnipiac University is a great school for hockey fans., 81066=May Weekend- the last weekend in April all the students get drunk starting in the morning Friday till Sunday night., 244443=May weekend. The first weekend in May is nonstop day drinking.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here Being on campus is a blast and there is so much to do. Hike Sleeping Giant, hang out in the quad, go shopping in New Haven and Hamden, and of course the clubs on Thursdays and the weekends are a lot of fun. The rec center is pretty nice and intramural sports are a great way to get involved. There are a ton of clubs and organizations to get involved with. I transferred to QU in the spring semester and i had no problem making friends and getting involved. Everyone I've encountered has been extremely nice and genuine. The people here is what really makes this school so enjoyable. Am learning a lot All of my classes so far have challenged me. The professors are knowledgeable and more than willing to help you outside of class. I used to not like going to classes when i was in high school and before i transferred to QU, but now i look forward to it everyday.
