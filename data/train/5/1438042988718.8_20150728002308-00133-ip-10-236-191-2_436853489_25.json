            "METHOD FOR PRODUCING CELLULOSE DIACETATE - A method for producing cellulose diacetate with bamboo fibers as a raw material having the steps of soaking, treating with ultrasonic sound, de-acidifying, acetylating, hydrolyzing, precipitating, screening, extruding, washing, rolling, and drying. The method reduces the material loss and pollution, completely swells and dissolves the bamboo fibers, accelerates the fibrillation, reduces the crystallinity, improves the accessibility of the fibers, recycles acetic acid, and reduces the material consumption.",
            "WEAR-RESISTANT CLAMPING PLATE DEVICE FOR STUFFER BOX CRIMPER - A cheek plate device for a stuffer box crimper, comprising a bracket, adjusting mechanisms, cheek plates, a base, a pair of nip rollers and thrust devices. The adjusting mechanisms, which can slide relative to the bracket, are arranged on the bracket, the cheek plates are installed on the inner sides of the adjusting mechanisms, a pair of identical brackets, adjusting mechanisms and cheek plates are symmetrically installed on each side of the pair of nip rollers and affixed on the base. The adjusting mechanisms have adjusting blocks and elastic devices, the elastic devices are installed at the ends of the adjusting blocks and push against the thrust devices, the thrust devices push the adjusting blocks via the elastic devices, and the adjusting blocks push the two cheek plates moving towards the sides of the pair of nip rollers.",
            "WEAR-RESISTANT CLAMPING PLATE DEVICE FOR STUFFER BOX CRIMPER - A cheek plate device is provided for a stuffer box crimper, which has brackets, adjusting mechanisms, cheek plates, a base frame and a pair of nip rollers. The adjusting mechanisms are mounted on the brackets, which can slide relative to the bracket. The cheek plates are mounted on the inside of the adjusting mechanisms. Two identical brackets, adjusting mechanisms and cheek plates are mounted symmetrically at two sides of the pair of nip rollers and affixed on the base frame. The cheek plate device further comprises fluid thrust devices, which include fluid inlets and cylinders located on the brackets. One end of the adjusting mechanism is inserted into and coupled with the cylinder. The fluid of the thrust device flows into the cylinders through the inlets and pushes, via the adjusting mechanisms, the cheek plates toward the sides of the nip rollers. The thrust device can work hydraulically or pneumatically."

    "textAfterTable": "Jianwen Cao, Changshu CN Patent application number Description Published 20090127949 PERMANENT-MAGNET SYNCHRONOUS GEARLESS TRACTION MACHINE - A permanent-magnet synchronous gearless traction machine. The traction machine includes a permanent-magnet synchronous motor having a spindle; a traction wheel coupled to the spindle of the permanent-magnet synchronous motor; a first brake; and a second brake, wherein at least one of the first brake or the second brake is coupled to the traction wheel. As such, in the traction machine, since at least one of the first or second brakes is coupled to the traction wheel, the braking torque generated by the brake coupled to the traction wheel can brake the traction wheel directly, and thereby the operation safety of the elevator can be improved effectively. 05-21-2009 20090260927 DISK BRAKE - A disk brake for a traction machine having a damping height of a damping mechanism that can be adjusted integrally. According to one embodiment, a disk brake includes: a static iron core; a spring and a coil assembly in the static iron core; a dynamic iron core assembly including a dynamic iron core, a dynamic disk, and first and second friction rotors configured to fit with the dynamic iron core and the dynamic disk; a plurality of connecting bolts; a plurality of spacers; a damping mechanism on the dynamic iron core assembly, the damping mechanism including a plurality of damping components on the dynamic iron core; an adjusting toothed belt assembly",
