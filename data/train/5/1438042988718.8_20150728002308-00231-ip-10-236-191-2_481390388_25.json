These three methods for providing gamma adjustment with sub-pixel rendering can achieve the right color balance of images on a display. The methods of FIGS. 49 and 51 may also further improve the output brightness or luminance by improving the output contrast ratio. Specifically, FIG. 46 illustrates a method of applying a precondition-gamma prior to sub-pixel rendering; FIG. 49 illustrates a method for gamma-adjusted sub-pixel rendering; and FIG. 51 illustrates a method for gamma-adjusted sub-pixel rendering with an omega function. The advantages of these methods will be discussed below. The methods of FIGS. 46, 49, and 51 can be implemented in hardware, firmware, or software, as described in detail regarding FIG. 52A through FIG. 72. The reader is referred to U.S. patent application Publication 2003/0085906, the publication of the parent application, for an example of exemplary software code which may be used to implement the sub-pixel rendering methods disclosed herein.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{227469=For scaling ratios above approximately 2:3 and higher, the sub-pixel rendered resampled data set for the PenTile\u2122 matrix arrangements of sub-pixels is more efficient at representing the resulting image. If an image to be stored and/or transmitted is expected to be displayed onto a PenTile\u2122 display and the scaling ratio is 2:3 or higher, it is advantageous to perform the resampling before storage and/or transmission to save on memory storage space and/or bandwidth. Such an image that has been resampled is called \u201cprerendered\u201d. This prerendering thus serves as an effectively loss-less compression algorithm. One advantage of this technique is being able to take most any stored image and prerender it onto any practicable color sub-pixel arrangement., 181205=When scaling down there are more input pixels than output sub-pixels. At any scale factor greater than 1:1 (e.g., 101:100 or 2:1) the filter size becomes 4\ufffd4 or larger. It will be difficult to convince hardware manufacturers to add more line buffers to implement this. However, staying within the range of 1:1 and 1:2 has the advantage that the kernel size stays at a constant 3\ufffd3 filter. Fortunately, most of the cases that will have to be implemented in hardware fall within this range and it is reasonable to write the program to simply generate 3\ufffd3 kernels. In some special cases, like the example done above by hand, some of the filter kernels will be smaller than 3\ufffd3. In other special cases, even though it is theoretically possible for the filter to become 3\ufffd3, it turns out that every filter is only 2\ufffd2. However, it is easier to calculate the kernels for the general case and easier to implement hardware with a fixed kernel size., 239915=The following methods, for purposes of explanation, are described using the highest resolution of pixel to sub-pixel ratio (P:S) of 1:1. That is, for the one pixel to one sub-pixel resolution, a filter kernel having 3\ufffd3 coefficient terms is used. Nevertheless, other P:S ratios can be implemented, for example, by using the appropriate number of 3\ufffd3 filter kernels. For example, in the case of P:S ratio of 4:5, the 25 filter kernels above can be used., 920049=The general formulation of the gamma-adjusted-with-omega rendering with the cross color sharpening for super-native scaling (i.e., scaling ratios of 1:2 or higher) can be represented as follows for the red and green sub-pixels:, 177425=These ratios will be referred to as the pixel to sub-pixel or P:S ratio, where P is the input pixel numerator and S is the sub-pixel denominator of the ratio. The number of filter kernels needed across or down a repeat cell is S in these ratios. The total number of kernels needed is the product of the horizontal and vertical S values. In almost all the common VGA derived screen sizes the horizontal and vertical repeat pattern sizes will turn out to be identical and the number of filters required will be S2. From the table above, a 640\ufffd480 image being scaled to a 1024\ufffd768 PenTile matrix has a P:S ratio of 5:8 and would require 8\ufffd8 or 64 different filter kernels (before taking symmetries into account)., 64344=This application is a divisional of and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser.

Filter numbers are all divided by 256. The minimum number of filters needed, with symmetries, is 6, and the number of filters generated here, with no symmetry, is 25., 178178=In a theoretical environment, fractional values that add up to one are used in a filter kernel. In practice, as mentioned above, filter kernels are often calculated as integer values with a divisor that is applied afterwards to normalize the total back to one. It is important to start by calculating the weight values as accurately as possible, so the rendering areas can be calculated in a co-ordinate system large enough to assure all the calculations are integers. Experience has shown that the correct co-ordinate system to use in image scaling situations is one where the size of an input pixel is equal to the number of output sub pixels across a repeat cell, which makes the size of an output pixel equal the number of input pixels across a repeat cell. This is counter-intuitive and seems backwards. For example, in the case of scaling 512 input pixels to 640 with a 4:5 P:S ratio, you can plot the input pixels on graph paper as 5\ufffd5 squares and the output pixels on top of them as 4\ufffd4 squares. This is the smallest scale at which both pixels can be drawn, while keeping all the numbers integers. In this co-ordinate system, the area of the diamond shaped rendering areas centered over the output sub-pixels is always equal to twice the area of an output pixel or 2*P2. This is the minimum integer value that can be used as the denominator of filter weight values., 567279=The reason for the coefficient of 2 for the ordinal average terms compared to the diagonal terms is the ratio of 0.125:0.0625=2 in the filter kernel. This can keep each contribution to the local average equal., 1165845=Exemplary C code that may be used for implementing the methods disclosed herein is provided in an Appendix to the parent application, U.S. Ser. No. 10/150,355, which is published as U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0103058 and incorporated herein by reference. The C code, which is subject to copyright protection in which the copyright owner reserves all copyrights contained herein, may be translated for any other appropriate executable programming language to implement the techniques disclosed herein., 213035=Filter kernels for these hexagonal sampling areas 123 can be generated in the same geometrical way as was described above, with diamonds for red and green or squares for blue. The rendering areas are simple hexagons and the area of overlap of these hexagons with the surrounding input pixels is measured. Unfortunately, when using the slightly wider hexagonal sampling areas 123, the size of the filter kernels sometimes exceeds a 3\ufffd3 filter, even when staying between the scaling ratios of 1:1 and 1:2. Analysis shows that if the scaling ratio is between 1:1 and 4:5 the kernel size will be 4\ufffd3. Between scaling ratios of 4:5 and 1:2, the filter kernel size will remain 3\ufffd3. (Note that because the hexagonal sampling areas 123 are the same height as the square sampling areas 276 the vertical size of the filter kernels remains the same).}",
