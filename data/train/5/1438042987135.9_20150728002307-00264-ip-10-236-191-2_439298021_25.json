            "Transcriptional repression of sodium-iodide symporter in thyroid carcinoma - The present disclosure relates to a sodium iodide symporter (NIS)-repressor binding site (NRBS) consisting of a DNA molecule spanning from \u2212645 to \u2212605 nucleotides (SEQ ID NO:4) or from \u2212648 to \u2212620 nucleotides (SEQ ID NO:5) upstream from the translation start site of human NIS gene. The disclosure further relates to a method of restoring iodide transport to a human thyroid carcinoma cell, including: the steps of: i) contacting the cell expressing and forming a NIS repressor protein complex capable of binding to the NRBS of the disclosure with a modulator of said complex, and ii) administering to the cell radiolabeled iodide.",

A scanned 3D volume is segmented guided by a confidence measure to create a label volume whose voxels specify the detected object IDs. The luggage dataset and the label volume are visualized by volume rendering. Using an automatic coloring algorithm, any pair of objects whose projections are adjacent in an image are assigned distinct hues. A layered framework efficiently renders a scene mixed with packed luggage, animated unpacking objects, and already unpacked objects put aside for further inspection. A GPU is used to automatically select objects that are not blocked by others and can be unpacked.</td> <td>20150022522</td> <tr> </tr> <td>03-14-2013</td> <td><a href=\"/patents/app/20130063436\">FLOATING VOLUME-OF-INTEREST IN MULTILAYER VOLUME RAY CASTING</a> - A method that includes receiving vertices of a mesh, wherein the mesh represents a volume of interest (VOI)",
