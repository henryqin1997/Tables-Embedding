There are only about 1100 students, making this a tight-knit community. We have an excellent faculty that go above and beyond to not only educate their students, but to help guide them in their spiritual life and get to know the students personally and individually., 124234=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 17346=This school is for you if you are willing to work hard. Many of the classes will be very difficult if you come with the attitude that you can just slide by with C's. The tuition is costly, so unless you have a small fortune, you can't afford to barely slide by. While the academics are challenging, the atmosphere of the school is amazing. Students gather all over campus to pray for and encourage each other. Chapel attendance is mandatory. Apply early! If you can, do the Early Deposit Program that is due in March. It is only $100 and it gives you priority in financial aid awarding!}",

Students desiring to grow in their walk with God - you'll be challenged to grow daily. Students who like community. Tips for prospective students Apply early. There's a scholarship for applying early! Come visit campus. Meeting tons of people from Simpson is what confirmed for me that Simpson is where I wanted to go to school. Bang for the buck Simpson isn't the cheapest school, but it's well worth the price you pay. They offer lots of financial aid too. Am enjoying being here I love the small community here at Simpson. The student body is like a giant family, everyone is encouraging and friendly. The campus is small but beautiful. Am learning a",
