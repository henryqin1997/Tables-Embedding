    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Folsom Lake College is a great campus for those students that have a burning desire to transfer from an acknowledged campus to a 4-year institution. It is a great campus to get all of the general education requirements out of the way at a fraction of the cost that a tradition 4-year institution would cost. Tips for prospective students One thing that I would urge prospective students to do is to watch deadlines like a hawk and do everything as early as possible. With the state budget being late and education being a lower priority than it should be, competition for a seat in any class is tough. So if you have even the slightest notion that you are going to attend this campus, get done with your assessment test early and speak with a counselor as soon as possible. Bang for the buck When it comes to getting your bang for the buck, nothing could apply more to this than community college. At Folsom Lake College, it is $26 per unit so for a full time student, someone who is enrolled in at least 12 units, it comes to $624 for both the fall and spring semester. At a CSU or an UC, it costs more than triple",
