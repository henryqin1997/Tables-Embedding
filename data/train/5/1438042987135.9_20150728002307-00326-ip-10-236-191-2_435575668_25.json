The shutting frequency of the shutter mechanism is predetermined or preset by an electronic controller. The 3-D viewing glass has a shutting mechanism which is arranged to shut the left- and right-viewers at a predetermined, preset or pre-programmed means there is no need to extract electronic synchronization signals from the video source and this makes the 3-D viewing glass more economical and more convenient to use. 11-03-2011 20140098202 THREE-DIMENSIONAL VIEWING SYSTEM - A three-dimensional viewing system includes a television having an electric circuit provided therein for the generation of alternating left-eye image and right-eye image on a screen, a micro controller unit provided inside the television and configured to extract a vertical synchronizing signal therefrom, a signal transmitting system for directly transmitting the vertical synchronizing signal to a pair of three-dimensional shutter glasses to be worn by the viewer in front of the television. The shutter glasses include left and right liquid crystal shutter lenses",
