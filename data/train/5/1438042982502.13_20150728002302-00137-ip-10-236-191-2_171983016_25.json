Where appropriate, Mineral Resources are also spatially constrained within notional mining volumes based on metal prices of US$1,400/oz for gold and US$4.00/lb for copper. This is a conservative approach adopted to eliminate non-contiguous mineralisation from resource estimates., 16119=The JORC Code 2012, which came into effect on 1 December 2013, prescribes completion of a pre-feasibility study as a minimum prerequisite to declare an Ore Reserve (the JORC equivalent of a Mineral Reserve); however this requirement of the JORC Code does not come into effect until 1 December 2014., 172341=Published February 13, 2014 \u0096 Reads 515 Copyright \u00a9 2014 SYS-CON Media, Inc. \u2014 All Rights Reserved.

Investors should note that it is a requirement of the ASX listing rules that the reporting of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources in Australia comply with the 2012 Edition of the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (the \"JORC Code\") and that Newcrest's Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates comply with the JORC Code. Newcrest ceased its listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") on 4 September 2013, but will remain subject to certain Canadian disclosure requirements and standards until it ceases to be an Ontario Securities Commission registrant. Prior to that, Newcrest will continue, in accordance with the requirements of National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects of the Canadian Securities Administrators, to report its Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources estimates in compliance with the JORC Code, along with a reconciliation to the material differences between the JORC Code and the applicable definitions adopted by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM Definition Standards). In relation to the December 2013 Resources and Reserves Statement, the reconciliation is set out in Newcrest's Canadian News Release dated 14 February 2014, and is available at www.sedar.com and at Newcrest's website www.newcrest.com.au.\u00a0 Except as otherwise noted in that document, there are no material differences between the definitions of Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources, and Proven and Probable Reserves, under the CIM Definition Standards and the equivalent or corresponding definitions in the JORC Code., 330565=Terms of Use & Our Privacy Statement - About Newsfeeds / Videofeeds.
