    "textBeforeTable": "Link Post \u00a0 Topic \u00a0 (x) Offline Well you need e-remote. The debuffing char needs to be fastest of whole team. The Debuffer, depending on element uses his/her debuff skill i.e.: slowdown for fire. Then the rest of team attacks. Rinse and repeat for next mob. The more spawns the more xp gained. In hunting grounds get around 1700xp tops for my fire. Also, once sp reaches a certain limit use soul dodge to replenish it. @aaron: Yes, I used capsules from 15r. I'm a full time university student so I can't be online much to train anymore. :P What's the debuff training method?

I bursted until level 180, then I attended the 15 Rounds Challenge every week. It gives you 25% a week, so you can level roughly once every 4 weeks. Simple as that. (: Offline",
