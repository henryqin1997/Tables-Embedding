Everything revolves and around meal plan, which happens three times a day: 730-930, 11-130, and 430 - 730 during the weekday, and 1030-130 and 430-630 on the weekends. You have the big caf\u00c3\u00a9 and small caf\u00c3\u00a9 (close from Friday evening -sun), the small caf\u00c3\u00a9, the student center (chic-fil-a, tropical smoothie, and pizza hut), Spartan Station (burgers, burritos, and subs) and the Bodega which doesn't have meal plan, but is perfect for late night dining when you have dining dollars have Spartan bucks. After awhile it gets old and you'll be begging your parents for money to eat off campus.}",
