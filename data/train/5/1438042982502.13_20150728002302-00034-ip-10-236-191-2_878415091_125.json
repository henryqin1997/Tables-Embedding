            "The campus safety is only rate three stars because of the fact that ERAU DB campus is open to the community. There have been a few incidents on campus, but nothing that couldn't be handled by the Campus Safety Dept. Overall, I feel safe on campus, even at night.",
            "The Greek life on campus in unusual and not as major as a public school. There is only one frat house and it is located on the far edge of campus. There are at least ten different organizations on campus, including a service oriented fraternity.",
            "The amount of extracurricular on campus is impressive. I am the member of 2-3 clubs on campus. It is a great way to meet new friends and go on road trips.",
            "Math and science oriented students will love ERAU. Also, students who love flying airplanes or aircraft mechanic work. There are many majors to choose from that are all aviation related in some regard.",
            "The spirit rock is an unusual tradition on campus. Different clubs and organizations on campus spray messages on the rock. It is usually used to advertise an event on campus or school spirit.",
            "At ERAU, the return on investment of engineering and science students is very lucrative. Additionally pilots have good recognition as graduates from ERAU. The only reason why the bang for the buck is four stars is because many students accumulate an enormous amount of debt, especially pilots.",
            "There's no so much to do in Daytona. The best things to do are go the the beach, go to the Port Orange Pavilion for the movies, Daytona Ice Arena, Sweet Frog Frozen Yogurt and go on camping trips in nearby wooded areas.",
            "The selection of food is not so healthy. The best food places are Chick-Fil-A, Einstein's and the salad bar. It's also a bummer that most of school food venues are closed over holidays, including spring break.",
            "The dorms are not very good for the price. There are no kitchens in the freshman dorms and many of the upperclassmen dorms. Also, it is a very cramped space and there is a large problem with humidity.",
            "The courses at ERAU are very rigorous and are of top quality. Each course tests your limits. Be prepared to learn a lot and to practice a lot of self-learning techniques.",
            "Be prepared to learn for yourself, because your professors are not going to teach you. Always arrive early to class and finish assignments well before the due date. Only take 12 credit hours your first semester, even if you were an AP student in high school: This school is very academically rigorous, and the shock of this could lead to you losing control of your academics.",
            "ERAU is a great school with great educational programs, so it is worth the high price tag. You will meet very good people compared to the average population. If you are an engineer, pilots will be your worst enemy and vice versa."

However, the campus is in an ideal location (4 miles from the beach), and the weather is almost always sunny. Another plus is that the faculty and staff typically do everything they can to help you; the university does everything it can to make your college experience amazing., 609387=I just got accepted and i am super excited to attend. To me i thought it was pretty easy to get into to but also i do have high test scores. I cant wait to attend in Fall of 2015, 509876=Don't burn a hole in your pocket to go here. If you're on an ROTC scholarship, great. If you have the money, great. This school will not give you that big of an advantage, but it really is great for aerospace engineering. If you aren't passionate about aviation, don't go here. I came here to get connected to the space program, but I had no advantage. I'm going somewhere else where I can focus more on meteorology. Also, they are knocking down so many buildings. The campus is kind of a mess, and it will be for the next few years. They are rebuilding a new Arts & Sciences building, so some of your classes will be in trailers. They said it was going to be up for the Spring 2014 semester, but I hear from students that it isn't done. They are also going to knock down and rebuild the library, the student center, and the McKay dorms. You can definitely see where your tuition dollars are going. It was rather frustrating!, 623438=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot This is a challenging school, and you can start taking classes relevant to your major, whatever it may be, in your second semester or year, depending on what classes you earn credit for in high school or community college. There are no real general education classes like in other schools, so a degree from Embry-Riddle is more specialized than a degree from other schools.

Even if you're considering a degree in business, homeland security, or a different discipline of engineering, having a university such as this on your resume will no doubt get you any job you could possible want.
