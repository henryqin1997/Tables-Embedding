Administering Secure RPC (Task Map) With every transaction after the first transaction, the client returns the index ID to the server in its next transaction. The client also sends another encrypted timestamp. The server sends back the client's timestamp minus 1, which is encrypted by the conversation key. Handling Transactions in Secure RPC The client receives the verifier and authenticates the server. The client knows that only the server could have sent the verifier because only the server knows what timestamp the client sent. Authenticating the Server in Secure RPC The reason for subtracting 1 from the client's timestamp is to ensure that the timestamp is out of date. An out-of-date timestamp cannot be reused as a client verifier. The client's timestamp minus 1, which is encrypted by the conversation key The index ID, which the server records in its credential cache The server returns a verifier to the client, which includes the following: Returning the Verifier to the Client in Secure RPC Implicit in these transactions is the name of the caller, who must be authenticated in some manner. The keyserver cannot use DES authentication to authenticate the caller because the use of DES by the keyserver would",
