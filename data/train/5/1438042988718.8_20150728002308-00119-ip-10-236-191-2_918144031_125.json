            "I go workout, play basketball at the Rec Center they have almost everyday. Also they have a hangout place called The Roost. It has a lot of things to do. I personally go up there and shoot some pool.",
            "It is fair. In my opinion there can be more options. But there are a lot of healthy choices.",
            "The room isn't too impressive at Chisholm Hall, but its the experience that you get out of it that is priceless. It is easy for you to get to know people around your area and also see who has your same field of study. You'll learn easily that just being yourself and getting involved in activities actually helps you get connections and at the same time new friends.",
            "It depends on how you manage your time and also of how dedicated you are on getting your work done. To me the difficulty and challenges here at UTSA are easy to avoid and overcome. Just learn how to use your time right and always make room to study.",
            "Get involved with the programs that UTSA provide. The programs are excellent for upcoming freshmen to get involved and familiar with the campus. Also helps you with the decision on what university you want to attend to.",
            "University of Texas at San Antonio is very student friendly. The staff are easy to communicate with and are willing to help you with any need. Also it is a great learning environment for any one to excel in any study field."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{803943=There is a wide variety of clubs and activities to choose from and the Rec Center is always full of classes that range from martial arts to dancing. The activity that I absolutely fell in love with while at UTSA was quidditch. I was interested in it and attended practices and games but was not on the team because I knew I was transferring at the end of the year. The team has a great camaraderie and made it all the way to World Cup VI this year. This is a huge accomplishment because the team was created in the Fall semester of 2012. This group of people is filled with a combination of hard workers and laid back fun guys whose personalities blend wonderfully with each other. They take care of each other and have each other\u00e2??s back. UTSA quidditch has become part of the world wide community of quidditch and I am fortunate enough to be able to say that I was there when it began. It is fun, a great way to meet people and a surprising form of exercise. Do not expect to gain the freshman fifteen if you are working out with this team. I HIGHLY recommend joining this team to any and all students at UTSA., 845303=I hear that the parking lot at the 1604 Campus is usually packed. Like, people fight for parking lots. You don't have to worry about that if you are living on campus. But, if you live in San Antonio, and plan to reside somewhere else besides campus, remember that the parking is a disaster and the parking permit for a year is like eight hundred dollars. Just saying., 844700=Sign your contract soon like in January if you don't want to be living with random people., 314125=UTSA is one of the least expensive universities in San Antonio. As tuition rises, scholarships and grants offered by UTSA can be found through the financial aid office and are easier to find upon completing the FAFSA before April each year. Tuition costs rise as enrollment increases and academic requirements increase as Tier One Status approaches!, 380655=There are Hookah Bars everywhere. La Cantera shopping mall is right across 1604, also the theater is really close as well., 800321=Apply early, the earlier you apply the earlier you can get accepted and get the classes you want. Register for classes around a schedule you can handle. If you don't like being awake at 7 in the morning, don't register for a 7 o'clock class. That affects your learning., 40967=I am only here for a short while, both at the downtown campus and 1604 but I really like it. The downtown campus is located very conveniently in the heart of downtown, so if your not from San Antonio, a little sight seeing between classes could be something fun to do., 785181=The University of Texas at San Antonio looks like a great school (will be attending in the 2013-2014 year). The student life looks very lively. A great environment to learn in., 146330=a lot of the more exciting options in san antonio are downtown, which requires a fifteen/twenty minute drive from the 1604 campus. (the 1604 campus is the main campus, but there is another utsa campus downtown. i believe that many of the poli-sci and architecture classes take place downtown.) the riverwalk, of course, is a major tourist attraction. it can be a bit expensive, but it's a lovely place to visit, especially if you've never seen it before. during the winter holiday season, the riverwalk is lined with lots of beautiful lights, and it is dyed green for st. patrick's day. it's a pretty festive area with lots of great bars, restaurants, and shopping opportunities. first friday (an event which, appropriately enough, occurs on the first friday of the month) is an opportunity to go downtown to look at various art and music events and, of course, bar-hop. san antonio has a city orchestra which plays on a somewhat regular basis throughout the year, and various theaters offer chances to watch plays and musicals. there are three alamo drafthouses in san antonio, movie theaters which play a mix of the old and the new and allow you to buy meals and alcohol from waitresses while actually watching the movies. the drafthouses regularly have theme nights, so if you're an anime-nut, a rocky horror picture show fan, or ... well ... any number of other things, you'll like these movie theaters. the arts scene in san antonio is booming, and there are lots of great galleries downtown. the mcnay museum of modern art is also a wonderful place to visit, and it has free admission on thursday afternoons/nights and on the first sunday of the month. the san antonio museum of art is also worth a glance, though not quite as impressive as the mcnay, and it also has times that offer free admission. closer to the 1604 campus are lots of great cafes and a few good bars, including the best jazz bar in san antonio, chango's havana club, and flying saucer, which has the best beer selection in town (hundreds of different kinds). for thrill seekers, the six flags fiesta texas amusement park is really right down the street, as is sea world. san antonio's most famous shopping center, la cantera, is also very close to the 1604 campus. for those who like a little country in their lives, the hill country is a short drive away, featuring lots of lovely towns with various food and agricultural festivals, knitting and quilting events, and general small-town charm. to sum it all up, san antonio might seem a bit more quieter than other major cities at first glance, but there is really quite a lot to do in the city. whether you're interested in sports, the arts, community service, or nights out on the town, there are lots of wonderful options. if you can't find something to do on friday night (or even on wednesday night), you probably just haven't looked hard enough., 983565=Currently transferring to UTSA, starting on Jan 13. UTSA put together a fantastic 3 day transition workshop for new students. I was very impressed and learned a lot about college life at UTSA., 1088262=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 876515=To all incoming freshman, there is a new tradition starting this year, Fall 2013. Before every home football game, and yes we are a division 1 school, freshmen get to rush out onto the field with their own individual jerseys! THIS IS ONLY FOR FRESHMEN, so I suggest you get involved., 1062503=The courses are challenging but as long as you put in the work they become easy. the professors are very understanding and all my classes are easy because i put in work.The only class that is very challenging is Biosciences 1404., 424608=This is not applicable to me as I have not lived int he dorms, but I do know that the majority of dorms are very new and the one old dorm was completely remodeled in 2005.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Everyone who is new coming freshman. Tips for prospective students You may think college is all fun and parties, it is but then if you do not know where your priorities lie, you can get bad grades thus might getting on probation. A good tip is to remain focused, do your work, never fall behind and study! Parties will always be here and there and fun is all around, just manage it all carefully. Bang for the buck Yes, money is always an issue no matter what college you attend. Still, the faculty of financial aid are willing to help you get the most of your aid and help you out with payments. Plus, make sure you save up some money, or a lot of money for books and housing, that includes food. Am enjoying being here I love the environment, the people, the whole feeling of being here and doing what i want to do. Am learning a lot What is there to learn about U.T.S.A. ?
