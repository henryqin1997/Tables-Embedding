You need the container if you move or ship the SCE 2000 platform in the future., 189479=The dual power supply units supply hot-swappable, redundant power. Redundant power is useful as a failover; if a situation occurs where one power supply is down (for instance, a power supply fails or a new power supply needs to be installed), the SCE 2000 can continue to run properly using the other power supply., 137783=The bypass of the traffic through the failed SCE 2000 is configurable, and the user may choose to always cutoff the line that goes through the failed SCE 2000. In this case network redundancy protocols like HSRP are responsible for identifying the line cutoff and switching all the traffic to go through the functioning SCE 2000., 181827=When the appropriate mounting brackets are securely installed, the SCE 2000 can be installed into the rack., 175156=Before installing the SCE 2000 in the rack, you must first install an appropriate rack-mount bracket on each side of the front of the SCE 2000, as illustrated in the following figure. See Tools and Parts Required for a listing of the parts and tools required for installing the rack\u2013mount., 522088=Figure\u00a0A.4.\u00a0Bypass Connectors on the Rear of the SCE 2000, 152107=Table\u00a04.1.\u00a0SCE 2000 Dimensions, 317210=Priority (cascade topology only) \u2014 In a cascade topology, this parameter determines which SCE 2000 is chosen as the active SCE 2000 in the \u201cactive election\u201d procedure. This decision is taken only when both SCE 2000s are starting up together. If there is one working SCE 2000 and the other is just starting up, then the working one will automatically be chosen as active and the other one as standby. This parameter can be set to one of the following:, 500355=Peer does not receive traffic from SCE 2000 (GBE link is lit and Tx LED is flashing), 360149=Port 3: Cascade, connect to Port 4 in SCE 2000 #2, 108197=SCE 2000 and all accessories unpacked, 362578=By default, the SCE 2000 GBE line interface ports are configured with auto-negotiation disabled.

In this case the link connected to port1-port2 is by default link-0 and the link connected to port3-port4 is be default link-1., 344429=This completes the procedures for connecting the management interfaces and for initial configuration of the SCE 2000 platform. Proceed to the next chapter for a description of the procedures for cabling the Gigabit Ethernet ports and for configuring Gigabit Ethernet (GBE) interface parameters., 282507=The SCE 2000 can be configured with Access Control Lists (ACLs), which are used to permit or deny incoming connections on any of the management interfaces., 520963=Connect the control cable to the Bypass 1 9-pin D-Type connector on the rear panel of the SCE 2000 platform., 89294=Table\u00a02.3.\u00a0SCE 2000 LED Groups, 525068=It is recommended that the two GBE interfaces of the SCE 2000 platform, as well as the GBE interfaces of the switch/router on either side of the External Optical Bypass module, be configured toAuto-Negotiation = OFF, 505821=Auto-negotiation is disabled at the SCE 2000 but enabled at peer., 381274=Connect the traffic port of SCE 2000 platform #1. This will cause a momentary down time until the network elements from both sides of the SCE 2000 platform auto-negotiate with it and start working (when working inline). (See Dual Link: Two SCE 2000s Topology.), 87117=10/100/1000 Ethernet RJ-45 ports for management of the SCE 2000., 133092=In this topology, one SCE 2000 is connected in receive-only mode to two full duplex, GBE links using optical splitters. If the two links are load-shared, asymmetrical routing might occur, and some of the flows may be split, i.e. the upstream packets of the flow go on one link, and the downstream packets go on the other link., 392096=SCE 2000 4xGBE \u2014 GBE1-GBE2/GBE3-GBE4, 380080=Set topology configurations for each SCE 2000 platform via the connection-mode options.

However, if you encounter problems starting it, use the information in this chapter to help isolate the cause of the problems. The procedures in this chapter assume that you are troubleshooting the initial system startup, and that your SCE 2000 platform is in the original factory configuration. If you have removed or replaced components or changed any default settings, the recommendations in this chapter might not apply. Make sure to review the safety warnings listed in the Regulatory Compliance and Safety Information for the Cisco Service Control Enginedocument that accompanied your SCE 2000 platform before using the troubleshooting procedures in this chapter., 143529=Single SCE 2000 inline installation = \u201cInline\u201d connection mode., 142669=Receive-only \u2014 The SCE 2000 does not reside physically on the data link. Data is forwarded to the SCE 2000 via an external switch.

In this scenario, when the SCE 2000 detects a failure that requires a reboot process for recovering, it immediately switches to Bypass mode, allowing all traffic to bypass the SCE 2000. The SCE 2000 stays in Bypass mode maintaining the network link, albeit without SCE 2000 processing, until the SCE 2000 fully recovers from the failure and is ready to resume normal functioning., 107146=Table\u00a02.5.\u00a0SCE 2000 Installation Checklist, 406713=On the SCE 2000 Front panel, examine that the Status LED is flashing green., 85419=The SCE 2000 Front Panel consists of ports and LEDs as shown in the following figure and tables.}",
