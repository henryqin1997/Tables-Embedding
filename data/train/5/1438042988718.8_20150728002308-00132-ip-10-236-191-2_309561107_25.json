The league was re-established in 1937 with Vancouver as the sole holdover from the 1922 league. After shutting down for 3 years during World War II, the league was again rebuilt in 1946. The league had operated as a Class B from 1922 through 1951 and the National Association promoted it to Class A in 1952. Spokane, WA and Vancouver, BC were represented in all 15 years of the second incarnation (1937-1954). The league changed its name to the Northwest League in 1955. Long-standing members of the various Western International Leagues were Yakima, Vancouver, Tacoma and Spokane; all but Tacoma are still a presence in the Northwest League.}",
