Postage UK and particularly international postage charges have risen sharply (May 2012).\u00a0 The amount we charge is what we expect to pay plus approx 20-30p for packing materials.\u00a0 Multiple items postage If you are ordering multiple items, there will be automatic approximated reduction in postage costs \u2013 but make sure you order them together, not individually.\u00a0 If the estimate still looks excessive, don't pay but click on the 'Request total from seller' button in the shopping basket.\u00a0 We'll then recalculate the costs for your combined items postage and send you an invoice.\u00a0 The postage may or may not calculate as less; we\u2019re trying to refine the accuracy of the automation. Delivery time excludes weekends and Bank Holidays, which may be different in the UK from elsewhere.\u00a0 Packets to overseas destinations (particularly Italy and Russia) often take longer than advertised due to local customs delays.\u00a0 Note: the date printed on our postage is two days after we print it, ie it\u2019s the date it remains valid for posting until with Royal Mail, not the date of posting. Problem? We want you to be really happy with your purchase.\u00a0 If you\u2019re not, or something\u2019s gone wrong, please message us.\u00a0 We will do our very best to resolve any problem.\u00a0 If our item description isn\u2019t quite right, or you think we\u2019ve overcharged on postage, please let us know instead of marking down our ebay feedback.\u00a0 If you have an order problem you\u2019d like to resolve quickly, you can try phoning us on +44(0)208 537 3445.\u00a0 Good manners are appreciated! Ebay Messaging The ebay messaging system doesn\u2019t include your name, date of purchase or payment, or even the order reference number.\u00a0 It\u2019ll help us deal with your query faster if you can include any of those.\u00a0 Please remember, the ebay shop is not our main business so we may not always respond immediately; but we will get back to you. If you order multiple items, you only pay 50% postage on the subsequent items.}",
