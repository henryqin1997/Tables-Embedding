            "I would say the safety could be a lot better, but there are security guards that drive around campus all the time. When we are dancing out side and something crazy happens we can call security and they will be there in a very quick manner. Overall the campus is safe with a few mishaps here and there.",
            "The Greeks are very friendly (at least to me they are). When they have pageants or they showcase something it's always fun to watch. Yes there are rivals, but they all come together as one when the time is right.",
            "There is PLENTY to do at UAPB, you just have to get off your butt and go find something that interests you.",
            "This school is great for people who would be involved on campus. I believe that if you love supporting your school and going to basketball games or foot ball games you would really enjoy it, because the band is phenomenal, the cheerleaders have such high spirit, the Greek life always comes and show strolls, it is very entertaining to watch.",
            "The bell tower, which is located at the center of campus has a myth that says if you walk through it, you will not graduate. So majority of people do not walk through it. if they walk and stand underneath it,they walk out the same way they came in.",
            "There isn't a lot to do in Pine Bluff so it kind of sucks that I pay all this money and when I'm not in class or practice I have nothing else to do, but the school is great I enjoy it,I believe that everyone should visit an HBCU because it's a lot of fun.",
            "There is not a lot to do in Pine Bluff. If you want to do something fun you would go to Little Rock. It is a mall in Pine Bluff, but there is not that many options in it and the movie theater sucks. There is plenty of on campus activities for instance I am in the band, I dance, so I'm busy all the time. If your not involved on campus, you would be very bored.",
            "The food in the cafe had it's great days and it's bad days. I would say always go and see what they have before you swipe your card. The Trio is very nice. It was a lot healthier, and they made great pizzas. We also had a checkers or Rally's on campus and it was great, but if you eat it to much you will start gaining a few pounds.",
            "The dorms it self were fine, with few bug problems here and there. For me personally, I didn't like being on the same hallway and sharing a bathroom with other people. Some girls were not as home-trained as I and my room mate was.",
            "For me, I rate it a 4 because I am a fairly smart student, so I do not pursue easy classes. The classes that I was in were challenging and made me think.",
            "Yes, it is a HBCU so the non-graduating rate will be high because African American do not typically put the effort into it. UAPB will be great if you put the effort into it. I would own a refrigerator because the food sometimes isn't not all that great.",
            "It is a great school if you put the effort into it. The campus could be better, but the buildings are nice."

A student fired a gun twice on campus, and no one was evacuated, emailed, called, etc. I had no idea this even happened until I saw it online later that night. Obviously this has been a reoccurring problem because the university and chancellor is trying to hide news like this. Bad publicity. Also, I heard that in February when students receive refund checks, random people will be on campus looking to steal from you. The school is surrounded by the ghetto, so do the math.}",
