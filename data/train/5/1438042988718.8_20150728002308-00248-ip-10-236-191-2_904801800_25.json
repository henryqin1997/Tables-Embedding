    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{223776=The dorms at Xavier University are slightly stricter than dorms at other universities: most times, the floors (wings) are separated by gender; if anyone is caught indulging in underage drinking, they are forced to pay a fine, do community service, and their parents are notified; and dorm parties are usually busted quickly by Resident Assistants (RAs). However, these precautions ensure the safety of all students. Although students of the opposite gender cannot spend the night, they do not have to leave until 2:00 a.m., which is pretty reasonable. We also have a zero-tolerance policy during finals week where no student is allowed to have their door open or be in the hallways; this ensures that all students can focus hard. We do our best to make sure that the majority of students are pleased., 153836=Xavier football: undefeated since 1973 Xavier basketball: unstoppable since, ever. ADP (we will be legends! One day... I promise), 138942=Xavier is a great school that has wonderful opportunities for everyone. Classes are small with one-on-one attention and a 12:1 student to faculty ratio. With the most up to date technology, students are sure that they are get a solid education that is worth their money., 293956=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "The experience of college life at Xavier University is superior. I can not imagine myself at another college that will provide me with the same joy that I get at Xavier. The students are great and the green space provides an excellent place to meet new people and play. Am learning a lot The classes are small and professors are dedicated to giving a one on one experience with the students. I have never been turned down by a professor to meet for further instructions after class. Professor seem to really enjoy their time at Xavier University which drives them to provide superior knowledge.
