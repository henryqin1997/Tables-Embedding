Name origin Tynamo and its evolutionary relatives may be based on electric eels, lampreys, jawless fish and possibly leeches or lancelets. The fact that it is Electric-type may be an allusion to bioelectrogenesis. It also resembles leptocephalus, larval stage of the eel, or also a knifefish. The waving yellow mark running along its body combined with the physical appearance overall makes certain resemblance to Haikouichthys, or even a Crookes tube or a Geissler tube. Tynamo may also be based on a Skyfish, which would explain its Levitate ability. Origin Tynamo's in-game cry sounds strikingly similar to Shinx's, though only in a higher pitch.
