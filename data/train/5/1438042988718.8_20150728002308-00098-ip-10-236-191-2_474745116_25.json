    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{91525=An additional rubber component may also be present in the elastomeric composition of the invention. The rubber may be present in the composition from 0 to 90 phr, from 20 to 80 phr in another embodiment. The transparent elastomeric compositions of the present invention are halogenated isoolefin/para-alkylstyrene terpolymers that can be covulcanized with polybutadiene, polyisoprene, styrene-butadiene rubber, styrene-isoprene-butadiene rubber, isoprene-butadiene rubber, high cis-polybutadiene or natural rubber. Some commercial examples of rubbers are NATSYN\u2122 (Goodyear Chemical Company), natural rubber (SMR 20), and BUDENE\u2122 1207 or BR 1207 (Goodyear Chemical Company). The preferable covulcanate is high cis-polybutadiene (BR). By \u201ccis-polybutadiene\u201d or \u201chigh cis-polybutadiene\u201d, it is meant that 1,4-cis polybutadiene is used, wherein the amount of cis component is at least 95%. An example of high cis-polybutadiene commercial products used in the covulcanized composition BR 1207., 105812=Cure properties were measured using a MDR 2000 at the indicated temperature and 0.5 degree arc. Test specimens were cured at the indicated temperature, typically from 150\ufffd C. to 160\ufffd C., for a time corresponding to T90+appropriate mold lag. When possible, standard ASTM tests were used to determine the cured compound physical properties. Stress/strain properties (tensile strength, elongation at break, modulus values, energy to break) were measured at room temperature using an Instron 4202. Shore A hardness was measured at room temperature by using a Zwick Duromatic. Abrasion loss was determined at room temperature by weight difference by using an APH-40 Abrasion Tester with rotating sample holder (5 N counter balance) and rotating drum. Weight losses were indexed to that of the standard DIN compound with lower losses indicative of a higher abrasion resistance index. The error (2\u03c3) in measuring 100% Modulus is \ufffd0.11 MPa units; the error (2\u03c3) in measuring elongation is \ufffd13% units. The error (2\u03c3) in tensile measurements is \ufffd0.47 MPa units., 124813=The effect of using an alkylperoxide cure system Varox 231XL (R. T. Vanderbilt) in place of the traditional sulfur cure system was studied using an EXXPRO\u2122 elastomer and a mix of other rubbers. Varox 231 XL is 1,1-bis(t-butylperoxyl)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane as 40% active on an inert carrier of calcium carbonate (32%) and silicon dioxide (28%). Tests performed on compositions I1 (sulfur cure) and J1 (alkylperoxide cure) in Table 12 show that the use of a peroxide cure system increases transparency (higher ChromaMeter-L value) and decreases the yellow color (lower ChromaMeter-b* value) compared to the use of a sulfur cure system in a cured compound using FLEXON\u2122 766 as the processing aid. Overall, the use of the alkylperoxide system improves the optical properties of the system when I1 (sulfur cure) is compared to J1 (alkylperoxide cure), but the Din Abrasion index values are relatively low due to the presence of NATSYN\u21222200., 63979=Polybutene and paraffinic-type processing oils have been disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,279,284 to Spadone, U.S. Pat. No. 5,964,969 to Sandstrom et al. and EP 0 314 416 to Mohammed. A paraffinic-type processing oil is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,631,316 to Costemalle et al. Also, WO 94/01295 to Gursky et al. discloses the use of petroleum waxes and naphthenic oils and resins in a rubber composition for tire sidewalls, and U.S. Ser. No. 09/691,764, filed Oct. 18, 2000 (assigned to the assignee of the present invention) to Waddell et al. discloses a colorable rubber compositions. Other disclosures of processing oil or resin-containing elastomeric or adhesive compositions include U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,005,625, 5,013,793, 5,162,409, 5,178,702, 5,234,987, 5,234,987, 5,242,727, 5,397,832, 5,733,621, 5,755,899, EP 0 682 071 A1, EP 0376 558B1, WO 92/16587, and JP11005874, JP05179068A and JO3028244. None of these disclosures solves the problem of improving processability of elastomeric compositions useful for tires, air barriers, etc, while maintaining or improving the air impermeability of those compositions. Further, these materials may not be suitable for applications requiring high abrasion resistance while maintaining the colorability of the composition. Such is the case for, example, tire sidewalls and shoe soles., 76664=Preferred halogenated poly(isobutylene-co-p-methylstyrene) are brominated polymers which generally contain from 0.1 to 5 wt % of bromomethyl groups. In yet another embodiment, the amount of bromomethyl groups is from 0.2 to 2.5 wt %. Expressed another way, preferred copolymers contain from 0.05 up to 2.5 mole % of bromine, based on the weight of the polymer, more preferably from 0.1 to 1.25 mole % bromine, and are substantially free of ring halogen or halogen in the polymer backbone chain. In one embodiment of the invention, the interpolymer is a copolymer of C4 to C7 isomonoolefin derived units, a p-methylstyrene derived units and a p-halomethylstyrene derived units, wherein the p-halomethylstyrene units are present in the interpolymer from 0.4 to 1 mol % based on the interpolymer. In another embodiment, the p-halomethylstyrene is p-bromomethylstyrene. The Mooney Viscosity (1+8, 125\ufffd C., ASTM D1646, modified) is from 30 to 60 MU., 61174=This application claims priority to U.S. application Ser. No. 09/691,764, filed Oct. 18, 2000 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety., 121621=The test compositions U-X in this example are mixtures of EXXPRO\u2122 elastomers and NATSYN\u2122 2200 rubber in the absence of PARAPOL\u2122. Transparent cured EXXPRO\u2122 Elastomer compounds were prepared using precipitated and fumed silicas as the fillers, and a sulfur curing system. All cured compounds were contact transparent, but had a yellow to brown color depending upon the specific ingredients, and afforded compounds with physical properties appropriate for use in a variety of rubber applications. Test compositions U-X are shown in Table 9. The Din Abrasion index values are relatively low when high cis-polybutadiene is not present, although higher than those values in Table 8 when EXXPRO\u2122 Elastomers is the only elastomer/rubber component. Further, in the absence of PARAPOL\u2122, the optical properties are diminished as seen by the lower L values and higher b* values relative to those in, for example, Table 8, compositions O-T., 90148=The elastomeric composition of the invention may include one or more types of polybutene as a mixture, blended either prior to addition to the elastomer, or with the elastomer. The amount and identity (e.g., viscosity, Mn, etc.) of the polybutene processing oil mixture can be varied in this manner. Thus, PARAPOL\u2122 450 can be used when low viscosity is desired in the composition of the invention, while PARAPOL\u2122 2500 can be used when a higher viscosity is desired, or compositions thereof to achieve some other viscosity or molecular weight. In this manner, the physical properties of the composition can be controlled. More particularly, the phrases \u201ca polybutene processing oil\u201d, or \u201cpolybutene processing oil\u201d include a single oil or a composition of two or more oils used to obtain any viscosity or molecular weight (or other property) desired, as specified in the ranges disclosed herein., 68586=The term \u201celastomer\u201d, as used herein, refers to any polymer or composition of polymers consistent with the ASTM D1566 definition. The term \u201celastomer\u201d may be used interchangeably with the term \u201crubber\u201d, as used herein., 128854=Surprisingly, the use of the relatively higher molecular weight PARAPOL\u2122 2500 in place of the PARAPOL\u2122 950 results in reduced yellowing as indicated by the ChromaMeter-b* values, and increased hardness, tensile strength, and elongation at break values. Further, when comparing test composition M1 (PARAPOL\u2122 950 present 10 phr) with test composition P1 (PARAPOL\u2122 2500 present 10 phr), it is found that the viscosity (MV: ML(1+4)) increases with increasing molecular weight of the processing aid. Overall, the use of BR 1207 improves the Din Abrasion index values when compared to the V-X test compositions in Table 9 where the rubber component NATSYN\u2122 is used instead of BR 1207. Further, the optical properties of the compositions M1-P1 are improved as compared to test compositions V-X in Table 9 due to the presence of the PARAPOL\u2122 processing aid in place of the FLEXON\u2122 oil., 126486=The present set of test compositions M1-P1 shows the improved properties of the elastomeric composition when EXXPRO\u2122 elastomers and BR 1207 are used as the primary components with the processing aid PARAPOL\u2122, an alkylperoxide (not associated with a carrier) is used as the cure agent, and Thiate U is used as an accelerator. The example 12 compositions represent the preferred embodiments of the present invention (Table 14)., 80432=One or more cross-linking agents are preferably used in the elastomeric compositions of the present invention. More preferably, the coupling agent is a bifunctional organosilane cross-linking agent. By an \u201corganosilane cross-linking agent\u201d is meant any silane coupled filler and/or cross-linking activator and/or silane reinforcing agent known to those skilled in the art including, but not limited to, vinyl triethoxysilane, vinyl-tris-(beta-methoxyethoxy)silane, methacryloylpropyltrimethoxysilane, gamma-amino-propyl triethoxysilane (sold commercially as A1100 by Witco), gamma-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (A189 by Witco) and the like, and mixtures thereof. In a preferred embodiment, bis-(3(triethoxysilyl)-propyl)-tetrasulfane (sold commercially as Si69 by Degussa) is employed., 116792=Ten curative/accelerator systems thought useful in co-curing with the other sulfur-vulcanized tire compounds were screened. Acceptable curatives were obtained using zinc oxide/stearic acid; zinc oxide/zinc stearate; hexamethylene-1,6-bis(thiosulphate) disodium salt dihydrate (sold commercially as DURALINK HTS\u2122 by Flexsys)/zinc stearate; DURALINK HTS\u2122/zinc oxide; and 1,3-Bis(citraconimidomethyl)benzene (sold commercially as PERKALINK\u2122 900 by Flexsys)/zinc stearate, since their use afforded transparent compounds from nearly colorless to a yellow or beige color. Butyl zimate/zinc stearate afforded a transparent, light brown-colored compound. The use of CBS (N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazole sulfenamide) afforded a beige compound, amylphenyl disulfide polymer (18.5-21% sulfur) (sold commercially as VULTAC 5 by Elf Atochem North America) afforded a gray compound, and A1100 afforded a brown compound; none were visibly transparent based on the ability to read print. Other organic peroxides can be used if they are not carried on a mineral filler such as clay., 84897=Commercial examples of such a processing oil are the PARAPOL\u2122 Series of processing oils (ExxonMobil Chemical Company, Houston Tex.), such as PARAPOL\u2122 450, 700, 950, 1300, 2400 and 2500. The commercially available PARAPOL\u2122 Series of polybutene processing oils are synthetic liquid polybutenes, each individual formulation having a certain molecular weight, all formulations of which can be used in the composition of the invention. The molecular weights of the PARAPOL\u2122 oils are from 420 Mn (PARAPOL\u2122 450) to 2700 Mn (PARAPOL\u2122 2500) as determined by gel permeation chromatography. The MWD (Mw/Mn) of the PARAPOL\u2122 oils range from 1.8 to 3 in one embodiment, and from 2 to 2.8 in another embodiment., 89818=Other properties of PARAPOL\u2122 processing oils are as follows: the density (g/mL) of PARAPOL\u2122 processing oils varies from about 0.85 (PARAPOL\u2122 450) to 0.91 (PARAPOL\u2122 2500). The bromine number (CG/G) for PARAPOL\u2122 oils ranges from 40 for the 450 Mn processing oil, to 8 for the 2700 Mn processing oil., 126944=Brominated poly(isobutylene-co-p-methylstyrene)-containing formulations for tire tread and rubber outsole applications were developed using binary compositions of EXXPRO\u2122 MDX 90-10 with high cis-polybutadiene rubber (BR 1207, BUDENE\u2122 1207). The EXXPRO\u2122 Elastomer is used predominantly for improving traction properties, while the polybutadiene is used to improve abrasion resistance. For shoe soles, polymers were filled with precipitated and fumed silicas in order to reinforce the polymers; but also to maintain good colorability for appearance. A silane coupling agent is used in the present example in order to further increase the abrasion resistance of polybutadiene formulations, but has little effect in EXXPRO\u2122 Elastomers. Thus, processing aids such as PARAPOL\u2122 950 and PARAPOL\u2122 2500 were added as part of the compositions. Table 14 lists the ingredients in test compositions M1-P1 used in testing. Trigonox 29 is an alkyl peroxide made by Akzo Nobel Chemicals, and is 1,1-di-tert-butylperoxy-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane. Trigonox 29, unlike some alkyl peroxides sold commercially is not on a carrier.}",
