The increase in net loss was primarily attributable to the decrease in gross profit and the increase in interest expenses during the year of 2011., 879268=On December 11, 2010, the Company vended out the two subsidiaries, ACUMEDSPA LLC, a Tennessee Limited Liability Company, and CONSUMER CARE OF AMERICA LLC, a Florida Limited Liability Company, pursuant to an Agreement entered between and among OPH and Chinita LLC, a Nevada Limited Liability Company (\u201cBuyer\u201d). Accordingly, the Buyer acquired 100% interest in ACUMEDSPA LLC and 100% interest in CONSUMER CARE OF AMERICA LLC, as well as any and all assets and liabilities in both subsidiaries in exchange for the total payments of not less than Two Hundred dollars ($200). As a result of the transactions consummated at the closing, the purchase gave the Buyer a 'controlling interest' in both subsidiaries; therefore, ACUMEDSPA LLC and CONSUMER CARE OF AMERICA LLC were no longer wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company., 910429=The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of products upon delivery to the customers and the transfer of title and risk of loss. The Company did not record any product returns for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively., 927802=In July 2010, the FASB amended the requirements for Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses. As a result of these amendments, an entity is required to disaggregate by portfolio segment or class certain existing disclosures and provide certain new disclosures about its financing receivables and related allowance for credit losses. The new disclosures as of the end of the reporting period are effective for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2010, while the disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for the first fiscal quarter of 2011. The adoption of this guidance will not impact the Company\u2019s consolidated results of operations or financial position., 48557=For the fiscal year of 2011, we generated revenues of $837,159 and net loss of $469,990. For the fiscal year of 2010, we generated revenues of $1,009,078 and net loss of $353,974. As of December 31, 2011, we had total assets of $243,900, available cash and cash equivalents of $42,651 on hand. We also distribute products through master distributors, which mirror the Matthews store, and through independent retailers such as Ace Hardware locations and garden centers\u00a0throughout the region., 77185=Adding regional sales staff and support staff to expand sales efforts into regional markets up and down the east coast and certain points in the Midwest. This will increase the number of independent retail partners purchasing products from OPH and significantly increase revenues and profits that will be used for further\u00a0expansion\u00a0efforts. We anticipate adding an additional 50-100 retail partners in 2012 if we are partially or fully funded through our current public offering., 352667=In May of 2011, the Company entered into a consulting service agreement with a Consultant for business advisory services in exchange for 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company. The agreement had a term of 6 months effective from May 15, 2011 ending November 15, 2011. The fair value of this stock issuance was determined by the fair value of the Company\u2019s Common Stock on the grant date,\u00a0at a price of approximately $.075 per share. The share value was arrived at based on the facts that the Company had limited trading volume for its stock, and had negative shareholder equity at the time of issuance. Accordingly, the Company calculated the stock based compensation of $75,000 at its fair value and booked pro rata within the relative service periods. The Company relied on exemptions provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company made this offering based on the following facts: (1) the issuance was an isolated private transaction which did not involve a public offering; (2) there was only one offeree, (3) the offeree has agreed to the imposition of a restrictive legend on the face of the stock certificate representing its shares, to the effect that it will not resell the stock unless its shares are registered or an exemption from registration is available; (4) the offeree was a sophisticated investor familiar with us and stock-based transactions; (5) there were no subsequent or contemporaneous public offerings of the stock; (6) the stock was not broken down into smaller denominations; and (7) the negotiations for the sale of the stock took place directly between the offeree and our management., 358932=In August of 2011, 2 investors submitted subscription agreements to the Company regarding the purchase of 650,000 shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock at a price of $.05 per share, or cash payment of total $32,500. The transaction was independently negotiated between the Company and the investors. The Company evaluated the transaction based on the fact that the Company had nominal trading volume for its stock, and had negative shareholder equity at the time entering the subscription agreements. The proceeds from the subscription agreements, which were collected in full during the fourth quarter of 2011, mitigated the Company\u2019s cash pressure in short term. The 650,000 shares have not been granted or issued as of the date of this report., 415107=In 2009 we started with 3 Retail Partners. In 2010 we added 21 Retail Partners. In 2011, we added 6 Retail Partners and stopped selling products to 4 Retail Partners. The failure to achieve greater wholesale growth in 2011 was due to the company\u2019s primary sales person missing a great deal of work time because of serious illness and personal family issues that kept him from achieving our sales objectives.\u00a0, 551381=30600 Telegraph Road, Suite 2175, 86185=Our corporate website will continue to be developed in 2012, as we broaden our resource materials and video library. E-commerce function was added to the website in Q2 2011 to provide for an additional revenue stream.\u00a0 Ecommerce sales in 2011 totaled less than $2,500 with $0 marketing dollars added to promote the shopping function,\u00a0 however increases should begin to occur as the company begins to allocate online-marketing dollars targeted to building the online revenue stream in Q3-Q4 of 2012., 65812=Sales of organic based fertilizers and soil conditioners in the consumer packaged lawn and garden sector are expected to continue to grow at twice the rate of traditional fertilizer sales through 2014. This exhibits growing acceptance and predilection to purchase these types of products over their traditional counterparts., 464417=Net cash used in investing activities was $303 and $411 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, due primarily to purchase of property and equipment in both years., 431132=Management has determined that executing a new packaging strategy will reduce our expenses associated with this part of our operating expenses. We have retained Kaleidoscope-Chicago, a branding and packaging design company to help us with the development of this packaging strategy. This will include pre-printed bags and pre-printed product labels. Not only will this reduce our expenses, it will help us to compete better, head-to\u2013head on retailer shelves. Currently all products labels are printed in-house at greater cost per unit, but with lower upfront costs. We anticipate converting to the new packaging in early 2012. However if we are not able to convert to the new packaging strategy, our expenses will remain higher and this could negatively affect operations, and could cause our end pricing to the retailer to be so high as to not be competitive. This would also affect our revenues and our sell through at the retail level and this could jeopardize the Company\u2019s ability to generate sufficient revenue to continue operations., 424489=ii) Cost of Direct Labor Trends: The current weakened economy has increased the company\u2019s ability to hire and retail direct labor at a reasonable cost. We anticipate this to be consistent through 2012 and into 2013. However, if the economy were to sharply improve our direct labor costs could increase. If this were to occur, it would result in higher direct labor costs and this would have an adverse effect on our operations, as it would reduce our gross profit margins., 486998=The Note is discounted in full amount due to the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock as sweetener to the Note, and a beneficial conversion feature. The fair value of the 1,000,000 shares was $68,245 determined by an arm\u2019s length payable settlement with a non-affiliate since there was nominal trading volume of our common stock in the market, and recorded as discount to note payable, which will be amortized over 2 years starting from January 1, 2011. The remaining discount of $31,755 represented the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion option, which will be amortized over 2 years starting from January 1, 2011. The Company recorded interest expense related to this note of $56,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011., 244417=Section\u00a0404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSection\u00a0404\u201d) required our management to start reporting on the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the years ended December\u00a031, 2011 and 2010. We must continue an ongoing program of system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements. We expect that this program will require us to incur significant expenses and to devote additional resources to Section\u00a0404 compliance on an ongoing annual basis. We cannot predict how regulators will react or how the market prices of our securities will be affected in the event that our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under Section\u00a0404., 32316=As used herein the terms \"We\", the \"Company\", \"OPHI\", the \"Registrant,\" or the \"Issuer\" refers to Organic Plant Health Inc., its subsidiary and predecessors, unless indicated otherwise. The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 5, 2007 and subsequently changed our name to QX Bio-Tech Group, Inc. on October 17, 2007. We further changed our name to Acumedspa Holdings, Inc. on July 30, 2009, and to Organic Plant Health Inc. on December 15, 2010., 432851=Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $77,549, increased by $42,653, or approximately 122.2%, compared to interest expense of $34,896 for the year ended December 31, 2010. An\u00a0increase in interest expenses in 2011 was due primarily to interest charges on a convertible promissory note in amount of $100,000 (the \u201cNote\u201d), dated January 1, 2011. The Note bears interest at a rate of 6% per annum and is discounted in full amount due to the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock as sweetener to the Note, and a beneficial conversion feature. The fair value of the 1,000,000 shares was $68,245 determined by an arm\u2019s length payable settlement with a non-affiliate since there was nominal trading volume of our common stock in the market, and recorded as discount to note payable, which will be amortized over 2 years starting from January 1, 2011. The remaining discount of $31,755 represented the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion option. Pursuant to the Note, all or any portion of the accrued interest and unpaid principal balance of the Note is convertible at the option of the holder into the Common Stock of the Company or its successors, at Ten Cents ($.10) per share, no sooner than September 30, 2012. We recorded interest expense from the Note of $56,000 during the year of 2011., 36089=On December 10, 2010, the Company entered into a Plan of Exchange agreement (the \u201cPlan of Exchange\u201d) with the members of OPH and Mr. Sperber, pursuant to which the Company acquired 100% of the membership interests of OPH in exchange for a transfer of 3,985,000 shares of the Company\u2019s Convertible Preferred Stock to OPH Members, which gave OPH Members a controlling interest in the Company, representing approximately 76.47% of the then issued and outstanding shares on a dilutive basis. OPH and the Company were hereby reorganized, such that the Company acquired 100% of the ownership of OPH, and OPH became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company., 931524=In December 2011, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2011-11, \u201cBalance Sheet - Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities\u201d to enhance disclosure requirements relating to the offsetting of assets and liabilities on an entity's balance sheet. The update requires enhanced disclosures regarding assets and liabilities that are presented net or gross in the statement of financial position when the right of offset exists, or that are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement. The new disclosure requirements relating to this update are retrospective and effective for annual and interim periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. The update only requires additional disclosures, as such, the Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition., 488086=The carry value of the Note was $50,000 as of December 31, 2011. The 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock were issued on May 13, 2011., 508666=We had cash of $42,651 on hand as of December 31, 2011. Currently, we do not have enough cash to fund our operations for the next 12 months. This is based on current negative cash flows from operation and working capital deficit. Therefore, we will need to obtain additional capital through equity or debt financing to sustain operations for an additional year. Our current level of operations would require capital of approximately $500,000 per year starting in 2011. Modifications to our business plans may require additional capital for us to operate. For example, if we are unable to raise additional capital in the future we may need to curtail our number of product offers or limit our marketing efforts to the most profitable geographical areas. This may result in lower revenues and market share for us. In addition, there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us when needed or available on terms favorable to us., 504956=The Company has a loan payable to US Green Pros, LLC at an interest rate of 5.5% per annum and which is due in full on May 17, 2016. The balance of this loan was $42,500 as of December 31, 2011, of which $40,000 was received during the second quarter of 2011. Accordingly, the Company recorded interest expenses of $0 during the year ended December 31, 2011. Interest will begin to accrue on January 1, 2012., 20878=The discussion contained in this 10-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The issuer's actual results could differ significantly from those discussed herein. These include statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future, which we indicate by words or phrases such as \"anticipate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"will,\" \"we believe,\" \"the Company believes,\" \"management believes\" and similar language, including those set forth in the discussions under \"Notes to Financial Statements\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation\" as well as those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We base our forward-looking statements on information currently available to us, and we assume no obligation to update them. Statements contained in this Form 10-K that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements that are subject to the \"safe harbor\" created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995., 18748=The aggregate market value of the voting stock on March 31, 2012 (consisting of Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share) held by non-affiliates was approximately $2,959,711 based upon the most recent sales price ($0.185) for such Common Stock on said date March 31, 2012, there were 61,215,081shares of our Common Stock issued and outstanding, of which approximately 15,998,436 shares were held by non-affiliates., 901231=The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB ASC (\u201cParagraph 820-10-35-37\u201d) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in U.S. GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:, 233776=From inception through December, 2011, we have incurred an accumulated net loss of approximately $1,251,436. The revenues have not yet resulted in our earning a profit, and we will continue to incur significant losses for at least the near future. There is no assurance that our operations will ever become profitable., 415848=Management believes that the extenuating circumstances mentioned above, in large part, prevented the Company from generating incremental revenue growth in 2011. Further, if we receive partial or full funding from current public offering, management plans to hire additional sales and support staff that are expected to bring on new retail partners, generating an additional $500,000.00 to $1,100,000.00 in additional wholesale revenue, (based on the average retail partner purchasing $11,673.00 or more annually)., 346935=As of March 31, 2012, we had 602 common shareholders of record., 555426=In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Organic Plant Health, Inc. as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of its consolidated operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles., 293949=Section \"15(g)\" of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Regulation Section \"240.15g(c)2\" of the SEC require broker dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investor\u2019s account. Potential investors in the Company\u2019s common shares are urged to obtain and read such disclosure carefully before purchasing any common shares that are deemed to be \"penny stock\"., 504130=In addition, the Company had outstanding balances of $60,884 due to the Company\u2019s President as of December 31, 2011. The funds borrowed from the Company\u2019s President were to fund the Company\u2019s operations. The loan agreement was not evidenced by any promissory note, but rather a verbal agreement between the President and the Company. The note is due on demand. Accordingly, the Company recorded interest expenses of $3,584 and $3,239 during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively., 52495=At present, organic fertilizer products represent a small share of the approximately $9 billion consumer packaged lawn and garden market in the U.S., roughly 10%, or $900 million. Since 2007 organic fertilizers and growing media revenues have grown at over 10%, annually, over the past several years, which is greater than twice the average rate for the category of about 4% over the same time periods. Demand for these types of products has increased as consumers are generally becoming more aware of the environment and the negative effects from using synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, such as contamination of waterways attributed to chemical fertilizers. The same study notes that Baby-boomers are just coming in to their gardening years, and this will support continued growth in the sector.\u00a0, 489390=(5) The Company has a loan payable to Mark Blumberg (\u201cMr. Blumberg\u201d), a former member of the Company, at an interest rate of 5.75% per annum and due on October 1, 2015. The loan was due to the redemption of Mr. Blumberg\u2019s membership of the Company pursuant to a settlement agreement entered on January 1, 2011. The balance of this loan was $96,823 as of December 31, 2011, of which $12,697 was classified as short-term loan payable. The Company recorded interest expenses of $5,886 during the year ended December 31, 2011., 142837=In fiscal 2011, our top 5 customers purchased product from us as follows:, 466679=We believe that we currently maintain good business relationships with our local banks and note holders. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, our outstanding loans payable to non-affiliates on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were as follows:, 919258=For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company did not have any interest and penalties associated with tax positions. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company did not have any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions., 465284=Net cash provided by financing activities was $303,547 for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to net cash of\u00a0$20,511 used in financial activities during the year of 2010. Positive cash flows from financing activities in 2011 were due primarily to the proceeds from notes payable in an amount of $182,500, of which $42,500 from related parties, and the proceeds from stock issuance in amount of 205,482, offset by the payments of total $84,435 to notes payable, of which $22,500 was in connection with related parties\u2019 loan. Negative cash flows from financing activities in 2010 was due to the payments of total $40,511 to notes payable, offset by the proceeds of $20,000 from related parties loan., 484038=(2) The Company has loan payable to Bank of North Carolina at an interest rate of 6.5% per annum and due on June 30, 2013. The balance of this bank loan was $66,337 as of December 31, 2011, of which $48,237 was classified as short-term loan payable. The Company recorded interest expenses of $4,968 and $13,551 during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively., 507264=We project that we will need additional capital to fund operations over the next 12 months. We anticipate we will need a minimum of $500,000 additional funds for the year of 2012 to meet our expansion objectives., 236231=As reflected in our financial statements, for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we incurred net losses of $469,990 and $353,974, respectively, and as of December 31, 2011, had an accumulated deficit of $1,251,436, and had a working capital deficiency of $437,213. We will need additional capital and/or increased sales to execute our business strategy, and if we are unsuccessful in either raising additional capital or achieving desired sales levels we will be unable to fully execute our business strategy on a timely basis, if at all. If we raise additional capital through the issuance of debt securities, the debt securities may be secured and any interest payments would reduce the amount of cash available to operate and grow our business. If we raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities, such issuances will likely cause dilution to our stockholders, particularly if we are required to do so during periods when our common stock is trading at historically low price levels., 507804=Overall, we have funded our cash needs from inception through December 31, 2011 with a series of debt and equity transactions, primarily with related parties. If we are unable to receive additional cash from our related parties, we may need to rely on financing from outside sources through debt or equity transactions. Our related parties are under no legal obligation to provide us with capital infusions. Failure to obtain such financing could have a material adverse effect on operations and financial condition., 484741=(3) On January 1, 2011, the Company entered into a convertible promissory note (the Note) in a principal amount of $100,000 payable to Greentree Financial Group (\u201cGreentree\u201d), which bears an interest rate of 6% per annum and is due on January 1, 2013. Pursuant to the Note, Greentree has an option to convert all or any portion of the accrued interest and unpaid principal balance of the Note into the Common Stock of the Company or its successors, at Ten Cents ($.10) per share, no sooner than September 30, 2012. The conversion price associated with the Note was determined based on the facts that the Company had nominal trading volume for its stock, and had negative shareholder equity at the time of issuance., 372819=Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company extends unsecured credit to its customers in the ordinary course of business but mitigates the associated risks by performing credit checks and actively pursuing past due accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is established and determined based on managements\u2019 assessment of known requirements, aging of receivables, payment history, the customer\u2019s current credit worthiness and the economic environment. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had allowances for uncollectible accounts of $2,577 and $2,332, respectively., 434506=In addition, we have a loan payable to Mark Blumberg (\u201cMr. Blumberg\u201d), a former member of the Company, at an interest rate of 5.75% per annum and due on October 1, 2015. The loan was due to the redemption of Mr. Blumberg\u2019s membership of the Company pursuant to a settlement agreement entered on January 1, 2011. We recorded interest expenses of $5,886 during the year ended December 31, 2011., 503183=In July 2009, the Company\u2019s shareholders made several loans in total amount of $275,000 to the Company to fund its operations. The shareholder loans were evidenced by promissory notes due in July 2012, with interest at the floating interest rate of Prime plus 2.5%. The interest rate will be adjusted each calendar quarter of January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1. The principal balance of the shareholder loans was $55,800 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Accordingly, the Company recorded interest expenses of $3,209 and $15,341 during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively., 156350=2011, 38148=OPH was originally founded in Charlotte, NC in 2007 by Billy Styles and Alan Talbert. The business produces and distributes organic based fertilizers and soil conditioners for use in the continual care of residential and commercial landscapes., 905163=The Company does not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or a non-recurring basis, consequently, the Company did not have any fair value adjustments for assets and liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2011 nor gains or losses are reported in the statement of operations that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities still held at the reporting date for the for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively., 558019=March 26, 2012, 518769=We are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates. The interest payable under our credit facility, under which we had $30,137 at December 31, 2011, is based on a specified bank\u2019s prime interest rate and, therefore, is affected by changes in market interest rates. Historically, the effects of movements in the market interest rates have been immaterial to our operating results, as we have not borrowed to any significant degree until 2011. In 2011, we incurred significant debt from loans by convertible notes payable to non-affiliates and notes payable to our related parties. This debt has fixed rates of interest and in management\u2019s opinion does not represent a material market risk., 348561=On February 28, 2011, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the issuance of 4,075,000 shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock in exchange for cash payment of $75,000 made by an investor. The transaction was independently negotiated between the Company and the investor. The Company evaluated the transaction based on the fact that the Company had nominal trading volume for its stock, and had negative shareholder equity at the time of issuance. The proceeds from this issuance mitigated the Company\u2019s cash pressure in short term., 288092=During 2011, we issued a significant number of shares of our common stock, preferred stock convertible into shares of our common stock, and convertible notes that may be converted into our common stock in connection with various financings and the repayment of debt, and we anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. The additional shares of our common stock issued and to be issued in the future upon the conversion of debt could cause the market price of our common stock to decline, and could have an adverse effect on our earnings per share if and when we become profitable., 61819=We belief that very few companies of our size have had the level of local and, in some cases, national exposure on radio and television. The company currently has it's own radio show, \u201cBackyard Styles\u201d, hosted by Billy Styles, and airing on WBT-AM 1110, a 50,000 watt radio station located in Charlotte, NC. We have also developed marketing agreements with production companies that allow Mr. Styles to be the resident Organic Gardener appearing on frequent episodes of the nationally syndicated \u201cFor Your Home\u201d television show, which airs in 90 million homes across the country., 350443=On May 13, 2011, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company as sweetener to Greentree pursuant to a Convertible Promissory Note (the Note), dated January 1, 2011. The Note in a principal amount of $100,000 bears an interest rate of 6% per annum and is due on January 1, 2013. Pursuant to the Note, Greentree has an option to convert all or any portion of the accrued interest and unpaid principal balance of the Note into the common stock of the Company or its successors, at Ten Cents ($.10) per share, no sooner than September 30, 2012. The Company relied on exemptions provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company made this offering based on the following facts: (1) the issuance was an isolated private transaction which did not involve a public offering; (2) there was only one offeree, (3) the offeree has agreed to the imposition of a restrictive legend on the face of the stock certificate representing its shares, to the effect that it will not resell the stock unless its shares are registered or an exemption from registration is available; (4) the offeree was a sophisticated investor familiar with us and stock-based transactions; (5) there were no subsequent or contemporaneous public offerings of the stock; (6) the stock was not broken down into smaller denominations; and (7) the negotiations for the sale of the stock took place directly between the offeree and our management., 349487=On March 31, 2011, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock to settle accounts payable of $68,245 to a non-related party. The transaction was independently negotiated between the Company and the creditor. The Company evaluated the transaction based on the fact that the Company had nominal trading volume for its stock, and had negative shareholder equity at the time of issuance. The settlement of the accounts payable through the issuance of common stock preserved the limited cash available currently in the Company., 490700=In addition, we had outstanding balances on our notes payable to related parties of the following amounts as of December 31, 2011 and 2010:, 520992=Audited Financial Summary Information for the Years Ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, 47703=We began this process in August of 2011 with initial meetings and conference calls to establish a direction for the new brand identity that would convey the company\u2019s experience, knowledge and passion for helping growers of all varieties grow \u2013 from the 35-year old magazine executive concerned about indoor plant care to the 50-year old caretaker of his family\u2019s 500 acre farm. This process has advanced over the past few months to the design stage. We plan to launch the new brand identity and package design during Q2 2012., 553198=We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Organic Plant Health, Inc. and Subsidiary as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders\u2019 deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits., 943833=Inventory was comprised of the following as of December 31, 2011 and 2010:, 458985=Accounts Receivables increased during the year ended December 31, 2011 as the result of sales on account to new wholesale customers and one wholesale distributor that did not purchase products during the comparable period in 2010. This number was also elevated because a wholesale distributor was overdue on his payment to the company. Had the distributor paid the invoice when due, the accounts receivable number for the year ended December 31, 2011 would have been reduced by about $12,000.\u00a0 Subsequently, the $12,000 has been collected in full as of the year ended December 31, 2011., 403394=Revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $837,159 and $1,009,078, respectively, including licensing revenue of $42,788 and $32,083, respectively. The decrease in 2011 by $171,919, or approximately 17.0%, was due to the impact from changes in our business model / marketing strategy, and simultaneous effects from a weakening economy. Management believes that the effects from the ongoing recession or weakened economy will continue to hamper growth unless the Company increases the number of retail partners purchasing products on a consistent basis. Further, management believes that the receipt of partial or full funding from current public offering will enable the Company to expand the Company\u2019s sales efforts on increasing the number of retail partners. In that case, new revenues over the next 18-24 months will be expected to grow at a pace greater than our operating expenses and bring about profitability. However, there is no assurance that revenues will grow and there is reason to believe that sales will continue to decline under the current economic climate., 913583=The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair value method following the guidance set forth in ASC 718-10 for disclosure about Stock-Based Compensation. This section requires a public entity to measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which a consultant is required to provide service in exchange for the award within the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which consultants do not render the requisite service. During the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company recorded $75,000 and $50,000, respectively, in compensation expense based on the fair value of services rendered in exchange for common shares issued to the consultants. These approximated the fair value of the shares at the dates of issuances., 67576=We have developed a positive reputation over the last several years in the greens industry in the region. Billy Styles, our president and CEO, is well known for his industry knowledge, decades of field experience, and passion for helping others learn about the true nature of soil and plant health in the region. Billy is frequently called upon to consult with greens industry professionals about problems they face in managing landscape care. He also meets frequently with garden clubs, as well as local and regional associations geared towards promoting sustainable maintenance practices inside and outside of the home and business. One example of the latter is Billy\u2019s involvement with the Union County Neighborhood Leaders Forum, (UCNLF) \u2013 he was the keynote speaker at the UCNLF Spring Conference in 2011., 66484=\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sales of organic based fertilizers and soil conditioner have experienced 5%-10% growth annually in the past 4 years, and it is expected to continue to grow at more than twice the average growth rate of traditional fertilizers (3.5% - 4% through 2014). (Source: http://www.marketresearch.com/Freedonia-Group-Inc-v1247/Lawn-Garden-Consumables-2688161., 19378=Number of shares of common stock, par value $.001, outstanding as of March 31, 2012: 61,215,081, 456312=\u00a0* The above financial data have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.\u00a0, 354694=During the second quarter of 2011, the Board of Directors of the Company sold a total of 727,578 shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock in exchange for cash payments of $65,482 made by investors. We will use the proceeds from this offering for working capital purposes.\u00a0\u00a0We relied on exemptions provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We made this offering based on the following facts: (1) the issuance was an isolated private transaction which did not involve a public offering; (2) there were 18 offerees, (3) the offerees have agreed to the imposition of a restrictive legend on the face of the stock certificate representing the shares indicating the stock cannot be resold unless registered or an exemption from registration is available; (4) the offerees were sophisticated investors familiar with our company and stock-based transactions; (5) there were no subsequent or contemporaneous public offerings of the stock; (6) the stock was not broken down into smaller denominations; and (7) the negotiations for the sale of the stock took place directly between the offerees and our management., 930315=In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU\u00a02011-08 which provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two-step test for goodwill impairment.\u00a0\u00a0If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required.\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise, no further testing is required. The revised standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.\u00a0\u00a0 The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition., 225873=We have limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects. We may not be successful in our efforts to grow our business and to earn increased revenues. We had accumulated deficit of $1,251,436 as of December, 2011, and had net losses of $469,990 for the year ended December 31, 2011. An investment in our securities represents significant risk and you may lose all or part your entire investment. \u00a0, 889881=Inventories consist of finished goods and are valued at lower of cost or market value, cost being determined on the first-in, first-out method.\u00a0\u00a0The Company periodically reviews historical sales activity to determine excess, slow moving items and potentially obsolete items and also evaluates the impact of any anticipated changes in future demand.\u00a0\u00a0The Company provides inventory allowances based on excess and obsolete inventories determined principally by customer demand.\u00a0\u00a0 As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company did not record an allowance for obsolete inventories. The Company has periodically written off obsolete inventory. Inventory write-offs totaled $2,557 during the year ended December 31, 2011., 420530=Our cost of goods sold consists primarily of costs of raw materials and direct labor, and other costs directly attributable to the production of our products. Write-down of inventories to lower of cost or market is also recorded in cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $362,344, decreased by $103,626, or approximately 22.2% from $465,970 for the year ended December 31, 2010. Such decrease was due to a decrease in retail sales at our Matthews store during 2011, and the sales from our Retail Partners did not pick up due to the economy. We experienced a slightly higher cost on certain commodity components, and reduced costs on certain other commodity components in 2011. Commodity components that increased in cost include a pasteurized poultry litter base that provides a source of organic nutrients, (Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium), as well as beneficial bacteria and micorrhizal fungi, which add bio-diversity to the soil. Commodity components that decreased in cost include one source or organic acids (Humic Acid and Fulvic Acid derived from plant extracts). Although we achieved a greater impact in overall retail sales for the region, fewer of those retail sales occurred at our Matthews retail store. As referenced above, we believe the long-term gross revenues from our increasing number of wholesale customers will far exceed the sales potential at our Matthews\u2019 retail store, simply because adding additional wholesale partners is much faster and significantly less costly than expanding our existing retail store, or opening additional brick and mortar retail stores., 874561=Organic Plant Health, LLC, (referred to herein as \u201cOPH\u201d), a North Carolina Limited Liability Company, was originally founded in Charlotte, NC in 2007 by Billy Styles and Alan Talbert. The business produces and distributes organic based fertilizers and soil conditioners for use in the continual care of residential and commercial landscapes., 428106=Our gross profit is obtained based upon our total revenues minus our cost of goods sold for a particular period. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $474,815, decreased by $68,293, or approximately 12.6% from $543,108 for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily attributable to the increase in less profitable wholesale sales to our retail partners compared to 2010 and a decrease in the more profitable retail sales from our Matthews retail store. Gross profits also continue to be adversely affected by ongoing effects from the recession. We expect the recession to continue to impact sales and gross profits negatively over the nest 2-3 years. Even if the economy recovers more quickly than expected, there is no assurance that sales and gross profits will increase., 294898=Moreover, Regulation Section \"240.15g-9\" of the SEC requires broker dealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor. This procedure requires the broker dealer to: (a) obtain from the investor information concerning his or her financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives; (b) reasonably determine, based on that information, that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor and that the investor has sufficient knowledge and experience as to be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny stock transactions; (c) provide the investor with a written statement setting forth the basis on which the broker dealer made the determination in (ii) above; and (d) receive a signed and dated copy of such statement from the investor confirming that it accurately reflects the investor\u2019s financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives. Compliance with these requirements may make it more difficult for investors in the Company\u2019s common shares to resell their common shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them. Security holders should be aware that, according to Securities and Exchange Commission Release No. 34-29093, dated April 17, 1991, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include:, 357452=In July of 2011, the Board of Directors of the Company sold a total of 1,300,000 shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock in exchange for cash payments of $65,000 made by investors. We will use the proceeds from this offering for working capital purposes.\u00a0We relied on exemptions provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We made this offering based on the following facts: (1) the issuance was an isolated private transaction which did not involve a public offering; (2) there were 4 offerees, (3) the offerees have agreed to the imposition of a restrictive legend on the face of the stock certificate representing the shares indicating the stock cannot be resold unless registered or an exemption from registration is available; (4) the offerees were sophisticated investors familiar with our company and stock-based transactions; (5) there were no subsequent or contemporaneous public offerings of the stock; (6) the stock was not broken down into smaller denominations; and (7) the negotiations for the sale of the stock took place directly between the offerees and our management., 966343=The Company had outstanding balances on its notes payable of the following amounts as of December 31, 2011 and 2010:, 363103=Certain statements in this report, including statements of our expectations, intentions, plans and beliefs, including those contained in or implied by \"Management's Discussion and Analysis\" and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, are \"forward-looking statements\", within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), that are subject to certain events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control. The words \u201cbelieve\u201d, \u201cexpect\u201d, \u201canticipate\u201d, \u201coptimistic\u201d, \u201cintend\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d, and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements of management's plans and objectives for our future operations and statements of future economic performance, information regarding our expansion and possible results from expansion, our expected growth, our capital budget and future capital requirements, the availability of funds and our ability to meet future capital needs, the realization of our deferred tax assets, and the assumptions described in this report underlying such forward-looking statements. Actual results and developments could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such statements due to a number of factors, including, without limitation, those described in the context of such forward-looking statements, our expansion strategy, our ability to achieve operating efficiencies, our dependence on distributors, capacity, suppliers, industry pricing and industry trends, evolving industry standards, domestic and international regulatory matters, general economic and business conditions, the strength and financial resources of our competitors, our ability to find and retain skilled personnel, the political and economic climate in which we conduct operations and the risk factors described from time to time in our other documents and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"Commission\"). Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: 1) our ability to successfully develop and deliver our products on a timely basis and in the prescribed condition; 2) our ability to compete effectively with other companies in the same industry; 3) our ability to raise sufficient capital in order to effectuate our business plan; and 4) our ability to retain our key executives., 370649=The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of products upon delivery to the customers and the transfer of title and risk of loss. The Company did not record any product returns for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively., 144092=12 months\u00a0ended December 31,\u00a02011, 172789=As of\u00a0December 31, 2011,\u00a0we have the following intellectual property rights:, 457142=Net cash used in operating activities was $267,218 and $1,710 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Negative cash flows from operation during the year ended December 31, 2011 was due primarily to the net loss of $469,990, the increase in accounts receivable in an amount of $43,470 and the decrease in account payable by $97,244, partially offset by the decrease in inventory by $87,380, the increase in accrued expense and deferred revenue in amount of $15,531 and $37,212, respectively, and the non-cash expenses in total of $157,829, which included bad debt expenses of $2,720, depreciation of $30,109, amortization of discount to note payable in amount of $50,000, and common stock issued for services rendered in an amount of $75,000. We issued 1,000,000 shares of common stock to a consultant for business advisory services in a term of six months effective from May 15, 2011 ending November 15, 2011. The shares were valued at $.075 per share based on the facts that we had nominal trading volume for our stock, and had negative shareholder equity at the time entering the agreement. Comparatively, negative cash flows in 2010 were due primarily to the net loss of $353,974, partially offset by the non-cash expenses in total of $82,725, the decrease in accounts receivable and inventory in the amount of $21,860 and $96,502, respectively, and the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the amount of $104,226 and $15,254, respectively., 935605=Accounts receivable was comprised of the following amounts as of December 31, 2011 and 2010:, 44349=We began transitioning to the manufacturing/distribution model in the fall of 2009. The company was profitable in 2007 and 2008, however, it was not profitable from 2009 through 2011. We had net loss of $469,990 in 2011. The Company currently sells its exclusive products through 30+ retail partners. Although, we have not added as many retail partners as initially planned due to the limited cash flow available to support an experienced sales staff, we have experienced some measure of success with the new business model and believe it is viable and will become profitable in the next 18 to 24 months, if partially or fully funded from our current public offering. Without receiving any funding from this offering, we will have to make significant changes in our operations to sustain the business. We further believe that we will need a minimum of $500,000 over the next 6 to 10 months to achieve our initial expansion goals.\u00a0, 488544=(4) The Company has loan payable to NEKCO, LLC in amount of $40,000 (\u201cPrincipal Amount\u201d) due on April 21, 2012 (\u201cMaturity Date\u201d). Interest will accrue on the unpaid balance of the Principal Amount from December 21, 2011 until the maturity date of April 21, 2012, at the fixed rate of 20.0% calculated on the basis of a flat interest payment if the loan is repaid on or before Maturity Date. Accordingly, the Company recorded interest expense of $241 related to this note during the year ended December 31, 2011., 6737=(704) 841-1066, 156162=12\u00a0months ended\u00a0December 31,, 33237=On July 1, 2009, the Company entered into a Plan of Exchange between the Company, Acumedspa Group LLC (\u201cAcuMed\u201d), a Florida corporation, and Consumer Care of America LLC (\u201cCCA\u201d), a Florida corporation, pursuant to which the Company acquired 100% of the capital stock of AcuMed and 100% of the capital stock of CCA in exchange for an issuance by the Company of 6,200,000 new shares of Common Stock of the Company to the Shareholders of AcuMed and CCA. The Plan of Exchange was approved by the Board of Directors and the Majority Shareholders of the Company on July 1, 2009., 18237=The Registrant\u2019s revenues for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 were $837,159., 374187=Inventories consist of finished goods and are valued at lower of cost or market value, cost being determined on the first-in, first-out method.\u00a0\u00a0The Company periodically reviews historical sales activity to determine excess, slow moving items and potentially obsolete items and also evaluates the impact of any anticipated changes in future demand.\u00a0\u00a0The Company provides inventory allowances based on excess and obsolete inventories determined principally by customer demand.\u00a0\u00a0 As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company did not record an allowance for obsolete inventories. The Company has periodically written off obsolete inventory. Inventory write-offs totaled $2,557 during the year ended December 31, 2011., 429651=Our operating expenses were $867,256 for the year ended December 31, 2011, approximately equal to as operating expenses in 2010, which was $862,211. Our fixed expenses remained fairly constant from year to year. We realized some savings as the result of lower sales activity in 2011, such as the decrease in salaries by $78,856. We are working to reduce some of the fixed expenses to maintain positive cash flow during 2011. However, the reduction in fixed expenses was offset by the additional expenses incurred as a result of becoming a publicly traded company in the United States. Such increase included legal service fees, audit fees and other cash or non-cash payments for professional services. In addition, we expect an increase in overall expenses during 2012 due to the plan to hire 2-3 new sales employees. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to hire new sales and support staff, and this could negatively affect our ability to generate new sales for the period and this could impact the Company\u2019s operations and ability to continue operations., 405262=i) Economic Trends: Management conservatively expects that effects from the recession will continue to linger through 2012 and into 2013. Lingering effects from the recession could continue to adversely affect revenues and gross profits, and if this occurs it could adversely affect the company\u2019s ability to continue operations., 43006=After achieving some success and increasing revenues with the basic retail model in 2007 and 2008, we began to feel the effects from the recession in early 2009, and by June of 2009, we recognized that the recession would be protracted and would likely continue to have a negative impact on our business. In July of 2009 we brought on minor investors, and jointly decided that our best opportunity for prolonged growth and expansion with the least amount of capital was to change the business model from basic retail to a more traditional manufacturer/distributor model. This growth strategy change would lessen our cost of expansion, otherwise, (appx. $250,000.00 - $300,000.00 annually, per retail store if we had stayed with the previous business model), and allow us to expand faster, and over a larger area by selling our exclusive products through independent retail partners. These retail partners, existing businesses with built-in consumer traffic, consist of hardware stores, garden centers and nurseries., 154770=In fiscal 2011, our top 5 suppliers sold products to us as follows:, 875284=On December 10, 2010, OPH entered into a Plan of Exchange agreement (the \u201cPlan of Exchange\u201d) between and among the members of OPH (\u201cOPH Members\u201d) and Acumedspa Holdings, Inc., (herein referred to as the Company), a publically traded Nevada corporation, and its majority shareholder, Mr. Brian Sperber., 873713=FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010, 413983=The above chart shows a decline in retail sales at the Matthews Retail Store, with an offsetting increase in Wholesale sales. Although the offset shown here is not balanced, it does illustrate the trend we expect to continue, with one caveat \u2013 we anticipate that annual retail sales will level off by the end of 2013, as we do not anticipate adding more retail partners in the Charlotte NC metro area after that time. Thus, assuming a strengthening economy, retail sales will likely rebound slightly at the Matthews Retail store, while wholesale revenues should continue to climb. Although management believes this is the trend, there is no assurance that this trend will continue, and there is no assurance that revenues, in general, will not continue to decline in the current economic climate., 216246=Generally speaking, since at least 2008, global market and economic conditions have been disrupted and volatile. Concerns over increased energy costs increased commodities costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, the U.S. mortgage market and a declining residential real estate market in the U.S. have contributed to this increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward. These factors, combined with volatile oil prices, declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment, have precipitated a global recession. It is difficult to predict how long the current economic conditions will persist, whether they will deteriorate further, and which of our products, if not all of them, will be adversely affected. These conditions, if they continue, could cause a material decrease in our sales, net income and an increase in the prices we pay for raw materials we use in producing our organic-based and natural fertilizer products and, thus, materially affect our operating results and financial condition., 542391=FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010, 928929=In January 2010, the\u00a0FASB\u00a0issued authoritative guidance regarding fair value measures and disclosures. The guidance requires disclosure of significant transfers between level\u00a01 and level\u00a02 fair value measurements along with the reason for the transfer. An entity must also separately report purchases, sales, issuances and settlements within the level\u00a03 fair value roll forward. The guidance further provides clarification of the level of disaggregation to be used within the fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and clarified the disclosures required for the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure level\u00a02 or level\u00a03 fair value measurements. This new authoritative guidance is effective for the Company in fiscal years beginning after December\u00a015, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance will not impact the Company\u2019s consolidated results of operations or financial position., 375679=The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair value method following the guidance set forth in ASC 718-10 for disclosure about Stock-Based Compensation. This section requires a public entity to measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which a consultant is required to provide service in exchange for the award within the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which consultants do not render the requisite service. During the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company recorded $75,000 and $50,000, respectively, in compensation expense based on the fair value of services rendered in exchange for common shares issued to the consultants. These approximated the fair value of the shares at the dates of issuances., 234923=There exists substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm has added an emphasis of matter paragraph to their report for our fiscal years ended December\u00a031, 2010 and 2011 with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. If we became unable to continue as a going concern, we would have to liquidate our assets and we might receive significantly less than the values at which they are carried on our consolidated financial statements. The inclusion of a going concern modification in our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s audit opinion for the years ended December\u00a031, 2010 and 2011 may materially and adversely affect our stock or our ability to raise new capital., 102614=Our current production equipment and components are adequate to meet current demand and limited future demand. However, to meet the demand anticipated later in 2012 and beyond, based on the planned expansion of our sales efforts, we will need to move to a larger production and warehouse facility, or take advantage of outsourcing some or all of our manufacturing to ensure that we can consistently meet the demand of our customers. This larger facility will provide greater warehousing space for excess inventory, and staging of product for delivery or distribution. This larger facility will also allow us to increase production capacity to service the retail partners in the Carolina\u2019s region. Additionally, we may take advantage of outsourcing the production of some or all of our products, (according to our exact specifications) to meet demand during peak seasons, to fulfill larger orders more quickly, or to allow more efficient distribution into other parts of the country. All of these scenarios enable us to meet the demand for our products without over-taxing our own production facility. Outside of the Carolina\u2019s region, we\u2019ll use some outsourcing of our manufacturing along with bonded warehouses for storage of excess inventory, staging for localized delivery and distribution, and potentially, online sales order processing in those markets where it creates a cost savings for us., 124257=The following table lists our product categories and their respective contribution to our sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011., 888513=Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company extends unsecured credit to its customers in the ordinary course of business but mitigates the associated risks by performing credit checks and actively pursuing past due accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is established and determined based on managements\u2019 assessment of known requirements, aging of receivables, payment history, the customer\u2019s current credit worthiness and the economic environment. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had allowances for uncollectible accounts of $2,577 and $2,332, respectively., 34225=AcuMed and CCA were subsequently vended out after the completion of the stock exchange transaction (the \u201cTransaction\u201d) between the Company and Organic Plant Health, LLC (referred to herein as \u201cOPH\u201d), a North Carolina Limited Liability Corporation located in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Transaction between the Company and OPH had been accounted for as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization of the Company and resulted in the change of control in the Company. Pursuant to an Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d), dated December 11, 2010, between and among the Company and Mr. Brian Sperber, an prior director and prior majority shareholder of the Company (\u201cMr. Sperber\u201d), Mr. Sperber acquired 100% interest in the common shares of AcuMed, as well as assumed any and all liabilities of AcuMed in exchange for the payment of good and valuable consideration of not less than One Hundred dollars ($100), and acquired 100% interest in the common shares of CCA, as well as assumed any and all liabilities of Consumer Care Of America LLC in exchange for the payment of good and valuable consideration of not less than One Hundred dollars ($100). As a result of the transactions consummated at the closing, the purchase gave Mr. Sperber a 'controlling interest' in Acumedspa LLC and Consumer Care Of America LLC, both of which was no longer wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company. The Agreement was approved by the Board of Directors of the Company on December 11, 2010., 408152=In order to reduce the impact from financial crisis, our management decided to shift our business model in 2009 to include new distribution through established retail outlets such as hardware stores, independent garden centers and nurseries, referred as our \u201cRetail Partners\u201d. We believe these Retail Partners enable us to expand awareness and distribution of our exclusive products, while maximizing sales through the added exposure to the Retail Partner\u2019s existing customer base. However, the increase in numbers of Retail Partners in the Charlotte area has an adverse effect on retail sales at the Matthews retail store, because of the close proximity, and causes the decrease in our total revenue during the short term. We believe the gross revenues from Retail Partners, as the number of retail partners increase over time, will far exceed Matthews\u2019 retail store sales potential, resulting in greater long-term revenue stability and profitability., 51929=According to marketresearch.com, consumer packaged goods in the lawn and garden sector are estimated to grow at roughly 3.5-4% each year through 2014. Growth will be led by fertilizers and growing media posting above average gains., 556125=The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has suffered losses in the two most recent fiscal years, has negative working capital, and generated a negative internal cash flow from operations in 2011 and 2010 that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management\u2019s plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 13. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty., 324456=As of March 31, 2012, there were 61,215,081 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, which were held of record by approximately 602 share holders., 483398=(1) The Company has a line of credit with Bank of Granite at an interest rate of prime plus 3 % per annum. The balance on this credit line was $2,377 as of December 31, 2011. Accordingly, the Company recorded interest expenses of $1,682 and $2,510 during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively., 217664=More specifically, the Company has noted a contraction in its revenues from the peak in 2008 through 2009, 2010 and 2011. Part of this contraction is due to the economic climate, while another part is likely due to the company\u2019s inability to replace lost customers from normal attrition. This contraction is what precipitated our change of business model in mid 2009, to a manufacturer/distributor model, over the previous traditional retail model. However, there is no assurance that this reduced dependence will result in adequate sales revenue to sustain our business. This reasoning goes back to our inability to afford an adequate number of experienced sales and support staff. It should be noted, however, that even with an adequate number of experienced sales and support staff, there is no assurance that sales revenues will increase, or that the number of lost customers through attrition will be reduced., 64716=The green economy is in its infancy. According to marketresearch.com, as it relates to organic based fertilizers and soil conditioners, these types of products in the consumer packaged lawn and garden sector are expected to continue to grow at more than twice the rate of traditional fertilizer sales through 2014., 954670=Property and equipment was comprised of the following as of December 31, 2011 and 2010:, 72314=As a small company we are able to respond to market forces and trends more quickly than larger manufacturers. This allows the company to take advantage of certain opportunities afforded when industry and market trends reveal themselves. For example, when we learned that incorporating sources of organic matter held multiple benefits for a variety of growing environments, we chose to incorporate sources of organic matter into our products for use in lawns, gardens and ornamental beds, and have done so since 2007. Organic matter has many benefits for the soil, which include increasing microbial activity, diversity in the soil food web, and helping to ease compaction, as well as improving water and nutrient, holding capacity. The combined effects from using organic matter help the homeowner or commercial business reduce the amount of supplemental irrigation needed, thus saving them money on their water bill., 942847=Bad debt expenses of $2,720 and $122 were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated income statements., 170352=There is no backlog of unshipped orders for all of our products as of December 31, 2011. We are currently able to produce all of the fertilizer and soil conditioners needed to supply our customers from our facility in Charlotte. However, as we begin expanding our sales force, we believe the demand will quickly outpace capacity for production at this facility. As a result, we are planning to move to a larger production facility in order to meet anticipated demand for 2012-2015.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "\u00a0 We have plans to develop new products over the next few years targeted to specific segments of the residential, commercial and Ag/Farmer fertilizer markets. 1) Liquid & Granular organic based fertilizers for use inside and outside of the home. These products will primarily be smaller in size and weight and are targeted for Internet Ecommerce and on-shelf, retail partner sales. 2) A line of granular and liquid fertilizers targeted to the commercial landscaper and agriculture segments. These products will be developed using key macro and micronutrients specific to the industry and will be sold at lower price points to be competitive in those segments. Management believes commercial and Ag/Farmer use of organic based fertilizers will increase, based on the previously discussed consumer demand. We have already observed instances in the southeast, where residential consumers have demanded that their landscape service providers use organic based and natural products on their landscapes, or risk losing the contract. We have also been told by customers that engage in the development of real estate projects that their some of their customers have demanded a switch to more environmentally responsible landscape care products. \u00a0",
    "textAfterTable": "\u00a0 Although management plans to continue research and development on these product categories, there is no assurance that any actual products will be developed for the noted categories. And if there are products developed, there is no assurance that they will be in any great demand. \u00a0 Increasing production capacity \u00a0 Our current production equipment and components are adequate to meet current demand and limited future demand. However, to meet the demand anticipated later in 2012 and beyond, based on the planned expansion of our sales efforts, we will need to move to a larger production and warehouse facility, or take advantage of outsourcing some or all of our manufacturing to ensure that we can consistently meet the demand of our customers.
