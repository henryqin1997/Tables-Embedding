    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{33725=For a while Asus has been trying to break into the business market with the AsusPro laptops. The new 14-inch P45VJ-VO002X has to face up to our tests. We already reviewed the P43SJ predecessor in 2011. Asus equip the small laptop with a Core i5-3210M CPU and a GeForce GT 635M GPU., 10265=Contrast (242:1)\u00a0and black value (0.86 cd/m\u00b2) of the display also do not convince and are poor. Again the\u00a0Vostro 3460 (159:1, 0.97 cd/m\u00b2) and the\u00a0TravelMate P643 (138:1, 1.32 cd/m\u00b2) perform worse. None of the three displays is able to display deep black. Furthermore, the Chi Mei display can neither cover AdobeRGB nor sRGB.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{241054=The\u00a0WLAN test ends after\u00a04:43 h - a decent result. The Dell only achieves 3:52 h. Here the TravelMate runs longest with 6:05 h. In this test, web sites are automatically loaded in 40-second intervals. The energy saving profile is active and the display brightness set to about 150 cd/m\u00b2. DVD playback\u00a0\u00a0stops after\u00a04:36 h. Again the Asus performs better than the 3460 (3:22 h) and worse than the P643 (4:58 h). The DVD test is run with active energy saving \u00a0profile (or higher, if the DVD does not play smoothly), maximum display brightness and deactivated Wi-Fi modules., 240114=A single battery charge is sufficient to operate the P45VJ for\u00a08:21 h while idle. The\u00a0Vostro 3460 only achieves 5:44 h. With a runtime of 9:40 h the\u00a0TravelMate P643\u00a0outperforms both. The idle scenario is checked by means of the Battery Eater Reader's test with minimum brightness, active energy saving profile, and deactivated WiFi modules. In our\u00a0load scenario\u00a0the\u00a0Asus computer runs for 1:34 h compared to the battery runtimes of the Vostro (1:15 h) and the TravelMate (2:03 h). In our load scenario the Battery Eater Classic test is executed with maximum display brightness, high performance profile and activated Wi-Fi modules.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Asus equip the small notebook with a powerful graphics card. Although it is not designed for gamers, it is able to run current 3D games in medium and often also in high quality settings in native resolution (1366x768 pixels). However, because of the small display this will likely not be much fun. Connecting an external screen or TV is recommended.

    "textAfterTable": "Emissions System Noise Despite powerful components the P45VJ works rather quietly overall. While\u00a0idle\u00a0we measure a noise level of\u00a030 to 31.9 dB. The fan is often deactivated and only the hard drive is audible. Neither the\u00a0Vostro (36.6 - 39.9 dB) nor the\u00a0TravelMate (32.4 - 32.4 dB) can \u00a0keep up with these decent values. If the DVD drive is used the noise increases to 35.6 dB. With 39 dB in each load scenario,\u00a0the P45VJ neither gets too loud during\u00a0our stress test (Prime95 and Furmark) nor under medium load (3D Mark 06). The Vostro (46 and 45.4 dB) and the TravelMate (43.5 and 43.4 dB) are outperformed again. Noise Level Idle 30 / 30.9 / 31.9 dB(A)",
