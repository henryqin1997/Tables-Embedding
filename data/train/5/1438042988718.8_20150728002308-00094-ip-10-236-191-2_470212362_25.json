The sample was then activated with 2000 ppm of sodium chlorite at a pH of 4.7. The sample was sent to a commercial skin testing laboratory to evaluate for skin irritation. The testing was accomplished using methods known to those of skill in the art. The sample exhibited a skin irritation reading of 0.5 after 15 minutes of contact. As is known in the art, a rating of <1.0 is deemed acceptable., 108675=The data illustrates that at ratios of chlorite to iodide ion above about 2, appreciable amounts of chlorine dioxide are generated very rapidly, i.e. within less than about 5 minutes of mixing providing that the ratio of chlorite to iodide ion is greater than 2. Note in particular examples 1-6 and 7-11. At ratios of less than about 2:1, either no reactions occurred as illustrated by comparative examples A and B, iodide was converted to iodine as exhibited by the gold-violet colors, or to iodate as exhibited by the colorless solutions (comparative examples C to G). There was no evidence of chlorine dioxide, however, for any of these comparative examples., 63281=The chlorine dioxide precursor employed in the present invention is preferably a chlorite compound, and may be any metal chlorite, as well as mixtures thereof. The chlorite is preferably a salt of an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, a transition metal, or a mixture thereof. Examples of useful chlorites include sodium chlorite and potassium chlorite which are of the alkali metal class, and barium chlorite, calcium chlorite and magnesium chlorite which are of the alkaline earth metal class. Potassium chlorite and sodium chlorite, especially a dry technical grade sodium chlorite (typically contains about 80% by weight sodium chlorite and 20% by weight sodium chloride) are two of the preferred solid metal chlorites for use herein in powder, solid, or non-aqueous compositions. Liquid concentrate compositions using 2-part preparations preferably contain aqueous solutions of these metal chlorites in concentrations of about 0.01-75 wt %., 221139=The base teat dip composition, Table 15, was activated using different concentrations of sodium chlorite solution to initiate the reaction. The solutions were observed for chlorine dioxide formation. Table 16 illustrates these compositions and the data shown confirms the chlorite-to-iodide ratio requirement of greater than about 2:1 for effective chlorine dioxide generation in an antimicrobial product. The solutions were also tested for microbial efficacy against E. coli (ATCC 11229) using an organic soil challenge of 10% sterile milk (2% milk fat). The results showed log reductions of >6.9 for 15 seconds contact time and >6.9 for 30 seconds contact time., 65784=The addition of chlorite to the iodo-compound, when the ratio of chlorite to iodine atoms is 2 or more, proceeds through a reaction in which, iodine, I2, is first produced as noted by the yellowish-brown, brown, violet or mahogany color (solvent dependent color variations) produced in the solution. This color will vary depending on the concentration of the starting compounds, and the concentration of the iodine in the final solution. Of course, the more iodine, the darker the solution will be, with iodine odor being detectable during this phase of the reaction. Spectroscopic evidence of iodine and/or polyiodide species (I2, I3 \u2212 , I5 \u2212 , etc.,) are verified in the ultraviolet-visible spectra. Subsequently, the solution then goes colorless-yellow followed by a yellowish-green color which is indicative of chlorine dioxide. Simultaneously, the distinct odor of chlorine dioxide is also noted with the yellowish-green color formation, and the ultraviolet-visible spectra contrast its ultimate formation versus the iodine intermediate. If the ratio of chlorite to iodine atoms is less than 2, only iodine is generated to any significant degree. The solution will remain a yellow-brown-violet color, and the ultraviolet-visible spectrum will indicate only the formation of iodine. For example, at a ratio of 2.5:1.0 chlorite to iodide, iodine quickly forms as evidenced by a darker yellow-brown color in aqueous solution. The color quickly fades to clear and then the solution is ultimately converted to a yellowish-green color which is indicative of the presence of chlorine dioxide., 168277=Examples 24-28 shown in Table 7 demonstrate the relative rate of reaction for the iodide-induced chlorine dioxide reaction in a commercial teat dip. Thus, the iodide (400 ppm) containing teat dip shown Table 6 was activated with sodium chlorite (1000 ppm). The relative rate of chlorine dioxide generation in the teat dip was measured over time using UV-visible spectroscopy., 44095=Typically, however, the generation of chlorine dioxide has been accomplished either in the laboratory or at industrial levels at low pH values of 3 or less. Compositions that have a low pH are a problem for application to the skin of humans or animals such as teat dips because such acidity can cause skin irritation and burning. Additionally, acidic compositions can be corrosive to materials used in industrial equipment including metals, elastomers, plastics, cements and concretes, wovens, and so forth. Problems due to corrosion of equipment can obviously have a negative economical impact when chlorine dioxide is used as a sanitizer for industrial equipment. Raising the pH to levels at which there is no skin irritation results in compositions that generate chlorine dioxide at an undesirably slow rate, or favors secondary reaction routes which simultaneously produce other more undesirable chlorine species (e.g., chlorates, chlorides, chlorine gas, and so forth). For example, an equimolar mixture of potassium chlorate and hydrochloric acid yields chlorine dioxide to chlorine gas at a ratio of about 1.0:1.35., 64250=Preferably, the chlorine dioxide precursor components useful in the present invention are those which form or produce chlorine dioxide in a liquid medium in response to a an activator or promoter component. Typically, it is desirable to generate from about 0.1 ppm to about 5000 ppm of chlorine dioxide, preferably from about 1 to about 250 ppm, and most preferably from about 3 to about 150 ppm chlorine dioxide. Consequently, the amount of chlorite utilized is typically from about 0.5 to about 5000 ppm, and more preferably from about 10 to about 2500 ppm., 52698=The term disinfectant refers to an agent that kills all vegetative cells including most recognized pathogenic microorganisms. As such, it must pass a more stringent bactericidal test; the A.O.A.C. Use Dilution Methods, Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists, paragraph 955.14 and applicable sections, 15th Edition, 1990 (EPA Guideline 91-2). High level disinfectants include reductions in viruses, mycobacteria and other resistant pathogenic organisms., 233176=A barrier teat dip composition was prepared and tested for microbial efficacy. The composition is found in the following Table 17. Barrier compositions are typically characterized as being aseptic, high viscosity, surface protecting products. The formula, containing 400 ppm potassium iodide, was actived with 1000 ppm sodium chlorite. The chlorine dioxide yield results of the testing are found in Table 18. The relative rate of kill of E. Coli, based on the ATC method 11229, was found to yield complete (5 log) kill at each of the reaction times after mixing., 56871=where ClO2 \u2212is a negatively charged chlorite ion X (is a/are) cation(s), I\u2212is an iodide anion, I2 is molecular iodine, IO3 \u2212is an iodate ion, and ClO2 is chlorine dioxide (solvated or gaseous). While it is not the intent of this patent to conclusively identify the exact reaction mechanism, it is reasonable to suggest that the chlorite salt acts as an oxidant to convert, in situ, the iodide salt into labile iodine which, subsequently, is converted to iodate as the chlorine dioxide is formed. This mechanism is consistent with the generalization literature reaction between chlorite ions and halogens; as outlined in Furman, C. S. and Margerum, D. W.; Inorg. Chem., 1998, Vol. 37, pp. 4321-4327 and references therein. It is surmised that the following balanced equation may be representative of the ultimate reaction responsible for the generation of chlorine dioxide from sodium chlorite and an inorganic iodide salt:, 53211=A sanitizer is an agent that reduces the number of bacterial contaminants to safe levels as judged by public health requirements. Practically, a sanitizer must result in a 99.999% reduction (5 log order reduction) for given organisms as defined by Germicidal and Detergent Sanitizing Action of Disinfectants, Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists, paragraph 960.09 and applicable sections, 15th Edition, 1990 (EPA Guideline 91-2). In common practice, substances that are applied to food contact surfaces for antimicrobial purposes must meet this requirement., 61833=The term \u201ciodophor\u201d is used herein to refer generally to those compounds which are complexes of iodine, or may refer to any carrier of iodine, the only requirement being that the compounds have at least one iodine atom in their structure. lodophors are typically formed with organic polymers or surfactants to improve the solubility of iodine in aqueous solution. These organic polymers include a broad range of molecular weights and chain lengths, and may be either ionic or non-ionic in character, and may possess either surfactant or non-surfactant properties. Polyvinylpyrrolidone and detergent polymers are known to increase the aqueous solubility of iodine and are perhaps the more commonly used polymers for iodophor formation. Polyvinylpyrrolidone is a non-detergent, non-ionic, non-surface active polymer. Detergent polymers, on the other hand, are nonionic, anionic and cationic, and are surface active. Iodophors are discussed in \u201cProceedings of the 2nd International Symposium on Povidone\u201d Univ. of Kentucky, Apr. 12-15, 1987; Lexington, Ky.; and patents U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,916,581, 5,885,620, 5,720,984, 5,716,611, 5,534,266, and 4,575,491 herein incorporated by reference. The iodo-compounds or activator component is useful in an amount effective to induce formation of chlorine dioxide in an amount effective for the composition to act as an antiseptic, disinfectant, deodorant, sanitizer, and so forth., 42951=As a consequence, the common practice has evolved to generating chlorine dioxide right at the site where it is being used. Such generation methods are outlined in Chlorine Dioxide, Chemistry and Environmental Impact of Oxychlorine Compounds; Masschelein, W. J., Ann Arbor Science Inc., 1979, and typically employ the use of chlorine dioxide generating or liberating compounds such as chloric acid, chlorites and chlorates in applications in which chlorine dioxide is being used as a disinfectant, sterilizer, deodorizer, sanitizer, antiseptic, fungicide, germicide, and so forth., 104250=The compositions of the present invention find particular utility in the cleaning/santizing of dairy processing equipment. Such equipment is commonly manufactured from glass or stainless steel, and is used in both dairy farm installations and in dairy plant installations for the processing of milk, cheese, ice cream or other dairy products. Use concentrations capable of generating from about 1 to 1000 ppm chlorine dioxide are preferred, with concentrations of about 5 to 300 being most preferred.}",
