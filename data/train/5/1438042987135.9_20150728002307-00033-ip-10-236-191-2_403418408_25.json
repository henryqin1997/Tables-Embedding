When the settlers came to Canada, they encountered new things for which they had no names, and were therefore forced to create names. But, although they were forced to create new words to express themselves, the grammatical structures they needed to express themselves were already firmly established. The changes that have taken place in the grammar system are, most likely, changes that are due to the natural evolution of a language., 33444=In general, the grammar system of CF remains quite similar to that of FF. The reason for this is the same as that given for CE, i.e., the grammar of a language is very stable and is altered only very gradually and slightly., 26201=Similarly, there are not many differences between the grammar of CF and the grammar of the French from France (FF). Furthermore, it would appear that most of the differences that do exist are more likely to occur in the spoken language than the written language., 33989=As with grammar, there are no spelling practices which are specifically Canadian. Here once again we see that Canadians are influenced by both AE and BE, and consequently, what constitutes the \"Canadianness\" of spelling in CE is its divided usage between AE and BE practices.(5) The example which best illustrates this divided usage is the term \"tire centre\", which uses the American spelling of \"tire\" and the British spelling of \"centre\". (Bailey 1991:20), 46921=In CE, usage in this case is very much divided. Maclean's uses the AE -or (Peters and Fee 1989:142), and according to Chambers (1986:6), this spelling has been the common practice of newspapers in Canada since 1887. Conversely, the BE -our spelling is more often used in academic and professional journals. (Pringle 1985:189), 61576=Canadian scholars have repeatedly remarked on the homogeneity of CE pronunciation. Chambers (1986:12) notes that \"Probably no other country has a standard accent that is so geographically widespread and so socially ubiquitous.\" Nevertheless, there are features which distinguish our speech from other varieties. These features may be distinctly Canadian, but here again, as in grammar and orthography, the primary source of these variations is the competing influence of Britain and the United States., 20846=Analysis of the ECP corpus confirms the results of the 1970 surveys. The usage of \"dived\"/\"dove\" is still split almost 50-50 amongst Canadians, as can be seen in the following table., 69495=In every aspect of language, i.e., the lexicon, the grammar, the orthography and the phonology, there are features which distinguish CE and CF from the English and French varieties spoken in other parts of the world. In some cases, what distinguishes the Canadian variety may be the presence of a feature which is distinctly Canadian; in others, it may be the fact that Canadian usage consists of a mixture of features from other varieties of the language. Both are instances of Canadian usage, for, as Avis's definition of the term \"Canadianism\" states, a Canadianism need not necessarily be native or exclusive to Canada, but rather distinctively characteristic of Canadian usage., 70458=3. The surveys being referred to are the Survey of Canadian English by Scargill and Warkentyne in 1972 and a regional survey of usage in Toronto by Chambers in 1979.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "In BE, there is a tendency to drop the definite article with certain institutions, such as \"hospital\". In BE, one would say \"he went to hospital\" or \"he is in hospital\" whereas in AE, one would say \"to the hospital\" and \"in the hospital\". The tendency to drop the article, which appears to be a growing tendency in Britain, may, according to McConnell (1979:35), be spreading to North America. Corpus analysis confirms that this phenomenon is indeed widespread in BE and CE, but not in AE as yet. 2.2.1.1 USE OF DEFINITE ARTICLE The following few points, which were raised by McConnell in Our Own Voice (1979), will be checked against the textual database of the Bilingual Canadian Dictionary Project to see whether current usage supports or disproves them. For the English-language corpora, the Canadian corpus used will be the English Canadian Press (ECP), the American will be the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), and the British will be British corpus collections, (BRCOR), which incorporate a number of scholarly and journalistic texts. For the French-language corpora, the Canadian corpus used will be the Presse canadienne fran\u00e7aise (PCF) and the French corpus will be Le Monde (MOND). Given that the size of these five corpora vary greatly, we will not compare the total number of occurrences in each, but rather the percentage of occurrences of each practice. Generally speaking, in English there are no grammatical features",

Results from the BCD's corpus indicate that this is certainly still the case amongst the British and the American speakers, as there are no occurrences of \"barber shop\" in BRCOR, nor are there any of \"barber's shop\" in WSJ. The Canadian corpus, ECP, reveals an overwhelming, yet not complete, preference for the American practice in this respect. A possible explanation for this phenomenon may be a desire on the part of the New World settlers to simplify their language. \"Barber shop\" is certainly easier to pronounce and is clearer sounding than \"barber's shop\".
