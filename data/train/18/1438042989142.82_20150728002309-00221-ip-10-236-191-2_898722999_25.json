            "Campus safety patrols 24/7. Anytime a student feels unsafe they are able to call campus safety and they will be right there. Located throughout campus they are safety stations with buttons that allow any student to press a button if feeling unsafe.",

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{62438=Wingate University is a small, private school in North Carolina around 45 minutes outside of downtown Charlotte. The school has around 1800 undergraduate students and many of those are athletes. If you do not play a sport at Wingate you are left with one of three options, join greek life, transfer, or stay and be miserable., 151049=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 13808=It was the perfect fit for me. The student to teacher ratio is 14:1 and the campus is small, around 1,800 students (2,300 including graduates), so you get to know people on campus, but it's not so small where you feel as though you see the same people all the time. Not a big party school, but was fun to apartment-hop on the weekends and hang out with a lot of different people., 116882=The cafeteria is being renovated for the fall of 2013 so the facilities will be much nicer! The food has been improving since I've been here and is showing signs of improving in the future! We have the cafeteria, the Klondike Poolside, we are getting an Einstein's Bagels in the fall, and we're also getting a new dining option in the Spring of 2014 that is supposed to be kind of like a ruby tuesday., 5136=The price to attend is pretty much ridiculous considering the facilities AND considering there are no 24 hr buildings or food places. The school has been around since 1896 and I feel that it shows. Changes and upgrades are being made but maybe the most important ones are not. There are some good teachers at Wingate; some who have been there for years and years. This is my second year and one of my teachers, who is also my advisor, has helped me out a lot. Not only did he help me with my school but had a listening ear when I needed someone to talk to., 20629=Wingate University is a private university in Wingate, North Carolina home of the bulldogs. Wingate University was founded in 1896. It has more than 2,500 students., 117570=The dorms are like any other college campus. Wingate is renovating it's old All freshman male dorm into a beautiful new residence hall, complete with a new pool and courtyard. There is also a brand new residence hall that was completed for the Spring semester of 2013. It's mostly for freshman accommodations.}",

    "textAfterTable": "I don't really know how to talk about this section because different teachers/professors teach differently while we as students, learn differently. There are some really good teachers at school. Some of the ones I've had have been there for 10+ years.. One teacher I have tends to trail off, get long-winded or lose track of time so I feel like they talk so much we don't get much done. All teachers have their office hours which, in my experiences, they are happy to help you. Keep your appointments if you should make any with your teachers/advisor though. That's important.

Wingate is also in between cities and rural so students who want a little bit of both would enjoy Wingate. Bang for the buck",
