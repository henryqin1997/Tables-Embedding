            "Very safe campus. The security guards are sometimes considered annoying in regards to the amount of attention and dedication they give to student safety. ID's are required everywhere on campus!",
            "Not interested in Greek Life but from the looks of it they have a lot of fun and are really united.",
            "Plenty of clubs to join and activities to participate in. You can even start you own Clubs and activities, all you need in participants and approval.",
            "I would say it is worth the money but do suggest they lower the price because there are many issues that student face and they shouldn't for the amount we pay.",
            "A few parties around the city, shopping, ice skating in the winter and other endless fun opportunities are available.",
            "Overall the food is good although I wish they would change up the menu every month.",
            "The St.George residence hall is amazing. The rooms vary in size, the lounge and study area is very helpful for students. The view of the city and the Brooklyn bridge walk is really beneficial.",
            "Great Academic Rigor.",
            "Make sure you research all you need to know about Pace University before accepting admissions because Pace is not for everyone. I would rather you come into the experience happy and graduate with the same attitude.",
            "Pace University is an amazing school that has so much to offer to their students. The staff are as helpful as possible, understanding and knowledge about their subjects and the University. Pace is a safe school that will provide you with the knowledge and skills you need to become successful."

Whether it be a club event inside school or the thrill of city life outside of Pace's doors, you will never be bored. The university provides a friendly, welcoming environment that is definitely carried on in the classroom as well. Am learning a lot I am a freshman at Pace and I feel that I have definitely learned a lot. Though I have been at Pace University for one semester so far, I am doing excellently, holding a GPA of 3.8. The teachers are extremely friendly and helpful and are very knowledgeable of their material.
