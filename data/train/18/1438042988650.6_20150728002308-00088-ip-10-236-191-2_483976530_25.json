Jarrah, Gang Yu, Nirup Krishnamurthy, and Anada Rakshit, Transportation Science, vol. 27, No.3, August, pp 266-280, Operations Research Society of America (1993), proposes two separate models for re-routing aircraft in response to irregular operations. One model is provided to manage flight delays, and the other contemplates only flight cancellations. The models are presented as minimum cost network flow problems that can be solved readily. However, no integrated cancellation and delay process is presented. In contrast, the present invention addresses both cancellations and delays as it generates solutions, and handles all user requirements and operations constraints within a unified framework. Further, the current invention is not related to minimum cost network flow solution techniques., 51889=In \u201cBalancing User Preferences for Aircraft Schedule Recovery During Airline Irregular Operations\u201d, by Benjamin G. Thengvall, Jonathan F. Bard, and Gang Yu, submitted for publication (March, 1998), the authors present a time-space network for modeling the irregular operations re-routing of aircraft. The resulting model handles delays and cancellations simultaneously, and attempts to limit the disruptions to the original aircraft routings. This model is a network flow with side constraints, and it is solved with traditional network flow and integer programming algorithms. Once the problem is modeled, the corresponding mathematical program is solved with commercial, general purpose network and integer program solvers. In contrast, the invention under consideration within the Aircraft Optimization Engine solves the problem at hand differently. It employs a process that generates solutions through the execution of operations on the grounded aircraft routes. It also solves the problem more robustly because it does not limit flight delays to specific time intervals as in the above paper. Additionally, the current invention is more successful at limiting the number of disrupted routings due to the design of the operations. Furthermore, the operations can be executed much more quickly to generate solutions than the methods required to solve network flow models., 42732=Prior publications of general interest as background information include the following: \u201cModel To Reduce Airline Schedule Disturbances\u201d, by Dusan Teodorovic and Goran Stojkovic, Journal of Transportation Engineering, July/August (1995); \u201cSwapping Applications In A Daily Airline Fleet Assignment\u201d, by Kalyan T.

Arguello, Jonathan F. Bard, and Gang Yu, submitted for publication (March, 1997), introduces a time-band model for re-routing aircraft in response to irregular operations. The model approximates the operational problem, integrates the handling of delays and cancellations, and is readily solvable. Further, the model is a minimum cost network flow with side constraints, and is solved through use of traditional network flow algorithms that are commercially available in general purpose network and integer program solvers. However, there is no constraint to affect a minimum number of flight routes, and no ability to meet real-time requirements.}",

After logic step 105, proceed directly to logic step 109, skipping logic steps 106, 107, and 108. Additionally, after logic step 113, logic path 114 is skipped and the logic flow process proceeds directly to logic step 126, where it is determined if more cancellation sequences exist in G. If so, logic step 127 is skipped and the logic flow process continues to logic step 109. If not, then the logic flow process skips logic steps 130 and 135, and continues to logic step 136. In general, these modifications avoid the Swap and its combination operations which are performed in the Binary Operations, and need not be repeated in the Reverse Binary Operations. The Reverse Binary Operations can be entered immediately after logic step 44 in FIG. 3. After logic step 44, the Grounded Aircraft Route and the Available Aircraft Routes are respectively re-labeled as Available Aircraft Route and Grounded Aircraft Routes. The Reverse Binary Operations then are entered. Upon completion of the Reverse Binary Operations, the Grounded Aircraft Routes and the Available Aircraft Route are re-labeled so that the Available Aircraft Route becomes the Grounded Aircraft Route, and the Grounded Aircraft Routes become Available Aircraft Routes according to their original labels. Thereafter, the Three-Way Operation is entered at logic step 45. Recall that for the",
