The oldest hall (Porter) was just renovated, the newest hall, Rountree, just opened in Fall 2012 and is really nice, and there's another hall being built that should be done by fall 2013. All the halls are pretty much on the same side of campus (except for a few, especially Rountree), so it's a nice separation of academic life and dorm life. The dorms have a lot of activities, including a weekly Friday Night Club. There are also a lot of options. There are several traditional halls, where you share a room with one person and a bathroom with your wing. There are also apartment-style dorms (Southwest Hall) where each suite has four single bedrooms, a living room, a dining area with kitchenette, and two bathrooms. There's also suite-style, where you share a bedroom with one other person, and each suite of two shares a bathroom, fridge, and microwave with another suite of two., 12610=I love the campus atmosphere, being from a graduating class of 32, platteville is the perfect size. I guess one thing that the guys like, the guy to girl ratio is 2:3, keeping them happy! It's not too city like, it has the town and necessities, but it's also very country...we have the largest M to climb!, 16505=Many of the classes are incredibly simple. The higher level classes are much better, but anything 2000 and bellow, you are treated as if you are a freshman in high school. It's really frustrating to be taught an education that is greatly toned down and edited. The number of required survey classes for general education just makes this experience extended for all four years..., 169003=Incredible value. You rent textbooks instead of buying them for a ridiculous price. No tuition increase from 2012-2013., 230697=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Reviewer has been to campus. 4 out of 4 people found this review useful. 3 of 49 Categories Comments Campus Safety On every light post there is a blue glowing button for safety and to press of you are in danger. Authorities will be there within minutes. There are cameras for safety as well. Greek Life As an incoming freshman I have already received many invites to Greek living. They take it serious yet fun. The Greek life at Platteville is actually pretty large. Clubs and Activities Platteville has over 200 clubs and activities that you can join and you can find them all at their website under pioneer link. Great for these types of students Outgoing yet enjoys a little peace and isn't a huge",
