With only 4 EUs (Execution Units) and a relatively low clock speed of up to 778 MHz, the GPU is even slower than the\u00a0HD Graphics (Ivy Bridge). Therefore, only older and less demanding Windows games like World of Warcraft or Fifa will run fluently. However, video acceleration and display resolutions up to 2560 x 1600 pixels are no problem for the chip.}",
