Support in a specific 12.2SX release of this train depends on your feature set, platform, and platform hardware. Usage Guidelines Specifying authentication for an area sets the authentication to Type 1 (simple password) as specified in RFC 1247. If this command is not included in the configuration file, authentication of Type 0 (no authentication) is assumed. The authentication type must be the same for all routers and access servers in an area. The authentication password for all OSPF routers on a network must be the same if they are to communicate with each other via OSPF. Use the ip ospf authentication-key interface command to specify this password. If you enable MD5 authentication with the message-digest keyword, you must configure a password with the ip ospf message-digest-key interface command.
