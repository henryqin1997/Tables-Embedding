Don't let this scare you. The professors usually have students do either one research paper, a group paper, mini journal entries, or a presentation to meet this requirement. But in the end you do become more confident in your writings., 121357=Every Tuesday and Thursday during U-Hour a bunch of clubs promote themselves and it's just a great time. There are some live bands, tons of free food, and a lot of people to go out and meet and share a good time with. Also near October we have a mascarade ball which really fun to go to., 103551=I visited the campus late 2011. The campus was very clean. Expect to run up and down stairs all day as the campus is a bit Hilly, 51417=many campuses have large food courts but as of right now we have one option by the university. in the spring of 2013 the student union will be opening and that will have many food options. i believe subway and a few other fast food places will be in there. but even though we only have the big cat food court food right now the food is really good., 147649=Dorm life at CSUSM is great. The dorms, built less than ten years ago, are spacy and very clean. The Quad is the new dorm building and, so far, it looks great! It's being finished in August and although it is expensive to live there, there are many other opportunities to live off campus with other students., 35866=Every Tuesday and Thursdays from noon to 1:00 p.m. in front of Kellogg Library, there is University Hour (U-hour.) This gives students a break from school to socialize with their fellow peers. Often times there will be some sort of fair and occasionally free food is given out., 201282=We do have No-Shave November in which men do not shave (women are included as well) and another fun tradition is the Zombies Vs. Humans game played on campus in the evenings during the week nearing Halloween., 273847=You Must complete a 2500 word essay, per class., 161760=Food is alright, but the new student center will have better food for 2014, 22047=I have been attending San Marcos since my freshman year Fall 2009. All of my classes have been very informative and interesting, and all of the professors take the time to get to know students. The classes are smaller but in my opinion that is a good thing because it gives the professors a chance to know the students which I think helps students learn. Professors usually are always available during their office hours if you need any extra help and the campus has several outlets for extra help in classes as well., 357330=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 287862=Every year in the month of May the annual CSUSM Undie Run takes place, is a community service event where students shed their clothes into proper donation bins, and then run around campus. The donations are donated to various women and domestic violence shelters, Goodwills, Salvation Army, etc., 52049=my first year i lived on campus. technically they are not dorms they are apartments. when i lived on campus i was living with 5 other girls and at times it was a little rough but in the end i really enjoyed the experience. i know they are making more apartment/dorms that should be opening in the fall of 2012.}",

    "textAfterTable": "I'm a commuter, which means I go back and forth from home to school everyday. For me, this school is working out great. It's close to home, I feel safe on campus and I hear the living environment is great in San Marcos, should you choose to live near or on campus. It's a clean, fun, college campus where you can either branch out and meet other great students or just attend for the learning aspect. I would consider this one of the nicest college campuses I've been on. Am learning a lot I have attended Cal State San Marcos since Fall of last year. The greatest thing, in regards to the learning environment at Cal State San Marcos, is that students get to feel like a student and not just another number. The classes are rather small- medium size, about high school size, depending on where you went to high school, which allows students, should they choose, to develop great relationships with their professors. I got to personally know each one of the the professors I've had thus far and it's been such a great experience. They have taught me so much more and I'm getting 10x more out of it then I got from high school. Login to rate or flag the reviews",
