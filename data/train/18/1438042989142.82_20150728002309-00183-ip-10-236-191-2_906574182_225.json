            "There are always problems or incidents, especially since this is a metropolitan area, but the safety is the number one priority. There is a police department on campus, and I always see them driving around in the police cars, or on the golf carts. There is a MoBull alert system, which texts students who are signed up. There are also e-mail alerts for the same reasons. There is a severe weather alert system--sirens and on the televisions--for when a tornado is approaching. There are emergency towers all over campus for emergency uses. At night, they have a safety escort team, for free, for students with night classes that go across campus. I know you can text a number if you are leaving and text them when you get to where you need to be, as well. My friend has a bad knee and wears a brace; we were walking across campus and a safe team officer picked us up so she wouldn't have to walk so far. Overall, I feel very safe here.",
            "The Greek Life is there, but it is not dominant. It is not like in the movies where it gets wild and crazy, as far as I know, but a group of people with alike interests.",
            "There are over 600 clubs to join, some of them very interesting -- medieval club, for example -- and of, course, there are some sororities and fraternities. There is always something going on, and the university is really great about making sure people know what is going on.",
            "Anyone who is interested in pursuing some sort of science, medical, or research.",
            "Some of the buildings have very unique architectural designs. There always seems to be something happening that is unusual, but fun at the same time. I see some people dressed up in Hawaiian clothes occasionally.",
            "The education is very good here, and I feel like Im learning a lot. Their programs are well respected in my field, but it seems as if high school students don't always hear about this school. The school is very clean, very safe, and very nice.",
            "USF students get into the Dali Museum in St. Petersburg for free. The beaches are only 30 minutes to an hour away--depending on which one you go to--and the Campus Recreational Center sometimes has a bus that shuttles students to the beaches. The Campus Recreational Center always has an event, from white-water rafting to the beach. Nearby, there are several malls, lots of shopping areas, parks, and there are always things to do on campus. Every Wednesday afternoon outside the Marshall Student Center, they have free things for the students.",
            "In a word, delicious! The people who serve the food are always very nice, and they start to recognize you after a while. While they may not have all my favorite foods every day, I never go hungry. They have fresh produce every day, including a salad bar, and they have some of my favorite foods. For example, their chicken sandwich is my absolute favorite. Although I'm not a vegetarian, or a vegan, they have accommodations for those with vegetarian and vegan diets. I'm lactose-intolerant, and, for the first time in six months, I was able to eat ice cream because of their lactose-free ice cream. I have to say, the food is really good here.",
            "Like all metropolitan areas, there is some crime here, but I don't feel unsafe. The rooms are clean and regularly cleaned by staff -- pending on which one you are in -- and are nice. The suite I am in is like a bunker, which is good when it's storming outside. There are some people who are giving us problems, but that happens everywhere. Overall, I am definitely planning to stay on campus again.",
            "Some of the general classes are not very hard, but I have done the International Baccalaureate Program, which means I'm mostly used to it. Some classes are challenging, but not all of them. It honestly depends on your major and your work ethics.",
            "Like all colleges, make sure you want to come here. The weather changes constantly, but is mostly very beautiful. Know what you want to get into, and don't be afraid to ask anyone if you have any questions.",
            "The campus is here is beautiful, with very friendly and polite faculty and staff. The educational programs here are very well known, especially their research programs. It as an amazing school, but not as widely known in Florida as other schools."

This along with federal aid will really diminish the need for loans!, 529412=Humans versus Zombies is a staple of the campus in October for Halloween. It's a week long, campus-wide, game of tag essentially. It happens once every semester and is one of the most fun events I've ever participated in/watched!, 750471=There's a really cool sundial type thing with a meteorite in the middle of it, and on the summer solstice at 1:12 pm the circle above casts a shadow perfectly onto the circle in the center., 1116083=Food in the Argos, Andros, and Juniper/Poplar areas have ok food. Their food changes all the time but has sections that are always constant like sandwiches and pizza. The Marshall student center has a subway, panda express, chick-fil-a, and an organic section. After spring break of 2013 a pollo tropical is going to be on campus., 532688=The classes are consistent with whatever level you sign up for (1000 to 4000). Even if the course material is difficult, the professors are VERY accessible, as well as are the free tutor services and learning centers., 579975=The bathrooms are all cleaned regularly, the Juniper-Poplar Hall was just built in 2009, and there are always constant get togethers and fun activities on each floor., 176636=Apply early and be persistent. USF has not traditionally turned applicants away but this has changed over the past few years. Not everyone gets accepted anymore. Entrance requirements like GPA and SAT are really important so take the time to earn a high GPA and study for the SAT. Also, the university offers millions of dollars in scholarships to new students but you have to apply for them several months before the school year starts. Start looking into scholarships as early as October of the year before because their deadlines are often in the spring and long before the school year begins. Make some friends who are already at the university since they can give you specific tips on who to go to if you have an issue during the application process. It's easy to get lost in a big state university system so be diligent and take everything seriously. You'll have plenty of fun once you're accepted.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Besides your core classes that apply directly to your major, students must meet \u201cGordon Rule\u201d requirements in order to graduate. These classes have broadened my horizon tremendously. I never would have taken Anthropology, World Regional Geography, or American Drama without having these requirements. By meeting these requirements I have learned so much, not only definitions and theories, but world events and innovative strategies. Even as a student interested in medicine, these classes have opened up so many new windows and areas of my major for me to explore such as Medicine in West Africa or Anthropological medicine. The professors are also more than willing to go above and beyond to help you learn and apply your learning, if you show interest.
