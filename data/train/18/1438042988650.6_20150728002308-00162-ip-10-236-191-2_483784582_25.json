First, an average particle diameter of the main-component material is about 0.5 \u03bcm or less after milling and before calcining. Second, an A/B site ratio in the main-component material is in the range of about 0.97 to 1.01 before calcining. Third, a calcination temperature is in the range of about 1000 to 1300\ufffd C., 32845=[0006] However, in the nonreducing dielectric ceramics disclosed in the above-described Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication Nos. 60-131708 and 63-126117, raw materials, i.e., calcium carbonate (CaCO3), strontium carbonate (SrCO3), titanium dioxide (TiO2) and zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) are calcined at the same time as manganese dioxide (MnO2), which is a secondary component, and silicon dioxide (SiO2), which is a mineralizer, so as to make a ceramic having a main component satisfying the formula (Ca1-xSrx)m(Zr1-yTiy)O3. As a consequence, the resulting calcined material powder has not only peaks characteristic of a perovskite crystal phase which is the primary crystal phase, but also peaks indicating crystal phases not of the perovskite crystal phase. When the dielectric ceramic is formed by sintering one of these calcined material powders in a reducing atmosphere, crystal phases not of the perovskite-structured primary crystal phase (i.e., different phases) remain in the resulting dielectric. When the thickness of an element is reduced to manufacture a miniaturized high-capacitance monolithic ceramic capacitor, the performance thereof in a high-temperature loading lifetime test is degraded since these different crystal phases have inferior thermal resistance., 31800=[0004] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication Nos. 60-131708, 63-126117, 5-9073, 5-217426, 10-330163 and 10-335169 disclose (Ca1-xSrx)m(Zr1-yTiy)O3-type dielectric ceramic materials as nonreducing dielectric ceramic materials which exhibit excellent dielectric characteristics and do not become semiconductive even when internal electrodes provided therefor are composed of an inexpensive base metal such as nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), etc., and baking is performed in a neutral or reducing atmosphere having low oxygen partial pressure., 40425=[0017] The nonreducing dielectric ceramic in accordance with the present invention exhibits a high specific resistance of 1013 \u03a9\ufffdcm or more and a low dielectric loss of 0.1% or less. The rate of change in electrostatic capacitance is within \u22121000 ppm/\ufffdC. The performance thereof in a high-temperature loading lifetime test and moisture-resistance loading test is highly reliable. Moreover, irregularities in the characteristics thereof are reduced since substances which evaporate during sintering are not contained therein., 177294=[0051] As apparent from Tables 5 and 6, the nonreducing dielectric ceramics Samples 21 to 56 exhibited high specific resistances of 1013 \u03a9\ufffdcm or more and low dielectric losses of 0.1% or less. The rate of the change in electrostatic capacitance relative to temperature did not exceed \u22121000 ppm/\ufffdC. and this value may be adjusted to a desired value by changing the composition. The average lifetime in a high-temperature loading lifetime test at 150\ufffd C. and 200 V was significantly long and was 300 hours or more. Defects did not occur in the moisture-resistance loading test at 121\ufffd C./air pressure 2/100 V even after 200 hours had passed., 327664=[0101] As is apparent from Tables 14 and 15, the nonreducing dielectric ceramics Samples 121, 122, 124, 125, 127, 129, 131 and 133 to 148 exhibited high specific resistances of 1013 \u03a9\ufffdcm or more and low dielectric losses of 0.1% or less. The rate of change in electrostatic capacitance relative to temperature was within \u22121000 ppm/\ufffdC. This rate can be adjusted to a desired value by changing the composition. The average lifetime in the high-temperature loading lifetime test at 150\ufffd C./200 V was significantly long, i.e., 200 hours or more. No defective pieces were found after 200 hours in the moisture-resistance loading test at 121\ufffd C./air pressure 2/100 V., 362268=[0129] The material powder is preferably calcined at a temperature in the range of about 1000 to 1300\ufffd C. When the calcination temperature is less than about 1000\ufffd C., solid phase reaction is inhibited and the perovskite crystal phase as the primary crystal phase is inhibited from being synthesized. Unreacted substances remain and cause the generation of crystal phases not of perovskite crystal phase. When the calcination temperature exceeds about 1300\ufffd C., an average particle diameter of the calcined material powder is excessively increased, inhibiting solid phase reaction during the sintering process and preventing the formation of the perovskite crystal phase as the primary crystal phase., 358108=[0124] As is apparent from the dielectric ceramics Samples 119, 120, 123, 126, 128, and 130 in Table 10, 12 and 14 and Sample 132 in Tables 11, 13 and 15, the following factors must be satisfied in addition to satisfying the above-described composition ranges of the main-component and complying with the types of the compound oxide, in order to prevent the intensity of the maximum phase of the different phase to the maximum peak of the perovskite crystal phase from exceeding about 5%.

[0130] It should be noted that although the thickness of the sintered dielectric ceramic layer is 10 \u03bcm in the Examples above, the thickness can be further decreased to 5 \u03bcm or less so as to form a smaller high-capacitance monolithic ceramic capacitor. In this case also, fluctuation in particle diameter is prevented and sinterability is improved because of the above-described compound oxide added to the material powder. The resulting capacitor exhibits highly-reliable performance in high-temperature loading test and moisture-resistance loading test and enjoys the same advantages as that according to the Examples.
