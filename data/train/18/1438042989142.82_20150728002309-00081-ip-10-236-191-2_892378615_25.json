            "There are telephones everywhere on campus ready to dial security, as well as sound alarms to show and tell people where you are. The security people there are very helpful.",
            "They have a lot of clubs from sports to sewing, and with downtown Coeur d'Alene so close by, it's easy to walk to. Downtown you can go out to eat, shop around, hike Tubb's Hill, enjoy the scenery, go swimming(or parasailing, paragliding, water skiing, etc. Lots of rentals!) or even just sit somewhere quiet and talk with friends.",
            "If you need help, ASK! Don't think the teachers will turn you away, everyone generally helps everyone - it's great!",
            "They are a friendly, organized, and helpful community college with teachers who actually strive to help you pass, instead of just relaying information."

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Dual-Enrolling students, students from North Idaho, students who enjoy outdoor activities or beautiful scenery, incoming freshman who are looking for an easy transition between high school and other Idaho schools Tips for prospective students Just make sure you go to your classes and keep an open mind. They don't tolerate attitudes. Also, if you're not from the North Idaho area, we can tell. A lot of people tend to be discriminatory towards people that don't live here, so just be wary of that. Also, don't let the winters get to you. The summers are so worth it! Bang for the buck It's great to earn college credits for such a low price, and while still in high school. Also, its in such a great location! The beach is literally just across the street from the campus, and downtown Coeur d' Alene is just a quick walk away. It's in a great spot for being so low-priced Am enjoying being here It's an awesome experience for me, as a high schooler, to be able to attend a college and get the feel for the college. It's an easy way to get some of the experience that I'll",
