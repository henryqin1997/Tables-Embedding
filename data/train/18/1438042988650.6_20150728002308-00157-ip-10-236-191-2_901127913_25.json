            "The sun valley mall is right across the street, and some good restaurants as well. Downtown concord and downtown pleasant hill are both right next door pretty much. Lots of stuff to do.",
            "See a counselor right away and organize your goals. Register for classes early. Parking is crazy, but the overflow lot never fills up completely. It's across the street, but just get there a few minutes early to have time to walk to class. It's better than dealing with the stress of the main lot, and much faster.",
            "A great school full of opportunities and influential people. Most of the faculty is knowledgable and friendly, although using ratemyprofessor.com is helpful for avoiding the disgruntled and complacent teachers. All in all a great place to find your stride if your an undergraduate, or continue your education and learn new things."

The students that attend DVC are very diverse and unique in their own way. The student store is great when you need something on the hurry and the student library is the ideal place to go when you need a quiet and resourceful place to study. Am learning a lot Diablo Valley College has a variety of great professors that know what they are teaching. If you are focusing on a certain subject, DVC has the professors that you are looking for.
