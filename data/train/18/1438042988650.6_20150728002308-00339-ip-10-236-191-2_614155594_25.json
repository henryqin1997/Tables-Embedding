    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{147462=The screen's brightness also does not fulfill the expectations that we place on a 1200 Euro multimedia laptop. An average of 217 cd/m2 should suffice for most routine situations, but better numbers would enhance the readability, particularly in bright surroundings., 147796=Despite the installed BD drive and the ability to render high-definition movies, Toshiba opted against a Full HD screen. The user has to be content with a WXGA++ screen with a resolution of 1600 x 900 pixels instead. However, the graphics card should be able to cope with this resolution., 154921=The Satellite P875 connects to the Internet via Intel's Centrino Wireless-N 2230 supporting the standard IEEE 802.11 b/g/n. The low-end model unfortunately only supports connections to the 2.4 GHz band. Only the Advanced-N models support the 5 GHz band. At least the user can take advantage of gross transfer rates of up to 300 MB/s owing to dual-stream technology. However, we could only record 72 MB/s in our test (could be due to our router). The range and stability make a good impression., 154123=The built-in webcam's quality is not unimportant for a multimedia device. It is one of the poor quality ones we have seen in such an expensive device. The 1.0 MP sensor features a maximum resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels and only provides moderately focused and slightly noisy pictures. The corresponding microphone is a bit muffled but does a good job with VoIP programs like Skype., 166328=Expensive entertainer. Powerful hardware, strong speakers and a built-in Blu-Ray drive - let the fun begin. Toshiba's new multimedia all-rounder has its strengths but is let down by the poor screen. Is the notebook still worth its price of 1200 Euro (~$1500)?, 164750=Toshiba's Satellite P870-30E belongs to the premium price bracket by virtue of its price. Yes it does offer a great package when it comes to hardware \u2013 a quad core i7-3610M processor, 8 GB of RAM, a Blu Ray drive and 878 GB (750 GB HDD + 128 GB SSD) of storage space. Nvidia\u2019s GeForce GT 630M is the GPU of choice. But having a 17.3-inch WXGA++ display in a laptop being sold for such a lot of money is disappointing. But buyers looking to get the device should pick up the machine without the SSD which should bring down the price to 1000 Euro (~$1250)., 160042=In addition to the usual VGA and HDMI sockets, we would have appreciated a DisplayPort for rendering movies from the integrated BD drive to monitors with more than 1920x1080 resolutions. Although HDMI would, in principle, be capable of higher resolutions, there are currently not many monitors that enable transmitting 1440p or 1600p via interfaces other than the DisplayPort (or dual-link DVI).}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{132482=If you are willing to invest 1200 Euro in a multimedia laptop, you will unlikely want to accept compromises. Our expectations on Toshiba's Satellite P875-30E were high and the lavishly equipped 17 inch behemoth could mostly fulfill them., 46145=The GT 630M is frequently too low in the performance stakes to render current games in maximum details and native resolution. A resolution of 1366x768 pixels is already too much for the graphics card in Battlefield 3 and Anno 2070 forcing the user to play the game with medium if not low settings. The GeForce GT 650M in the Samsung is almost twice as fast and the better choice for gamers. The Satellite P875 also lags behind the Asus N76NV again due to the omitted GPU Turbo which limits the performance significantly in this case., 16607=The GeForce GT 630M is an old acquaintance. The underlying GF108 chip has been installed in many multimedia laptops since 2010. Nvidia has now presented a refresh of the card scaled down to 28 nanometers (GF117 chip), but Toshiba still installs the older 40 nanometer version in its P875. Unfortunately, the manufacturer also omits the optional Turbo mode of the GeForce 600M generation and sets the core clock to 662 MHz (load). The 96 shader units clock at twice the frequency (1324 MHz) and the 2 GB DDR3 VRAM (128 bit) with 900 MHz in the Fermi card., 17315=The new GeForce GT 650M (Kepler) model in Samsung's 550P7C blows away the GT 630M. The Satellite also lags behind the N76VM with the same GPU due to the lack of Turbo. The advantage of Asus' notebook is roughly 15 percent (1288 to 1123 points) in 3DMark 11. The graphics card's extreme throttling on battery power is common to both devices (3DMark 11: 319 points).}",

    "textAfterTable": "Emissions System Noise The Satellite's fan ran constantly at idle due to the relatively high ambient temperatures during our test (approximately 25 degrees Celsius). The noise level of 32.5 dB (A) remained quite inconspicuous. However, the fan increased its speed occasionally even during light load reaching up to 34.8 dB (A) making the laptop clearly audible (from a normal seating distance). The noise level increased even more during load and reached levels of 39.1 dB (A) (3DMark 06) and 43.3 dB (A) (during the stress test). Consequently, our test device was louder than the Asus and the Samsung which also struggle with throttling during full load. We will examine if this is the case in Toshiba's laptop in the following section. Noise Level Idle 32.5 / 33.3 / 34.8 dB(A)",
