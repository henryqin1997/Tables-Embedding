In considering the form and amount of equity award to be granted to each executive officer, the Compensation Committee considers a variety of factors, including the performance of the Company and each executive officer in the prior year, means to incent performance and encourage retention of each executive officer, the mix of cash and equity being awarded to other senior executives, each executive officer's current equity holdings, trends in executive compensation best practices, and the market environment generally. In December 2007, the Compensation Committee awarded RSUs to the executive officers as the equity component of the Annual Incentive for Fiscal 2007., 528215=The EICP allows the Compensation Committee (or, in certain situations, its delegate) to grant to certain employees of the Firm annual awards of two types: \"Standard Bonuses\" and \"Performance Bonuses\" (each, a \"Bonus\"). Bonuses may be granted to members of the Firm's Executive Committee or other Managing Directors of the Firm. As of February\u00a015, 2008, approximately 1,500 individuals were eligible to participate in the EICP., 458097=The Audit Committee is informed on a timely basis, and in any event by the next scheduled meeting, of all services rendered by the independent registered public accounting firm and the related fees. The Audit Committee has delegated its pre-approval authority to its Chairman. In the event the Chairman pre-approves any service, he reports such pre-approval to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. None of the services described above under \"Fees for Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006\" was approved by the Audit Committee after the fact in reliance upon the de minimis exception to the SEC's rules requiring pre-approval of such services., 420118=To the extent permitted by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Directors and executive officers of the Company and their associates, including family members, from time to time may be or may have been indebted to the Company or its subsidiaries under lending arrangements offered by those companies to the public. For example, such persons may be or may have been indebted to LBI as customers, in connection, 468858=The Firm's stockholders approved an increase in the shares available for issuance under the 2005 SIP from 20\u00a0million shares to 95\u00a0million shares in April 2007. Under the terms of the 2005 SIP, 33.5\u00a0million shares of Common Stock that remained unawarded upon the expiration of the Company's 1996 Plan and EIP in 2006 also became available for Awards under the 2005 SIP. In addition, any shares of Common Stock subject to repurchase or forfeiture rights under an award that has been granted under the 2005 SIP, the 1996 Plan or the EIP that are reacquired by the Company, any shares of Common Stock that are withheld or delivered pursuant to the terms of the 2005 SIP in payment of any applicable exercise price or tax withholding obligation, and any award relating to shares of Common Stock under any of such plans that is canceled, terminates or expires or, for any other reason is not payable, become available for new Awards. At the time, the Company expected the April 2007 increase to cover stock-based awards until 2009, including awards for fiscal years 2007 and 2008. As of February\u00a015, 2008, the Company had only 28\u00a0million shares available for future Awards under the 2005 SIP (subject to increases as described above), which is not expected to be sufficient for fiscal 2008., 213948=Annual Incentive Formulas.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Fiscal 2007 performance-based Annual Incentives payable under the EICP, the Compensation Committee established formulas at the beginning of the fiscal year based on percentages of the Company's income before taxes, the cumulative effect of accounting changes, and extraordinary items (collectively, \"Pre-tax Income\"). The Compensation Committee chose to use the Company's Pre-tax Income as the basis for the formulas because it is a stable measure of the Company's financial performance. The formula assigned to each executive officer was based on his role and responsibilities but did not specify a target award. These incentive formulas were principally established in order to qualify the Annual Incentives as performance-based compensation for purposes under Section\u00a0162(m) of the Code., 376259=All U.S. employees of the Company or a designated subsidiary who have attained the age of 21 and completed one year of service are generally eligible to participate in the U.S. Pension Plan. The U.S. Pension Plan formula provides for an annual retirement benefit payable at age 65, calculated as a straight life annuity. Pensionable earnings are total Form\u00a0W-2 earnings (plus elective deferrals under the Lehman Brothers Savings Plan and certain other health plan deferral amounts) up to the applicable Internal Revenue Service maximum. For each year of plan participation prior to 1989, the annual accrual was based on percentages of pensionable earnings up to and in excess of the Social Security taxable wage base. After 1988 the annual accrual is equal to 1% of pensionable earnings up to the average Social Security taxable wage base plus 1.65% of pensionable earnings in excess of the average Social Security taxable wage base. Generally, participants have a nonforfeitable right to their accrued benefits upon completing five years of vesting service. As of November\u00a030, 2007, the estimated annual projected benefits payable upon retirement at a normal retirement age of 65 for Messrs.\u00a0Fuld, Gregory, Russo, O'Meara and Lowitt are approximately $103,265, $116,686, $39,873, $87,689 and $94,559, respectively. Messrs.\u00a0Fuld, Gregory and Russo are also eligible for early retirement under the plan, which is based on attaining age 55 with five years of service, that would provide an estimated annual projected benefit as of November\u00a030, 2007 in the amounts of $66,260, $37,446 and $33,086, respectively., 20038=A copy of the Company's 2007 Annual Report to Stockholders is enclosed herewith for all stockholders., 215612=percentage is fixed). The incentive formula is expected to yield a bonus payment, except in the event of a loss. These formulas set the maximum Annual Incentive for Messrs.\u00a0Fuld, Gregory, Russo and the other executive officers equal to 0.75%, 0.57%, 0.50%, and 0.25% of Pre-tax Income, respectively, based on the Company's Fiscal 2007 Pre-tax Income of $6.0\u00a0billion, which was associated with a Return on Tangible Shareholder's Equity of 25.7%. In December 2007, the Compensation Committee adjusted the formula applicable to Mr.\u00a0Gregory for Fiscal 2008 to provide itself greater flexibility in providing him with enhanced incentive opportunity., 279740=2007 GRANTS OF PLAN-BASED AWARDS, 76257=Theatrical Producer.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr.\u00a0Berlind, who is also a private investor, has been a theatrical producer and principal of Berlind Productions since 1981. Mr.\u00a0Berlind is also a Governor of the Broadway League and has served as a Trustee of Princeton University, the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center, the MacDowell Colony and the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. Mr.\u00a0Berlind serves as a member of the Audit Committee and the Finance and Risk Committee., 542929=The Free Enterprise Action Fund, represented by Action Fund Management,\u00a0LLC, 12309 Briarbush Lane, Potomac, MD 20854, the holder of approximately 452 shares of Common Stock, has proposed the adoption of the following resolution and has furnished the following statement in support of its proposal:, 492657=However, with respect to any Award granted after November\u00a08, 2007, a \"Change in Control\" is deemed to occur when: (1)\u00a070% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's voting securities is acquired in certain instances (whether through a tender offer, merger, or otherwise); (2)\u00a0a merger, consolidation, recapitalization or reorganization involving the Company occurs, whereby the stockholders immediately prior to such transaction cease to hold at least 30% of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the corporation resulting from such transaction, the individuals who were members of the Board of Directors immediately prior to the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction cease to constitute at least 50% of the board of directors of the resulting corporation, or a person or entity becomes the beneficial owner of 70% or more of the combined voting power of the resulting corporation; (3)\u00a0within a consecutive twelve month period, a majority of the individuals who are members of the Board of Directors are replaced with individuals who do not receive endorsement by a majority of the Board of Directors before the date of the appointment or election of such individuals; or (4)\u00a0a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company., 522318=As of November\u00a030, 2007, there were available for future issuance:, 484297=Other Stock-Based Awards.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other Awards of Common Stock and Awards that are valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, the fair market value of Common Stock (all such Awards being referred to herein as \"Other Stock-based Awards\"), may be granted under the 2005 SIP in the discretion of the Compensation Committee. Other Stock-based Awards will be in such form as the Compensation Committee will determine, including without limitation, (1)\u00a0the right to purchase shares of Common Stock, (2)\u00a0shares of Common Stock subject to restrictions on transfer until the completion of a specified period of service, the occurrence of an event or the attainment of performance objectives, each as specified by the Compensation Committee, (3)\u00a0shares of Common Stock issuable upon the completion of a specified period of service, the occurrence of an event, or the attainment of performance objectives, each as specified by the Compensation Committee and (4)\u00a0dividend equivalent rights with respect to Common Stock subject to any Award. Any Other Stock-based Awards that are granted subject to the completion of a specified period of service by the Award recipient that are (1)\u00a0not in lieu of cash compensation to employees generally, (2)\u00a0not paid to recruit a new employee in an amount less than 5% of the total Awards available for grant under the 2005 SIP or (3)\u00a0not subject to the attainment of performance objectives, will provide that vesting, restrictions on transfer, or some other comparable restriction that encourages continued performance of the Award recipient, will in any such case be for a period of not less than three years (although vesting or lapsing of restrictions may occur in installments over such period), unless there is a Change in Control (as such term is defined in \"Change of Control\" below) or the Award recipient retires, becomes disabled or dies. Other Stock-based Awards may be granted alone or in addition to any other Awards made under the 2005 SIP. With respect to any RSUs or PSUs granted under the 2005 SIP, the obligations of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company are limited solely to the delivery of shares of Common Stock on the date when such shares of Common Stock are due to be delivered under each Award agreement, and in no event will the Company or any subsidiary of the Company become obligated to pay cash in respect of such obligation (except that the Company or any subsidiary of the Company may pay to the Award recipient amounts in cash in respect of a RSU or PSU equal to cash dividends paid to a holder of the same number of shares of Common Stock that are subject to the RSU or PSU)., 424258=The table below sets forth for each of the limited partners listed (1)\u00a0the amount of distributions of profits from all of the existing investment partnerships during Fiscal 2007, (2)\u00a0the outstanding balance, as of November\u00a030, 2007, of the aggregate preferred capital contributions made by the general partner of these investment partnerships as a result of investments made by such limited partners and (3)\u00a0the aggregate, 479071=Shares Available for Awards.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As amended, a total of 178.5\u00a0million shares of Common Stock may be subject to Awards under the 2005 SIP (including 33.5\u00a0million shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under the Company's 1996 Plan and EIP that remained unawarded upon the expiration of those plans in 2006). In addition, if any shares of Common Stock subject to repurchase or forfeiture rights under an award that has been granted under the 2005 SIP, the 1996 Plan or the EIP are reacquired by the Company, or if any shares of Common Stock are withheld or delivered pursuant to the terms of the 2005 SIP in payment of any applicable exercise price or tax withholding obligation, or if any award relating to shares of Common Stock under any of such plans is canceled, terminates or expires or, for any other reason is not payable, such shares will become available for new Awards. No 2005 SIP participant may receive options, SARs or other stock-based Awards during any fiscal year attributable to more than four million shares of Common Stock, subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the 2005 SIP. The shares of Common Stock issuable under the 2005 SIP may be either authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares, or any combination thereof., 496724=Awards to be Granted Under the 2005 SIP.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The number or type of Awards that will be granted under the 2005 SIP to any participants will be determined at the discretion of the Compensation Committee and therefore cannot be calculated at this time., 518245=Awards with respect to 52.5\u00a0million shares of Common Stock have been made under the 2005 SIP as of November\u00a030, 2007. The number of shares remaining available for future issuance under the 2005 SIP as of November\u00a030, 2007, is calculated as follows:, 227608=Compensation Committee's Determination of Fiscal 2007 Compensation, 225105=After considering the information described above, the Compensation Committee exercised discretion for each executive officer on an individual basis to provide Annual Incentive awards that were below the maximum amounts provided for under the pre-established incentive formulas described above. In its determination of the Annual Incentive for each of the executive officers other than Mr.\u00a0Fuld, the Compensation Committee was most strongly influenced by the performance evaluations and compensation recommendations presented by Mr.\u00a0Fuld and Mr.\u00a0Gregory, and by the Company's Fiscal 2007 financial performance., 242223=The Compensation and Benefits Committee reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management and, based on such review and discussions, the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Proxy Statement on Schedule\u00a014A for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission and incorporated by reference in the Company's 2007 Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K., 201047=Supplemental Retirement Plan.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Messrs.\u00a0Fuld, Gregory and Russo participate in the Lehman Brothers Supplemental Retirement Plan (the \"SRP\"), a nonqualified, noncontributory, defined benefit plan. See \"Pension Benefits\" below. The SRP was established to provide selected executives an additional fixed annual retirement benefit above the amount limited by qualified plan restrictions. The Compensation Committee, which adopted the plan in 1998, has not increased the annual benefit amounts since the plan's inception. The Compensation Committee determines the participants in the SRP and generally bases this determination on an executive's tenure and his or her historical performance at the Company., 50334=Amendment of the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The affirmative vote of the majority of the shares of common stock present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting is required to amend the 2005 SIP, provided that a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock are voted on the proposal. In determining whether the proposal has received the requisite number of affirmative votes, abstentions will be counted and will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal. Broker non-votes are not considered \"shares present\" for voting purposes, but may affect the voting to the extent that the broker non-votes cause less than a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock to be voted on the matter., 536439=Mrs.\u00a0Evelyn Y. Davis, with an office at the Watergate Office Building, 2600 Virginia Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20037, the holder of 200 shares of Common Stock, has proposed the adoption of the following resolution and has furnished the following statement in support of her proposal:, 211103=In November 2007 the Compensation Committee also amended the SRP primarily to avoid potential adverse tax consequences under Section\u00a0409A. Among other technical changes, the definition of a change in control under the SRP was amended principally to provide that a change in control would occur upon, among other things, the acquisition of at least 50% of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities or of at least 30% of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities within a 12-month period. Prior to the amendment, a change in control would have been triggered by the acquisition of at least 20% of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities. The Compensation Committee made the minimum changes to the SRP that are required by the new provisions of Section\u00a0409A because, unlike prospective equity awards, an amendment made to the SRP affects benefits already accrued under the SRP by the participants. At that time, the Compensation Committee also amended outstanding equity awards to employees generally to comply with the minimum standards of Section\u00a0409A., 641234=immediately prior to the applicable date of expiration of each of the Lehman Brothers Holdings\u00a0Inc. Employee Incentive Plan and the Lehman Brothers Holdings\u00a0Inc. 1996 Management Ownership Plan (each, a \"Prior Plan\"), are available for issuance and not otherwise subject to outstanding Awards granted under the Prior Plans, increased by the number of Shares that, as of each such applicable expiration date, were subject to Awards granted and outstanding under the Prior Plans (the \"Prior Awards\") but which are subsequently not payable or distributable under the Prior Awards under any of the circumstances described in paragraph\u00a0(ii), (iii)\u00a0or (iv)\u00a0of subsection\u00a0(b) above., 480461=Stock Options.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A stock option, which may be a non-qualified or an incentive stock option (each, an \"Option\"), is the right to purchase a specified number of shares of Common Stock at a price (the \"Option Price\") fixed by the Compensation Committee (any holder of an Option is called an \"Optionee\"). The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be subject to incentive stock options (\"ISOs\") granted pursuant to the 2005 SIP is 20\u00a0million, subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the 2005 SIP. The Option Price of an Option may be no less than the fair market value of the underlying Common Stock on the date of grant. Unless otherwise provided in the Optionee's Award agreement, Options are not transferable during the Optionee's lifetime and will expire no later than ten years after the date on which they are granted. Options become exercisable at such times and in such installments as the Compensation Committee will determine. The Compensation Committee may also accelerate the period for exercise of any or all Options held by an Optionee. Payment of the Option Price must be made in full at the time of exercise of the Option by any of the following methods: (1)\u00a0in cash; (2)\u00a0by tendering to the Company shares of Common Stock having a fair market value equal to the Option Price, which shares have been held by the Optionee for at least six months and which meet such other requirements as may be imposed by the Compensation Committee; (3)\u00a0by certain withholding methods that constitute a cashless exercise through the delivery of irrevocable instructions by the Optionee to a broker to sell the Common Stock received upon exercise of the Option and to deliver promptly to the Company an amount out of the proceeds equal to the aggregate Option Price, or (4)\u00a0by other means that the Compensation Committee deems appropriate., 13431=March\u00a05, 2008, 303191=The 2006 Performance-Based RSUs, granted on December\u00a08, 2006, were contingent on achieving a threshold level of return on equity (\"ROE\") for Fiscal 2007 of 10%, which was achieved. The 2006 Performance-Based RSUs will vest at the end of five years, with accelerated vesting if and when the Company's stock price achieves specified targets for five consecutive trading days. The target prices, which are set at $100, $108, and $116, will, if achieved, accelerate vesting but to no earlier than one-third per year beginning on November\u00a030, 2007. See \"Elements of Compensation in Prior Years\u0097Performance-Based RSU Grants\" in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section., 554350=In accordance with a notice sent previously to certain beneficial owners holding shares in street name (for example, through a bank, broker or other holder of record) and who share a single address with other similar holders, only one annual report and proxy statement is being sent to that address unless contrary instructions were received from any stockholder at that address. This practice, known as \"householding,\" is designed to reduce printing and postage costs. Any of such beneficial owners may discontinue householding by writing to the address or calling the telephone number provided for such purpose by their holder of record. Any such stockholder may also request prompt delivery of a copy of the annual report or proxy statement by contacting the Company at 1-212-526-0858 or by writing to the Corporate Secretary, Lehman Brothers Holdings\u00a0Inc., 1271 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10020., 407335=Involuntary Termination Without Cause.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Most equity awards to named executive officers include provisions that are designed to provide some protection of their awards in the event of involuntary termination without cause. If on November\u00a030, 2007 Messrs.\u00a0Fuld, Gregory, Russo, O'Meara or Lowitt had been involuntary terminated without cause, the value of equity awards subject to accelerated vesting and/or delivery would have been $241,089,827, $174,116,262, $32,469,268, $4,295,714 and $5,290,029, respectively. In the event of an involuntary termination with cause, these awards are forfeited and cancelled. The definition of \"cause\" is defined in the equity award agreements, forms of which are filed as exhibits to the Company's 2007 Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K., 157736=Co-Chief Administrative Officer. Mr.\u00a0Freidheim has been the Co-Chief Administrative Officer of the Company since October 2006 and is an Executive Vice President of the Company. Mr.\u00a0Freidheim also has been the Chief of Staff to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer since 1996. He was Global Head of Strategy from 2005 to 2007 and Global Head of Corporate Communications, Advertising, Marketing and Brand Strategy from 2003 to 2007. Mr.\u00a0Freidheim joined the Company in 1991. He is actively involved with the Institute of International Education (\"IIE\"), where he is a member of the Board of Trustees, a member of IIE's Scholar Rescue Fund Board of Directors and Selection Committee, and co-founder and chairman of IIE's New Leaders Group. Additionally, Mr.\u00a0Freidheim is a member of The Forum of Young Global Leaders of the World Economic Forum, a member of the Executive Advisory Board of Sponsors for Educational Opportunity, a member of Young Presidents' Organization and a member of The Economic Club of New York., 851=Proxy Statement Pursuant to Section\u00a014(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Amendment No.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0), 238381=All of the RSUs awarded to the executive officers for Fiscal 2007 are subject to forfeiture restrictions and cannot be sold or transferred until they convert to Common Stock at the end of five years. The RSU awards to Messrs.\u00a0Fuld, Gregory and Russo vest over three years while awards to Messrs.\u00a0O'Meara and Lowitt vest over two years. Factors which influenced the terms and conditions of the RSU awards awarded to each executive officer, including the vesting provisions, included: the role and responsibilities of each executive officer; the vesting schedules of equity awards to other senior executives; executive retention; and accounting expense. In particular, the vesting provisions of the RSUs awarded to the executive officers were influenced by the fact that these awards did not include a \"full career\" or retirement vesting feature, which had been included in Annual Incentive equity awards in prior years that vested over five-year periods. See the discussion of this feature in the narrative following the Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal 2007 Year-End table below., 196181=Performance Stock Units.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Compensation Committee previously granted Performance Stock Units periodically to selected executives, including Messrs.\u00a0Fuld, Gregory and Russo, under four separate programs established in 1995, 1996, 1997 and 2000. The Performance Stock Unit grants provided long-term incentive opportunities based on the then financial goals of the Company and have been attributed by the Compensation Committee to compensation earned for prior years, even though some Performance Stock Unit awards converted to Common Stock in Fiscal 2007, and other Performance Stock Unit awards have not yet converted., 508289=The following table sets forth certain information as of November\u00a030, 2007 regarding shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under the Firm's equity compensation plans. The table does not reflect (1)\u00a0approximately 49.7\u00a0million of RSUs which were granted to employees on December\u00a07, 2007 and (2)\u00a0approximately 1.7\u00a0million of RSUs and 1.2\u00a0million of stock options which were granted to employees on February\u00a09, 2008. As of February\u00a015, 2008, there were approximately 28\u00a0million shares available for future Awards under the 2005 SIP, subject to increases as previously described., 189913=The overall objective in determining total compensation levels across the Company is to balance competitive pressures in the market for professional talent with cost considerations. Since the securities industry is fundamentally a human capital intensive business, compensation and benefits are a significant and critical expense. Among the firms within our industry, these expenses typically account for between 45% and 50% of net revenues, and in 2007, compensation and benefits expenses among some firms approached 60% of net revenues. In Fiscal 2007, the Company's compensation and benefits expense was 49.3% of net revenues., 186271=Lehman Brothers' human capital strategy is to attract and retain the most talented employees and to strongly align their interests with maximizing Company performance and stockholder return. Our strategy regarding our employees has remained consistent since becoming a public company in 1994 and, we believe, has been instrumental in helping the Company achieve its goals over time., 19265=The Company will admit to the Annual Meeting (1)\u00a0all stockholders of record as of the close of business on February\u00a015, 2008, (2)\u00a0persons holding proof of beneficial ownership as of such date, such as a letter or account statement from the person's broker, (3)\u00a0persons who have been granted proxies, and (4)\u00a0such other persons that the Company, in its sole discretion, may elect to admit. All persons wishing to be admitted must present photo identification. If you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, please check the appropriate box on your proxy card or register your intention when voting online or by telephone according to the instructions provided., 468232=NYSE rules require that the Company obtain stockholder approval of the Plan Amendment in order for it to be effective. Stockholder approval of the Plan Amendment also will permit the Company to continue to grant tax-deductible performance-based awards under the 2005 SIP to the Chief Executive Officer and certain other executive officers. The 2005 SIP has been designed to permit it to be administered to grant performance-based awards to executive officers, which would qualify for full tax deductibility by the Company under Section\u00a0162(m) of the Code., 303958=The 2006 Year-end RSUs, granted on December\u00a08, 2006, are subject to vesting and forfeiture restrictions and cannot be sold or transferred until they convert to Common Stock on November\u00a030, 2011, approximately five years after the grant date. 35% of the RSUs will vest on November\u00a030, 2009 and the balance will vest on November\u00a030, 2011., 216337=Performance Evaluation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the beginning of Fiscal 2007, performance objectives for each executive officer were established for the upcoming year by Mr.\u00a0Fuld and Mr.\u00a0Gregory, with input from the Compensation Committee and the other executive officers and consistent with the Firm's strategy, and included:, 227369=The table below provides the dollar value of the salary and Annual Incentive approved by the Compensation Committee for each of the named executive officers for Fiscal 2007., 205369=Liquidity Limits.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Compensation Committee approves an annual \"liquidity limit\" for certain executives, including Messrs.\u00a0Fuld, Gregory and Russo. In determining whether an executive will be subject to the liquidity limits, the Compensation Committee considers factors such as the executive's role and responsibilities at the Company, and the executive's existing individual equity holdings in the Company. Expressed as a maximum percentage of an executive's total equity holdings in the Company (including outstanding equity awards) that may be sold in any given year, the effect of these liquidity limits has been to promote a high level of stock ownership by the Company's senior management team.

In evaluating the performance of Mr.\u00a0Fuld, the Compensation Committee was strongly influenced by the Company's financial performance in Fiscal 2007, his role in leading the Company through the challenging market environment, and orchestrating the Company's strategic direction and objectives including the continued diversification of the Company across businesses, regions and products which was important to the Company's financial performance in Fiscal 2007., 16637=The 2008 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Lehman Brothers Holdings\u00a0Inc.

Section\u00a0409A generally establishes new rules that must be followed with respect to covered deferred compensation arrangements in order to avoid the imposition of an additional 20% tax (plus interest) upon the service provider who is entitled to receive the deferred compensation. Certain Awards that may be granted under the 2005 SIP may constitute \"deferred compensation\" within the meaning of and subject to Section\u00a0409A. While the Compensation Committee intends to administer and operate the 2005 SIP and establish terms (or make required amendments) with respect to Awards subject to Section\u00a0409A in a manner that will avoid the imposition of additional taxation under Section\u00a0409A upon a participant, there can be no assurance that additional taxation under Section\u00a0409A will be avoided in all cases. In the event the Company is required to delay delivery of shares or any other payment under an Award in order to avoid the imposition of an additional tax under Section\u00a0409A, the Company will deliver such shares (or make such payment) on the first day that would not result in the participant incurring any tax liability under Section\u00a0409A. The Compensation Committee may amend the 2005 SIP and outstanding Awards to preserve the intended benefits of Awards granted under the 2005 SIP and to avoid the imposition of an additional tax under Section\u00a0409A of the Code., 46170=FOR the amendment of the Company's 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the \"2005 SIP\");, 112236=The Nominating Committee held five meetings during Fiscal 2007., 240848=As discussed above, the Compensation Committee made its decisions concerning stock-based Fiscal 2007 compensation based on the grant date value of the awards for the fiscal year for which they are awarded, as shown in the table above, and not based on accounting expense for the fiscal year as required to be shown in the Summary Compensation Table.

Such products and services must be provided on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable financial products and services provided to unaffiliated third parties who are not employees of the Firm, provided that financial products and services provided to executive officers or their immediate family members may be provided on substantially the same terms as those extended to employees of the Firm generally. In addition, executive officers may invest in partnerships or other investment opportunities sponsored, or otherwise made available, by the Firm if the investment opportunity is offered to all qualified employees who are Vice Presidents or above at the Firm on the same terms as, or better than, those offered to the executive officers. Products and services provided to the Firm in the ordinary course of the Firm's business and on arm's-length terms by any person that is a beneficial owner of more than 5% of our Common Stock or an immediate family member of such person, and any transaction involving products and services provided to the Firm by a person pursuant to a contract in existence prior to the time it becomes known to the Firm that such person is a beneficial owner of more than 5% of our Common Stock or an immediate family member of such person, are also deemed to be pre-approved in the Policy., 415534=Directors determined that these investments do not constitute material relationships that would impair a Director's independence because no Director has made any commitment to any of such investment partnerships since August 2001 and none of the rights of Directors as limited partners in these investment partnerships are contingent in any way on their continued service as Directors., 111297=In May 2006, the Nominating Committee engaged Ridgeway Partners\u00a0LLC, a third-party search firm to conduct a search to identify and attract potential director candidates. In the course of its engagement, Ridgeway Partners\u00a0LLC has identified and provided background information about Mr.\u00a0Grundhofer and other potential director candidates and continues to do so., 154014=Prior to May 1994, the Company maintained the Retirement Plan for Non-Management Directors which was a nonqualified retirement plan providing a limited annual retirement benefit for non-management Directors who had earned five or more years of service as defined in the plan. Participation in this plan was frozen on May\u00a031, 1994. Any non-management Director who had, on such date, completed at least five years of service as a Director (determined in accordance with the plan) has vested benefits under the plan. Any individual who was a non-management Director on such date, but had not completed five years of service as of such date, acquired vested benefits under this plan at the time such individual completed such five years of service as a Director. Any individual who became a non-management Director after such date was ineligible to participate in this plan. Vested benefits under this plan are paid after a participant ceases to be a Director. Based upon years of service prior to May 1994, Mr.\u00a0Berlind is entitled to $20,000 annually in equal quarterly payments, for seven years following retirement under this plan. Any such payments would cease upon death., 467387=The 2005 SIP is administered by the Compensation Committee, which is comprised of four independent Directors. The 2005 SIP provides for the granting of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights and other stock-based awards, including restricted stock, RSUs and PSUs (collectively, \"Awards\"). The Compensation Committee has discretion to select the individuals to whom Awards will be granted and to determine the type, size and terms of each Award and has the authority to administer, construe and interpret the 2005 SIP. The 2005 SIP is primarily intended to provide broad-based equity compensation awards across all levels of the Firm. Approximately 20,000 employees were granted equity awards as a portion of their Fiscal 2007 compensation., 487127=The Compensation Committee may establish the performance objectives that must be attained in order for the Company to grant Other Stock-based Awards. Accordingly, unless the Compensation Committee determines at the time of grant not to qualify such an award as performance-based compensation under Section\u00a0162(m) of the Code, the performance objectives for such Other Stock-based Awards made under the 2005 SIP will be based upon one or more of the following criteria: (1)\u00a0pre-tax income or net income; (2)\u00a0earnings per share; (3)\u00a0book value per share; (4)\u00a0stock price; (5)\u00a0return on equity; (6)\u00a0expense management; (7)\u00a0return on investment; (8)\u00a0improvements in capitalization; (9)\u00a0profitability of an identifiable business unit or product; (10)\u00a0profit margins; (11)\u00a0budget comparisons; (12)\u00a0total return to stockholders; (13)\u00a0net revenue; and (14)\u00a0economic value added. The Compensation Committee must certify as to the attainment of the applicable performance goals prior to payment of any Other Stock-based Award, and may reduce the amount of any Other Stock-based Award. Subject to the provisions of the 2005 SIP, the Compensation Committee will have sole and absolute discretion to determine to whom and when such Other Stock-based Awards will be made, the number of shares of Common Stock to be awarded under (or otherwise related to) such Other Stock-based Awards, and all other terms and conditions of such Awards. The Compensation Committee will determine whether Other Stock-based Awards will be settled in cash, Common Stock or a combination of cash and Common Stock. The maximum amount of Other Stock-based Awards that may be granted during any fiscal year to any participant in the 2005 SIP will be (1)\u00a0with respect to Other Stock-based Awards that are denominated or payable in Common Stock, four million shares of Common Stock, and (2)\u00a0with respect to Other Stock-based Awards that are not denominated or payable in Common Stock, $50.0\u00a0million., 114968=The Board of Directors held eight meetings and acted by unanimous written consent two times during Fiscal 2007.

Overall Director attendance at Board and Board Committee meetings during Fiscal 2007 was 96%. The number of meetings held by each Committee during Fiscal 2007 is set forth above., 466723=Upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors has adopted an amendment (the \"Plan Amendment\") to the Company's 2005 SIP to increase the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which awards may be granted under the plan by 50\u00a0million shares, subject to approval by the Stockholders at the Annual Meeting. The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that the Stockholders approve the Plan Amendment in order to permit the Company to continue to compensate employees, directors and consultants in part with stock-based awards rather than cash., 364088=The Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal 2007 Year-End table above excludes RSUs that are earned and vested, which include those awards for which the employee has completed any service required to be performed in exchange for the award, rather than the vesting schedule specified within the respective award agreements. Reporting awards in this manner is consistent with the treatment of the related compensation expense for financial statement reporting purposes under FAS\u00a0123R. Certain RSUs earned under the Company's Performance Stock Unit programs established in 1995, 1996, 1997 and 2000 are considered to have vested as a result of their performance conditions having been met. Awards that are earned and vested also include those awards that include a \"full career\" vesting feature. The Company's equity award programs include a definition of \"full career\" treatment, which allows eligible employees to receive awards with a \"full career\" vesting feature on the originally scheduled delivery date following voluntary termination or involuntary termination without cause, provided that they do not engage in competitive or detrimental activity. Accordingly, (1)\u00a0any performance-based awards are reported in this Proxy Statement as vesting at the time the performance conditions have been met and (2)\u00a0any awards for which the recipient is eligible for \"full career\" treatment under the terms of the award are reported in this Proxy Statement as vesting at the time of the award or, if later, the time when the recipient becomes eligible for \"full career\" treatment, even though any such awards may not be payable for some period of time and may be forfeitable if the recipient engages in competitive or detrimental activity or is involuntarily terminated with cause. Messrs.\u00a0Fuld, Gregory and Russo are eligible for \"full career\" treatment, and Mr.\u00a0O'Meara became eligible for \"full career\" treatment in 2006. In addition, certain RSU grants to Mr.\u00a0O'Meara and Mr.\u00a0Lowitt were not performance-based awards or subject to \"full career\" treatment, but have vested under the terms of these awards. The number of RSUs that are earned and vested and held by Messrs.\u00a0Fuld, Gregory, Russo, O'Meara and Lowitt at November\u00a030, 2007 are 4,605,884, 3,363,060, 785,467, 66,297 and 18,449, respectively., 473113=Broad-Based Equity Compensation Program.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Company has one of the most broad-based equity programs among our competitors. In Fiscal 2007, close to 20,000 employees received equity awards as part of their annual total compensation. The Company believes that stock-based awards foster an employee-ownership culture that aligns the interests of its employees directly with those of its stockholders and encourages employees to be prudent risk managers and to work together to ensure the Firm's continued financial success over time., 116061=The following table shows, for the year ended November\u00a030, 2007, the cash and other compensation of the non-management members of the Board of Directors for services in all capacities., 565826=DIRECTIONS TO THE LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS\u00a0INC. 2008 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS, 212763=As noted above, the elements of compensation considered by the Compensation Committee as part of each executive officer's total annual compensation for Fiscal 2007 consisted of base salary and an Annual Incentive. Differences in total annual compensation levels among the executive officers are based on their individual roles and responsibilities within the Company and their individual performance. The amount of the Annual Incentive granted to each executive officer was determined by the Compensation Committee, limited by the Annual Incentive performance formulas established by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of the fiscal year, and influenced by performance evaluations for the executive officers which took place following the end of the fiscal year., 490993=In general, with respect to any Award granted on or prior to November\u00a08, 2007, a \"Change in Control\" is deemed to occur when: (1)\u00a020% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's voting securities is acquired in certain instances (whether through a tender offer, merger, or otherwise); (2)\u00a0individuals who, as of the effective date of the 2005 SIP, are members of the Board of Directors or whose election or nomination is approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of such initial directors (the \"Incumbent Board\") cease, subject to certain exceptions, to constitute at least a majority of the Board of Directors; (3)\u00a0a merger, consolidation, recapitalization or reorganization involving the Company occurs, whereby the stockholders immediately prior to such transaction cease to hold at least 50% of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the corporation resulting from such transaction, members of the Incumbent Board immediately prior to the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction cease to constitute at least a 50% of the board of directors of the resulting corporation, or a person or entity becomes the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the combined voting power of the resulting corporation; (4)\u00a0a liquidation of the Company or a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or (5)\u00a0any event occurs that would constitute a \"Change in Control\" within the meaning of such term with respect to any Award granted after November\u00a08, 2007., 116316=2007 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION, 556301=In addition, in accordance with Article\u00a0II, Section\u00a09 of the Company's By-Laws, in order to be properly brought before the 2009 Annual Meeting by a stockholder, notice of a matter that is not included in the Company's proxy material must be received by the Company no earlier than December\u00a016, 2008 and no later than January\u00a015, 2009.

If Messrs.\u00a0Fuld, Gregory, Russo, O'Meara or Lowitt were to have died or become disabled on November\u00a030, 2007, the value of equity awards subject to accelerated vesting and/or delivery would have been $434,728,638, $311,932,271, $76,605,150, $9,301,020 and $7,984,047, respectively., 72237=Private Investor and Former President and Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's Holdings.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr.\u00a0Ainslie, a private investor, is the former President, Chief Executive Officer and a Director of Sotheby's Holdings. He was Chief Executive Officer of Sotheby's from 1984 to 1994. From 1980 to 1984, he was President and Chief Executive Officer of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. From 1975 to 1980, he was Chief Operating Officer of N-Ren Corp., a Cincinnati-based chemical manufacturer. From 1971 to 1975, he was President of Palmas Del Mar, a real estate development company. He began his career as an associate with McKinsey\u00a0& Company. Mr.\u00a0Ainslie is a Director of The St.\u00a0Joe Company and Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB. He is a Trustee of Vanderbilt University and a member (and the Chairman Emeritus) of the Board of Directors of The Posse Foundation,\u00a0Inc. Mr.\u00a0Ainslie serves as a member of the Audit Committee., 458967=In addition to the services provided to the Firm described above, Ernst\u00a0& Young\u00a0LLP provided audit and tax services to certain private investment funds managed by the Firm. The aggregate fees (including related expenses) for these services provided by Ernst\u00a0& Young\u00a0LLP related to Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006 were $9,316,000 and $7,166,000 for audit services and $6,621,000 and $5,340,000 for tax services, respectively, which consisted of the preparation and/or review of, and consultations with respect to, tax filings. Of such fees, $421,000 has been or is expected to be paid by the Firm related to Fiscal 2007 ($90,000 for audit services and $331,000 for tax services) and $435,000 was paid by the Firm related to Fiscal 2006 ($93,000 for audit services and $342,000 for tax services)., 415985=Mr.\u00a0Hernandez's son was employed by the Firm as a 2007 summer analyst and is expected to return as a summer analyst in 2008.

In the Summary Compensation Table, values reported for option awards and stock awards, including RSUs, are based on expense recognition for financial reporting purposes under FAS\u00a0123R. Under these accounting rules, the grant date fair value of equity awards is typically expensed over the required service period, which is usually the vesting period. For awards subject to \"full career\" treatment, however, the entire grant date fair value is expensed in the fiscal year for which it was earned. Since the Fiscal 2007 RSU awards to the executive officers were granted after the end of the fiscal year and require future service, no accounting expense for the awards was recognized during Fiscal 2007 and the values disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table do not reflect any portion of such awards. The values in the Summary Compensation Table reflect expense recognized in Fiscal 2007 for equity awards granted in prior fiscal years, including a portion of the Performance-Based RSUs granted in December 2006., 425191=amount of unreturned limited partner capital in all of the existing investment partnerships as of November\u00a030, 2007., 214906=The Fiscal 2007 incentive formula for each executive officer was based on percentages of Pre-tax Income, which percentages decline as the amount of Pre-tax Income increases up to $5.3\u00a0billion (beyond which the, 94085=The Executive Committee consists of Mr.\u00a0Fuld, who chairs the Executive Committee, and Mr.\u00a0Macomber. The Executive Committee has the authority, in the intervals between meetings of the Board of Directors, to exercise all the authority of the Board of Directors, except for those matters that the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation reserves to the full Board of Directors. The Executive Committee acted by unanimous written consent 16 times during the fiscal year ended November\u00a030, 2007 (\"Fiscal 2007\")., 366686=The following table sets forth information concerning the exercise of options and vesting of RSUs vesting during Fiscal 2007 by each of the named executive officers., 409935=Change in Control.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Most awards to the named executive officers include change in control provisions, as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section. In addition, most equity awards contain termination provisions that separately would affect the treatment of such awards in the event that an executive officer is terminated without cause following a change in control.

For Messrs.\u00a0Fuld and Gregory, full benefits are payable if, upon retirement, they are at least age 60 and have completed at least five years of service, or if their age plus years of service equals or exceeds the sum of 85. For these individuals, the SRP provides for the payment beginning at age 60 of reduced benefits payable if, upon retirement, they have not satisfied the requirements for full benefits but are above age 45 and have completed five years of service.

If Mr.\u00a0Russo had retired on November\u00a030, 2007, his reduced annual benefit payable in each of the 25\u00a0years following his reaching age 65 would be $655,789. In the event of a change in control, participants are considered to have met the eligibility for full benefits if the participant is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason within three years following a change in control. For Mr.\u00a0Russo, if such a termination occurred on November\u00a030, 2007 following a change in control, the present value of the increase in his accrued benefit to the full benefit would be equal to $1,091,728., 474891=Stockholder approval of the Plan Amendment is unanimously recommended by the Board in order to permit the Firm to continue to provide compensation using stock-based awards.
