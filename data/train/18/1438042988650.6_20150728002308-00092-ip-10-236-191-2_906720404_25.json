            "Since Texas Christian University is in Fort Worth, there are many food options. But, again, since I am not a student there, I cannot speak about the quality of the dining halls.",
            "While on my campus tour, we walked through the smallest hall of dorms TCU has to offer. The rooms were smaller, but still had enough room for comfort. For me, it would not be a problem living in their dorms.",
            "Since I have not attended, I am not a very liable source. But from all of my research, TCU is academically rigorous, but because of the high class of the school, will lead to success in the end",
            "Go look at campus, sit in on a class you're interested in, and ask questions to current students and staff. They are always happy to help you!",
            "TCU's campus is beautiful! While visiting campus, everyone I spoke to, only had great things to say about this school. They are a very proud community, and they should be!"

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{249482=TCU has a very large greek life including Panhellenic and National Panhellenic sororities and fraternities. Next year (2012-2013) they will be bringing several new sororities and fraternities to campus., 95958=Being an out-of-state student coming into Texas, I was worried about being an outsider. But really, the faculty is there to help. When I went to tour the school back in 2010, prospective students (and parents, alike) would come strike up a conversation with my mother and I. It was such a welcoming environment. Furthermore, everyone here wants to have fun, but learn as much as they can. It makes for a fun environment when you can go socialize with friends on the weekend and then study with the same friends during weekdays or finals. Having such eager classmates made finals week a breeze!, 24652=Private univerisities have more money available for scholarships than public colleges and universities do. So, don't let the initial tuition price cause sticker shock! Apply for all scholarships that are remotely applicable. Ask for financial help and fill out the FAFSA as soon as it is available on line on January 1 each year. The other more important consideration is that I can always get the classes I need, the classes are not impacted and I will graduate in 4 years. That is very good value., 505047=The food on TCU's campus is pretty good. There aren't many selections at the moment, but the dining complex is under a massive renovation that will open in January 2015 that will have a plethora of new dining options for students., 472957=The Christmas tree lighting every December is a big event, taken very seriously., 309359=Market Square isn't THE best. The first week you'll love it and then you'll have a hate/love relationship. There is a small Bistro in the library which is always convenient. As well as a Chipotle style restaurant in a building by the library. 1873 isn't too bad either! Just don't eat there all the time or you'll get sick of it. We also have Union Grounds which has TONS of snacks, which is also open late for those long study nights., 257749=TCU has so many different options when it comes to food. The main dining area is known as Market Square. When you walk in, the women who swipe you ID Card, make an effort to get to know you and ask how your day has been. When it came to selecting what to eat, there was always a plethora of options. From omelets to Mongolian barbecue, you could find your craving. There is also a burger joint known as 1873 (the year TCU was founded) that you can always find someone in. It stays open till 3am and is a popular hangout spot all hours of the day., 53169=Prospective students should definitely visit the school. Don't fall into the rah-rah hoopla of athletics like I almost did. Identify if your programs of interest are truly ranked by USNews. I looked and the best ranking I found was a program in the top 70. Most are not even in the top 100. Read the comments and you will notice the poor grammar of current students. The SAT scores are sub-par for good-to-top school. The (academic) rankings reflect. this., 444932=There's only one dining hall at TCU- Market Square. You will love this place...your first semester. It is the generic buffet-style eatery with everything under the sun to choose from. You will find that this gets very old and, after a while, turns into a cafeteria-style experience which is painfully reminiscent of high school. There are plenty of off-campus restaurants very close by though, and 1873 right downstairs from market square which is always a good meal. You won't go hungry, I'm sure., 407330=I've always been told by prospective students who come to visit that our dining hall is amazing in comparison to others. We always have an open salad bar. We have omelettes, stir fry, pizza, cereal, a sandwich line, round the clock smoothies, a delectable dessert station, and more. We also have other dining options on campus such as 1873, which opens for later hours in case you need a midnight study break! We have the Bistro Burnett in the library in case you need a snack or some coffee to keep you going. We have Sushi Mama in Smith Hall which offers food on the opposite side of campus so you don't have to make a cross campus trek just for lunch, not to mention our new Food Truck which offers food by Chef Tim Love. If you're at the gym and want to head over to NRG for a delicious smoothie or a healthy snack, the option is there! Not feeling anything on campus? We have great options just down the street from Potbelly's to Einstein's to Fuzzy's and McAlister's, not to mention Dutch's fabulous burgers which are half off on Tuesdays! If you're willing to venture a little farther out, West 7th street has an In N Out, great Sushi, phenomenal pizza, frozen yogurt and more. Finally, no TCU experience is complete without the infamous Sweet Sammies!, 486216=TCU has one of the best music programs in the country; our marching band is one of the best and our drumline is #1, our Symphonic Band is going to CBDNA (one of the best music conventions in the nation) in Spring 2014, and our Wind Symphony is going to TMEA (the best music convention because it is in Texas) in February 2014. At TCU, you are a name and NEVER a number., 43962=This is my only issue with TCU. Its becoming very hard to afford. Tuition is going up again in the fall of 2010 but hopefully my good ol' friends here at Cappex are going to help me out! Thank you Cappex I cant do it without you., 522639=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 462009=- Apply for Early Action (November 15). - Go all out on the Freedom of Expression. - Get to know people here, everybody is friendly. - Be yourself. As people are friendly, they are also welcoming to new ideas and cultures. - GO TO FROG CAMP! I attended Casa Nueva and absolutely loved it. I feel like I met some great friends there., 318631=Fort Worth has so many things to do! TCU offers a movie in the auditorium almost every Friday night. They have many activities by the CREW every afternoon just as painting, tye-dying, etc. There is always a concert during September that is free to all students! They bring in big names like Lady Antebellum, The Fray, and Blake Shelton., 33148=Here at TCU they are big on making sure their students know the material and are following through. It might just be my luck but it seems like all my professors really care about thier students and want their students to succeed. This is college so it seems like in a lot of my classes they go by pretty fast and you are expected to have knowledge to the basic material because of your high school education. However , if for some reason you're not at the level you should be at they have free worskshops and tutoring available for you. Even better the professors are easy to get ahold of during office hours. Whatever you do don't be afraid to go ahead and pay a visit before a test ... i promise you won't regret it. Some of them post some of their past test on ecollege so that you have an idea of what you should expect. I have one professor that e-mails all his students if he feels like he didn't teach the material well enough and sends notes to make the material clearer. They also offer different type of leadership seminars for free in which I am currently taking and I can tell you I am learning a lot! One of the reasons I really like it here is how easy it is to get help here. If you can't study in your own room, they have study rooms in all the halls and the library is a great place to study where they have quiet zones and zones for group work and there's always a lap top or computer available for your use. All the professors are required to give you a detailed syllabus so that the students know what to expect; it includes how the test work and how much it will count. If you want a school that is up in their game but willing to help you if you fall back TCU is the school for you! There is even a writing center where you can send your papers for free where they do spelling and grammar check for you., 272872=Market Square is amazing! It definitely increased my standard for college dining. It's all you can eat whenever you want to eat it. And when Market Square closes at 9PM, we have a restaurant called 1873 that stays open as late as 3AM. No need to leave campus!, 94770=This school is great choice, considering the price. Not only do you get a 1:15 typical professor-student ratio, but you also learn, and the professors make sure of it! While it wasn't the number one school for my major, it happens to be world-renowned for many of its other majors. Your money is well spent in beautiful facilities, clean dorms, great classes, a fun football team, and great academic opportunities. While walking around campus, you will notice the staff's deliberate upkeep of the buildings and the grounds. The school even plants brand new flowers every few weeks to keep the campus clean and beautiful! You get your money's worth in a variety of ways. I do feel that the school is slightly over-priced, however the school does a great job helping students with scholarships and financial aid. If a student talks to a counselor in the financial aid office, they will get help!, 402427=Students who are willing to be challenged will thrive here. TCU challenges not by focusing on GPA but by asking the right questions, granting real life opportunities, and offering new perspectives as food for thought. There's no one set major that will thrive most on TCU's campus because it's how much an individual will put in that he or she will receive the most benefits from such a great education. I have seen theater majors graduate and in less than a year have a steady career states away, business majors from the well known Neeley School come back for MBAs or as alumni who are offering internships and opportunities to current undergrads. Nursing students boast about their opportunities to do clinicals as early as sophomore year, engineering students moving on to world renowned institutions to continue their education, and more. Students who don't necessarily want a huge campus where you meet someone once and never see them again will find TCU to be a very comfortable home away from home. While you're always meeting new people, there is ample opportunities to create lasting friendships and the big school feel is really what you make of it. Finally, students who want to have that personal attention and have the opportunity to really make a difference and be recognized for it should definitely look into coming to TCU! The student to teacher ration is less than 20:1 and with our vast amount of resources and great alumni, there are always opportunities for hands on experience and a chance to make an impact., 475162=The student to teacher ratio is phenomenal, 13:1 if I am correct. Your teachers will always know you on a first name basis and be there to help out if extra help is needed. The campus is clean and full of spirit 24/7., 102480=After a while, the food at Market Square can seem boring and repetitive but I've heard that it's a lot worse at other colleges. All the food is definitely edible and for the most part, yummy. As a freshman, you get unlimited swipes into Market Square! Plus, there's 1873, Union Grounds, and a sushi place across campus that you can always go to. There's a row of restaurants near campus that students can walk to as well., 37963=I love being here! Both of my parents went to TCU and it had been my dream to go here and I am finally fulfilling my dream! It is everything I hoped for and more! We had One Republic play a concert for us back in October and we get lots of free stuff! Our football team is also going to a BCS Bowl and right now we are ranked #4 in the nation!, 359270=TCU's dining options are located in a central location in the University Union. Market Square is an all you can eat buffet style dining area where you can choose from pizza to burgers to Mongolian grill. This dining area is also Vegetarian friendly with many opts to serve your needs. TCU also offers 1873 a grill style restaurant on the first floor. Unlike Market Square, 1873 does not accept meal plans but they do accept Frog Bucks. There are also options just outside campus!, 328256=The food is great and the dining is great at TCU. TCU BLUU (brown lupton University Union) has three all inclusion places to get your grub on. There is your tradition cafeteria with a huge array of delicacies to be had from cereal to sushi, from pizza to Chinese. Then there is 1873, where you can get your milk shakes, burgers, chicken tenders, fries, salads, wraps, and then even have items for our non-meat eaters. Last but certainly not least the corner store or what I like to call the candy store. There are so many varieties of drinks, candies, ice creams, sodas, galore. Or, if you are just craving some fast food, there are a number of eatery within walking distance and when I say walking distance I don't mean miles; I mean minutes away., 78025=TCU is an amazing school! The academics are challenging, and our athletes are among the best (Go Frogs! Rose Bowl 2011 champs)!, 462525=I believe that Texas Christian University enables its faculty to educate its students to be ethical leaders in our world. Through over 100 undergraduate areas of study, TCU dynamically creates a learning environment suitable for all students of all career interests. My excitement is building up daily as I anticipate my arrival on campus in early August., 69204=I just transferred out of TCU in Fall 2010. I already want to be back. In fact I am coming back in the Fall of 2011. I go to TCC now and it does not even compare. At TCU it feels like all the professors are there to help you and be a part of your life. There is never a time when you feel like they hate their job or your not learning what your are supposed to be learning.}",
