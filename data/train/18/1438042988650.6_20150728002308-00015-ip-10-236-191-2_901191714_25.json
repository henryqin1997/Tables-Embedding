            "Our security works really hard to make sure we feel safe. There are secru-keys for all of the residence halls and everyone that is a student has one, so only students and staff can get access to the residence halls. We have emergency poles all around campus. Our security is even willing to walk with you at night if you feel uncomfortable.",
            "To my knowledge there are about 4 sororities.",
            "There are quite a few clubs here on campus, some are pretty awesome. I'm not a part of one personally, but I know quite a few people who are a part of some.",
            "Creative, friendly, kind, driven, willing to work, opinionated, different.",
            "Senior Hall is known to be one of the more haunted areas on campus. We have a friendly ghost named Sarah who is very protective over our college.",
            "Downtown is just a few blocks away from campus, there are lots of cool hangouts for you and your friends to relax and have a good time.",
            "It depends. I'm a picky eater, but most of the time there is always something good to eat.",
            "Some things aren't all that great about the dorms. They are rather old and sometimes it's a bit annoying, other than that, it's pretty decent.",
            "Everyone works really hard especially in their major classes and everyone strives to do their best.",
            "Make sure you apply for as many scholarships as possible. Every single bit of money helps!",

This is really good because it is preparing me for when I graduate. It is giving me the upper hand because, unlike most college graduates, I will have already had real life experience in my field. Also, last October the interior design department got to go to Joplin, Missouri and help with the Extreme Makeover: Home Edition project there. Stephens is really good about giving their students stuff to put on their resumes., 91892=You can call the Security number at 3:28 am and say you need an escort across our tiny campus, and they will either walk with you or pick you up in a van and bring you to your room. Locked out of your dorm? Give them three minutes. Lost downtown? Give them ten. They are some of the hardest working and most compassionate people on campus--and they'll let you in to just about any building on campus at any hour of the night if needed., 105080=Overall Stephens College is great. Last October we got to volunteer for Extreme Makeover: Home Edition in Joplin. Who knows where Stephens will take us next., 169694=Midnight Breakfast. One night during finals, the faculty and professors all dress up in a certain theme and host a breakfast for all the students at 10:00 at night! It's a great way to unwind and de-stress during finals week., 193403=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 84489=1. There are an abundance of ghost stories around here, if you're into that sort of thing. Several buildings are said to be haunted and many of the girls here will confirm that they've seen some pretty strange stuff go down. 2. Our dean wears only red shoes, and her reasons are quite hilarious. 3. The most prominent tradition however, dates back to 1921. Stephens has a list of Ten Ideals to which the students are supposed to adhere; respect, courage, independence, support, sensitivity, responsibility, belief, creativity, intelligence, and leadership. Originally it was the mission statement of the school to educate young women and help them realize these ideals within themselves. Today that tradition is going strong with the selection of The Ten. Every year ten girls are selected secretly by the staff and administration and rewarded for embodying one of these ideals. It is quite an honor to be selected as one of The Ten.}",

Food and Dining The flex plan needs to be reviewed and changed a bit, but other than that the food is pretty good. I have had a few not so good meals there, but all in all, its good. In three sentences When I started at Stephen's College, I was trying to choose between them and another school. I chose Stephen's and I have not been disappointed yet. Everyone is so caring and my education is very personal.
