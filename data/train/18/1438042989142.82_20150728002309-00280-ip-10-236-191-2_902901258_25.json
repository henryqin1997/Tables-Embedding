After taking an orientation to college all day presentation., 123454=If you are planning on taking the Wind Turbine Technician course at the Ingleside campus I would definitely recommend it. George Lister is a perfect teacher for learning all you need to know about the subject. Mrs. Trish is a great reference and teacher for the 1101 course. Everybody else that comes from the Harlingen campus and that you need to talk to on the phone are nice people., 9931=I am currently taking my basics here. I will be finished in May 2012, and from there I plan on transferring to a university that offers a major in business management., 107376=Stay on alert on your admissions process, financial aid and the 1101 course.

    "textAfterTable": "Did learn a lot The food managerial and food certification instructor at T.S.T.C. was always ready to guide us through the text-book materials. He would answer all of our questions or concerns, and make sure we were practicing well. Our instructor also made us take practice exercises, showed us training videos, and wrote on the chalk board about the new law requirements.

You can also take transferable core classes! Tips",
