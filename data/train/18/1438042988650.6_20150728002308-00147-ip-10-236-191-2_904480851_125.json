You share with a roomate depened on which dorm your stay in there only one co-ed dorm hall but thats for all the 4.0 students who has good grade., 551578=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 246020=Well Founded in 1904 by Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune, B-CU has become a leading institution of higher education, so I think that qualifies as a tradition to college students being allowed the right to higher their education and better themselves., 320268=ill tell you when i get there in the spring of 2013, 184115=The food has made a major turn around. Fall semester 2012-2013 the food wasn't too good but came fall semester we had a new dining company and a new addition called wow cafe, which is open passed cafeteria hours and offers different food. Also in the fall our school added a starbucks, which is awesome since i'm a big starbucks fan. I school is private so its doing the best that it can and with that i am highly appreciative., 243804=I received several forms about the greek life at Bethune.Membership in a fraternity or sorority is a good step toward enjoying all the benefits that college life has to offer. A fraternity or sorority chapter is also a way to make the campus feel more like a home. Collectively, fraternities and sororities constitute one of the largest student groups on campus. Fraternities and sororities are about friendships, scholarship, community service, brotherhood, sisterhood and leadership. It's about bettering the B-CU community and the city of Daytona Beach through service and social functions. It's about traditions, learning valuable lessons, and establishing life-long friendships. It's about shaping the identity of a continued greek life presence since 1948., 510585=There are many events to look forward to. For example, there is the Florida Blue Classic in November. This game is held against Florida A&M and is something you would not want to miss., 246553=I am a very positive Teenager and my family doesn't have the greatest of incomes with both my parents being on disability so I am struggling to pay for school and apply for scholarships. I haven't received one scholarship left but as Jesus stated never lose your faith in God. So I keep trying, I hear alot about how amazing Bethune Cookman college is and I look forward to attending their school in august. Thank you for your time and God bless, 266937=Bethune-Cookman University is a dream school i've always wanted to attend since my childhood days. My aunt is a Bethune-Cookman Alumni she graduated their in 2000 she gives me facts and opinion about this instituion and how i'll enjoy myself and education is great at this college also theirs great fields of study that will grasp my interest. They also offer everything that i need of a major., 10755=If your a penny pincher, Bethune Cookman is not the place for you, at all. I believe the reason to it being a private school makes Bethune-Cookman $12,000+ not including your everyday personal commmitments, necessities, or wants per semester. Multipliying that by two EASILY towers over the $24, 000 dollar mark for tuition. Thankfully, my financial aid covers atleast 95% of that which leaves me to cover about 2000 dollars on a payment plan per full school year which is a little, but still a lot paying out the pocket especially with a SINGLE mother still at home taking care of another child. Unfortunately, this is not the case for everyone attending The Great Bethune Cookman, I've already lost many easily met, close friends due to financial cituations, whos aid didn't cover as much as mine or any at all., 321419=An C school from what i heard but i will be attending in the spring of 2013, 466381=walk of faith every day at 10:20 church every wednesday party before games, 242733=To better inform you on campus safety I took the liberty of typing out word for word the safety form I received about Bethune.Campus Security Mission and Vision Bethune-Cookman University (B-CU) Office of Safety and Security will provide a safe and secure campus environment through collaborative, innovative, proactive and professional law enforcement and security initiatives that follow a community policing model of law enforcement.

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here Going to Bethune Cookman has given me the opportunity to experience things that I would not have experienced at home. The college life at Cookman is laid back and simple. Mostly every one is friendly and there are people from all over the united states to meet and learn about their home town. I have made many friends and tons of associates. I wouldn't trade going to college for any thing. Am learning a lot My major is Elementary Education and thus far i have been enjoying every little minute of it. I have learn a lot about my major and i can not wait to return to Bethune Cookman to learn even more. Cookman has so many Majors that stand out but to me the Education Department is where to be!
