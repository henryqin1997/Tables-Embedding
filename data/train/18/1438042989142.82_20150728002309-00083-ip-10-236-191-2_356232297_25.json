The adjustment factors were based on age categories, race and Hispanic origin, and gender. The data were collected only for a single year (2010) rather than a typical NHANES 2-year data collection period, therefore, the single year urine sodium weight, WTFIN, should be used in estimating the prevalence and in testing statistical hypotheses using these data. The delete 1 Jackknife method rather than Taylor Series Linearization is recommended for variance estimation (Wolters, 2007). The delete 1 Jackknife method is a replication method, using a design based method for variance estimation. Fifteen delete 1 jackknife replicate weights, WTFIN01-WTFIN15, are provided for variance estimation using the delete 1 Jackknife method. To calculate the nominal degrees of freedom of the estimated variance, unmasked variance units (which differ from the Masked Variance Unit codes provided for the two year public-use files) are provided. These unmasked variance units are needed to determine the critical value for the Student\u2019s t statistic used to construct confidence intervals., 11540=Title: Sodium, potassium, and chloride in casual urine (SSUE10_R ) Contact Number: 1-866-441-NCHS Years of Content: 2010 - 2010 First Published: September, 2012 Revised: NA Access Constraints: RDC Only Use Constraints: RDC Only Geographic Coverage: National Subject:Sodium, potassium, and chloride in casual urine Record Source: NHANES 2010 - 2010 Survey Methodology: NHANES 2010 - 2010 is a stratified multistage probability sample of the civilian non-institutionalized population of the U.S. Medium: NHANES Web site; SAS transport files, 10736=Measurement of sodium, potassium, and chloride in a subset of stored casual urine samples from NHANES 2010.}",
