Because Saccharomyces cerevisiae is sensitive to glyphosate, GAT can also be used as a selectable marker. To demonstrate this, an evolved GAT gene (0\u20146D10), SEQ ID NO:196, is cloned from the T-DNA vector pMAXY3793 (as shown in Example 9) as a PstI-ClaI fragment containing the entire coding region and ligated into PstI-ClaI digested p424TEF (Gene, 1995, 156:119-122) as shown in FIG. 13. This plasmid contains an E. coli origin of replication and a gene conferring carbenicillin resistance as well as a TRP1, tryptophan auxotroph selectable marker for yeast transformation.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{415276=Root-preferred promoters are known and can be selected from the many available from the literature or isolated de novo from various compatible species. See, for example, Hire et al. (1992) Plant Mol. Biol. 20(2):207-218 (soybean root-specific glutamine synthetase gene); Keller et al. (1991) Plant Cell 3(10):1051-1061 (root-specific control element in the GRP 1.8 gene of French bean); Sanger et al. (1990) Plant Mol. Biol. 14(3):433-443 (root-specific promoter of the mannopine synthase (MAS) gene of Agrobacterium tumefaciens); and Miao et al. (1991) Plant Cell 3(1):11-22 (full-length cDNA clone encoding cytosolic glutamine synthetase (GS), which is expressed in roots and root nodules of soybean). See also Bogusz et al. (1990) Plant Cell 2(7):633-641, which discloses two root-specific promoters isolated from hemoglobin genes from the nitrogen-fixing nonlegume Parasponia andersonii and the related non-nitrogen-fixing nonlegume Trema tomentosa. The promoters of these genes were linked to a \u03b2-glucuronidase reporter gene and introduced into both the nonlegume Nicotiana tabacum and the legume Lotus corniculatus, and in both instances root-specific promoter activity was preserved. Leach et al. (1991) describe their analysis of the promoters of the highly expressed rolC and rolD root-inducing genes of Agrobacterium rhizogenes (see Plant Science (Limerick) 79(1):69-76). They concluded that enhancer and tissue-preferred DNA determinants are dissociated in those promoters. Teeri et al. (1989) EMBO J. 8(2):343-350 used gene fusion to lacZ to show that the Agrobacterium T-DNA gene encoding octopine synthase is especially active in the epidermis of the root tip and that the TR2\u2032 gene is root specific in the intact plant and stimulated by wounding in leaf tissue, which is an especially desirable combination of characteristics for use with an insecticidal or larvicidal gene. The TR1\u2032 gene, fused to nptII (neomycin phosphotransferase II), showed similar characteristics. Additional root-preferred promoters include the VfENOD-GRP3 gene promoter (Kuster et al. (1995) Plant Mol. Biol. 29(4):759-772); the ZRP2 promoter (U.S. Pat. No. 5,633,636); the IFS1 promoter (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/104,706) and the rolB promoter (Capana et al.

Preferred regeneration media include media containing MS salts. The plant cells, calli or explant are then typically cultured on rooting medium in a light/dark cycle until shoots and roots develop. Methods for plant regeneration are known in the art and preferred methods are provided by Kamo et al., (Bot. Gaz. 146(3):324-334, 1985); West et al., (The Plant Cell 5:1361-1369, 1993); and Duncan et al. (Planta 165:322-332, 1985)., 27488=Crop selectivity to specific herbicides can be conferred by engineering genes into crops which encode appropriate herbicide metabolizing enzymes. In some cases these enzymes, and the nucleic acids that encode them, originate in a plant. In other cases, they are derived from other organisms, such as microbes. See, e.g., Padgette et al. (1996) \u201cNew weed control opportunities: Development of soybeans with a Round UP Ready\u2122 gene\u201d and Vasil (1996) \u201cPhosphinothricin-resistant crops\u201d, both in Herbicide-Resistant Crops, ed. Duke (CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla.) pp. 54-84 and pp. 85-91. Indeed, transgenic plants have been engineered to express a variety of herbicide tolerance/metabolizing genes, from a variety of organisms. For example, acetohydroxy acid synthase, which has been found to make plants that express this enzyme resistant to multiple types of herbicides, has been introduced into a variety of plants (see, e.g., Hattori et al. (1995) Mol. Gen. Genet. 246: 419). Other genes that confer tolerance to herbicides include: a gene encoding a chimeric protein of rat cytochrome P4507A1 and yeast NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (Shiota et al. (1994) Plant Physiol. 106: 17), genes for glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase (Aono et al. (1995) Plant Cell Physiol. 36: 1687, and genes for various phosphotransferases (Datta et al. (1992) Plant Mol. Biol. 20: 619)., 476697=Native or low activity GAT enzymes typically have a kcat of approximately 1 min\u22121 and a KM for glyphosate of 1.5-10 Mm. KM for acetyl CoA was typically less than 25 \u03bcM., 348883=The result of any of the diversity generating procedures described herein can be the generation of one or more polynucleotides, which can be selected or screened for polynucleotides that encode proteins with or which confer desirable properties. Following diversification by one or more of the methods described herein, or otherwise available to one of skill, any polynucleotides that are produced can be selected for a desired activity or property, e.g. altered Km for glyphosate, altered Km for acetyl CoA, use of alternative cofactors (e.g., propionyl CoA) increased kcat, etc. This can include identifying any activity that can be detected, for example, in an automated or automatable format, by any of the assays in the art. For example, GAT homologs with increased specific activity can be detected by assaying the conversion of glyphosate to N-acetylglyphosate, e.g., by mass spectrometry. Alternatively, improved ability to confer resistance to glyphosate can be assayed by growing bacteria transformed with a nucleic acid of the invention on agar containing increasing concentrations of glyphosate or by spraying transgenic plants incorporating a nucleic acid of the invention with glyphosate. A variety of related (or even unrelated) properties can be evaluated, in serial or in parallel, at the discretion of the practitioner. Additional details regarding recombination and selection for herbicide tolerance can be found, e.g., in \u201cDNA SHUFFLING TO PRODUCE HERBICIDE RESISTANT CROPS\u201d (U.S. Pub. No. 2002/0058249) filed Aug. 12, 1999., 167941=Recombinant methods for producing and isolating GAT polypeptides of the invention are described herein. In addition to recombinant production, the polypeptides may be produced by direct peptide synthesis using solid-phase techniques (e.g., Stewart et al. (1969) Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (WH Freeman Co, San Francisco); and Merrifield (1963) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85: 2149-2154). Peptide synthesis may be performed using manual techniques or by automation. Automated synthesis may be achieved, for example, using Applied Biosystems 431 A Peptide Synthesizer (Perkin Elmer, Foster City, Calif.) in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer. For example, subsequences may be chemically synthesized separately and combined using chemical methods to provide full-length GAT polypeptides. Peptides can also be ordered from a variety of sources., 406310=DNA can also be introduced into plants by direct DNA transfer into pollen as described by Zhou et al. (1983) Methods in Enzymology 101:433; D. Hess (1987) Intern Rev. Cytol. 107:367; and Luo et al. (1988) Plant Mol. Biol. Reporter 6:165. Expression of polypeptide coding nucleic acids can be obtained by injection of the DNA into reproductive organs of a plant as described by Pena et al. (1987) Nature 325:274. DNA can also be injected directly into the cells of immature embryos and the rehydration of desiccated embryos as described by Neuhaus et al. (1987) Theor. Appl. Genet. 75: 30; and Benbrook et al. (1986) in Proceedings Bio Expo 1986, Butterworth, Stoneham, Mass., pp. 27-54., 613498=Soybean plants expressing GAT & HRA, high resistance allele of acetolactate synthase (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,605,011, 5,378,824, 5,141,870, and 5013,659), genes were produced using the methods described in Example 17. The HRA gene was used as selectable marker gene for transformation. The selection agent was chlorsulfuron at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. The selectable marker gene was comprised of the S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthetase (SAMS) promoter from Glycine max (U.S. 2003/226166), HRA coding sequence from Glycine max and acetolactate synthase terminator from Glycine max. The selectable marker gene was either linked to or co-bombarded with a GAT construct consisting of a synthetic constitutive promoter (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,072,050 and 6,555,673) or the maize Histone 2B promoter (U.S. Pat. No. 6,177,611), a GAT variant (18-28D9c (SEQ ID NO:824)) and the Pin II terminator (Gyheung an et al., Plant Cell 1:115:122 (1989)). Transgenic plants were generated as described in Example 17. Levels of glyphosate resistance were determined as described in Example 17 using plant discoloration scores after 2\ufffd or 4\ufffd glyphosate application rates. The results shown in Table 15 demonstrate that different constitutive promoters driving GAT variant (18-28D9c (SEQ ID NO:824)) confer glyphosate resistance in T0 plants., 427904=A variety of other transformation protocols are contemplated in the present invention. Transformation protocols as well as protocols for introducing nucleotide sequences into plants may vary depending on the type of plant or plant cell, i.e., monocot or dicot, targeted for transformation. Suitable methods of introducing nucleotide sequences into plant cells and subsequent insertion into the plant genome include microinjection (Crossway et al. (1986) Biotechniques 4:320-334), electroporation (Riggs et al. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:5602-5606), Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,563,055 and 5,981,840), direct gene transfer (Paszkowski et al. (1984) EMBO J. 3:2717-2722), and ballistic particle acceleration (see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,945,050; U.S. Pat.

(1993) Plant J. 4(3):495-505. Such promoters can be modified, if necessary, for weak expression., 329364=An intron sequence can be added to the 5\u2032 untranslated region of the coding sequence or the partial coding sequence to increase the amount of the mature message that accumulates. See for example Buchman and Berg (1988) Mol. Cell. Biol. 8: 4395-4405 and Callis et al. (1987) Genes Dev. 1: 1183-1200. Use of maize introns Adhl, intron 1, 2, and 6, and the Bronze-1 intron are known in the art. See generally, Freeling and Walbot, eds. (1994) The Maize Handbook (Springer, N.Y.), chapter 116., 372303=Diversity also can be generated in nucleic acids or populations of nucleic acids using a recombinational procedure termed \u201cincremental truncation for the creation of hybrid enzymes\u201d (\u201cITCHY\u201d) described in Ostermeier et al. (1999) \u201cA combinatorial approach to hybrid enzymes independent of DNA homology\u201d Nature Biotech 17:1205. This approach can be used to generate an initial library of variants which can optionally serve as a substrate for one or more in vitro or in vivo recombination methods. See, also, Ostermeier et al. (1999) \u201cCombinatorial Protein Engineering by Incremental Truncation,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 96: 3562-67; and Ostermeier et al. (1999), \u201cIncremental Truncation as a Strategy in the Engineering of Novel Biocatalysts,\u201d Biological and Medicinal Chemistry, 7: 2139-44., 92266=In one aspect, the invention provides a novel family of isolated or recombinant polypeptides referred to herein as \u201cglyphosate-N-acetyltransferase polypeptides\u201d or \u201cGAT polypeptides.\u201d GAT polypeptides are characterized by their structural similarity to a novel family of GATs. Many but not all GAT polypeptides are GATs. The distinction is that GATs are defined in terms of function, whereas GAT polypeptides are defined in terms of structure. A subset of the GAT polypeptides consists of those GAT polypeptides that have GAT activity, preferably at a level that will function to confer glyphosate resistance upon a transgenic plant expressing the protein at an effective level. Some preferred GAT polypeptides for use in conferring glyphosate tolerance have a kcat of at least 1 min\u22121, or more preferably at least 10 min\u22121, 100 min1 or 1000 min1. Other preferred GAT polypeptides for use in conferring glyphosate tolerance have a KM no greater than 100 mM, or more preferably no greater than 10 mM, 1 mM, or 0.1 mM. Still other preferred GAT polypeptides for use in conferring glyphosate tolerance have a kcat/KM of at least 1 mM\u22121 min\u22121 or more, preferably at least 10 mM\u22121 min\u22121, 100 mM\u22121min\u22121, 1000 mM\u22121min\u22121, or 10,000 mM\u22121min\u22121., 478192=Genes coding for GAT enzymes were cloned into E. coli expression vector pQE80 (Qiagen) and introduced into E. coli strain XL1 Blue (Stratagene). Cultures were grown in 150 ul rich medium (LB with 50 ug/ml carbenicllin) in shallow U-bottom 96-well polystyrene plates to late-log phase and diluted 1:9 with fresh medium containing 1 mM IPTG (USB). After 4-8 hours induction, cells were harvested, washed with 5 mM morpholine acetate pH 6.8 and resuspended in an equal volume of the same morpholine buffer. Reactions were carried out with up to 10 ul of washed cells. At higher activity levels, the cells were first diluted up to 1:200 and 5 ul was added to 100 ul reaction mix. To measure GAT activity, the same reaction mix as described for low activity was used. However, for detecting highly active GAT enzymes the glyphosate concentration was reduced to 0.15-0.5 mM, the pH was reduced to 6.8, and reactions were carried out for 1 hour at 37\ufffd C. Reaction workup and MS detection were as described herein., 482614=Using this methodology, kinetic parameters for a number of GAT polypeptides exemplified herein were determined. For example, the kcat, KM and kcat/KM for the GAT polypeptide corresponding to SEQ ID NO:445 have been determined to be 322 min\u22121, 0.5 mM and 660 mM\u22121min\u22121, respectively, using the assay conditions described above. The kcat, KM and kcat/KM for the GAT polypeptide corresponding to SEQ ID NO:457 have been determined to be 118 min\u22121, 0.1 mM and 1184 mM\u22121min\u22121, respectively, using the assay conditions described above. The kcat, KM and kcat/KM for the GAT polypeptide corresponding to SEQ ID NO:300 have been determined to be 296 min\u22121, 0.65 mM and 456 mM\u22121min\u22121, respectively, using the assay conditions described above. One of skill in the art can use these numbers to confirm that a GAT activity assay is generating kinetic parameters for a GAT suitable for comparison with the values given herein. For example, the conditions used to compare the activity of GATs should yield the same kinetic constants for SEQ ID NO: 300, 445, and 457 (within normal experimental variance) as those reported herein, when the conditions are used to compare a test GAT with the GAT polypeptides exemplified herein., 81175=A \u201csignal peptide\u201d is an amino acid sequence which is translated in conjunction with a protein and directs the protein to the secretory system (Chrispeels (1991) Ann. Rev. Plant Phys. Plant Mol. Biol. 42: 21-53). If the protein is to be directed to a vacuole, a vacuolar targeting signal can further be added, or if to the endoplasmic reticulum, an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal may be added. If the protein is to be directed to the nucleus, any signal peptide present should be removed and instead a nuclear localization signal included (Raikhel. (1992) Plant Phys. 100: 1627-1632)., 200737=Polynucleotides and oligonucleotides of the invention can be prepared by standard solid-phase methods, according to known synthetic methods. Typically, fragments of up to about 100 bases are individually synthesized, then joined (e.g., by enzymatic or chemical ligation methods, or polymerase mediated methods) to form essentially any desired continuous sequence. For example, polynucleotides and oligonucleotides of the invention can be prepared by chemical synthesis using, e.g., the classical phosphoramidite method described by Beaucage et al. (1981) Tetrahedron Letters 22:1859-69, or the method described by Matthes et al. (1984) EMBO J. 3: 801-05, e.g., as is typically practiced in automated synthetic methods. According to the phosphoramidite method, oligonucleotides are synthesized, e.g., in an automatic DNA synthesizer, purified, annealed, ligated and cloned in appropriate vectors., 435828=The polynucleotides of the present invention can also be stacked with traits desirable for disease or herbicide resistance (e.g., fumonisin detoxification genes (U.S. Pat. No. 5,792,931); avirulence and disease resistance genes (Jones et al. (1994) Science 266:789; Martin et al. (1993) Science 262:1432; Mindrinos et al. (1994) Cell 78:1089); acetolactate synthase (ALS) mutants that lead to herbicide resistance such as the S4 and/or Hra mutations; inhibitors of glutamine synthase such as phosphinothricin or basta (e.g., bar gene); and glyphosate resistance (EPSPS gene)); and traits desirable for processing or process products such as high oil (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,232,529); modified oils (e.g., fatty acid desaturase genes (U.S. Pat. No. 5,952,544; WO 94/11516)); modified starches (e.g., ADPG pyrophosphorylases (AGPase), starch synthases (SS), starch branching enzymes (SBE), and starch debranching enzymes (SDBE)); and polymers or bioplastics (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,602,321; beta-ketothiolase, polyhydroxybutyrate synthase, and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (Schubert et al. (1988) J. Bacteriol. 170:5837-5847) facilitate expression of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs)); the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. One could also combine the polynucleotides of the present invention with polynucleotides providing agronomic traits such as male sterility (e.g., see U.S. Pat. No. 5,583,210), stalk strength, flowering time, or transformation technology traits such as cell cycle regulation or gene targeting (e.g., WO 99/61619, WO 00/17364, and WO 99/25821); the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference., 366524=In silico methods of recombination can be effected in which genetic algorithms are used in a computer to recombine sequence strings which correspond to homologous (or even non-homologous) nucleic acids. The resulting recombined sequence strings are optionally converted into nucleic acids by synthesis of nucleic acids which correspond to the recombined sequences, e.g., in concert with oligonucleotide synthesis gene reassembly techniques. This approach can generate random, partially random or designed variants. Many details regarding in silico recombination, including the use of genetic algorithms, genetic operators and the like in computer systems, combined with generation of corresponding nucleic acids (and/or proteins), as well as combinations of designed nucleic acids and/or proteins (e.g., based on cross-over site selection) as well as designed, pseudo-random or random recombination methods are described in WO 00/42560 by Selifonov et al., \u201cMethods for Making Character Strings, Polynucleotides and Polypeptides Having Desired Characteristics\u201d and WO 00/42559 by Selifonov and Stemmer \u201cMethods of Populating Data Structures for Use in Evolutionary Simulations.\u201d Extensive details regarding in silico recombination methods are found in these applications. This methodology is generally applicable to the present invention in providing for recombination of nucleic acid sequences and/or gene fusion constructs encoding proteins involved in various metabolic pathways (such as, for example, carotenoid biosynthetic pathways, ectoine biosynthetic pathways, polyhydroxyalkanoate biosynthetic pathways, aromatic polyketide biosynthetic pathways, and the like) in silico and/or the generation of corresponding nucleic acids or proteins., 169693=Methods of producing polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are known to those of skill in the art, and many antibodies are available. See, e.g., Coligan (1991) Current Protocols in Immunology (Wiley/Greene, NY); Harlow and Lane (1989) Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual (Cold Spring Harbor Press, NY); Stites et al. (eds.) Basic and Clinical Immunology, 4th ed. (Lange Medical Publications, Los Altos, Calif.), and references cited therein; Goding (1986) Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, 2d ed. (Academic Press, New York, N.Y.); and Kohler and Milstein (1975) Nature 256: 495-497. Other suitable techniques for antibody preparation include selection of libraries of recombinant antibodies in phage or similar vectors. See, Huse et al. (1989) Science 246: 1275-1281; and Ward et al. (1989) Nature 341: 544-546. Specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies and antisera will usually bind with a KD of at least about 0.1 \u03bcM, preferably at least about 0.01 \u03bcM or better, and most typically and preferably, 0.001 \u03bcM or better., 325360=The promoters used in the present invention can be \u201ctissue-specific\u201d and, as such, under developmental control in that the polynucleotide is expressed only in certain tissues, such as leaves, roots, fruit, flowers and/or seeds. An exemplary promoter is the anther specific promoter 5126 (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,689,049 and 5,689,051). Examples of seed-preferred promoters include, but are not limited to, 27 kD gamma zein promoter and waxy promoter, Boronat et al. 1986) Plant Sci. 47, 95-102; Reina et al. (1990) Nucleic Acids Res. 18 (21): 6426; and Kloesgen et al. (1986) Mol. Gen. Genet. 203: 237-244. Promoters that express in the embryo, pericarp, and endosperm are disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Ser. Nos. 60/097,233 filed Aug. 20, 1998 and 60/098,230 filed Aug. 28, 1998. The disclosures each of these are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In embodiments in which one or more nucleic acid sequences endogenous to the plant system are incorporated into the construct, the endogenous promoters (or variants thereof) from these genes can be employed for directing expression of the genes in the transfected plant. Tissue-specific promoters can also be used to direct expression of heterologous polynucleotides., 26029=This application is a divisional of co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 10/835,615, filed Apr. 29, 2004, which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference herein., 417818=\u201cSeed-preferred\u201d promoters include both \u201cseed-specific\u201d promoters (those promoters active during seed development such as promoters of seed storage proteins) as well as \u201cseed-germinating\u201d promoters (those promoters active during seed germination). See Thompson et al. (1989) BioEssays 10:108, herein incorporated by reference. Such seed-preferred promoters include, but are not limited to, Ciml (cytokinin-induced message); cZ19BI (maize 19 kDa zein); milps (myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase); and celA (cellulose synthase) (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,225,529, herein incorporated by reference). Gamma-zein is an endosperm-specific promoter. Glob-1 is an embryo-specific promoter. For dicots, seed-specific promoters include, but are not limited to, bean \u03b2-phaseolin, napin, \u03b2-conglycinin, soybean lectin, cruciferin, and the like. For monocots, seed-specific promoters include, but are not limited to, maize 15 kDa zein, 22 kDa zein, 27 kDa zein, g-zein, waxy, shrunken 1, shrunken 2, globulin 1, etc. See also WO 00/12733, which discloses seed-preferred promoters from end1 and end2 genes; herein incorporated by reference., 509754=Ratios near 3:1 indicate a single segregating dominant event. Ratios greater than 3:1 indicate several segregating inserts. Ratios less than 3:1 can be due to small sample size effects, incomplete dominance, or position effects that render expression too low to confer herbicide tolerance. Compared to the controls, it was clear that the GAT gene was transmitted to the T1 generation and conferred glyphosate tolerance., 355440=Additional suitable methods include point mismatch repair (Kramer et al. (1984) \u201cPoint Mismatch Repair\u201d Cell 38:879-887), mutagenesis using repair-deficient host strains (Carter et al.

In such cases bulk fermentation procedures are employed. Briefly, a GAT polynucleotide, e.g., a polynucleotide comprising any one of SEQ ID NO: 516, 517, 518, 519, 520, 521, 522, 523, 524, 525, 526, 527, 528, 529, 530, 531, 532, 533, 534, 535, 536, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541, 542, 543, 544, 545, 546, 547, 548, 549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 556, 557, 558, 559, 560, 561, 562, 563, 564, 565, 566, 567, 620, 622, 624, 626, 628, 630, 632, 634, 636, 638, 640, 642, 644, 646, 648, 650, 652, 654, 656, 658, 660, 662, 664, 666, 668, 670, 672, 674, 676, 678, 680, 682, 684, 686, 688, 690, 692, 694, 696, 698, 700, 702, 704, 706, 708, 710, 712, 714, 716, 718, 720, 722, 724, 726, 728, 730, 732, 734, 736, 738, 740, 742, 744, 746, 748, 750, 752, 754, 756, 758, 760, 762, 764, 768, 770, 772, 774, 776, 778, 780, 782, 784, 786, 788, 790, 792, 794, 796, 798, 800, 802, 804, 806, 808, 810, 812, 814, 816, 818, 820, 822, 824, 832, 834, 836, 838, 840, 842, 844, 846, 848, 850, 852, 854, 856, 858, 860, 862, 864, 866, 868, 870, 872, 874, 876, 878, 880, 882, 884, 886, 888, 890, 892, 894, 896, 898, 900, 902, 904, 906, 908, 910, 912, 914, 916, 918, 920, 922, 924, 926, 928, 930, 932, 933, 934, 935, 936, 937, 938, 939, 940, 941, 942, 943, 944, 945, 947, 949, 951, and 952, or other nucleic acids encoding GAT polypeptides of the invention can be cloned into an expression vector. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,955,310 to Widner et al. \u201cMETHODS FOR PRODUCING A POLYPEPTIDE IN A BACILLUS CELL,\u201d describes a vector with tandem promoters, and stabilizing sequences operably linked to a polypeptide encoding sequence. After inserting the polynucleotide of interest into a vector, the vector is transformed into a bacterial, e.g., a Bacillus subtilis strain PL1801IIE (amyE, apr, npr, spoIIE::Tn917) host. The introduction of an expression vector into a Bacillus cell may, for instance, be effected by protoplast transformation (see, e.g., Chang and Cohen (1979) Mol. Gen. Genet. 168:111), by using competent cells (see, e.g., Young and Spizizin (1961) J. Bacteriol. 81:823, or Dubnau and Davidoff-Abelson (1971) J. Mol. Biol. 56: 209), by electroporation (see, e.g., Shigekawa and Dower (1988) Biotechniques 6: 742), or by conjugation (see, e.g., Koehler and Thorne (1987) J. Bacteriol. 169: 5271), see also, Ausubel, Sambrook and Berger, all supra., 610232=A binary vector with a dMMV-gat-UBQ3 cassette in the T-DNA was transformed into competent Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58 cells by electroporation (McCormac et al., Mol. Biotechnol. 9:155-159, 1998). After growth on LB+40 ug/ml kanamycin plates for 2 days at 28\ufffd C., colonies were inoculated into LB+40 ug/ml kanamycin liquid medium and shaken overnight at 28\ufffd C. The Agrobacterium cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000 g for 10 minutes and then resuspended in a volume of 10 mM MgSO4 equivalent to the initial culture volume. This bacterial suspension was forced or \u201cinfiltrated\u201d into the intercellular spaces of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves using a 1 ml plastic syringe (with no needle). By infiltrating 200-300 \u03bcl of bacterial suspension into each spot (typically 3-4 cm2 in infiltrated area), 4 or more spots could be arranged on a single leaf still attached to the plant. In some cases the gat-containing Agrobacterium strain was diluted 5:1 or 10:1 with a second Agrobacterium strain lacking gat prior to infiltration. This dilution step has the effect of reducing the overall expression of the gat gene in the plant cells, thereby preventing saturation and allowing easier visualization of expression differences between variants and constructs. After 3 days the leaf material was ground, extracted in aqueous buffer, and centrifuged. The supernatant, containing the soluble proteins, was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the gel was blotted and probed with an antiGAT polyclonal antibody., 418987=In particular, a strongly or weakly constitutive plant promoter that directs expression of a GAT nucleic acid in all tissues of a plant can be favorably employed. Such promoters are active under most environmental conditions and states of development or cell differentiation. In addition to the promoters mentioned above examples of constitutive promoters include the 1\u2032- or 2\u2032-promoter of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and other transcription initiation regions from various plant genes known to those of skill. Where over expression of a GAT polypeptide of the invention is detrimental to the plant, one of skill will recognize that weak constitutive promoters can be used for low-levels of expression. Generally, by \u201cweak promoter\u201d a promoter that drives expression of a coding sequence at a low level is intended. By \u201clow level\u201d levels from about 1/1000 transcripts to about 1/100,000 transcripts, to about as low as 1/500,000 transcripts per cell are intended. Alternatively, it is recognized that weak promoters also include promoters that are expressed in only a few cells and not in others to give a total low level of expression. Where a promoter is expressed at unacceptably high levels, portions of the promoter sequence can be deleted or modified to decrease expression levels. In those cases where high levels of expression is not harmful to the plant, a strong promoter, e.g., a t-RNA, or other pol III promoter, or a strong pol II promoter, (e.g., the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter, CaMV, 35S promoter) can be used., 541145=Soybean plants expressing GAT variant transgenes were produced using the method of particle gun bombardment (see Klein et al. (1987) Nature 327:70-73) using a DuPont Biolistic PDS1000/He instrument. The selection agent used during the transformation process was hygromycin. Either the hygromycin selectable marker gene remained in the transgenic events or the hygromycin gene was excised by methods known in the art. DNA fragments were prepared with a synthetic constitutive promoter, a GAT variant and PinII terminator. The selectable marker gene, comprising the 35S CaMV promoter, HPT gene and NOS terminator, was cobombarded with the GAT gene variant as described above. Bombarded soybean embryogenic suspension tissue was cultured for one week in the absence of selection agent. Embryogenic suspension tissue was placed in liquid selection medium for 6 weeks. Putative transgenic suspension tissue was sampled for PCR analysis to determine the presence of the GAT gene. Putative transgenic suspension culture tissue was maintained in selection medium for 3 weeks to obtain enough tissue for plant regeneration. Suspension tissue was matured for 4 weeks using standard procedures; matured somatic embryos were desiccated for 4-7 days and then placed on germination induction medium for 2-4 weeks. Germinated plantlets were transferred to soil in cell pack trays for 3 weeks for acclimatization. Plantlets were potted to 10-inch pots in the greenhouse for evaluation of glyphosate resistance., 299929=Nucleic acids which do not hybridize to each other under stringent conditions are still substantially identical if the polypeptides which they encode are substantially identical.

See, Ausbel, Sambrook and Berger, all supra., 463142=Protoporphyrinogen oxidase (protox) is necessary for the production of chlorophyll, which is necessary for all plant survival. The protox enzyme serves as the target for a variety of herbicidal compounds. These herbicides also inhibit growth of all the different species of plants present, causing their total destruction.

For example, the DNA construct may be introduced directly into the genomic DNA of the plant cell using techniques such as electroporation, PEG-mediated transfection, particle bombardment, silicon fiber delivery, or microinjection of plant cell protoplasts or embryogenic callus.

P., and Draper, J., In: DNA Cloning, Vol. II, D. M. Glover, Ed., Oxford, IRI Press, 1985; WO 88/02405 describes the use of A. rhizogenes strain A4 and its Ri plasmid along with A. tumefaciens vectors pARC8 or pARC16); (2) liposome-mediated DNA uptake (see, e.g., Freeman et al. (1984) Plant Cell Physiol. 25:1353; (3) the vortexing method (see, e.g., Kindle (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:1228., 441530=The regeneration of plants containing the foreign gene introduced by Agrobacterium can be achieved as described by Horsch et al., Science, 227:1229-1231 (1985) and Fraley et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 80:4803 (1983). This procedure typically produces shoots within two to four weeks and these transformant shoots are then transferred to an appropriate root-inducing medium containing the selective agent and an antibiotic to prevent bacterial growth. Transgenic plants of the present invention may be fertile or sterile., 364497=Whole genome recombination methods can also be used in which whole genomes of cells or other organisms are recombined, optionally including spiking of the genomic recombination mixtures with desired library components (e.g., genes corresponding to the pathways of the present invention). These methods have many applications, including those in which the identity of a target gene is not known. Details on such methods are found, e.g., in WO 98/31837 by del Cardayre et al. \u201cEvolution of Whole Cells and Organisms by Recursive Sequence Recombination;\u201d and in, e.g., WO 00/04190 by del Cardayre et al., also entitled \u201cEvolution of Whole Cells and Organisms by Recursive Sequence Recombination.\u201d Thus, any of these processes and techniques for recombination, recursive recombination, and whole genome recombination, alone or in combination, can be used to generate the modified nucleic acid sequences and/or modified gene fusion constructs of the present invention., 28955=One herbicide which is the subject of much investigation in this regard is N-phosphonomethylglycine, commonly referred to as glyphosate. Glyphosate is the top selling herbicide in the world, with sales projected to reach $5 billion by 2003. It is a broad spectrum herbicide that kills both broadleaf and grass-type plants. A successful mode of commercial level glyphosate resistance in transgenic plants is by introduction of a modified Agrobacterium CP4 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (hereinafter referred to as EPSP synthase or EPSPS) gene. The transgene is targeted to the chloroplast where it is capable of continuing to synthesize EPSP from phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP) and shikimate-3-phosphate in the presence of glyphosate. In contrast, the native EPSP synthase is inhibited by glyphosate. Without the transgene, plants sprayed with glyphosate quickly die due to inhibition of EPSP synthase which halts the downstream pathway needed for aromatic amino acid, hormone, and vitamin biosynthesis. The CP4 glyphosate-resistant soybean transgenic plants are marketed, e.g., by Monsanto under the name \u201cRound UP Ready\u2122.\u201d, 338889=As noted, many references are available for the culture and production of many cells, including cells of bacterial, plant, animal (especially mammalian) and archebacterial origin.

Using these methods, transgenic seed are produced without the need for tissue culture., 365503=Synthetic recombination methods can also be used, in which oligonucleotides corresponding to targets of interest are synthesized and reassembled in PCR or ligation reactions which include oligonucleotides which correspond to more than one parental nucleic acid, thereby generating new recombined nucleic acids. Oligonucleotides can be made by standard nucleotide addition methods, or can be made, e.g., by tri-nucleotide synthetic approaches. Details regarding such approaches are found in the references noted above, including, e.g., WO 00/42561 by Crameri et al., \u201cOligonucleotide Mediated Nucleic Acid Recombination;\u201d WO 01/23401 by Welch et al., \u201cUse of Codon-Varied Oligonucleotide Synthesis for Synthetic Shuffling;\u201d WO 00/42560 by Selifonov et al., \u201cMethods for Making Character Strings, Polynucleotides and Polypeptides Having Desired Characteristics;\u201d and WO 00/42559 by Selifonov and Stemmer \u201cMethods of Populating Data Structures for Use in Evolutionary Simulations.\u201d}",
