            "Description",
            "Evaporation Cooled Lamp - LED or other lamps that remove heat using evaporation of water or other coolant inside a lamp enclosure structure such as a glass bulb typically without the use of external heat sinks or fins. Optionally, the pressure inside the enclosure can be reduced to lower the boiling point of the coolant. One or more LEDs or other light source can be mounted on a support structure that conducts heat to an evaporation surface. A coolant, preferably water or alcohol (or a water/alcohol mixture), is included inside the structure and can be optionally wicked to the evaporation surface. Vaporized coolant condenses on the inside surface of the enclosure or bulb transferring heat to the ambient through the enclosure. The condensed liquid coolant can return to a pool in the bottom of the enclosure.",
            "Vapor Lamp Assembly Technique and Power Supply - An LED lamp that couples a heatsink with LEDs mounted on it to a glass envelope with a surface area equivalent to approximately that of a conventional light bulb, and by using a coolant vapor within the glass envelop, the lamp can be made much lighter and more cheaply. The heat generated by the LEDs is dissipated by the glass surface and not conducted into the heatsink. The heatsink can thus be mostly for the power supply. This allows for a reduced operating temperature for the power supply components that allows for a longer expected life for the power supply. In addition, the LED light bulb of the present invention can have nearly the same shape and appearance as a standard incandescent bulb. The invention can also have an advanced flyback power supply."

    "textBeforeTable": "Dale Fiene, Algonquin, IL US 02-12-2009 CELLULAR HOME SECURITY SYSTEM - The invention provides an improved security system comprised of video cameras and microphones to remotely monitor a home using a cellular telephone. An activation button is mounted as a doorbell button and interconnected with the security system to trigger the audio and video transmissions. The security system will automatically call the homeowner and allow two-way conversation and video using a streaming transmission. In response to a wireless distress signal sent to the security system using the homeowner's cellular telephone establishes a wireless connection with the security system and a security service or local authorities allowing the third-party to monitor and assess the situation. The homeowner is contemporaneously receiving the audio and video signals from the home using his cellular telephone and is capable of communicating directly with the security service. The distress signal is a secret code consisting of an array of numbers. 20090042604 Published Description Patent application number Dale Ficquette, Oviedo, FL US 01-14-2010 Acoustic Beverage Mixer - A method and device for mixing beverages and dissolving solids comprising a casing with at least one opening for positioning a beverage container, a signal generator housed within said casing, for generating electrical signals, at least one transducer housed within said casing and coupled with said signal generator, for producing mechanical vibrations from a signal generated by said signal generator, wherein said mechanical vibrations vibrate",

In such devices, output signals on the reset pin are decoded by reset reason decode logic circuitry. The output of the reset reason decode logic can be provided to another device or processor, which generates a readily recognizable output signal indicative of a reason why the processor reset. Output signals that can indicate why a processor was reset can include a high or low state of different durations, serial bit streams or a number of pulses, each of which correspond to and therefore identify a reason why the processor was reset. 08-16-2012 Dale J. Freeman, Edwards, NY US Patent application number Description Published 20080307659 CAN OPENER - A cylindrical can that contains both solids and a liquid has a vertical longitudinal axis, circular sides, a horizontal circular lid and bottom, and a rim around the periphery of the lid that extends beyond the sides. The can is opened and the liquid is separated from the solids in the can by a can opener that has a can holder, an arm, a head, a screw, and at least one cutter. The can holder has an opening that has a diameter greater than the diameter of the sides and lesser than the diameter of the rim, so that",
