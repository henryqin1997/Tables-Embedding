The guidance is intended to help ensure that institutions pursuing a significant commercial real estate lending strategy remain healthy and profitable while continuing to serve the credit needs of their communities. The agencies are concerned that rising commercial real estate loan concentrations may expose institutions to unanticipated earnings and capital volatility in the event of adverse changes in commercial real estate markets. The guidance reinforces and enhances existing regulations and guidelines for safe and sound real estate lending. The guidance provides supervisory criteria, including numerical indicators to assist in identifying institutions with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny. The guidance does not limit banks\u0092 commercial real estate lending, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations. The lending and risk management practices will be taken into account in supervisory evaluation of capital adequacy. Our commercial real estate portfolio at December\u00a031, 2007 meets the definition of commercial real estate concentration as set forth in the final guidelines. If our risk management practices are found to be deficient, it could result in increased reserves and capital costs., 348882=in any country.

As a financial holding company, we are required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB before acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of a bank or bank holding company. The FRB will not approve any acquisition, merger or consolidation that would result in substantial anti-competitive effects, unless the anti-competitive effects of the proposed transaction are outweighed by a greater public interest in meeting the needs and convenience of the public. In reviewing applications for such transactions, the FRB also considers managerial, financial, capital and other factors, including the record of performance of the applicant and the bank or banks to be acquired under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (the \u0093CRA\u0094). See \u0093\u0097 The Bank \u0097 Community Reinvestment Act\u0094 below., 431665=At December\u00a031, 2007, goodwill represented approximately 1.8% of our total assets.

Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.\u00a0142, \u0093Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\u0094 we must test our goodwill and, 376058=ACMG and Wagner are registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary duties, recordkeeping requirements, operational requirements and disclosure obligations. Virtually all aspects of ACMG\u0092s and Wagner\u0092s investment management business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict them from carrying on its investment management business in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. In such event, the possible sanctions which may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, business limitations on engaging in the investment management business for specified periods of time, the revocation of any such company\u0092s registration as an investment adviser, and other censures or fines., 451460=2010, 202069=Documents incorporated by reference: Portions of the registrant\u0092s proxy statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the registrant\u0092s 2008 annual meeting of shareholders are incorporated by reference into Part\u00a0III of this Form\u00a010-K., 461042=2727 W. Frye Rd., Ste. 100, Chandler, AZ 85224, 235118=Our banking products are complemented by our fee-based business lines, which we first introduced in 1998 when we began offering trust and estate administration services. Through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions, our fee-based business lines have grown to include employee benefits brokerage and consulting, insurance brokerage, wealth transfer planning, investment banking and investment management services. We believe offering such complementary products allows us to both broaden our relationships with existing customers and attract new customers to our core business. In addition, we believe the fees generated by these services will increase our noninterest income and decrease our dependency on net interest income., 749227=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our commercial banking franchise had strong growth in both net income and earnings per share during 2007 as compared to 2006. Our loan portfolio, the largest interest-earning asset base of the Company, increased 20% in 2007. The increase was driven primarily by our Colorado operations which grew loans by $160.8 million, or 16%, over 2006. Our Arizona operations also had strong loan growth of $141.1 million, or 25%, over 2006., 238851=On April\u00a014, 2003, we acquired Financial Designs Ltd. (\u0093FDL\u0094), a provider of wealth transfer and employee benefit services based in Denver, Colorado. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and accordingly, the results of FDL\u0092s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of purchase. The acquisition of FDL was completed through a merger of FDL into CoBiz Connect,\u00a0Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of CoBiz that has provided employee benefits consulting services since 2000. The surviving corporation continues to use the FDL name., 345035=General. The Bank is a state-chartered banking institution, the deposits of which are insured by the Bank Insurance Fund of the FDIC, and is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Colorado Division of Banking, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. Prior to 2007, the Bank was a nationally chartered institution and also subject to the supervision of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u0093OCC\u0094). Pursuant to such regulations, the Bank is subject to special restrictions, supervisory requirements and potential enforcement actions. The FRB\u0092s supervisory authority over CoBiz can also affect the Bank., 869905=Our continued penetration into the Arizona market and the addition of new senior-level bankers in both Colorado and Arizona have allowed our loan portfolio (net) to increase by $299.7 million in 2007 and $210.8 million in 2006. The overall growth in the loan portfolio during 2007 and 2006 was comprised primarily of $191.9 million and $158.7 million in real estate loans (mortgage and construction), respectively, and $94.6 million and $60.8 million in commercial loans, respectively., 944281=In August\u00a02007, we formed a Real Estate Capital Markets Group. The group will develop a comprehensive capital markets product offering and platform for the Bank\u0092s real estate customers, to include mezzanine debt and other financings, and will also establish a loan syndications desk enabling the Bank to expand into larger loan transactions and more effectively and efficiently manage its capital base., 759036=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our corporate name was changed to CoBiz Financial Inc. at our annual meeting in May\u00a0and the new brand has been introduced to each of our subsidiaries. While the cost of the branding effort increased operating expense in 2007, the unified presentation of our business will create synergies and cross-sell opportunities that will far outweigh any short-term costs., 568139=2005, 187762=Registrant\u0092s telephone number, including area code:\u00a0 (303) 293-2265, 700668=Company Overview. From December\u00a031, 1995, the first complete fiscal year under the current management team, to December\u00a031, 2007, our organization has grown from a bank holding company with two bank locations and total assets of $160.4 million to a diversified financial services holding company with 19 bank locations, six fee-based businesses and total assets of $2.4 billion. Certain key metrics of our operating segments at December\u00a031, 2007 and 2006 are as follows:, 282847=Establish strong brand awareness.\u00a0 In late 2005, we began work to clarify and strengthen the CoBiz brand, focusing on the relationship between each of our business lines, our unique breadth of services and our exceptional reputation in the markets we serve. The project analysis, which was completed in 2006, included extensive customer and market research to help develop a cohesive and comprehensive approach to our internal and external communications efforts while leveraging the power of each subsidiary as part of the larger company. The branding initiative was executed across all our companies throughout 2007. We are very pleased with the results that have refined the brand platform and unified the look and feel of the CoBiz identity across the Company., 452620=2011, 377329=Green, Manning\u00a0& Bunch, Ltd. (\u0093GMB\u0094), our investment banking subsidiary, is registered as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act and is subject to regulation by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u0093FINRA\u0094). GMB is subject to the SEC\u0092s net capital rule\u00a0designed to enforce minimum standards regarding the general financial condition and liquidity of a broker-dealer. Under certain circumstances, this rule\u00a0limits the ability of the Company to make withdrawals of capital and receive dividends from GMB. GMB\u0092s regulatory net capital consistently exceeded such minimum net capital requirements in fiscal 2007. The securities industry is one of the most highly regulated in the United States, and failure to comply with related laws and regulations can result in the revocation of broker-dealer licenses, the imposition of censures or fines, and the suspension or expulsion from the securities business of a firm, its officers or employees., 687745=1392.30, 200682=The aggregate market value of the voting common equity held by non-affiliates of the registrant at June\u00a030, 2007, computed by reference to the closing price on the NASDAQ Global Select Market was $358,736,426.\u00a0 Shares of voting stock held by each officer and director and by each person who owns 5% or more of the outstanding voting stock (as publicly reported by such persons pursuant to Section\u00a013 and Section\u00a016 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) have been excluded in that such persons may be deemed to be affiliates. This determination of affiliate status is not necessarily a conclusive determination for other purposes., 427576=Section\u00a0404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting at the end of each year, and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in all annual reports., 798879=rather than at a later date when the amount of the consideration may be resolved beyond a reasonable doubt. This revised approach replaces SFAS 141\u0092s cost allocation process in which the cost of an acquisition was allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair value. SFAS 141R requires any acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs to be expensed as incurred as opposed to allocating such costs to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as previously required by SFAS 141. Under SFAS 141R, an acquirer recognizes liabilities for a restructuring plan in purchase accounting only if the requirements of SFAS\u00a0146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, are met. SFAS 141R allows for the recognition of pre-acquisition contingencies at fair value only if these contingencies are likely to materialize. If this criterion is not met at the acquisition date, then the acquirer accounts for the non-contractual contingency in accordance with recognition criteria set forth under SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, in which case nothing should be recognized in purchase accounting. SFAS 141R is effective as of the beginning of an entity\u0092s first fiscal year that begins after December\u00a015, 2008. The Company will evaluate the impact\u00a0 SFAS\u00a0141R will have on its consolidated financial statements if an acquisition occurs., 279249=Our core banking franchise and six fee-based businesses, have a large customer base of commercial and high-net-worth individuals with very similar profiles. To facilitate organic growth and cross-referrals between our business lines, we created CoBiz Advisors in 2006 to focus on bringing a concentration of knowledge about each business line to a designated function. The mission of CoBiz Advisors is to unify our company for the benefit of clients and shareholders by serving as an additional resource for internal and external customers in delivering the full suite of the Company\u0092s products and services., 698714=Industry Overview. The U.S. commercial banking industry was significantly impacted in 2007 by increased concerns about the credit quality of mortgages and investment securities collateralized by real estate. As the housing market deteriorated during 2007, losses on subprime mortgages increased and the subprime mortgage market was essentially shutdown. The combination of the real estate downturn and subprime losses led to an overall tightening in the credit market. The Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices conducted by the Federal Reserve Board found that one-third of domestic banks had tightened their lending standards on commercial and industrial (\u0093C&I\u0094) loans during the fourth quarter of 2007. In addition, 80% of domestic banks had tightened their lending standards on commercial real estate loans during the fourth quarter. During this period, loan loss provisions at FDIC-insured institutions reached a 20-year high and quarterly earnings for the industry fell below $30 billion for the first time since 2003. The overall market conditions led the Federal Open Markets Committee (\u0093FOMC\u0094) to reduce the target federal funds rate by 100 basis points in the last four months of 2007, the first decrease since 2003.\u00a0 The FOMC continued this strategy in January\u00a02008, when the target federal funds rate was decreased by 125 basis points within a one week period.\u00a0 While the Company does not originate or purchase subprime loans, nearly all financial service organizations have been impacted by the current environment., 759869=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On July\u00a019, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to 5% of our outstanding stock. The program concluded on November\u00a019, 2007, when all authorized shares had been repurchased. The shares were repurchased at a weighted average price of $16.72 and a total cost of $20.1 million., 566937=2007, 530976=Russell 2000 Index, 449622=P.O. Box 2826 Northstar Center, Edwards, CO 81632, 481553=No matter was submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007., 941820=Real Estate Mortgage Loans. Real estate mortgage loans include various types of loans for which we hold real property as collateral. We generally restrict commercial real estate lending activity to owner-occupied properties or to investor properties that are owned by customers with which we have a current banking relationship. We make commercial real estate loans at both fixed and floating interest rates, with maturities generally ranging from five to 20 years. The Bank\u0092s underwriting standards generally require that a commercial real estate loan not exceed 75% of the appraised value of the property securing the loan. In addition, we originate Small Business Administration 504 loans (\u0093SBA\u0094) on owner-occupied properties with maturities of up to 25 years in which the SBA allows for financing of up to 90% of the project cost and takes a security position that is subordinated to us, as well as US Department of Agriculture (\u0093USDA\u0094) Rural Development loans. At December\u00a031, 2007, approximately 1% of our outstanding loans were guaranteed by the SBA and 1% were guaranteed by the USDA. We also originate residential mortgage loans on a limited basis as an accommodation to our preferred customers., 236535=On April\u00a01, 2003, we acquired Alexander Capital Management Group,\u00a0Inc., an investment advisory firm based in Denver, Colorado, that is registered with the United States Securities and Exchange \u00a0Commission (\u0093SEC\u0094). The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and, 430090=Although management has determined that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective at December\u00a031, 2007, we cannot assure you that we will not identify a material weakness in our internal controls in the future.\u00a0 A material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting would require management and our independent registered public accounting firm to evaluate our internal controls as ineffective.\u00a0 If our internal controls over financial reporting are not considered adequate, we may experience a loss of public confidence, which could have an adverse effect on our business and our stock price., 437918=At December\u00a031, 2007, we had 12 bank locations, six fee-based locations and an operations center in Colorado and seven bank locations in Arizona. Our executive offices are located at 821 17th Street, Denver, Colorado, 80202. We lease our executive offices, our Northeast office and our Surprise office locations from entities partly owned or controlled by a director of the Company. See \u0093Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence\u0094 under Item 13 of Part\u00a0III. The terms of these leases expire between 2013 and 2017. The Company leases all of its facilities. The following table sets forth specific information on each location., 753384=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investment Banking contributed $0.01 per diluted share in 2007, down from $0.02 in 2006. Investment banking revenues are transactional in nature and, as a result, the segment\u0092s earnings can be more volatile. While not a significant source of the Company\u0092s earnings, the segment has been a positive contributor over the last several years., 469218=2017, 459055=2013, 756568=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Corporate Support and Other had an increase in its net loss and loss per share, primarily due to an increase in interest rates that increased our interest expense on our variable-rate junior subordinated debentures and an increase in salaries and employee benefits. In addition, the segment entered into a new revolving line-of-credit during 2007 that increased interest expense over 2006., 245204=Beginning in 2007, the Colorado and Arizona business banking markets have been disclosed together as the Commercial Banking segment. These segments, excluding Corporate Support and Other, consist of various products and activities that are set forth in the following chart:, 792052=On January\u00a01, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No.\u00a048, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes \u0097 an Interpretation of SFAS No.\u00a0109 (\u0093FIN 48\u0094). FIN\u00a048 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements., 750122=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The provision for loan losses increased to $3.9 million in 2007 from $1.3 million in 2006, a $2.6 million increase. Net charge-offs during 2007 increased to $1.8 million compared to net recoveries of $0.2 million in 2006, a $2.0 million increase., 550519=September 1 - 30, 2007, 179673=o\u00a0\u00a0Transition Report Pursuant to Section\u00a013 or 15(d)\u00a0of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934., 793706=In September\u00a02006, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No.\u00a006-4, Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements. The consensus, which has been ratified by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, requires companies to recognize an obligation for the future post-retirement benefits provided to employees in the form of death benefits to be paid to their beneficiaries through split-dollar polices carried in Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI). EITF Issue No.\u00a006-4 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December\u00a015, 2007. The effects of applying EITF Issue No.\u00a006-4 are to be recognized through either (a)\u00a0a change in accounting principle through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption, or (b)\u00a0a change in accounting principle through retrospective application to all prior periods. Upon adoption in January\u00a02008, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of approximately $16,000, net of income tax, to retained earnings to recognize an obligation for post-retirement benefits related to endorsement split-dollar arrangements., 239803=2007 Acquisition, 398927=In 2007, there has been a downturn in the real estate market, a slow-down in construction and an oversupply of real estate for sale.\u00a0 This downturn, and any additional softening, in our real estate markets could hurt our business because a majority of our loans are secured by real estate. Real estate values and real estate markets are generally affected by changes in national, regional or local economic conditions, fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers, changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes, regulations and policies and acts of nature.\u00a0 If real estate prices decline, the value of real estate collateral securing our loans could be reduced.\u00a0 Our ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished, and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans. At December\u00a031, 2007, approximately 70% of the book value of our loan portfolio consisted of loans collateralized by various types of real estate, with 41% of the total in Arizona. Substantially all of our real property collateral is located in Arizona and Colorado. Any such downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows., 475027=2009, 751783=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In April\u00a02007, the Bank converted from a national bank to a state bank. The change in charter is expected to reduce the dollar amount of certain regulatory assessments and will help offset the increase in the FDIC assessment rates., 466144=1620 W. Fountainhead Parkway, Ste. 119, Tempe, AZ 85282, 368765=Pursuant to the FDICIA, regulations have been adopted defining five capital levels: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Increasingly severe restrictions are placed on a depository institution as its capital level classification declines. An institution is critically undercapitalized if it has a tangible equity to total assets ratio less than or equal to 2%. An institution is adequately capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio less than 10%, but greater than or equal to 8%; or a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio less than 6%, but greater than or equal to 4%; or a leverage ratio less than 5%, but greater than or equal to 4% (3% in certain circumstances). An institution is well capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5% or greater; and the institution is not subject to an order, written agreement, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. Under these regulations, at December\u00a031, 2007, the Bank was well capitalized, which places no significant restrictions on the Bank\u0092s activities., 523572=12/31/2005, 318786=General. CoBiz is a financial holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the \u0093BHCA\u0094), and is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the \u0093FRB\u0094). CoBiz is required to file an annual report with the FRB and such other reports as may be required pursuant to the BHCA., 524786=12/31/2007, 789009=On January\u00a01, 2007, the Company adopted SFAS No.\u00a0156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets \u0097 an amendment of FASB Statement No.\u00a0140 (\u0093SFAS 156\u0094). SFAS\u00a0156 requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset or servicing liability each time it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into certain servicing contracts. The Statement also requires all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be initially measured at fair value, if practicable. SFAS 156 permits an entity to choose between the amortization and fair value methods for subsequent measurements. At initial adoption, the Statement permits a one-time reclassification of available for sale securities to trading securities by entities with recognized servicing rights. SFAS 156 also requires separate presentation of servicing assets and servicing liabilities subsequently measured at fair value in the statement of financial position and additional disclosures for all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. The adoption of SFAS 156 did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements., 269534=The following table details the percentage of deposits held by the Company in Arizona and Colorado, as well as other banks headquartered in our market areas and out-of-state banks as reported by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u0093FDIC\u0094) at June\u00a030, 2007., 443848=2008, 758265=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company began the process of selling additional common stock through a secondary offering that subsequently closed on January\u00a024, 2007. The Company sold 975,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $20.90., 522358=12/31/2003, 519196=The following table compares the cumulative total return on a hypothetical investment of $100 in CoBiz common stock on December\u00a031, 2002 and the closing prices on December\u00a031, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, with the hypothetical cumulative total return on the Russell 2000 Index and the Nasdaq Bank Index for the comparable period., 299026=Colorado.\u00a0 Denver\u0092s economy has diversified over the years with significant representation in technology, communications, manufacturing, tourism, transportation, aerospace, biomedical and financial services. The Denver metropolitan area is one of the fastest growing regions in the nation, helping to make Colorado the eighth-fastest growing state in the United States in terms of percentage population growth from July\u00a02005-2006 and again from July\u00a02006-2007. Colorado\u0092s population growth is projected to increase 35% to 5.8 million from 2000 to 2030. The population of the seven-county Denver metropolitan region has grown to approximately 2.6 million with a workforce of over 1.5 million at December\u00a02007. The region\u0092s population growth rate has consistently outpaced the nation\u0092s rate every decade since the 1950s. The state\u0092s unemployment rate at December\u00a02007 was 4.5%, up from a Colorado five-year low of 3.9% in 2006, but below the 2007 national average of 5.0%., 477213=1099 18th St., Ste. 2810, Denver, CO 80202, 346857=USA Patriot Act of 2001. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the \u0093USA Patriot Act\u0094) is intended to allow the federal government to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money-laundering requirements. Among its provisions, the USA Patriot Act requires each financial institution to: (i)\u00a0establish an anti-money-laundering program; (ii)\u00a0establish due diligence policies, procedures and controls with respect to its private banking accounts and correspondent banking accounts involving foreign individuals and certain foreign banks; and (iii)\u00a0avoid establishing, maintaining, administering or managing correspondent accounts in the United States for, or on behalf of, a foreign bank that does not have a physical presence, 280109=De novo branching. We also intend to continue exploring growth opportunities to expand through de novo branching in areas with high concentrations of our target customers in Colorado, Arizona and other western states. This strategy has been successful in Colorado and is being implemented in the Arizona market. Since the acquisition of the Company by private investors in 1994, we have introduced nine Colorado and five Arizona de novo locations. Management has identified Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon as markets of interest and will continue to monitor opportunities for expansion in these areas., 555611=November 1 - 30, 2007, 201642=The number of shares outstanding of the registrant\u0092s sole class of common stock on March\u00a06, 2008, was 23,022,662., 232828=CoBiz Financial Inc. (\u0093CoBiz\u0094 or the \u0093Company\u0094) is a diversified financial holding company headquartered in Denver, Colorado. Through our subsidiary companies, we combine elements of personalized service found in community banks with sophisticated financial products and services traditionally offered by larger regional banks that we market to our targeted customer base of professionals, high-net-worth individuals and small to mid-sized businesses. At December\u00a031, 2007, we had total assets of $2.4 billion, net loans of $1.8 billion and deposits of $1.7 billion. We were incorporated in Colorado on February\u00a019, 1980, as Equitable Bancorporation,\u00a0Inc. Prior to its initial public offering in June\u00a01998, the Company was acquired by a group of private investors in September\u00a01994 who are still current shareholders., 352830=Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Act, which became effective on April\u00a01, 2003, addresses the application of Sections 23A and 23B to credit exposure arising out of derivative transactions between an insured institution and its affiliates and intra-day extensions of credit by an insured depository institution to its affiliates. The rule\u00a0requires institutions to adopt policies and procedures reasonably designed to monitor, manage and control credit exposures arising out of transactions and to clarify that the transactions are subject to Section\u00a023B of the Federal Reserve Act., 319494=Securities Exchange Act of 1934. CoBiz has a class of securities registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u0093Exchange Act\u0094). The Exchange Act requires the Company to file periodic reports with the SEC, governs the Company\u0092s disclosure in proxy solicitations and regulates insider trading transactions., 241162=2008 Acquisition, 477680=2012, 795195=In September\u00a02006, the FASB issued SFAS No.\u00a0157, Fair Value Measurement. FASB Statement No.\u00a0157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November\u00a015, 2007, and interim periods within those years. In February\u00a02008, the FASB delayed the effective date of SFAS No.\u00a0157 for all nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until fiscal years beginning after November\u00a015, 2008.\u00a0 The Company is evaluating the impact SFAS No.\u00a0157 will have on its consolidated financial statements., 797347=In December\u00a02007, the FASB issued SFAS No.\u00a0141, Business Combinations: (Revised 2007) (\u0093SFAS 141R\u0094). SFAS 141R is relevant to all transactions or events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses.\u00a0 SFAS 141R requires an acquirer to recognize any assets and non-controlling interest acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at fair value as of the acquisition date. Liabilities related to contingent consideration are recognized and measured at fair value on the date of acquisition, 870728=Under federal law, the aggregate amount of loans we can make to one borrower is generally limited to 15% of our unimpaired capital, surplus, undivided profits and allowance for loan losses. At December\u00a031, 2007, our individual legal lending limit was $36.3 million. Our Board of Directors has established an internal lending limit of $15.0 million for normal credit extensions and $20.0 million for the highest rated credit types. To accommodate customers whose financing needs exceed our internal lending limits and to address portfolio concentration concerns, we sell loan participations to outside participants. At December\u00a031, 2007 and 2006, the outstanding balances of loan participations sold by us were $49.2 million and $53.3 million, respectively. At December\u00a031, 2007 and 2006, we had loan participations purchased from other banks totaling $31.3 million and $37.3 million, respectively. We use the same analysis in deciding whether or not to purchase a participation in a loan as we would in deciding whether to originate the same loan., 316236=At December\u00a031, 2007, we had 507 employees, including 490 full-time equivalent employees. Employees of the Company enjoy a variety of employee benefit programs, including: stock option plans; an employee stock purchase plan; a 401(k)\u00a0plan; various comprehensive medical, accident and group life insurance plans; and paid vacations. No Company employee is covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we believe our relationship with our employees to be excellent., 752485=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In August\u00a02007, the Bank announced the formation of a Real Estate Capital Markets Group. The group will develop a comprehensive capital markets product offering and platform for the Bank\u0092s real estate customers, to include mezzanine debt and other financings, and will also establish a loan syndications desk enabling the Bank to expand into larger loan transactions and more effectively and efficiently manage its capital base., 468684=2600 N. Central Ave., Phoenix, AZ 85012, 328845=At\u00a0December\u00a031,\u00a02007, 372911=Deposit Insurance Premiums. Under current regulations, FDIC-insured depository institutions that are members of the FDIC pay insurance premiums at rates based on their assessment risk classification, which is determined, in part, based on the institution\u0092s capital ratios and on factors that the FDIC deems relevant to determine the risk of loss to the FDIC. Beginning in 2007, annual assessment rates range from $0.05 to $0.43 per $100, an increase from the $0.00-$0.27 rates that had been in effect since 1996. The amount an institution is assessed is based upon statutory factors that include the balance of insured deposits as well as the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund and may be reviewed semi-annually. Additionally, all institutions insured by the FDIC Bank Insurance Fund are assessed fees to cover the debt of the Financing Corporation, the successor of the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation., 292675=Maintaining asset quality and controlling interest rate risk. We seek to maintain asset quality through a program that includes regular reviews of loans by responsible loan officers and ongoing monitoring of the loan portfolio by a loan review department that reports to the Chief Operations Officer of the Bank but submits reports directly to the audit committee of our Board of Directors. At December\u00a031, 2007, our ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.18%, compared to 0.09% at December\u00a031, 2006., 460220=2014, 467863=2016, 540825=On July\u00a019, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to reacquire up to 5% of the Company\u0092s then outstanding shares of common stock, equating to a maximum of 1,200,207 shares. The July\u00a019, 2007 plan, the only plan authorized by the Board of Directors, concluded on November, 19, 2007, when all authorized shares had been repurchased. Information concerning the activity of the program during the year ended December\u00a031, 2007 is set forth in the following table:, 545195=July 1 - 31, 2007, 762717=Fee-Based Business Lines. The company\u0092s fee-based business lines \u0096 investment banking, insurance, and investment advisory and trust \u0096 operated at a slight loss for 2007 on a combined basis. However, before parent company management fees, central service allocations and amortization, all the fee based companies generated positive cash flow.\u00a0 Our ratio of noninterest income to total operating revenues was 25% for 2007 compared to 27% in 2006. This is in line with the Company\u0092s ongoing target of 25%., 553214=October 1 - 31, 2007, 754228=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investment Advisory and Trust, while a less significant part of our overall operations, continues to recognize increases in revenue production and growth in assets under management. During 2007, the Company was successful in recruiting an experienced management team from a local competitor to lead the Company\u0092s Trust function. While the short-term impact of the recruitment has caused the segment\u0092s operational results to decrease, the long-term prospects of the segment has been enhanced.\u00a0 In addition, on December\u00a031, 2007, the Company acquired Wagner, an investment advisor providing investment management services for high-net-worth individuals and families, foundations and non-profit organizations to complement the segment., 281068=Fee-based business lines. We began offering trust and estate administration services in 1998; employee benefits brokerage and consulting in 2000; property\u00a0& casualty (\u0093P&C\u0094) insurance brokerage and investment banking services in 2001; and high-end life insurance, wealth transfer planning and investment management services in 2003. We believe offering such complementary products allows us to both broaden our relationships with existing customers and attract new customers to our core business. In addition, we believe the fees generated by these services will increase our noninterest income and decrease our dependency on net interest income. In 2005, we expanded our P&C line in Arizona through the addition of an experienced producer familiar with the market. Additionally, on January\u00a02, 2008, the Company acquired the assets of Bernard, Dietrich\u00a0& Associates, a well respected Phoenix-based P&C insurance broker to continue the expansion of this business in the Arizona market. BDA will become CoBiz Insurance, Arizona, an operating division of CoBiz Insurance Inc. and the operating results of BDA will be included within the Insurance segment beginning in the first quarter of 2008. The addition of Wagner to CoBiz\u0092s investment management offerings will expand our reach in the Colorado market and we are also exploring the expansion of our investment management presence in Arizona., 483893=The Common Stock of the Company is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \u0093COBZ.\u0094\u00a0 At March\u00a03, 2008, there were approximately 466 shareholders of record of CoBiz Common Stock., 306292=Arizona. Arizona\u0092s primary economic sectors include trade, manufacturing, mining, agriculture, construction, tourism and services, which is the largest economic sector. Arizona consistently had one of the highest population growth rates in the nation during the latter half of the twentieth century, including being one of the fastest growing states in terms of percentage population growth from July\u00a02006 to July\u00a02007, second only to Nevada. This population growth has been the primary driver behind the Arizona economy. Our banks are located in Maricopa County, which is the nation\u0092s fourth-largest county in terms of population size. Approximately 61% of Arizona\u0092s population, or 3.8 million, reside in Maricopa County, with a workforce of 2.1 million. Through December\u00a02007, the greater Phoenix area saw a 1.3% growth rate in its nonfarm employment base from December\u00a02006, down from a remarkable 5.3% growth a year earlier. The December\u00a02007 unemployment rate for the Phoenix metropolitan area was 3.9%, significantly lower than the U.S. average of 5.0%. The state of Arizona\u0092s population growth is projected to increase by 109% from the year 2000 to the year 2030. The following is selected additional market data regarding the Arizona markets we serve:, 568740=2004, 445839=2550 N. Broadway, Boulder, CO 80302, 796239=In February\u00a02007, the FASB issued SFAS No.\u00a0159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities \u0097 Including an amendment of FASB Statement No.\u00a0115 (\u0093SFAS\u00a0159\u0094). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at specified election dates. For financial instruments elected to be accounted for at fair value, an entity will report the unrealized gains and losses in earnings. This Statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity\u0092s first fiscal year that begins after November\u00a015, 2007. The effect of the first remeasurement to fair value is to be recognized as a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, SFAS 159 will have on its consolidated financial statements., 455173=2012, 321371=Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended (the \u00931994 Act\u0094). The 1994 Act displaces state laws governing interstate bank acquisitions. Under the 1994 Act, a financial or bank holding company may, subject to some limitations, acquire a bank outside of its home state without, 802243=The acquisition of Wagner was accounted for as a purchase and the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity are included in the Company\u0092s balance sheet at December\u00a031, 2007., 688683=1056.44, 791137=On January\u00a01, 2007, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (\u0093EITF\u0094)\u00a006-5, Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance \u0097 Determining the Amount That Could be Realized in Accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin No.\u00a085-4, Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance (\u0093EITF 06-5\u0094). EITF 06-5, addresses various issues in determining the amount that could be realized under an insurance contract. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of approximately $134,000 that was charged to retained earnings to reduce the amount that can be realized on insurance contracts., 567538=2006, 761316=Bank. The commercial bank segment, the cornerstone of our franchise, had continued success in 2007 growing the balance sheet and earnings. Loans grew by 20%, deposit and customer repurchase agreements grew by 12%, and earnings grew by 10%. The growth of the Bank was encouraging considering 2007 was a challenging year for the Bank and the industry as we faced increased competition and narrowing spreads between our interest-bearing assets and our cost of funds. While loan demand continued to grow in the double digits, lower-cost deposit accounts (excluding time deposits and customer repurchase agreements) has slowed to single digit growth for the past two years, resulting in a loan-to-deposit ratio that exceeded 100% at December\u00a031, 2007. As loan growth outpaced deposit growth, our mix of funding shifted to a higher level of wholesale funds that are at a higher interest rate than core deposits. Asset quality remained exceptional with nonperforming loans to total loans at only 18 basis points at the end of 2007., 476444=2010, 459765=1275 Tremont Pl., Denver, CO 80202, 778051=We conducted our annual evaluation of our reporting units as of December\u00a031, 2007.\u00a0 As discussed in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for the period ending December\u00a031, 2007 the estimated fair value of all reporting units exceeded their carrying values and goodwill impairment was not deemed to exist.\u00a0 The fair value calculations were also tested for sensitivity to reflect reasonable variations, including keeping all other variables constant and reducing projected revenue growth and projected cost savings. Using this sensitivity approach, there was no impairment identified in any reporting unit.\u00a0 However, during 2007, the volume of high-end wealth transfer cases completed during the year decreased from prior years, leading to an overall reduction in operating revenue and cash flow for the insurance unit.\u00a0 As such, revenues were less than the projected target.\u00a0 Although we fully expect wealth-transfer activity to increase to a normal level in 2008, if the unit continues to recognize operational losses and/or a significant decrease in revenue and cash flows, evaluation of the fair value could result in the determination that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value and that goodwill relating to the unit has been impaired.\u00a0 If we were to conclude that goodwill has been impaired, that conclusion could result in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge, which would adversely affect our results of operations., 240139=On December\u00a031, 2007, we acquired Wagner Investment Management,\u00a0Inc. (\u0093Wagner\u0094), a Denver-based SEC-registered investment advisory firm providing investment management services for high-net-worth individuals and families, foundations and non-profit organizations. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and accordingly, the results of Wagner have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of purchase. All outstanding shares of stock in Wagner were acquired by CoBiz in the transaction. We anticipate no change in the management structure of Wagner and continued use of the Wagner name in its marketing initiatives., 241498=On January\u00a02, 2008, we acquired all the assets and employees of Bernard Dietrich\u00a0& Associates (\u0093BDA\u0094) through our subsidiary, CoBiz Insurance,\u00a0Inc. Founded in 1993, BDA provides commercial and personal property and casualty insurance brokerage, as well risk management consulting services to individuals and businesses.\u00a0 The asset purchase was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and accordingly, the results of BDA will be included in our consolidated financial statements in periods subsequent to January\u00a02, 2008., 194157=Indicate by check mark whether the registrant (1)\u00a0has filed all reports required to be filed by Section\u00a013 or 15(d)\u00a0of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that the registrant was required to file such reports), and (2)\u00a0has been subject to such filing requirements for the past 90 days., 448376=2409 W. Main St., Littleton, CO 80120, 780233=On January\u00a01, 2006, we adopted SFAS No.\u00a0123(R), Share-Based Payment (\u0093SFAS 123(R)\u0094), using the modified prospective method. Under this method, compensation cost is recognized for (1)\u00a0all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified, cancelled or repurchased after that date and (2)\u00a0the portion of prior awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered, based on the grant-date fair value of those awards calculated for pro forma disclosures under SFAS No.\u00a0123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (\u0093SFAS 123\u0094). Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), we applied the intrinsic-value method for our stock-based compensation plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.\u00a025 (\u0093APB\u00a025\u0094) Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, which was allowed by SFAS 123 as an alternative to the fair value method recommended by SFAS\u00a0123., 803202=General. We provide a broad range of commercial and retail lending services, including commercial loans, commercial and residential real estate construction loans, commercial and residential real estate mortgage loans, consumer loans, revolving lines of credit, and equipment lease financing. Our primary lending focus is commercial and real estate lending to small and medium-sized businesses with annual sales of $5.0 million to $75.0 million, and businesses and individuals with borrowing requirements of $250,000 to $10.0 million. At December\u00a031, 2007, substantially all of our outstanding loans were to customers within Colorado and Arizona. Interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk, maturity, underwriting and servicing costs, principal amount, and extent of other banking relationships with the customer, and are further subject to competitive pressures, money market rates, availability of funds, and government regulations. See \u0093Net Interest Income\u0094 for an analysis of the interest rates on our loans., 236152=2003 Acquisitions, 342374=Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u0093Sarbanes-Oxley Act\u0094). The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is intended to address systemic and structural weaknesses of the capital markets in the United States that were perceived to have contributed to recent corporate scandals. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also attempts to enhance the responsibility of corporate management by, among other things, (i)\u00a0requiring the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of public companies to provide certain certifications in their periodic reports regarding the accuracy of the periodic reports filed with the SEC, (ii)\u00a0prohibiting officers and directors of public companies from fraudulently influencing an accountant engaged in the audit of the company\u0092s financial statements, (iii)\u00a0requiring chief executive officers and chief financial officers to forfeit certain bonuses in the event of a restatement of financial results, (iv)\u00a0prohibiting officers and directors found to be unfit from serving in a similar capacity with other public companies, (v)\u00a0prohibiting officers and directors from trading in the company\u0092s equity securities during pension blackout periods, and (vi)\u00a0requiring the SEC to issue standards of professional conduct for attorneys representing public companies. In addition, public companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange or association must satisfy the following additional requirements: (a)\u00a0the company\u0092s audit committee must appoint and oversee the company\u0092s auditors; (b)\u00a0each member of the company\u0092s audit committee must be independent; (c)\u00a0the company\u0092s audit committee must establish procedures for receiving complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls and audit-related matters; (d)\u00a0the company\u0092s audit committee must have the authority to engage independent advisors; and (e)\u00a0the company must provide appropriate funding to its audit committee, as determined by the audit committee., 324661=Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the \u0093GLB Act\u0094). The GLB Act eliminates many of the restrictions placed on the activities of certain qualified financial or bank holding companies. A \u0093financial holding company\u0094 such as CoBiz can expand into a wide variety of financial services, including securities activities, insurance and merchant banking without the prior approval of the FRB., 785192=On December\u00a031, 2006, the Company adopted Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No.\u00a0108 Topic 1N, Financial Statements \u0096 Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (\u0093SAB 108\u0094). Prior to SAB 108, Companies would evaluate the materiality of financial statement misstatements using either the current year income statement (\u0093rollover\u0094 ) or balance sheet approach (\u0093iron curtain\u0094), with the rollover approach focusing on new misstatements added in the current year, and the iron curtain approach focusing on the cumulative amount of misstatement present in a company\u0092s balance sheet. Misstatements that would be material under one approach could be viewed as immaterial under another approach, and not be corrected. Under SAB 108 a registrant\u0092s financial statements require adjustment when either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that is material, after considering all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. Registrants are not required to restate prior period financial statements when initially applying SAB 108 if management properly applied its previous approach (i.e. rollover or iron curtain) given that all relevant qualitative factors were considered. SAB 108 states that, upon initial application, registrants may elect to (a)\u00a0restate prior periods, or (b)\u00a0record the cumulative effect of the initial application of SAB 108 in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, with the offsetting adjustment made to retained earnings. To the extent that registrants elect to record the cumulative effect of initially applying SAB 108, disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected in the cumulative adjustment is required. The disclosure must include when and how each error being corrected arose and the fact that the errors had previously been considered immaterial. SAB 108 was effective for the fiscal year ending December\u00a031, 2006. The adoption of SAB\u00a0108 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements., 755476=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Insurance segment had a large decrease in net income and earnings per share during 2007, primarily due to a decrease in the wealth transfer business. The wealth transfer business is transactional by nature and fluctuates based on the number of life insurance policies closed during a year. During 2007, the segment had a higher-than-normal number of cases that were rejected in underwriting due to unforeseen medical issues. To a lesser extent, the segment was also impacted by the overall reduction in insurance premiums being realized throughout the commercial insurance industry., 178449=x\u00a0\u00a0Annual Report pursuant to Section\u00a013 or 15(d)\u00a0of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934., 569341=2003, 792967=On December\u00a031, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Staff Position (\u0093FSP\u0094) No.\u00a0FIN 39-1, Amendment of FASB Interpretation No.\u00a039 (\u0093FSP FIN 39-1\u0094). FSP FIN 39-1 modifies FIN No.\u00a039, Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts, and permits companies to offset cash collateral receivables or payables with net derivative positions under certain circumstances. The adoption of FSP FIN 39-1 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements., 323933=The 1994 Act also permits bank subsidiaries of a financial or bank holding company to act as agents for affiliated institutions by receiving deposits, renewing time deposits, closing loans, servicing loans and receiving payments on loans. As a result, a relatively small Colorado or Arizona bank owned by an out-of-state holding company could make available to customers in Colorado and Arizona some of the services of a larger affiliated institution located in another state., 521751=12/31/2002, 564614=The following table sets forth selected financial data for the Company for the periods indicated. During the periods reported, the Company has completed three acquisitions of companies as described in Part\u00a0I, Item 1. In addition, data has been restated to give retroactive effect to a three-for-two stock split effectuated on April\u00a026, 2004, where applicable., 467405=12775 W. Bell Rd., Surprise, AZ 85374, 800564=In December\u00a02007, the FASB issued SFAS No.\u00a0160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements \u0096 An Amendment of ARB No.\u00a05 (\u0093SFAS 160\u0094). This Statement amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity and should be reported as equity on the financial statements. SFAS 160 requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. Furthermore, disclosure of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest is required on the face of the financial statements. SFAS 160 is effective as of the beginning of an entity\u0092s first fiscal year that begins after December\u00a015, 2008. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, SFAS 160 will have on its consolidated financial statements., 455992=212 Chambers Ave., Unit # 3, Eagle, CO 81631, 750834=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Effective January\u00a02007, the FDIC changed its risk-based assessment matrix and the assessment rates charged to financial institutions. Prior to the change the Bank was not assessed a rate based on the Bank\u0092s risk category. Under the new assessment matrix the Bank will be assessed a rate between 5 to 7 basis points, which is the lowest rate under the new framework. This has increased the Company\u0092s regulatory assessment costs in 2007 and will continue to impact future periods., 524179=12/31/2006, 688214=1863.95, 787571=On January\u00a01, 2007, the Company adopted SFAS No.\u00a0155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instrument \u0097 an amendment of SFAS No.\u00a0133 and SFAS No.\u00a0140. This statement permits fair value re-measurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. It establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation. In addition, SFAS No.\u00a0155 clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of SFAS No.\u00a0133. It also clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives. SFAS No.\u00a0155 amends SFAS No.\u00a0140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special-purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument. The adoption of SFAS 155 did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements., 339245=Support of Banks. As discussed below, the Bank is also subject to capital adequacy requirements. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (the \u0093FDICIA\u0094), CoBiz could be required to guarantee the capital restoration plan of the Bank, should the Bank become \u0093undercapitalized\u0094 as defined in the FDICIA and the regulations thereunder. See \u0093\u0097 The Bank \u0097 Capital Adequacy.\u0094\u00a0 Our maximum liability under any such guarantee would be the lesser of 5% of the Bank\u0092s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount necessary to bring the Bank into compliance with the capital plan. The FRB also has stated that financial or bank holding companies are subject to the \u0093source, 464855=1757 E. Baseline Rd., Ste. 101, Gilbert, AZ 85233, 522965=12/31/2004, 548123=August 1 - 31, 2007, 444558=2025 Pearl St., Boulder, CO 80302, 370309=On November\u00a02, 2007, the Federal Reserve Board approved final rules\u00a0to implement new risk-based capital requirements for banking organizations with total assets of $250 billion or more or with consolidated total on-balance-sheet foreign exposure of $10 billion or more. The new risk-based regulatory capital framework, known as Basel II, consists of three pillars that address (1)\u00a0risk-based capital requirements for credit risk, market risk and operational risk; (2)\u00a0supervisory review of capital adequacy, which relates to an organization\u0092s capital adequacy and internal assessment processes; and (3)\u00a0market discipline.

We believe the Colorado and Arizona markets provide us with significant opportunities for internal growth. These markets continue to be dominated by a number of large regional and national financial institutions that have acquired locally based banks. We believe this consolidation has created gaps in the banking industry\u0092s ability to serve certain customers in these market areas because small and medium-sized businesses often are not large enough to warrant significant marketing focus and customer service from large banks. In addition, we believe these banks often do not satisfy the needs of high-net-worth individuals who desire personal attention from experienced bankers. Similarly, we believe many of the remaining independent banks in the region do not provide the sophisticated banking products and services such customers require.",
