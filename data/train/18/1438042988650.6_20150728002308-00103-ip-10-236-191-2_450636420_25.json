            "HIGHLY INTEGRATED DATA BUS AUTOMATIC FIRE EXTINGUISHING SYSTEM - A fire extinguishing system includes a first data bus having respectively first power and command leads. The system has multiple zones, each of which may include one or more detectors, and/or one or more suppressors and activation devices. The first data bus is directly connected and common to the detectors, suppressors and activation devices. A controller is connected to the multiple zones via the first data bus. A fire activation module includes the actuation device. First and second power leads are connected to the actuation device. A capacitor is connected to the actuation device and the power leads. The capacitor is configured to store electricity from the power leads and discharge the electricity to the actuation device during a suppression event. A wiring harness provides a zone identification element in communication with a connector and configured to provide a zone location assignment to the connector.",
            "METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR IMPROVING EQUITY TRADE ORDER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TIMES - A method and system for improving stock exchange equity trade order acknowledgment times including a network appliance (\u201ctrade accelerator\u201d) in the sub-network of the trading platforms, having a specialized network flow processor with associated micro-code and a host processor running specialized software. Specialized network appliance software sensitive to trading protocols for communicating between trading platforms and exchange servers detects latency variations in trade order acknowledgments at the exchange and recommends to subscribing trading platforms a least latency trade order path.",
            "HIGHLY INTEGRATED DATA BUS AUTOMATIC FIRE EXTINGUISHING SYSTEM - A fire activation module for a fire extinguishing system includes an actuation device that has an instantaneous actuation current draw during a suppression event. First and second power leads are connected to the actuation device and have a current capacity less than the instantaneous actuation current draw. At least one capacitor is connected to the actuation device and the power leads. The capacitor is configured to store electricity from the power leads and discharge the electricity to the actuation device during the suppression event.",

The method comprises providing the substrate with a wear protection layer and providing corrosion resistant layer. The wear protection layer can be applied to the gear and then the corrosion resistant layer can be applied over the wear resistant layer. Alternatively, the corrosion resistant lay can be provided and then the wear resistant layer can be formed over the corrosion resistant layer. 20090053486 Published Description Patent application number Elizabeth P. Cooke, Lyme, NH US 12-02-2010 Acoustic medical sensor for ultrasound imaging - A finger mounted acoustic sensor. Various embodiments of the finger mounted acoustic sensors include sensors mounted within a casing designed to fit between fingers. The sensor may be rotated with respect to the casing. Other",
