    "textBeforeTable": "Hokkaid\u014d[edit] Each table has three columns. The Romaji column lists the reading of the place name. The Kanji column shows the kanji that are read as shown under Romaji. Most of these are within a larger place such as a ward, municipality, or district. The Location column names the larger ward, municipality or district where the place with the unusual reading is located. Explanation of table[edit] The place names listed below are from north to south by region and prefecture, and then alphabetical within each prefecture. Examples[edit] The town of Yonashiro, which used to be called Yonagusuku serves as an example of a placename that shifted to a more Japanese pronunciation. The former capital city of Shuri once bore a pronunciation closer to Sui. East (\u6771) and West (\u897f), higashi and nishi respectively in Japanese, are pronounced agari and iri in Okinawan. This shows up in the name of the island of Iriomote. The Okinawan word for \"castle\" (\u57ce) is gusuku, which is read in Japanese as shiro. This is frequently seen, expectedly, in the names for castles, and the towns and areas around them. Some examples",
