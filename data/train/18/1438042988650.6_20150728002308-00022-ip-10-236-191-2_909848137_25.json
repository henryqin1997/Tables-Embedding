            "HPU is not in position to offer huge grant for students. However what you get for your money is pretty special. All in, your cost might be just over $40k a year, but you definetely get your money's worth. And if you end up employed in your field of concentration after graduation (as do over 80%), it will have paid off.",
            "High Point is a small town and not much surrounds the school, so HPU has created their own stress-free zone on campus. They have a game (arcade) room with pretty much everything from pool tables to ping pong, foosball, hoops, fruit ninja, pacman, and even karaoke. They also have their own theatre that shows movies before they are released to video or netflix. All comes at no extra charge for their students.",
            "We did not eat on campus, but what we saw was impressive. One of the perks of attending HPU is being able to dine at the 1924 Prime Steakhouse. Each student is allowed to eat there (with reservation) once a week. They use the experience to teach students about international cuisine and proper dining etiquette. Additionally, there are other places on campus, around town, and into Greensboro that accept your HPU Passport card, so the meal plan is more than sufficient!",
            "The dorms they display are to die for. Freshman Honors students are afforded the opportunity to live in fully furnished dorm suites that come with living rooms appointed with leather seating and flat panel TVs, full kitchens, dinette tables and two bedrooms.",
            "This is the one area I'm not so sure of. The school does a tremendous job rolling out the red carpet that I wonder if it is overcompensating for a deficiency in this area. After all, its all about what you learn. I did not get the impression that the educational experience was lacking...I'm just unsure. Everything I saw was so outstanding, I almost felt like it was too good to be true. For that reason, I will remain neutral until I learn more. Without question, I will do the research.",
            "By far, the best visit I had this spring break was provided by HPU. The college was so well appointed that it looked and felt like a vacation resort where learning occurs. I imagine their students prefer to stay on campus during holidays instead of going home."

That being said, try not to plan your visit to HPU as one of the first you go on. The campus is gorgeous and it's hard to look at other schools after seeing it without comparing them to HPU. Also, make sure you apply for the presidential scholarships. They're usually due in mid-December so make sure you get the application in on time., 20160=I am from MD so when I heard of HPU and it being in NC, at first I was slightly worried because it is so far away from my family, but at HPU you make a new huge family. There is so much to do here. For example, we have an Arcade, two general stores, the Extraordinaire Cinema, the 1924 Prime Steakhouse, the Great Day Bakery, The Point Grill, as well as Starbucks, Subway, and Chik-fil-A., 217876=Greek life on campus is always doing fundraisers for all kinds of associations or for them to do a type of volunteer work. They had t-shirt tie-dying one night! It was only five dollars. Also, recruitment doesn't start until January so you have plenty time to decide if you want to be a part of Greek life and which one., 161504=First off, there is 9 restaurants on campus, 11 if you include Starbucks. You have your traditional cafe which changes their menu each day (but keeping things such as the omelet line or pizza line open each day). Also on campus is a Subway, Chick-fil-a, the Great Day Bakery (similar to a Panera Bread), the Point (sports grill), and more! The BEST dining option on campus is the steakhouse, called 1924 Prime. This is a five star steakhouse for the students and faculty of HPU, while its a great meal to have, you also gain valuable etiquette skills when you dine there. Each student can eat at the steakhouse at least once a week if they make their reservations on time!, 283903=There are not many traditions on campus, but the first Saturday after classes in August is Derby day where there are many activities and food trucks on the Promenade. Everything is free to students. On Halloween, something similar to Derby day occurs on the Promenade with complimentary food trucks as well. Some traditions that the university encourages students to participate in is not walking across the university seal until graduation and placing their hands in the fountain behind the student center after the Honor Code Signing Ceremony., 13128=Apply for the scholarships very early. You can't apply if you are transferring or after your freshman year. Scholarship deadline ends in December so you can deffinitely apply for them even if you haven't gotten accepted yet. Basically, HPU is looking for leaders with school spirit, determination, and good values. You have to be more than just an SAT score or GPA., 106072=We did not eat on campus, but what we saw was impressive. One of the perks of attending HPU is being able to dine at the 1924 Prime Steakhouse. Each student is allowed to eat there (with reservation) once a week. They use the experience to teach students about international cuisine and proper dining etiquette. Additionally, there are other places on campus, around town, and into Greensboro that accept your HPU Passport card, so the meal plan is more than sufficient!, 158676=The 1924 Prime is an unusual location due to its uniqueness. As far as traditions go, we have an eagle that flies at Convocation and Commencement symbolizing a transition from one chapter of your life to the next. For Convocation, the new freshmen are being welcomed onto campus and the eagle symbolizes the parents setting them free out of their nests for their time here at HPU. When this happens Dr. Foster sings You Raise Me Up, its a real tear jerker (I'll admit, it was tough to hold back my tears!). On the flip side of this symbolism, each student is given a blanket and they are instructed to give this blanket to their parents. For their whole life, our parents have loved and cared for us, and this blanket symbolizes the love and care that we have towards our parents but also thanks them for what they have done for us at the same time. At Commencement, the eagle flies as the graduate are set out free into the real world., 152596=The term freshman 15 is just a myth! Here on campus, you have the options to eat at upscale dining restaurants (1924 Prime) or at a fresh food buffet (The Farmers Market). They even have options for those who are vegan, gluten-tolerant, and nutritionally alert., 312876=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 46698=There's so many things to enjoy around campus. Where else can you sign up for outdoor adventure trips (most times free), attend free sports games, enjoy dining at the many restaurants on campus and the 1924 Prime Steakhouse, hang out with friends at the arcade, enjoy a movie at the Extraordinary Theater, go the Campus Concierge with questions, have campus wide wireless internet, attend free plays and concerts, rent movies from the library (for free), have free laundry, free cable and more???}",

Tips for prospective students Make sure you come to visit the campus. It will blow you away with its beauty and luxury. Bang for the buck Students receive a great education while living on a comfortable and enjoyable campus. To have such accommodations on any other campus would cost students a fortune but here at High Point University, most costs are all inclusive in the tuition. We have a movie theater which is all free including one drink, one snack, and a nice serving of popcorn. Am enjoying being here The campus is reminiscent of an upscale country club. Lush green lawns with bronze statues and numerous water fountains decorate the campus and wrap you in a luxurious state of being. The buildings have all been either remodeled or are",
