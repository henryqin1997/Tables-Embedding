They were great at getting the ball inside last year. Like I said, they led the country in rebound margin. They were very aggressive. How much that will change this year based on a couple guys that aren't playing remains to be seen, but they went to some sets where they just pounded it inside and they also had great movement sets. In that sense, I think it's very good for you.\" Because it is not scrimmaging another Division I team this year as it has done the prior two seasons, Indiana will also play a second exhibition game on November 4th againsgt Hillsdale College, a Division II program out of Michigan. Southern Indiana is no stranger to exhibitions against Big Ten programs. The Eagles played Illinois tough in 2010, falling 76-67. Two seasons ago USI fell to Purdue, 65-49, but did outscore the Boilermakers in the second half. \"I think Southern Indiana because of that experience back, we didn't want to play anybody that was in a similar situation to us experience wise,\"",
