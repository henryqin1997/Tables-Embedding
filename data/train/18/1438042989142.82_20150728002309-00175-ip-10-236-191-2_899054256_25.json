            "There are the blue emergency alert poles everywhere, and campus police is always there, even when classes are not in session.",
            "-Young -New to city life -Not ready to move far away from home -Have a job, kids, or any other big responsibilites (Lots of classes offered throughout the whole day, including evenings)",
            "Great school if you're looking for simple, quiet, and just get through to get on to a University. They also offer plenty of two-year programs for those who lots of college isn't an option. Best of all, Del Mar is CHEAP!",
            "I work and unfortunately don't have the time to take advantage of all the clubs and intramural sports they have on campus, but they are always advertising them! I've even seen a flyer looking for some Ultimate Frisbee players--fun! Del Mar is in Corpus Christi which is hot most of the year, so you always have the beach! Bonfires and beach parties are thrown year-round. Make some friends and you'll see many!",
            "Not very many options, sad to say. Everyone can agree that junk-food is pretty delicious, but doesn't do to well for the body. (We don't need any help with the Freshman 15, or the Sophomore 20!) Although, on those days you forget to bring your lunch, they do have some healthy options, including tasty parfaits and wraps.",
            "Sorry, no dorms for Del Mar!",
            "I give Del Mar four stars. If for some reason you have difficulty understanding something from your professors, Del Mar offers MANY student instructors, tutors, study groups, and programs to keep you on task and get you through your work.",
            "Tip 1: Get your financial aid in early! Del Mar is notorious for withholding your money, and leaves many students in a bind when it comes to coughing up half of our tuition, on top of book expenses. Tip 2: Get to class! Most classes are small, and your professor WILL notice when you're not there. Tip 3: Avoid the Harvin Center from 12-1. It's a crowded, loud, nightmare! (Unless of course you're into that sort of thing) Tip 4: During registration, go as early as possible. The earlier, the better. After about 10 A.M., especially close to school starting, the lines are horrendous. Tip 5: I have three words for you: Stone Writing Center. They have a great reputation for helping out students with their papers. So if you're iffy about a paper, I definitely reccommend swinging by there and having them check your work. It's free and there for you, so take advantage of it!",
            "Del Mar is a great transition for students from highschool to college with small classrooms, cheap tuition, a good-sized campus, and many great, helpful and understanding professors. However, they seem to lack in the general area of staff that are supposed to help students find their way through college. The financial aid staff and the counselors are not very helpful when trying to register for classes, often send us students in circles, and don't have any genuine sense of urgency or concern regarding students attending the school."
