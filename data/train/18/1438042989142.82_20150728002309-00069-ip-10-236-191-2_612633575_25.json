Furthermore, high resolution monitors of\u00a0up to 3840x2160 pixels can now be connected using DisplayPort 1.2 or HDMI 1.4a\u00a0if available. HD-Audio codecs, such as Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD, can be\u00a0transmitted via bitstream mode through the HDMI port. However, as most laptops\u00a0will feature Optimus, the integrated GPU will likely have direct control over\u00a0the display ports and may limit the feature set available by the Nvidia Kepler\u00a0cards., 12040=The\u00a0NVIDIA GeForce GT 640M\u00a0is a mid-range, DirectX 11.1 compatible graphics card that was announced in the first quarter of 2012 for laptops. It is a Kepler-based GPU built on the GK107 architecture and is manufactured in 28nm at TSMC. The graphics card uses a 128-Bit wide memory interface with either the more common but slower DDR3 for VRAM or the more expensive and faster GDDR5., 10455=The gaming performance of the\u00a0GeForce GT 640M equipped with DDR3 graphics memory lies somewhere in the former\u00a02011 high-end category between the older\u00a0GeForce GT 555M\u00a0and\u00a0GeForce GTX 460M.\u00a0The performance is exceptionally good in shader-heavy DirectX 11 games and\u00a0benchmarks. However, the 128-Bit memory interface can be a bottleneck if DDR3\u00a0graphics memory is used. In our tests, demanding\u00a0games of 2011 like Battlefield 3 are playable in 1366x768 and medium settings.\u00a0Less demanding games, such as Modern Warfare 3, are easily playable with maxed\u00a0out settings and high resolutions. Details on synthetic and gaming\u00a0benchmarks performances of the GT 640M can be seen below.\u00a0The more uncommon GDDR5 version of the GT 640M is slightly faster, getting closer to the DDR3 version of the\u00a0GT 650M.}",
