    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6739=The protocols for tissue fixing and staining for electron microscopy followed that described by Trachtenberg (Annuals of Botany, 1984, 53, pp. 227-236). Briefly, fresh pulp tissue blocks were fixed at room temperature in 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.2 M cacodylate-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) for 2 hrs followed by fixing for 2 hrs in 2% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer. The tissues were dehydrated and sectioned after embedding in resin. The tissue sections were stained with uranyl acetate, and examined using a Zeiss 10C electron microscope. The light microscopy of leaf sections showed that the pulp (3) consisted of large clear mesophyll cells, which exhibited a hexagonal shape (FIG. 2). The sizes of these cells were very large, often more than 300 \u03bcm in width. The walls of these cells were clear and transparent. The cells in the rind (1) were much smaller as compared to those in the pulp (3) (FIG. 2). Electron microscope examinations revealed, in addition to cell walls (6), liquid gel (7), only the cell membranes in the pulp along with very limited number of degenerative cellular organelles (8) (FIG. 3). Nuclei, chloroplasts and other cellular organelles such as mitochondria were only observed in the green rind and vascular bundles, (2) (FIG. 2).}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{210069=The average size of HMW Aloe pectins (1.1\ufffd106 Da) is much larger than that (0.7-1.4\ufffd105 Da) of commercial pectins, which is close to that of LMW Aloe pectins. To confirm this size difference, three commercial citrus pectin samples, one LM (P-9311, lot 74H1092; Sigma Chemical Co.) and two HM (P-9436, lot 96H0788; Sigma Chemical Co. and PE100, lot JR071, Spectrum Chemical Co.), were analyzed by SEC under the same conditions. Their sizes ranged from 2.0-4.6\ufffd105 Da, being much lower than those of HMW Aloe pectins. The sizes of citrus pectins are usually larger than those of apple pectins (Pilnik and Voragen, Advances in Plant Biochemistry and Biotechnology, 1992, 99, pp. 219-270)., 68952=Other conditions were also examined for Aloe pectin extraction. Hot dilute acid and cold alkaline solutions are two other common conditions for pectin extraction. Both of them can cause extensive degradation. Commercial pectins from citrus and apple were extracted under the hot dilute acid condition. Using this condition for the Aloe pectin, the pH of fiber suspensions was adjusted to 1.5 with HCl followed by HT up to 80\ufffd C. The yield obtained is much lower compared to using EDTA extraction (Table 5). The extraction by HT in water alone yielded virtually no alcohol precipitable materials. Renault and Thibault (Renault and Thibault, Carbohydrate Research, 1993, 244, pp. 99-114) reported that extraction of apple and sugar beet fibers in PBS (pH 6.5) with HT (80\ufffd C.) generated a high yield similar to that by EDTA extraction. Using this condition, only a low yield was obtained from the Aloe vera pulp fibers (Table 5). Cold alkaline extraction was performed with 50 mM NaOH or 50 mM Na2CO3 at 4\ufffd C. The pH in suspension was 11.5 with 50 mM NaOH and 10.5 with 50 mM Na2CO3. After 1 hr at 4\ufffd C., a very low yield was obtained with 50 mM Na2CO3. No alcohol precipitable materials were obtained with 50 mM NaOH. When the extraction was done at RT for 1 hr, no yield was obtained with either agent, suggesting that pectins are rapidly degraded under these conditions., 33714=There are many enzymes that can specifically modify and degrade pectin molecules. These enzymes include endo- and exo-polygalacturonase (EC3.2.1.15 and EC 3.2.1.67), pectate lyase (EC 4.2.2.10), pectin methylesterase (EC 3.1.1.11), pectin acetylesterase, and rhamnogalacturonase. Endo-polygalacturonase is specific for non-esterified \u03b11-4 linked Gal A residues and requires four adjacent non-esterified Gal A residues to function. This enzyme can be produced by plants, fungi, and bacteria., 205216=The method described by Rombouts and Thibault (Carbohydrate Research, 1986,282, pp. 271-284) was used. Pectin samples in 0.6 ml water were mixed with 0.6 ml of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. After 3 min, 0.6 ml of 1 M sodium carbonate was added. The mixtures were left at RT for 1 hr before the 750 nm absorbance values were determined. Ferulic acid was used as a standard. Some precipitates formed after pectin samples were mixed with the reagents. They appeared to be colorless and removed by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 15 min before absorbance measurement at 750 nm., 24148=This application claims the priority of each of the U.S. patent applications, recited in this paragraph, and is a divisional application of U.S. Utility application Ser. No. 10/422,867 filed Apr. 23, 2003, which was a continuation of U.S. Utility application Ser. No. 09/325,610, filed Jun. 3, 1999 and now granted as U.S. Pat. No. 7,022,783, which was a divisional application of U.S. Utility application Ser. No. 09/078,204, filed May 13, 1998, now granted as U.S. Pat. No. 5,929,051. The disclosure of all the above-recited parent applications is hereby incorporated herein in their entirety by this reference., 116350=Linkage analysis. The Hakomori method (Hakomori, Journal of Biochemistry, 1984, 55, pp. 205-212) of methylation with superdeuteride reduction was used. The samples were suspended in DMSO and subjected to sonication at 60\ufffd C. for 36 hrs in a bath type ultrasonicator. Samples were then methylated using potassium methylsulfonyl carbanion (3.6 M) followed by the addition of a 50-100 fold excess of methyl iodide. The partially methylated material was isolated by reverse phase cartridge chromatography and subjected to carboxyl reduction. The samples were then purified and subjected to remethylation according to the Hakomori procedure. The sample was then hydrolyzed and converted to partially methylated alditol acetates. The resulting PMAA derivatives were analyzed by GC-MS using a 30 m SP-2300 capillary column., 210953=Intrinsic viscosities were determined using the Ubbelhode viscometer (No. 2). Pectins were dissolved in 0.1 M NaC1 at a concentration of 0.005-0.2% (w/v) (Owens, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 1946, 68, pp. 1628-1632; Axelos, International Journal of Biological Macromolecules, 1989, 11, pp. 186-191.) The intrinsic viscosity (\u03b7) was calculated using double Huggins (\u03b7sp/c=\u03b7+k1\u03b72c) and Kraemer ([ln \u03b7rel]/c=\u03b7+k\u2033\u03b72c) extrapolation (to zero concentration) (Axelos and Thilbault, International Journal of Biological Macromolecules, 1989, 11, pp. 186-191; Doublier and Cuvelier, Carbohydrates in Food, ed. A. C. Eliasson, Marcel Dekker, New York, 1996, pp. 283-318). The averages of the numbers obtained with these two equations are presented in Table 13 in comparison with MW., 40389=A set of techniques has been established for pectin analysis. The Gal A content is determined by the method using m-hydroxyldiphenyl for color formation. This assay is simpler than previous assays and has minimal interference from neutral sugars. Other assays for Gal A determination have also been described. Sugar compositions are analyzed by GLC or GC-MS using alditol acetate or trimethylsilylether (\u201cTMS\u201d) derivatization. GLC procedures are most often used to determine methyl ester content, which involves saponification with base (0.5N) and measurement of methanol by GLC on a Poropak Q columan at 120\ufffd C. or a Carbowax 1500 column at 125\ufffd C. A capillary electrophoresis method has also been examined for determining DE of pectins. A rapid and sensitive calorimetric assay is used to measure the acetyl groups., 125370=The sugar composition analysis showed that Gal A was the primary sugar, 67% in AP 10679 and 63.2% in AP 97-1. The rhamnose and galactose are the most abundant neutral sugars, accounting for 10-11.1% and 8.5-14.8%, respectively. Among the minor neutral sugars, a modified sugar, 3-OMe-rhamnose was detected, which accounted for about 10% of total rhamnose. The sugar compositions were very similar between the two samples, except for a small amount (<0.5%) of GalNAc and glycerol detected in AP 10679., 41239=The size determination is achieved by various means which include viscosity, HPSEC, and gel permeation chromatography. Recently, light scattering has been proposed as a more accurate method. The intrinsic viscosities of pectins are often determined using the Ubbelohde viscometer. This is done in the presence of 0.1-0.15 M NaCl due to the electrolytic nature of pectin molecules., 240536=The cell wall fibers (as obtained in Example 3) are packed into the supercritical fluid (SF) extraction cell which is then sealed. The SF generator is turned on and upon reaching the desired conditions of temperature and pressure, the SF is pumped into the extraction cell at the appropriate flowrate. The pectin-rich exiting fluid is allowed to cool in the decompression chamber. The cooled fluid is then treated to isolate the pectin. One isolation method is to precipitate the pectin by the addition of a water-soluble organic solvent, preferably ethanol, to the fluid or partially evaporated fluid. The precipitated material is then separated by filtration or centrifugation and dried. The pectin can also be isolated from the fluid by removal of the fluid through freeze drying or evaporation. The fluid to be used for the SF extraction may be water or an aqueous solution containing an acid or a base or a buffer salt or a water-soluble organic modifier or any combination of the preceding additives. The process can be operated at temperatures between about 300\ufffd C. and about 800\ufffd C. and at pressures between about 200 atm. and about 1000 atm., 201927=Aloe pectin was dissolved in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). Endo-polygalacturonase (EC3.2.1.15) was added at various concentrations (0.25-25 mU). After incubation at room temperature for 1 hr, samples were immediately mixed with the sample buffer (pH 9.0) and separated by acidic polysaccharide gel electrophoresis as described above., 60368=BAM was dissolved in water at 2 mg/ml. The solutions were stirred at room temperature for 3 hrs or at 4\ufffd C. for overnight. They were then centrifuged at low speed (1000 rpm or 180 g) for 15 min (Beckman TJ-6). The pellet was collected, washed once with water, and dried (Centrivap, Labconco). The weight of pellet was determined following drying. A small sample of the pellet was examined under the light microscope (Olympus BH-2). The insoluble pellet materials from the pulp extracts appeared to be fibers at low magnification (4\ufffd), and to be clear transparent sheets at higher magnification (10\ufffd and 40\ufffd) with an appearance identical to those clear pulp cell walls described above. With less extensive homogenization, some of these fibers still retained the original structural features of the mesophyll cells. These observations together indicate that the insoluble fibers are derived from the pulp mesophyll cell walls., 203054=The acetyl groups were detected by derivatization with hydroxylamine HCl and ferric acid. Acetylcholine (0.001-0.0005 N) was used as the standard. Samples were tested at various concentrations (0.2-0.8 mg/ml). Both samples and standards were prepared in 1 ml 0.001 N acetate buffer and mixed with 2 ml of hydroxylamine HCl reagent (2 M hydroxylamine HCl mixed 1:1 with 3.5 N NaOH). After about 1 min, 1 ml 4 N HCl was added. After another 1 minute, 1 ml of 0.37 M ferric chloride (in 0.1 N HCl) was added. Following mixing, the absorbance at 540 nm was measured. The amount of acetyl groups in mole was determined by extrapolating against the linear regression curve of the standard. The degree of acetylation (DAc) of the pectins was expressed as % (mole/mole) of Gal A., 245066=Black india ink is made of tiny carbon particles that tend to precipitate over time when the suspension is left undisturbed. To demonstrate the ability of the monovalent cation-based gel to prevent precipitation, black india ink was introduced into the gel system. The black india ink (Higgins, Faber-Castell Corporation, NJ) was diluted 1000 times in 0.15 M NaC1. The diluted ink was the mixed with equal volumes of 2 mg/ml Aloe pectin in 0.15 M NaC1 or with the 0.15 NaC1 only as a control. The mixtures were placed on ice. The mixture with pectin quickly formed a gel and the control remained a solution. Both samples were then stored at 4\ufffd C. After 48 hrs, it was evident that the upper portion of the control solution was less dark as compared to the lower portion and a dense black area had formed at the bottom. This indicated that precipitation of the india ink particles had occurred. On the other hand, the gel was evenly dark and no dense black area was observed at the bottom of the tube. When the gel changed back to solution when returned to RT, the solution was also uniformly dark. This indicated that the gel could prevent the precipitation of the agents that may result from aggregation., 203858=Degree of methylation (DM) was determined using the selective reduction method described by Maness (Maness, Analytical Biochemistry, 1990, 185, pp. 346-352) with modifications. Pectin samples were prepared in 1 M imidazole-HCl buffer (pH 7.0). For each test, 1 mg sample in 400 \u03bcl was used. NaBH4 (40 mg) was added and the sample was kept on ice for 1 hr to selectively reduce the methyl-esterified Gal A residues. Then, 0.1 ml acetic acid was added to remove the remaining NaBH4. The sample was diluted with 0.5 ml water and the pectins were precipitated with 4 volumes of 95% ethanol. After being dried, the sample was dissolved in water and the Gal A content was determined as described above. The control went through the same steps except for the addition of NaBH4. The DM was determined by the following formula: DM=[(moles of Gal A in the control-moles of Gal A in the reduced)/moles of Gal A in the control]\ufffd100., 117199=Sugar composition analysis using FACE showed that the extracted pectin was richer in Gal A as compared to the cell wall fibers. The detailed compositions were obtained with TMS derivatization and GC-MS analysis. In Table 7, the sugar compositions of three samples, AP 10679, AP 10679 (purified as described in Example 4), and AP97-1, are presented (See also Table 1). Sample AP 10679 was obtained by HT extraction from alcohol-treated fibers as described in Example 3. Sample AP97-1 was a trial production sample extracted from non-alcohol-treated crude fibers. The fibers were extracted twice at room temperature followed by HT extraction. The pectins obtained from the two extraction conditions were combined and the ratio of the pectins extracted at RT over those by HT extraction was \u02dc2:1., 201345=The gel electrophoresis for separation of acidic polysaccharides was carried out as described by Misevic (Misevic, Methods in Enzymology, 1989,179, pp.95-110) using the Bio-Rad minigel apparatus. Tris-boric acid (pH 9.0) was used as both the gel and running buffer. A 15% polyacrylamide gel was found to be optimal. The gels were stained with alcian blue and destained with 2% (v/v) acetic acid.}",
