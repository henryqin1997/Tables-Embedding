I came from a high school with a graduating class of 100 people and I needed a small campus. When I have class it is a 17:1 ration, and usually it isn't even that big. Although it is a very diverse campus and can work for many different people., 150025=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 726=Interested in a 17:1 student to professor ratio? Interested in a small community within a large College/University mainstream? Interested in competing in football games amongst others? Come to Wesley!!}",

I like learning in smaller classes, and I like having conversations with the professors and ongoing debates. Tips for prospective students Check the campus. Go on a tour, and talk to some of the teachers and professors. If you know the major you want to go into, talk to the professors of some of the classes you'll be taking especially. It's a great school, but everybody is different. Bang for the buck I love Wesley, and it is a private college. However, without ANY scholarships, it is a lot of money, even for in-state students I know. It's over $15,000 unincluding if you're living there. But, they offer all types",
