For examples of previous charters, see the W3C list of Incubator Charters. Note that deliverables are the contract of the Incubator Group to the W3C, and it is expected deliverables will be completed within the XG's time frame (1 year). One proposal is that the proposed charter may be too large, due to having too many deliverables (15). A smaller charter with (5) deliverables was written earlier. 1. Which charter and how many deliverables? If not a W3C Member, would your organization be interested in joining the W3C? If a W3C member, would you be sponsoring the Social Web XG? Is your organization a W3C member? Should we delete user experience task force? Should we delete contextual data task force? Should we merge business practices and landscape taskforce groups? Should we merge interoperability task force with distributed architectures? Do you wish to nominate yourself as an Editor? Which parts of the social web",

However, it has been suggested that the Social Web XG divide into task forces based on interest, where task-forces are appointed when there is too much activity on distinct subjects and separate lists and telecons need to be set up. Should we start as a single group and divide into task forces as needed, or start the XG divided into task-forces? Summary Choice All responders Results Keep to one group, do not use task-forces unless absolutely necessary. 15 Use task-forces, even if activity is low. 17 Don't care. 8 Details Responder Should we stay one group or divide into task forces? Comments Harry Halpin Keep to one group, do not use task-forces unless absolutely necessary. Daniel Appelquist Use task-forces, even if activity is low. Michael Hausenblas Don't care.
