    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6098=FIG. 24 illustrates the carbonation and decarbonation kinetics of CO2 using commercially available CaO (J.T. Baker) as measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). FIG. 24 illustrates that the carbonation of CaO is divided into two distinct regions, the fast region and the slow region. The fast region (less than 800 seconds) corresponds to the easily accessible CaO active sites present on the external surface and the slow region (1000 to 10,000 seconds) corresponds to the penetration of CO2 through the carbonate layer into unreacted CaO near the particle core. The portion of CaO reactivity and kinetics in these two regions depend on the material properties and operating conditions. Decarbonation takes place (>10,000 seconds) when the bed temperature is raised up to 750\ufffd C. or higher. FIG. 24 illustrates that the overall absorption capacity, expressed as a CaO reaction fraction is around 40 mol. % at a time of 10000 seconds. As used herein, the CaO reaction fraction is the ratio of CaO converted to CaCO3 relative to the amount of available absorbent compound (e.g., CaO) in the absorbent material, usually expressed as a mol. %.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{331374=ZnO:NiO (92.5:7.5); 500 g Batch, 71529=It has been proven by van der Ham et al. (Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 1996, 35, 1487) that the H2S content of gas produced by an air- and steam-blown coal gasifier operating under typical conditions can be reduced to 20 ppmv by employing CaO in highly reducing conditions at a temperature higher than 800\ufffd C. Regeneration can be accomplished at a temperature above the absorption temperature by employing a cyclic oxidation and reduction process as is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,083,862 to Wheelock., 284539=This example illustrates the fabrication of a powder batch consisting essentially of a mixture of CaCO3 and CaO:MgO by spray drying and post-processing according to the present invention. 200 g of a powder consisting essentially of CaC2O4:MgC2O4 (calculated CaO:MgO wt. ratio of 80:20, Example A-9) is put into shallow pans, which are then loaded into a convection oven. Under flowing air, the furnace is ramped 10\ufffd C./min to 500\ufffd C., held for 3 hrs and is then cooled to room temperature. The resulting powder batch consists of a mixture of CaCO3 and CaO:MgO., 326741=1.5 kg of Zn(NO3)2.4H2O is dissolved in 3.1 kg de-ionized water. 145 g of CABOSPERSE A2095 and 250 g of DISPAL 23N4-20 is sheared into the Zn(NO3)2.4H2O solution. The resulting 10 wt. % solids precursor solution is fed into a mixed flow spray dryer at a liquid feed rate to maintain inlet/outlet temperatures of 975/580\ufffd F., using a two-fluid nozzle with an air pressure of 65 psig. The residence time of the system is 10 seconds as defined above. The powder is collected using a cyclone., 285267=This example illustrates the fabrication of a mixture of CaCO3 and CaO:MgO by spray drying and post-processing according to the present invention. 200 g of CaC2O4:MgC2O4 (80:20 ratio, Example A-9) is put into shallow pans, which are then loaded into a convection oven. Under flowing air, the furnace is ramped 10\ufffd C./min to 750\ufffd C., held for 3 hrs and is then cooled to room temperature., 325525=1.7 kg of Zn(NO3)2.4H2O is dissolved in 3.1 kg de-ionized water. 145 g of a silica dispersion (CABOSPERSE A2095, a fumed SiO2 available from Cabot Corp., Boston, Mass.) is sheared into the Zn(NO3)2.4H2O solution. The resulting 10 wt. % solids precursor solution is fed into a mixed flow spray dryer at a liquid feed rate to maintain inlet/outlet temperatures of 975/580\ufffd F., using a two-fluid nozzle with an air pressure of 65 psig. The residence time of the system is 10 seconds as defined above. The powder is collected using a cyclone., 189846=The pore sizes of the inter-aggregate pores will typically be in the micron size range and therefore classified as macroporosity. In one embodiment of the present invention, the aggregates are composed of finer sub-particles of the absorbent material that have been aggregated through the spray processing method. The finer sub-particles are derived either from soluble precursors or suspensions of particulate precursors. The preferred size of the smaller primary particles is not greater than about 500 nm, more preferably not greater than about 300 nm and even more preferably not greater than about 100 nm. The primary particles are preferably at least about 10 nm, such as at least about 30 nm in size. As a result, the size of the pores formed between the primary particles in the aggregate are in a similar size range (about 30 nm to 1000 nm) and are classified as mesoporosity. Finally, the primary particles can range from being fully crystalline (i.e., single crystal) to being amorphous. Single crystal sub-particles are likely to be fully dense and exhibit no further porosity, but amorphous particles can include pores that are classified as microporosity. In another embodiment of the present invention, the absorbent particles are composite particles of various amorphous or crystalline metal oxides., 89973=Natural CaO-based absorbents for the absorption of H2S and CO2, such as limestone and dolomite, are plentiful and inexpensive, but they are soft, friable and do not stand up well to handling and use for multiple cycling. To improve- the recyclability, some work has focused on the pelletizing of limestone by using different binders. Work also focused on the modification of natural materials, such as dolomite, to tailor the physicochemical properties of the material. The synthesis of a CaO-based absorbent by boiling of CaO into Ca(OH)2 or the carbonation of calcium salt solution such as calcium nitrate or Ca(OH)2 into calcium carbonate, and subsequent decomposition of the carbonate into CaO is disclosed by L. S. Fan et al., Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 1999, 38, 2283. Others have disclosed the preparation of CaO-based materials by aerogel methods. Other various materials useful for the absorption of H2S are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,729,889 to Flytani-Stephanopoulos et al., the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety., 335258=ZnO:MgO:CuO (82.5:10:7.5); 500 g Batch, 105370=In general, it is believed that the addition of dopants or catalysts can enhance the storage capacity, kinetics, and regenerability of most chemical hydrides. For example, in the case of complex metal hydrides, the addition of a Ti catalyst to sodium alanate (NaAlH4) as described by Bogdanovic and Sandrock (MRS Bulletin, September 2002, pp. 712-716), leads to an increased reversible capacity at 150\ufffd C. In the case of simple metal hydrides, the incorporation of Nb2O5 and other metal oxides into Mg can have a significant effect on the adsorption and desorption kinetics of MgH2. See Barkhordian et al., (Scripta Materialia, 49, (2003), pp. 213-217)., 65233=This application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/723,424, entitled \u201cFUEL REFORMER CATALYST AND ABSORBENT MATERIALS\u201d, filed Nov. 26, 2003 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,267,811. This application also claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/525,462, entitled \u201cPARTICULATE ABSORBENT MATERIALS AND METHODS FOR MAKING SAME\u201d, filed Nov. 26, 2003, and to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/525,467, entitled \u201cCARBON DIOXIDE ABSORBENT MATERIALS AND METHODS FOR MAKING SAME\u201d, filed Nov. 26, 2003. This application is also related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/996,791, entitled \u201cFUEL REFORMER CATALYST AND ABSORBENT MATERIALS\u201d, filed on Nov. 24, 2004, and further identified by Attorney File No. 41890-01736. Each of the foregoing applications is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 332563=ZnO:MgO:NiO (82.5:10:7.5); 500 g Batch, 75336=Other similar materials include aminated carbon molecular sieves, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,810,266 to Zinnen et al., the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Another class of materials are the surface functionalized carbonaceous absorbents described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002/0056686 to Kyrlidis et al., the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, wherein the organic group attached to the surface of the particle comprises one or more amines., 102345=One type of hydrogen storage material is a metal alloy or intermetallic compound that includes a misch metal, often referred to as a misch metal hydride. Typical misch metal compositions include AB, AB2, AB3, AB5 and A2B, where A can be selected from lanthanide elements (e.g., La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Th, Yb and Lu) as well as Mg, Ti and Zr, and B can be selected from the transition elements (e.g., Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Rh, Ru, Pd, Ag, Cd, La, Ce and the like). See Zuttel, Materials Today, September 2003, pp. 24-33, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Preferred examples of such materials include LaNi5, Mg2Ni, Mg2Fe, TiFe, and ZrMn2. For example, LaNi5 forms a species with the empirical formula LaNi5H6.5 and is the material of choice for nickel/metal-hydride batteries. Other examples are given in G. Sandrock, Journal of Alloys and Compounds 293-295 (1999) 877-888, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. These materials have very reliable reversible hydrogen uptake and are currently in use in nickel-metal hydride batteries. These materials are also commonly used for hydrogen storage, but have a low gravimetric hydrogen capacity, between 1 and 3 wt. %. In addition, these materials typically decrepitate after the first adsorption/desorption cycle to form a powder that is pyrophoric when exposed to air., 257381=The present invention can also be applied to fabricate materials for the storage of hydrogen (H2). Safe and economical means for hydrogen storage and delivery a key component for the widespread application of electrochemical devices using hydrogen as a reactant, such as fuel cells. Hydrogen storage materials are described, for example, in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002/0096048 by Cooper et al., which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. However, current H2 storage materials have a low absorption and desorption rate and the particles have a tendency to break down after multiple cycles., 333479=ZnO:MgO:NiO (82.5:10:7.5); 500 g Batch, 332187=ZnO:NiO (92.5:7.5) via Post-Processing, 280159=This example illustrates the fabrication of a 500 g batch of a powder consisting essentially of CaC2O4:MgC2O4 with a calculated CaO:MgO wt. ratio of 50:50 according to the present invention. Individually, 0.92 kg of Ca-nitrate is dissolved in 1.0 kg of de-ionized water, 0.54 kg of NH4-oxalate is dissolved in 2.5 kg of de-ionized water, 1.0 kg of Mg-nitrate (Mg(NO3)2) is dissolved in 1.0 kg of de-ionized water, and 0.56 kg of NH4-oxalate is dissolved in 1.8 kg of de-ionized water. These solutions are shear mixed for 30 minutes. Separately, the nitrate solutions are added to the oxalate solutions. The two resulting dispersions of Ca-oxalate and Mg-oxalate are sheared separately for 1 hour and are then combined. The resulting 10 wt. % solids dispersion of precipitated Ca-oxalates and Mg-oxalates is sheared for an additional hour. The precursor dispersion is fed into a mixed-flow spray dryer at a liquid feed rate to maintain inlet/outlet temperatures of 975\ufffd F./580\ufffd F., using a two-fluid nozzle with an air pressure of 65 psig. The residence time of the system used is 10 seconds, as defined above. The powder is collected using a cyclone and consists essentially of CaC2O4:MgC2O4., 108442=Reversible hydrogen storage materials also include metals, such as Pt, or metal alloys, mixed with or dispersed on the surface of carbon particulates. The carbon particles may also be modified on their surface with organic functional groups to enhance their absorption capability in a number of different ways. Surface. modification helps to selectively bind a catalytically active material, such as a molecular metal-containing complex or a nanometer-sized catalytically active particle, to the surface of the carbon particle. Modified carbon blacks comprising metal particles are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,399,202, 6,280,871, 6,630,268, 6,522,522, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0017379 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0022055, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Surface functional groups also affect the uptake of gaseous species, such as hydrogen, by changing the packing characteristics of the carbon particles, as well as the carbon surface characteristics to be, for example, hydrophobic or hydrophilic. Typical surface function groups include carboxylic acids, sulfonyllic acids, amines and the like. A method by which the surface of the carbon particles can be modified is through reactions with diazonium salts of the desired organic functional groups, as described by Belmont et al. in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,851,280, 6,494,946, 6,042,643, 5,900,029, 5,554,739 and 5,672,198, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 281584=This example illustrates the fabrication of a powder batch consisting of a mixture of CaCO3 and CaO:MgO by spray drying and post-processing according to the present invention. 320 g of a CaC2O4:MgC2O4 powder made on a spray dryer and with a calculated CaO:MgO wt. ratio of 50:50 (Example A-6) is put into shallow pans, which are then loaded into a convection oven. Under flowing air, the furnace is ramped 10\ufffd C./min to 500\ufffd C., held for 3 hours, and is then cooled to room temperature. The resulting powder batch consists essentially of CaCO3 and CaO:MgO., 106904=The most promising hydrogen absorbing materials include carbon particles and carbon nanotubes/fullerenes. These materials may also include hetero atoms which enhance the hydrogen uptake. Such carbon-based materials can also have surface functionalization groups that enhance the capacities and kinetics of hydrogen storage. High surface area active carbons are known to physisorb molecular hydrogen, but only at low temperatures due to the weak nature of the physisorption interaction. Conversely, chemical reaction of hydrogen with carbon (chemisorption) in the form of fullerenes to form hydrocarbons, e.g., C60H48, results in the formation of covalently bonded hydrogen that requires high temperatures to desorb the hydrogen. To resolve this dichotomy, a number of solutions have been explored. A reduction in the chemical stability of the carbon materials may bring the adsorption/desorption kinetics closer to room temperature. Also, single wall carbon nanotubes have dimensions that are close to that required for capillary condensation of hydrogen molecules and may offer an alternative strategy. Finally, the incorporation of metal particles into the structure of the carbon particles may provide another mechanism to bring the reaction conditions closer to more commercially viable conditions. A recent example of such materials is described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002/0096048 by Cooper et al., which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 182779=Current reactive absorbents suffer from a rapid loss of porosity from sintering during multiple temperature swing operations. The materials prepared by conventional methods, such as precipitation or solid-state processing, either lack the desired porosity or the desired crystal size, which are two critical parameters to material performance. An absorbent lacking adequate porosity will result in slow kinetics for both absorption and desorption of the target chemical species. Some research suggests that an average pore size in the range of 5 to 20 nm is less susceptible to pore plugging. (Ghosh-Dastidar, A.; Mahuli, S. K.; Agnihotri, R.; Fan, L.-S. Investigation of High Reactivity Calcium Carbonate Sorbent for Enhanced SO2 Removal. Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 1996, 35 (2), 598). Also, the chemical species gas can only penetrate a thin (about 0.1 \u03bcm) shell of the solid absorbent particle during repeated absorption and desorption cycles, which is less than one-tenth of the normal particle size. Reactive absorbents present in natural and conventional materials generally have a large particle size, low porosity and do not have a three-dimensional pore network structure., 334458=ZnO:CuO (92.5:7.5); 500 g Batch}",
