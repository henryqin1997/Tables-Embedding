            "Often see campus security and campus police patrol the campus and buildings, although the blue light system on campus is only in the parking lots. Every dorm is key card locked so that only those authorized can enter, and after certain times on weekdays and the all day on weekends, classrooms are key card locked so only students, faculty, and staff can enter.",
            "For such a small student body, there are plenty of organizations and activities for students to get involved with. There are numerous service based organizations, as well as club teams for almost every sport!",
            "Hard working and motivated, wants to succeed and also likes to enjoy themselves by hanging out with friends.",
            "Every Tuesday, there is something called College Coffee. Students, Professors, and Faculty all come out and have coffee, juice, pastries, bagels, whatever is out that day. It is a nice time to just chit-chat with professors, and even just have a relaxing talk with the president of the university, or the former president.",
            "Join a club! There are many socially oriented clubs such as sports teams and ballroom dance team. Or get your friends together and do a movie night in a classroom using a projector, there's also a local bowling alley that has unlimited bowling Friday/Saturday nights for $10 for 3 hours!",
            "There are many dining options available, and accommodations for those with special food needs (celiac/ vegetarian). What I don't like is the limited options of meal plans and how quickly the increase in price. Every freshman must have a plan giving unlimited swipes to dining halls, and if they choose to, they can get retail meals, and unless you use at least 6 of your 7 every week (they reset every week) you loose money.",
            "Some dorms are better than others, it all depends on the age of them. Either way, they are nice and spacious, and it is easy to get what you need from residence life staff. The RA's are also very good about coming quickly if someone is locked out or neighbors are being loud during quiet hours.",
            "Classes are amazing, there are many different kinds of classes, and a wide variety of choices to let you pick what you would like to take to fulfill your general requirements. The actual difficulty of classes varies on the professors, although I have found that those with adjuncts are not as good as those with the full-time professors. If you have a choice, choose a full-time Elon professor.",
            "Get involved! There are plenty of clubs on campus that can help you find your niche and your group of amazing friends. Also, don't be afraid to go talk to a professor during their office hours, they are always happy to see you, and I have only ever asked to come back later when a professor is with another student!",
            "Amazing Campus, amazing professors, amazing community. The surrounding areas love Elon students because we do hours and hours of community service with them."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{235046=I transferred to Elon University in the fall of 2013 because I did not enjoy my college experience at my previous college and I wanted to be closer to home for family and personal reasons that I was experiencing at the time. I came to Elon University because the school was in my hometown. The first week I fell in love with Elon University and its beautiful campus, the other students, and the professors. The classes were exceptional and I really enjoyed my learning experience. I would definitely recommend Elon University to anyone who wants a personal learning experience that is close to fellow students and professors., 157544=The best Elon tradition is Leo Lambert\u00c3\u00a2??s, our president\u00c3\u00a2??s, Holiday party. He invites all students to his house, the week before winter break, for a Christmas party. There is great food, caroling and you can wait in line to have your picture taken with Leo. THEN he mails it home to your family in a Christmas card. Such a good PR move! Another fun Holiday tradition is the luminaries, when all the campus comes out for free hot chocolate, caroling, and the lighting of the campus. It's always a fun way to wrap up the fall semester and welcome the holidays. Unusual - West Dormitory is said to be haunted! Although I lived there and never had any ghostly experiences, it's an ongoing legend that Mary haunts 3rd floor West. It is said that she jumped out a window when escaping the great fire - HOWEVER this legend does not make sense since West Dormitory is supposed to be the only building to have survived the fire of 1923. But nevertheless, the stories continue and it's fun to blame her when weird stuff happens. If you make it up in time for brunch Saturday or Sunday morning, you'll see the maintenance staff hard at work replacing bricks. Bricks that had been stolen the night before. I guess it's an Elon tradition to steel a brick at one point or another - it is quite the nuisance for cyclists or walkers who trip before poor maintenance has time to replace them all!, 176191=There is a driving range (golf) on campus as well as a couple of lakes. One tradition that should be returning, when construction of the new dorms is done, is the Polar Bear Plunge, which give students the opportunity to jump into one of the lakes in January or February. We also have a non-Greek event called Festivus, at which students get together and play/wrestle in a giant mud puddle., 23122=elon university has three dinning halls which are, harden, mcewen, and colonades. there are also retail locations such as boars head, pan geos, varsity sports and grill, and 1889. there are a great selection of choices from salads, pastas, chicken, burgers and soups. there's many gluten free and healthier options for those who cannot eat gluten. the only concern would be that the if you go to lets say mcewen everyday, then you'll get bored of the same food. try to variate between the other dinning halls because eventually you'll get tired of eating the same thing., 141501=There is Luminaries every December, which is where there is available cider and cocoa, caroling, and the lighting of the Christmas lights on the trees. The Turning 21 Dinner is another big hit, where students are able to invite a professor or mentor to a dinner hosted by Elon in celebration of their 21st birthday., 244758=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 21119=at elon university, there has been the tradition of the polar bear plunge in which all elon students during their winter term classes dive into the university's lake mary neil's cold waters and retrieve a gift card. also there's an event called turkey trot every november in which elon students are able to run or walk a few miles in honor of the thanksgiving holidays., 55050=There are many lovely traditions at Elon. The first one that comes to mind is the tradition that takes place at convocation and commencement. At freshman convocation, the fledgling students are given an acorn to symbolize that they are planting the seeds of education, as well as beginning their journey of growth and learning--all of which takes place at Elon, which is Jewish for oak tree! Then, upon graduation students are given an oak sapling to plant and continue their growth in the world outside of college. This is very endearing and unique, especially since Elon's botanical garden campus is famous for the stunning oak trees abound. In addition to this tradition, there is a darker one that takes place on campus. Furthermore, one of the buildings known as West Dormitory is believed to be haunted! Students maintain that Mary, a victim of the fire that burned down most of the campus in 1923, can be seen flickering lights and swinging from the chandelier in the dormitory parlor! In the evenings students gather in the parlor in hopes of seeing the frightening, yet beloved ghost., 145128=The most beautiful and welcoming campus I have visited. I absolutely love this school. Can't wait to attend Fall of 2013}",

While there are some professors that like to lecture, most professors enjoy teaching you some and then giving you the opportunity to test out what you have learned! Also, the professors WILL get to know your name, so if you don't want to be another face in the crowd or a number, Elon is perfect for you! Tips for prospective students I encourage you too definetely visit the campus, and when you do make an appointment with some professors in any areas that you are interested in, take a tour or two, and sit in on some classes. Don't be afraid to talk to some of the students about anything you want to know about Elon. The students are the insiders and will be more than willing to let you in on some secrets!",
