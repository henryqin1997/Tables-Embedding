The Double Room is of a generous size, with two comfortable chairs, an antique wardrobe, a small dressing table, as well as the usual hospitality tray and a TV. It also enjoys magnificant views across the valley and is pleasantly light and airy. The bathroom is almost as big as the bedroom!\u2026 with a large victorian bath and further wash basin; and the toilet is seperate, but both are ensuit and off your own private lobby. A Small Twin is next door, and is ideal for children or family friends as they needs to share the en suit facilities of the double room (but can also access a shower room).
