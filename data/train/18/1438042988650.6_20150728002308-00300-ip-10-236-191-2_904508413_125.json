That said, you may have to take out loans if you do not get sufficient financial aid (this happens especially if you live in on-campus housing). My loans have averaged $1000 per semester. Also, the quality of education will depend on the department/major you are in. The Education department and Nursing programs have notable and excellent programs, while some others are very lacking in terms of instructor quality and rigor., 700862=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 10966=Expect cold weather in October, but mostly expect amazing unity. The IUP campus is big and holds 14,000 students, but you feel so involved when you are here. Whether you join the paper or just play frisbee with friends in the Oak Grove, you will see how unified the students are.}",

There are also some interesting stores along with the Jimmy Stewart Museum on Philadelphia Street in downtown Indiana. Food and Dining The quality of the food depends on where you go. Fosters Dining Hall's food isn't so great, but it is buffet style. The HUB (our student union) has a make-your-own pasta and salad places along with a hamburger place, Chick-Fil-A, and a sandwich shop. Folgers Dining Hall has a pizza place, a wrap station, oriental food, home foods, Quiznos, and Starbucks. You can used meal swipes at most places and flex to cover the rest. Dorm Life The suites are brand new! You can have your own bedroom, the kitchens are furnished with a microwave and mini-fridge, and you have a bathroom located in your suite. You are spoiled at IUP as far as dorming goes. Academic Rigor I have found most of my classes to be fairly moderate in the difficulty and workload. English 101 is killer, some",
