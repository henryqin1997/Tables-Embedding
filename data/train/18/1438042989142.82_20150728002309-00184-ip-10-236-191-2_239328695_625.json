This weight compensates for the unequal probabilities of selection for respondents in different size households and for different non-response across geographic sample design categories. A post stratification adjustment used the 2000 CPS March Supplement estimates as the standard. The cells were formed by crossing 6 age groups by 4 levels of education. The age groups were: 18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70+. The education levels were: lt high school graduation, high school graduate, some college, and 4 years of college or more.
