This process results in the pH of the water dropping to about 4. At this point, approximately 333 ml of the carbonated water was decanted into a plastic bottle and 333 square inches of nanocrystalline silver-coated net was added to the water. The nanocrystalline silver-coated net and water were placed in 37\ufffd C. shaker incubator and shaken at 180 RPM for 30 minutes to elevate the pH to approximately 5.8. The solution was then transferred to a beaker and stirred vigorously for 2 minutes to raise the pH to approximately at 7.3. The solution had a final silver concentration of approximately 400 ppm., 48828=[0033] In general, clusters refer to relatively small groups of atoms, ions or the like. For example, a cluster can contain at least two (e.g., at least three, at least four, at least five, at least six, at least seven, at least eight, at least nine, at least 10, at least 11, at least 12, at least 13, at least 14, at least 15, at least 20, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, at least 60, at least 70, at least 80, at least 90) atoms, ions or the like, and/or at most 1,000 (e.g., at most 900, at most 800, at most 700, at most 600, at most 500, at most 400, at most 300, at most 200, at most 100) atoms, ions or the like. Clusters are described, for example, in R. P. Andres et al., \u201cResearch Opportunities on Cluster and Cluster-Assembled Materials\u201d, J. Mater. Res. Vol. 4, No 3, 1989, p. 704. In certain embodiments, a cluster (e.g., a cluster containing silver) can contain less than the 14 atoms and have a normal face centered cubic crystal lattice., 297398=[0317] This example and Example 4 above, taken together with the evidence that the silver materials herein disclosed are capable of reducing inflammation (see co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 10/131,568; 10/131,511; 10/131,509; 10/131,513; and 10/128,208 filed Apr. 23, 2002; and co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/840,637 filed Apr. 23, 2001, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/285,884 filed Apr. 23, 2001) demonstrates a method of reducing inflammation in a patient in need thereof, by contacting an area of inflammation or an inflammatory cell with a therapeutically effective amount of the antimicrobial metals in a crystalline form. The antimicrobial metals are characterized by sufficient atomic disorder, such that the metal, in contact with an alcohol or water-based electrolyte, releases atoms, ions, molecules, or clusters of at least one antimicrobial metal at a concentration sufficient to modulate the release of one or both of MMP-9 and TNF-\u03b1. Excessive TNF production has been reported in diseases, such as cancer and autoimmune diseases, which are characterized by elevated MMP activity. In this regard, use of the nanocrystalline silver of the present invention, when in therapeutically effective amounts, provides the dual modulation of MMP-9 and TNF-\u03b1 to alleviate the particular condition., 207308=[0219] The bacteria used for infection of these animals were Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain 579. The dose was previously titrated to ascertain that a dose of up to 1010 CFU was not lethal for the animals. The bacteria were grown overnight in Tryptic soy broth, washed once in sterile PBS, and re-suspended in a {fraction (1/10)} volume of sterile PBS., 39278=[0001] This application is a continuation-in-part and claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd120 of: U.S. patent application Ser.

The bacterial strains were grown under appropriate conditions overnight prior to the day of surgery. On the morning of surgery, the organisms were washed with sterile water and resuspended to a final density of approximately 107 CFU/mL. The bacteria were mixed together in a ratio of 1:0.5:1 (Pseudomonas:CNS:Fusobacterium) in water. Sufficient inoculum was prepared to wet the incision created in each experiment. This procedure resulted in the incisions initially being evenly contaminated with approximately 8\ufffd104 CFU/cm2., 219286=[0232] A solution form nanocrystalline silver coated dressings (AgHDPE) from Example 1 was prepared by sparging CO2 through 1000 ml of reverse osmosis water using commercial CO2 Soda Syphon Charger. This process resulted in the pH of the water dropping to about 4. At this point, approximately 333 ml of the carbonated water was decanted into a plastic bottle and 333 square inches of nanocrystalline silver-coated net was added to the water. The nanocrystalline silver-coated net and water were placed in 37\ufffd C. shaker incubator and shaken at 180 RPM for 30 minutes to elevate the pH to approximately 5.8. The solution was then transferred to a beaker and stirred vigorously for 2 minutes to raise the pH to approximately at 7.3. The dissolution solution was transferred to a commercial nebulizer which was connected to a medical air cylinder with a flow rate of approx. 20 L/min. The outflow of the nebulizer was connected to a animal chamber housing the rats to be dosed. Only the \u201ctest\u201d rats (12 randomly assigned animals) received the dosing. The rats received two-\ufffd hour aerosol administrations of the test solution on the day of infection. Thereafter, the test rats were dosed 3 times per day for an additional one and a half days., 136382=[0144] A commercial carboxymethyl cellulose/pectin (Duoderm Convatec\u2122) was combined with nanocrystalline silver powder prepared as in Example 2 to produce a gel with 0.1% w/v. silver. Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) fibers were coated by magnetron sputtering, under conditions similar to those set out in Example 1 for the top layer to produce a defective nanocrystalline silver coating. The CMC was then gelled in water by adding 2.9 g to 100 mL volume. An alginate fibrous substrate was directly coated with a defective nanocrystalline silver coating by magnetron sputtering under coating conditions similar to those set forth in Example 1 for the top layer. The alginate (5.7 g) was added to 100 mL volume of water to create a gel. A commercial gel containing CMC and alginate (Purilon gel Coloplast\u2122) was mixed with an atomic disordered nanocrystalline silver powder prepared as in Example 2 to give a gel product with 0.1% w/v silver. A commercially available gel (Lubriderm\u2122\u2014glyceryl polymethacrylate) was blended with atomic disordered nanocrystalline silver powder prepared as in Example 2, to prepare a gel with a silver content of 0.1% w/v. A further gel was formulated with, on w/v basis, 0.1% methyl paraben, 0.02% propyl paraben, 0.5% polyvinyl alcohol (Airvol\u2122 PVA 540), 2% CMC, 0.1% nanocrystalline silver powder prepared as in Example 2, and was brought up to 1000 g with water.}",
