    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{96784=As shown in FIGS. 3 to 8, a method and device for processing the dedicated control channel (DCCH) newly added in the CDMA-2000 system is never defined in the existing standard. Therefore, a frame transmitted over the forward and reverse DCCHs between the BSC and the BTS is not defined and how to perform power control through the DCCH while the DCCH is in use, is also not defined., 109113=Referring to FIG. 10A, the BTS determines in step 101 whether a radio resource to the MS is secured and the MS is acquired. If it is determined in step 101 that the BTS fails to secure the radio resource to the MS and acquire the MS, the BTS decides in step 104 that it is needs to be presently synchronized with the MS in the reverse direction, and sets the rate set indicator or the DCCH frame contents out of the message shown in FIG. 6 to an idle frame in order to acquire synchronization even between the BSC-SDU function block and the BTS. Since synchronization between the BSC-SDU function block and the BTS is being acquired, the BTS sets the BSC-SDU function block to ignore the power control-related information in the DCCH reverse message to be transmitted to the BSC-SDU function block, in step 106. In step 107, the IS-2000 FCH/DCCH reverse message having the frame format shown in FIG. 6 is generated and the generated DCCH reverse message is transmitted to the BSC-SDU function block., 110167=Otherwise, if it is determined in step 101 that the BTS secures the radio resource to the MS and acquires the MS, the BTS examines a quality of the data frame received from the MS in step 102. If it is determined in step 102 that the received data frame has a low quality, the BTS sets the rate set indicator or the DCCH frame contents out of the message shown in FIG. 6 to an erasure frame in step 104-1. After the step 104-1, the BTS sets the BSC-SDU function block to ignore the power control-related information in the DCCH reverse message to be transmitted to the BSC-SDU function block, in step 106-1. In step 107-1, since the frame received from the MS has a low quality, the BTS generates the IS-2000 FCH/DCCH reverse frame message with no data, and transmits the generated FCH/DCCH reverse message to the BSC-SDU function block. The BSC-SDU function block then recognizes the erasure frame and requests power-up of the MS for reverse power control. That is, since the data frame received from the MS has a low quality, the BSC-SDU function block requests the MS to transmit the data frame at increased transmission power., 24020=Existing CDMA mobile communication systems have mainly provided voice service. However, in the near future, CDMA mobile communication systems will support the IMT-2000 (International Mobile Telecommunication-2000) standard which can provide data service as well as voice service. The IMT-2000 mobile communication system can support high-quality voice service, moving picture service and Internet search service., 111939=In step 104-2, the BTS sets the rate set indicator shown in FIG. 6 to the Rate Set 1 (9600 bps) or the Rate Set 2 (14400 bps). Thereafter, the BTS determines in step 105A whether the DCCH forward message frame last received from the BSC-SDU function block is a null frame or not. If the last received forward message is not a null frame, the BTS sets the power control-related information element using the DCCH frame received from the MS in step 106-2. Otherwise, when the last received forward message is a null frame, the BTS ignores the power control information in the DCCH reverse message to be transmitted to the BSC-SDU function block from the 20 ms long data frame received from the MS, and sets the BSC-SDU function block to ignore the information element indicating the power control information, in step 106-3. The air frames of DCCH on the forward/reverse direction are sent every 20 ms with frames including all available data of 20 ms period. After either step 106-2 or step 106-3, the BTS encapsulates the data included in the 20 ms frame received from the MS to generate the IS-2000 FCH/DCCH reverse frame having the format shown in FIG. 6 and transmits the generated IS-2000 DCCH reverse message to the BSC-SDU function block, in step 107-2. The data received from the MS is transmitted to the BSC-SDU function block by being loaded in the channel information field shown in FIG. 6., 113464=When the DTX mode is detected in step 103, the process jumps to FIG. 10B, where the BTS sets the IS-2000 DCCH frame contents shown in FIG. 6 to the null frame in step 104-3. That is, the BTS sets the rate set indicator information element shown in FIG. 6 to the null frame. After the step 104-3, the BTS performs step 105B which is identical to step 105A performed after the step 104-2 on FIG. 10A. In step 105B, the BTS determines whether the DCCH forward message last received from the BSC-SDU function block is a null frame or not. If the DCCH forward message last received from the BSC-SDU function block is not a null frame, the BTS sets the power control information at the time point where the DTX mode is detected, to the power control-related information element, in step 106-4. Otherwise, when the DCCH forward message last received from the BSC-SDU function block is a null frame, the BTS ignores all the power control-related information at the time point where the DTX mode is detected, out of the power control information of the DCCH reverse message, shown in FIG. 6, to be transmitted to the BSC-SDU function block, and sets the BSC-SDU function block to ignore the power control information element, in step 106-5. After either step 106-4 or step 106-5, since there is no data in the 20 ms frame received from the MS, the BTS generates the IS-2000 FCH/DCCH reverse frame format with no data, shown in FIG. 6, and transmits the generated IS-2000 FCH/DCCH reverse message to the BSC-SDU function block. At this point, the channel information shown in FIG. 6 is transmitted to the BSC-SDU function block with no data filled therein., 23416=This application claims the benefit of Provisional application Ser. No. 60/133,790, filed May 12, 1999., 81174=A \u201cReverse Traffic Channel Information\u201d field indicates reverse traffic channel information that the BTS has received from the MS. The \u201cReverse Traffic Channel Information\u201d field includes the number of information bits per frame, shown in Table 11 below, according to the rate sets. For example, for the Rate Set 1, when the transmission rate is 9600 bps, the number of information bits per frame is 172; and when the transmission rate is 1200 bps, the number of information bits per frame is 16. For the Rate Set 2, when the transmission rate is 14400 bps, the number of information bits per frame is 267; and when the transmission rate is 3600 bps, the number of information bits per frame is 55.}",

As described above, an embodiment of the present invention can transmit and receive signals between a base station transceiver system (BTS) and a base station controller (BSC) over the dedicated control channel (DCCH) even in discontinuous transmission (DTX) mode, by considering the DTX mode and the DCCH which were not conventionally considered in the base station of the mobile communication system. According to the definitions shown in Tables 13 to 17, in the forward direction, when there is no data to be transmitted from the BSC-SDU function block to the BTS, power control is performed using the power control field only. In the reverse direction, power control can be performed in the same manner as in the pre-null frame state in the MS acquisition state (i.e., a state where the dedicated code channel is assigned and synchronization acquired). Therefore, it is possible to support the DTX mode of the physical channel. Referring to Table 17, the Layer-3 Fill information of the information elements of the reverse layer-3 data further indicates the underlined null frame field, as compared with Table 12.
