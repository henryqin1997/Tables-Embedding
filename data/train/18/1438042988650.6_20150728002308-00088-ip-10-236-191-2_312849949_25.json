In Sep-Oct 2012, Funai started having problems they traced to their redesigned\u00a0OEM power supply (PS). That required a change in the 533 and 535 models to\u00a02-1/2\" HDDs, which draw much less power (+5V vs +12V peak),\u00a0so it would be wise to use a similar 2-1/2\" HDD as a replacement or upgrade in a 533 or 535 model (or a 537 for that matter)., 200187=gm2040 used Scottypa's procedural steps as a guide but cut 3 louvers in the intake air vent on the side and bent them back for his external cable.

Personally, if choices and budget permit, I'd look for drives that specify they're for \"AV\" or \"DVR\" operation, esp. for the 2160/2160A/513/515/53x/557, which are *always* auto-recording.

Obviously, you should do similar tests and determine for yourself what's right for your current system, future plans and \"pixel sensitivity.\" Just remember, to make natural 16:9 WS recordings from a digital channel thru the tuner or an external input, you have to set the DVDR Aspect for 16:9 Wide, and those programs will ONLY be on digital channels, never on analog channels.

The coax in/out loop delivers and slightly amplifies whatever signal is fed in, including hi-def TV (HDTV) in its native,full-screen form, directly to your TV and other downstream components, even when this DVDR is off. NOTHING internal from this DVDR (menus, channels, HDD titles, DVDs) is sent thru the coax. On a separate internal path, the incoming RF/coax signal is slightly amplified and fed to this DVDR's std def. (SDTV) tuner. This allows you to watch your normal HD on your TV AND record on this DVDR at the same time. However, this DVDR... and ALL SDTV DVD recorders in North America... downrezzes the HDTV signal path that goes thru its tuner or line inputs so it can record in 480i as required by the SDTV DVD-Video standard. For watching DVDR channels or recordings on your TV, the downrezzed signal can be converted to 480p thru Component and HDMI, or converted and uprezzed to 720p, 1080i or 1080p thru HDMI, if desired.

Skip Rant] You'll hear all sorts of opinions on WS but, just remember, EVERYBODY HAS ONE! I've read LOTS of stuff on widescreen and aspects and I've yet to read anything that's SIMPLE. I've also read LOTS of posts in AVS trying to explain this crap. Some of them argue that our std def resolutions of 352x480 and 720x480 define the dimensions of our recorded pics. Others try to correlate the pixel ratio to 4:3 or 16:9 Display Aspect. It's neither and it's not that simple! For our DVDR purposes, this Wiki article on Aspect Ratio explains the distinctions and even formulas () between Display Aspect Ratio (DAR, 4:3 or 16:9), Stored Aspect Ratio (SAR, 720x480 & others), and Pixel Aspect Ratio (PAR, square/non-square), which have to fit within the 4:3 frame required by the DVD Standard. Repeat: the 4:3 frame REQUIRED by the DVD Std. This Wiki article on \"anamorphic\" WS helps explain: (1) why our DVDRs must record all content \"as 4:3\" (DVD std is based on VHS std which is 4:3), and (2) how a combination of square/non-square pixels, variable horiz. rez, compression and decompression allowed by the DVD std are the \"keys to enlightenment\" since they explain how our DVDRs can fill a 4:3 frame with non-square (rectangular) pixels, allowing our HDTV's aspect control to stretch the 4:3 frame to glorious 16:9 WS. And what is \"anamorphic\" you say? More technical crap but, in the simplest of terms, it means \"squeezing and stretching.\" This is how our std def recorders fit a WS show into their 4:3 aspect frame. Based on anamorphic data in the video stream, our HDTV's have the OPTION to stretch that recording into a natural 16:9 image with true 16:9 pixel aspect. Another OPTION is to letterbox the recording when played back for proper aspect on a 4:3 TV. However, these DVDRs, and many others in N.A., DO NOT GIVE US THE ANAMORPHIC DISPLAY OPTION! So, once you record digital 16:9 WS shows with these DVDRs, at any rec mode, they will always be sent to your TV in 16:9 full-screen Display Aspect, and you can only MIS-shape them by playing them to a 4:3 TV (squeezing the pic horizontally) or changing the TV's aspect from its required \"Wide\" 16:9 format to any of its other formats or \"viewing modes\" like \"Normal\" or 4:3... which, by the way, should NOT be anything with the word \"native\" in it since \"native\" for DVD is a 4:3 frame as explained above! If you've stuck with me thus far, you need to know that the discussion below is just about RESULTS that I personally see in my daily recordings and specific WS tests. I don't care if this DVDR sets an American, Chinese or Kyrgyzstanian flag in WS recordings! I'll leave the technical details to others cuz IDGAS! As long as this DVDR records both digital WS and analog 4:3 shows in a way that preserves their natural shapes on the HDD and in DVDs and displays them NICELY on 16:9 and 4:3 TVs FROM DIFFERENT PLAYERS, IRDGAS!! Also, there are MANY set-top boxes (STB) that will NOT send a WS signal thru their Composite or S-Video outputs, so there's no way to get that signal to this DVDR in WS format w/o an intermediary filter/converter... and it's NOT cuz this DVDR can't record WS! And, did I mention, IRRDGAS!!! [End Rant] Go back to List. ......

If you go this route, make sure you get a Dock that fits both 2.5\" and 3.5\" drives. You only need 5400rpm drives in any Philips or Mag unit., 486036=This DVDR WILL record WS programs on digital channels thru the tuner, line inputs (E1/L1, E2/L2), and DV input (E3/L3) if you set the DVDR Aspect to 16:9 Wide AND the source sends a WS signal. (See this report on recording WS from the E3 (DV) input on a 3575.) The DEFAULT setting is 4:3 Letter Box. if you leave it there and later get a 16:9 TV, your current WS recordings will all be squished by LB bars so people will look wider than normal and circles will be flattened ovals... and you'll be royally pissed-off!? Significantly, this DVDR's Aspect setting is in the Video menu, NOT the Playback menu like it is in some other DVDRs, incl. the Pio 53x/63x/640. This setting determines the pic format you VIEW AND RECORD from a digital channel or other WS source... i.e., YOU can control the recorded aspect! It also allows you to change a commercial WS movie's aspect to 4:3 Letter Box on playback if it has \"Enhanced for Widescreen,\" \"Anamorphic Widescreen\" or similar notation on the case. This DVDR's Aspect setting is extremely valuable for recording cuz it makes this DVDR a WYSIWYG machine: What You See Is What You Get. That is, you can SEE what pic format this DVDR will record FROM ANY SOURCE (TV, camera, STB, etc.) in advance by setting or changing its DVDR Aspect and viewing the pic being fed thru the DVDR to your WS TV. I've noticed that sometimes a change in my 3575's Aspect setting doesn't \"take\"... the pic hangs on its last aspect and takes a 2nd or even 3rd try at toggling the checkmark to a new aspect setting. If working correctly, once you press the SETUP button to exit the aspect setting menu, the pic should \"pop\" into its new shape, i.e., you should see a change in aspect almost immediately, but again, only on a digital channel. You can set your DVDR Aspect for 16:9 Wide for ALL your recordings, as I do, no matter which type of TV you have now. Note: Some HDTV's won't properly upscale a 16:9 WS pic sent by this DVDR using HDMI set for 480p. If you can't seem to see or record WS pics thru this DVDR using HDMI, change the format with the HDMI button to all those available and see if your HDTV needs one or mote specific HDMI settings to show a true WS pic. This DVDR doesn't set the \"WS flag,\" which means its DVDs won't be \"anamorphic WS\" like commercial DVDs, which play perfectly on 16:9 TVs and can be changed to 4:3 LB when played to a 4:3 TV. HOWEVER, I've done many tests and regular daily recordings with my 3575 Aspect set for 16:9 Wide and played them to 16:9 and 4:3 TVs on DIFFERENT brands of players/recorders and, so far, ALL my recordings play back nicely and full-screen from my 3575, Pio 640 and Panny combo... WITHOUT THE \"WS FLAG\"! More importantly, this DVDR's WS recordings dubbed to DVD discs will show true WS on virtually any other brand of player/recorder, unlike some -RAM machines that produce DVD\u00b1R discs that only play as WS in the same brand of machine. Also, I simply cannot get the \"tall & skinny\" people that others report with their DVDRs when recording a natural 16:9 WS program on a digital channel. With the natural 16:9 WS programs I've recorded with DVDR Aspect set for 16:9 Wide, I can only detect a VERY SLIGHT squeeze when played back on a 3575, Pio 640 and Panny combo to a 4:3 TV... and that's only noticeable cuz I'm recording a WS channel with a circle logo (TNT)... people look OK. I did see one odd-aspect program that produced a taller/skinnier image than I was used to, but it was NOT a natural 16:9 WS program... this might be what others are recording when they say they get grossly tall and skinny people on 4:3 TVs? A program on a WS digital channel with side bars (pillar bars), a \"postage-stamp\" pic with bars all around, or 2:35 movie could produce an odd-aspect WS recording that shows \"funny\" on any TV type., 264865=IdleW (power used during idle) is essentially irrelevant to the 2160 and MDR series of DVDRs since they are seldom in an idle state... they're almost always auto-recording in the background. Thus, OpW (power during typical user ops) is the only power stat of real interest or consequence to a 2160A/MDR user.

IdleW (power used during idle) is essentially irrelevant to the 2160 and MDR series of DVDRs since they are seldom in an idle state... they're almost always auto-recording in the background.

HC=Hitachi CinemaStar, 480670=To all old VCR users and analog cable TV subscribers like me: Welcome to the brave, but wild, new world of WS TV! You're in for a treat... a trick, cuz your TV-watching-recording life just got more complicated! There are many signal and aspect-ratio combinations this DVDR can display and record with its NTSC and ATSC/QAM tuners: the old std 4:3 we're all familiar with, but now, with your new HDTV, you'll also see 4:3 pillarboxed (PB, black bar on each side), 4:3 letterboxed (LB, black bar top and bottom), 4:3 PB+LB (\"postage-stamp\"), and natural full-screen 16:9 WS. However, it all depends on the original production aspect used, your signal source (analog or digital), channel, station, service provider, type of TV you have for display, your Video > TV Aspect setting in this DVDR, AND finally the aspect (TV format) you've selected in your HDTV viewing settings... just a few things like that! All ANALOG channels show only 4:3 formatted programs (with rare exceptions of simulcast analog/digital HD-produced news programs). ANALOG channels will be full-screen (FS) 4:3 on a 4:3 TV. A 16:9 TV will add PB bars if the TV is set for \"Normal\" but Wide, Pan or Zoom TV settings will spread the 4:3 pic to fill the screen (with some loss of PQ because the pixels are square!). This DVDR's aspect setting has NO EFFECT whatsoever on ANALOG channels or your VHS tapes. They will ALWAYS record in 4:3 aspect... only a 16:9 TV can change the appearance/aspect of ANALOG channels and recordings from them. On the other hand, DIGITAL channels can show programs produced in 4:3 AR AND 16:9 AR, but luckily, when a 4:3 program is broadcast on a DIGITAL channel, it comes prepackaged with PB sidebars necessary to display in its natural 4:3 aspect. Some combinations of DVDR and TV setting can produce a \"postage stamp\" in the center of the screen, with bars all around., 483707=With DIGITAL channels, this DVDR's TV Aspect setting DOES affect the AR of the pic. To avoid any AR problems with recordings from my DIGITAL channels, I record everything on 16:9 Wide and set my LCD HDTV for Wide, which stretches the pic on ANALOG recordings but displays WS DIGITAL recordings in their normal AR as they're broadcast.\u00a0I almost NEVER record 4:3 programs, so occasional stretching is easily tolerated to assure seeing digital 16:9 WS in all its glory!, 239504=Sep 2013: Many AVS members are currently using Western Digital AV-GP drives in their HD DVRs, here's a 500GB WD5000AUDX drive in that series that should work well in the 513?

On my 16:9 LCD TV set for Wide and DVDR set for 16:9 Wide, I just watched and recorded a local news break and lead-ins to the show in 4:3 PB, which led to several commercials alternating between PB and PB+LB, which led to the Idol show broadcast in 16:9 WS \"Digital High Definition\"... and back and forth for the next hour! It was a fascinating display of aspect ratio variations and, to a vidiot like me, almost a show in itself! Go back to List. ...... Go to main list of help files.

All these boxes will output a true WS pic thru their HDMI and RGB connections, but many will letterbox the WS output from their Composite/S-Vid connections (i.e., add bars to reshape the pic for a 4:3 TV).. A \"true WS\" pic is one that's produced in WS and transmitted that way, not a 4:3 image stretched by your TV, some of which can look \"pretty good\"... except for the long noses! In addition, your DVDR can only record signals it receives thru a line input (L1/E1, L2/E2) if those signals are in 480i (interlaced) format. Some devices auto-convert a signal to 480i if sent thru a Composite/S-Vid output, and some have to be SET to do that. You can check your STB/DVR by connecting it directly to your TV with Composite Yellow or S-Video video cable and seeing what it delivers to the TV when the TV is set to its \"Wide\" setting (name depends on TV). If your STB/DVR has settings for output format, try it with and without changing that setting to 480i. IF your STB/DVR outputs true WS thru Composite Yellow or S-Video, with or without a 480i setting, you're good to go! You can set it to deliver that pic to your DVDR and the recorded image will be in true 16:9 WS aspect ratio, assuming you also set your DVDR for \"16:9 Wide\" in the Video > TV Aspect menu and your TV on its \"Wide\" setting. IF your STB/DVR does NOT output true WS thru Composite Yellow or S-Vid, you'll need either a diff. STB/DVR or a HDMI-to-Composite/S-Video or Component-to-Composite/S-Video Converter... some are listed here. Here's a table of some STB/DVRs that either WILL or WON'T send a recordable WS signal thru their Composite or S-Video outputs:, 69836=Funai History Forget everything you've been told or thought you knew about Philips and Magnavox standard-definition (SD) DVD recorders (DVDR). In 2007, Philips (designer) and Funai (manufacturer) introduced the first of EIGHT generations of nearly identical HDD/DVD recorders that represent a new and better breed: the DVDR3575H/37. THE 3575 WAS THE ONLY RECORDER INTRODUCED IN N.A. IN 2007 WITH BOTH HARD DISK DRIVE (HDD) AND DIGITAL TUNERS TO COMPLY WITH U.S. RULES FOR THE DIGITAL TRANSITION. This \"feat\" didn't seem too big a deal until it won a CES 2008 Innovation Award! Imagine that, Philips/Funai gaining notoriety (and envy) for being on the leading edge for once... and all by itself! In Sep 2012, Funai introduced its 8th generation of HDD/DVD recorders: the MDR53x Series (533, 535, 537). Each gen gets better with each update... instead of being \"swept into the trashbin of history by Panasonic\" as predicted by a desperate and envious Panny super-fanboy in 2007! He's now rootin' around in that trashbin to see if he can find a rusty old Panasonic HDD recorder... you know, the ones they introduced in 2008 that swept the Philips away... right into the history book of Dynasties!\u00a0He finally had to settle for a dusty-old Mag 515, a 7th Generation Funai HDD/DVD model introduced \"way back\" in 2010! Philips owns the Magnavox brand name everywhere except Australia and licensed its use to Funai until 2017. As noted at the bottom of the Magnavox website, \"MAGNAVOX is a registered trademark of Philips Electronics North America Corporation and is used by Funai Electric Co. Ltd. and Funai Corporation, Inc. under license from Philips Electronics North America Corporation.\" Funai manufactures all of these HDD/DVD recorders in China. It has its own factory and supervisory personnel in China, where it currently produces the VAST majority of ALL DVDRs sold in North America under various brand names, including, but not limited to, Funai, Philips, Magnavox, and Toshiba. A short profile of Funai here explains how it became one of Walmart's \"Strategic Vendors\" in 1999 after it delivered 1 million Emerson VCRs for a Walmart \"Early Bird\" promotion, and how Funai is \"one of the few fully integrated operations capable of producing nearly all of the parts and components of its products in-house,\" which enhances its price advantage over competitors. Another price advantage is Funai's Strategic Vendor status with Walmart and possibly others. Funai builds a bunch of units and the sellers buy them in shipping containers \"on dock\" in China, where Funai's factory is, so Funai has virtually no shipping, marketing or advertising cost. (I believe they think \"marketing\" has something to do with groceries?) A Wiki profile: Funai Electric is a Japanese consumer electronics company headquartered in Dait\u014d, Osaka, Japan. The company was founded in 1961. It owns the subsidiary Funai Corporation, Inc., established in the United States since 1991, to market and maintain Funai-licensed brands such as Sylvania, Emerson Radio, Magnavox, Philips, Pye, and Symphonic. Funai is also the main OEM manufacturer providing assembled televisions and video players/recorders to major corporations such as Sharp, Toshiba, Denon, etc. Funai also manufactures printers for Dell and Lexmark, as well as digital cameras for Kodak., 201838=General Info These DVDRs allow recording, storage, and playback with multiple external \"dock-and-play\" HDDs, making these DVDRs more versatile than any other SDTV recorder in N.A., and even some HDTV DVRs. This is the way to go for a \"HDD farm\" if a user has multiple HDDs he/she wants to swap out on a \"regular\" basis since you don't have to fool with a plug-and-play cables at all... it's a simple dock-and-play. Auskck replaced his 3575 and 3576 internal 160GB Seagate PATA drives with an external enclosure and \"Toaster\" (docking station or hard drive dock) for swapping FIVE SATA drives on and between the DVDRs... a \"dock-and-play HDD farm.\" Others have even more HDDs in their \"farms\" and swap between Philips and Mag HDD DVDRs. A multi-bay enclosure like that shown in Auskck's pic above protects inactive drives and provides the 5V/12V power reqd for the active 2.5\" or 3.5\" HDD in the dock, reducing the recorder's internal heat and the HDD's stress on the recorder's power supply and circuits. Drive swaps take Auskck less than 1 min. cuz he turns his 3575 and 3576 off to make the drive swap. That method apparently allows the machine to boot up in a normal manner, check for a good HDD and make it immediately recordable or playable with no further user action. gm2040's single-enclosure approach mentioned above shuts the external drive down when he turns off the DVDR and turns it back on again when he powers back up. Drive FW is NOT installed on the HDD, and previously used HDDs are NOT auto-formatted when connected (like in some other recorders), so each machine immediately recognizes the new drive, with all titles, user settings and timer rec programs intact on each machine! There's no reqmt to be mated (and limited) to a specific machine SN, as some HDTV DVRs are reqd to do. Also, unlike HDTV DVRs, external drives can be disconnected w/o losing everything (e.g., Tivo). All this makes the HDDs portable between PhilMag DVDRs that have at least the external SATA cable (move the dock between machines) or that have another docking station (move just the HDDs).. Even tho SATA drives are hot-swappable in computers, our Pioneers say it's not possible since the machine has to \"recognize\" the drive on machine startup. In fact, for now, drive swaps should only be done AFTER you see the blue or grey screen on your TV, indicating the drive and all ops have fully stopped, which is 10-20 sec AFTER you power the DVDR off. For 3575/3576/2080/2160, which have a PATA drive, you'll have to ADD an IDE/SATA Adapter like this one to connect to the existing 40-pin IDE cabling and allow SATA/eSATA cabling to the exterior. You can also order a SATA Adapter from Funai (~$12) butthen you'll need a \"simple\" mod. to add the PATA power connector, as described and pictured here.\u00a0The recommended IDE/SATA Adapter has the proper connections without modification. If you have a SATA-based model (2160A/513/515/53x/557), you don't need the \"IDE/SATA adapter.\" You just need a longer SATA/eSATA cable to reach a docking station outside the case. In deciding on your approach to a HDD farm, you might read some descriptions that mention \"eSATA\" when they're using std internal SATA drives. Just be aware that there are SATA AND eSATA HDDs, but their cable interfaces are not compatible with each other, as described in this Wiki article. An eSATA interface is deeper and ruggedized for repetitive connection/disconnection... which is NOT needed when using a HDD docking station (cables stay connected at all times). You don't need to use eSATA HDDs, just normal SATA drives. Many people say \"eSATA\" when they mean they \"externalized\" their std SATA drives thru an eSATA drive enclosure. That's the simplest approach and least costly cuz SATA drives are widely available and reasonably priced, as are single and multiple eSATA drive enclosures. Go back to list....

Expected Component Life & Actual Usage Stats A Funai rep. has provided some stats on expected life of the DVD and HDD drives, as follows: \"We cannot guarantee but our design life is more than 1,000 hr. In our lab test, the unit usually works more than 2,000 hr. Maybe, motor life is a key point of DVD drive life. \"Regarding HDD, nobody knows the life as you know. I met HDD sudden death few times in my PC. But in my experience, my job PC worked (10 hrs per day) x (250 days per year) x (3 years no trouble) = 7,500 hr. I think we can expect more than 10,000 hrs.\" While those stats can be considered only \"educated guesses\" of life expectancy, a more important measure is actual usage by our Members. Computerman3 recently reported that he had 9,631 hours of DVD use on his 3576 using crappy TDK discs, prob. also 16X! The table below contains more, but older, data reported by our PhilMag machines as of the dates noted in the table. The data is only from people who've taken the tme to report their usage stats and includes only their highest-mileage \"Phil\" (3575/3576) or \"Mag\" (2080/2160) model. To check your mileage, use SKIP 321 for DVD-WR/-RD times (hrs:min) FIRST cuz that menu can be exited with Back/Return, then use SKIP 079 for HDD POWER ON time (hrs), which requires a machine power-off to exit. Please post the numbers so I can add them to these tables and link your name to your post.

DVD-WR time is at full laser power; it's the disc-record/erase time, which depend on disc speed (e.g., 16X takes more power than 8X, 8X more than 4X). DVD-RD time is Standby (just plugged-in) laser power, called \"bias\" power. It's the power the machine maintains on the laser while it's \"off \"so it's \"ready to read\" from the get-go, AND it's the disc reading/playback power level. \u00a0, 289083=DigaDo ordered a replacement DVD drive for his 2160 from Funai and has taken pics located here (2 posts). As shown in DigaDo's pics, the replacement drive comes with the small attached CBA/PCB boards underneath with the mini-ribbon cables attached and ready to install on the separate, adjacent PCB that comes with the replacement drive, identified in the right-hand sketch above as the \"DVD/HDD Main CBA Assembly.\" Here's a post by dfw515 and, 6 posts down, some further discussion of specific instructions on working with the ribbon cables, etc. CAUTION: DigaDo also took some pics of a critical white-plastic slider part you should not touch cuz it breaks easily. Below are pics I took to see how difficult it was to remove the DVD drive (but not the mated PCB) from a 3575... it was pretty easy. \u00a0, 226808=*For 250-500GB upgrades, there are better options than this 5-yr-old drive series. The higher-capacity drives use a significantly higher IdleW power draw (+94%) compared to the OEM 80/160GB drive for which the 2080/357x were designed... and 2080/357x are at Idle a LOT compared to a 2160/513/515/53x/557. See Table II for a lower-power PATA HDD for the 2080/357x as a direct replacement. Also see Tables III-V or Tables A-1-A-3 for better OEM or Alternate lower-power SATA HDDs you can use in a 2080/357x by adding an IDE/SATA Adapter like this. Do not cover the small breather hole in HDDs, and don't put your finger on it (or it'll ingest your greasy boogers on next startup). Hitachi's breather hole is in back-top area. Go back to list....

OEM HDD for 2160 (OK for 357x/2080, But NOT 2160A/513/515/53x/557) Hitachi 7K500 Series \"GLAT\" PATA, One Confirmed OEM HDD in 2160 Special Note on Hitachi Deskstar HDDs, 163664=Go back to list.... Go to main list of help files. Special Note on Hitachi/Western Digital Deskstar HDDs Info on all Hitachi/WD Internal HDDs. Some boo-birds might deride Deskstars by mentioning they used to be called \"Deathstars\" but that was in the days that IBM made them (1994-2003). Hitachi bought IBM's HDD division in 2003, and Western Digital (WD) bought Hitachi's HGST (HDD) division in Mar 2012, so IBM \"Deathstars\" might have been sold for a time after 2003 as sellers cleaned out existing stock. If you get a Deskstar with mfg date between 1994 and 2003, you prob. have one of the IBM \"Deathstars\" and should return it? An interesting section of a Wiki article on HDD \"Disk Failures and their metrics\" caught my attention as it relates to the OEM Hitachi/WD HDDs used in many of these DVDRs: \"A 2007 study published by Google suggested very little correlation between failure rates and either high temperature or activity level; however, the correlation between manufacturer/model and failure rate was relatively strong. Statistics in this matter is (sic) kept highly secret by most entities. Google did not publish the manufacturer's names along with their respective failure rates, though they have since revealed that they use Hitachi Deskstar drives in some of their servers.\" Google has mfgr-related statistics they won't reveal on HDD failure rates, but they DID choose to reveal that they use Hitachi Deskstars in their servers... hmmmmm!? Backblaze, a company that mfgrs storage pods, also favors Hitachi drives. As they say here: \"We are constantly looking at new hard drives, evaluating them for reliability and power consumption. The Hitachi 3TB drive (Hitachi Deskstar 5K3000 HDS5C3030ALA630) is our current favorite for both its low power demand and astounding reliability. The Western Digital and Seagate equivalents we tested saw much higher rates of popping out of RAID arrays and drive failure. Even the Western Digital Enterprise Hard Drives had the same high failure rates. The Hitachi drives, on the other hand, perform wonderfully.\" Go back to list.... Go to main list of help files. Low-Power WD SATA HDDs See this post for info on some Western Digital (WD) drives that are low-power alternatives to the original OEM drives or Alternates listed in the tables below. Please note that, in your analysis of HDD power reqmts, IdleW (power used during idle) is essentially irrelevant to the 2160/2160A/513/515/53x/557 since they are seldom in an idle state... they're almost always auto-recording in the background. Thus, OpW or read/writeW (power during typical user ops) is the only power stat of real interest or consequence for them. However, IdleW is very important for the 3575/3576 since they're idling a lot. Go back to list.... Go to main list of help files. Internal HDD Upgrades}",

    "textBeforeTable": "\u00a0 Operational symptoms of an HDD that might benefit from the SKIP/V.SKIP 013 procedure include skipping/freezing on HDD playback, inability to initialize the HDD with SKIP/V.SKIP 079, inability to Pause manual recording and change channels while paused, etc. This is really just a check to verify whether or not you have a bad HDD and might need a replacement or upgrade. It can be useful, for example, after you've had a lightning strike nearby or power-loss while recording that you suspect may have damaged the HDD. To troubleshoot suspected HDD problems, use the SKIP/V.SKIP 079 Self-Check first to make sure there aren't any loose or disconnected cables or the HDD isn't stone-dead. Then, for a more in-depth HDD check, use SKIP/V.SKIP 013, which checks the HDD's internal components that we can't fix, like disc media, system and heads. The items it checks will show either OK or NG (No Good). If anything checks NG, then the RESULT will be NG and you may need a HDD replacement. Things can still work with a NG result... my 3575 refurb does... but the HDD might freeze during playback at certain spots on the HDD (like mine) or exhibit other \"odd\" bahavior (like twice as long to spin up and show opening menu). Items checked are the following: \u00a0 Read the description below first and make sure you want/need to do this procedure. Allow at least 1-hour w/no timer",
    "textAfterTable": "PATA/SATA and \"Jumpers\": The 3575/3576/2080/2160 are PATA-based units and came with IDE/PATA HDDs (Parallel ATA, or Advanced Technology Attachment). IDE and ATA are technically the same, just tradenames of diff. mfgrs. These DVDRs are plug-and-play if installing another PATA HDD. They can also use the newer Serial ATA (SATA) HDDs by adding an IDE/SATA Adapter to connect the smaller SATA drive connector to the 40-pin PATA PCB connector in those DVDR's. Formal nomenclature for SATA versions are I, II, III etc. but often referred to by common versions 1, 2, 3, etc. The Adapter used by many 3575/6 users is here. The 2160A/513/515/53x/557 are SATA-based, a newer Serial ATA standard. They already have a SATA HDD and SATA Adapter, so it's just plug-and-play if using another SATA drive... no other adapter needed. One user confirms (this post and 2nd one down) that his old 3576 takes both SATA 3 and SATA 6 drives without jumpers. He advises removing the jumper of a SATA/IDE adapter if used. 2160A and newer units are already SATA-based. Ask for help on jumpers since it IS an \"exotic\" subject. If you get an HDD made specifically for DVRs and other video applications, it should need no jumpers. \"Enterprise\" or server/computer use jumpers that are typically set for those apps... which happen to be not right for our app. If you install and format an HDD and it appears not to work, only then should you",
