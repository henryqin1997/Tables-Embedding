To the above reaction mixture was added 52 mg of m-SPA-2000 (mPEG-succinimidyl propionate, Shearwater Corporation, MW \u02dc2000 Da, 0.02605 mmol, 1.5 fold molar excess). The mixture was stirred for about 17 hours at room temperature under nitrogen. The reaction mixture was then dissolved in 0.1% TFA to a total volume of 5.5 mL and purified by reverse phase HPLC using a C-18 column, and acetonitrile/0.1% TFA as eluent). Reverse phase HPLC revealed a mixture of both mono (one PEG attached) and di-pegylated (two PEGs attached) product; the composition is referred to herein as \u201c2K PEG insulin\u201d., 39812=In an alternative embodiment, a PEG covalently coupled to insulin will possess a nominal average molecular weight of from about 200 to about 10,000 daltons. In a preferred embodiment, the PEG will possess a nominal average molecular weight from about 200 to about 5000 daltons. In yet a more preferred embodiment, the PEG will possess a nominal average molecular weight from about 200 to about 2000 daltons or from about 200 to about 1000 daltons., 33391=Long-acting insulin formulations are ideally characterized as having a very slow onset and a prolonged, relatively flat peak of action. Current long acting injectable insulin formulations, e.g., ultralente (extended insulin zinc suspension) and protamine zinc insulin suspension, are very unsatisfactory. These formulations tend to peak rather than provide a low basal concentration of insulin, are unpredictable, and typically exhibit a duration of action of no longer than about a day. The long half-life of ultralente insulin makes it difficult to determine the optimal dosage range, and protamine zinc insulin is rarely used because of its unpredictable and prolonged course of action (Goodman & Gilman, \u201cThe Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Ninth Ed., Hardman and Limbird, eds, 1996, p. 1500). Other long-acting injectable formulations which have been explored unsuccessfully include albumin-bound insulin and cobalt-insulin hexamer formulations (Hoffman, A., Ziv E., Clin. Pharmacokinet, 33(4):285-301 (1997))., 88719=More particularly, as described generally above, PEG-insulin conjugates having biodegradable linkages and useful in the present invention are represented by the following structures: PEG1-W-PEG2-insulin (where PEG1 and PEG2 can be the same or different) or PEG-W-insulin wherein W represents a weak, biodegradable linkage. These conjugates contain PEG arms or portions of PEG arms that are removable (i.e., cleavable) in-vivo. These particular modified insulins are typically substantially biologically inactive when intact, either due to the size of the intact PEG-portion of the molecule or due to steric blockage of the active sites on the insulin molecule by the PEG chain. However, such conjugates are cleaved under physiological conditions to thereby release insulin or a biologically active PEG-insulin capable of absorption into the systemic circulation, e.g., from the lung. In a first exemplary structure, the PEG1 portion may possess any of a number of different architectures discussed herein, and will typically possess a molecular weight of at least about 10,000, such that the conjugate is not rapidly absorbed upon administration. The PEG2 portion of the molecule preferably possesses a molecular weight of less than about 5000 daltons, more preferably less than 2000 daltons, and even more preferably less than 1000 daltons. Referring now to the secondary exemplary structure, PEG-W-insulin, the PEG portion will generally possess a molecular weight of at least about 10,000 Daltons or more., 173563=Fourteen (N=7/Group) fasted male rats (Hilltop Lab Animals, Scottsdale, Pa. (300-350 g)) with indwelling jugular vein catheters (JVC) were used for this study. Non-pegylated human insulin was administered to Group 1 as a 40 \u25adg/300 \u25adL i.t. dose. The PEGylated human insulin formulation was administered to Group 2 as a 150 \u25adg/300 \u25adL i.t. dose. Blood samples (\u02dc500 \u25adL) were collected at predose (2 to 0.25 hours prior to dosing), 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 360, 480, and 720 minutes postdose. A small amount of blood was placed on a glucose test strip for determination of blood glucose in the Glucometer Elite glucose monitor (Bayer Corp., Elkart, Ind.). The remainder of the sample was placed into serum separator tubes and analyzed by radioimmunoassay. Means and standard deviations (SD) were calculated using Microsoft\u25ad Excel 2000. Animal 2-3 was dropped from the study due to a clogged catheter., 126899=An inhaleable PEG-insulin composition may also be delivered using a pressurized, metered dose inhaler (MDI), e.g., the Ventolin\ufffd metered dose inhaler, containing a solution or suspension of drug in a pharmaceutically inert liquid propellant, e.g., a chlorofluorocarbon or fluorocarbon, as described in Laube, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,320,094, Jun. 14, 1994, and in Rubsamen, R. M., et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,672,581 (1994), both incorporated herein by reference., 81134=Branched PEGs for use in the conjugates of the invention include those described in International Patent Publication WO 96/21469, the contents of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Generally, branched PEGs can be represented by the formula R(PEG\u2014OH)n, where R represents the central \u201ccore\u201d molecule and n represents the number of arms. Branched PEGs have a central core from which extend 2 or more \u201cPEG\u201d arms. In a branched configuration, the branched polymer core possesses a single reactive site for attachment to insulin. Branched PEGs for use in the present invention will typically comprise fewer than 4 PEG arms, and more preferably, will comprise fewer than 3 PEG arms. Branched PEGs offer the advantage of having a single reactive site, coupled with a larger, more dense polymer cloud than their linear PEG counterparts. One particular type of branched PEG can be represented as (MeO-PEG-)pR\u2014X, where p equals 2 or 3, R is a central core structure such as lysine or glycerol having 2 or 3 PEG arms attached thereto, and X represents any suitable functional group that is or that can be activated for coupling to insulin. One particularly preferred branched PEG is mPEG2-NHS (Shearwater Corporation, Alabama) having the structure mPEG2-lysine-succinimide., 67783=A PEG-insulin conjugate of the invention will typically comprise one or more PEG chains each having a molecular weight ranging from about 200 to about 40,000 daltons, and preferably ranging from about 200 to about 10,000 daltons. Preferably, a PEG for use in the invention will possess an average molecular weight falling within one of the following ranges: from about 200 to 10,000 daltons, from about 200 to about 7500 daltons, from about 200 to about 6,000 daltons, from about 200 to about 5,000 daltons, from about 200 to about 3000 daltons, from about 200 to about 2000 daltons, and from about 200 to about 1000 daltons. Exemplary conjugates prepared with PEGs having molecular weights of 5,000 daltons, 2000 daltons and 750 daltons are provided in Examples 1-4., 124288=PEG-insulin formulations as described herein may be delivered using any suitable dry powder inhaler (DPI), i.e., an inhaler device that utilizes the patient's inhaled breath as a vehicle to transport the dry powder drug to the lungs. Preferred are Inhale Therapeutic Systems' dry powder inhalation devices as described in Patton, J. S., et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,458,135, Oct. 17, 1995; Smith, A. E., et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,740,794, Apr. 21, 1998; and in Smith, A. E., et. al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,785,049, Jul. 28, 1998, herein incorporated by reference. When administered using a device of this type, the powdered medicament is contained in a receptacle having a puncturable lid or other access surface, preferably a blister package or cartridge, where the receptacle may contain a single dosage unit or multiple dosage units. Convenient methods for filling large numbers of cavities (i.e., unit dose packages) with metered doses of dry powder medicament are described, e.g., in Parks, D. J., et al., International Patent Publication WO 97/41031, Nov. 6, 1997, incorporated herein by reference., 121138=The powders of the invention are further characterized by an aerosol particle size distribution less than about 10 \u03bcm mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD), preferably having MMADs less than about 5 \u03bcm, more preferably less than 4.0 \u03bcm, even more preferably less than 3.5 \u03bcm, and most preferably less than 3 \u03bcm. The mass median aerodynamic diameters of the powders will characteristically range from about 0.1-10 \u03bcm, preferably from about 0.2-5.0 \u03bcm MMAD, more preferably from about 1.0-4.0 \u03bcm MMAD, and even more preferably from about 1.5 to 3.0 \u03bcm. Small aerodynamic diameters can generally be achieved by a combination of optimized spray drying conditions and choice and concentration of excipients., 141686=Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was carried out on the 750-1, 750-2 and 2K PEG-insulin compositions described above employing two Shodex SEC columns (part number KW-802.5) assembled in series on a Waters 2690 HPLC system. The mobile phase consisted of 22% glacial acetic acid and 33% acetonitrile (V/V) in water. The chromatography data was used as an alternative approach for determining the relative amounts of mono, di, and tri-conjugated insulin in each of these compositions. The results are presented in Table 2 below. As can be seen by a comparison of the data in Tables 1 and 2, the two different methods provide results that are in close agreement with respect to the relative amounts of each type of conjugate present in the compositions., 48084=FIG. 12. is a plot of mean blood glucose concentrations following intratracheal instillation of pegylated (2K PEG Insulin, 300 \u03bcg/animal, 600 \u03bcg/animal, 900 \u03bcg/animal, and 1200 \u03bcg/animal) versus non-pegylated human insulin (80 \u03bcg/animal) in male rats (Example 12);, 110498=Additional excipients and additives useful in the present compositions and methods include but are not limited to proteins, non-biological polymers, and biological polymers, which may be present singly or in combination. Suitable excipients are those provided in Inhale Therapeutic Systems' International Publication Nos. WO 96/32096 and 98/16205. Preferred are excipients having glass transition temperatures (Tg), above about 35\ufffd C., preferably above about 40\ufffd C., more preferably above 45\ufffd C., most preferably above about 55\ufffd C., 84061=In one particular embodiment of the invention, the linkage of the forked PEG to the insulin molecule, (Y), is hydrolytically stable. In a preferred embodiment, n is 2. Suitable Y moieties, prior to conjugation with a reactive site on insulin, include but are not limited to active esters, active carbonates, aldehydes, isocyanates, isothiocyanates, epoxides, alcohols, maleimides, vinylsulfones, hydrazides, dithiopyridines, and iodacetamides. Selection of a suitable activating group will depend upon the intended site of attachment on the insulin molecule and can be readily determined by one of skill in the art. The corresponding Y group in the resulting PEG-insulin conjugate is that which results from reaction of the activated forked polymer with a suitable reactive site on insulin. The specific identity of such the final linkage will be apparent to one skilled in the art. For example, if the reactive forked PEG contains an activated ester, such as a succinimide or maleimide ester, conjugation via an amine site on insulin will result in formation of the corresponding amide linkage. These particular forked polymers are particularly attractive since they provide conjugates having a molar ratio of insulin to PEG of 2:1 or greater. Such conjugates may be less likely to block the insulin receptor site, while still providing the flexibility in design to protect the insulin against enzymatic degradation, e.g., by insulin degrading enzyme., 68583=Preferred PEG-insulins for administration to the lung will possess a PEG moiety having a molecular weight less than about 5000 daltons, preferably less than about 2000 daltons, and even less than about 1000 daltons. In one particular embodiment of the invention, the PEG-insulin conjugate possesses a PEG moiety having one of the following average molecular weights: 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500, 4000 or 5000. Higher molecular weight PEGs may, in certain instances, be less preferred due to a potential for loss of activity of the insulin molecule or, for pulmonary applications, reduced efficiency in crossing the lung (Example 8)., 237939=Another exemplary pegylated insulin composition, 2K PEG insulin, was administered to rats by intratracheal administration. The 2K PEG insulin used for this study was prepared as described in Example 3. Animals were dosed at 80 \u03bcg insulin per animal for non-pegylated insulin. Animals were dosed at 300 \u03bcg insulin per animal, 600 \u03bcg insulin per animal, 900 \u03bcg insulin per animal, and 1200 \u03bcg insulin per animal for 2K PEG insulin. The in-vivo rat study was conducted essentially as described in Example 8 above. The precise dosing regimen followed and doses administered are summarized in the tables below., 115288=Dry powder formulations of the invention comprising a PEG-insulin conjugate may be prepared by any of a number of drying techniques, and preferably by spray drying. Spray drying of the formulations is carried out, for example, as described generally in the \u201cSpray Drying Handbook\u201d, 5th ed., K. Masters, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, N.Y. (1991), and in Platz, R., et al., International Patent Publication Nos. WO 97/41833 (1997) and WO 96/32149 (1996), the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference., 91023=Additional representative mono-and di-functional PEGs having either linear or branched structures for use in preparing the conjugates of the invention may be purchased from Shearwater Corporation (Alabama). Illustrative structures are described in Shearwater's 2001 catalogue entitled \u201cPolyethylene Glycol and Derivatives for Biomedical Applications\u201d, the contents of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference., 164248=The animals were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane. The i.v. doses (300 \u03bcL/animal) were given through the FVC and then the catheter was tied off to eliminate cross contamination with the blood draws. All blood samples were drawn through the JVC. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was administered to Group 1 as a 300 \u03bcL i.v. dose. Non-pegylated human insulin was administered to Group 2 as a 20 \u03bcg/animal i.v. dose. The PEGylated human insulin formulation was administered to Group 3 as a 20 \u03bcg/animal i.v. dose, Group 4 as a 40 \u03bcg/animal i.v. dose, and Group 5 as a 30 \u03bcg/animal i.v. dose. Blood samples (\u02dc500 \u03bcL) were collected from the JVC at predose (2 to 0.25 hours prior to dosing), 10, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes postdose. A small amount of blood was placed on a glucose test strip for determination of blood glucose by the Glucometer Elite glucose monitor (Bayer Corp., Elkart, Ind.). The remainder of the sample was placed into serum separator tubes and placed into the centrifuge to separate the blood. The serum was then decanted into a separate tube and analyzed by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Means and standard deviations (SD) were calculated using Microsoft\ufffd Excel 2000., 252621=A plot of mean blood glucose concentrations following intratracheal administration is shown in FIG. 12. Good dose response was observed for the pegylated insulin compositions when administered to the lung (i.e., higher doses of 2K PEG insulin resulted in a greater decrease in blood glucose concentration). Although the time point in the curve at which maximum glucose suppression was achieved appears to be about 3 hours for both the pegylated and non-pegylated compositions, the profiles for the pegylated versus non-pegylated insulin differ significantly with respect to duration of glucose suppression. In particular, for time points past about 6 hours, at the three higher 2K pegylated insulin doses (600 \u03bcg, 900 \u03bcg, and 1200 \u03bcg per animal), glucose levels were suppressed significantly below those of non-pegylated insulin. These results further demonstrate that a prolonged systemic effect can be achieved by administration of pegylated insulin to the lung., 75663=In addition to native insulin, non-native insulins having one or more amino acid substitutions, insertions, or deletions may be utilized such that additional sites become available for chemical modification by attachment of one or more PEG moieties. This embodiment of the invention is particularly useful for introducing additional, customized pegylation-sites within the insulin molecule, for example, for forming a PEG-insulin having improved resistance to enzymatic degradation. Such an approach provides greater flexibility in the design of an optimized insulin conjugate having the desired balance of activity, stability, solubility, and pharmacological properties. Although mutations can be carried out, i.e., by site specific mutagenesis, at any number of positions within the insulin molecule, preferred is an insulin variant in which any one of the first four amino acids in the B-chain is replaced with a cysteine residue. Such cysteine residues can then be reacted with an activated PEG that is specific for reaction with thiol groups, e.g., an N-maleimidyl polymer or other derivative, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,208 and in International Patent Publication No. WO 01/62827. Exemplary sulfhydryl-selective PEGs for use in this particular embodiment of the invention include mPEG-forked maleimide (mPEG(MAL)2), mPEG2-forked maleimide (mPEG2(MAL)2), mPEG-maleimide (mPEG-MAL), and mPEG2-maleimide (mPEG2-MAL) (Shearwater Corporation). The structures of these activated PEGS are as follows: mPEG-CONHCH[CH2CONH(CH2CH2O)2CH2CH2-MAL, mPEG2-lysine-NH\u2014CH[CH2CONH (CH2CH2O)2CH2CH2-MAL]2, mPEG-MAL, and mPEG2-lysine-NH\u2014CH2CH2NHC(O)CH2CH2MAL, respectively., 136562=Two different syntheses were carried out on this material both utilizing the above synthetic methodology with one exception: one synthesis was carried out at a molar ratio of mPEG-SPA-750 to insulin of 7:1 while the other synthesis was conducted at a molar ratio of mPEG-SPA-750 to insulin of 3:1. The product compositions resulting from these two preparations are referred to herein as \u201c750-1 PEG insulin\u201d (molar ratio of PEG reagent to insulin was 7:1) and \u201c750-2 PEG insulin\u201d (molar ratio of PEG reagent to insulin was 3:1)., 26325=This application is a continuation of U.S. Application Ser. No. 10/154,057 filed May 21, 2002, which claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/292,423, filed on May 21, 2001 the content of which is incorporated therein by reference in its entirety., 125412=Other dry powder dispersion devices for pulmonary administration of dry powders include those described, for example, in Newell, R. E., et al, European Patent No. EP 129985, Sep. 7, 1988; in Hodson, P. D., et al., European Patent No. EP472598, Jul. 3, 1996; in Cocozza, S., et al., European Patent No. EP 467172, Apr. 6, 1994, and in Lloyd, L. J. et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,522,385, Jun. 4, 1996, incorporated herein by reference. Also suitable for delivering PEG-insulin dry powders are inhalation devices such as the Astra-Draco \u201cTURBUHALER\u201d. This type of device is described in detail in Virtanen, R., U.S. Pat. No. 4,668,218, May 26, 1987; in Wetterlin, K., et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,667,668, May 26, 1987; and in Wetterlin, K., et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,805,811, Feb. 21, 1989, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Other suitable devices include dry powder inhalers such as Rotahaler\ufffd (Glaxo), Discus\ufffd (Glaxo), Spiros\u2122 inhaler (Dura Pharmaceuticals), and the Spinhaler\ufffd (Fisons). Also suitable are devices which employ the use of a piston to provide air for either entraining powdered medicament, lifting medicament from a carrier screen by passing air through the screen, or mixing air with powder medicament in a mixing chamber with subsequent introduction of the powder to the patient through the mouthpiece of the device, such as described in Mulhauser, P., et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,388,572, Sep. 30, 1997, incorporated herein by reference., 118605=In yet another approach, dry powders may be prepared by agglomerating the powder components, sieving the materials to obtain agglomerates, spheronizing to provide a more spherical agglomerate, and sizing to obtain a uniformly-sized product, as described, e.g., and in Ahlneck, C., et al., International PCT Publication No. WO 95/09616, 1995, incorporated herein by reference., 131461=150 mg (\u02dc0.025 mmol) of newly purified di-N\u03b1A1,N\u03b5B29-t-boc-Insulin from Example 1 was dissolved in 4 mL of DMSO containing 95 \u03bcL of triethylamine. 169 mg (0.032 mmol) of mPEG-SPA-5000 (mPEG-succinimidyl propionate, mPEG-O\u2014CH2CH2C(O)O-succinimide, MW 5,000) was added to the insulin solution. After incubation overnight (29 hours) at room temperature, the resulting mPEG-insulin derivative was diluted to 100 mL with D.I. water, dialyzed against D.I. water for 4 hours and then lyophilized. The lyophilized product was re-dissolved in 4 mL of anhydrous TFA and maintained under N2 at 0\ufffd C. for 1.5 hours to remove the Boc protecting groups. The deprotected mPEG-insulin was diluted to 50 mL with D.I. water and dialyzed against 0.1% NH4HCO3 and D.I. water overnight. Lyophilization of the product yielded a white powder. Yield was 117.6 mg (41.6%, MW \u02dc11311.6 by MALDI)., 34450=A number of long-acting pulmonary insulin formulations have also been explored. These include liposomes containing a large excess of lipid relative to insulin (Liu. F-Y, et al., Pharm. Res. 10, 228-232, (1993)), porous poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) insulin particles (Edwards, D. A., et al., Science 276(5320), 1868-1871 (1997)), nebulized PLGA nanospheres (Kawashima, Y., et al., J. Controlled Release, 62(1-2): 279-287 (1999)) and phospholipid/protamine insulin formulations (Vanbever, R., et al., Proc. Control Rel. Bioact. Mater. 25, 261-262 (1998)). Unfortunately, all of these formulations have proven unsatisfactory, due to either low bioavailabilities when administered in rats, or due to formulation insufficiencies. Thus, a long-felt need exists for optimized long-acting insulin formulations that are bioactive, physically and chemically stable, water-soluble, and preferably monomeric. Ideally, such formulations will preferably be suited for pulmonary administration., 135772=63.4 mg (\u02dc0.01056 mmol) of newly purified di-NA1,NB29-t-boc-Insulin from Example 4A was dissolved in 0.5 mL of DMSO containing 200 uL of triethylamine. 33 mg (0.03173 mmol, MW of mSPA750 is about 1040Da) of mPEG-SPA-750 (mPEG-succinimidyl propionate, mPEG-O\u2014CH2CH2C(O)O-succinimide, PEG MW 750) was added to the insulin solution. After incubation overnight (29 hours) at room temperature, 300 uL of TFA was added to the reaction mixture and the resulting mPEG-insulin derivative was precipitated in 100 mL ethyl ether and dried under vacuum. Yield was about 28.5 mg with 21.3 mg of insulin content measured by reverse phase HPLC (33.6%, MW \u02dc6639.3Da by MALDI. For simplicity, the composition is referred to herein as \u201c750 PEG Insulin\u201d.}",
