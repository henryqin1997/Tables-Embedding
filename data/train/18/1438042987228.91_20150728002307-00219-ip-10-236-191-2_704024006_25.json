Two benchmark programs have been used: bench_001 and bench_002 which use Btree and Queue as access methods. They are based on examples_c/bench_001.c that comes with Berkeley DB. Notice: the access method Queue requires fixed size records and the access methods is record numbers (simply increasing). This method may be used for the backup of the incoming EDB. Notice: the tests have not (yet) been run multiple times, at least not systematically. Testing showed that the runtimes may vary noticable.
