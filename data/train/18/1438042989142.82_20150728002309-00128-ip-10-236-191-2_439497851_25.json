            "Overcurrent detecting circuit and semiconductor device - A highly precise temperature compensation is applied in the detection of overcurrent. A control circuit detects a potential difference produced across a wire owing to the resistance of the wire and a load current that flows into the wire, which connects an NMOS transistor and an output terminal, and controls the NMOS transistor so as to limit the load current if the potential difference exceeds a prescribed value. The control circuit",
            "Overcurrent detection circuit - An overcurrent detection circuit in accordance with an exemplary aspect of the present invention includes a detection transistor, a potential difference setting unit, and a first transistor whose current value is controlled by the potential difference setting unit. Further, the potential difference setting unit includes a first depletion type transistor, a power-supply voltage being supplied to the drain of the first depletion type transistor, and the gate and source of the first depletion type transistor being connected to the gate of the first transistor, a second transistor, the drain and gate of the second transistor being connected to the gate of the first transistor, and a second depletion type transistor provided on the current path between the sources of the first transistor and the second transistor, the gate and drain of the second depletion type transistor being connected to the source of the detection transistor.",
            "Power semiconductor device and operation method thereof - A power semiconductor device has: an output transistor connected between a power-supply terminal and an output terminal; a gate charge-discharge circuit configured to charge/discharge a first node connected to a gate of the output transistor to ON/OFF control the output transistor; a short switch circuit connected between the first node and the output terminal; and a short control circuit configured to control the short switch circuit. In the turn-ON period, the ON period and the turn-OFF period, the short control circuit cuts off electrical connection between the first node and the output terminal through the short switch circuit. In the OFF period, the short control circuit electrically connects the first node and the output terminal through the short switch circuit.",
            "POWER SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE - A power semiconductor device includes an output transistor, a control circuit connected with a gate of the output transistor, a first discharge route from a first node to a ground terminal, and a second discharge route from the first node to the ground terminal. In a usual turn-off, only the first discharge route is used. When a load abnormality occurs, both of the first and second discharge routes are used. The second discharge route contains a discharge transistor and a countercurrent prevention device. The discharge transistor is connected between the first node and the second node. The countercurrent prevention device prevents a flow of current from the third node to the second node. At least, in an OFF period, the control circuit sets the gate voltage of the discharge transistor to a high level.",
