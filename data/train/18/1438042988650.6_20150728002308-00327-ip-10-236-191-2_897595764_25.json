Despite the weather, Weinke and his teammates had no problem, as he hit nine-of-14 passes for 155 yards and a touchdown while also rushing for 50 yards in not quite a half of action in an easy 46-0 win. Next week: at Desert Edge (8/31) SEAN RENFREE / SCOTTSDALE NOTRE DAME PREP COLLEGE: GEORGIA TECH Renfree threw for 2,400 yards and 24 TDs last year, but one of his toughest games came against Desert Edge, the school Notre Dame Prep opens with this Friday. Last year Renfree hit just 4-of-9 pases for 35 yards against Desert Edge, but the Saints did manage to escape with a 3-0 win. This week: vs. Palatka (8/31) KYLE PARKER / BARTRAM TRAIL COLLEGE: CLEMSON Bartram Trail should be pretty solid in '07",
