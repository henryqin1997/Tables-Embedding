My freshman year was amazing. I learned many things in class that I used outside of class. Professors take the time to answer questions students may have, and make convenient office hours for us. I know this school has a lot to offer to present and future students., 352783=California State University San Bernardino has great teaching staff, and very diverse student attendance. The ratio from boys to girls are 4:1. It's one of the safest campuses in the state of California., 267207=On a scale from 1-10 I would rate Cal State San Bernardino an 8 based off my recent experience of SOAR. At SOAR, which is an orientation for incoming freshman, the staff, students, and faculty made me feel welcome to their college and were filled with joy and enthusiasm to see the class of 2016. The students made sure we felt comfortable and had the best time at Cal State San Bernardino. Also this college is very diverse and mixed with all kinds of nationalities which makes meeting people even better., 576271=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 178411=Every year they have a walk against domestic violence in the month of May. It's not on campus but is near and is for a great cause!!}",
