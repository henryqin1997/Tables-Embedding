    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{319768=HRMS: theoretical, 429.2285; measured, 429.2283., 345779=The plasmid pDSE101 was constructed as follows: A restriction fragment containing part of the SEAP gene coding sequence was cut out of the plasmid pGEM7zf(\u2212)/SEAP using the restriction enzymes Apa I and KpnI. The ends of the linear DNA fragments were chewed back with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA Polymerase I. The \u201cblunt ended\u201d DNA containing the truncated SEAP gene was isolated by electrophoresing the digest in an agarose gel and cutting out the 1910 base pair fragment. This 1910 base pair fragment was ligated into the plasmid pCMV-RE-AKI which had been cut with Bgl-II and filled in with E. coli Klenow fragment DNA polymerase. Recombinant plasmids were screened for insert orientation and sequenced through the ligated junctions. The plasmid pCMV-RE-AKI is derived from plasmid pCMVIE-AKI-DHFR (Whang, Y., Silberklang, M., Morgan, A., Munshi, S., Lenny, A. B., Ellis, R. W., and Kieff, E. (1987) J. Virol., 61, 1796-1807) by removing an EcoRI fragment containing the DHFR and Neomycin markers. Five copies of the fos promoter serum response element were inserted as described previously (Jones, R. E., Defeo-Jones, D., McAvoy, E. M., Vuocolo, G. A., Wegrzyn, R. J., Haskell, K. M. and Oliff, A. (1991) Oncogene, 6, 745-751) to create plasmid pCMV-RE-AKI., 328970=Step F: Preparation of 14-Amino-14-(3-methyl-3H-imidazol-4-yl)-2,9-dioxa-tricyclo[13.3.1.13,7]eicosa-1(18),3,5,7(20),15(19),16-hexaene-18-carbonitrile, 354445=The DNA sequence encoding the truncated SEAP gene is inserted into the pCMV-AKI-InA plasmid at the Bgl-II site of the vector. The SEAP gene is cut out of plasmid pGEM7zf(\u2212)/SEAP (described above) using EcoRI and HindIII. The fragment is filled in with Klenow DNA polymerase and the 1970 base pair fragment isolated from the vector fragment by agarose gel electrophoresis. The pCMV-AKI-InA vector is prepared by digesting with Bgl-II and filling in the ends with Klenow DNA polymerase. The final construct is generated by blunt end ligating the SEAP fragment into the pCMV-AKI-InA vector. Transformants were screened for the proper insert and then mapped for restriction fragment orientation. Properly oriented recombinant constructs were sequenced across the cloning junctions to verify the correct sequence. The resulting plasmid, named pCMV-SEAP-A (deposited in the ATCC under Budapest Treaty on Aug. 27, 1998, and designated ATCC), contains a modified SEAP sequence downstream of the cytomegalovirus immediately early promoter IE-1 and intron A sequence and upstream of the bovine growth hormone poly-A sequence. The plasmid expresses SEAP in a constitutive manner when transfected into mammalian cells., 293163=The instant compounds may also be useful in combination with an integrin antagonist for the treatment of cancer, as described in U.S. Ser. No. 09/055,487, filed Apr. 6, 1998, and WO 98/44797, published on Oct. 15, 1998, which are incorporated herein by reference., 342929=Rat 1 cells transformed with either v-ras, v-raf, or v-mos are seeded at a density of 1\ufffd104 cells per plate (35 mm in diameter) in a 0.3% top agarose layer in medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) over a bottom agarose layer (0.6%). Both layers contain 0.1% methanol or an appropriate concentration of the instant compound (dissolved in methanol at 1000 times the final concentration used in the assay). The cells are fed twice weekly with 0.5 ml of medium A containing 0.1% methanol or the concentration of the instant compound. Photomicrographs are taken 16 days after the cultures are seeded and comparisons are made., 261118=c) an IC50 (a measurement of in vitro inhibitory activity) against H-Ras dependent activation of MAP kinases in cells at least 1000 fold lower than the inhibitory activity (IC50) against H-ras-CVLL (SEQ.ID.NO.: 1) dependent activation of MAP kinases in cells., 132604=Indirect inhibition of farnesyl-protein transferase in vivo has been demonstrated with lovastatin (Merck & Co., Rahway, N.J.) and compactin (Hancock et al., ibid; Casey et al., ibid; Schafer et al., Science 245:379 (1989)). These drugs inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the rate limiting enzyme for the production of polyisoprenoids including farnesyl pyrophosphate. Farnesyl-protein transferase utilizes farnesyl pyrophosphate to covalently modify the Cys thiol group of the Ras CAAX box with a farnesyl group (Reiss et al., Cell, 62:81-88 (1990); Schaber et al., J. Biol Chem., 265:14701-14704 (1990); Schafer et al., Science, 249:1133-1139 (1990); Manne et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 87:7541-7545 (1990)). Inhibition of farnesyl pyrophosphate biosynthesis by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase blocks Ras membrane localization in cultured cells. However, direct inhibition of farnesyl-protein transferase would be more specific and attended by fewer side effects than would occur with the required dose of a general inhibitor of isoprene biosynthesis., 301892=WO 99/02175 (Jan. 21, 1999); U.S. Ser.

B., Ellis, R. W., and Kieff, E. (1987) J. Virol., 61:1796-1807) containing the CMV immediate early promoter was cut with EcoRI generating two fragments. The vector fragment was isolated by agarose electrophoresis and religated. The resulting plasmid is named pCMV-AKI. Next, the cytomegalovirus intron A nucleotide sequence was inserted downstream of the CMV IE1 promter in pCMV-AKI. The intron A sequence was isolated from a genomic clone bank and subcloned into pBR322 to generate plasmid p16T-286. The intron A sequence was mutated at nucleotide 1856 (nucleotide numbering as in Chapman, B. S., Thayer, R. M., Vincent, K. A. and Haigwood, N. L., Nuc. Acids Res. 19, 3979-3986) to remove a SacI restriction site using site directed mutagenesis. The mutated intron A sequence was PCRed from the plasmid p16T-287 using the following oligos., 267212=The instant compounds may also be useful in the treatment and prevention of polycystic kidney disease (D. L. Schaffner et al. American Journal of Pathology, 142:1051-1060 (1993) and B. Cowley, Jr. et al. FASEB Journal, 2:A3160 (1988))., 323446=HRMS: theoretical, 511.2704; measured, 511.2701., 215950=The compounds of the present invention may have asymmetric centers, chiral axes and chiral planes, and occur as racemates, racemic mixtures, and as individual diastereomers, with all possible isomers, including optical isomers, being included in the present invention. (See E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds (John Wiley and Sons, New York 1994), in particular pages 1119-1190) When any variable (e.g. aryl, heterocycle, R1a, R6 etc.) occurs more than one time in any constituent, its definition on each occurrence is independent at every other occurrence. Also, combinations of substituents/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds., 269746=Additionally, the compounds of the instant invention may be administered to a mammal in need thereof using a gel extrusion mechanism (GEM) device, such as that described in U.S. Ser.

These compounds may improve the treatment of corneal opacity which results from cauterization-induced corneal inflammation. The instant compounds may also be useful in reducing corneal edema and neovascularization. (K. Sonoda et al., Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci., 1998, vol. 39, p 2245-2251)., 301562=U.S. Ser. No. 08/468,161, filed on Jun. 6, 1995;, 340608=The cell line used in this assay is a v-ras line derived from either Rat1 or NIH3T3 cells, which expressed viral Ha-ras p21. The assay is performed essentially as described in DeClue, J. E. et al., Cancer Research 51:712-717, (1991). Cells in 10 cm dishes at 50-75% confluency are treated with the test compound (final concentration of solvent, methanol or dimethyl sulfoxide, is 0.1%). After 4 hours at 37\ufffd C., the cells are labeled in 3 ml methionine-free DMEM supplemented with 10% regular DMEM, 2% fetal bovine serum and 400 \u03bcCi[35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol). After an additional 20 hours, the cells are lysed in 1 ml lysis buffer (1% NP40/20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5/5 mM MgCl2/1 mM DTT/10 mg/ml aprotinen/2 mg/ml leupeptin/2 mg/ml antipain/0.5 mM PMSF) and the lysates cleared by centrifugation at 100,000\ufffdg for 45 min. Aliquots of lysates containing equal numbers of acid-precipitable counts are bought to 1 ml with IP buffer (lysis buffer lacking DTT) and immuno-precipitated with the ras-specific monoclonal antibody Y13-259 (Furth, M. E. et al., J. Virol. 43:294-304, (1982)). Following a 2 hour antibody incubation at 4\ufffd C., 200 \u03bcl of a 25% suspension of protein A-Sepharose coated with rabbit anti rat IgG is added for 45 min. The immuno-precipitates are washed four times with IP buffer (20 nM HEPES, pH 7.5/1 mM EDTA/1% Triton X-100.0.5% deoxycholate/0.1%/SDS/0.1M NaCl) boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and loaded on 13% acrylamide gels. When the dye front reached the bottom, the gel is fixed, soaked in Enlightening, dried and autoradiographed. The intensities of the bands corresponding to farnesylated and nonfarnesylated ras proteins are compared to determine the percent inhibition of farnesyl transfer to protein., 266724=The instant compounds may also be useful in the treatment of certain viral infections, in particular in the treatment of hepatitis delta and related viruses (J. S. Glenn et al. Science, 256:1331-1333 (1992)., 319164=HRMS: theoretical, 401.1972; measured, 401.1951., 318068=KOH (7.0 g, 0.105 mol) was added slowly to a hot solution of the diester from Step C (14 g, 0.046 mol) in ethylene glycol (50 mL) with stirring under Ar. The reaction mixture was heated at reflux for 3 hr, cooled, acidified to pH=2 with HCl, diluted with H2O (150 mL), and extracted with benzene (3\ufffd50 mL). The organic layers were combined, washed with dilute NaHCO3 solution (2\ufffd100 mL), H2O (2\ufffd50 mL), dried, filtered, and concentrated to dryness to give the title compound after chromatography on SiO2 eluting with CHCl3:MeOH, 40:1., 350012=The N-terminal oligos (SEQ.ID.NO.: 4 and SEQ.ID.NO.: 5) were used to generate a 1560 bp N-terminal PCR product that contained EcoRI and HpaI restriction sites at the ends. The Antisense N-terminal oligo (SEQ.ID.NO.: 5) introduces an internal translation STOP codon within the SEAP gene along with the HpaI site. The C-terminal oligos (SEQ.ID.NO.: 6 and SEQ.ID.NO.: 7) were used to amplify a 412 bp C-terminal PCR product containing HpaI and HindIII restriction sites. The sense strand C-terminal oligo (SEQ.ID.NO.: 6) introduces the internal STOP codon as well as the HpaI site. Next, the N-terminal amplicon was digested with EcoRI and HpaI while the C-terminal amplicon was digested with HpaI and HindIII. The two fragments comprising each end of the SEAP gene were isolated by electro-phoresing the digest in an agarose gel and isolating the 1560 and 412 base pair fragments. These two fragments were then co-ligated into the vector pGEM7zf(\u2212) (Promega) which had been restriction digested with EcoRI and HindIII and isolated on an agarose gel. The resulting clone, pGEM7zf(\u2212)/SEAP contains the coding sequence for the SEAP gene from amino acids., 301796=WO 98/18493 (May 7, 1998); U.S. Ser. No. 08/950,805, filed on Oct. 14, 1997;, 334992=2-Methyl-propane-2-sulfinic acid [1-(4-cyano-3-fluoro-phenyl)-4-[2-(3-methoxy-phenyl)-ethylamino]-1-(3-methyl-3-H-imidazol-4-yl)-butyl]-amide (0.075 g, 0.1427 mmol) was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (7 mL) with cooling in an ice-H2O bath, then treated with BBr3 (1 mL of a 1M solution in CH2Cl2, 1 mmol). After 15 min., H2O (3 mL) was added and the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in MeOH and stirred at ambient temperature for 15 min. Concentration to dryness gave the title compound which was used without further purification.

B., Ellis, R. W., and Kieff, E. (1987) J. Virol., 61:1796-1807) containing the CMV immediate early promoter and bovine growth hormone poly-A sequence can be cut with EcoRI generating two fragments. The vector fragment can be isolated by agarose electrophoresis and religated. The resulting plasmid is named pCMV-AKI. The DNA sequence encoding the truncated SEAP gene can be inserted into the pCMV-AKI plasmid at a unique Bgl-II in the vector. The SEAP gene is cut out of plasmid pGEMzf(\u2212)/SEAP (described above) using EcoRI and HindIII. The fragments are filled in with Klenow DNA polymerase and the 1970 base pair fragment is isolated from the vector fragment by agarose gel electrophoresis. The pCMV-AKI vector is prepared by digesting with Bgl-II and filling in the ends with Klenow DNA polymerase. The final construct is generated by blunt end ligating the SEAP fragment into the vector and transforming the ligation reaction into E. coli DH5\u03b1 cells. Transformants can then be screened for the proper insert and mapped for restriction fragment orientation. Properly oriented recombinant constructs would be sequenced across the cloning junctions to verify the correct sequence. The resulting plasmid, named pCMV-SEAP-B contains a modified SEAP sequence downstream of the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter, IE1, and upstream of a bovine growth hormone poly-A sequence. The plasmid would express SEAP in a constitutive nammer when transfected into mammalian cells., 213396=5-(4-Cyano-8-methyl-10-oxo-2-oxa-9-aza-tricyclo[11.3.1.13,7]octadeca-1(16),3(18),4,6,13(17),14-hexaen-8-yl)-1-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-ium 2,2,2-trifluoroacetate;, 301395=U.S. Pat.

The day before the assay is set up, 5\ufffd106 cells are plated on 15 cm plates to ensure the same stage of confluency in each assay. The media for these cells is RPM1 1640 (Gibco), with 15% fetal bovine serum and 1\ufffd Pen/Strep antibiotic mix. The day of the assay, cells are collected from the 15 cm plates by trypsinization and diluted to 400,000 cells/ml in media. 0.5 ml of these diluted cells are added to each well of 24-well plates, for a final cell number of 200,000 per well.

A compound is considered a selective inhibitor of farnesyl-protein transferase, for example, when its in vitro farnesyl-protein transferase inhibitory activity, as assessed by the assay described in Example 8, is at least 100 times greater than the in vitro activity of the same compound against geranylgeranyl-protein transferase-type I in the assay described in Example 9. Preferably, a selective compound exhibits at least 1000 times greater activity against one of the enzymatic activities when comparing geranylgeranyl-protein transferase-type I inhibition and farnesyl-protein transferase inhibition., 213960=5-(4-Cyano-8-methyl-10-oxo-2-oxa-9-aza-(16-spiro-(2-cyclohexanone) tricyclo[15.3.1.13,7]docosa-1(20),3(22),4,6,17(21),18-hexaen-8-yl)-1-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-ium 2,2,2-trifluoroacetate;, 382685=The heat treated media is assayed for alkaline phosphatase by a luminescence assay using the luminescence reagent CSPD\ufffd (Tropix, Bedford, Mass.). A volume of 50 \u03bcl media is combined with 200 \u03bcl of CSPD cocktail and incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature. Luminesence is monitored using an ML2200 microplate luminometer (Dynatech). Luminescence reflects the level of activation of the fos reporter construct stimulated by the transiently expressed protein., 344324=The plasmid, pDSE100 was constructed as follows. A restriction fragment encoding the SEAP coding sequence was cut out of the plasmid pSEAP2-Basic using the restriction enzymes EcoRl and HpaI. The ends of the linear DNA fragments were filled in with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA Polymerase I. The \u2018blunt ended\u2019 DNA containing the SEAP gene was isolated by electrophoresing the digest in an agarose gel and cutting out the 1694 base pair fragment. The vector plasmid pCMV-RE-AKI was linearized with the restriction enzyme Bgl-II and the ends filled in with Klenow DNA Polymerase I. The SEAP DNA fragment was blunt end ligated into the pCMV-RE-AKI vector and the ligation products were transformed into DH5-alpha E. coli cells (Gibco-BRL). Transformants were screened for the proper insert and then mapped for restriction fragment orientation. Properly oriented recombinant constructs were sequenced across the cloning junctions to verify the correct sequence. The resulting plasmid contains the SEAP coding sequence downstream of the DSE and CAT-TATA promoter elements and upstream of the BGH poly-A sequence., 213585=5-(4-Cyano-8-methyl-10-oxo-2-oxa-9-aza-tricyclo[13.3.1.13,7]eicosa-1(18),3(20),4,6,15(19),16-hexaen-8-yl)-1-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-ium 2,2,2-trifluoroacetate;, 131779=Inhibition of farnesyl-protein transferase has been shown to block the growth of Ras-transformed cells in soft agar and to modify other aspects of their transformed phenotype. It has also been demonstrated that certain inhibitors of farnesyl-protein transferase selectively block the processing of the Ras oncoprotein intracellularly (N. E. Kohl et al., Science, 260:1934-1937 (1993) and G. L. James et al., Science, 260:1937-1942 (1993). Recently, it has been shown that an inhibitor of farnesyl-protein transferase blocks the growth of ras-dependent tumors in nude mice (N. E. Kohl et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U.S.A., 91:9141-9145 (1994) and induces regression of mammary and salivary carcinomas in ras transgenic mice (N. E.

Such antisense oligonucleotides are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,576,208 and PCT Publ. No. WO 99/22772. The instant compounds are particularly useful when co-administered with the antisense oligonucleotide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ.ID.NO: 2 of U.S. Pat.

Thus, expression plasmids for H-ras, N-ras, K-ras, Myr-ras or H-ras-CVLL are co-precipitated with the DSE-SEAP reporter construct. (A ras expression plasmid is not included when the cell is transfected with the pCMV-SEAP plasmid.) For 10 cm plates 600 \u03bcl of CaCl2-DNA solution is added dropwise while vortexing to 600 \u03bcl of 2\ufffd HBS buffer to give 1.2 ml of precipitate solution (see recipes below). This is allowed to sit at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes. While the precipitate is forming, the media on the C33A cells is replaced with DMEM (minus phenol red; Gibco cat. No. 31053-028)+0.5% charcoal stripped calf serum+1\ufffd(Pen/Strep, Glutamine and nonessential aminoacids). The CaPO4-DNA precipitate is added dropwise to the cells and the plate rocked gently to distribute. DNA uptake is allowed to proceed for 5-6 hrs at 37\ufffd C. under a 5% CO2 atmosphere., 128863=The present patent application is a continuation-in-part application of copending provisional application Serial No. 60/175,801, filed Jan. 12, 2000., 294673=The instant compounds may also be useful in combination with an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-COA reductase) for the treatment of cancer. Compounds which have inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase can be readily identified by using assays well-known in the art. For example, see the assays described or cited in U.S. Pat. No. 4,231,938 at col. 6, and WO 84/02131 at pp. 30-33. The terms \u201cHMG-CoA reductase inhibitor\u201d and \u201cinhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase\u201d have the same meaning when used herein., 306855=4-Bromo-3-fluorobenzyl alcohol (20 g, 0.097 mol) was dissolved in DMF (100 mL) then placed under high vacuum for 15 min. The solution was then purged with Ar for 15 min. While purging continued, zinc cyanide (8 g, 0.068 mol) and the catalyst, Pd[(PPh3)]4, (5.63 g, 0.0049 mol) were added. The reaction mixture was heated at 95\ufffd C. under Ar for 18 h, then cooled to ambient temperature and added to H2O. The mixture was extracted with EtOAc, then washed with 1M HCl, H2O, brine, and dried (Na2SO4). Filtration and concentration to dryness gave the title compound as a white solid after chromatography (silica gel, hexane: EtOAc, 6.5:3.5)., 133709=Inhibitors of farnesyl-protein transferase (FPTase) have been described in two general classes. The first are analogs of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), while the second class of inhibitors is related to the protein substrates (e.g., Ras) for the enzyme. The peptide derived inhibitors that have been described are generally cysteine containing molecules that are related to the CAAX motif that is the signal for protein prenylation. (Schaber et al., ibid; Reiss et. al., ibid; Reiss et al., PNAS, 88:732-736 (1991)). Such inhibitors may inhibit protein prenylation while serving as alternate substrates for the farnesyl-protein transferase enzyme, or may be purely competitive inhibitors (U.S. Pat. No. 5,141,851, University of Texas; N. E. Kohl et al., Science, 260:1934-1937 (1993); Graham, et al., J. Med. Chem., 37, 725 (1994)). In general, deletion of the thiol from a CAAX derivative has been shown to dramatically reduce the inhibitory potency of the compound. However, the thiol group potentially places limitations on the therapeutic application of FPTase inhibitors with respect to pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and toxicity. Therefore, a functional replacement for the thiol is desirable., 326808=Magnesium (0.09 g, 3.61 mmol) was flame dried in a 50 mL RB flask equipped with addition funnel and magnetic stirrer under N2. When the flask had cooled, anhydrous THF (3 mL), a pinch of iodine, and a THF solution of Rieke magnesium (1 mL) were added, followed by a small portion of 1-(4-bromo-butoxymethyl)-3-tert-butoxy-benzene (1.134 g, 3.61 mmol) in THF (5 mL) with slight warming to initiate the reaction. The remainder of the bromide solution was added dropwise over 15 min. After 15 min. this Grignard solution was added to a solution of N-[(4-cyano-3-fluoro-phenyl)-(3-methyl-3H-imidazol-4-yl)-methylene]-2-methylpropanesulfinamide (Example 1, Step G) (0.30 g, 0.90 mmol) in THF (5 mL) with cooling in an ice-H2O bath. After 5 mL of Grignard solution was consumed, the reaction was complete by HPLC. The reaction mixture was quenched with H2O, diluted with saturated NaHCO3 solution and extracted with CH2Cl2 (2\ufffd20 mL). The organic layers were combined, washed with brine, dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated to give the crude product. Purification by RP LC on a Delta Prep Pak eluting with 95:5 to 5:95 H2O (0.1% TFA): CH3CN(0.1% TFA) gave both diastereomers in a 3.5:1 ratio after concentration of the fractions followed by a toluene azeotrope.
