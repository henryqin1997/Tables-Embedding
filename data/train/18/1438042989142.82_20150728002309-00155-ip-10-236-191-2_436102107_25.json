            "Description",
            "UNIVERSAL AUTOMOTIVE IGNITION PICKUP ASSEMBLY - The present invention is a Universal Automotive Ignition Pickup Assembly that produces an ignition secondary voltage waveform that can be monitored by an oscilloscope or microprocessor. This is accomplished with a sensing probe that can be capacitive coupled; inductively coupled; or capacitive and inductively coupled at the same time. Due to the ability of a pickup to be capacitive and inductive at the same time, the ignition voltage waveforms are clear and concise from secondary ignition wires to a multitude of different ignition coil types.",
            "VEHICLE DIAGNOSTIC TOOL - UTILIZING VOLUMETRIC EFFICIENCY - An analysis tool which extracts all the available parameter identifications (i.e. PIDS) from a vehicle's power train control module for diagnostic decisions. This is done by checking these PIDS and other information (e.g., calculated PIDS, Break Points, charts and algorithms) in three states; key on engine off, key on engine cranking, key on engine running. In all three modes the tool is comparing the live data from PIDS and voltage to the other information (e.g, Break Points). If any of this data are outside the programmed values a flag is assigned to the failure or control problem. The relationship between a particular PID and its associated preprogrammed value(s) may be indicated by a light. The depth of the problem (if any) is conveyed by the color of the light. Also included are tests/charts for fuel trim, engine volumetric efficiency, simulated injector, power, catalyst efficiency, and engine coolant range.",
            "LEAK DETECTION FORMULA, ANALYZER AND METHODS OF USE - Detecting a leak from a site in a sealed system with a source of pressurized gas which is capable of passing through the site, a composition of matter which adheres to the surfaces of the system and which is capable of showing the presence of the gas escaping from the site. The method includes: injecting gas into the system to a pressure in excess of the surrounding pressure, and covering the external surface with the composition to identify the location of the site by the interaction of the escaping gas with the composition. The composition is foam that includes a surfactant which forms a least one bubble in the presence of escaping gas and an indicator which changes color in the presence of the escaping gas. The leak is an opening down to at least the size of a hole 0.001\u2033 in diameter. A gas detector may also be used.",
            "SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ANALYZING CARBON BUILD UP IN AN ENGINE - An induction cleaning analyzing system includes a pressure sensor, an ignition event detector, and a control module. The pressure sensor measures airflow pressures of intake air and/or exhaust from cylinders in a common airflow pathway of a vehicle. The ignition event detector determines ignition events of the cylinders. The control module obtains pressure waveforms representative of the airflow pressures and divides the pressure waveforms into waveform segments. The control module associates different subsets of the waveform segments with different ones of the cylinders using the ignition events. The control module also identifies cyclic variations in the airflow pressures flowing in the common airflow pathway and caused by at least one of the cylinders by examining the waveform segments associated with the at least one of the cylinders.",

            "LEAK VERIFICATION AND DETECTION FOR VEHICLE FUEL CONTAINMENT SYSTEMS - An off-board vehicle fuel containment tester that utilizes a vacuum/pressure pump to change the pressure in the vehicle's fuel handling and containment system. A microprocessor is programmed to control the vacuum/pressure pump system and through the reading produced by a pressure transducer will determine, by the pressure changes occurring in the containment system, if a leak is present and the size of the leak. Once a leak is determined to be present, a gas analyzer that can detect carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons is used to find the point of leakage in the vehicle containment system."
