    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{173632=The protocol for testing the stabilizing qualities of the three compositions is as follows: the dye solutions were carefully, uniformly spread on steel plates to a thickness of approximately 0.1 mm. The plates were then immediately exposed to a medium pressure 1200 watt high intensity quartz arc mercury discharge lamp (Conrad-Hanovia, Inc., Newark, N.J.) at a distance of 30 cm from the lamp., 178929=In a 250 ml, three-necked, round bottomed flask fitted with an addition funnel, thermometer and magnetic stirrer was placed 30.0 g (0.076 mol) of the dehydrated phthaloylglycine-2959, 70 ml methanol and 20.1 ml hydrogen peroxide (30% solution). The reaction mixture was stirred and cooled in a water/ice bath to maintain a temperature in the range 15-20\ufffd C. 5.8 ml of a 6 N NaOH solution was placed in the addition funnel and the solution was slowly added to maintain the reaction mixture temperature of 15-20\ufffd C. This step took about 4 minutes. The mixture was then stirred for 3 hours at about 20-25\ufffd C. The reaction mixture was then poured into 90 ml of water and extracted with two 70 ml portions of ethyl ether. The organic layers were combined and washed with 100 ml of water, dried with anhydrous MgSO4 filtered, and the ether removed on a rotary evaporator to yield a white solid (yield 20.3 g, 65%). The IR showed the stretching of the C\u2014O\u2014C group and the material was used without further purification., 28906=The ability of a light source to cause photochemical change in a colorant is also dependent upon the spectral distribution of the light source, in particular the proportion of radiation of wavelengths most effective in causing a change in the colorant and the quantum yield of colorant degradation as a function of wavelength. On the basis of photochemical principles, it would be expected that light of higher energy (short wavelengths) would be more effective at causing fading than light of lower energy (long wavelengths). Studies have revealed that this is not always the case. Over 100 colorants of different classes were studied and found that generally the most unstable were faded more efficiently by visible light while those of higher lightfastness were degraded mainly by ultraviolet light (McLaren, K., J. Soc. Dyers Colour, 1956, 72, 86)., 97390=It is known to those of ordinary skill in the art that the dehydration by conventional means of the tertiary alcohols that are alpha to the carbonyl groups is difficult. One conventional reaction that can be used to dehydrate the phthaloylglycine-2959 is by reacting the phthaloylglycine-2959 in anhydrous benzene in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid. After refluxing the mixture, the final product is isolated. However, the yield of the desired dehydrated alcohol is only about 15 to 20% by this method., 261460=The results of this experiment were as follows. After three hours under the 1200 Watt lamp, the control was 40 to 50% bleached, while the inks containing the compound produced in Example 29 were unchanged. After nine hours, the control was 50 to 60% bleached while the inks containing the compound of Example 29 were only about 10 to 20% bleached. Accordingly, the compound produced in Example 29 is capable of stabilizing the dyes found in standard ink jet inks., 156084=This example describes a method of producing the ultraviolet radiation transorber 4(4-hydroxyphenyl)butan-2-one-2959 (chloro substituted)., 167038=As can be seen in Table 2, when phthaloylglycine-2959 was admixed with Victoria Pure Blue BO, the dye faded when exposed to the mercury dwascharge light. However, when dehydrated phthaloylglycine-2959 was admixed with the Victoria Pure Blue BO at a ratio of 10 parts dehydrated phthaloylglycine-2959 to one part Victoria Pure Blue BO, there was increased stabilization of the dye to light. When the ratio was 20 parts dehydrated phthaloylglycine-2959 to one part Victoria Pure Blue BO, the dye was substantially stabilized to the mercury dwascharge light in the time limits of the exposure., 196788=This example describes mutation or decolorization rates for the compositions of Examples 7 (wherein the \u03b2-cyclodextrin has dehydrated phthaloyl glycine-2959 from Example 4 covalently bonded thereto), 18 and 19., 28409=Under conditions of constant temperature it has been observed that an increase in the relative humidity of the atmosphere increases the fading of a colorant for a variety of colorant-substrate systems (e.g., McLaren, K., J. Soc. Dyers Colour, 1956, 72, 527). For example, as the relative humidity of the atmosphere increases, a fiber may swell because the moisture content of the fiber increases. This aids diffusion of gaseous reactants through the substrate structure., 284733=The cartridges containing the admixture are then placed back into their respective printers, and 150 color test sheets are generated by the printer. Sheets number 50 and number 100 are then fade tested by exposure to a medium pressure 1200 Watt Mercury Lamp. The sheets are affixed to a poster board with scotch tape, and then are placed approximately 18 inches directly under the lamp. The sheets are exposed for approximately eight hours and then visually compared with unexposed sheets to determine the percentage of fading. Table 15 provides the percent fade of the sheets produced by the Hewlett-Packard Desk Jet 1200C Color Printer, and Table 16 provides the percent face of the sheets produced by the Epson Stylus Color Printer (Model EscP2). The percentages following the identification of the compounds produced in Examples 29, 40, or 41 represent the percent of each compound in the ink composition (weight/weight). Also, \u201cN/C\u201d as used in Tables 15 and 16 represents \u201cno change\u201d., 186832=To a 100 ml round bottomed flask was placed 6.0 g \u03b2-cyclodextrin (American Maize Product Company), 10.0 g (0.05 mole) p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.), 50 ml of pH 10 buffer solution (Fisher). The resultant mixture was stirred at room temperature for 8 hours after which it was poured on ice (approximately 100 g) and extracted with diethyl ether. The aqueous layer was then poured into 50 ml of acetone (Fisher) and the resultant, cloudy mixture filtered. The resultant white powder was then run through a sephadex column (Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.) using n-butanol, ethanol, and water (5:4:3 by volume) as eluant to yield a white powder. The yield was 10.9%., 148662=This example describes a method of dehydrating the phthaloylglycine-2959 produced in Example 3., 160978=Solutions were prepared according to Table 2. The dye solutions were carefully, uniformly spread on steel plates to a thickness of approximately 0.1 mm. The plates were then immediately exposed to a medium pressure 1200 watt high intensity quartz arc mercury discharge lamp (Conrad-Hanovia, Inc., Newark, N.J.) at a distance of 30 cm from the light. The mercury discharge light is a source of high intensity, broad spectrum light that is used in accelerated fading analyses. Table 2 shows the results of the fade time with the various solutions. Fade time is defined as the time until the dye became colorless to the naked eye., 154905=This example describes a method of associating a colorant and an ultraviolet radiation transorber with a molecular includant. More particularly, this example describes a method of associating the colorant crystal violet with the molecular includant \u03b2-cyclodextrin covalently bonded to the ultraviolet radiation transorber dehydrated phthaloylglycine-2959 of Example 6., 152358=IR (KB)\u03bdmax 1758, 1708, 1677, 1600 cm\u22121, 184533=To a 500 ml 3-necked round bottomed flask fitted with a bubble tube, condenser and addition funnel, was placed 10 g (0.025 mole) of the dehydrated phthaloylglycine 2959 in 150 ml of anhydrous N,N-diethylformamide (Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.) cooled to 0\ufffd C. in an ice bath and stirred with a magnetic stirrer. The synthesis was repeated except that the flask was allowed to warm up to 60\ufffd C. using a warm water bath and the H2S pumped into the reaction flask till the stoppers started to move (trying to release the pressure). The flask was then stirred under these conditions for 4 hours. The saturated solution was kept at a positive pressure of H2S. The stoppers were held down by wiring and rubber bands. The reaction mixture was then allowed to warm-up overnight. The solution was then flushed with argon for 30 minutes and the reaction mixture poured onto 50 g of crushed ice and extracted three times (3\ufffd80 ml) with diethyl ether (Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.)., 193073=To a 250 ml round bottomed flask was added 10.0 g (4-8 mole) of tosylated substituted cyclodextrin, 20.7 g (4-8 mmol) of thiol (mercapto dehydrated phthaloylglycine 2959) in 100 ml of DMF. The reaction mixture was cooled to 0\ufffd C. in an ice bath and stirred using a magnetic stirrer. To the solution was slowly dropped in 10 ml of ethyl diisopropylamine (Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.) in 20 ml of DMF. The reaction was kept at 0\ufffd C. for 8 hours with stirring. The reaction mixture was extracted with diethyl ether. The aqueous layer was then treated with 500 ml of acetone and the precipitate filtered and washed with acetone. The product was then run on a sephadex column using n-butanol, ethanol, and water (5:4:3 by volume) to yield a white powder. The yield was 16.7 g., 254939=To a 500 ml round bottom flask fitted with a magnetic stir bar, and condensor, was placed 20 g (0.08 mole) of the composition prepared in Example 28, 17.8 g (0.08 mole) IRGACURE\ufffd 2959 (Ciba-Geigy, N.Y.), 0.5 g p-toluenesulfonic acid (Aldrich), and 300 ml anhydrous benzene (Aldrich). The Dean and Stark adapter was put on the flask and the reaction mixture heated at reflux for 8 hours after which point 1.5 ml of water had been collected (theo. 1.43 ml). The reaction mixture was then cooled and the solvent removed on a rotary evaporator to yield 35.4 g. The crude product was recrystalized from 30% ethyl acetate in hexane to yield 34.2 g (94%) of a white powder. The resulting reaction product had the following physical parameters:, 158403=The ultraviolet radiation transorber produced in this example, 4(4-hydroxyphenyl)butan-2-one-2959 (chloro substituted), may be associated with \u03b2-cyclodextrin and a colorant such as crystal violet, using the methods described above wherein 4(4-hydroxyphenyl)butan-2-one-2959 (chloro substituted) would be substituted for the dehydrated phthaloylglycine-2959., 78946=In one embodiment wherein the colorant and the ultraviolet radiation transorber are associated with the molecular includant, the colorant is crystal violet, the ultraviolet radiation transorber is a dehydrated phthaloylglycine-2959, and the molecular includant is \u03b2-cyclodextrin. In yet another embodiment wherein the colorant and the ultraviolet radiation transorber are associated with the molecular includant, the colorant is crystal violet, the ultraviolet radiation transorber is 4(4-hydroxyphenyl) butan-2-one-2959 (chloro substituted), and the molecular includant is \u03b2-cyclodextrin., 177840=Preparation of Epeoxide Intermediate of Dehydrated Phthaloylglycine-2959, 93988=This dehydrated phthaloylglycine-2959 is capable of light-stabilizing a colorant. Thus, it is believed that removal of the functional group alpha to the carbonyl carbon on any photoreactor molecule will impart the light-stabilizing capability to the molecule. While the dehydrated ultraviolet radiation transorber can impart light-stability to a colorant simply by mixing the molecule with the colorant, it has been found that the molecule is much more efficient at stabilizing colorants when it is attached to an includant, such as cyclodextrin, as described herein., 262242=The forty-eighth sheet (test sheet) was generated using the ink solutions (1) through (4) of Example 36 each containing about 10% of the compound of Example 29, and was then exposed to a 1200 Watt lamp along with a control sheet (generated from the commercially available ink from the cartridges before the compound of Example 29 was added). The sheets were monitored each hour of exposure and \u201cfade\u201d was determined by the eye against an unexposed sheet. The results of exposing the sheets to the 1200 Watt lamp are summarized in Table 13, where NC=no change., 253100=The method of Example 29 was followed except that 5.0 g of the 4-[4\u2032-carboxy phenyl]-3-buten-2-one was used. More particularly, 5.0 g (0.026 mole) of the 4-[4\u2032-carboxy phenyl]-3-buten-2-one produced in Example 30 was reacted with 3.3 g (0.026 mole) of oxalyl chloride in anyhydrous DMF at about 0\ufffd C. Next, approximately 7.1 g (0.005 mole) hydroxyethyl substituted cyclodextrin was added to the mixture (5:1 ratio) under the conditions described in Example 30 and was further processed as described therein; to produce 10.8 g of white powder. The NMR of the product showed both the aromatic protons of the 4-[4\u2032-carboxy phenyl]3-buten-2-one produced in Example 30 and the glucose protons of the cyclodextrin., 261079=The cartridges were then refilled with the corresponding ink solutions (1) through (4) above. Forty pages were run off, and the fortieth page was exposed to a 1200 Watt medium pressure mercury lamp with a control sheet for nine hours. The control sheet is the fortieth color test page run off using the ink compositions that were in the original ink cartridges., 204156=This example further demonstrates the ability of the present invention to stabilize colorants against light. The two compounds containing Victoria Pure Blue BO as an includant in the cyclodextrin cavity were tested for light fastness under a medium pressure mercury discharge lamp. 100 mg of each compound was dissolved in 20 ml of acetonitrile and was uniformly spread on steel plates to a thickness of approximately 0.1 mm. The plates were then immediately exposed to a medium pressure 1200 watt high intensity quartz arc mercury discharge lamp (Conrad-Hanovia Inc., Newark, N.J.) at a distance of 30 cm from the lamp. The light fastness results of these compounds are summarized in Table 7., 172654=This example demonstrates the capability of dehydrated phthaloylglycine-2959 bound to \u03b2-cyclodextrin to stabilize dyes against light. The Victoria Pure Blue BO associated with the radiation transorber, as discussed in the examples above, was tested to determine its capability to stabilize the associated dye against light emitted from a mercury discharge light. In addition, the Victoria Pure Blue BO alone and Victoria Pure Blue BO admixed with \u03b2-cyclodextrin were tested as controls. The compositions tested were as follows:, 168798=20 parts by weight of the hydroxy and the dehydroxy 2959 were admixed separately to one part by weight of Victoria Pure Blue BO in acetonitrile. The dye solutions were cwerefully uniformly spread on steel plates to a thickness of approximately 0.1 mm. The plates were then immediately exposed to a mercury discharge light at a distance of 30 cm from the light. The mercury discharge light is a source of high intensity, broad spectrum light that is used in accelerated fading analyses. Table 3 shows the results of the fade time with the various solutions. Fade time is defined as the time until the dye became colorless to the naked eye., 101882=An important requirement in performing the Nohr-MacDonald elimination reaction is that the reaction be run at a relatively high temperature. The reaction is desirably performed at a temperature of between approximately 80\ufffd C. and 150\ufffd C. A suitable temperature for dehydrating phthaloylglycine-2959 is approximately 124\ufffd C. The time the reaction runs is not critical. The reaction should be run between approximately 30 minutes to 4 hours. However, depending upon the reactants and the solvent used, the timing may vary to achieve the desired yield of product., 152673=This example describes a method of producing a \u03b2-cyclodextrin having dehydrated phthaloylglycine-2959 groups from Example 4 or 5 covalently bonded thereto., 148282=The resulting product, designated phthaloylglycine-2959, had the following physical parameters:, 84949=The term \u201cincoherent, pulsed ultraviolet radiation\u201d has reference to the radiation produced by a dielectric barrier discharge excimer lamp (referred to hereinafter as \u201cexcimer lamp\u201d). Such a lamp is described, for example, by U. Kogelschatz, \u201cSilent discharges for the generation of ultraviolet and vacuum ultraviolet excimer radiation,\u201d Pure & Appl. Chem., 62, No. 9, pp. 1667-1674 (1990); and E. Eliasson and U. Kogelschatz, \u201cUV Excimer Radiation from Dielectric-Barrier Discharges,\u201d Appl. Phys. B, 46, pp 299-303 (1988). Excimer lamps were developed originally by ABB Infocom Ltd., Lenzburg, Switzerland. The excimer lamp technology since has been acquired by Har\ufffdus Noblelight AG, Hanau, Germany., 25163=This application is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/983,159, filed on Dec. 29, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,033,465, which is a national phase application of International Application PCT/US96/04689, filed on Apr. 5, 1996, which claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/000,570, filed on Jun. 28, 1995, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 08/183,683, filed on Jan. 19, 1994, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/119,912, filed Sep. 10, 1993, both now abandoned;, 155293=The following was placed in a 100 ml beaker: 4.0 g \u03b2-cyclodextrin having a dehydrated phthaloylglycine-2959 group; and 50 ml of water. The water was heated to 70\ufffd C. at which point the solution became clear. Next, 0.9 g (2.4 mmole) crystal violet (Aldrich Chemical Company, Milwaukee, Wis.) was added to the solution, and the solution was stirred for 20 minutes. Next, the solution was then filtered. The filtrand was washed with the filtrate and then dried in a vacuum oven at 84\ufffd C. A violet-blue powder was obtained having 4.1 g (92%) yield. The resulting reaction product had the following physical parameters:, 146335=This example describes a method of preparing an ultraviolet radiation transorber, 2-[p-(2-methyllactoyl)phenoxy]ethyl 1,3-dioxo-2-isoindolineacetate, designated phthaloylglycine-2959., 258273=In compositions (2) through (5), the compositions contained one part Victoria Pure Blue BO per 20 parts of the compounds produced in the above examples. More particularly, 0.1 g of Victoria Pure Blue BO was mixed with approximately 2.0 g of one of the compounds produced in the above examples, in 10 ml of acetonitrile. The mixtures were drawn down using a #8 bar and allowed to air dry in a ventilation hood. All of the plates were simultaneously exposed to the 1200 Watt mercury lamp for one hour. Each plate was half covered with aluminum foil during exposure to the lamp to maintain a reference point with respect to fading of the colorant. After one hour under the lamp, mixture (1) had gone colorless, while mixtures (2) through (5) all remained unchanged., 30387=The purity of the substrate is also an important consideration whenever the photochemistry of dyed technical polymers is considered. For example, technical-grade cotton, viscose rayon, polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyisoprene are known to contain carbonyl group impurities. These impurities absorb light of wavelengths greater than 300 nm, which are present in sunlight, and so, excitation of these impurities may lead to reactive species capable of causing colorant fading (van Beek, H. C. A., Col. Res. Appl., 1983, 8(3), 176)., 256389=The plates were exposed to a 1200 Watt Mercury medium pressure lamp for one hour, the lamp being about 2 feet from the plates. After one hour, the Victoria Pure Blue BO plate was essentially colorless, while the plate having the mixture of Victoria Pure Blue BO and 4-[4\u2032-carboxy phenyl]-3-buten-2-one thereon had not changed., 158247=IR [NUJOL MULL] \u03bdmax 3460, 1760, 1700, 1620, 1600 cm\u22121, 150386=IR (NUJOL) \u03bdmax 1617 cm\u22121 (C\u2550C\u2014C\u2550O), 148397=IR [NUJOL MULL] \u03bdmax 3440, 1760, 1740, 1680, 1600 cm\u22121, 150518=This example describes the Nohr-MacDonald elimination reaction used to dehydrate the phthaloylglycine-2959 produced in Example 5 ., 154580=The \u03b2-cyclodextrin molecule has several primary alcohols and secondary alcohols with which the phthaloylglycine-2959 can react. The above representative reaction only shows a single phthaloylglycine-2959 molecule for illustrative purposes., 256802=A further experiment to determine the colorant stabilizing capability of the 4-[4\u2032-carboxy phenyl]-3-buten-2-one produced in Example 30 is as follows. The experiment used in Example 33 was repeated except that no carbowax was used. Instead, the materials were dissolved in acetonitrile and a film formed, allowed to dry, and then exposed to the 1200 Watt lamp. Again, after one hour, the dye (Victoria Pure Blue BO) was essentially colorless while the mixture containing the 4-[4\u2032-carboxy phenyl]-3-buten-2-one was unchanged in color., 95916=Other photoreactors can be modified according to the present invention to provide stabilizers for dyes. These photoreactors include, but are not limited to: 1-Hydroxy-cyclohexyl-phenyl ketone (\u201cHCPK\u201d) (IRGACURE 184, Ciba-Geigy); \u03b1,\u03b1-dimethoxy-\u03b1-hydroxy acetophenone (DAROCUR 1173, Merck); 1-(4-Isopropylphenyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-propan-1-one (DAROCUR 1116, Merck); 1-[4-(2-Hydroxyethoxy)phenyl]-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-propan-1-one (IRGACURE\ufffd 2959, Merck); Poly[2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-[4-(1-methylvinyl)phenyl] propan-1-one ] (ESACURE KIP, Fratelli Lamberti); Benzoin (2-Hydroxy-1,2-diphenylethanone) (ESACURE BO, Fratelli Lamberti); Benzoin ethyl ether (2-Ethoxy-1,2-diphenylethanone) (DAITOCURE EE, Siber Hegner); Benzoin isopropyl ether (2-Isopropoxy-1,2-diphenylethanone) (VICURE 30, Stauffer); Benzoin n-butyl ether (2-Butoxy-1,2-diphenylethanone) (ESACURE EBI, Fratelli Lamberti); mixture of benzoin butyl ethers (TRIGONAL 14, Akzo); Benzoin iso-butyl ether (2-Isobutoxy-1,2-diphenylethanone) (VICURE 10, Stauffer); blend of benzoin n-butyl ether and benzoin isobutyl ether (ESACURE EB3, ESACURE EB4, Fratelli Lamberti); Benzildimethyl ketal (2,2-Dimethoxy-1,2-diphenylethanone) (\u201cBDK\u201d) (IRGACURE 651, Ciba-Geigy); 2,2-Diethoxy-1,2-diphenylethanone (UVATONE 8302, Upjohn); \u03b1,\u03b1-Diethoxyacetophenone (2,2-Diethoxy-1-phenyl-ethanone) (\u201cDEAP\u201d, Upjohn), (DEAP, Rahn); and \u03b1,\u03b1-Di-(n-butoxy)-acetophenone (2,2-Dibutoxyl-1-phenylethanone) (UVATONE 8301, Upjohn).}",
