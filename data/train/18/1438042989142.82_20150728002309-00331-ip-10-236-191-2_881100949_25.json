Compared to a university, it is very cheap. There is also a board of governors wavier that one could apply for in order to have their classes paid for. One just has to show that they financially struggling., 30491=I would check out some other junior colleges in the area as well. Like Palomar or RCC. MSJC is a good school, its just really impacted and hard to get into classes. It would probably be a good idea to register for classes at a couple different places if you can, or just be okay with the fact that an AA/AS could take you 3 - 5 years., 159767=Class units cost $48 as of Oct. 2012. Way more affordable than starting off at a University. Pay close attention to which units transfer and which don't., 117121=As of now they are asking i believe $36 a unit which is just over $100 a class which is a whole lot cheaper for your general education then if you were going to a Four-year institution paying almost a $1000 or more per class. I say your going to get more band for your buck here then at a Four-year, 277808=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 104405=Units will increase beginning Fall 2012 to $49 a unit}",
