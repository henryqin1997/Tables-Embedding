Themes The AsciiDoc theme attribute is used to select an alternative CSS stylesheet and to optionally include additional JavaScript code. Theme files reside in an AsciiDoc configuration directory named themes/<theme>/ (where <theme> is the the theme name set by the theme attribute). asciidoc(1) sets the themedir attribute to the theme directory path name. The theme attribute can also be set using the asciidoc(1) --theme option, the --theme option can also be used to manage theme plugins. AsciiDoc ships with two themes: flask and volnitsky.
