For example, John 1:1 uses eijmiv with a singular count noun. Using the above statistics alone would mean the text would support the Jehovah Witnesses and their interpretation of that passage. However, below we demonstrate a contextually closer concentric circle to John 1:1 that is more determinative in it\u2019s interpretation than this statistical phenomenon regarding the entire NT. Therefore, it is wise to reserve a semantic judgment until the book from which the verse arises has been statistically tallied. So although it is true that the predominant semantic for a singular count noun minus all definitizing factors in a pre-copulative anarthrous PN construct with eijmiv is statistically higher for the I-Q category, this is not the entire case for each book or author of the NT., 276033=15 Colwell, \u201cA Definite Rule,\u201d 13; See A. T. Robertson, A Grammar of the Greek New Testament in The Light of Historical Research, 4th ed. (Nashville, Tenn: Broadman Press, 1934), 768-69, 794. It must be noted that Colwell used Robertson\u2019s 3rd edition, but the pages on this matter are identical., 118390=The most significant decreases evidence themselves in both the D-Q and D categories as should be expected. With this decrease the particular semantic situation for eijmiv emerges. The predominant semantic lies with the I-Q category (52%) followed by the Q category (36%), the indefinite category (6%) and finally the D-Q category (3%). The old semantic scheme would be the following: 6% definite, 6% indefinite and 88% qualitative.98 However, this later scheme does not reveal the I-Q category and is a bit deceptive. Before we jump ahead and apply this to John 1:1, however, a look at the post-copulative construction is necessary to conclude the study for the NT., 294268=53 He states, \u201cThe categories of qualitativeness and definiteness \u2026 are not mutually exclusive, and frequently it is a delicate exegetical issue for the interpreter to decide which emphasis a Greek writer had in mind.\u201d However, he then goes on to state regarding John 1:1 that \u201cthe qualitative force of the predicate is so prominent that the noun cannot be regarded as definite\u201d (Harner, \u201cQualitative Anarthrous Predicate Nouns: Mark 15:39 and John 1:1,\u201d 87). Kuhne, however, misunderstands Harner, at this point, to indicate indefiniteness as the only alternative. See Kuehne, \u201cA Postscript to Colwell's Rule and John 1:1,\u201d 22. It is clear, however, that Harner did not indicate by his statement that indefiniteness was the only alternative to the lexeme. He appears rather to indicate precisely the opposite\u2014that the lexeme became purely qualitative excluding either definiteness or indefiniteness altogether., 288736=44 Harner, \u201cQualitative Anarthrous Predicate Nouns: Mark 15:39 and John 1:1,\u201d 78-87., 265895=17:17, 292083=49 Harner, \u201cQualitative Anarthrous Predicate Nouns: Mark 15:39 and John 1:1,\u201d 83., 217765=The significance of this appears to be exemplified in what is called the principle of maximum redundancy.110 In other words, structures that are in parallel are more likely to reflect the same rather than different semantic nuances. In other words, if one fails to come to grips with the qualitative aspects argued throughout this paper from a grammatical point of view, then the discourse connection between 1:1 and 1:14 is left to disambiguate any misapprehensions up to this point. We simply refer to this as a confirmation of the semantic which we have arrived at quite independently of this additional observation., 271148=19:31, 317103=(3) He includes in his examples of non-count nouns from John\u2019s Gospel proper names (6:42; 8:39; 10:22 [?]; 11:2; 20:14), count nouns (1:49; 6:42; 8:37, 42, 54; 9:5; 13:30; 8:10; 19:21, 31) but only two, mass nouns (6:55a, 55b), thus illustrating his confusion as to what constitutes either count or mass. Besides this he fails to have either an exhaustive list in John\u2019s Gospel of both pre and post-copulative anarthrous constructions, or clear passages by which to make semantical statistical predictions on disputed texts (see appendix on John). There appears to be no scientific rationale to his appendix at all. The only axiom he has demonstrated is that relying on context to determine whether a noun is count is surely a subjective enterprise., 259261=10:22, 252698=9:24, 250039=9:5, 50070=Relation of hyponyms. The second question we want to focus on is this: What relation does oJ lovgo\" in John 1:1 occupy in relation to the Father if the PN qeov\" is the overarching category (superordinate) to which each hyponym (Word and Father) belong? In other words, if we assume that qeov\" in 1:1 always denotes, whether it is referring to the Father or the Word, the same characteristics, then we must assume they are within the same superordinate, and thus must ask what relationship they exercise in regards to each other. Do they exhibit an overlapping, contiguous, or inclusive relationship? In other words, if we assume that the proposition kaiV qeoV\" h oJ lovgo\" is a subset type proposition where qeov\" occupies the paradigmatic slot of superordinate, while oJ lovgo\" occupies the paradigmatic slot of hyponym, then the question focuses on the relationship between the Father (assumed from context) and oJ lovgo\" (1:1c) to qeov\" (1:1c)., 243479=8:34, 34148=Thereafter Colwell\u2019s conclusions were accepted nearly unanimously in the scholarly world.38 Many evangelicals, because of the implications to John 1:1, unwittingly assumed, as Metzger did, the converse of Colwell\u2019s rule which led to its abuse.39 His actual rule states, \u201cDefinite predicate nouns which precede the verb usually lack the article.\u201d40 This statement, however, was taken to imply that anarthrous predicate nominatives that precede the verb are usually definite.41 This type of abuse bled into the commentaries on John as well. Later research seriously questioned this consensus of opinion by attempting to demonstrate that pre-copulative anarthrous PNs were predominately qualitative in nature,42 a fact not considered seriously enough within the semantic range of some, including Colwell.43, 281642=30 For the classic essay on the category mistake see Gilbert Ryle, \u201cDescartes\u2019 Myth,\u201d in 20th-Century Philosophy: The Analytic Tradition, ed. Morris Weitz, Readings in the History of Philosophy, eds. Paul Edwards and Richard H. Popkin (New York: The Free Press, 1966), 298-309. Colwell had stated earlier that definiteness was established by context and made no mention, to the contrary, that definiteness was established by a nominal's occurrence elsewhere in an articluar construction (Colwell, \u201cA Definite Rule,\u201d 20-21). It is this latter criterion that he uses for John 1:1c citing John 20:28 as his validation for definiteness. But this is a clear violation of his own methodology of establishing definiteness in his rule., 248073=8:48, 238868=6:42, 256630=10:2, 29123=Third, Colwell appears to be responsible, because of his application to John 1:1, for laying the groundwork of a logical blunder.31 Colwell\u2019s rule \u201cDefinite predicate nominatives that precede the verb usually lack the article\u201d came to be seen as \u201cAnarthrous predicate nominatives that precede the verb are usually definite.\u201d We have affirmed, based on our study, that Colwell\u2019s original rule is valid but the converse of his rule is inductively falsifiable. In fact our study confirms that within the NT as a whole, this semantic category (definiteness) is certainly not the expected nuance of the construction, and not the predominant sense when it comes to singular count nouns as well. Thus this converse is neither true of the whole nor of its parts. So although definiteness is a possible semantic category, it is certainly not the probable one regarding anarthrous constructions. In addition, although the converse of Colwell\u2019s rule is not formally illogical, it is inductively falsifiable.32, 31744=Fifth, his initial conclusion of definiteness, in regards to John 1:49, did not take into consideration other factors which make the noun definite independent of word order, like the presence of genitive adjuncts.35 Therefore, many of what he considers definite PNs in the pre-copulative construction can be attributed to other factors besides the transferal leap he makes, requiring semantic congruity based on its articular occurrence in post-copulative constructs. It is here that another methodological fallacy emerges. Grammatical analysis must carefully identify, within the batch of samples, any factors that would tend to slant the conclusions towards a predicted outcome independent of the actual focus of study. Thus Colwell should have omitted PNs which had genitive adjuncts, proper names, or monadic nouns\u2014for these factors tend to definitize the head noun. Conversely, factors influencing the opposite semantic category should be omitted as well. Thus qualitative nouns should be identified and omitted from contaminating the statistical pool towards that semantic nuance.36 It is the construction that we wish to understand, and its affect upon the semantics of the noun, a noun which has the possibility of multiple semantic options, that can bring out the semantic predilection of the construction itself. In short, the samples must be free of semantic bias. Colwell\u2019s study fell short in this area., 215615=There are four occurrences of mass nouns that occur in the pre-copulative anarthrous PN construction (1:14; 2:9; 6:17; 16:20). Two of these cases can be excluded from the study either because it is a predicate accusative (2:9), or because it has a prepositional phrase (16:20). With this in mind we have two verses left to examine in light of our hypothesis (1:14; 6:17). With regards to 6:17 it reads, kaiV skotiva h[dh ejgegovnei, \u201cAnd it was already dark.\u201d Although this can be related back to 6:16, wJ\" deV ojyiva, \u201cWhen evening came . . .\u201d it appears that the semantic requirements are lacking. In other words, the semantic ambiguity of either PN is not in dispute. Both utilize the same verb. A better scenario would involve ideally a mass noun in a pre-copulative anarthrous construction with givnomai in connection with an ambiguous singular count noun with the verb eijmiv. This ideal condition is fulfilled only once in John (1:1c, 14)., 290361=47 In Mark he finds 8 examples (Mk 2:28; 3:35; 6:49; 11:17, 32; 12:35; 14:70; 15:39). See Harner, \u201cQualitative Anarthrous Predicate Nouns: Mark 15:39 and John 1:1,\u201d 76-81. He then focuses on the Gospel of John of which he spots 53 occurrences of pre-copulative anarthrous PNs (Harner, 82-3)., 292755=51 Harner, \u201cQualitative Anarthrous Predicate Nouns: Mark 15:39 and John 1:1,\u201d 87. However, he does leave open whether he regards this qualitativenss as predominately qualitative, thus some form of I-Q (Q-I), or whether he views it as purely Q. He obviously has rejected the definite semantic that Colwell sets forth for this verse. We have distinguished between all these semantic categories., 264585=12:50, 11482=In 1933 Ernest Cadmen Colwell wrote his celebrated article on \u201cA Definite Rule for the Use of the Article in the Greek New Testament\u201d in which he claimed, \u201cDefinite predicate nouns which precede the verb usually lack the article.\u201d6 This brief assertion, spawning as the exception to regular articular definite nouns, respected the predictability of anarthrous but definite PNs that precedes the copulative verb\u2014it is better known as Colwell\u2019s rule. Since this monumental article is the basis for what follows, and is the object of much abuse, it is therefore incumbent to allow Colwell to speak for himself and then follow this by pointing out both the legitimacy of Colwell\u2019s rule, as well as the methodological assumptions and/or flaws that pre-determined its outcome. The consensus that followed his article will be briefly noted along with the misunderstandings that have come to be associated with it. This historical evaluation will then prepare the way for an entirely different methodological approach from which to better treat the construction itself., 46459=Type of proposition. In determining sense relations we want to focus on two questions. The first question pertains to what type of relationship exists between the S and the PN. Using John 1:1 as a guide the question is, What relation does the S, oJ lovgo\" occupy in relation to the PN qeov\" in John 1:1c? If it is an overlapping relation or proper synonymy then the S = PN and PN = S, thus it is a convertible proposition. But if the referent to qeov\" has been contextually determined to be the Father (1:1a, 1b) then the referent to which the convertible sense inevitably points to is the Father only. Thus the lovgo\" = qeov\" (the Father) which amounts to Sabellianism. In other words, although the sense does not necessarily mean that the Word = the Father, the context determines that qeov\" has been used (twice) to refer to the Father. And if the proposition is determined to be convertible, there is no other contextual (extralingual) referent to infer otherwise as to who qeov\" would be but the Father., 312778=104 The post-copulative articular mass are the following: 6:35, 41, 48, 50, 51a, 58; 11:25a, 25b; 14:6b, 6c; 17:3; The post-copulative articular count are as follows: 1:20, 25a, 25c, 34, 49a; 3:10, 19, 28; 4:29, 42; 6:14, 29, 39, 40; 7:26, 40, 41; 8:12, 44e; 9:19, 20; 10:7, 9, 11, 14, 24; 11:27; 14:6a; 15:1a, 5, 12; 18:33; 20:31; 21:24., 38656=Harner goes on to illustrate the semantic possibilities as syntactically available at the time to rule out some of the interpretive options to John 1:1. He lists five options in all. (1) oJ qeov\" h oJ lovgo\", represents a convertible proposition\u2014leads to Sabellianism. (2) qeoV\" h oJ lovgo\", represents a subset proposition\u2014the word has the nature of deity rather than something else. (3) oJ lovgo\" qeoV\" h , represents a subset proposition\u2014the word, rather than something else, has the nature of deity.50 (4) oJ lovgo\" h qeoV\", represents a subset proposition\u2014a god distinct but belonging to the same category of deity (Mormonism/Arianism). (5) oJ lovgo\" h qei'o\", represents a subset proposition\u2014either a god or God having the attributes of deity (could support monotheism or polytheism). Regarding John 1:1 he concludes, \u201cI think that the qualitative force of the predicate is so prominent that the noun cannot be regarded as definite.\u201d51, 313894=107 Count\u20141:12; 6:17; 12:36. Mass\u2014John 1:14; 2:9 (pred. acc); 6:17; 16:20 (eij\")., 303062=80 Anarthrous constructions include: Gal 5:22a; 1 Tim 1:5; 1 John 4:8, 16. Articular constructions include: 1 John 5:3; 2 John 1:6a., 313616=106 Post-copulative anarthrous count are as follows: 1:25b, 40, 42; 4:18; 5:9; 6:42; 8:55; 9:14, 28b; 10:1b, 8b, 12; 11:38; 18:13a, 13b, 40; 19:38. The post-copulative mass are as follows: 6:55a, 55b., 177484=First we want to list the total semantic picture of an anarthrous PN with the verb eijmiv, then divert to consider both pre-copulative and post-copulative occurrences. Mass, plural counts as well as definitizing factors will be ruled out eventually and then an overall semantic situation will be presented regarding singular count nouns. As noted above, disputed passages have been kept out of the statistical tabulations below, i.e., 6 passages were kept out of these statistics (1:1c, 49b; 4:19; 9:17; 10:33, 36)., 249378=8:55, 263278=11:51, 326678=\u00a9 2015 Bible.org All Rights Reserved, 288882=45 Harner, \u201cQualitative Anarthrous Predicate Nouns: Mark 15:39 and John 1:1,\u201d 78., 230240=1:40, 260613=10:34, 267872=18:18, 298491=63 Various sources have been utilized for the study on mass nouns.

We start with the Gospel and its use of the verb ePm8. Since John 1:1c uses this verb, we will confine ourselves to looking at the statistical picture both pre and post copulative in regards to count/mass nouns. According to our calculations, the verb appears 121 times in convertible propositions. Of these 52 (43%) are articular constructions and 69 (57%) are anarthrous. Of the articular constructions 7 (13%) are pre-copulative of which 1 (17%) is mass and 6 (83%) are count.103 The 45 (87%) remaining are post-copulative of which 11 (24%) are mass and 34 (76%) are count.104 Of the 69 anarthrous constructions, 50 (72%) are pre-copulative and 19 (28%) are post-copulative occurrences. In respect to the pre-copulative anarthrous occurrences, 42 (84%) are count and 8 (16%) are mass.105 The post-copulative reveals 17 (89%) count and 2 (11%) mass nouns.106 Up front, however, we mark as exegetically disputed texts 1:1c, 49b, 4:19, 9:17 and 10:33, 36. Each of these are in the Colwell construction and are singular count nouns., 13269=He began with John 1:49 where both a post-copulative articular construction and a pre-copulative anarthrous construction were used with apparent semantic equivalence, i.e., with definiteness. Contextually the verse is the affirmation of Nathaniel to Jesus in response to the latter\u2019s ability to supernaturally see him under a fig tree. Nathaniel exclaims, rJabbiv, suV ei oJ uiJoV\" qeou', suV basileuV\" ei tou' jIsrahvl (1:49b). Colwell asked himself, \u201cWhat reason is there for this difference\u201d [i.e., semantical, grammatical or syntactical between the two PN constructions in suV ei oJ uiJoV\" qeou' and suV basileuV\" ei tou' jIsrahvl]? When the passage is scrutinized, it appears at once that the variable quantum is not definiteness but word-order.\u201d8 Therefore, according to Colwell, \u201cIt seems probable that the article is used with \u2018Son of God\u2019 because it follows the verb, and it is not used with \u2018King of Israel\u2019 because it precedes the verb.\u201d9 Confining himself to instances where the copula was expressed he states a rule: \u201cA definite predicate nominative has the article when it follows the verb; it does not have the article when it precedes the verb.\u201d10, 280369=23 His list is as follows: Lu 4:41; John 1:21; 6:51; 15:1; 2 Pet 1:17; Rom 4:13; 1 Cor 9:1, 2; 11:3, 25; 2 Cor 1:12; 3:2, 17; Rev 19:8; 20:14 (see Colwell, \u201cA Definite Rule,\u201d 18)., 286602=42 Harner, \u201cQualitative Anarthrous Predicate Nouns: Mark 15:39 and John 1:1,\u201d 75-87; and Dixon, \u201cThe Significance of the Anarthrous Predicate Nominative in John.\u201d, 242825=8:33, 270495=19:21, 230910=1:42, 269835=18:40, 284184=38 See Bruce Metzger, \u201cOn the Translation of John i:1,\u201d ExpTim 63 (1951-52), 125-26. He states, for example, that \u201cthey [sic] show that a predicate noun which precedes the verb cannot be translated as an indefinite or a \u2018qualitative\u2019 noun solely because of the absence of the article . . . the absence of the article does not make the predicate nominative indefinite or qualitative when it precedes the verb\u201d (125)., 314084=108 John 4:14; 15:8., 65665=Class C nouns are mass nouns that are mass in their singular but become either semantically different in the plural or a substantive. This type of noun includes only 7 of which ajgaphv is a representative.80 Examples include John 4:8 where it states, oJ qeoV\" ajgavph ejstivn. \u201cGod is love.\u201d Or another passage, 1 Timothy 1:5 states, toV deV tevlo\" th'\" paraggeliva\" ejstiVn ajgavph, \u201cBut the end of the commandment is love.\u201d The plural form of ajgaphv carries with it the substantive usage of \u201cbeloved ones\u201d elsewhere in the NT. Further, dovxa in the singular refers to \u201cglory\u201d whereas in the plural it usually takes on the substantized usage meaning \u201cglorious ones\u201d or, as class B nouns, it retains it\u2019s semantic singularity. In all PN constructions, however, the singular referred to the mass usage., 303257=81 Actually there are a total of 26 occurrences of PN constructions, articular and anarthrous, involving proper names in the NT. In 3 instances it is articular post-copulative (Matt 13:39b; Acts 7:37a; Rev 20:2b); 19 instances it is post-copulative anarthrous (Matt 11:14; 14:2; 16:18; 27:37; Lu 1:19; 9:30a, 30b; John 1:25b, 40, 42; 6:42; Acts 9:5; 22:8; 26:15; 1 Cor 3:11; Gal 4:24b; 1 Tim 1:20a, 20b), one instance with givnomai (Rom 9:29b); 4 cases involve anarthrous pre-copulative constructions (Mk 6:15; John 1:21a; 8:39a), and one with the verb givnomai (Rom 9:29a). For a discussion on instances of pre-copulative anarthrous proper names see Hartley, \u201cCriteria for Determining Qualitative Nouns,\u201d 60-2. For a different perspective on John\u2019s usage see G. D. Fee, \u201cThe Use of the Definite Article with Personal Names in the Gospel of John,\u201d NTS 17 (1970-71): 168-83., 317890=(4) Finally, his whole semantic treatment proceeds on a misunderstanding of Harner that Q = I-Q. Harner, as was shown above, simply noted that qualitativeness was not inimical to indefiniteness thus opening the possibility for a category of I-Q or Q-I. That this is to be understood as all Q = I-Q (Q-I), is absurd, illogical and a misunderstanding and abuse of Harner\u2019s study. Thus all his semantic categories (except 11:38 which he lists as indefinite) are tagged as Q-I (our I-Q). It is not surprising, then, not to see any reference to nor examples of mass nouns in his discussion. It would be quite absurd, for example, to insist on a Q-I category for such cases as John 3:6a, where it reads, toV gegennhmevnon ejk th'\" sarkoV\" savrx ejstin, \u201cThat which is born of the flesh is flesh.\u201d However, he expresses that his readers might be surprised that savrx ejstin it is not listed as Q-I! But he is quick to assure his readers that \u201ccontext\u201d doesn\u2019t support that determination. Thus by omitting any real discussion on mass nouns, he conveniently disregards the issue of a purely qualitative noun (without indefiniteness involved at all) from entering the discussion. And since it doesn\u2019t enter the discussion, the fallacy of Q = Q-I continues to exercise sole influence over his understanding of John 1:1c., 311402=101 It was stated earlier that a givnomai verb could not have a definite semantic. However, we have listed one which has, due to the low frequency of this verb, disrupted the semantic situation a bit. If we exclude Luke 2:2 from the semantic situation of singular count nouns and list it as disputed, then the semantic situation would be as follows: 72% I-Q and 28% Q. According to the old scheme it would be 100% Q., 37274=He next turned his attention to John\u2019s Gospel where he found fifty three occurrences of the construction PN + V. He limited his focus to a handful of examples including John 1:1 kaiV qeoV\" h oJ lovgo\". He first showed, as earlier with Mark, that John was familiar with other ways of structurally expressing the qualitative sense indicated in the formula V + PN. He uses this construction eighteen times with only one exception to the rule. Harner also indicates that John is equally familiar as Mark to the structural options possible for expressing definiteness indicated in the formula V + PN. He uses this particular construction some sixty times. Out of these, Harner viewed forty to be predominantly qualitative, over both indefinite and definite, as the primary or exclusive meaning. After examining a few passages (1:14; 8:31; 9:24) he concludes that \u201cJohn used this type of syntactical construction in essentially the same way as Mark.\u201d49 However, it should be recognized that Harner did not make any distinction between mass and count nouns as seen in his treatment of John 1:14. Again, the fact that \u201cflesh\u201d is mass makes it qualitative irregardless of the construction, thus it is lexically qualitative irrespective to syntax., 305110=85 James Hope Moulton, A Grammar of New Testament Greek, vol. 3 Syntax, by Nigel Turner (Edinburgh: T. & T. Clark, 1963), 177., 261282=10:36, 304611=84 It is always dangerous to impose a thought process upon the biblical material based upon the kinds of words used. For an extreme example of this see Thorleif Bowman, Hebrew Thought Compared with Greek, (New York: W. W. Norton & Company), 1960. For a rebuttal of this see Louw, Semantics of New Testament Greek, 5-16 and James Barr, Semantics of Biblical Language (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1961), 8-20., 262625=11:49, 235568=4:19, 223989=Second, the question of why mass nouns or why plural count nouns are put into the Colwell construction has not been completely answered. If semantic equivalence is the same, despite syntactic occurrence, then why the syntactic variation at all? This is an ancillary issue to our main emphasis throughout this study but it is a necessary corollary of investigation for this subject to be complete. Our guess is that in the wider context, discourse reasons are partly to account for this phenomenon (cf. John 1:1, 14; 3:6 etc.). Thus in the space of a phrase or clause, simple variation might be the sole cause of this phenomenon. But in the larger context, semantic variation, especially involving a singular count noun with a lexically or grammatically qualitative noun (mass or plural count), might be due to semantic determinacy being at stake. In other words, the clear semantic of the mass or plural count noun, is meant to disambiguate the semantics of the singular count noun to which it is related in the discourse. We believe the best example of this occurs in John 1:1 with John 1:14. Therefore we add, tentatively, a final argument for the purely qualitative aspect to the PN in the phrase kaiV qeoV\" h oJ lovgo\". Thus, Jesus is God in every sense that the Father is., 30258=Fourth, Colwell seems to have misunderstood what a definite semantic to the noun entailed linguistically.33 His improper method of prescription, based on his analysis, led him to commit a category mistake by foisting a semantic upon a certain group of nouns (pre-copulative PNs) that he failed to appreciate on their own terms. Because of this, and apparently without considering the ramifications of what the semantic suggested, he applied it to John 1:1c and argued against the indefinite or qualitative sense. But this was an improper use of his own rule, for his rule was only to be applied post hoc to nouns clearly understood to be definite from context. But here is where the problem of his method shows up starkly. Because John 20:28 has the articular qeov\", he assumes that its pre-copulative anarthrous occurrence bears the same semantic. But this is simply an example of pigeonholing a noun into a semantic box based completely on the semantics born out in a separate construction. Count nouns can bear different nuances without the article than it can with the article\u2014Colwell has not properly understood this principle.34 In short he begged the question by making his rule prescriptive rather than descriptive of the majority of cases involving definite nouns preceding the copulative verb., 227572=1:1, 236904=5:9, 302361=78 For a[rto\": Matt 4:3b; Lu 4:3; John 6:35, 41, 48, 50, 51a, 58. For savrx: Matt 19:6; John 1:14; 3:6a; 6:51b., 242171=8:31, 216715=The only example in John where the connection appears to be discourse significant is in 1:14. Here the verse sums up the first 13 verses. When it is compared with 1:1c, it seems to be deliberately positioned to reinforce a qualitative semantic to the latter. In 1:1c the order is CC - PN - V - T - S, kaiV qeoV\" h oJ lovgo\", in contrast to the order in 1:14 which is CC - T - S - PN - V, kaiV oJ lovgo\" saVrx ejgevneto. Whereas the article and subject in 1:1c follow the verb, they precede the verb in 1:14 thus forming a chiasm connecting the two thematically. Upon further examination, it appears that the pre-copulative semantic nuance is meant to be equated (thus Q = Q-d). This is confirmed by the fact that saVrx, being a mass noun, is qualitative (Q-d) irrespective of syntax. Its pre-copulative occurrence, therefore, is unaccounted for if not meant to be syntactically and semantically connected to 1:1., 234234=3:29, 232276=3:4, 84976=For example, A dog is an animal indicates that while the dog is an animal it does not cease to be a dog, only that all animals are not dogs. However, The stones became bread indicates a subset proposition where the constitutionality of one is subsumed by the other. When stones become bread they are no longer stones. However, The Word became flesh shows that although the same grammatical construction occurs (as in the latter) a totally different interpretation results. The Word has flesh added to it while remaining in identity the Word also. In one type a constitutional transference occurs, in the latter an addition takes place. These observations affect more the level of interpretation than grammar, for both are in the possible semantic range of the verb. However, a failure to distinguish between the two has given at least one cult a reason to deny the hypostatic union of Christ (World-wide Church of God).94, 234886=4:18, 36408=Looking at these eight passages47 individually Harner reasoned that although the nouns could be either indefinite or definite, they could also simultaneously have a qualitative force due to the construction.48 His conclusions, based on Mark\u2019s Gospel, showed a preponderance of the construction away from that affirmed by Colwell and almost unanimously qualitative in force as the primary meaning. Evidently he included the possibility of quality independent of either the definite or indefinite nuances too, as his treatment of John 1:1 seems to indicate. In other words, he appears to include, open up or establish the proposition for distinct semantic alternatives to encompass both Q or I-Q and D-Q as viable qualitative semantic domains., 238214=5:27, 258601=10:12, 23036=Conclusions. All this he concludes has implications for grammar, the text and translation or interpretation. In relation to grammar, predicate nominatives with the verb should not be regarded as regularly omitting the article, for two-thirds of definite predicate nouns have it. In regards to the article he gives two broad rules the second of which amounts to exceptions to his first:, 64408=Likewise, there are Greek terms that appear in a grammatically plural form but are deemed as semantically mass. For example, we have divided plural mass nouns into class B and C according to their semantic relations in regards to their grammatical (but not semantic) plurality. Class B nouns are nouns that appear in the grammatical plural but remain semantically singular. The Greek nouns a[rto\" and savrx are examples of this class of noun. According to our study a[rto\" appears in 8 verses, 2 anarthrous and 6 articular PN constructions, whereas savrx occurs in 4 verses, 3 anarthrous and 1 articular PN construction.78 An illustration occurs in Matthew 4:3 where the Devil states, Eij uiJoV\" ei tou' qeou', eijpeV i{na oiJ livqoi ou|toi a[rtoi gevnwntai. \u201cIf you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.\u201d The plural form is used but the sense is not \u201cbreads\u201d or even the more acceptable \u201cloaves\u201d but simply \u201cbread.\u201d79 In all we have identified 25 nouns of this mass type., 313194=105 Pre-copulative anarthrous count are as follows: 1:1, 21a, 39, 49b; 3:6b, 29; 4:19; 5:10, 27; 6:63b; 8:31, 33, 34, 37, 39a, 39b, 42, 44b, 44c, 48, 54c; 9:5, 8, 17, 24, 25, 28a; 10:1a, 2, 8a, 33, 34, 36, 49, 51; 12:6; 13:35; 18:37a, 37b; 19:21, 31, 40. The pre-copulative mass are as follows: 3:4, 6a; 4:34; 6:63c; 10:22; 12:50; 17:17; 18:18., 263931=12:6, 272461=19:40, 62214=A few examples illustrate the category. John 8:44 reads, uJmei'\" ejk tou' patroV\" tou' diabovlou ejsteV . . . ejkei'no\" ajnqrwpoktovno\" h ajp j ajrch'\". \u201cYou are of your father the devil . . . he was a murderer from the beginning.\u201d Hebrews 8:6 reads, nuniV deV diaforwtevra\" tevtucen leitourgiva\", o{sw/ kaiV kreivttonov\" ejstin diaqhvkh\" mesivth\", h{ti\" ejpiV kreivttosin ejpaggelivai\". \u201cBut now having obtained a more valuable ministry, and to the degree which he is a mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted upon better promises.\u201d It is clear that these terms are count and could easily be both grammatically and semantically pluralized. For example, it is not hard to imagine \u201cmurderers\u201d or \u201cmediators.\u201d, 229589=1:39, 250692=9:8, 306474=90 See Lane C. McGaughy, Toward a Descriptive Analysis of Ei ai as a Linking Verb in New Testament Greek (Missoula: Society of Biblical Literature, 1972), 54. He misses quite a few but also mistakenly adds James 4:4 under a 1:3/2e type reading. However, this is a Colwell construct not an articular construction. The pre-copulative articular occurrences are as follows: Count\u2014Matt 10:2; John 1:21; 10:21; 15:1b; 21:7a, 7b, 12; Acts 12:15; 1 Cor 9:1c, 2, 3; 11:3, 25; 2 Cor 3:2, 17; Eph 5:32; 2 Pet 1:17; 2 John 1:6b; Rev 19:8; Mass\u2014John 6:51b; 2 Cor 1:12; Rev 20:14., 286826=43 One author commits the disjunctive fallacy of definiteness or indefiniteness to John 1:1c then ends by affirming the qualitative aspect. See J. Gwyn Griffiths, \u201cA Note on the Anarthrous Predicate in Hellenistic Greek,\u201d ExpTim 62 (1950-51): 314-16. Others, however, have insisted upon either Colwell\u2019s original or rather assumed thesis\u2014anarthrous pre-copulative PNs are usually definite. Those who argue for the definiteness of pre-copulative PNs as Colwell include the following: William Barclay, \u201cAn Ancient Heresy in Modern Dress,\u201d ExpTim 65 (October 1957): 31-2, who states about the NWT of John 1:1 that it is \u201ca translation which is grammatically impossible\u201d (32); Edwin Blum, \u201cStudies in Problem Areas of the Greek Article,\u201d (Th.M thesis, Dallas Theological Seminary, 1961); Kuehne, \u201cThe Greek Article and the Doctrine of Christ's Deity,\u201d 8-22; Robert G.

Metzger states concerning the New World Translation (NWT) of John 1:1 that \u201cIt overlooks entirely an established rule of Greek grammar which necessitates the rendering, \u2018and the Word was God\u2019\u201d (75). He then supports his statement by referring to Colwell\u2019s rule. We would state rather that definite PNs can precede the copulative verb and be anarthrous, but not affirm simply that all pre-copulative anarthrous PNs are definite or even usually definite. We would agree with Metzger\u2019s translation, but the evidence he marshals forth in support of the understanding of that translation is based upon the converse of Colwell\u2019s rule, not the rule itself., 271801=19:38, 273227=3 Of the most important include, Philip Harner, \u201cQualitative Anarthrous Predicate Nouns: Mark 15:39 and John 1:1,\u201d JBL 92 (1973): 75-87; C.

Debrunner by Robert W. Funk (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press; Cambridge: At the University Press, 1961), 273., 259930=10:33, 290714=48 For example he notes that three distinct semantic categories without blend are possible. \u201cIn the next example the predicate noun could be interpreted as definite, indefinite or qualitative, depending on the particular meaning or emphasis which we understand the passage to have (Harner, 79). He also suggests a blending of categories. \u201cIn each case we shall ask not only whether the predicate noun is definite or indefinite, but also whether it has a qualitative force in indicating the nature or character of the subject.\u201d Or regarding John 2:28 he notes that \u201cThe predicate noun has a distinct qualitative force, which is more prominent in this case than its definiteness or indefiniteness.\u201d Or, \u201cBut I would judge that in 40 of these cases [in John] the qualitative force of the predicate is more prominent that its defininteness or indefiniteness\u201d (Harner, 77 [bis], 83 emphasis mine). Concerning qualitativeness and definiteness he states, \u201cThe categories of qualitativeness and definiteness, that is, are not mutually exclusive, and frequently it is a delicate exegetical issue for the intepreter to decide which emphasis a Greek writer had in mind\u201d (Harner, 87). Thus a blending of Q with both I and D are foundational for our designations of semantic categories below., 281015=26 Daniel B.

First, the latter has the possibility of convertibility whereas the former does not.93 Therefore, even relative clauses in the former do not render the phrase definite, nor do genitive adjuncts even though the PN in fact is definite. The nature of the verb militates against it. Second, if a subset proposition occurs the latter connects the subject constitutionally to the PN in such a way that they are indivisible whereas the former may or may not.
