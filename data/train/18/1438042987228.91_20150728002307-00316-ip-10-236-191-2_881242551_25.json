(Think $4,000 compared to $10,000.) Tuition varies on which and how many classes you take, but the classes are set up to help you do your best and to teach you accurate information in whichever field its in. As an update, I'd like to share that this past Spring I was able to enroll in a study abroad class in Japan over spring break! The cost was only about $2700 or so, and we were able to make scheduled payments instead of paying all at one time. We went around the cultural capital, Kyoto, learning about the history and culture of the country while being guided by a professor who grew up there. It was fascinating! For the price paid, we visited many important cultural places in Japan and had a very unique and amazing experience!, 153790=I have enjoyed going to College of Dupage so far. I am looking forward to returning to College of Dupage on August 20th. I am very lucky to have the opportunity to attend this school., 110359=If students don't like to smoke then they should be happy about the no smoking on campus ban which goes into affect August 2012. There are a range of sports activities such as football and basketball for students to be apart of as well., 129050=There are tons of clubs to join that a lot of people miss out on in a community college but you should take advantage of them, especially your first year. There is also a Leadership retreat to Lake Geneva every August, it's a lot of fun., 50921=The food at the school has really improved drastically. When i first attended it in 2008 it was alright but every since they have renovated the quality has risen drastically., 294704=As I am writing this, the cost is $136 per credit hour. Along with some fees for classes, that sums up to ~$1500 for a 12 credit hour student. Pretty cheap. However, this might not guarantee quality professors., 424177=College of DuPage have a variate of food choices. In the Fall semester of 2014 they recently added a Chik-fa-la in the cafeteria., 436969=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot There are some really good teachers, but then there are those who really aren't the best. I've had classes in which I felt challenged, engaged, and really enjoyed it, but I've also been in one or two where the teacher teaches straight from the book, could really care less, and makes it very unenjoyable. But for the money, it's not bad.
