Participants initially underwent two single dose visits (SDV): 30 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) fosamprenavir (FPV) oral suspension, 30/6 mg/kg FPV/ritonavir (RTV) oral solution, followed by individualized dosing (30/7 mg/kg BID to 60/10 mg/kg FPV/RTV twice a day [BID]). Per preliminary data at Week 2, the chronic dosing regimen for Cohort 1 was 45/7 mg/kg FPV/RTV BID, then changed to 45/7 mg/kg FPV/RTV BID with an increase to 60/7 mg/kg FPV/RTV BID at Week 2; later, per another analysis, all additional participants enrolled remained on 45/7 mg/kg FPV/RTV BID throughout. Per data for Cohort 1, participants in Cohort 2 underwent one SDV (45/7 mg/kg FPV/RTV), followed by individualized dosing (30/7 mg/kg to 60/10 mg/kg FPV/RTV BID). Additional enrolled participants in Cohort 2 later received 45/10 mg/kg FPV/RTV BID. FPV/RTV BID Description \u00a0 Reporting Groups Per protocol, the initial intention was to enroll par. to receive fosamprenavir; however, ultimately, no par. were enrolled into cohorts to receive repeat dosing of fosamprenavir without ritonavir boosting. The 59 par. who received >=1 IP dose were included in the Safety Population.",
