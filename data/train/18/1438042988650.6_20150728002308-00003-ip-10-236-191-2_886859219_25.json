The minimum fixed memory allocated is approximately 1500 KB. Additionally, approximately 40 KB of memory is allocated per connection. Thus, you can compute an estimated minimum memory setting needed when enabling PL/SQL for PLSQL_MEMORY_SIZE as 1500 KB plus (number_of_connections * 40). If the application uses PL/SQL, we recommend that you allocate twice the estimated minimum required memory for this segment.

    "textBeforeTable": "Set ReplicationParallelism as follows: Setting Only the instance administrator can change the value of this attribute. Required privilege To learn more about parallel replication, see \"Configuring parallel replication\" in the Oracle TimesTen In-Memory Database Replication Guide. If the CacheAWTParallelism attribute is set to 1 or not set, the maximum allowable value for ReplicationParallelism is 16. To configure parallel replication, set this attribute to a value from 2 to 32, indicating the number of transmitter/receiver pairs. The default value for this attribute is 1. This value indicates that single-threaded replication occurs. If the value is greater than 1, the LogBufParallelism first connection attribute must be an integral multiple of ReplicationParallelism. This attribute specifies the number of tracks, or the number of transmitter/receiver pairs, used for parallel replication. ReplicationParallelism Active standby pairs cannot use user-defined parallel replication. All data stores in the replication scheme must use the same setting. XLA is not supported. This is only supported for TimesTen Release 11.2.2.8 and following for both the active and standby masters. Both the active and standby masters must have commit dependencies disabled. The replication scheme cannot contain cache groups. The replication scheme must be an active standby pair that uses asynchronous replication. Classic",
    "textAfterTable": "Restrictions Restrictions and things to consider when specifying parallel replication include: When parallel replication is enabled, the Description column of the ttLogHolds built-in procedure displays one row per track per subscriber node. We recommend setting the value of this attribute to a value no greater than half the value of the LogBufParallelism attribute. If you specify more replication tracks than log buffer threads, some replication tracks can remain empty. Synchronous replication, including TWOSAFE and RETURN RECEIPT replication, is not supported with user-defined parallel replication. Active standby pairs are not supported with user-defined parallel replication. Parallel replication with disabled commit dependencies is not supported with user-defined parallel replication. Temporary Set this attribute to create a temporary database. Temporary databases are not saved to the file system. They may, however, be shared and therefore require a data store path name. A temporary database is deleted when the last connection is closed. See \"Database persistence\" in Oracle TimesTen In-Memory Database Operations Guide for more information. You cannot assign the Temporary data store attribute to an existing permanent database. Note: You cannot back up or replicate a temporary database. Required privilege Only",
