They originally made the K-9 D-Zine frame and forks for themselves. Then their friends wanted them too, so they made 25 framesets. From these beginnings, more than two decades ago, their goal has not changed \u2013 to make good bikes and run things their way. S&M will continue to sail the seas of BMX until other companies make bikes as good as theirs or it\u2019s not fun anymore. Neither of which they feel looks likely to happen soon.}",
