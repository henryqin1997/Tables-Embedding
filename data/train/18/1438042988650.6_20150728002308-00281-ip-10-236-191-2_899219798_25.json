The classes are great and like I said before, the campus has such a great atmosphere. The people here are so friendly and you really make great friends while you are here. The teachers care about you and there is a lot that you can do down here on campus that don't cost much. There is also Western Swing every Wednesday night for 2 or 3 $. This is part of the culture down here and it's wonderful!, 355507=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 186701=Snow College is great for students who do not know what they want to go into yet. It allows a diverse lineup of classes to take giving students the experience they need in order to settle into a major. It is also wonderful for music students as Snow is well known for its music program. A new four-year degree was just set into place starting Fall of 2012., 313138=I forgot what the exact date of this is, but some time in November is an event called Badger Night. At midnight on Badger Night, a conglomerate of people just start making out with each other, which makes them True Badgers. That's literally it. To quote a friend who was there but did not partake in the, er, activity; Standing in a sea of people sucking faces is really gross and really surreal., 148538=It's great for all kinds of students, but beginning in the 2012-13 year Snow College's music program will start its 4-year program, the first 4-year program at Snow. Being the only community college affiliated with the Juilliard School of Music west of the Mississippi allows music majors to learn from some of the best musicians in the world today, with workshops and concerts promoted by members occurring quite often at Snow., 306054=Just like any college, it depends on the classes you take. Most professors take it easy on the general 1000 level classes. They give most freshman a semester to get used to college life. After that, be prepared to buckle down and focus on school because it's college and college is challenging., 32813=Well I am learning a lot every time I go to class. There is so much that I need to still learn. But one thing that will help me is my Communications 2110 class that will help me to better communicate with family, friends, co-workers, and other acquaintances., 327710=True Badger night. As well as a day in February that always gets treated as a Monday no matter what day of the week it is., 175742=Since Ephraim is such a small town, there isn't really much to do, so the real fun is coming up with your OWN fun! The school constantly has activities going on to keep the students entertained and there are plenty of things you can do- hike up to the S on the mountain, or go for a Denny's run at 2:00 in the morning!, 171717=Get involved in as much as you can but don't overwhelm yourself! Get out there and have fun. Classes and grades are really important so don't ignore them, but make sure you have fun, too. Don't take a class earlier than 8:30 am. I took a 7:30 am class and it was so hard for me to be on time., 316088=You'd think that for a 2-year college, Snow wouldn't have much to brag about where their academics are concerned. I can tell you straight-up that this is a complete and utter lie. For example, there is a Psychology 1010 class taught by a certain professor (whose identity I will leave you to figure out yourself) that, while engaging and interesting, is nothing short of demanding where work and quality are concerned. Most of the professors here care about teaching. By that I mean they aren't professors just for their own benefit, they want to educate students and help them learn as opposed to simply writing dissertations and leaving students with packets of dull, mind-numbing work.}",

Snow College offers lots of financial assistance but there are important deadlines to pay attention to. I would also like students to know that they should apply for classes as soon as they can. Classes fill up quickly and you want to be able to take the classes that will help with your major or help you choose a major. Lastly, I would tell students to get involved. Snow has many activities, clubs, and organizations. I'm sure there is something for everyone to enjoy if you put the effort into finding it. Bang for the buck Snow College is a great place to begin furthering your education. It",
