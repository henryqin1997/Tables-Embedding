For every speed-up, the player is awarded an additional 1000 points on top of the 300. Once maximum speed is achieved, the points become 450 for each Boost Energy, and once collecting three Boost Energy does not result in a speed-up, the point bonus become 1500. If the speed falls by cloud or Delay Energy even a little, the bonus points return to default., 119148=Frozen Treat Sweep is a mini-game which made its debut June 22, 2012 and was initially exclusive to the Icy Cave area of the Island of Dreams, but was later used in other areas after the October 2012 update. Players play as Mime Jr., Scraggy, Pichu, or Oshawott, and move around ice tiles to collect dessert items. There are four types, each with different point distributions. The player competes against two other Pok\u00e9mon consisting of any of the following: Minccino, Riolu, Panpour, Smoochum, Spheal, Kirlia, Marill, Mudkip, Swinub, Buneary, Snorunt, Shinx. The ice tiles are designed such that it can hold the weight of a Pok\u00e9mon up to three times before breaking. If a Pok\u00e9mon falls in, time is lost., 79165=Pok\u00e9mon Bistro (Japanese: \u30c9\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u306f\u3053\u3073 Drink Carrying) is a mini-game originally available in the Pok\u00e9mon Caf\u00e9 Forest, but later became used in the Island of Dreams as of the October 2012 update. Players must ring a bell to guide a Foongus to serve drinks to various Pok\u00e9mon. They receive more points if they serve the correctly-colored drinks, or the drinks are in a Special Cup. If the player tries to move the Foongus too fast, however, it will sweat and may spill or drop drinks. The Foongus can carry up to three drinks at once; however, more drinks increase the chance of dropping them., 107482=Collect Gems (Japanese: \u5b9d\u77f3\u3042\u3064\u3081 Collect Gems) is a mini-game which made its debut November 16, 2011 and was initially exclusive to the Rugged Mountain area of the Island of Dreams, but was later used in other areas after the October 2012 update. Players guide a cart-riding Sableye as it rides down the mountain and collects gems for it to eat, so the amount of gems gained are tallied at the end and correspond to a certain number of points depending on the shape. However, hitting plants will make the cart sway, possibly causing gems to fall out. This affects only the time and the gem bonus at the end of the game, not the current score. By drawing lines to go to a certain rail, Sableye may evade plants and reach gems on higher rails. Some rails might lead to a cave entrance referred to officially as \"hidden areas.\" These contain a higher number of gems than normal areas and lack plants., 98719=Blow Out Candles (Japanese: \u308d\u3046\u305d\u304f\u6d88\u3057 Candle Erasing) is a mini-game which made its debut September 28, 2011 and was initially exclusive to the Spooky Manor area of the Island of Dreams, but was later used in other areas after the October 2012 update. Players alternate turns with the Pok\u00e9mon being befriended choosing which candle or candles on a large candelabra to blow out. Players may blow out as many adjacent candles within a row as they want to (candles with extinguished candles between them cannot be extinguished together), and the goal is to force the opponent to blow out the last candle on the set.}",
