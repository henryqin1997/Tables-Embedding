    "textBeforeTable": "Award Stipends The award may not be used for institutional overhead or indirect costs. Funding Foreign candidates may apply to do their research only in the United States. Candidates applying to work in foreign-based or United States government laboratories may be awarded a fellowship if they are considered to be especially meritorious or if the program represents an unusual opportunity for postdoctoral training. Candidates who are pursuing a degree are not eligible. Candidates who have already accepted a postdoctoral research fellowship award are not eligible. Postdoctoral training in the same institution in which the applicant received his/her degree is discouraged, particularly if it is in the same department.\u00a0 (If either situation applies, the applicant must address the reason(s) in his/her application.)\u00a0 Proposals to continue training in the laboratory where the applicant received his/her PhD will not be considered.\u00a0 Proposals that are direct extensions of graduate work will not be funded. Only one fellowship application will be accepted from a Sponsor, co-Sponsor or Fellow per review session; there is no limit, however, to the number of applications from an institution. No more than two Damon Runyon and/or Damon Runyon-Sohn Fellows will be funded to work with the same Sponsor at any given time. The proposed research must be conducted at a university, hospital or research institution. Level 2 Funding: Physician-scientist applicants (MD, MD/PhD, DDS, DVM or the equivalent) must have completed their residencies and clinical training, must be board eligible in the United States",

Expense Allowance The $2,000 expense allowance is awarded to the laboratory in which the Fellow is working and can be used by the Fellow for his/her educational and scientific expenses.\u00a0 With written request to the Foundation from the Fellow, the expense allowance may be used to defray the cost of health benefits.\u00a0 The Fellow determines how he/she would like to spend the money with approval from his/her sponsor.\u00a0 It is not an allowance for institutional overhead, postdoctoral scholar registration fees or postdoctoral fellowship taxes.\u00a0 Institutions may not automatically deduct any fees from this allowance without the Fellow\u2019s approval.\u00a0 If you have any questions on how the money may be spent, please contact the Foundation (212.455.0520 or .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address)",
