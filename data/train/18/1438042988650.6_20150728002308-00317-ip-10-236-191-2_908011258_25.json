The K-Edge Chain Catcher is a purposeful design that was engineered for a single goal, to help Kristin Armstrong win the Gold at the 2008 Olympic Games. The K-Edge is also perfect for anyone who likes to keep their chain in place, improve shifting performance, and protect their frame from damage caused by a derailed chain. In no time at all K-Edge expanded their range to offer components for road, mountain, and cyclocross. While their focus has been on providing intelligent solutions for the elite level of our sport, the same solutions that the pros ride are available to cyclists of all abilities.}",
