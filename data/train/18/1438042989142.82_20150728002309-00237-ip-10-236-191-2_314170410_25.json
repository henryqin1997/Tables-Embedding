    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{17787=He dropped off a bit in 2009. It wouldn't worry me greatly if he rebounds in 2010, but another dropoff would cause me to wonder about his chances of success in the majors. Still, he hit acceptably for a centerfielder., 13388=The standards for a player to make this section are that first, the player must be less than 30 years old on April 1, 2010, and earn at least 1-oku yen last season (100 million yen). The first standard eliminates those players who are too old to be regarded as hot prospects for the majors in 2010 or after. The second set of requirements are designed to ensure that the players selected are rather high quality talents in Japan. Of course, salaries are hardly perfect measure, but they'll have to do. Many thanks to Michael Westbay for his help in compiling this list., 46148=He definitely had a dropoff in 2009. If he rebounds, I'd continue to be quite interested in a shortstop who hits in the .280 or better range and up with some power by middle infielder standards. If he turned in another season like 2009, though, I'd be far less enthused., 80656=He's won several Gold Gloves at second, and that means even at 2009 levels he could help some teams in the majors. If he can recover some of the power he showed in 2008, he'd be much more impressive., 63345=Through 2008, he had shown steady improvement in both his isolated power and average--and he'd shown decent power for a third sacker. Unfortunately, it looks like injuries slowed him in 2009. So long as he rebounds, I wouldn't worry about it. If he doesn't, then I'd be far less enthusiastic about his chances of success in the majors., 28740=He'll be 30 in August. He's a second baseman and hits OK for that position, but unless he's a glove wizard, he wouldn't be someone I'd think the majors would be overwhelmed with. The fact he hasn't won any Gold Gloves in Japan doesn't suggest he's that kind of fielder. If a team was short on options at second, he might keep the position from being a hole dragging down a team for a couple of years, though., 77622=He's been good the past three years, and four of the past five. The only exception was 2006. If he keeps up this level of performance, he'll get a fair amount of attention., 70505=His 2009 season was not quite as good as his 2008 season, but he held on to the vast majority of his improvement as a hitter. His averages have been good for the past four seasons, and he has shown more power than most middle infielders. He's definitely someone to watch., 67394=He's good enough to fill some role in a major league bullpen, but I'm thinking setup man or middle relief rather than closer. Except for 2009, his strikeouts per IP have been right around a projected one per inning, so he might have the kind of stuff to close., 73628=He improved in terms of plate discipline in 2009. However, otherwise he went backwards with the bat. He's young enough to bounce back, and if he can hit .260 or better while showing the other skills the projection credits him with, he could be interesting., 87570=He's been a solid hitter for a shortstop, and if he can sustain the 2009 improvement in power, it would be a nice plus., 13147=The players in the preceding sections are either free agents, have been posted, or at least have a commitment from the NPB team they play for that they will be posted. The following players aren't going to the majors in 2009., 50119=He had a lost year in 2009, and he'll have to reestablish himself in Japan to garner much interest in the majors. Even before that unproductive season, he didn't look any better than a decent middle relief type, and last season calls even that view into question., 53246=This is a first baseman who hasn't demonstrated 20 HR a year type power for the majors and has middling on base percentage numbers. To top it off, he had a bad year in 2009. If he hit like he did in 2007 or better, he might have some value. Otherwise, forget it., 907=2009 Review \u00a0/ 2008 Review \u00a0/ 2007 Review / 2006 Review / 2005 Review, 57200=This Pacific League pitcher will be 29 next December, and he's at least 2-3 years from getting a shot at the majors, if not more. I don't like his dip in innings pitched in 2008 since I'm not sure why it happened. His drop in performance in 2009 looks like an additional red flag. I'm not too sold on his major league chances right now., 95341=This lefty pitches in the Pacific League and is 29 in February as I write this. He's likely 2-3 years away from a shot at the majors. He had looked mostly like a lefty inning eating type pitcher, which would have real value. However, the fact he had a dramatic drop in innings in 2009 makes it questionable whether he could fill that role. He's got to be more durable than he was in 2009 to have much value to the majors.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Note: I am not doing salary levels this year, as the contracts have already been signed. Central League pitchers are evaluated at National League numbers and Pacific League pitchers at American League numbers, as Japan also has one league with the DH and one without. Doing it this way keeps the players in context. The source for player data are the player pages at Japanese Baseball.com Another Note:I find that the most accurate assessment I can make of pitchers is by looking at their five year averages rather than any individual year. I'd suggest you do the same.
