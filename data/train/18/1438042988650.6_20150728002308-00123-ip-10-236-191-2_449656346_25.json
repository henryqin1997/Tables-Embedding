            "Antineoplastic Hydrogels, and Enzyme-Instructed Preparations Thereof - Disclosed is a general methodology to create nano fibers of therapeutic molecules that have a dual role, as both the delivery vehicle and the drug itself. It is shown that with proper molecular design, the integration of enzymatic reaction and self-assembly provides a powerful method to create molecular hydrogels of clinically-used therapeutics without compromising their bioactivities. In addition, the results disclosed herein demonstrate enzyme-instructed self-assembly as a facile strategy for generating the supramolecular hydrogels of molecules that inherently have poor solubility in water. For example, by covalently connecting paclitaxel with a motif that is prone to self-assemble, a hydrogel of paclitaxel can be formed without compromising the activity of the paclitaxel.",

Specifically, these strands form a plurality of intersections at which one portion of the strand is in proximity to another portion of the same or different strand. More specifically, at least some of those intersections include a plurality of reinforcement members. 06-19-2014 20150073388 DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND RELATED METHODS - The present invention provides systems and methods for the targeted delivery of a therapeutic agent using expandable devices that are temporarily or permanently placed within the body. Such therapeutic agents may be delivered as a coating on the outer surface of the expandable device. Once positioned at a desired location within the body, the device is expanded such that its drug-coated outer surface establishes direct contact with a target tissue. The expanded device remains in contact with the target tissue for a pre-determined amount of time prior to being withdrawn from the body. Delivery of the therapeutic agent using the expandable device may be followed, or preceded, by delivery of a second expandable device to the same location within the body. 03-12-2015 Zhiyun Kuang, Gilbert, AZ US Patent application number Description Published 20120294457 Audio System and Method",
