    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{118052=The following example shows a configuration that allows outside calls to Cisco CME B-ACD to retry an ephone hunt group pilot number every 30 seconds. The example shows the configuration for one ephone hunt group, which is presented by Cisco CME B-ACD menu as the sales department and uses a simple configuration. If a caller selects the sales menu option (ephone-hunt 1) and all of the ephone-dns configured in the list command (1001, 1002, 1003, 1004) are busy, the call will wait 30 seconds and then retry the pilot number (1111) until either an ephone-dn becomes available or a configured amount of time has elapsed (see the call application voice max-time-call-retry command)., 65020=For ephone hunt group 2, three calls can be connected to ephone-dns 2001, 2002, and 2003, and ten calls can be waiting in ephone hunt group 2\u2019s queue. If the status remains unchanged, the fourteenth caller hears the disconnect message and a busy signal. But if one of the earlier calls disconnects (either by leaving the queue or by ending a call), the fourteen call enters the queue., 170519=codec (telephony-service), 149889=The following example associates three menu numbers with three pilot numbers of three ephone hunt groups. Pilot number 1111 is for ephone hunt group 1 (sales); 2222 is for ephone hunt group 2 (customer service); and 3333 is for ephone hunt group 3 (operator). If sales is selected from the AA menu, the call will be transferred to 1111 and sent to ephone hunt group 1\u2019s available ephone-dns (2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006)., 170634=codec (ephone), 201184=no codec}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{309576=The following example uses ephone template 1 to apply the G.729 codec preference to ephone 25:, 309337=The following example selects the G.729 codec with DSP farm assist for calls that are being configured for ephone 25:, 460106=Credentials service for SRST runs on default port 2445. Cisco Unified CallManager connects to port 2445 on the secure SRST router and retrieves the secure SRST device certificate during the TLS handshake., 430936=This command was implemented on the Cisco 1760., 243250=The following example clears the conference number 1111 and drops all its parties:, 316591=The G.722-64K codec is supported on certain phones only, such as the Cisco Unified IP Phone 7906G, 7911G, 7941G-GE, 7942G, 7945G, 7961G-GE, 7962G, 7965G, and 7975G. Check your phone documentation to make sure your phones support the G.722-64K codec., 297834=To select a preferred codec for Cisco Unified CME to use when configuring calls for a phone, use the codec command in ephone or ephone-template configuration mode. To return to the command default, use the no form of this command., 305413=When you use the codec command without the dspfarm-assist keyword, you affect only calls between two phones on the Cisco Unified CME router (such as between an IP phone and another IP phone or between an IP phone and a FXS analog phone). The command has no effect on a call directed through a VoIP dial peer unless you use the dspfarm-assist keyword., 307105=It is recommended that the dspfarm-assist keyword be used sparingly and only when absolutely required for bandwidth savings or when you know the phone will have few calls that require a G.711 codec., 304625=The telephone\u2019s firmware version must support the specified codec. If a codec is specified by using this command and a phone does not support the preferred codec, then the phone will use the global codec as specified by using the codec command in telephony-service configuration mode or if the global codec is not supported, G.711 micro-law., 317220=The following example shows how to configure a G.722-64K codec in telephony-service configuration mode:, 304449=The G.722-64K codec is supported on some varieties of phone models. Check your phone documentation to make sure the phone supports the G.722-64K codecs., 429560=This command was introduced on the Cisco 1750, Cisco 1751, Cisco 2600 series, Cisco 3600 series, and Cisco IAD2420 series., 304182=For calls to phones that are not in the same Cisco Unified CME system (such as VoIP calls), the codec is negotiated based on the protocol that is used for the call (such as H.323). The Cisco Unified CME system plays no part in the negotiation., 152253=The following example forwards calls for the ephone-dn 2345 when it does not answer., 312537=To select a default codec for SCCP IP phones in Cisco Unified CME, use the codec command in telephony-service configuration mode. To disable the codec, use the no form of this command., 459262=Credentials service for Cisco Unified CME runs on default port 2444., 138070=The following example establishes night-service hours from 1 p.m. Saturday until 8 a.m. Monday. During that time, calls to extension 1000 (ephone-dn 1) are forwarded to extension 2346. Note that the night-service bell command has also been used for ephone-dn 1., 307379=You should consider your options carefully when deciding to use the dspfarm-assist keyword with the codec command. The benefit is that it allows calls to use the G.729r8 codec on the call leg between the IP phone and the Cisco Unified CME router, which saves network bandwidth. The disadvantage is that for situations requiring G.711 codecs, such as conferencing and Cisco Unity Express, DSP resources that can be scarce will be used to transcode the call, and delay will be introduced while voice is shuttled to and from the DSP. In addition, the overuse of this feature can mask configuration errors in the codec selection mechanisms involving dial peers and codec lists., 301096=G.711 micro-law is the preferred codec., 430510=This command was implemented on the Cisco 2600-XM and Cisco 2691., 119432=The following example uses an ephone-dn template to forward calls for extension 2345 when it is busy., 316864=The telephone firmware version on a Cisco Unified IP phone must support the specified codec. If this command is configured and a phone does not support the specified codec, the default codec for that phone is G.711 micro-law., 305943=When you use the g729r8 keyword to select the G.729r8 codec for the RTP segment between the IP phone and the Cisco Unified CME router and you also use the dspfarm-assist keyword, the router attempts to use DSP-farm resources in the following way: If the IP phone is in a VoIP call (H.323 or SIP) or a Cisco Unified CME conference in which the codec must be set to G.711, the router uses configured DSP-farm resources to attempt to return the segment between the phone and the Cisco Unified CME router to G.729. Adequate DSP resources must be appropriately configured separately., 119020=The following example forwards all calls for the ephone-dn 2345 when it is busy.}",
