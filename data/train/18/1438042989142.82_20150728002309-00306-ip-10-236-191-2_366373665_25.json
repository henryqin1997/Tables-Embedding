Carrier Grade NAT dynamically maps one or more private IP addresses into one or more public (globally routable) IP addresses that use Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) techniques. Traditionally, NAT boxes are deployed in residential home gateways (HGWs) to translate multiple private IP addresses that are configured on multiple devices inside the home to a single public IP address that is configured and provisioned on the HGW by the service provider. Service providers deploy NAT in such a way that multiple subscribers can share a single global IP address. The Carrier Grade NAT scales to several millions of NAT translations, making it a Carrier Grade NAT (CGN). CGN on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router requires an RTU license (FLASR1-CGN-2M (=)) that enables up to 2M translations or (FLASR1-CGN-6M (=)) that enables up to 6M translations depending on the selected ESP. For hardware models that support more than 2M or 6M translations, you can order more than one licenses. For example, with the Cisco ASR 1000 ESP100, you can have up to 12M translations, so you can order 2 x FLASR1-CGN-6M(=) to give you RTU of up to 12M translations. You can configure CGN by using the ipnat settings mode cgn command. Usethe ipnat settings mode default command to change to the default or traditional NAT operating mode. In the default mode, you do not need any license. In CGN mode, you will need one of the following part numbers: FLASR1-CGN-2M (=) or FLASR1-CGN-6M (=)., 259571=Cisco ASR 1013 Accessory Kit, 844377=Broadband 64K Sessions Feature Lic for ASR1000 Series, 820477=Encryption Right-To-Use Feature Lic for ASR1000 Series, spare, 710096=For more details and available bundles, please contact your local Cisco account representative.
