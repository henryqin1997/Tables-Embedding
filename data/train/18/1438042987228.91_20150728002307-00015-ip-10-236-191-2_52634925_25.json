Dow was born in Woodsville, New Hampshire, in 1915. He first came to Alaska in the summer of 1933 as a member of the Harvard-Dartmouth expedition led by Henry Bradford Washburn, Jr., to map the Mount Crillon area. He attended Dartmouth University (1934-1935) where he was also a member of the ski team. He also studied engineering and aerial photography at the Institute of Geographical Exploration at Harvard University (1935-1936). Dow returned to Alaska to stay in 1936, working at a series of jobs in mining, logging, and construction. He married Benzie Ola \"Rusty\" Scott Sellars in December 1939. They lived in Anchorage until after the end of World War II. Russ Dow's early employment included work with aviation pioneer and entrepreneur Bob Reeve at Valdez, at Independence Mine, at a logging camp at Pigot Bay, and as a bulldozer operator at Fort Richardson. He was also a ski instructor for the U.S. Army at Fort Richardson (1940-1945). In 1947, he and his wife settled a homestead north of the Knik River. From 1956 until his retirement in 1987, he worked as an operator for the Bureau of Reclamation at the Eklutna Power Plant. Russ Dow was an avid photographer, recording his and his wife's life, work, and recreation. He was also a president and member of the Anchorage Ski Club and prominent member of the Pioneers of Alaska Igloo No. 31 in Palmer. Three years after the death of his wife, \"Rusty\" Dow, he married Marilyn \"Em\" DeVine of Palmer, Alaska.
