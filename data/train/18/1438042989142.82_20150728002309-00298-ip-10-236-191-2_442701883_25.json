Started in 2004 in Cheddar, Somerset, Split Second Imports decided they needed another BMX brand to add to their bike portfolio. Rather than try to acquire an existing brand, they decided that due to the years of experience they had both accumulated in the study of bike spec, costs, design and import logistics. They would use all of their ideas and expertise to invent their own! Today BLANK products can be found in BMX retailers across the length and breadth of the UK, offering replacement and after-market parts and accessories of all sizes, shapes and colours, all at the same great price you\u2019ve come to expect from BLANK, along with the awesome range of complete bikes which seem to get better year-on-year!}",
