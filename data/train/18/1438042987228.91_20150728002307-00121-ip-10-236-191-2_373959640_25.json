The default MTU configuration of 1500 bytes on the interface is assumed. After configuration, the threshold value is 1300 bytes--that is, for all SIP requests over 1300 bytes, TCP is the transport mechanism., 3319=This feature was introduced to achieve compliance with SIP RFC 2543-bis-04, later published as RFC_3261., 179287=1--Domain-name prefix of format protocol.transport. (RFC 2052 style), 40742=Yes. SIP gateways support midcall Invite requests with the same call-ID but different Session Description Protocols (SDP) session parameters (to change the transport address). Midcall INVITE requests can also change the port number, codec, or refresh the session timer value., 212435=conn-addr --RFC 2543/RFC 3261 method of using the connection address for initiating call-hold requests. Uses 0.0.0.0., 178834=Generates DNS SRV queries with either RFC 2052 or RFC 2782 format. Keywords are as follows:, 119138=RFC 3261, which obsoletes RFC 2543, defines the SIP signaling protocol for creating, modifying and terminating sessions. The SIP Extensions for Caller Identity and Privacy feature provides support for the following SIP gateway implementations that are compliant with the RFC 3261specification:, 17297=RFC 3261, which obsoletes RFC 2543, defines the SIP signaling protocol for creating, modifying, and terminating sessions. Cisco\u2019s implementation of RFC 3261 supports the following:, 89042=RFC 2833, 16229=SIP on Cisco VoIP gateways uses Domain Name System Server (DNS SRV) query to determine the IP address of the user endpoint. The query string has a prefix in the form of \u201cprotocol.transport.\u201das defined by RFC 2052. This prefix is attached to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the next-hop SIP server., 91599=Cisco SIP gateways support T.38 and T.37 fax relay, store, and forward mechanisms. The table below is based on Annex-D of the T.38 ITU recommendation, Procedures for Real-Time Group 3 Facsimile Communication over IP Networks , June 1998. The table indicates recommendations from the standard and if Cisco SIP gateways support the requirements., 15674=The Cisco SIP gateway complies with RFC 2543. However, RFC 3261 has now replaced (obsoleted) RFC 2543. See \"Restrictions for SIP RFC Compliance\" and \"SIP RFC 3261 Compliance\" for more information about what is and is not supported in the new RFCs., 87631=Cisco SIP gateways support DTMF relay in accordance with RFC 2833. The DTMF relay method is based on the transmission of Named Telephony Events (NTE) and DTMF digits over a Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) stream., 135796=The SIP Extensions for Caller Identity and Privacy feature supports loose-routing, a mechanism that helps keep the request target and next route destination separate. The lr parameter, used in the uniform resource indicator (URI) that a proxy places in the Record-Route header, indicates proxy compatibility with RFC 3261. If the lr parameter is missing from a request, the UA assumes the next-hop proxy implements strict-routing in compliance with RFC 2543, and reformats the message to preserve information in the Request-URI., 179581=2--Domain-name prefix of format _protocol._transport. (RFC 2782 style), 173779=No configuration tasks are required to enable RFC 2543. It is enabled by default., 168291=The capability to configure the MTU size on an Ethernet or Fast Ethernet interface already exists on the Cisco SIP gateways. If the MTU is not configured, the default MTU value is 1500 bytes. Assuming an MTU of 1500 bytes, requests larger than 1300 bytes are considered the threshold value for dynamic transport switching., 93155=T.38 over SIP must be implemented as described in ANNEX D of the T.38 ITU recommendation, Procedures for Real-Time Group 3 Facsimile Communication over IP Networks , June 1998., 16560=A second prefix style has been added to Cisco VoIP gateways and is now the default. This second style is defined by RFC 2782, which obsoleted RFC 2052 in February 2000. This new style is in compliance with RFC 2782 and appends the protocol label with an underscore \u201c_\u201d as in \u201c_protocol._transport.\u201d The addition of the underscore reduces the risk of the same name being used for unrelated purposes.}",
