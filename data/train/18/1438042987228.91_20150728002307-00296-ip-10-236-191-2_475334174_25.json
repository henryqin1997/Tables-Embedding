Methodology for sequencing both ends of a cluster are described in co-pending applications WO07010252 and PCTGB2007/003798, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. In one example, the series of steps may be performed as follows; generate clusters, linearise, hybridise first sequencing primer and obtain first sequencing read. The first sequencing primer can be removed, a second primer hybridised and the tag sequenced. The nucleic acid strand may then be \u2018inverted\u2019 on the surface by synthesising a complementary copy from the remaining immobilised primers used in cluster amplification. This process of strand resynthesis regenerates the double stranded cluster. The original template strand can be removed, to linearise the resynthesised strand that can then be annealed to a sequencing primer and sequenced in a third sequencing run., 204787=To a suspension of product 3 (6.12 g, 22.64 mmol) and triethylamine (6.94 ml, 2.2 eq) in THF (120 ml) was added bromoacetyl chloride (2.07 ml, 1.1 eq), through a pressure equalized dropping funnel, over a one hour period and at \u221260\ufffd C. (cardice and isopropanol bath in a Dewar). The reaction mixture was then stirred at room temperature overnight and the completion of the reaction was checked by TLC (dichloromethane:methanol 9:1) the following day. The salts formed during the reaction were filtered off and the reaction mixture evaporated to dryness. The residue was purified by chromatography (neat dichloromethane followed by a gradient of methanol up to 5%). 3.2 g (11.55 mmol, 51%) of the product 1 (BRAPA) were obtained as a white powder. A further recrystallization performed in petroleum ether:ethyl acetate gave 3 g of the product 1. 1H NMR (400 MHz, d6-DMSO) \u03b4 1.21-1.30 (m, 2H, CH2), 1.34-1.48 (m, 4H, 2\ufffdCH2), 3.02-3.12 (m, 4H, 2\ufffdCH2), 3.81 (s, 2H, CH2), 5.56 (d, 1H, J=9.85 Hz, CH), 6.07 (d, 1H, J=16.9 Hz, CH), 6.20 (dd, 1H, J=10.1 Hz and 16.9 Hz, CH), 8.07 (bs, 1H, NH), 8.27 (bs, 1H, NH).

Sequencing of clusters is described in more detail in WO06064199. The contents of the above-listed documents are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties., 36606=The study of complex genomes, in particular, the search for the genetic basis of disease in humans requires genotyping on a massive scale. Screens for numerous genetic markers performed on populations large enough to yield statistically significant data are needed before associations can be made between a given genotype and a particular disease. However large-scale genotyping is demanding in terms of the cost of both materials and labour involved, and the time taken to perform the study, especially if the methodology employed involves separate serial analysis of individual DNA samples. One shortcut is to pool DNA from many individuals and to determine parameters such as the ratio of changes at certain positions in the genome. Such measurements of \u2018allele frequency\u2019 in the pool of samples can be used to correlate the relationship between the changes in the genome sequence and the occurrence of a disease. Hence, an association study involving 1000 patients would in theory only necessitate a \u2018one-pot\u2019 reaction for each genetic change. Pooling therefore represents an effective technique for analysing large quantities of samples in a facile manner., 134324=DNA Primers with a phosphorothioate at the n\u22121 position (5\ufffd85 \u03bcl of each Primer (approx 25 \u03bcM)) were aliquoted into Eppendorf tubes. 10 \u03bcl of 10\ufffd Exonuclease I Reaction Buffer and 5 \u03bcl of Exonuclease I was added to each tube. Each Eppendorf tube was placed in a rack and stored in an oven set at 37\ufffd C. for 16 hours. After 16 hr, the tubes were placed on a hotblock set at 80\ufffd C. for 2 minutes. Subsequently, the solutions from the Eppendorfs were passed through P6 Bio-Rad columns and spun in a centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 2 minutes. An extra 20 \u03bcl of H20 was added to the columns and the columns respun. The filtered solutions were placed into a SpeedVac\ufffd and evaporated until each was at 20 \u03bcl, and the fractions combined. The pooled fractions were injected into a reverse phase HPLC system, and the main peak was collected. The collected fractions were evaporated to dryness in a SpeedVac\ufffd, 50 \u03bcl of water was added and the fraction was subjected again to evaporation to dryness. The resulting pellets were dissolved in 50 \u03bcl of water, pooled and a UV measurement taken to determine the concentration of the oligonucleotide., 38392=Several of the new methods employed for high throughput DNA sequencing (Nature. 437, 376-380 (2005); Science. 309, 5741, 1728-1732 (2005)) rely on a universal amplification reaction, whereby a DNA sample is randomly fragmented, then treated such that the ends of the different fragments all contain the same DNA sequence. Fragments with universal ends can be amplified in a single reaction with a single pair of amplification primers. Separation of the library of fragments to the single molecule level prior to amplification ensures that the amplified molecules form discrete populations that can then be further analysed. Such separations can be performed either in emulsions (Nature. 437, 376-380 (2005); Science. 309, 5741, 1728-1732 (2005)), or on a surface (Nucleic Acids Research 27, e34 (1999); Nucleic Acids Research 15, e87 (2000))., 151428=Four (4) \u03bcl of the libraries were cloned into a plasmid vector (Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit, Invitrogen #K2800-20) and plated out on agar, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Colonies were picked, mini-prepped and the cloned fragments sequenced by conventional Sanger sequencing., 104684=Following the cleavage step, regardless of the method used for cleavage, the product of the cleavage reaction may be subjected to denaturing conditions in order to remove the portion(s) of the cleaved strand(s) that are not attached to the solid support. Suitable denaturing conditions, for example sodium hydroxide solution, formamide solution or heat, will be apparent to the skilled reader with reference to standard molecular biology protocols (Sambrook et al., 2001, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY; Current Protocols, eds Ausubel et al.). Denaturation results in the production of a sequencing template which is partially or substantially single-stranded. A sequencing reaction may then be initiated by hybridisation of a sequencing primer to the single-stranded portion of the template., 273975=Surface amplification was carried out by isothermal amplification using a commercially available Solexa/Illumina cluster station as described in WO08002502. The cluster station is essentially a hotplate and a fluidics system for controlled delivery of reagents to a flow cell., 264044=Sequencing of the clusters from the above illustrative protocol was carried out using modified nucleotides prepared as described in International patent application WO 2004/018493, and labeled with four spectrally distinct fluorophores, as described in U.S. application No. 60/801,270; filed May 18, 2006.

The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC (dichloromethane:methanol 9:1).

Such fragmentation methods are known in the art and utilise standard methods (Sambrook and Russell, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, third edition). For the sake of clarity, generating smaller fragments of a larger piece of nucleic acid via specific PCR amplification of such smaller fragments is not equivalent to fragmenting the larger piece of nucleic acid because the larger piece of nucleic acid sequence remains in intact (i.e., is not fragmented by the PCR amplification). Moreover, random fragmentation is designed to produce fragments irrespective of the sequence identity or position of nucleotides comprising and/or surrounding the break. More particularly, the random fragmentation is by mechanical means such as nebulisation or sonication to produce fragments of about 50 base pairs in length to about 1500 base pairs in length, still more particularly 50-700 base pairs in length, yet more particularly 50-400 base pairs in length. Most particularly, the method is used to generate smaller fragments of from 50-150 base pairs in length., 298517=Incorporated nucleotides were detected using the Illumina genome analyzer, a Total Internal Reflection based fluorescent CCD imaging apparatus described in \u201cSystems and Devices for Sequence by Synthesis Analysis,\u201d U.S. Ser.
