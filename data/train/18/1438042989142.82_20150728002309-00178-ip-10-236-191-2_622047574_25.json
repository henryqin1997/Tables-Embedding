            "Description",
            "These data were collected using the CHARTS system. It is owned by the Naval Oceanographic Office and operated through contract. The system collects topographic lidar data at 9 kHz, bathymetric lidar data at 1 kHz and RGB imagery at 1 Hz. A CASI-1500 hyperspectral line scanner is integrated with the system as well. Aircraft position, velocity and acceleration information are collected through a combination of Novatel and POS A/V 410 equipment. All raw data streams are transferred to the office for downloading and processing in SHOALS GCS software. Aircraft position data are processed using POSPac software and the results are combined with the lidar data to produce 3-D positions for each lidar shot. Upon inspection and QA/QC in the software packages Fledermaus and PFM_ABE, anomalous data are flagged as invalid. PFM_ABE's chartsLAS module then converts all valid data from ellipsoid to orthometric heights based on the NGS' GEOID03 model and exports data as a series of first return topography (TF), last return topography (TL) and bathymetry (H) ASCII files. The bathymetry files contain all of the returns from the bathymetric sensor which include returns both above and below the water.",
            "The NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) received unclassified files in ASCII format. The files contained LiDAR intensity and elevation measurements. CSC performed the following processing on the data for data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes: 1. The data (topographic last return and hydrographic lidar points) were converted from ASCII format to las format. 2. The data were converted from NAVD88 heights to ellipsoid heights using GEOID03. 3. The hydrographic lidar data points were classified according to the ASPRS LAS 1.2 classification scheme as 11 (bathymetry) and the topographic last return lidar data points were classified as 1 (unclassified). 4. The LAS header fields were sorted by latitude and updated.",
            "Times had originally been stored as POSIX seconds when converted to LAS. This was switched to adjusted GPS time (GPS seconds - 1e9) to conform to the LAS 1.2 standard. The data were also converted to LAZ format.",
            "The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) received lidar data files via ftp transfer from the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The data are currently being served via NOAA CSC Digital Coast at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. The data can be used to re-populate the system. The data are archived in LAS or LAZ format. The LAS format is an industry standard for LiDAR data developed by the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS); LAZ is a loseless compressed version of LAS developed by Martin Isenburg (http://www.laszip.org/). The data are exclusively in geographic coordinates (either NAD83 or ITRF94). The data are referenced vertically to the ellipsoid (either GRS80 or ITRF94), allowing for the ability to apply the most up to date geoid model when transforming to orthometric heights."
