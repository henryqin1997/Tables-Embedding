            "MAP-UPDATING-DATA CREATING METHOD, AND MAP UPDATING METHOD AND APPARATUS - A map-updating-data creating apparatus performs, for each old map file, creating a map-updating file for rewriting the map file to a new map file, determining the serial number of each of the updated map files, creating a serial number management file in which marks are respectively written at positions corresponding to the serial numbers, and generating, as map-updating data, the map-updating file and the serial number management file. A navigation apparatus performs map-updating processing and determines, by referring to the serial number management file, whether a map file has already been updated. The navigation apparatus uses the map-updating file to execute navigation control if the map file has already been updated, and updates the map file and subsequently executes the navigation control if the map file has not been updated.",

            "OPTICAL FIBER CONNECTOR - An optical fiber connector comprises a ferrule having a rear end, a chuck located rearward of the ferrule, a ring having a front end, and a coil spring. The ring is attached to the chuck so as to surround the chuck. The optical fiber connector holds an optical fiber which is inserted from a rear end of the optical fiber connector. In detail, when the optical fiber is inserted into the optical fiber connector, an end of the optical fiber passes through the chuck to be accommodated in the ferrule. The coil spring presses the ring forward (toward the ferrule) so that the chuck is squeezed to hold the inserted optical fiber. When the ring is moved rearward by a stopper inserted between the rear end of the ferrule and the front end of the ring, the chuck is released to release the optical fiber.",
            "OPTICAL FIBER CUTTER/COATING MATERIAL REMOVER APPARATUS AND METHOD OF CUTTING OPTICAL FIBER AND REMOVING COATING MATERIAL - An optical fiber cutter/coating material remover apparatus includes an optical fiber cutter unit and a coating material remover unit, the apparatus being configured such that the end portion of the multi-core optical fiber is cut while the optical fiber cutter unit is apart from the coating material remover unit, the cut end portion of the multi-core optical fiber is inserted into the coating material remover unit by sliding the optical fiber cutter unit or the coating material remover unit so that the optical fiber cutter unit and the coating material remover unit are in contact with each other, and then the coating material is removed by sliding the optical fiber cutter unit or the coating material remover unit so that the optical fiber cutter unit is apart from the coating material remover unit.",
            "ORGANIC EL ELEMENT AND TRANSLUCENT SUBSTRATE - A translucent substrate may include a transparent support substrate, and a light extracting layer formed on the transparent support substrate, including a glass material having a first refractive index in a range of 1.6 to 2.2 for D line, and a scattering material having a second refractive index different from the first refractive index for the D line. The light extracting layer may have a surface formed with a plurality of projections including at least one of an approximately pyramid-shaped projection having one peak point and an approximately triangular prism-shaped projection having one peak edge. An inclination angle formed by an edge and a base edge of an approximate triangle, obtained in a vertical cross section passing through the peak point or the peak edge of the projection, may be in a range of 10\u00b0 to 60\u00b0."

A convex portion is formed in one of the second hinge piece and the hinge block facing to the second hinge piece. A concave portion is formed in the other of the second hinge piece and the hinge block facing to the second hinge piece. A friction member is provided in the concave portion to brake the rotational speed of the lid due to the torsion spring by holding the friction member under pressure between the concave portion and the convex portion. A protrusion is provided on one of an outer circumference of the convex portion and an inner circumference of the concave portion for braking the rotational speed of the lid by sliding contact with the other one of the outer circumference of the convex portion and the inner circumference of the concave portion. A recessed circumferential portion is formed between the outer circumference of the convex portion and the inner circumference of the concave portion so as to release the sliding contact of the braking protrusion at least at the closed position of the lid. 20090165813 Published",

The computer selects a selling space image data obtained when the person corresponding to the trajectory data is positioned in the image monitoring area. The computer analyzes the selling space image data to extract a person image. The computer checks the person image extracted from the selling space image data against image data on each customer to search for customer image data obtained by taking an image of the person in the person image. The computer stores, upon detecting the customer image data obtained by taking an image of the person in the person image, identification information on transaction data stored in association with the customer image data, in association with identification information on the trajectory data. 08-18-2011 20140138426 WIRE BONDING APPARATUS AND BONDING METHOD - Provided is a wire bonding apparatus capable of performing high-speed wedge wire bonding, the apparatus including: a bonding tool having a",
