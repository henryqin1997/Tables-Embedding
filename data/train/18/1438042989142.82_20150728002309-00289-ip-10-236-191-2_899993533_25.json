I started this process late in July, so had to wait until after the semester started to get any financial aid. Then go online to the Leeward website and figure out what major and classes you want to take. I'll say it again..start early!, 213401=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 206390=The food is good, but expensive, plus they only except cash. Except for Subway, (They have a Subway there obviously) But our school throws many events, and at these events there is always great food. For our Halooween party this past wednesday on 10/29/2014 We had cupcake trucks and local food trucks. I ate Pastele Stew with Gandule Rice, along with Red Velvet Malasada Cheesecake Bites. and it was only 15.00 dollars for the both of tjem. it was very delicious., 112250=Student ID is free and qualifies you for student discounts at the movie theaters and on the bus. Parking on campus is always hard to find, but if you're lucky you'll find street parking. Price per unit here is $101 for Hawaii residents (2012 price). $1212 for 12 units. I bought my books at amazon.com for around $200 total.}",
