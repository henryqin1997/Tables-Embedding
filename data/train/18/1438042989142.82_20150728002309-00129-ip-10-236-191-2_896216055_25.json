            "UT is pretty expensive for a in-state school, and if you are out of state, it's really hard to get any kind of funding. In-state students can get things like the HOPE scholarship and other Tennessee scholarships to offset the costs.",
            "I didn't enjoy being here. For those people who love to party, Greek life or athletes, then this is the school for you. UT is very into their sports programs, especially football, yet they take away from their cultural programs like art and dance, which sucks big time. The strip is nothing but bars and clubs so if you're not into that then it's going to be hard to find something to do. If you bring a car, parking is a nightmare and if you don't have a car, you're looking at a 45 minute to a 1 hour bus ride to get to Walmart for basic necessities. The same thing goes for the mall and anywhere else you would like to go for fun. Another reason I didn't like UT was because being in East Tennessee, I and the few friends that I made their experienced racism which was something I thought a university like UT wouldn't have.",
            "As far as the academics went, UT was great! I learned a lot from my teachers and most of them were very educated in their subjects and were always open during office hours for help. A lot of the information I learned at UT was useful for when I came back home to my other school. You just have to connect with your professors and show them that you are interested in their class. A lot of professors give some sort of incentive for showing up to class like if you are there 85% of the time, they'll drop your lowest test grade and replace it with your highest or give you 10 extra credit points on your final, so it's good to go to class all the time other than because you need to be in class anyways. Also a lot of professors base all their tests off their lectures and they don't have them up on their websites for people to look at if they don't come to class so if you're looking to pass, you need to attend everyday."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{672297=The seal on Pedestrian Parkway is said to be cursed, and anyone who steps on it is said to take longer than 4 years to graduate. The Hill on campus is historic, and has been around since 1794. It is where a lot of science and math classrooms are located. There is the pass the torch ceremony for incoming freshmen. You sit with your entire freshman class in an auditorium and listen to a presentation by your administration. Once this presentation is over, everyone lights an individual candle. It's a really neat experience., 882229=University of Tennessee is a public institution that was founded in 1794. It has a total undergraduate enrollment of 21,214, its setting is urban, and the campus size is 560 acres. USNEWS Report ranks University of Tennessee no. 101 best university in the nation. The school is located in Knoxville, one of the state\u00e2??s largest cities, and is the flagship campus for the state school. Close to 40 percent of students join a fraternity or sorority. The UT sports teams are known as the Vols and the Lady Vols, short for Volunteers. The teams compete in the NCAA Division I Southeastern Conference, and football season is a particularly big draw at the school., 212488=Apply before November 1! Definitly increases your chances of scholarships., 693145=They serve breakfast till 2:30 on weekends!, 744585=the whole campus is a tradition--Big Orange Country, Rocky Top. UT is one of the oldest colleges in the country, founded in 1794. everybody knows Rocky Top, and you'll sing it a lot in the fall., 842803=The University of Tennessee has a special alert system set up for cell phones that alerts students when something is happening on campus. I have never felt unsafe on campus, and often times, I am walking alone back to my dorm well after 10:30 p.m. All walkways are always well lit, and campus blue lights are set up everywhere., 988643=I don't like it at all. My friend loves the pizza though, so some people are cool with it. It's expensive, with crappy dining times (like 7-8:30 weekdays/Sunday and 8-2 on Saturday...) and the food is barely ample. I am a bit pickier though., 490300=Since 2007, campus safety has improved greatly! There is a text/email system so that anytime the UTPD are called, all students, faculty, staff, and even parents are notified. Another great thing I love about UTPD is that they are REAL police men and women. I feel protected knowing they could protect me., 663160=I love my roommate and my living situation. The bathrooms stay clean. I just wish we could have heat before the middle of November. It's getting cold in here., 66289=Come for a visit and just have fun. Come with your friends to the campus doesn't feel so large when you first come. When school starts, don't stay in your room, go out and meet everybody cause the fist week is where everybody is new and looking for new friends. Also if your a freshman, get a meal plan (10 meals, not unlimited because you don't get very many dining dollars) and stay in a dorm. Carrick is a great dorm because you share two rooms with 3 other people and this building is in the middle of presidential court which is where everybody hangs out and is where some of the food is. Apply early, either November 1 (for scholarship opportunities) or December 1 (application deadline). Also bring winter clothes after fall break, but keep some summer ones because the weather is really weird here. Also do bring an umbrella and or rain coat because it rains a lot. Bring some good tennis shoes because you walk everywhere everyday and flip flops will hurt you feet after a while., 1038313=1982 World Fair Park, Market Square and Krutch Park, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, West Town Mall, Holy Land Market on Sutherland Ave., McClung Museum (my favorite place on campus; I've attended free lectures for the public from really intersting people like photojournalist Chris Rainier and egyptologist Salima Ikram), the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra, country stars in concert on campus, the Dogwood Arts Festival in the Spring, tailgate parties during football season, SEC games, clubbing on the Strip... Cute little towns like Downtown Dandridge are in close driving distance. Visit the TVA dams if you want to go to the lake. Go fishing. Drive to Pigeon Forge or Gatlinburg if you want to do something touristy. Go to Dollywood or Ripley's Aquarium, or go skiing ir ride the sky lift or the really big ferris wheel in Pigeon Forge. And Atlanta, Nashville, and Chattanooga are all a few hours away., 50184=The people on campus and off are amazing, I have never in my life met such kind people! Everyone at U.T. is very helpful, I am going on my official guided 'tour' in April, however, my first visit to U.T. I went on a self-guided tour with my family. My first visit was a bit overwhelming, but a few students took the time out of their busy schedules to show me some of their favorite spots! Go Vols!, 1089527=I lived in Clement my freshman year, it's being remodeled so it won't be open until fall 2015 but I highly recommend it. However, if you're a freshman I would definitely say living in Pres Court will help you meet people and it's a lot closer to the dining hall. UT is in the process of upgrading the on-campus housing in the next few years and from what they've shown us it's gonna be awesome., 864240=There are only a couple of dorms that are really nice, but they are for upperclassman and they fill up ridiculously quick. They just raised their prices this year (2013-2014), so it is now even more expensive to live on campus (about $700 a month). While living on campus is a lot easier and allows you to walk to classes, living off campus is cheaper and has more amenities. Also, commuter parking passes cost less than non-commuter ones, and you can always take the campus busses from your parking area to your classes., 897048=I've had great professors at UT but I've also had a lot of TAs, and I hate that I'm paying so much for tuition and not getting actual professors. There's a lot of construction going on which makes it more difficult to get around campus. Also, they raised tuition 6% again this year, which means they've raised it 26% since I started at UT in 2010., 1066507=Live in presidential courtyard or in the new dorm being built now (today is April 10, 2014, I'm not sure when it will be ready.) Come into school as undecided unless you're really sure what you want to study. I didn't declare a major until Junior year, and I'm still graduating on time. Get involved with extracurricular activities early. You will make great connections and a lot of new friends., 164294=I had a 3.7 GPA, a 23 on my ACT, and a 1480 SAT score and I got in just fine, but there are some requirements., 69059=I am learning so much at The University of Tennessee so far. I just started in the Fall of 2010 and feel like I have learned more than I ever did in high school. My hardest class for the fall semester was Geology (planetary bodies) because the concepts are just difficult to wrap your head around but I learned so much about other planets. I also took a math class that went over everything that was taught in high school and I feel that this will help me in my next 3.5 years and even later in life. My funnest class by far was communication studies. The teacher was vey laid back and the class felt like a family. We did numerous speeches and to be honest I was super nervous at first, but as the semester went on, I felt good when I was in front of everybody. You will definitely learn a lot here at UT and each year it gets harder and harder to get into the school. At times it will be challenging, but you will learn so much here!, 776549=The campus is very safe. I don't have to worry about getting around on campus at any time of the day, whether it's my 8 am class or my 6:45 pm class that ends at 8:35 pm. There are Emergency Call points all throughout campus as well that can be used by anyone, student or not, to instantly call for help or assistance if needed., 1013588=I plan to attend UT in aug. 2014 I have been to the campus on a site visit and I am so looking forward to my future here. Now I am hoping to find some scholarship monies.}",

    "textAfterTable": "For the most part, UT is an enjoyable place to study, live, and learn. Found in the heart of Knoxville, the campus has some urban feel to it, while still remaining true to its Southern heritage. Greek life is big on campus, but there are also many other clubs and societies to join on campus. Dorm life also helps new students find their niche. Am learning a lot I have completed a total of 34 hours at the UT campus. So far, I have learned a lot from my professors. While some classes are huge (200+), others allow for one-on-one time with other students and faculty. Even in the 200+ classes, discussion sections are set up so students can interact with T.A.s, feel more comfortable asking questions, and to learn more about the material.
