While the Commission instituted a freeze on the acceptance of full power television rulemaking petitions requesting channel substitutions in May 2011, it subsequently announced that it would lift the freeze to accept such petitions for rulemaking seeking to relocate from channel 51 pursuant to a voluntary relocation agreement with Lower 700 MHz A Block licensees. TDS has entered into such a voluntary relocation agreement with T-Mobile USA, Inc. and states that operation on channel 18 would remove any potential interference with authorized wireless operations in the adjacent Lower 700 MHZ A Block., 61809=This document contains corrections to the final regulations to the Commission's rules which were published in the Federal Register on Thursday, November 6, 2014 (79 FR 65906).

In 2012, the Commission adopted online public file rules for broadcast television stations that required them to post public file documents to a central, FCC-hosted online database rather than maintaining the files locally at their main studios. Now that television broadcasters have completed their transition to the online file, the Commission believes it is appropriate to commence the process of expanding the online file to other media entities to extend the benefits of improved public access to public inspection files and, ultimately, reduce the burden of maintaining these files., 267759=This document requests comments on a Petition for Rule Making filed by Charles Crawford, proposing to amend the FM Table of Allotments, of the Commission's rules, by allotting Channel 247A at Bogata, Texas, as a first local service.
