The best place to eat is (currently) Simpson Dining. I would advise not eating at Lakeshore Dining, except come April we won't even have Lakeshore Dining. They are opening up a brand new student center where I'm sure there will be exceptional food., 690229=Well there are the rocks by the lake that everyone loves, and the beach on warmer days to just sit and relax. An unusual tradition would be christmas on campus or the new years party that is held almost every year. The christmas on campus is self explanatory, you basically have christmas on campus! It's wonderful because everything is decorated! The new years party is in early september and its a small celebration for all the students and staff to welcome the new academic school and wish everyone good luck in their endeavors!, 801808=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 102840=Wolf and Kettle day is in March every year when we celebrate the donors of our education and those who help pay for tuition. FUN, 18578=Do not take a class at 8:30 offered at the Water Tower Campus!One of the classes I would highly recommend is Human Values in Literature with Mr. Fruhauff. Overall, try to have an open mind about courses and balance out your schedule so that it fits your needs. Do not try to do too much in one semester but do try to get involved in extra curriculars. You will not regret it.}",

Loyola's nursing program is in the 95th percentile for the NCLEX. Tips for prospective students Apply as soon as you possibly can if you think you might want to go to Loyola, this will help you get the most aid since scholarships are on a first come, first serve basis. Also, if you plan to attempt to get into the nursing program spots fill up quickly, so the sooner you apply the better. But you should keep one thought in mind academically, it is easy to get into Loyola but hard to stay. Loyola will continuously challenge you in order to bring out your best, however it will not be easy! Bang for the buck I believe that Loyola is worth going to regardless of cost because of the outstanding faculty and program for nursing. However, it is still",
