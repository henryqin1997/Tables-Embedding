We are in contact to find a solution so please wait until we know what to do. Order in Germany (each for himself or as a group, not clear yet) could be as cheap as a 10pack. We are in contact with pulster.de and will be contacted form pulster about the price. We will contact you guys in the Z\u00fcrich list as soon as we know more --Tuxfux.ch 10:26, 6 June 2008 (UTC) Alexandre Ghisoli will not organize the second 10pack, since the order moved in the Lucca's group., 205664=status:GSM 900 variant sold out, new stocks due July 25, 2008, 259188=As of 8 July 2008 we still need five people to pay in order to complete a second batch of ten. Just because there are twenty names on this list doesn't mean you can't join in. PLEASE contact Bert or Michael in addition to adding yourself to the list, 97243=As it looks right now, it seems that it would be cheaper and easier for us to buy through Pulster in Germany - see the following email: http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-May/017778.html ~leinir, 182140=Status 10/10 - Buying via http://www.handheld-linux.com/wiki.php?page=Neo%20Freerunner, more slots available as they make discounts for buying 10+ Freerunners. Order will be placed on July 22., 270534=Status: 16/20 at 2008-05-24, 74575=Status 18/07/2007, 184890=After discussion on the talk page, a number of us have decided to place an individual order at Pulster.eu, because they are cheaper than the group sale discount, and they deliver a receipt with VAT. I'd advise the people on this group sale-list to do the same. You can indeed place a group order at Pulster.eu, but that won't lower the price, and would only add extra shipping costs. (from the person who made the group-order to the individual members of the group) MadJo 11:04, 30 June 2008 (UTC), 236452=ALREADY Ordered 18th July (Pulster.de), 214635=1x 10 Pack ordered from pulster for the group Z\u00fcrich! Read more below --Tuxfux.ch 17:20, 28 June 2008 (UTC), 205518=band: GSM 900/1800, 3G 2100, 73769=NO OpenMoko FreeRunner 900/1800 available anymore (on July 3, 2008 at 21h) as needed in Europe. Furthermore, confirmation: From Pulster.eu: Our sales price is 299 EUR + shipping 15 EUR in Europe = 314 EUR. The idea of \"open\" is ours. So check our price calculation: if you order the Freerunner from Taiwan, it's 399 USD + 100 USD shipping + c. 90 USD \"import taxes\" inside Europe. Total 589 USD = c.380 EUR. So it will be cheaper and we Europeans have 2 years of warranty when buying from Pulster, instead of a 14 days(?) for imported goods., 235945=ordering 23 July, 107483=Let's see if we can get ten people together for this. I'm willing to organise the local distribution if we can. Spread the word and try to get more locals interested in it. Yogiz 08:22, 3 June 2008 (UTC), 230227=Ordered from pulster.de on july 18th., 194291=As of 2008-07-03 (exchange rate 0.7505), US$369 is worth NZ$492 and US$25.81 is worth NZ$34.39, 218096=Figures accurate as of 4th Jun 2008 from UBS: 1EUR = 1.54USD and 1USD = 1.04CHF.}",
