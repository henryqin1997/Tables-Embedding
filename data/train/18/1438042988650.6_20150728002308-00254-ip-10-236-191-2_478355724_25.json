No. 08/556,237 filed on Nov. 9,1995, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Application Ser. No. 08/542,793 filed Oct. 13, 1995, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Application Ser.

No. 60/042,439 filed Mar. 28,1997., 216705=[0119] Polyester polyols are typically classed by molecular weight. Low molecular weight polyols (less than 1500) are used in coatings, casting compounds, and rigid foams. Medium molecular weight polyols (1550 to 2500) are used in elastomers. And, high molecular weight polyols (greater than 2500) are used in flexible foams., 306771=[0177] As used herein, \u201cShore D hardness\u201d of a cover is measured generally in accordance with ASTM D-2240, except the measurements are made on the curved surface of a molded cover, rather than on a plaque. Furthermore, the Shore D hardness of the cover is measured while the cover remains over the core. When a hardness measurement is made on a dimpled cover, Shore D hardness is measured at a land area of the dimpled cover., 145208=[0080] The inner layer in another embodiment of the invention includes a blend of a soft (low acid) ionomer resin with a small amount of a hard (high acid) ionomer resin. A low modulus ionomer suitable for use in the outer layer blend has a flexural modulus measuring from about 1,000 to about 10,000 psi, with a hardness of about 20 to about 40 on the Shore D scale. A high modulus ionomer herein is one which measures from about 15,000 to about 70,000 psi as measured in accordance with ASTM method D-790. The hardness may be defined as at least about 40 on the Shore D scale as measured in accordance with ASTM method D-2240., 243593=[0125] Elastollan\ufffd 1100 series of products are polyether-based thermoplastic polyurethanes. They exhibit excellent low temperature properties, hydrolysis resistance and fungus resistance. These products can be injection and blow molded and extruded., 73091=[0046] The inner layer compositions may include the high acid ionomers such as those developed by E. I. DuPont de Nemours & Company under the trademark Surlyn\ufffd and by Exxon Corporation under the trademarks Escor\ufffd or Iotek\ufffd, or blends thereof. Examples of compositions which may be used as the inner layer herein are set forth in detail in a continuation of U.S. Application Ser. No. 08/174,765 now abandoned, which is a continuation of U.S. Application Ser. No. 07/776,803 filed Oct. 15, 1991 now abandoned, and Ser. No. 08/493,089 now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 5,688,869, which is a continuation of 07/981,751, which in turn is a continuation of Ser. No. 07/901,660 filed Jun. 19, 1992 now abandoned, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Of course, the inner layer high acid ionomer compositions are not limited in any way to those compositions set forth in said applications., 299577=[0165] Recycling of polyurethanes by glycolysis is known from, for example, RIM Part and Mold Design\u2014Polyurethanes, 1995, Bayer Corp., Pittsburgh, Pa. Another significant advantage of the present invention is that because reaction injection molding occurs at low temperatures and pressures, i.e., 90 to 180\ufffd F. and 50 to 200 psi, this process is particularly beneficial when a cover is to be molded over a very soft core. When higher pressures are used for molding over soft cores, the cores \u201cshut off\u201d i.e., deform and impede the flow of material causing uneven distribution of cover material., 293265=[0159] The preferred method of forming a fast-chemical-reaction-produced component for a golf ball according to the invention is by reaction injection molding (RIM). RIM is a process by which highly reactive liquids are injected into a closed mold, mixed usually by impingement and/or mechanical mixing in an in-line device such as a \u201cpeanut mixer\u201d, where they polymerize primarily in the mold to form a coherent, one-piece molded article. The RIM processes usually involve a rapid reaction between one or more reactive components such as polyether\u2014or polyester\u2014polyol, polyamine, or other material with an active hydrogen, and one or more isocyanate\u2014containing constituents, often in the presence of a catalyst. The constituents are stored in separate tanks prior to molding and may be first mixed in a mix head upstream of a mold and then injected into the mold. The liquid streams are metered in the desired weight to weight ratio and fed into an impingement mix head, with mixing occurring under high pressure, e.g., 1500 to 3000 psi. The liquid streams impinge upon each other in the mixing chamber of the mix head and the mixture is injected into the mold. One of the liquid streams typically contains a catalyst for the reaction. The constituents react rapidly after mixing to gel and form polyurethane polymers. Polyureas, epoxies, and various unsaturated polyesters also can be molded by RIM., 143845=[0078] In yet another embodiment of the inner cover layer, a blend of high and low acid ionomer resins is used. These can be the ionomer resins described above, combined in a weight ratio which preferably is within the range of 10:90 to 90:10 parts of high and low acid ionomer resins., 88908=[0055] Further, Surlyn\ufffd 8162 is a zinc cation ionomer resin containing approximately 20% by weight (i.e., 18.5-21.5% weight) methacrylic acid copolymer that has been 30-70% neutralized. Surlyn\ufffd 8162 is currently commercially available from DuPont., 214838=[0116] A wide array of other isocyanates can be utilized. Examples include, but are not limited to p-phenylene diisocyanate (PPDI) (CAS Registry No. 104-494); toluene diisocyanate (TDI) (CAS Registry No. 1321-38-6); 4,4\u2032-methylenebis-(phenylisocyanate) (MDI) (CAS Registry No. 101-68-8); polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanate (PMDI) (CAS Registry No. 9016-87-9); 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate (NDI) (CAS Registry No. 3173-72-6); bitolylene diisocyanate (TODI) (CAS Registry No. 91-974); m-xylylene diisocyanate (XDI) (CAS Registry No. 3634-83-1); m-tetramethyl-xylylene (TMXDI) (CAS Registry No. 5806742-8); hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) (CAS Registry No. 822-06-0); 1,6-diisocyanato-2,2,4,4-tetra-methylhexane (TMDI) (CAS Registry No. 83748-30-5); 1,6-diisocyanato-2,4,4-trimethylhexane (TMDI) (CAS Registry No. 15646-96-5); trans-cyclohexane-1,4-diisocyanate (CHDI) (CAS Registry No. 2556-36-7); 1,3-bis(isocyanato-methyl)cyclohexane (HXDI) (CAS Registry No. 38661-72-2); 3-isocyanato-methyl-3,5,5-trimethylcyclo-hexyl isocyanate (IPDI), 155743=[0085] In addition, test data collected by the inventors indicates that Iotek\ufffd 7520 resins have Shore D hardnesses of about 32 to 36 (per ASTM D-2240), melt flow indexes of 3\ufffd0.5 g/10 min (at 190\ufffd C. per ASTM D-1 288), and a flexural modulus of about 2500-3500 psi (per ASTM D-790). Furthermore, testing by an independent testing laboratory by pyrolysis mass spectrometry indicates at Iotek\ufffd 7520 resins are generally zinc salts of a terpolymer of ethylene, acrylic acid, and methyl acrylate., 43047=[0007] This was addressed by Spalding Sports Worldwide, Inc., the assignee of the present invention, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,431,193 where a multi-layered golf ball is produced by initially molding a first cover layer on a spherical core and then adding a second layer. The first layer is comprised of a hard, high flexural modulus resinous material such as type 1605 Surlyn\ufffd (now designated Surlyn\ufffd 8940). Type 1605 Surlyn\ufffd (Surlyn\ufffd 8940) is a sodium ion based low acid (less than or equal to 15 weight percent methacrylic acid) ionomer resin having a flexural modulus of about 51,000 psi. An outer layer of a comparatively soft, low flexural modulus resinous material such as type 1855 Surlyn\ufffd (now designated Surlyn\ufffd 9020) is molded over the inner cover layer. Type 1855 Surlyn\ufffd (Surlyn\ufffd 9020) is a zinc ion based low acid (10 weight percent methacrylic acid) ionomer resin having a flexural modulus of about 14,000 psi.}",
