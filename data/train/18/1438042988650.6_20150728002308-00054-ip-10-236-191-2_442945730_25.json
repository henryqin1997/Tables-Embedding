At least two segments of battery packs are charged and discharged with two different battery management strategies, one handles transient energy needs and the other copes with cruise energy needs. The primary segment of battery are charged and discharged within a controlled State of Charge (SOC) range at a set point, it stores relatively less energy but supplies relative high impulse current during charge and discharge. The secondary segments have larger energy capacity, and are charged and discharged at constant current mode in deep cycling, near complete full charge and full discharge. These",

It includes a valve housing having an inlet end, an outlet end. A valve body located within the housing has a sealing end and a spindle. The sealing end has a teardrop shaped cross-section for cooperating with the valve housing. 02-03-2011 Jin-Jae Chen, Canton, MI US Patent application number Description Published 20100332094 COOPERATIVE TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM USING DUAL SLIP CONTROLLERS - A cooperative traction control system that integrates throttle control and torque distribution. The system also uses dual slip controllers and methods that involve controlling the distribution of torque between wheels in the front and rear axles of a vehicle and a relatively small or no adjustment of the engine throttle (or, more generally, engine torque output) to reduce wheel slip. The control is cooperative in the sense that two controllers\u2014a front axle torque controller and a rear axle torque controller\u2014work together (or are controlled together) to reduce wheel slip and",
