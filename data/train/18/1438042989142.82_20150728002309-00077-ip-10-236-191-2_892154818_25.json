The school gives you the opportunity to get really comfortable with all your professors with a 6.5:1 faculty to student ratio. This is amazing meaning the teachers will remember you name and your struggles, not some student ID number on a piece of paper. Don't skip out on any opportunities to aid you in courses, this is a very competitive school. Everyone will be looking for help both inside and outside of class, maximize your time with you professor. While attending the EPGY program, it wasn't necessarily difficult in thought, but rigorous in work., 273308=Apply early if you are really sure Stanford is your top choice. It is a great feeling to have your matriculation settled in December. Get to understand the culture of each college you apply to. Just because someone loves a certain school does not mean you will love it too. If you cannot visit the campus, try to reach out to a diverse group of students currently attending it. I say diverse so you can gain a comprehensive understanding of the school's culture and student body. The college process is overwhelming, but ask for help whenever you need it. Guidance from experienced students is extremely helpful and more accessible than you think it is., 328916=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 20930=Do not be discouraged to apply. They are looking for uniqueness and dedication into whatever you do. I had no hopes of actually making it, but I got in! I have an SAT score of 1810, which is lower than a lot of my friends who did not make it in.}",
