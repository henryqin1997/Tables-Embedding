    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6052=Maleic anhydride/Styrene co-polymer coated PVDF membranes are prepared by argon plasma treatment of BioTrace\u2122 PVDF membrane followed by an oxygen afterglow to create surface-bound peroxide. Thermal decomposition of the peroxide generates a surface radical. In the presence of maleic anhydride and styrene, a polymerisation occurs to give alternating maleic anhydride/styrene co-polymer grafted directly to the membrane surface. ATR analysis shows the presence of considerable co-polymer coating as indicated by the presence and intensity of the asymmetric doublet at 1858 and 1778 cm\u22121 (FIG. 3). The relative amount of grafted polymer can be estimated by the ratio of peak areas for MAn1818 cm \u22121/PVDF764 cm \u22121 and comparing to various graft reaction conditions. Our study shows MAn1818 cm \u22121/PVDF764 cm \u22121 of 7.52. Physically, the membrane passes the \u201cfold and stretch\u201d test for structural integrity. This observation is noteworthy because the plasma method shows considerably more graft polymer (>9\ufffd) when compared to previous samples generated by \u03b3-irradiation (ratio=0.83).}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{144180=Dissolve chromium chloride (5.0 g) into 500 mL of 0.15M saline solution and stand overnight. pH adjusted to 5.0 with 1 M NaOH thrice weekly for 4 weeks until pH was stable at 4.9. Prior to use, dilute stock solution 1:10 with 0.15M saline., 101987=Where the supporting bindings interaction is specific, the substrate may have additional features to further tune overall binding strength and specificity to a particular target molecule. In this case it may be possible to be more discerning about the target molecule that is to be immobilised. For the purposes of the invention, the specific binding interaction may arise from any molecule that may have some (weak to medium to strong) binding affinity to the target molecule including proteins, peptides, oligosaccharides, nucleic acids as well as any small molecule compounds that maybe identified by conventional lead discovery approaches used in drug discovery research. In an embodiment of the present invention the supporting binding interaction of a specific nature may be due to the inclusion at the substrate surface of a specially selected (small) molecule, such as one that has been designed in accordance with the pharmacophore approach described in Applicant's own co-pending International patent application no, PCT/AU2004/001747 the content of which is incorporated herein by reference and described below. The pharmacophore approach is particularly useful where the target molecule is a protein since it enables binding to a specific region thereof. Once identified the small molecule may be provided on the substrate surface, possibly via the kind of coating approach described above. In this embodiment, any weakly binding small molecule provides additional orientating interactions while the metal complex acts as a locking interaction with the substrate. The metal complex/es. non-specific and specific binding interactions in various combinations allows the window of effective binding to be tuned either strongly bind a general class of target molecules such as antibodies and/or to produce simple and robust ligation procedures that are effective under a broad range of conditions. Alternatively, it can also be applied to situations where a specific target molecule binds in preference over another molecule in an analyte. The term effective binding means all achieving all necessary requirements of the application such as good signal in an assay, consistent reproducibility, and stability under the required assay and storage conditions., 24458=There is a need for a simple process to immobilise biomolecules such as peptides, proteins, oligonucleotides, oligosaccharides to solid supports for various applications in drug discovery research and diagnostics. There are many approaches in the prior art such as those described in Hermanson, et. al., Bioconjugate Techniques: Academic Press, 1996, but the number of well-used methods are limited. For example, in covalent coupling methods, there are:, 23875=This is a U.S. National Stage application of International Application PCT/AU2005/000966, filed Jun. 30, 2005, published Jan. 12, 2006, under PCT Article 21(2) in English; which claims the priority of U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60/585,261, filed Jul. 2, 2004, and 60/645,053, filed Jan. 18, 2005., 336016=As a model system, two different pharmacophore ligands known to bind antibodies at the Fc fragment were used in combination with the chromium perchlorate solution ligation method to bind to PEI coated beads. One pharmacophore was Ac-Cys-Ala-Ala-Thr-Ala-Glu-Lys-Val-Phe-Lys-Gln-Tyr-Ala-Asn-Asp-OH, a peptide known to bind to the Protein G binding region of an antibody. A Cys residue was incorporated into the peptide for coupling onto the surface modified bead. The other ligand was 2-(2-carboxyethylamino)-4-anilino-6-tyramino-triazine (Apa-COOH), a small molecule known to bind to the Protein A binding region of an antibody. (R. Li, V. Dowd, D. J. Stewart, S. J. Burton and C. R. Lowe, Nature Biotechnology, 16, 1998, 190-195 Design, synthesis and application of a Protein A mimetic). Under the conditions of use, both ligands are not capable of binding the antibody with sufficient binding strength., 237916=Allow the beads (1.25\ufffd107 beads/mL) to reach room temperature and vortex the beads for sec, then sonicate for another 20 sec. If any aggregate beads are observed, repeat the vortexing and sonication. Aliquot 500-1000 uL of the bead concentrates into separate 1.7 mL microtubes (Axygen MCT-175-L-C). Centrifuge the beads at 14,000 rpm for 3 min after which the tube is removed and gently flicked to dislodge beads on the side of tire tube, then spun down again for 5 min. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant from the bead pellet in each tube., 210054=Although 1600 polymer coatings were prepared, a far larger number can easily be assembled and screened using this method. Expansion and/or variation of the 2\ufffdamine, metal salt, pH, solvent, additive, substrate material, backbone polymer structure (thickness, etc), and backbone polymer composition (monomers) are all plausible changes that can be made to improve the steric and electronic effect around the metal centre., 162234=A parallel library of 1600 novel polymer coatings on PVDF membrane was prepared and screened for antibody binding. Inputs include 40 different 2\ufffd amines (Table 2) and 40 different Cr(III) formulations (Table 3)., 340037=As well, two \u201cligands\u201d identified by the procedure described in International patent application no. PCT/AU2004/001747, to design a binding surface that has the ability to bind a target molecule in some preferred orientation was also included. 5-(4-Hydroxymethyl-3-methoxyphenoxy)valeric acid (PPh1) and glycocholic acid hydrate (PPh2) were used in combination with the chromium chloride solution ligation method to bind to PEI coated beads. Under the conditions of use, both ligands are not capable of binding the antibody with sufficient binding strength., 29005=The possibility of tuning metal complexes to some particular target molecule can be considered from one known example of chromium chloride (see Gold, E. R., Fudenberg, H. H. Chromic chloride: a coupling reagent for passive hemagglutination reactions, J. Immunol. 1967 November; 99(5), 859-66. Kofler, R., Wick, G. Some methodologic aspects of the chromium chloride method for coupling antigen to erythrocytes.). Whilst the use of chromium chloride has been known for a long time, this approach has a number of practical disadvantages/limitations and a well known reputation for poor reproducibility. For example, buffers commonly used in assays to preserve the antigen or antibodies, such as sodium azide or phosphates, can themselves interact with the metal salt in preference to the target molecule thereby overriding chelation of the antibody and metal species. The relative concentrations of the reagents used must also be carefully controlled and even minor variations can lead to poor and highly variable binding efficiency. Chromium chloride solutions need to be \u201caged\u201d for efficient and better reproducibility of ligation. From the prior art and our own studies, this ligation procedure has a very narrow window of effectiveness with even small variations in any of the parameters, including the type of target molecule, giving non-optimal results. For these reasons, this ligation procedure has been rarely used. For many solid phase applications such as multiplexed immunoassays, it is essential that tire target molecule does not detach from the substrate as this can lead to cross-contamination. Covalent attachment of the target molecule to the substrate is ideal but in many cases this can lead to target molecule damage. With affinity tags, there is less target molecule damage but then binding interaction may not be totally stable under the conditions of use. In many cases, the use of detergents or other reagents in an assay dependent on affinity binding of the target molecule on a substrate can lead to a leakage of the target molecule off the substrate. As a consequence, there are no generic methods that work in all cases and the list of useful binding interactions is relatively small. It would be desirable to provide a method of binding a target molecule to a substrate that relies on beneficial interactions that exist between a target molecule and a metal complex but that is free from the practical constraints described above. It would also be desirable to provide a method of binding a target molecule to a substrate that includes advantages such as:, 86179=In general terms, it is known that the kinetics of solid phase target molecule\u2014complementary binding molecule interactions differ significantly from liquid phase interactions involving the same reagents in solution (see, for example, Kabat, E. A., Basic principles of antigen-antibody reactions. Methods of Enzymology, Vol. 70. Colowick, S. P., and Kaplan, N. O., Eds., Academic Press., New York, 1980, P3; Karush, F., The (affinity of antibody: range, variability and the role of multivalence, in Comprehensive Immunology, Vol 5, Litman, G. W. and Good R. A., Eds., Plenum Press, New York, 1978, P85; Franz B. and Stegemann, M., The kinetics of solid phase microtiter immunoassays, CRC, 1991, Ch. 18, P277). While the reasons for these differences vary in relative importance depending on the substrate, the immobilised target molecule, and the specific experimental protocols, the underlying rational is well known. Thus, it is accepted that substrates can denature or otherwise damage target molecules immobilised on the substrate surface leading to poorer than expected binding interactions between the target molecules and complementary binding molecules., 104284=In the above embodiment, computer-based methods may be used for designing the coating such that it includes structural features that will enable the coating to immobilise a metal complex and supporting binding interactions as required in accordance with the present invention, International patent application no. PCT/AU2004/001747 describes a method of designing a binding surface that has the ability to bind a target molecule in some preferred orientation based on a subsequent binding event intended for the target molecule. The method involves identifying a suitable anchor site on the target molecule that enables binding to the substrate, whilst preserving the availability of some other binding site on the target molecule required for the subsequent binding interaction with its complementary binding molecule. A pharmacophore model is then generated for the anchor site and this involves molecular features that relate to any form of interaction through which binding may occur. Subsequently, this model is used to identify a ligand that is complementary to the anchor site and that therefore has the potential to interact with and bind the anchor site. The ligand is then provided on the surface of a substrate via a coating so that the target molecule may be bound in a preferred orientation. Similar methodology may be employed in the present invention where metal complexes and supporting binding interactions are combined. Here coordination ligand models may be used to identify functionality required in the coating in order to identify a metal complex and supporting binding interactions that may be suitable for binding a target molecule in some preferred orientation., 143688=A standard chromium chloride ligating solution was tested for its efficiency in solution ligation. Here, variables considered important for ligation (see J. W. Goding, J. Immunol. Methods, 10 1976, 61-66, The chromic chloride method of coupling antigens to erythrocytes: Definition of some important parameters) were tested by coupling TSH antibody on uncoated Luminex Beads.}",
