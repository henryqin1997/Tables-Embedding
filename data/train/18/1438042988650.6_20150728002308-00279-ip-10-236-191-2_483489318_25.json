See, Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 57th edition, CRC Press, p. C-726 (1976-1977), which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety., 43880=Nonlimiting examples of synthetic materials useful in the present invention include those selected from the group consisting of acetate fibers, acrylic fibers, cellulose ester fibers, modacrylic fibers, polyamide fibers, polyester fibers, polyolefin fibers, polyvinyl alcohol fibers, rayon fibers, polyurethane foam, and mixtures thereof. Examples of some of these synthetic materials include acrylics such as acrilan, creslan, and the acrylonitrile-based fiber, orlon; cellulose ester fibers such as cellulose acetate, arnel, and acele; polyamides such as nylons (e.g., nylon 6, nylon 66, nylon 610, and the like); polyesters such as fortrel, kodel, and the polyethylene terephthalate fiber, dacron; polyolefins such as polypropylene, polyethylene; polyvinyl acetate fibers; polyurethane foams and mixtures thereof. These and other suitable fibers and the nonwoven materials prepared therefrom are generally described in Riedel, \u201cNonwoven Bonding Methods and Materials,\u201d Nonwoven World (1987); The Encyclopedia Americana, vol. 11, pp. 147-153, and vol. 26, pp. 566-581 (1984); U.S. Pat. No. 4,891,227, to Thaman et al., issued Jan. 2, 1990; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,891,228 which are all incorporated by reference herein in their entirety., 32644=The present invention relates to disposable, single use personal cleansing articles especially useful for cleansing facial skin. Each such article comprises a) a water-insoluble, non-woven substrate having at least one cleansing surface; and b) from about 0.5% to 250% by weight of the substrate of a lathering surfactant which is releasably associated with the substrate. The cleansing surface of the substrate contains a plurality of apertures which range in size from about 0.5 mm to 5 mm in diameter. These apertures are located within said cleansing surface of the substrate at a frequency of from about 0.5-12 apertures per linear centimeter. Preferred multiple layer cleansing articles of this invention utilize a two-ply substrate wherein one or both plies are apertured. Also preferably at least one of the plies of the substrate is wet extensible and the second ply is less wet extensible than the first ply. Preferred articles are also substantially dry prior to use and contain one or more water-soluble or water-insoluble conditioning agents in addition to the lathering surfactant component., 81001=When applied as parallel stripes, lines, or bands, the adhesive can be applied to the nonwoven second layer 200 using a slot coating applicator. A suitable slot coating applicator is a Nordson MX series hot melter with extrusion head commercially available from the Nordson Company of Norcross, Ga. The H1382-01 adhesive referenced above can be applied to the second layer 200 at a temperature of about 350 Fahrenheit, at an application level of about 0.03 grams of adhesive per square inch. Immediately following application of the adhesive to the nonwoven second layer 200, the nonwoven second layer 200 and the paper first layer 100 can be bonded together by pressing the two layers 100 and 200 together with the adhesive disposed between the second layer 200 and the first layer 100. One suitable means for pressing the two layers 100 and 200 together is by passing the two layers through a nip formed between two rollers, with the rollers loaded to provide adequate nip pressure for bonding., 26950=This application is a continuation-in-part (CIP) of the following copending U.S. patent applications: U.S. Ser. No. 09/065,991, filed Apr. 24, 1998, in the names of Timothy John Fowler, Lourdes Dessus Albacarys, and David Michael McAtee (P&G Case 6335R); U.S. Ser. No. 08/861,750, filed May 22, 1997 in the names of Erik John Hasenoehrl, Lourdes Dessus Albacarys, and Timothy John Fowler (P&G Case 6652); U.S. Ser. No. 09/148,540, filed Sep. 4, 1998 in the names of Erik John Hasenoehrl and David Michael McAtee (P&G Case 6819); and U.S. Ser. No. 09/152,034, filed Sep. 11, 1998 in the names of David Michael McAtee, Nicholas James Nissing, Erik John Hasenoehrl, and David William Cabell (P&G Case 6840)., 53091=The substrate can be made into a wide variety of shapes and forms including flat pads, thick pads, thin sheets, ball-shaped implements, irregularly shaped implements, and having sizes ranging from providing a cleansing surface area of at least about 5 cm2. The exact size will depend upon the desired use and product characteristics. Especially convenient are square, circular, rectangular, or oval pads having a cleansing surface area of from about 6 cm2 to 1000 cm2, preferably from about 65 cm2 to about 775 cm2, and more preferably from about 150 cm2 to about 400 cm2, and a thickness of from about 1 mil to about 500 mil, preferably from about 5 mil to about 250 mil, and more preferably from about 10 mil to about 100 mil., 68743=It is believed that the paper strength can significantly alter the overall appearance of the complete article. The amount of crepe input to the first layer is directly proportional to the amount of planar expansion and thereby the amount of caliper generated upon wetting. However, if the wet strength of the paper article is insufficient, the \u201cbuckles\u201d may collapse to form a more \u201cwrinkled\u201d product having less caliper. Therefore both crepe and wet strength can be adjusted to provide an amount of texture based on the intended use of the article. Wet burst measurements can be made with a Thwing-Albert Burst Tester model number 1300-77, which tests peak load of a fully wetted substrate. The test utilizes a 1.3 cm ball diameter, a 12.7 cm/min ball velocity, and clamps the test sample around a 8.9 cm diameter circle perpendicular to the motion of the ball. Peak load wet burst strengths are between 100 and 1200 grams per ply. More preferably between 400 and 700 grams per ply and most preferably between 500 and 600 grams per ply., 145742=The compositions which are added onto or impregnated into the articles of the present invention may comprise a wide range of optional ingredients.

In this case, a suitable hot melt adhesive is applied and the resulting article is cooled to room temperature. Heat treatment may then be performed, for example, raising the temperature to 100 degrees Celsius for 20 seconds is sufficient to initiate contraction of the polymer network. While not being bound by theory, it is believed that for this process to be effective, the pattern of bonding must be a continuous or essentially continuous network. Discrete bond sites may not sufficiently contract to improve the appearance of the article., 45149=Nonwoven substrates made from natural materials consist of webs or sheets most commonly formed on a fine wire screen from a liquid suspension of the fibers.

Methods for measuring mildness, or inversely the irritancy, of surfactant containing articles, are based on a skin barrier destruction test. In this test, the milder the surfactant, the lesser the skin barrier is destroyed. Skin barrier destruction is measured by the relative amount of radio-labeled (tritium labeled) water (3H\u2014H2O) which passes from the test solution through the skin epidermis into the physiological buffer contained in the diffusate chamber. This test is described by T. J. Franz in the J. Invest. Dermatol., 1975, 64, pp. 190-195; and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,673,525, to Small et al., issued Jun. 16, 1987, which are both incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Other testing methodologies for determining surfactant mildness well known to one skilled in the art can also be used.}",
