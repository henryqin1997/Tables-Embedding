For example, Chkdsk can repair problems related to bad sectors, lost clusters, cross-linked files, and directory errors. For NTFS formatted disks, the Windows XP Professional version of Chkdsk.exe can provide substantial performance improvements (compared to the versions in Windows 2000 Professional and Windows NT Workstation 4.0) when using the new the /i and /c parameters.

You cannot use Windows 2000 versions of Ntldr and Ntdetect.com to start Windows XP Professional. To restore these system files, use the procedure that follows., 315629=Analyzing the preceding PathPing report, the link between 172.16.87.218 (hop 1) and 192.168.52.1 (hop 2) has a 13 percent drop-packet rate. Dropped packets represent data that needs to be retransmitted, which adversely affects data throughput. All other links appear to be functioning normally with 0 percent packet-loss rates.
