The administration volume was 20-25 pl/50 grams of body weight. The animal was gently held by one hand, and the compound solution was delivered by the other hand using a pipette with fine tips. The rate of delivery was such that the full amount was given in not less than 60 seconds to ensure maximal absorption. Pre-weighed food was given to the animals immediately after dosing, and animals had free access to water throughout the study. Food weighing was performed at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours after dosing. On occasion, food weighing was also taken at the 8 hour or 24 hour time point. Animals were euthanized using carbon dioxide followed by cervical dislocation at the end of the experiment., 29011=[0008] Published PCT applications WO2001/55109, WO2001/55107 and WO2001/55016 disclose aromatic amines and/or amides for the treatment of obesity, anorexia, inflammation, mental disorders and other diseases associated with the melanocortin receptors or related systems. The disclosed amines and amides have been shown to bind to melanocortin receptors (e.g., MC-1, MC-3, MC-4 and/or MC-5) and function as either agonists or antagonists of a specific MC-receptor or of multiple MC-receptors., 27249=[0006] Furthermore, observations in connection with endogenous MC4-R antagonists indicate that MC4-R is implicated in endogenous energy regulation. For example, an agouti protein is normally expressed in the skin and is an antagonist of the cutaneous MC receptor involved in pigmentation, MC1-R. M. M. Ollmann et al., Science, 278:135-138 (1997). However, overexpression of agouti protein in mice leads to a yellow coat color due to antagonism of MC1-R and increased food intake and body weight due to antagonism of MC4-R. L. L. Kiefer et al., Biochemistry, 36: 2084-2090 (1997); D. S. Lu et al., Nature, 371:799-802 (1994). Agouti related protein (AGRP), an agouti protein homologue, antagonizes MC4-R but not MC1-R. T. M. Fong et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 237:629-631 (1997). Administration of AGRP in mice increases food intake and causes obesity but does not alter pigmentation. M. Rossi et al., Endocrinology, 139:4428-4431 (1998). Together, this research indicates that MC4-R participates in energy regulation, and therefore, identifies this receptor as a target for a rational drug design for the treatment of obesity., 37241=[0023] The instant invention provides for methods and compositions to treat MC4-R mediated disorders comprising intranasal delivery of low molecular weight, small molecule agonists of MC4-R. Thus, there has been provided, in accordance with one aspect of the invention, the intranasal delivery of the guanidine derivatives disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60/230,565, filed Aug. 31, 2000; 60/245,579, filed Nov. 6, 2000; 60/282,847, filed Apr. 9, 2001; 60/353,183, filed Feb. 4, 2002; and 60/353,188, filed Feb. 4, 2002.

At 8:30 am the next morning, they were dosed with 25 \u03bcl of vehicle or compound solution by intranasal delivery. The solution was delivered using a pipette with protein loading tips. The rate of delivery was such that the full amount was given in not less than 60 seconds. Mice were fed with pre-weighed food immediately after dosing, and had access to water the entire time. Food weight was measured at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours following the dosing., 64562=[0067] The composition may be dispensed intranasally as a powdered or liquid nasal spray, suspension, nose drops, a gel or ointment, through a tube or catheter, by syringe, by packtail, by pledget, or by submucosal infusion. The compounds of the preferred embodiments of the present invention may be conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray using a pressurized pack or a nebulizer and a suitable propellant, e.g., without limitation, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane or carbon dioxide.

Mice were euthanized at the end of the study using CO2 followed by cervical dislocation., 26329=[0005] The melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R) is a seven-transmembrane receptor. MC4-R may participate in modulating the flow of visual and sensory information, coordinate aspects of somatomotor control, and/or participate in the modulation of autonomic outflow to the heart. Science 257:1248-125 (1992). Significantly, inactivation of this receptor by gene targeting has resulted in mice that develop a maturity onset obesity syndrome associated with hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia. Cell Jan 10; 88(1): 131-41 (1997). MC4-R has also been implicated in other disease states including erectile disorders, cardiovascular disorders, neuronal injuries or disorders, inflammation, fever, cognitive disorders, and sexual behavior disorders. Hadley M.E. and Haskell-Luevano C., The Proopiomelanocortin System, Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci., 885:1 (1999)., 30091=[0010] Fehm et al. describe the role of melanocortins in the long-term control of fat stores in humans. Fehm et al. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism 86:1144-1148(2001). In this study, melanocyte stimulating hormone/adrenocorticotropin4-10(MSH/ACTH4-10) and desacetyl-\u03b1MSH were intranasally administered to various subjects. Fehm et al. discloses that intranasal administration of MSH/ACTH4-10 reduced body fat, on the average. Additionally, plasma leptin levels and insulin levels decreased after intranasal administration of MSH/ACTH4-10. In contrast, changes after intranasal administration of desacetyl-\u03b1MSH remained nonsignificant. According to the authors, the finding of reduced body adiposity after MSH/ACTH4-10 confirmed, and extended to the human, the findings of animal models indicating an essential role of the hypothalamic melanocortin system in body weight control., 111992=[0094] Mice were fasted overnight.
