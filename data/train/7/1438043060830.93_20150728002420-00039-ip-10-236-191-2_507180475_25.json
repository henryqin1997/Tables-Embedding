It is certainly true, as stated in the former report, that, by the law, all captains over fifteen years' standing rank with the highest grade acknowledged in the army, that of major general. So far, therefore, as this goes, there is a perfect equality among the captains over fifteen years' standing. It is not the less true, however, that by the terms of the act approved 25th February, 1799, it is expressly stated in the third section, \"That, whenever any officer, as aforesaid, shall be employed in the command of a squadron, on separate service, the allowance of rations to such commanding officer shall be doubled during the continuance of such command, and no longer, except in the case of the commanding officer of the navy, whose allowance, while in service, shall always be at the rate of sixteen rations per day.\" The increased compensation, therefore, to the senior officer, is in lieu of the double rations originally allowed him by law, and is believed to be due him on every principle as well of justice as of law. Abrogate the principles contained in the act above quoted, and the pecuniary loss is the smallest injury inflicted. You degrade the point of honor by assailing the pride of rank; you wound the veteran by lowering him in the estimation of his peers; and you commit a flagrant act of injustice by repealing that which the law originally allowed, and which the rules and regulations have since constantly confirmed., 468637=In compliance with the request contained in your letter of the 2d instant, accompanied by the letter of the Hon. John G. Watmough, &c., I have the honor to transmit herewith \"a statement showing the difference between the pay of the officers of the United States navy, as proposed by bill No. 334, reported by a select committee of the House of Representatives, 28th February, 1834, and the pay as proposed in the amendment to said bill, reported by said committee 17th May, 1834.\", 468489=Treasury Department, Fourth Auditor's Office, June 6, 1834., 140948=In estimating the increase of the allowance for transportation, I have taken the actual expenditure of the year terminating with the 30th of September, 1833, as the standard. The amount expended during that year, without including anything for the dragoons, amounted to $59,184. The organic laws authorize 705 officers to the army, 456 of whom are allowed, when traveling on duty without troops, ten cents per mile, and 249 twelve cents per mile; the bill referred to allows sixteen cents per mile to all. Hence, it will be seen that 456 x 10 + 249 X 12 : $59,184 : : 705 X 16 : $88,433, making the difference stated above., 127566=Paymaster General's Office, March 18, 1834., 940=Mr. Watmough, from the select committee appointed on the 27th of December last to inquire into the expediency of equalizing the pay of the officers of the army and navy of the United States, and to which the bill to equalize and regulate the pay of the officers of the army and navy of the United States had been recommitted, reported:, 142236=Paper marked A, exhibits the sums paid to the chief engineer, the chief of ordnance, and the inspectors general, through this department, in 1833, for fuel and quarters, and for transportation of baggage. A portion of the amount paid to the senior inspector general was for claims which accrued in 1832. I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,, 152419=This allowance is contingent, and cannot be granted unless the servants are actually employed. If it were intended solely as an emolument, as is frequently supposed, it would be of no importance to the government, and for the interest of the officer, that it should be granted without the condition of employment; but this is not the case; the good of the service, as well as the convenience of officers, requiring that the expense of employing servants should be incurred. It would not do for officers on a march, near an enemy, or in many other situations, to neglect their proper and important duties to look after their baggage, take care of their horses, or to cook their provisions. The compensation for servants is made under the heads of pay, subsistence, and clothing; the two last are included for the same reason that subsistence forms a part of the compensation for services, namely, that they may be obtained in all situations, and at a reasonable price; they may, therefore, be drawn in kind, or commuted, as officers shall elect. The effect of granting a fixed sum, in lieu of this allowance, would be to hold out an inducement to dispense with the employment of waiters, which, it has been shown, Would be injurious to the service. It is true, servants are frequently a convenience to officers, independent of their public duties; but this is incidental; the true reason for allowing them is that the interest of the government is promoted by employing waiters, instead of officers, to perform menial duties., 147259=Transportation of baggage, or traveling allowance, including his transportation when traveling in Europe in 1832, reimbursed since his return in 1833, 26760=War Department, March 25, 1834., 181131=An estimate showing the difference between the present pay of the officers of the United States navy, and the pay as proposed by a bill reported by a select committee of the Souse of Representatives, February 28, 1834., 169409=\u2014Herewith you will receive \"an estimate showing the difference between the present pay of the officers of the United States navy, and the pay as proposed by a bill reported by a select committee of the House of Representatives, 28th of February, 1834,\" which is believed to approximate to entire accuracy., 146678=Quarters and fuel, from 1st June, 1832, to 30th November, 1833, 466630=Navy Department, June 7, 1834., 469811=A statement showing the difference between the pay of the officers of the United States navy, as proposed by bill No. 334, reported by a select committee of the House of Representatives, 28th February, 1834, and the pay as proposed in the amendment to said bill, reported by said committee 17th May, 1834., 143865=Quarters and fuel, from 1st January to 31st December, 125845=The first column in the above table is a full estimate of the pay and all allowances that officers are now entitled to receive through the pay department.
