There is a ton of other activities to do, but the hubbub surrounds the football field., 165369=the academic staff at ewu are full of life and knowledge and care about the success of students. topics are current and curriculum is in line with what's happening in 2012., 499810=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 138063=I have previously attended EWU from 2003 to 2007. I really enjoyed the small class sizes, the accessibility of the campus, the resources and the classes I took., 448=EWU is good for all types of students! Its really ideal for students that are looking for a university experience without spending a lot of money. If you are looking for one on one help or meeting with your professor Eastern has about 24:1 ratio in most classes so you will never have a problem talking to your professor and setting a meeting time if you need help.}",

Even though we are small, we have quite a diverse population in both; ethnicity and career paths. Tips for prospective students Just be ready to become apart of the EWU family. The academic advisors are amazing, if you have any questions just give them a call and they can help you out. Bang for the buck I live a bit further away from Cheney, so I have a 40 minute commute. What I love about being a student at EWU is that you are able to ride the city transportation for free anytime you want. I love how clean and easy the bus system is because it saves me a lot of money not having to buy gas for",
