Examples of such monomers which are commercially available include \u03a9-methoxypolyethylene glycol acrylate., 47919=Preferred isocyanate-reactive compounds which are free from ionic arid non-ionic water-dispersing groups include organic polyol(s) and/or polyamine(s). Preferred organic polyols or polyamines have a Mn up to 3000, more preferably up to 2000, especially from 400 to 2000. Preferred organic polyols are diols. The diols include members of any of the chemical classes of diols used or proposed to be used in polyurethane formulations. In particular, the diols are preferably polyesters, polyesteramides, polyethers (other than ones providing polyoxyethylene groups), polythioethers, polycarbonates, polyacetals, polyolefins or polysiloxanes. Further examples of optional diols which are free from ionic and non-ionic water-dispersing groups include organic diols having an Mn below 400. Examples of such diols include ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, bis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate, cyclohexane dimethanol, and furan dimethanol., 66704=The weight ratio of water-miscible organic solvent to water-immiscible organic solvent in the composition is preferably 19:1 to 1:1, more preferably 8:1 to 1:1, especially 5:1 to 1:1., 51099=When component (a) is a hydrophilic polyester polymer, the Mn is preferably in the range from more than 500 to less than 30,000, more preferably in the range from 1000 to 25,000., 104887=Polymer Composition 4 the ratio of component 3(a) to component 3(b) is 80:20, and for, 61637=The weight ratio of component (a) to component (b) is preferably from 5:95 to 99:1, more preferably from 5:95 to 95:5, especially from 5:95 to 50:50, more especially from 5:95 to 40:60, most especially of from 10:90 to 40:60., 29195=This application is the National Phase of International Application PCT/GB00/00703 filed Feb. 28, 2000 which designated the U.S. and that International Application was published under PCT Article 21(2) in English., 104786=Polymer Composition 3 the ratio of component 3(a) to component 3(b) is 90:10, for, 68379=In addition to components (a), (b), (c) and (d), the composition optionally contains other components, such as a biocide, for example Proxel GXL (Proxel is a trade mark of Avecla Limited) or Kathon (Kathon is a trade mark of Rohm and Haas), a fungicide, a rheological agent, e.g. a wax (e.g. beeswax), a clay (e.g. bentonite), an IR absorber, or a fluorescent brightener, for example C.I.Fluorescent Brightener 179 and/or UV absorber, for example hydroxy phenylbenzotriazole. Furthermore the compositions optionally contain a surface active agent, wetting agent and/or an emulsifier, for example those described in McCutcheon's Emulsifiers and Detergents 1996 International Edition or in Surfactants Europa 3rd Edition 1996 each of which is incorporated herein by reference., 61882=In a preferred embodiment the weight ratio of component (a) to component (b) is from 99:1 to 90:50, preferably from 99:1 to 60:40, more preferably 99:5 to 60:40. This embodiment is preferred because compositions containing these ratios of components (a) to (b) perform particularly well in thermal ink-jet printers. Inks prepared from these compositions are stable, and prints prepared using the inks give a good performance in terms of wet rubfastness, light-fastness and highlighter smear resistance., 90833=Polymer Composition 2 comprises a blend of component 2(a) with component 2(b) where the ratio of component 2(a) to component 2(b) is 42:58., 171309=Polymer Compositions 7, 8 and 9 comprise components (a) and (b) where component (b) is prepared by an in-situ emulsion polymerisation in the presence of component (a) where the ratio of component (a) to component (b) is 35:35 w/w., 104992=Polymer Composition 5 the ratio of component 3(a) to component 3(b) is 70:30., 111030=Materials 1, 2, 3, and 4 were added to a reactor and stirred under N2. Material 5 was added to the reactor and heated to 50\ufffd C. with continuous stirring under N2. Dibutyl tin dilaurate was added to the reactor and heated to 90\ufffd C. for three hours before removing a sample for isocyanate content determination. This was repeated until the isocyanate content (NCO) had reached 4.66%, after which Jeffamine M1000 is added to the reactor and stirred for one hour at 90\ufffd C. The reaction mixture is dispersed into a mixture of ammonia (35%) and de-ionised water and stirred for one hour at room temperature, before filtering the dispersion through a 50 \u03bcm mesh. Further de-ionised water was added to take the emulsion to 10% solids w/w., 192539=Component 7(b) is NeoRez R2001, an aliphatic modified polyurethane dispersion, with a Mn >50,000. Component 8(b) is NeoRez 970, an aliphatic polyether polyurethane dispersion with a Mn >50,000. Each component 7(b) and 8(b) was combined with deionised water to take the dispersion to 10% solids w/w. (NeoRez and NeoResins are trade marks of Avecia BV)., 69708=The composition preferably has a total concentration of divalent and trivalent metal ions below 5000, more preferably below 1000, especially below 100, more especially below 20 parts per million by weight relative to the total weight of the composition., 49338=The relative amounts of the organic polyisocyanate and the isocyanate-reactive compounds are preferably selected such that the mole ratio of isocyanate groups to isocyanate-reactive groups is about 2:1 to 1:2, preferably from about 1.4:1 to 1:1.4. Alternatively an isocyanate-group terminated polyurethane prepolymer may be prepared in a two stage process either in solvent or as a melt, wherein the ratio of isocyanate groups to isocyanate-reactive groups is from about 1.1:1 to 2:1, preferably from about 1.1:1 to 1.9:1.}",
