            "The campuses are pretty safe, but sometimes homeless people will come in and steal things that are unsupervised.",
            "A decent range of clubs, including International Club and a good graphic design club. Again, things are still new and you have the ability to create unusual traditions.",
            "Adults who want to learn more and get new job opportunities, high school graduates who plan to transfer to university in Utah, or work as soon as possible.",
            "None, but SLCC is an up-and-coming community college--so things are still new and you have the ability to create unusual traditions.",
            "Snowball fights, or cheap movie tickets, Hogle zoo tickets provided by Student Association.",
            "Decent at the main campus (Taylorsville Redwood), but otherwise pretty bad. Go off-campus to eat.",
            "People commute--there are no dorms.",
            "Very little homework, pretty laid-back, (it's a community college).",
            "SLCC provides the opportunities, but you have to be smart and push yourself. It is a community college, not a university, where people are adults and take classes in order to get work. Also research and compare the instructors for your classes before-hand to insure you're getting the kind of teacher you want.",
            "A decent sized community college that allows for the student's choice of teachers. There is a great film, music, animation, photography programs, and a developing theater program. Also a new Digital Media Arts Center is near completion--promising additional resources and the chance to create yourself."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{53228=Great! The monthly tuition for a full time student (12-18 credits) is only $1466. At Utah Valley University it was $2380. Almost all the professors are Adjunct Professors meaning they get no benefits and less pay. So the professors are all there because they love to teach and work with students., 4913=My tips would be to develop good study habits (classes such as LE 1020 are good to take for college freshmen and everyone else), learn of the various resources on campus, start school with a good attitude, and set goals and achieve them., 784701=Salt Lake Community College had a food court in every campus. There's a grill, cafe, pizzeria, deli, and a coffee shop provided to students. I personally have not tried most of the food within the food court in SLCC but I have tried the cajun fries at the Champions Grill and it was absolutely amazing. It seems to always be filled with students so i'm guessing the food at the Bruin food court is absolutely amazing., 541628=If you are going to apply for financial aide, do it fast! Sign up for classes at 12:01 am of the day you can sign up. Work hard and do your best!, 13590=The best part of SLCC is the low cost of tuition. Currently tuition for 12-18 credits is about $1,400. Compared to the University of Utah for example, that's about $1000-$1900 difference! Students can get a great 2-year education relatively cheap and either transfer to a 4-year college or stop at graduation. Either way they save money!, 685858=SLCC is definitely worth your time & money. A full time student will pay about 1700 dollars, pre books, for a semester. It's a great deal compared to other colleges!, 540156=It's Utah! You can ski, snowboard, water-ski, hike, swim, snow-shoe, rock climb, bike, run, see a REAL game, the Jazz, tour the 2002 Olympic sites..., 756582=The tuition for a semester was about $1300 depending on how many classes you take. This price was for 12 semester hours., 216329=Classes are usually pretty cheap. To take 12 credit hours worth of classes is only about 1500 dollars. Books are a bit expensive, but you can buy them used, and then sell them online. Also, students at SLCC have an option to purchase a discounted pass to ride the trax train which goes across the valley, making for an easy method of transportation., 790741=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 31840=During high school I took Math 2210/Multivariate Calculus and Math 2250/Differential Equations and Linear Algebra from SLCC during release time. The classes were excellent. They were at least as rigorous as the equivalent courses at other Utah schools and probably more so, since they met 5 hours a week even though they were only articulated as 3 and 4 credit classes. Dr. Ronald McKay isn't the best math teacher, but he's extremely friendly and very good at explaining things in simple, understandable terms. You can go to Dr. McKay for anything, and he knows you personally and inquires after you as a friend. Dr. Costello isn't as friendly and is prone to long, irrelevant tangents, but he's a math teacher par excellence. Dr. Costello proves and derives EVERYTHING, so you learn the fundamentals from him and thus understand the material more than you would otherwise., 765151=Very cheap college a full time semester (12 credits) cost me $1700, 311486=Average cost for 12 credits is 1500 dollars. They give you a reasonable price for the credits you receive., 454099=Intro classes are not bad. As you move up though into the 2000 level classes, difficulty level does rise., 464954=Depending on your major, you may have to take courses that are a bit rigorous. For example English 2010 was pretty intense, as well as any college level physics course. Other than that if you study hard enough you'll do just fine at Salt Lake Community College.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here There are so many resources, especially in the Taylorsville Redwood campus, for students just starting out. Each building has something that can somehow help students. The student center is the main building, and it has everything for every student. There are volunteer opportunities that students can take advantage of with the Thayne Learning Center, free health check-ups with the health and wellness center, a financial aid office that helps students with financial aid such as FAFSA or general scholarships, and so much more. There are various computer labs in various areas that students can use for free. In the administration building, there is an office that aids students in getting jobs on- or off campus. There are so many things that students can do on campus. Am learning a lot Salt Lake Community College is a place of learning...when one has the right attitude. With the wide variety of classes, from the general algebra and basic biology to the complex anatomy and astronomy, students can take classes related to their majors or classes for fun. There are even classes where students can learn how to be master students and go through college with flying colors. Login to rate or flag the reviews",
