            "NVC has clubs, however, the advertising for them is not well done.",
            "NVC has a cafe and a bookstore that both serve food and snacks. The bookstore has affordable food, however it is mostly snacks and nothing filling. The cafe has sandwiches, soup, paninis, chips, soda, etc., however, most the food is very high priced.",
            "As it is at any other college, you can expect to spend anywhere from an hour and thirty minutes in class to three hours in class with about two hours hours of homework per class.",
            "One major tip is to get to campus about an hour early for class (at least) because parking is a nightmare. As well, apply for the FAFSA and immediately check for eligibility for the BOGS fee waiver, this helped me with finances over the past two years.",
            "Napa Valley College is a fantastic starting school for students who can't afford a 4-year college right away. The teachers are extremely helpful and qualified. NVC is affordable and well worth the two years I have spent here."

Tips for prospective students Prospective students should immediately speak with a councilor who will help the student determine the classes that are transferable and the courses required for particular degrees. If the student is unsure which course of study to pursue the I recommend taking classes that are transferable and that also fulfill requirements for general education just in case the student decides to pursue a four year university later in the future. Bang for the buck Financially i believe",
