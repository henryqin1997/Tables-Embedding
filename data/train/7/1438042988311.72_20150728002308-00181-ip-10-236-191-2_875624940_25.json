    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{112448=The Patriots scored three touchdowns in a span of 53 seconds, becoming the third team since the AFL-NFL merger to do so.[11] (The 2002 Seahawks did it in 52 seconds while the 1998 Falcons in 49 seconds.) For the second week in a row, the Patriots tied a franchise record set in their 2009 Week 6 game against the Tennessee Titans\u2014in this case, 35 second-quarter points, including the infamous butt fumble returned for a touchdown. Unlike the Titans game, though, where the Patriots held the ball for 9 minutes and 22 seconds, in this quarter the Patriots held the ball for just 2 minutes and 14 seconds, with the offense running just six plays in the entire quarter., 91167=Coming off their win in Buffalo against the Bills, the Patriots returned to Foxborough to host the Denver Broncos, and Peyton Manning. This was the 13th meeting between quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Tom Brady since 2001, and the 17th overall meeting between Manning and the Patriots. The Patriots grabbed the early lead, with Brady connecting on an 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Wes Welker. The Broncos responded early in the second quarter, with Manning tossing a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Joel Dreessen. However, the Patriots reeled off 24 unanswered points, with running back Shane Vereen rushing for a 1-yard touchdown, a 23-yard field goal by placekicker Stephen Gostkowski just before halftime, followed in the third quarter by Brady scoring a 1-yard touchdown on a quarterback sneak and running back Stevan Ridley rushing for an 8-yard touchdown. The latter touchdown occurred after a Manning fumble deep in Broncos' territory. The Broncos responded, with Manning throwing a pair of touchdown passes\u2014a 2-yarder to wide receiver Eric Decker, followed in the fourth quarter by a 5-yarder to wide receiver Brandon Stokley to close the gap to 31\u201321 with 6:43 remaining. Following a Patriots' fumble, the Broncos were attempting to rally. However, running back Willis McGahee fumbled the football at the Patriots' 14-yard line with 3:48 remaining, halting the Broncos' rally attempt. The Patriots subsequently ran out the clock., 118815=Tom Brady threw four touchdowns in New England's first home game against the Houston Texans since 2006. Donte Stallworth played his first game with the Patriots since August training camp (and first official game since 2007) and caught a 63-yard touchdown, but following the game was diagnosed with an ankle injury and placed on IR. The win pushed the Patriots to 10\u20133 while the Texans fell to 11\u20132., 79691=With the loss the Patriots fell to 1\u20131, 10\u20131 in home openers at Gillette Stadium, and 18\u20133 against NFC opponents at Gillette Stadium. The Patriots offense was lethargic all day long against a dominant Arizona defense, until late in the 4th Quarter, as Tom Brady hit TE Rob Gronkowski for a chance to tie the game. However, the 2-point conversion attempt failed, and the scoreline retained a 2-point lead to the visitors, 20\u201318. On the ensuing drive, however, Cardinals RB Ryan Williams fumbled with 1:01 left, giving the Patriots the ball on the Cardinals 30-yard line. Danny Woodhead took a 30-yard rushing play into the endzone, but the score was nullified by a holding call on Gronkowski. The Patriots elected to attempt a seemingly routine 42-yard field goal to win the game, but Stephen Gostkowski's kick went wide left, sealing an upset win for Arizona, and a rare loss at home for Bill Belichick's side., 133277=Tom Brady became the winningest quarterback in NFL playoff history with his 17th postseason win, breaking a tie with Joe Montana; it was also the 450th victory (regular season and playoffs) in franchise history. The win put the Patriots into the AFL-AFC Title Game for the tenth time in franchise history (ninth under the AFC banner) and a rematch of the 2011 title game (as well as a rematch of Week 3) with the Baltimore Ravens., 83265=The Patriots were hoping to stave off a losing streak and rebound from their loss to the Cardinals. In this rematch of the AFC Championship, the Patriots started off fast, with the score 13\u20130 after the first quarter. The Ravens then scored two straight touchdowns to take a 14\u201313 lead with 1:47 left in the half. Right before the half Brady scored a touchdown to retake the lead, 20\u201314. In the second half Ray Rice scored a touchdown to allow Baltimore to retake a 21\u201320 lead. Then the Patriots scored another touchdown to take a 27\u201321 lead. On a subsequent drive Baltimore's defense held New England to a field goal to make the score 30\u201321 New England. Then Joe Flacco engineered a touchdown drive to trim the lead to 30\u201328 New England. New England attempted to increase their lead, but Brady was sacked and the Patriots were forced to punt. In the end Baltimore was able to run out the clock, with Justin Tucker kicking a controversial field goal to take the game 31\u201330 just as time expired., 88295=In the Patriots' 52\u201328 win over the Buffalo Bills, they became only the second team in NFL history\u2014after the 2008 Green Bay Packers\u2014to have two players with 100 yards receiving (Welker and Gronkowski) and two players with 100 yards rushing (Bolden and Ridley) in the same game.[10], 127025=With the shutout win, the Patriots ended their regular season at 12\u20134, and they swept their AFC East rivals for the first time since 2007. The win also clinched the AFC's No. 2 seed, following the Texans' loss to the Colts earlier that day., 14579=The Patriots traded their fifth-round selection and a 2013 sixth-round selection to the Cincinnati Bengals in exchange for wide receiver Chad Johnson.[3] They also tried to improve their defense when they traded their fifth-round selection to the Washington Redskins for defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth and their sixth-round selection to the Philadelphia Eagles in exchange for linebacker Tracy White and the Eagles' seventh-round selection.[4] The Patriots also traded two seventh-round selections\u2014one to the Kansas City Chiefs in exchange for safety Jarrad Page,[5] and another to the Minnesota Vikings along with Randy Moss in exchange for a 2011 third-round selection.[6], 95282=Coming off their win against Denver, the Patriots flew to Seattle to play their only game on the west coast of the season. After starting the first half with a 17\u201310 lead, the Patriots would only score two field goals in the second half. With 7:21 remaining in the fourth quarter, Russell Wilson connected with Braylon Edwards for a 10-yard TD pass to get the Seahawks to 23\u201317. After forcing the Patriots to go three and out twice, the Seahawks got the ball back and Wilson connected with Sidney Rice for a 46-Yard TD, taking the lead 24\u201323 with 1:18 remaining. With the surprising loss, the Patriots fell to 3\u20133. The loss also leaves them 0\u20132 against the NFC West., 113683=Also, the Patriots scored the most points in consecutive weeks (108) and in a four-week period (190) since the 1950 Los Angeles Rams.[12], 102242=On November 1 in a deadline deal, New England shipped a 2013 4th round pick to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for cornerback Aqib Talib and a 2013 7th round pick., 6055=The Patriots' 12-win season marked their tenth consecutive 10-win season, a feat exceeded only by the San Francisco 49ers' streak of 16, from 1983 to 1998, and their twelfth consecutive winning season. However, on January 20, 2013, they were defeated by the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship Game, marking their first AFC title game loss at home., 13461=On May 15, Wes Welker signed his franchise tender of 1 year for $9.5 million. He was still permitted to negotiate a long term deal until July 15, which passed, and a new contract cannot be negotiated until the end of the season.[2] Looking for a replacement of Chad Ochocinco who struggled, The Patriots signed Brandon Lloyd. Looking to replace BenJarvus Green-Ellis, the Patriots signed Joseph Addai. When Joseph Addai was released, Shane Vereen moved up to the 3 runningback split., 101231=The Patriots faced the St. Louis Rams in London in a rematch of Super Bowl XXXVI. This time, the matchup proved lopsided, as the Patriots responded to the Rams' opening-drive touchdown by scoring 45 unanswered points. Brady threw for 304 yards and 4 touchdowns, 2 each to Lloyd and Gronkowski. The Patriots improved to 2\u20130 in games played in London, having defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers there in 2010., 4018=The 2012 New England Patriots season was the franchise's 43rd season in the National Football League and 53rd overall. The Patriots did not improve upon their 13\u20133 record, finishing at 12\u20134, but did win the AFC East for the fourth season in a row, and a first-round bye as one of the top two seeds in the AFC for the third consecutive year. This season marks head coach Bill Belichick's 13th season as Patriots head coach, and the 11th season in which the Patriots played all of their home games at Gillette Stadium., 84271=With this loss New England fell to 1\u20132. The Ravens not only avenged the AFC Championship defeat by winning their first-ever regular season meeting against their opponent, but the Patriots faced their first sub-.500 record in 145 games since starting the 2003 season 0\u20131 against the Buffalo Bills, and also stumbled to their first 1\u20132 start since 2001. This was the fourth time in the previous ten seasons the Pats had lost consecutive games. Also, in what turned out to be the replacement officials' next-to-last game officiating, the game was marred by a series of questionable calls that eventually provoked the Ravens fans to start chanting derogatory words towards the referees; Patriots coach Bill Belichick was seen to try to grab one of the officials as they were scurrying from the field., 5030=The 2012 Patriots featured a prolific offense that broke the record for first downs in a season, with 444, and finished third all-time in scoring, with 557 points, finishing only behind the 2011 Green Bay Packers and their previous 2007 record setting season. Additionally, this was the third consecutive season that the Patriots exceeded 500 points scored, which tied the record set by the 1999\u2013 2001 St. Louis Rams. The Patriots also ranked first in the league with a turnover margin of +25.[1], 88784=The Patriots were losing just under 4 minutes into the 2nd half after a Donald Jones 68-yard touchdown for the Bills but the Patriots recovered scoring 35 unanswered points and 45 points in the 2nd half total to crush the Bills. Brady threw for 340 yards and 3 touchdowns while Bolden (137 yards, 1 touchdown) and Ridley (106 yards, 2 touchdowns) chimed in to make it the most points the Patriots had scored since 2009 as the team improved to 2\u20132., 85244=The Patriots were one of six 2011 season playoff teams to be under .500 after their first three games; the others were the Steelers, Broncos, Lions, Packers, and Saints (who were sitting at 0\u20133 by this time)., 121605=In a bitterly fought affair in cold rain, the Patriots fell to 10\u20134 and snapped their 21-game winning streak at home in December, the longest such winning streak in the NFL at the time. The Patriots fell to 18\u20134 at Gillette Stadium against NFC teams and have lost three straight home contests in interconference games. The 49ers raced to a 31\u20133 lead in the third quarter off four Patriots turnovers (two of them Brady interceptions), but the Patriots rallied to score four touchdowns. A 63-yard kick return set up Colin Kaepernick's fourth touchdown pass of the game and a failed fourth-down conversion attempt led to a Niners field goal.}",
