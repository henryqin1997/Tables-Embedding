            "The Citadel has its own public safety sector that patrols the school and the surrounding vicinity. TAC Officers keep watch over the cadets to maintain proper discipline and behavior.",
            "The Citadel is unique in that it mainly has companies just as the military does, although it does have academic fraternities: one for business majors and one for engineering majors.",
            "The Citadel has intramural sports where cadets compete against each other. The largest club it features is The Citadel Republican Society. Many majors, especially business, have individual clubs such as the Supply Chain Management Club. The school also has its own Rotaract Club, which I myself am joining because I enjoy community service with my peers.",
            "Students looking to go into the military, or virtually any other career path. Students that want a challenge. Knob year is supposed to be the toughest year of your life.",
            "The school itself was involved in a number of battles during the Civil War and the Mexican-American war. Every Friday the school holds a Parade which features a Pass and Review for tourists to visit and observe a little bit of what life is like for cadets and the military discipline they are trained with.",
            "Upon graduation from The Citadel, you become part of a network of alumni that support each other and are able to help you with anything such as helping you start your career.",
            "Charleston is a wonderful place to leave campus for an afternoon run, as well as on the weekends there are many things to do such as visit the Old Citadel on Marion Square. Every week different cadet companies compete in intramural sports. Daes Hall has a gym and various places for physical activity such as racquetball courts and basketball courts.",
            "The meals aren't the best when it comes to quality, but you will get the nutrition necessary when you need to fuel your body for the rigorous physical activity you go through as a cadet.",
            "You live in barracks just as you would in the real military. You share a room with a fellow cadet of the same academic year and they are constantly being maintained by maintenance workers to make sure conditions exceed acceptability. The rooms also stay clean with Morning Room Inspections or Saturday Morning Inspections conducted by TAC Officers that are retired military officers. These inspections make sure the rooms are being taken care of by the cadets that live in them.",
            "This school has a wide array of majors to choose from, each presenting its own challenges and benefits along the way.",
            "If you decide to come to this institution, you will learn as you progress through your career as a Citadel cadet why it is the most important decision that you ever made; you just have to find the strength within yourself to stay strong and be resilient going through your freshman year as a knob.",
            "A school that upholds tradition in ways such as all cadets must uphold the Honor Code, A cadet does not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate those who do. All cadets are trained during their freshman year as knobs who learn to live by the core values of honor, duty, and respect. No one person knows why they choose to come to live the life they go through when going through knob year, and maintaining that discipline until they graduate, but they all learn it as they go: the fact that this institution molds you into a principled leader that this world needs more and more."
