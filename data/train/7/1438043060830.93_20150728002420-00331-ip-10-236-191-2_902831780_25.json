    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here I enjoy being here because it is right in the city, also the programs that are provided here for such an affordable price are excellent such like the Pre-law program in which I am involved in where they have a pre-law boot camp for freshmans and sophmores this summer to help prepare me and my peers for law school. I also enjoy being here because John Jay have a variety of students from different backgrounds who attend here. There are also a variety of clubs and activities to get involved in. Th school size is just right, not too big to get lost in, or too small. There are lounges which one may watch t.v., mingle, and use the computers provided. Am learning a lot I learn a lot from this school because the professors are willing to help if you ask. We also are given a lot of readings and if that is not done, the professors provide class discussions to encourage me and my fellow classmates to learn.
