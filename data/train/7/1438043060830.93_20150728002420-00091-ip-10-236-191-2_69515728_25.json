The FILESIZE parameter has a maximum value equal to the maximum value that can be stored in 64 bits. Note: If the space requirements of your export file exceed the available disk space, Export will terminate, and you will have to repeat the Export after making sufficient disk space available. When the amount of data Export must write exceeds the maximum value you specified for FILESIZE, it will get the name of the next export file from the FILE parameter (see FILE for more information) or, if it has used all the names specified in the FILE parameter, it will prompt you to provide a new export filename. If you do not specify a value for FILESIZE (note that a value of 0 is equivalent to not specifying FILESIZE), then Export will write to only one file, regardless of the number of files specified in the FILE parameter.
