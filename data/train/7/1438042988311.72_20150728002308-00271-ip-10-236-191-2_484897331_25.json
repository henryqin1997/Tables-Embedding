With a plurality of information recording faces, however, distances from the surface on a light source side of the information recording medium to respective information recording faces thereof are different from each other, and therefore, focusing of a laser light on the respective information recording faces through a single objective lens causes spherical aberration due to the difference in distance from the light source side surface to the respective information recording faces of the information recording medium. This makes it difficult to focus the laser light appropriately on the information recording faces. In view of the above problem, for example, Patent Document 1 (Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Publication No. 2006-31901) discloses that the angle of divergence of light incident to the objective lens is changed by driving a beam expander lens, a collimator lens, or the like in the direction of the optical axis to correct the spherical aberration caused due to the difference in distance from the light source side surface to the respective information recording faces of the information recording medium.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The present invention is not limited to the above described embodiment and can be put into practice in various forms without departing from the significant feature and/or the sprits thereof. Hence, the above embodiment is a mere example in every aspect and should not be construed limitedly. The scope of the present invention is defined in the appended claims and is not restricted by the description. Further, any modifications and alternations belonging to the equivalent range of the scope of the claims fall within the scope of the present invention. The optical pickup in accordance with the present invention can focus the laser light favorably to the respective plural information recording faces and is therefore useful in, for example, information systems, such as computers, video equipment, audio equipment, and the like which perform recording and replaying of data recorded in various kinds of information recording media, such as a CD (Compact Disc), a DVD (Digital Versatile Disc), a BD (Blu-ray Disc), an EVD (Enhanced Versatile Disc), a HD-DVD (High Definition Digital Versatile Disc), and the like. 16.5 0.007 204 100 5.1 0.002 647 86 11 \u22120.005 \u2212305 67 17.4 \u22120.007 \u2212190 59.5",
