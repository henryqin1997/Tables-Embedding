Pertussis toxin (0.25 ml, 250ng, Sigma) is injected intravenously, immediately after and 48 hr later. Mice are examined daily from day 10 post induction for clinical signs of EAE which were scored on a 0-5 scale as described in Lando et al., 123 J. IMMUNOL. 2156 (1979).}",

The resulting solution of poly[L-Ala,L-Tyr,L-Lys] is ultrafiltered through polyethersulphone membranes with a cut off of 5000 daltons until two thirds of the original volume were removed. The original volume is restored by addition of fresh deionized water. The process is repeated 5 times, until the impurity content is less than 1% (by HPLC). The resulting solution (at full volume) is acidified to pH 4.4 with acetic acid. The solution is ultrafiltered to pH 5.5-6 and the volume is reduced to one third. The resulting solution is lyophilized to dryness., 97456=A 2 L Erlenmeyer equipped with a magnetic stirrer, is charged with a piperidine (150 ml), deionized water (1400 ml), and poly[L-Glu,L-Tyr,N6-TFA-L-Lys] (50 g) and is stirred at 20-25\ufffd C. for 24 hours. The resulting solution of poly[L-Glu, L-Tyr, L-Lys] is ultrafiltered through polyethersulphone membranes with a cut off of 5000 daltons until two thirds of the original volume were removed. The original volume is restored by addition of fresh deionized water. The process is repeated 5 times, until the impurity content is less than 1% (by HPLC). The resulting solution (at full volume) is acidified to pH 4.2 with acetic acid. The solution is ultrafiltered to a pH of 5.5-6 and the volume is reduced to one third.

The collagen type CII peptide 261-273, has SEQ ID NO: 3 (AGFKGEQGPKGEP) and a molecular weight of 1516. The concentration of DR employed is 0.15 \u03bcM.

EAE is induced two days after the last feeding by injection of 25 \u03bcg guinea pig MBP emulsified in 1:1 CFA containing 4 mg/ml mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Ra) (Difco Lab, Detroit, Mich.). A total volume of 0.1 ml is injected into each of two hindfoot pads.
