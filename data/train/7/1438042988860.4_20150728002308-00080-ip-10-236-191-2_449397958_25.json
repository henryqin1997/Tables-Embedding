            "MOISTURE CONTROL CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING THE SAME - Provide is a moisture control constructional material which has improved moisture control performance and strength and which is easily produced, and a method for producing the same. The moisture control construction material is produced by forming a raw material that contains aluminum hydroxide and talc, and firing the formed raw material at 700\u00b0 C. to 1100\u00b0 C. The raw material contains 20% to 95% by weight aluminum hydroxide and 5% to 80% by weight of the talc-like material. The raw material may further contain at least one of clay and bentonite and/or montmorillonite.",
