            "But the Royals' bats do so more quietly. The bullpen, on the other hand, has some fireworks. Paging Kyle Farnsworth... Okay, okay, I won't dig on the Royals anymore. (Steph Bee)",
            "According to WXRL, the 1999 Royals had the worst bullpen in modern history. The 2010 Royals have gotten an excellent jump on their record today, and they haven't even used Kyle Farnsworth yet. (Steven Goldman)",
            "If anyone can make it close again, it's Dotel. 12 homers in 66.1 innings - Shef's only better shot at getting 500 today would be if Kyle Farnsworth were to somehow don a Sox uniform. (Jay Jaffe)"

    "textBeforeTable": "BP Roundtables Who made that argument? I just said I wouldn't waste money on guys like Farnsworth or Fuentes, nor would I overpay for Rodriguez. Look at the Rays pen. The Phillies. Heck, outside of Papelbon, it's not exactly a distinguished crew in Boston. The closer doesn't matter if you can't get to him. (Will Carroll) Here's the problem with the argument that you take flyers on kids and \"guys\" in the bullpen: the Mets did precisely that this year (besides Wagner), and it cost them a playoff berth. I understand not overpaying for the next Kyle Farnsworth, but all the Flushing Faithful will not miss Luis Ayala's corpse. (Razz from New York, NY) 2008-10-17 13:00:00\u00a0(link to chat) You left out spending $1.8 million on Horacio Ramirez (IIRC). I like the Crisp move as a win-now kind of transaction, but I savaged the Jacobs move for cause--some might think he's a win-now pickup, but he's just a placeholder, and Farnsworth and Ramirez are even less. This isn't progress, it's cosmetics, and like anything hastily slapped together, it'll melt in the summer sun. (Christina Kahrl) It appears to me that Dayton Moore in essence swapped",
