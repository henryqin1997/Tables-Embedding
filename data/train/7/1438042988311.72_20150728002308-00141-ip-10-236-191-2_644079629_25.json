CROIX COUNTY. 1849 SENCES OF THE TERRITORY OF MINNESOTA The 1849 Minnesota Territorial 'Sences' On 3 March 1849, the U.S. Congress formally approved the Minnesota Territory. Extending from the new state of Wisconsin on the east to the Missouri River on the west, the immense area opened to white settlement, displacing the Dakota and Ojibwe Indians. Among the first acts of the Territorial Legislature was authorization for a census. In honor of the sesquicentennial for Minnesota Territory, that census is given below, reprinted from the Minnesota Genealogical Journal. The original manuscripts are held in the State Archives at the Minnesota Historical Society, with multiple copies extant for some of the precincts. Those names are shown in the first column, with multiple names where it differed on the multiple copies. The census was also published in proceedings of the Territorial Legislature, and given in the 'comments' column. The published list has been reprinted and indexed, with the original extraction differences. Family historians are often counseled to always go back to the original, because of the possibility of transcription errors. This shows that even when you do, you might find variant spellings! your specialists in genealogy and local history for Minnesota and the surrounding area from Park Genealogical Books, Research Notes JUNE 11 1849",
