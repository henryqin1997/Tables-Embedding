There are a limited amount of scholarships available early on that you can receive if you apply before January of the year you plan to attend., 649479=Beautiful campus, super excited to move back in June., 325917=The greek life is expanding in the fall of 2013 there will be 7 national sororities and 1 local sorority and there are 15 national fraternities. The community is getting unusually strict though and is no longer allowed to be called Greek there., 164301=The clubs abound here at MSU. If there isn't a club that you wish to join, and you and four of your friends have an idea for a club, you can just march on down to the Office of Student Engagement and start your own club! We have everything from Academic clubs, to Spectrum, the LGBTQ club. There are tons of activities like trips and exercise classes, and we're even finishing up our recreation center which will house a pool, a rock wall, and I even hear a zip line is involved!, 169519=Apply soon! Many of the school scholarships are awarded by December. Be prepared to get involved, on campus and in the community. We're a Public Affairs University, so community service is a must for most, and campus life is purely a blast. You make friends through joining clubs and organizations, and we have a lot of them. Find your niche and jump right in!, 663875=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Come check out the campus and see if it is a place you can call home for awhile. Bang for the buck I am receiving the education I need for the future. The campus has a tram we can ride to downtown which saves gas money. Am enjoying being here There are lots of things to do on campus and around town. Am learning a lot I have learned a lot about my physical body and nutrition in our PE Class and about the world economy in my Economics class. Textiles has been interesting to see the different kinds of material that clothes can be made from. Art has been a learning process with the different mediums we used this sememster.
