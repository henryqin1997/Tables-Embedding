            "This feature allows applications to discover the existence, location, and configuration of networked resources within networks, and provides a timely and reliable awareness of the services within networks, as applications advertise and discover services on networks. This feature was introduced in Cisco IOS Release 15.0M. In Cisco IOS XE Release 2.5, this feature was introduced on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers. The following commands were introduced in this feature: authentication (service-family) bandwidth-percent clear eigrp service-family dampening-change dampening-interval default external-client default (SAF) debug eigrp service-family default-metric (EIGRP) eigrp stub (service-family) exit-service-family exit-sf-interface exit-sf-topology external-client keepalive (SAF) maximum-service (EIGRP) neighbors (service-family) password (SAF) service-family service-family external-client listen sf-interface show eigrp service-family show eigrp service-family ipv4 topology show eigrp service-family ipv6 topology show eigrp tech-support shutdown topology username (SAF)",
