For general information about DTD files and XML, see the XML specification at http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml. To check the correctness of these deployment descriptors prior to deployment, see The Deployment Descriptor Verifier. Do not edit the DTD files; their contents change only with new versions of the Application Server. Note \u2013 Each deployment descriptor (or XML) file has a corresponding DTD file, which defines the elements, data, and attributes that the deployment descriptor file can contain. For example, the sun-application_1_4-0.dtd file defines the structure of the sun-application.xml file. The DTD files for the Application Server deployment descriptors are located in the install-dir/lib/dtds directory. Settings in the Application Server deployment descriptors override corresponding settings in the Java EE deployment descriptors and in the Application Server's domain.xml file unless otherwise stated. For more information about the domain.xml file, see the Sun Java System Application Server Enterprise Edition 8.2 Administration Reference. Note \u2013 Sun Java System Application Server uses deployment descriptors in addition to the J2EE standard descriptors for configuring features specific to the Application Server. The sun-application.xml, sun-web.xml, and sun-cmp-mappings.xml files are optional; all the others are required. Sun Java System Application Server Descriptors Alphabetical Listing of All Elements",
