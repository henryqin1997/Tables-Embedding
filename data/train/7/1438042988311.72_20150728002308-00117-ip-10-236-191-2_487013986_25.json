    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{32380=In order to accommodate a wide range of printing parameters and printing/RF equipment, the RF-activatable inks may be formulated to have a wide range of dielectric loss values at selected frequencies. For example, in some embodiments the inkjet inks will have dielectric loss (e\u2033) values of about 1000 to about 20,000 at a frequency of 30 MHz. This includes embodiments wherein the inkjet inks have e\u2033 values of about 1000 to about 5000 (e.g., about 1500 to about 3000), further includes inkjet inks that have e\u2033 values of about 5000 to about 10,000 (e.g., about 6000 to about 8000) and still further includes inkjet inks that have e\u2033 values of about 10,000 to about 20,000 (e.g., about 12,000 to about 18,000), measured at a frequency of 30 MHz. In some embodiments the inkjet inks will have e\u2033 values of about 200 to about 5000 at 60 MHz. This includes inkjet inks that have e\u2033 values of about 200 to about 1000 (e.g., about 300 to 500), further includes inkjet inks that have e\u2033 values of about 1000 to about 3000 (e.g., about 1500 to 2500), and still further includes inkjet inks that have e\u2033 values of about 3000 to about 5000 (e.g., about 3500 to about 4500), measured at a frequency of 60 MHz. It should be understood, however, that the RF-activatable inks provided herein are not limited to those having these particular RF-susceptibility profiles., 22347=This application is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/260,779, filed Oct. 27, 2005, which in turn claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/522,721, filed Nov. 1, 2004, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/680,256, filed May 12, 2005, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference for any and all purposes., 59217=The radiofrequency field to which the inks are exposed are generated from RF power sources in the range from about 1 to 1000 W for home and office printers. However, a higher power may be desirable for industrial printing devices. Thus, in some embodiments the ink compositions are exposed to radiofrequency fields with a power of about 50 to 5000 W. This includes embodiments where the ink compositions are exposed to radiofrequency fields with a power of about 50 to 4000 W., 55243=The inkjet inks are generally characterized by high ionic conductivities and radiofrequency energy susceptibilities. Ionic conductivity is not the same as electric conductivity as highly ionic conductive materials may be substantially electrical insulators. One measure of radiofrequency susceptibility is the dielectric loss factor (e\u2033) otherwise known in the art as the imaginary portion of the relative permittivity. In contrast, the real portion of the relative permittivity of a material is known as the dielectric constant. For some of the inkjet inks provided herein the dielectric loss factor is at least about 15. This includes embodiments where the dielectric loss factor at a frequency of 30 MHz is at least about 15, further includes embodiments where the dielectric loss factor at a frequency of 30 MHz is at least about 100, still further includes embodiments where the dielectric loss factor at a frequency of 30 MHz is at least about 1000, even further includes embodiments where the dielectric loss factor at a frequency of 30 MHz is at least about 10,000., 42489=A variety of radiofrequency-activatable ionomers may be used in the RF inkjet ink compositions. Examples of such ionomers are described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6,348,679. One specific class of ionomers that may be used in the RF inkjet ink compositions is acrylic acid polymers and copolymers. The copolymers are polymerized from at least one of an acrylic acid or methacrylic acid monomer and at least one additional monomer such as a vinyl aromatic monomer (e.g., styrene) or ethylene. Specific examples of such copolymers include, but are not limited to, styrene-acrylic copolymers and salts thereof, ethylene-acrylic copolymers and salts thereof and vinylacetate-acrylic copolymers and salts thereof. The acrylic acid copolymers may be made using well-known polymerization techniques, including batch, continuous and semi-continuous polymerizations. In addition, suitable acrylic polymer are commercially available. One example of a commercially available styrene-acrylic copolymer is JONCRYL\u2122 682, available from Johnson Polymer, Sturtevant, Wis. From these polymers and copolymers, ionomers may be obtained by neutralization with a suitable base. In some embodiments acrylic acid polymers or copolymers have acid numbers in the range 35 to 350 mg of KOH/g and weight-average molecular weight in the range 1500 to 50,000. Suitable bases include, but are not limited to, KOH, LiOH, NaOH, Mg(OH)2, Ca(OH)2 and amines, including ammonia., 45108=Sulfonated polymers are another class of ionomers that may be used in the RF inkjet ink compositions. This class includes sulfonated polyesters, copolymers and salts thereof. Also included in this group are sulfonated polystyrenes, acrylamidopropane sulfonate based polymers and urethane ionomers polymerized from a diisocyanate diol with a sulfonate functionality. More information, including specific examples of each of the above-referenced types of ionomers, may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,348,679, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Suitable sulfonated polyesters and copolymers thereof are also described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,750,605; 5,552,495; 5,543,488; 5,527,655; 5,523,344; 5,281,630; 4,598,142; 4,037,777; 3,033,827; 3,033,826; 3,033,822; 3,075,952; 2,901,466; 2,465,319; 5,098,962; 4,990,593; 4,973,656; 4,910,292; 4,525,524; 4,408,532; 4,304,900; 4,257,928; 4,233,196; 4,110,284; 4,052,368; 3,879,450; and 3,018,272; the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Some sulfonated polyesters may be purchased commercially. Commercially available sulfonated polyesters are sold by Eastman Chemical Company, Kingsport, Tenn., under nos. AQ1045, AQ1350, AQ1950, AQ14000, AQ35S, AQ38S, AQ55S and EASTEK\u2122 1300., 50776=The colorants used in the RF inkjet ink compositions may be pigments, dyes or a combination of one or more pigments and/or dyes. Suitable colorants include, but are not limited to, cyan, yellow, magenta and black colorants. The amount of pigment or dye in a given inkjet ink formulation will depend on the desired color and intensity of the ink. However, in some illustrative embodiments the RF inkjet ink compositions will contain about 0.1 to 10 wt. % colorant based on the total weight of the ink composition. This includes embodiments where the RF inkjet ink compositions include about 1 to 8 wt. % and further includes embodiments where the RF inkjet ink compositions include about 2 to 6 wt. % colorant based on the total weight of the RF inkjet ink compositions. Examples of suitable pigments and dyes for use in the present ink formulations may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,866,378, and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,814,138, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
