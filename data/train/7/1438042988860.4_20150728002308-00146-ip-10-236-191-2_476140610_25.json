    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{55656=Matteson D S Chem. Rev. 89: 1535-1551, 1989 reviews the use of \u03b1-halo boronic esters as intermediates for the synthesis of inter alia amino boronic acids and their derivatives. Matteson describes the use of pinacol boronic esters in non-chiral synthesis and the use of pinanediol boronic esters for chiral control, including in the synthesis of amino and amido boronate esters., 48383=In describing inhibitors or substrates of proteases, P1, P2, P3, etc. designate substrate or inhibitor residues which are amino-terminal to the scissile peptide bond, and S1, S2, S3, etc., designate the corresponding subsites of the cognate protease in accordance with: Schechter, I. and Berger, A. On the Size of the Active Site in Proteases, Biochem.Biophys.Res.Comm., 27:157-162, 1967. In thrombin, the S1 binding site or \u201cspecificity pocket\u201d is a well defined slit in the enzyme, whilst the S2 and S3 binding subsites (also respectively called the proximal and distal hydrophobic pockets) are hydrophobic and interact strongly with, respectively, Pro and (R)\u2014Phe, amongst others., 56073=Contreras et al J. Organomet. Chem. 246: 213-217, 1983 describe how intramolecular N\u2192B coordination was demonstrated by spectroscopic studies on cyclic boronic esters prepared by reacting Me2CHCMe2\u2014BH2 with diethanolamines., 137081=One example of a divalent metal is calcium. Another suitable divalent metal is magnesium. Also contemplated is zinc. The divalent metals are usually used in a boronic acid:metal ratio of substantially 2:1, in order to achieve the preferred monovalent boronate moiety. Salts containing mixtures of divalent metals, e.g. mixtures of alkaline earth metals, are also contemplated., 162014=In one method, the products of the disclosure are used for the treatment of patients by haemodialysis, by providing the product in the dialysis solution, as described in relation to other thrombin inhibitors in WO 00/41715. The disclosure therefore includes dialysing solutions and dialysing concentrates which comprise a product of the disclosure, as well as a method of treatment by dialysis of a patient in need of such treatment, which method comprises the use of a dialysing solution including a low molecular weight thrombin inhibitor. Also included is the use of an anti-thrombotic product of the disclosure for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment by dialysis of a patient, in which the anti-thrombotic product of the disclosure is provided in the. dialysing solution., 276161=The reader is referred to Dixon, M and Webb, E.C., \u201cEnzymes\u201d. third edition, 1979, Academic Press, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, for a further description of the measurement of Ki., 56369=Boronic acid and ester compounds have displayed promise as inhibitors of the proteasome, a multicatalytic protease responsible for the majority of intracellular protein turnover. Ciechanover, Cell, 79:13-21, 1994, teaches that the proteasome is the proteolytic component of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, in which proteins are targeted for degradation by conjugation to multiple molecules of ubiquitin. Ciechanover also teaches that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a key role in a variety of important physiological processes., 162836=In another method, the products of the disclosure are used to combat undesirable cell proliferation, as described in relation to other thrombin inhibitors in WO 01/41796. The undesirable cell proliferation is typically undesirable hyperplastic cell proliferation, for example proliferation of smooth muscle cells, especially vascular smooth muscle cells. The products of the disclosure particularly find application in the treatment of intimal hyperplasia, one component of which is proliferation of smooth muscle cells. Restenosis can be considered to be due to neointimal hyperplasia; accordingly intimal hyperplasia in the context of the disclosure includes restenosis., 187542=The synthesis of boropeptides, including, for example, Cbz\u2014D\u2014Phe\u2014Pro\u2014BoroMpg\u2014OPinacol is familiar to those skilled in the art and described in the prior art mentioned above, including Claeson et al (U.S. Pat. No. 5,574,014 and others) and Kakkar et al (WO 92/07869 and family members including U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,338). It is described also by Elgendy et al Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. (USA) 340:173-178, 1993; Claeson,G. et al Biochem.J. 290:309-312, 1993; Deadman et al J. Enzyme Inhibition 9:29-41, 1995, and by Deadman et al J. Med. Chem. 38:1511-1522, 1995., 58654=Wu et al, J. Pharm. Sci., 89:758-765, 2000, discuss the stability of the compound N-(2-pyrazine) carbonyl-phenylalanine-leucine boronic acid (LDP-341, also known as bortezomib), an anti-cancer agent. It is described how \u201cduring an effort to formulate [LDP-341] for parenteral administration, the compound showed erratic stability behaviour\u201d. The degradation pathways were investigated and it was concluded that the degradation was oxidative, the initial oxidation being attributed to peroxides or molecular oxygen and its radicals., 340870=The aim of the study was to compare the bleeding times of heparin with TRI 50b in a suitable model. It is accepted that heparin is a poor inhibitor of platelet procoagulant activity (J. Biol. Chem. Oct. 10, 1978; 253(19):6908-16; Miletich J P, Jackson C M, Majerus PW1: J. Clin. Invest. 1983 May; 71(5):1383-91)., 51546=The replacement of the P2 Pro residue of borotripeptide thrombin inhibitors by an N-substituted glycine is described in Fevig J M et al Bioorg. Med. Chem. 8: 301-306 and Rupin A et al Thromb. Haemost. 78(4): 1221-1227, 1997. See also U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,360 (de Nanteuil et al)., 271992=TRI 50c calcium salt was assayed as an inhibitor of human \u03b1-thrombin by an amidolytic assay (J. Deadman et al, J. Med. Chem. 38:15111-1522, 1995, which reports a Ki value of 7 nM for TRI 50b)., 351171=These were dosed in a formulation prepared as follows: 48 mg/ml of TRI 50b is dissolved in ethanol: PEG 300 (2:3 vol: vol). Just before administration, 5 volumes of this solution is mixed with 3 volumes of 5% kollidon 17 8F., 269411=This foam was redissolved in 100 ml acetone, filtered and added dropwise to an ice cooled solution of 1100 ml petrol ether 40/60 and 1100 ml diethylether. The resulting colourless precipitate was filtered, washed two times with petrol ether 40/60 and dried under high vacuum, yielding 49.48 g of a colourless solid (92%), with a purity of 99.4% according to an HPLC measurement., 154827=The disclosure therefore includes amines other than aminosugars which have one or more (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6) polar substituents, especially hydroxy, in addition to one amine group. Such compounds may have a ratio of (amino plus hydroxy groups):carbon atoms of 1:2 to 1:1, the latter ratio being particularly preferred., 327182=Washed platelets were treated with either 1.15 nM thrombin, 23 \u03bcg/ml collagen or a mixture of both at the same concentration at 37\ufffd C. TRI 50b was added either for 1 minute prior to the addition of activator or immediately after the incubation with activator. Platelet procoagulant activity was determined as described previously (Goodwin C A et al, Biochem J. 1995 8, 308: 15-21). TRI 50b proved to be a potent inhibitor of platelet procoagulant activity with IC50's as summarised below:, 55534=Peptide boronic acid inhibitors of hepatic C virus protease are described in WO 01/02424., 58346=It is known that derivatisation of boronic acids as cyclic esters provides oxidation resistance. For example, Martichonok V et al J. Am. Chem. Soc. 118: 950-958, 1996 state that diethanolamine derivatisation provides protection against possible boronic acid oxidation., 272224=The inhibition of human \u03b1-thrombin therefore, was determined by the inhibition of the enzyme catalysed hydrolysis of three different concentrations of the chromogenic substrate S-2238., 248643=FTIR (KBr disc) \u03bdmax (cm\u22121) 3291.1, 3062.7, 3031.1, 2932.9, 2875.7, 2346.0, 1956.2, 1711.8, 1647.6, 1536.0, 1498.2, 1452.1, 1392.4, 1343.1, 1253.8, 1116.8, 1084.3, 1027.7, 916.0, 887.6, 748.6, 699.4, 595.5, 506.5., 248093=1H NMR 400 MHz, \u03b4H(CD3OD) 7.23-7.33 (20H, m, ArH), 5.14 (4H, m, PhCH2O), 4.52 (4H, m, \u03b1CH), 3.65 (2H, m), 3.31 (12H, m), 3.23 (6H, s, OCH3), 2.96 (4H, d, J7.8 Hz), 2.78 (2H, m), 2.58 (2H, m), 1.86 (6H, m), 1.40 (10H, m)., 57986=Unfortunately, organoboronic acids can be relatively difficult to obtain in analytically pure form. Thus, alkylboronic acids and their boroxines are often air-sensitive. Korcek et al, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 2:242, 1972, teaches that butylboronic acid is readily oxidized by air to generate 1-butanol and boric acid., 47491=It has been known for some years that boronic acid compounds and their derivatives, e.g. esters, have biological activities, notably as inhibitors or substrates of proteases. For example, Koehler et al. Biochemistry 10:2477, 1971 report that 2-phenylethane boronic acid inhibits the serine protease chymotrypsin at millimolar levels. The inhibition of chymotrypsin and subtilisin by arylboronic acids (phenylboronic acid, m-nitro-phenylboronic acid, m-aminophenylboronic acid, m-bromophenylboronic acid) is reported by Phillip et al, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 68:478-480, 1971. A study of the inhibition of subtilisin Carlsberg by a variety of boronic acids, especially phenyl boronic acids substituted by Cl, Br, CH3, H2N, MeO and others, is described by Seufer-Wasserthal et al, Biorg. Med. Chem. 2(1):35-48, 1994., 188165=Stereoselective synthesis with S or R configuration at the chiral B-terminal carbon may be conducted using established methodology (Elgendy et al Tetrahedron. Lett. 33:4209-4212, 1992; WO 92/07869 and family members including U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,338) using (+) or (\u2212)-pinanediol as the chiral director (Matteson et al J. Am. Chem. Soc. 108:810-819, 1986; Matteson et al Organometallics. 3:1284-1288, 1984). Another approach is to resolve the requisite aminoboronate intermediate (e.g. Mpg-BOPinacol) to selectively obtain the desired (R)-isomer and couple it to the dipeptide moiety (e.g. Cbz-(R)-Phe-(S)-Pro, which is the same as Cbz-D-Phe-L-Pro) which will form the remainder of the molecule., 66511=Proteases are enzymes which cleave proteins at specific peptide bonds. Cuypers et al., J. Biol. Chem. 257:7086, 1982, and the references cited therein, classify proteases on a mechanistic basis into five classes: serine, cysteinyl or thiol, acid or aspartyl, threonine and metalloproteases. Members of each class catalyse the hydrolysis of peptide bonds by a similar mechanism, have similar active site amino acid residues and are susceptible to class-specific inhibitors. For example, all serine proteases that have been characterised have an active site serine residue., 64599=Hemostasis is the normal physiological condition of blood in which its components exist in dynamic equilibrium. When the equilibrium is disturbed, for instance following injury to a blood vessel, certain biochemical pathways are triggered leading, in this example, to arrest of bleeding via clot formation (coagulation). Coagulation is a dynamic and complex process in which proteolytic enzymes such as thrombin play a key role. Blood coagulation may occur through either of two cascades of zymogen activations, the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of the coagulation cascade. Factor VIIa in the extrinsic pathway, and Factor IXa in the intrinsic pathway are important determinants of the activation of factor X to factor Xa, which itself catalyzes the activation of prothrombin to thrombin, whilst thrombin in turn catalyses the polymerization of fibrinogen monomers to fibrin polymer. The last protease in each pathway is therefore thrombin, which acts to hydrolyze four small peptides (two FpA and two FpB) from each molecule of fibrinogen, thus deprotecting its polymerization sites. Once formed, the linear fibrin polymers may be cross-linked by factor XIIIa, which is itself activated by thrombin. In addition, thrombin is a potent activator of platelets, upon which it acts at specific receptors. Thrombin activation of platelets leads to aggregation of the cells and secretion of additional factors that further accelerate the creation of a hemostatic plug. Thrombin also potentiates its own production by the activation of factors V and VIII (see Hemker and Beguin in: Jolles, et. al., \u201cBiology and Pathology of Platelet Vessel Wall Interactions,\u201d pp. 219-26 (1986), Crawford and Scrutton in: Bloom and Thomas, \u201cHaemostasis and Thrombosis,\u201d pp. 47-77, (1987), Bevers, et. al., Eur. J. Biochem. 122:429-36, 1982, Mann, Trends Biochem. Sci. 12:229-33, 1987)., 309240=The zinc, calcium and magnesium salts have all been prepared with a stoichiometry of one metal ion to two molecules of TRI 50c. The values found for the calcium and magnesium salts are close to and thus consistent with those calculated for this 1:2 stoichiometry. For the zinc salt an excess of zinc was found; nonetheless, the zinc salt comprises a significant proportion of acid boronate. The sodium salt has been prepared with a stoichiometry of one metal ion to one molecule of TRI 50c. The value found for the sodium salt is close to and thus consistent with that calculated for this 1:1 stoichiometry., 51091=Metternich (EP 471651 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,288,707, the latter being assigned to Trigen Limited) discloses variants of Phe\u2014Pro\u2014BoroArg boropeptides in which the P3 Phe is replaced by an unnatural hydrophobic amino acid such as trimethylsilylalanine, p-tert.butyl-diphenyl-silyloxymethyl-phenylalanine or p-hydroxymethylphenylalanine and the P1 side chain may be neutral (alkoxyalkyl, alkylthioalkyl or trimethylsilylalkyl)., 272441=200 \u03bcl of sample or buffer and 50 \u03bcl of S-2238 were incubated at 37\ufffd C. for 1 minute and 50 \u03bcl of human \u03b1-thrombin (0.25 NIH\u03bc/ml) was added. The initial rate of inhibited and uninhibited reactions were recorded at 4.5 nm. The increase in optical density was plotted according to the method of Lineweaver and Burke. The Km and apparent Km were determined and Ki was calculated using the relationship., 277727=FTIR (KBr disc) \u03bdmax (cm\u22121) 3331.3, 3031.4, 2935.3, 2876.9, 2341.9, 1956.1, 1711.6, 1639.9, 1534.3, 1498.1, 1453.0, 1255.3, 1115.3, 1084.6, 1027.6, 917.3, 748.9, 699.6, 594.9, 504.5, 467.8., 277175=1H NMR 300 MHz, \u03b4H(CD3C(O)CD3) 7.14-7.22 (20H, m), 6.90 (2H, m), 4.89 (4H, m, PhCH2O, 4.38 (2H, m), 3.40 (2H, br s), 2.73-3.17 (20H, broad unresolved multiplets), 1.05-2.10 (16H, broad unresolved multiplets)., 133329=The disclosure includes salts of boronic acids (I) having an observed stoichiometry consistent with the salt being of (being representable by) the formula \u201c(boronate\u2212)n cationn+\u201d. One class of such salts are represented by the formula: [Cbz-(R)-Phe-(S)-Pro-(R)-Mpg-B(OH)(O\u2212)]M+ where M+ represents a monovalent cation, especially an alkali metal cation. It will be understood that the above representation is a notional representation of a product whose observed stoichiometry is unlikely to be literally and exactly 1:1. In any event, a particular salt is Cbz-(R)-Phe-(S)-Pro-(R)-Mpg-B(OH)2 monosodium salt (TGN 255). In the above formula, the trigonally-represented boronate represents, as always, boronates which are trigonal, tetrahedral or mixed trigonal/tetrahedral. Particularly exemplary are products which comprise:, 185047=Transdermal formulations may be prepared in the form of matrices or membranes, or as fluid or viscous formulations in oil or hydrogels or as a compressed powder pellet. For transdermal patches, an adhesive which is compatible with the skin may be included, such as polyacrylate, a silicone adhesive or polyisobutylene, as well as a foil made of, e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene vinylacetate, polyvinylchloride, polyvinylidene chloride or polyester, and a removable protective foil made from, e.g., polyester or paper coated with silicone or a fluoropolymer. For the preparation of transdermal solutions or gels, water or organic solvents or mixtures thereof may be used. Transdermal gels may furthermore contain one or more suitable gelling agents or thickeners such as silicone, tragacanth, starch or starch derivatives, cellulose or cellulose derivatives or polyacrylic acids or derivatives thereof. Transdermal formulations may also suitably contain one or more substances that enhance absorption though the skin, such as bile salts or derivatives thereof and/or phospholipids. Transdermal formulations may be prepared according to a method disclosed in, e.g., B W Barry, \u201cDermatological Formulations, Percutaneous Absorption\u201d, Marcel Dekker Inc., New York\u2014Basel, 1983, or Y W Chien, \u201cTransdermal Controlled Systemic Medications\u201d, Marcel Dekker Inc., New York--Basel, 1987., 147292=It is envisaged that a desirable class of amine includes those having polar functional groups in addition to a single amine group, as such compounds will be more hydrophilic and thus more soluble than others. In certain salts, the or each additional functional group is hydroxy. Some amines have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 additional functional groups, especially hydroxy groups. In one illustrative class of amines the ratio of (amino plus hydroxy groups):carbon atoms is from 1:2 to 1:1, the latter ratio being particularly preferred. These amines with one or more additional polar functional groups may be a hydrocarbon, especially an alkane, substituted by the amino group and the additional polar group(s). The amino group may be substituted or unsubstituted and, excluding amino substituents, the polar base may contain, for example, up to 10 carbon atoms; usually there are no less than three such carbon atoms, e.g. 4, 5 or 6. Aminosugars are included in this category of polar bases., 324992=Chromogenic substrate S2238 dissolved to 4 mM (25 mg+10 mI) in water. Diluted to 50 \u03bcM with assay buffer for use in assay at 5 \u03bcM. (S2238 is H-D-Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA)., 52748=Non-peptide boronates have been proposed as inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes in detergent compositions. WO 92/19707 and WO 95/12655 report that arylboronates can be used as inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes in detergent compositions. WO 92/19707 discloses compounds substituted meta to the boronate group by a hydrogen bonding group, especially acetamido (\u2014NHCOCH3), sufonamido (\u2014NHSO2CH3) and alkylamino. WO 95/12655 teaches that ortho-substituted compounds are superior., 119335=The disclosure therefore includes medicaments comprising salts, e.g. metal salts, of organoboronic acids which are thrombin inhibitors, particularly selective thrombin inhibitors, having a neutral P1 (S1-binding) moiety. For more information about moieties which bind to the S3, S2 and S1 sites of thrombin, see for example Tapparelli C et al, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 14: 366-376, 1993; Sanderson P et al, Current Medicinal Chemistry, 5: 289-304, 1998; Rewinkel 3 et al, Current Pharmaceutical Design, 5:1043-1075, 1999; and Coburn C Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 11(5): 721-738, 2001. The thrombin inhibitory salts of the disclosure are not limited to those having S3, S2 and S1 affinity groups described in the publications listed in the preceding sentence.}",
