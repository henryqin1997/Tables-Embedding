However, in the receive-only topology, the SCE 2000 is connected to the external switch rather than being directly connected to the FE link., 120605=Note that when the SCE 2000 is connected to the network through an external switch, a failure of the SCE 2000 does not affect the traffic flow, as the traffic continues to flow through the external switch., 399918=The procedures for managing SCE 2000 configurations are explained in the following sections:, 411463=After you have installed your SCE 2000 platform hardware, checked all external connections, turned on the system power, allowed the system to boot up, and performed the initial system configuration, you might need to perform more complex configurations, which are beyond the scope of this publication., 177047=Make sure that they are oriented so that both crossrails will support the SCE 2000 when they are attached to the rack., 114007=single SCE 2000 topology \u2014 Provides increased network capacity and the ability to process both directions of a bi-directional flow, processing both the upstream and downstream paths of a flow, even if they traverse different links, 43548=For initial installation and startup information, refer to the SCE 2000 4/8xFE Quick Start Guide., 396608=On the SCE 2000 Front panel, examine that the Status LED is flashing green., 141306=Single SCE 2000 inline installation = \u201cInline\u201d connection mode., 354054=For inline topologies, the SCE 2000 is directly connected to the two FE links, using the FE-1 and FE-2 ports as described above., 277522=The SCE 2000 passes Raw Data Records (RDRs) to an external collection system via the RDR-Formatter. In order for the data to reach the correct location, the IP address of the external collection system and its port number must be configured., 339251=If the management port Link LED on the SCE 2000 still does not light, verify that the cable is connected correctly to the appropriate network element on its second end., 164997=Allow at least 2 inches (5 cm) of clearance at its left and right sides for airflow clearance from the inlet and exhaust vents, and that no exhaust air from other equipment is drawn into the SCE 2000. For descriptions and illustrations regarding airflow, see Airflow., 136366=Refer to the following sections to determine the correct values for all topology-related parameters before beginning run the initial setup of the SCE 2000., 94782=The SCE 2000 platform back-panel contains the following components:, 183035=Before you connect the power or turn on the power to the SCE 2000 platform, it is required that you provide an adequate chassis ground (protective earth) connection for the SCE 2000 chassis. A grounding kit is provided with each SCE 2000., 95306=The rear panels of both the AC- and DC-powered SCE 2000 platforms are shown in the following pair of figures., 144629=Bypass \u2014 The external switch forwards traffic with no intervention of the control application running in the SCE 2000 platform, but monitoring functions continue uninterrupted., 389471=Check the following conditions before you start your SCE 2000 platform:, 216045=This completes the steps for reconnecting the AC-input power supply to the SCE 2000 platform., 363638=The Active LED (if flashing green) indicates that traffic is being received and/or transmitted by the SCE 2000., 84462=Table\u00a02.2.\u00a0SCE 2000 Ports, 99490=Six screws (Philips), 8-32 x 3/8\u201d (for attaching the brackets to the SCE 2000 chassis), 393126=It takes a several minutes for the SCE 2000 to boot and for the status LED to change from orange to flashing orange or flashing green., 153826=The environmental monitoring functionality in the SCE 2000 protects the system and components from potential damage from over-voltage and over-temperature conditions. To ensure normal operation and to avoid unnecessary maintenance, plan your site configuration and prepare your site before installation. After installation, make sure the site maintains an ambient temperature of 41\u00b0F to 104\u00b0F (5\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C) with short term temperatures ranging from 23\u00b0F to 131\u00b0F (\u20135\u00b0C to 55\u00b0C), and keep the area around the SCE 2000 chassis free from dust., 127254=In this topology, an external switch resides physically on the FE link between the subscribers and the network. The traffic passes through the external switch, which splits traffic to the SCE 2000. The SCE 2000, therefore, only receives traffic and does not transmit., 168426=View the bottom panel by lifting the SCE 2000, placing your hands around the SCE 2000 sides and lifting the SCE 2000 from underneath. To prevent injury, avoid sudden twists or moves., 140192=Inline \u2014 The SCE 2000 resides on the data link between the subscriber side and the network side, thus both receiving and transmitting packets.}",
