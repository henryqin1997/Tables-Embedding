Everything outside recognized tables is ignored. HTML format Different test data templates are available for HTML and TSV formats to make it easier to get started writing tests. Robot Framework test data is defined in tabular format, using either the hypertext markup language (HTML), tab-separated values (TSV), plain text, or reStructuredText (reST) formats. Robot Framework selects a parser for the test data based on the file extension. The extension is case-insensitive, and the recognized extensions are .html, .htm and .xhtml for HTML, .tsv for TSV, .txt for plain text, and .rst or .rest for reStructuredText. 2.1.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Supported file formats Variable files to provide more flexible ways to create variables than resource files. Resource files with variables and higher-level user keywords. Test libraries containing the lowest-level keywords. In addition to this, there are: Test suite directories can have a special initialization file. A test suite directory can also contain other test suite directories, and this hierarchical structure can be as deeply nested as needed.

There is also a tool called RIDE available that is designed for editing the test data. Encoding and entity references HTML entity references (for example, &auml;) are supported. Additionally, any encoding can be used, assuming that it is specified in the data file. Normal HTML files must use the META element as in the example below:  <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\"> XHTML files should use the XML preamble as in this example:  <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"Big5\"?> If no encoding is specified, Robot Framework uses ISO-8859-1 by default.
