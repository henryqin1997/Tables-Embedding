            "security does a really good job at fit. sometimes it's too good. just a forewarning, be mindful of where you park because they patrol with golf carts and are not afraid to write citations or get your car towed.",
            "greek life is not as celebrated here as maybe some other universities will. there is not frat or sorority row, but there some good fraternities that can really help you survive different courses by getting insight or material about classes that your brothers have taken. so it might actually open you up to good connections if you fell that you might need help.",
            "the have pretty decent chapters of honor societies that can really look good on resumes or just help you with introducing yourself to the field. during your freshman year, you have to take a university experience class that makes you join a club, but don't worry to much about that because it is not a bad way to go.",
            "those who find science and technology to be one of their passions.",
            "for some reason, the students organize these human versus zombies game like every fall that spreads out campus wide. it's crazy because even some professor's get involved so you will be walking to class and all of a sudden some people go running by and a professor bolts across campus with a nerf gun. i heard it can be real fun if you want to get into that.",
            "attending fit is a pretty pricey endeavor, but the cool thing is, they hand out so much scholarship! but just based off of the close professor interactions and the motto technology with a human touch, you really do get what your paying for.",
            "it is a small campus but thankfully the town is pretty big. not to mention, the beach is like 8 or so miles away! regardless, you always seem to find something to do which can really come in handy during the down times between classes.",
            "the food is excellent! the panther dining hall has some pretty gourmet selection for what you can find on a meal plan. also, other little places around like the sub and the ratskeller, more commonly called the rat, offer some pretty tasty alternatives as well.",
            "because its a small school, you get to know a lot more people than who is just on your floor or in your hall. there is wildlife hanging around most of the times and that can range from giant raccoons poking around outside to giant bugs that occasionally get inside. do not forget to bring a can of raid!",
            "make sure you keep up with the homework and attend lectures because it does help and attendance is taken for a lot of the classes. also, beware of all lab courses because regardless of the level, you have to write lab reports and not all of the ta's grade fairly.",
            "for those of you who are looking at colleges from a high school perspective, i recommend you take more advanced ap classes like ap calculus, ap physics c and ap chemistry, and study hard for the exams. this is because if you get an ap score of 4 or more in any of those, you have the potential of moving on and away from the general education classes much faster.",
            "fit is an excellent school for future scientists, mathematicians and engineers! this school opens your doors to a world of possibilities and guarantees you a bright future by introducing you to undergraduate research, internships, co-ops and more. i would say that as a physics major with ivy league plans for graduate school, i made the right choice!"

You can go shopping, see a movie, go out to eat, play a sport, walk around downtown....If ever you feel like you want to go for a drive, you can drive to Cocoa, Orlando, Viera, Rockledge, or another nearby place. There's this little place between Melbourne and Orlando called Harmony, and I know at some point (I think maybe January or February) they have this festival (Dark Sky Festival) where all the lights go out and telescopes are set up in a clear spot near some horse stables....communal star-gazing. It's really quite wonderful. :) Personally, I just hang out with my friends. The majority of your fun isn't something you have to find. It's right in front of you, in the people you love and in yourself., 37931=They have rolling admission, but if you get everything in by early January then you get priority consideration for scholarships (check fit.edu/e-mail the admissions department or your admissions counselor for the dates for the year you're applying). You'll also know the decision in some cases in just a few weeks! Same goes for the FAFSA, file early and you'll get priority and also in the past there have been early filer grants where if you file your FAFSA before a certain date you'll get another 1,000 for that year (not this year so they may not be doing it again). ***If you visit and attend a campus tour, half-day, or full-day event, on campus then you get another $1,000 per year automatically if you attend! It's worth the visit - you can get into Florida early and go to Disney, see a game, explore Melbourne or the state, go to the beach, and get some more money for tuition!, 135129=Florida Tech is a campus that is busing with international flavor. I started as a freshman in 2010 studying aviation management / flight. Florida tech offers a very wide varieties of degrees to chose from. Sports and recreational activities are all over the campus. Although small there is always something to do on campus or within the town of Melbourne. Florida Tech is a bit on the pricey side of colleges on the coast but i am confident in what i'm paying for., 150143=Become friends with the RAs, the residence hall dorms are a lot larger than you think (except for Roberts Hall). Study math and grammar over the summer so you don't have to take the introductory classes. Join a sports team., 386278=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Whether you want to or not, you will learn a lot. So far I have only spent one semester at Florida Institute of Technology and my professors are very serious about teaching their students. They do what they can to help you succeed in the class, and as long as you put in some effort to look for help, you will receive it either from a classmate, the professor, or the Academic Support Center. for the most part, my classes are very enjoyable.
