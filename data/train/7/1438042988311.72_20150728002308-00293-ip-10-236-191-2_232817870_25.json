The determination/decision need not have been made at step 4 or 5 of the sequential evaluation (i.e., the denial could have been based on steps 1 or 2.) However, a subsequent determination at the DDS level may be a basis for screen-out only if it was issued under the CE/MER regulations (i.e., on or after August 1, 1991).

The notice will inform class members of their possible entitlement to a redetermination of their claims, and will further inform such individuals that they must return an enclosed pre-addressed and postage prepaid postcard or form, within 60 days of receipt of the notice, in the event that such redetermination is desired. Should individual notices be returned as undeliverable, SSA will attempt to obtain updated addresses by providing a computer tape to the State Department of Social Services or corresponding agency in each State within the Tenth Circuit for the sole purpose of obtaining addresses through a computerized match with public assistance, Food Stamp, and/or other relevant records. SSA's attempts to obtain updated addresses are subject to the requirements of the Privacy Act, as amended by the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 552a.

Should this review result in a finding that the previous denial/termination was improper and that the individual should have been found disabled, the claim of such individual will be reopened, with the individual's claim of entitlement to benefits being determined through the date of the new determination rendered. Upon such reopening, SSA shall attempt to obtain updated medical records, and the individual shall cooperate in this regard in accordance with the requirements of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1512-.1519p and 416.912-.919p., 156383=at the reconsideration level between October 17, 1984, and July 31, 1991, inclusive;, 124313=7.
