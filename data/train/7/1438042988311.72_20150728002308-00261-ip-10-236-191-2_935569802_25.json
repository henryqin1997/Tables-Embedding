    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{15812=Every year we institute changes based on the previous year survey. In 2005 NERSC took a number of actions in response to suggestions from the 2004 user survey., 16174=NERSC response: In early 2005 NERSC implemented two changes to the queueing policies on Seaborg:, 17423=User satisfaction with NERSC's available computing hardware increased by .24 points on the 2005 survey., 237464=NERSC response: The adverse effect of network latency on interactive remote visualization is a well-known phenomenon. While we can't do anything about reducing network latency, we are evaluating use of an emerging technology for remote desktop sharing (a la \"VNC\") that will provide some help as it eliminates most of the round-trip Xlib protocol traffic between NERSC and the remote site; such round-trip Xlib traffic significantly contributes to usability and performance issues - the new solution does not eliminate it completely but should result in a noticeable performance improvement. We will post more information when it becomes available later in 2006., 183516=NERSC response: NERSC has made several changes based on the over allocation that occurred in 2005 and the resulting long turnaround times:, 2435=For questions that spanned the 2004 and 2005 surveys the change in rating was tested for significance (using the t test at the 90% confidence level). Significant increases in satisfaction are shown in blue; significant decreases in satisfaction are shown in red., 233155=NERSC response: The Center has future plans to upgrade DaVinci in the 2007 time frame in terms of both processor count as well as the addition of graphics hardware., 305681=My major complaint of the past year was the time spent waiting in batch queues on Seaborg. The introduction of Jacquard has helped this somewhat, though queue times are occasionally still long (one week for 1000 processors). I certainly appreciate being given \"boosts\", when circumstances demand it. However, relying on this a lot slows things down for users who are in a more ordinary mode of operation. Short of additional systems capacity, I'm not certain of the best solution..., 217364=NERSC response: The kernel bug that affected CAM was fixed on Jacquard on Dec 13, 2005. You should now be able to run CAM on Jacquard., 321281=- I would like to see the return of production accounts. We continue to have trouble with running large scale production by multiple individuals. We run into obvious problems like file-permissions. These can be solved by users being diligent about them when creating directories, but it doesn't solve the fact that some programs that do not honor the set umask when creating files - these have to all be set by hand at a later stage (they create files using 0644 mask instead of the more permissive 0666). Other more problematic issues are: job control for long running jobs (user may not be available and someone else should take control over the production) and ensuring a common environment to make sure that all processing is done in the same way (it turns out that many of the people running our production are also developers and may accidentally run the production using their developer environment, instead of the production env). Another issue that we continue to run against is the maximum number of simultaneous connections that HPSS allows. On a distributed computing system like PDSF, one needs the ability to open many simultaneous connections in order to extract the data from HPSS to the local machine. The HPSS group set a limit (I think 15) for the number of connections that any user can have, but are willing to increase that limit on an individual basis. We would like to see our production account to have this higher limit. It would ensure that normal users would not be able to abuse the HPSS system, yet allow our production to function properly. Production account issues were discussed extensively in April/May and we had a viable solution that would fulfill the DOE mandate of needing to track users. (the solution involved having production accounts that are not accessible from outside of NERSC, the user would always have to log into a system at NERSC as himself and only then ssh/su to the production account, allowing full tracking of who-did-what-at-what time). I am disappointed that this system has not yet been implemented, it would solve quite a few problems/annoyances we have at the moment when running large scale production., 219599=Debugging is still a daunting task on Seaborg. I avoid doing it and, thus far, have not faced a situation where I have needed to do anything complicated (fingers crossed for the future!). GUI interfaces are frustrating for remote users; debugging with large numbers of processors is always awkward and frustrating within a batch environment. This is not a NERSC-specific issue. However, some innovation on this problem would be welcome. I rue the day when I find myself with a code that runs just fine on 1000 processors, but fails on 2000! ..., 17009=NERSC response: In August 2005 NERSC deployed Jacquard, a Linux cluster with 640 2.2 Ghz Opteron CPUs available for computations and a theoretical peak computational performance of 2.8 Teraflops. This was followed in January 2006 wil Bassi, an IBM Power5 system with 888 processors available for computations and a theoretical peak computational performance of 6.7 Teraflops., 16684=User satisfaction with Seaborg's batch queue structure increased by .39 points on the 2005 survey., 182990=My primary issue with seaborg is that batch wait times can vary wildly with little notice (for example: in October 2005, a \"reg_1\" queue turnaround time of overnight abruptly increased to more than a week, and even \"premium\" jobs were subject to waits of more than two days). I am not certain if this is an unavoidable issue with shared supercomputer resources, but is it possible to provide some warning of batch wait times to be expected by a job? ..., 17765=NERSC response: During 2005 NERSC upgraded its network infrastructure to 10 gigabits per second. User satisfaction with network connectivity increased by .18 points on the 2005 survey., 309590=NERSC response: NERSC agrees that over allocation is not the right thing to do. Time has not been over allocated in 2006 and we did not pre-allocate time for the new Bassi Power5 system. NERSC is investigating with DOE options to under allocate resources in order to improve turnaround times while still meeting the DOE mission.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "You can see the 2005 User Survey text, in which users rated us on a 7-point satisfaction scale. Some areas were also rated on a 3-point importance scale or a 3-point usefulness scale. The survey responses provide feedback about every aspect of NERSC's operation, help us judge the quality of our services, give DOE information on how well NERSC is doing, and point us to areas we can improve. The survey results are listed below. Many thanks to the 201 users who responded to this year's User Survey.
