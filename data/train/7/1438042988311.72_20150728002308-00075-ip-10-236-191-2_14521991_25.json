UH started slowly but dominated most of the second half to beat Arizona State, 41-24. The victory gave the Warriors an 11-3 mark and capped a season some (though maybe not members of the 1992 team who first won 11) will call UH's best., 25976=Hawaii responded with a 72-yard scoring drive, capped by Brennan's 21-yard touchdown pass to Bess with 5:16 left., 17325=It is the fourth victory in five bowl games for Hawaii in June Jones' eight seasons as coach., 23484=His 38-yard touchdown reception from Brennan at 12:29 of the third quarter allowed the quarterback to tie Klingler's record and more importantly, tied the game at 10 and gave UH momentum on both sides of the ball. Also, the score was on a sideline pattern that, as Jones said, set up other routes for later in the game., 18639=\"Where's June hiding these receivers? No one was talking about him,\" Sun Devils coach Dirk Koetter said of Rivers. \"(No.) 84's as good a receiver as we've seen.\", 18319=The old record for receiving yardage in a bowl game was 299 by Fresno State's Rodney Wright in the 2001 Silicon Valley Classic. The previous UH mark was 285 by Ashley Lelie against Air Force, also in 2001. Also, the 14 catches tied the school single-game mark shared by Chad Owens and Davone Bess., 26511=Now the question is if that \"something special\" will continue in 2007.}",
