Combinations usable in Pok\u00e9mon Contests Many moves are both a follow-up move for one combination while themselves able to be followed up by another move. This, however, is not allowed, and if a move is used as a follow-up move, it will not set up another move to follow it. Several of these combinations were actually introduced in Generation II before Contests as \"combination attacks\" which offered beneficial bonuses when used in battle, such as Defense Curl and Rollout. A Contest combination is a group of several moves, which, when used in Contests and Super Contests, will form a specially recognized combination with another move used afterwards, gaining the user more appeal points.
