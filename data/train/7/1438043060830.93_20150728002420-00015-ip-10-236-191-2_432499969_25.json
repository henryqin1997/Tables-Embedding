However, he fell five runs short of becoming the first No. 11 to score a Test century. Later that year, he produced his Test best of 6 for 40 against Bangladesh in Khulna and ended the two-Test series as the joint-highest wicket-taker with 12 wickets. ESPNcricinfo staff, 64010=Tino Best brought qualities to the West Indies bowling attack that were missing for too long. Aggressive, confident and energetic, the 5 feet 8 inches Best carries the fight to the very end. He topped the regional averages in 2003 and was selected for the third Test at home to Australia in May 2003, although he didn't take a wicket., 70180=Jan 11, 2014, 68586=Feb 8, 2015, 64450=Temperamentally, he has been likened to his fellow Barbadian, the great Wes Hall, especially in his exuberance and speed. Clocking in as fast as 92mph, Best found it hard to learn control - physically and mentally. He was last picked for a one-day series in May 2006 against Zimbabwe at home. In February 2008, Best, frustrated at not receiving a West Indies contract, signed up for the ICL. He quit the ICL the following year and found himself back in the Test squad, unexpectedly, after the senior team boycotted the St Vincent Test against Bangladesh over a contract dispute., 34263=Born August 26, 1981, 3rd Avenue, Richmond Gap, St. Michael, Barbados, 69447=Jul 5, 2014}",
