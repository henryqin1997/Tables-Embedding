I mean, that has to make it less of an upset, especially considering his coaching opponent was Jim O'Brien., 209431=Other than that, who could seriously think that the Knicks had a 70% chance of taking out the two-time defending champs Bulls in 1993? I know they had home court advantage but still... And I just don't get why the Lakers beating the Spurs in 2008 ranks as an upset? They were clearly the best team of the 2 that year, by far. I love the Spurs but they were already starting to get old at that point., 205654=This entry was posted on Monday, December 7th, 2009 at 3:04 pm and is filed under Data Dump, History, Statgeekery, Statistical +/-. You can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed. Both comments and pings are currently closed., 215177=The Knicks did some serious damage in 1999, though I think it should be noted that it was the lockout season, so only 40 or so games were played. The Knicks started off really poorly after trading for Sprewell and Camby, but they came on strong at the end of the season. Had it been a full 82 game season, I think they would have finished with better stats and those upsets wouldn't have been so glaring., 209093=1993 Spurs - Blazers : the Blazers did have 3 very strong seasons from 1990 to 1992 but they were clearly declining in 1993 as most of their best players (Drexler, Porter, Williams) were starting to show their age... Anyway this was a 1st round between #4 and #5 seeds so I would hardly call it an upset, let alone rank it n\u00b03, 212221=The Sonics also had a great run in 1993, they beat a really good Houston team in the 2nd round and it took an amazing Barkley to take them out in 7 in the WCF: 43 pts - 15 rbs - 10 asts in game 5 and 44 pts - 24 rbs in game 7 for Sir Charles !!!, 214066=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/NYK/1998.html, 211535=Man, those 90's Sonics teams tremendously underperformed in the playoffs. You forget because they made it the one year, but they really had the best regular season team in the west from 1994-96 and fell crushingly early twice. I chose to blame Earvin Johnson, Derrick McKey, and the Sasquatch.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Let's take an example: In last year's Finals, the Lakers and Magic played these players: Again, where homecourt = 1 if the team is at home and 0 if they're on the road. Armed with these single-game probabilities, all that's left is to use them to calculate the odds of winning a series of a given length with a given # of home games. This of course means you need to calculate not only the probability of each series outcome, but also the probability that the series ends in each specific # of games (for instance, winning a series in four games would require 4 consecutive wins -- WWWW -- while you could win in five games four different ways -- WWWLW, WWLWW, WLWWW, or LWWWW). xWP = 1 / (1 + exp(0.622 - 0.168(tm_srs) + 0.168(opp_srs) - 1.244(homecourt))) Continuing our series on huge playoff upsets, I've taken the methodology I laid out on Friday and applied it to every playoff series from 1991-2009 to determine the probability of each team winning, given the distribution of minutes for their players in the series. This is accomplished by finding weighted averages of the team's players' and opponents' seasonal SRS-SPM scores (see Part I for an explanation), and plugging them into the following equation to produce a single-game expected winning %: Posted by Neil Paine on December 7, 2009",
    "textAfterTable": "With an SRS of 10.70, vs. an opposing SRS of 11.05, the Lakers could expect to beat the Magic at home 63.7% of the time and 33.6% of the time on the road. So to determine their probability of winning a 7-game series vs. Orlando in which they had the home-court advantage, we need to calculate their probability of winning WWWW, WWWLW, etc.: WP = (.637 * .637 * .336 * .366) + (.637 * .637 * .336 * (1 - .336) * .336) + ... + ((1 - .637) * (1 - .637) * (1 - .336) * .336 * .336 * .637 * .637) = .519 And so on and so forth. Do that for each of the 70 different ways either team can win a 7-game series, and the answer is 0.519, their probability of winning 4 out of 7 games against the Magic with 4 games at home and 3 on the road. Finally, to judge the impressiveness of each series victory, I subtracted the winner's expected odds of winning the series (given the distribution of minutes they used in the series itself) from 100%, or the actual odds that they won the series. Like the post last Friday, this gives little credit to teams that won series they were \"supposed to\" win, but gives underdogs a big boost for toppling teams they should have had a slim chance of defeating. Anyway, without further ado, here are the 25 biggest playoff series",
