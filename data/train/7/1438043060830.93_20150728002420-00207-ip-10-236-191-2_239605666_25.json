    "textAfterTable": "Number 90 Status Resolved Submitted 11 Aug 2000 By Waclaw Gudowski (wacek@neutron.kth.se) Title Error in MCNP/sabcol reported for nonthermal problem Details MCNP crashes with error in sabcol when using data from ENDF/B-VI Release 6. Comments There turned out to be two problems here. When processing angular distributions using ltt=3 with newfor=0 (MCNP4B compatibility), there was an extra tosend that caused the code to skip over the first reaction after the elastic MF=4. This lead to a bad tyr=0 value, which somehow causes MCNP to issue a confusing error message about sabcol, even when no S(alpha,beta) data are being used. Second, the code was finding the wrong value for the lct parameter (lab or cm) for sections of File 4 that were fully isotropic. This also can result in an incorrect value for the ACE tyr parameter, which leads to the strange message from sabcol. This problem was introduced",
