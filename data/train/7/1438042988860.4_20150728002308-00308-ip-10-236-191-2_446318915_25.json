The device includes a connection tube and a sealable cap having an outer casing member with a lower, outer circumferential surface, an attachment member annularly positioned on a portion of the lower, outer circumferential surface, and an inner casing member having an inner casing sidewall and a bottom disc-shaped occlusion plate defining a cylindrical void space configured to receive a connection tube. The plate can be integrally connected to the inner casing sidewall via a thin-wall section sized to break by the insertion of an insertion edge of the connection tube. The device can also include an overcap sized to mate to the sealable cap. 20100122991 Published Description Patent application number Tadahiro Kojima, Tokyo-To JP 01-01-2009 Medical guide wire - A medical guide wire 20090005706 Published Description Patent application number Tadahiro Koike, Aichi-Ken JP 01-03-2013 GUIDEWIRE - A guidewire includes a core shaft, a coil body that covers the core shaft, and a joining portion formed of metal solder that couples the core shaft and the coil body. The coil body includes a tungsten wire and a noble metal plating layer that covers at least a portion of a surface of the tungsten wire. A surface of the noble metal plating",

Accordingly, even if a die height value is set to a value small enough to cause an overload, the press load can be restricted before the occurrence of the overload, and this can save the trouble of strictly adjusting the die height value. Further, pressure-application time in the vicinity of a bottom dead center can be lengthened, and a breakthrough phenomenon can be suppressed from occurring at the end of pressure application. Still further, because the overload does not occur, pressure oil is not relieved, so that the interruption of a press operation is avoided. 04-19-2012 20140202223 DIE CUSHION APPARATUS OF PRESS MACHINE AND DIE CUSHION CONTROLLING METHOD - According to the die cushion apparatus of a press machine and the die cushion controlling method of the present invention, in holding the cushion pad on standby at a desired standby position, it is possible to hold the cushion pad on standby in parallel with the lower faces of the dies mounted to the slide, and",
