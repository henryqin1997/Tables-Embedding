    "textBeforeTable": "FRESHMAN YEAR Curriculum in Agricultural Business and Economics (AGEC) While the AGEC student may choose a general program of study, selection of one of three career tracks can provide more directed specialized training in Agribusiness Management and Marketing, Farm Management or Natural Resources Management. The Agribusiness track emphasizes training in management, marketing/sales and finance. Employment opportunities may involve such areas as management, sales, finance, government, public relations or personnel. The Farm Management track provides training in management and decision-making at the farm level along with the technical aspects of production agriculture. Graduates can pursue careers in the farm sector as owner-operators or managers. Employment opportunities for graduates of the Natural Resources Management track will increase over time as resource scarcity, environmental and rural development issues become more critical. Public institutions which are entrusted with managing and safeguarding our natural resource endowment are primary employers of graduates in this area. Students who forego the career tracks and opt for a general program of study can design it to help them reach their goals and help ensure a rewarding career. Beyond the identified career areas, graduates of the program complete advanced degrees in the discipline and in business and law schools. The Agricultural Business and Economics curriculum provides broad technical training and a strong liberal arts background to prepare students for careers in agribusiness, the largest industry in the U.S. Agricultural Business and Economics \u00a0 Rural Sociology - A minor in Rural Sociology for non-RSOC majors requires at least",
