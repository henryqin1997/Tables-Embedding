    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students I only have a few tips for prospective students: 1) Bring rain boots and a large umbrella. You wouldn't believe how much it rains in the spring. I thought I was living in Seattle there for a while! 2) You may want to allot some money for you to buy staple food items to keep in your dorm room. SBU does a pretty good job with their food at Mellars (the cafeteria) but it is cafeteria food and you get bored with it after a while. Don't rely on the wide variety of fast food restaurants that are conveniently nearby. Make use of the kitchen available in every dorm. 3) Get to know your professors outside of class. They are wonderful people and have lots of things to teach you within and outside of the classroom walls. 4) You don't need to bring your whole closet with you the first day. You've got time to go home and get the things you discover you still need before the weather becomes too dramatic to handle. I learned this the hard way. 5) Don't date anyone the first couple of months. This is the time to make friends. 6) Bring a bike/longboard/skateboard/rollerskates(?) because there will be mornings you run late. 7) Keep your grades up. You don't want to lose your scholarships. 8) Second semester is tougher than first semester in every single way possible. 9) Call whoever helped you make it",
