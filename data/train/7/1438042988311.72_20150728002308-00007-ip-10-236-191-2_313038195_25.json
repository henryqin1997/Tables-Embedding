    "textBeforeTable": "Binary safety switch Trinary safety switch There are two types of safety switches a Binary and a Trinary. The Binary safety switch will cut off the compressor if the pressure gets too high (380psi)or too low (30 psi). The Trinary safety switch will cut off at the same pressures but will also turn on an electric fan when the pressure reaches 220psi helping to cool the system. The BC Broncos A/C system comes with a Binary switch but can be upgraded if needed.
