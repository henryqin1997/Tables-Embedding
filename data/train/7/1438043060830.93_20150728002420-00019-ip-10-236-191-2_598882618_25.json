Although the military agreement was rigorously debated in the US it was clear that \"containment had taken a distinct turn to military means\" 27 with any provocative military threats potentially triggering a Third general war in Europe, but now under the shadow of nuclear weaponry. Only four months later, in August, the Russian military successfully detonated an atomic weapon themselves., 99413=Wide Sargasso Sea is the prequel to Jane Eyre; it is Jean Rhys's salvage of the insane Creole woman - Bertha Rochester of Thornfield Hall. [IMG-3] [3] Wide Sargasso Sea is typical of many of Rhys's novels, as her preoccupation with the suffering of dependent women is reinforced. The novel is set during a significant period in Jamaica history - the time following the passing of the Emancipation Act of 1838. This was a period of immense racial tension, and Rhys depicts this tension in the mind of young Antoinette Cosway. Antoinette is disturbed by her racial identity, as she is ridiculed for being a \"white cockroach\". As a direct result of her Creole background and upbringing, Antoinette grows up as a misplaced individual. She is a woman who is trapped in her homeland and unable to escape her harsh realities: \"I often wonder who I am and where is my country and where do I belong and why was I ever born at all\" 2. [IMG-4] [4]She is often weary of men and she seems to suffer from a kind of sporadic amnesia. 3 Unlike the stable Victorian society of Jane Eyre, Wide Sargasso Sea portrays the racial inequalities apparent in many societies., 253814=Gaddis, John, Lewis, 'Containment: A Reassesment', from Foreign Affairs, 55 (1976-77) pg. 873 - 887, 267307=[9]The rhetoric continued to escalate. Stalin made a speech on the eve of the election of the Supreme Soviet which, although not particularly threatening or expansionist were misconstrued by the many analysts, including Justice William Douglas who believed that it was \"the declaration of World War Three\". 13 [IMG-10] [10]These comments worried Washington, who requested an explanation and background information on the meaning of the speech from the American ambassador in Moscow, George F. Kennan. Kennan then sent back a 5,540-word telegram to Washington on the 22nd of February 1946, outlining his beliefs that the Soviet Union was a \"political force committed fanatically to the belief that with [the] US there can be no permanent modus vivendi.\" 14 He claimed that the Soviets were \"highly sensitive to the logic of force.\" Kennan's telegram was widely circulated throughout the Washington administration, and was followed soon after by the \"declarations of Cold War\" 15 by Churchill and Stalin. Churchill, now opposition leader in Britain, in his Fulton speech, called for a military alliance between the English-speaking western nations, outside the United Nations, that could resist the \"iron curtain [that] has descended across the continent\" 16. Stalin responded in an interview with the Russian newspaper Pravda saying that Churchill was sowing [IMG-11] [11]\"the seeds of dissention among the Allied states\" 17 and that the British opposition leader was the heir of Hitler's racial supremacy beliefs. Stalin said \"Mr. Churchill's position is a war position, a call for war on the U.S.S.R.\" 18, 317562=Kitchen, M., A World In Flames, in Copland, I., and Hancock, E. (Eds), World War II: The Crushing of the Axis, A Course Handbook. Monash University, Melbourne, 2000., 252996=Stalin's interview with Pravda, 13 March 1946, reprinted in Copland and Hancock (ed.)

The war in the Pacific still needed to be won and the Russian promise to declare war on Japan six weeks after the end of the European war was considered vital in bringing about a swift end to the Pacific war. However, by the Potsdam conference in late July, 1945 Truman had been informed of the successful explosion of an atomic weapon on New Mexico - a development that gave him an appreciable confidence in his negotiations with Stalin. 11 Although Potsdam was intended to help to clarify the post-war issues that still remained unresolved, the negations were frustrating and did not progress noticeably on several key issues. Although Stalin had not been officially informed of the US atomic weapons, Truman, Stalin and Churchill were well aware that the unresolved issues were now to be resolved in a nuclear age. 12, 727858=It is also arguable that the media, instead of being seen as a 'neutral umpire' between competing interests and an efficient way of disseminating information, critical theorists argue that the media are 'very much implicated in power relations' (Juredini and Poole, 2000, p. 313) in society. The most critical view of the media's operations represents the reading, listening and viewing public as victims of a 'giant con trick' (Juredini and Poole, 2000, p. 313), believing in a truth convenient for the powerful groups who describe and interpret the world around us, thus, reinforcing the social stereotypes., 343754=This is good stuff. The student outlines Breitman's argument - that \"the Final Solution must have been concretely adopted\" at the beginning of 1941. But she then refers to a document (Goering to Heydrich) which suggests the plan was still being devised six months later in July 1941., 109960=Angier, Carole. Jean Rhys: Life and work . London: Andre Deutsch, 1990., 721813=Similarly, in print advertising, women were seen to be in the home, being dependent upon men, and not making 'independent and important decisions' (Creedon, 1989, p. 249), and are often viewed by themselves and by others as sex objects. In addition, the symbols involved in advertising often have a more profound influence on social behaviour than the stated messages the advertising wishes to put forward. Thus, gender divisions are often symbolised in 'what goes on in the setting or the background of a commercial' (Giddens, 1989, p. 446), rather than what it is explicitly selling. In many advertisements, men appear mentally and physically alert, while women are shown gazing into the distance in a dreamy way (Goffman, 1979, cited in Giddens, 1989, p. 446)., 261680=When the political leaders of the three countries met, in early February 1945, the end of the war in Europe was imminent. The Yalta conference sought to settle the allies' apprehensions about the post-war period. Despite President Roosevelt's belief that the \"relations in peacetime should be as strong as they had been in war\" [IMG-5] [5]3 the leaders were nonetheless cautious of the actions and intent of their allies. Soviet officials had often questioned US and British motives in the war, from the appeasement of Hitler to their holding back of a second front 4, and toward the end of the war began to suspect that the US and British diplomats were brokering a separate peace with Nazi leaders. [IMG-6] [6]Likewise, Soviet actions in Poland had alarmed the Western allies 5 and the American ambassador to Russia W. Averell Harriman wrote, \"There is every indication the Soviet Union will become a world bully\" 6., 270592=Less than three months later, the US government announced that they would lend assistance to a united European plan for economic recovery. They were fearful that the still sluggish European economies would lead to more social instability, and potentially aid the spread of communism in Europe. British and French foreign minsters invited representatives of countries from all across Europe, including Russian foreign minister Molotov, to Paris to discuss the proposed American aid. Several states under Russian influence expressed and interest in the meeting in Paris. However, Soviet officials sensed a ruse, and feared that such a co-ordinated plan would be a \"Trojan Horse of the American dollar\" 22. Moscow threatened grim consequences for Eastern countries who wished to participate in the plan, and their harsh rejection of the Marshall Plan has been seen the \"the moment when the Soviet boot crushed itself into the face of Eastern Europe.\" 23 [IMG-12] [12]Some historians feel that the invitation for Russia to participate in the Marshall Plan was simply an attempt to gain a moral high ground when they refused 24, or for the propaganda value of blaming the Russians for its failure 25. What is certain is that the Marshall Plan simply created a bigger rift between the two rival governments. 26, 737794=[6]Similarly, the mass media construct and reinforce social stereotypes around ethnicity, particularly through their stereotypical images and portrayal of ethnic groups performing certain roles in society. Sociological approaches which attach particular importance to racism emphasise the limitations imposed on ethnic minorities by such hostility and discrimination (Haralambos and Holborn, 1995, p.688). [IMG-7] [7]The attention is not placed upon the ethnic minority itself, however on the wider society which is the minority group., 719043=Stereotyping is a mental activity that is neither natural or necessary; however, due to laziness, upbringing or coincidental experiences (Lester, 1996, p.1), the stereotyping of individuals results in harmful generalisations that ultimately deny an individual's 'unique contribution to humanity' (Lester, 1996, p.1). When the mass media engage in stereotyping, misleading representations concerning members from diverse cultural groups are confirmed. In this essay, a broad range of texts will be used to examine the ways in which the mass media construct and reinforce social stereotypes around gender, ethnicity and age, as well as how the media shape one's imagination though direct images., 331448=[13]However, while Browning's argument over the date of the Final Solution is the most credible, his argument is flawed by his insistence that this decision, and subsequent ones regarding the Holocaust, were based on military victories alone. While military success facilitated the implementation of the Final Solution, it didn't solely contribute to the decision to adopt and carry it out. We see for example, no significant policy shift in subsequent years when the regime was then facing military failure. The Nazis adopted the policy because they believed in it, and viewed it as the best solution to the Jewish problem - something they had been searching for since Dachau was established in 1933 12., 581962=St. Thomas Aquinas was born in 1225 in the ancient kingdom of Sicily. After being ordained as a priest in 1250, he began teaching and writing at the University of Paris in 1252. Aquinas was to become one of the leading philosophers of his day, writing extensively on theological issues, and laying down many of the principles of modern philosophy., 30365=Griffith Jr., Kelley. 1990. Writing Essays in Literature: A Guide and Style Sheet, 3 rd Edition. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich., 727061=Despite the media's reinforcement of social stereotypes among the aged, awareness could assist a better understanding of the elderly in particular. Advertising agencies and advertisers employ young people to write and prepare commercials. Most recent writers on this subject could conclude that 'the age of the advertising producers is an important factor' (Lester, 1996, p. 116) in creating the stereotypical images of age. Young creators working on senior accounts can be a problem, as they do not have the senior's perspective, thus, engaging typically in stereotyping. Such hurdles can be overcome by consulting the large amount of research readily available on seniors, and by focusing on a group composed of seniors, which in turn will reinforce alternative views on age and aging., 530152=It is not so helpful to mention other arguments (and their flaws) without explaining what these arguments are. When you have a word limit of only 1000 words or so, you will often need to limit your discussion to only a few arguments. It is best to indicate your intention in your introduction - e.g. \"In this essay I will confine myself to Schadewald's first argument - and then stay clear of additional arguments that you are not going to be able to elaborate on.\", 317767=\"Location of Concentration and Extermination Camps in Europe and Total Number of Jewish People Killed (By Country), Copland, I. and Hancock, E.

The Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) was declared in May. West Germany were signatories to the NATO agreements and were thoroughly integrated into Western Europe's trade systems. In October, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was founded, thoroughly under the influence of the Soviet regime., 96334=Wyndham, F. and D. Melly, eds. Jean Rhys: Letters 1931-1966. England: Penguin Books, 1984., 322306=It is Friedlander, in his article \"Step by Step: The Expansion of Murder, 1939-1941\" 1, who [IMG-3] [3]offers a very simplistic answer as to when the Final Solution began. Friedlander factually describes the lead-up to the decision to start killing the handicapped in late 1938. However, his omission of dates and his simplistic account lead to conclusions which fail to consider the reasons behind certain events, and how their preceding events unfolded: [IMG-4] \"As the T4 killing centres closed, the murder of the Jews had commenced...in the East\" 2. Consequently, his opinion that mass murder was decided on back in 1938 is contradicted by the stages of the Holocaust that preceded the killing ones. [4]Ghettoisation, which occurred in 1939-1940, shows that murder was not always the option favoured by the Nazis. 3 [IMG-5] [5]Furthermore, Friedlander's attempts to connect the Final Solution to the handicapped program, in a bid to show that the Holocaust was a step by step process first started in 1938, are too simplistic. He uses his factual account of the Nazis' racial beliefs to unsuccessfully justify his contention that the two events, along with the killing of the Gypsies, were linked together in one large Final Solution. It is true that the Nazis modelled the industrialised Jewish genocide on the handicapped killings. However, the introduction of gassings and the high number of extermination camp staff with experience in T4 killing centres hardly shows the Jewish murders to be the next step in a Holocaust process - one that started with the handicapped killings., 314886=However, while Browning's argument over the date of the Final Solution is the most credible, his argument is flawed by his insistence that this decision, and subsequent ones regarding the Holocaust, were based on military victories alone. While military success facilitated the implementation of the Final Solution, it didn't solely contribute to the decision to adopt and carry it out. We see for example, no significant policy shift in subsequent years when the regime was then facing military failure. The Nazis adopted the policy because they believed in it, and viewed it as the best solution to the Jewish problem - something they had been searching for since Dachau was established in 1933 12., 315607=Overall, Browning's argument offers the most concrete explanation of the beginnings of the Holocaust and when the decision was made to implement the Final Solution. Both Breitman and Friedlander, by viewing mass murder as an option chosen in the late 1930s, contradict the historical record of the Holocaust itself - that it occurred in stages with mass killings only marking the last few. With a lack of evidence, and indeed a firm amount levelled against them, these two authors speculate and attempt to visualise connections that are unable to be proved. Browning, by way of his weaknesses, serves to emphasise the difficulties that all historians face in trying to piece together the mystery that was the Nazi regime and its Holocaust. However, he rleies on actual documented evidence and doesn't ignore facts in order to try and support his assumptions. Thus, it can be concluded that his article is the most persuasive version of when the decision was made to adopt the Final Solution: in mid-1941., 299340=Editing's pretty important I spend a lot of time reading and rereading what I've written. I like to print it out and take it away from the computer so I can see it as a whole essay rather than just see it as bits of text on the screen, see its in its context. I like rereading it out loud because it helps to pick up problems with grammar and also, yeh, conceptual sort of jumps and you know, that sort of thing. As I'm reading through it, I'll mark my corrections on, you know, the paper and just go back to the computer and flick them in., 208575=[5] The memos in question indicate that high-level discussion of some form of 'final solution' did take place early in 1941. [6] Danneker's memo in January 1941 disclosed that Hitler wanted a 'final solution' of the Jewish question. [7] A month later, Eichmann in a meeting at the Propaganda Office announced to rival bureaucrats that Hitler was determined to implement a 'final evacuation' of the Jews...., 703582=. . .Mikosa found similar results in her study for Womensport Australia, where she found that journalists discussed the female athletes' \"elegance\" or called women \"blonde girl(s)\" and a journalist even wrote about one athlete's \"domestic routine of cooking\" (1998). With this in mind, I was absolutely appalled to hear an Australian television commentator commend the women's Dutch hockey team when they won a bronze medal on the 29/9/2000. When the team got on the dais to receive their medal, the male commentator said \"ahh look at the pretty little Dutch girls\" without one consideration of their athleticism or sporting ability whatsoever. It was a sad moment for Australian commentating and strengthens the arguments of Philips and Mizoka regarding the language the media uses to portray sports women and women's sport alike., 240531=During the war the allied leaders were aware that victory in Europe and the Pacific meant much more than just the abolition of an intolerable political regime. Talking in 1944, Stalin said: \"This war is not as in the past; whoever occupies a territory also imposes on it his own social system. Everyone imposes his own system as far as his army has power to do so. It cannot be otherwise.\" 2 Consequently, as the threat of Nazism in Europe was clearly destined for defeat, the attention of the allies turned to post-war Europe. With fear of a Communist dominated Eastern and Central Europe in mind, British army chiefs even went so far as to advocate spearhead assaults on Berlin, Prague and Vienna in order to stop them falling into Soviet hands., 203775=[5] The memos in question indicate that high-level discussion of some form of 'final solution' did take place early in 1941. [6] Danneker's memo in January 1941 disclosed that Hitler wanted a 'final solution' of the Jewish question. [7] A month later, Eichmann in a meeting at the Propaganda Office announced to rival bureaucrats that Hitler was determined to implement a 'final evacuation' of the Jews. [8] The problem however, with such evidence is that there is doubt among historians about what these terms actually meant at the time. [9] 'Final solution' and 'final evacuation' may have been code words for mass extermination, but they may equally have referred to some less murderous Nazi policies. [10] It was known for example, that other options being considered around this time were the mass deportations of Jews to Madagascar, and also mass sterilisation. [11] Breitman's argument relies on an assumption that these terms could refer only to what later became the Holocaust. [12] He states that to require 'an unambiguous blueprint for extermination' from the Nazi archives is asking for an impossible standard of proof (p. 274). [13] But, unfortunately no such document has been uncovered by historians and so, we have to be cautious about how we interpret Nazi intentions at the time., 722587=A central gender concern is that advertising is a 'shorthand form of communication' (Creedon, 1989, p. 249) that must make contact with the consumer immediately, in order to establish a shared experience or identification, and is most popularly undertaken through stereotypical imagery. In turn, these images form the 'cores of [one's] personal tradition, the defenses of [one's] position in society' (Creedon, 1989, p. 249), thus reinforcing the social stereotype., 695314=NOTE: for further help with using the passive voice, go to the passives tutorial in the Grammar section of this Website., 321191=[1]The beginnings of the Holocaust, that is to say the point at which it was decided that a program of mass murder would be undertaken against Europe's 11 million Jews, has been a much debated topic among historians. Was it always the direction in which the Nazi leadership was headed, or was the final decision not made until 1941 when Operation Barbarosa was well under way? Christopher Browning, Richard Breitman and Henry Friedlander present differing views as to when the Final Solution was adopted, none of which are overwhelmingly convincing. However, it is Browning who pieces together [IMG-2] [2]the most concrete of opinions, as Breitman and Friedlander become bogged down in speculative and simplistic assumptions., 202531=[1] Breitman, in his article Plans for the Final Solution, refers to the controversy about the origins of the Holocaust as the \"intentionalist-functionalist\" debate; that is one between those who think the Holocaust was a preconceived Nazi plan, and those who think it was improvised hastily, notably after early German victories in the Soviet Union in mid-1941. [2] Brietman, in contrast to Browning, is very much an 'intentionalist', arguing that the 'murderous intentions' of Hitler, Himmler and other key Nazis were well underway before the invasion of the Soviet Union. [3] Whilst he admits that many of the Nazi documents on this issue are \"inexact\", he suggests that this is not because the Holocaust plan itself was uncertain, but rather because the Nazi leadership wanted to \"conceal\" and \"veil\" its real intentions from others (p. 271). [4] To support his case for pre-planning, Breitman relies on two main sources of evidence: memos from two officials in the Nazi Jewish Office at the time - Adolf Eichmann and Theodore Dannecker; and the Nuremberg testimony of Viktor Brack, an official in the Fuhrer Chancellery, 244099=After the German surrender on the 8th May, domestic political pressure forced Truman to swiftly end the lend-lease agreements that the US had with both Russia and Britain, amongst others. The agreements needed to be terminated as they were legally only permitted by Congress under a state of declared war. Although Truman wished to wind down the lend-lease agreement in a diplomatically sensitive manner, a misunderstanding in a government department lead to the severest of withdrawals of this foreign aid, even to the extent of requiring some ships to turn around and return to port. The Soviet outcry was immediate and led to the suspicion amongst the Soviets that the US was provocatively using foreign aid as a tool of coercion. 10, 253189=Truman H., speech to congress, 12 March 1947, reprinted in Copland and Hancock (ed.)

Understandably, most research about the influence of television and the media has concerned children, given the sheer volume of their viewing and the 'possible implications for socialisation' (Giddens, 1989, p. 444). In their literary pursuits, books have the capabilities to teach children what other children do in their culture and what is expected of them. In a study undertaken in America analysing preschool books, boys played a 'more significant role' in the stories by a 'ratio of 11 to 1' (cited in Newman, 2000, p. 135). Together, boys were portrayed in adventurous roles or undertook activities that required independence and strength, whereas girls were likely to be confined to indoor activities and portrayed as 'passive and dependent' (Newman, 2000, p.135)., 60765=Bronte, C. Jane Eyre. Modern Publishing Group, 1991., 251556=From the end of the Second World War to autumn 1949 the Grand Alliance that had defeated the Axis powers failed to sustain the working relationship that had won the war. The ideological and political differences were exposed in their attempts to reorder the post-war world in the image of the two rival super-powers. While the United States hoped to encourage and defend democracy (understood as liberal capitalism) in Europe and Asia the Soviet state hoped to extend their influence in Eastern Europe. While the tensions may have started as diplomatic debate, the rhetoric soon escalated, and financial aid and military alliances eventually hardened the distinction between the US and Russian spheres of influence., 248400=Less than three months later, the US government announced that they would lend assistance to a united European plan for economic recovery. They were fearful that the still sluggish European economies would lead to more social instability, and potentially aid the spread of communism in Europe. British and French foreign minsters invited representatives of countries from all across Europe, including Russian foreign minister Molotov, to Paris to discuss the proposed American aid. Several states under Russian influence expressed and interest in the meeting in Paris. However, Soviet officials sensed a ruse, and feared that such a co-ordinated plan would be a \"Trojan Horse of the American dollar\" 22. Moscow threatened grim consequences for Eastern countries who wished to participate in the plan, and their harsh rejection of the Marshall Plan has been seen the \"the moment when the Soviet boot crushed itself into the face of Eastern Europe.\" 23 Some historians feel that the invitation for Russia to participate in the Marshall Plan was simply an attempt to gain a moral high ground when they refused 24, or for the propaganda value of blaming the Russians for its failure 25. What is certain is that the Marshall Plan simply created a bigger rift between the two rival governments. 26, 187249=In 1946, an escalation of rhetoric began between the West and the Soviets. [...], 311692=From here, Breitman's argument lacks credibility, with its talk of secret plans and a reliance on speculative evidence. Breitman writes of Eichmann's announcement that Heydrich had already been entrusted with the 'final evacuation' of Jews in March 1941, saying this \"may have referred to a general policy that was still secret\" 6. Thus, he suggests something of which he has no proof. Moreover he does this constantly, asking whether Hitler, Himmler and Heydrich wouldn't have conspired over the Final Solution and kept the more 'lethal' plans for all Europe's Jews secret; again highly speculative inferences considering that the Holocaust progressed in stages., 312831=Breitman argues that just because Eichmann and Theodor Dannecker talked of a final solution in early 1941, this meant that they were naturally talking about mass murder. He substantiates this by saying that Heydrich had submitted a proposal to Hitler before the end of January, and thus this must have been the time that the Final Solution was concretely adopted. However, this contention overlooks that in July 1941, Goring authorised Heydrich to draw up another plan for a \"total solution of the Jewish question\" 7. Considering this request came after the expansion of the Einsatzgruppen's orders to include the killing of all Jews 8, it is more logical to believe that the Final Solution was in fact adopted in mid-1941., 719746=It cannot be doubted that the media profoundly influence people's attitudes and outlooks. They convey a whole variety of information which individuals would not otherwise acquire. Newspapers, books, television, radio, films, recorded music and popular magazines (Giddens, 1989, p.79) bring individuals into close contact with experiences of which we 'would otherwise have little awareness' (Giddens, 1989, p. 79). There are very few societies, in current times, even among the more traditional cultures, which remain completely untouched by the mass media. Electronic communication is accessible even to those who are completely illiterate, or in isolated areas of the world., 733372=[3]According to Juredini and Poole, gender usually refers to the 'behavioural and attitudinal characteristics' as well as roles that are learned and derived from a 'particular cultural milieu' (2000, p.171). An important source of gender information in a consumer society is television. Despite some notable exceptions, for example 'Sesame Street', most television shows continue to portray males and females in stereotypical gender roles (Sigorelli, 1990, citied in Newman, 2000, p. 136). In a recent study of television programs, male characters are more likely than female characters to occupy leadership roles and achieve them, as well as being portrayed as inquisitive. In addition, they are more likely to be portrayed in a recognisable occupation, demonstrating to audiences that males are more career orientated and dedicated to work, and emphasising stereotypes that they are the traditional 'bread winners' of the household. Alternatively, females are cast into the role of the caregiver (Thompson and Zerbinos, 1995, cited in Newman, 2000, p. 136). Despite the fact that women make up a majority of the population, most prime time characters on television are male (Smith, 1997, cited in Newman, 2000, p. 136), and are still portrayed as powerful and rational. [IMG-4] [4]Women express emotions more easily and are more likely to be flirtatious in order to get their own way., 254084=LaFaber, Walter, America, Russia and the Cold War 1945-1984, (5th edition, New York, 1985), 214151=Breitman, in his article Plans for the Final Solution, refers to the controversy about the origins of the Holocaust as the \"intentionalist-functionalist\" debate; that is one between those who think the Holocaust was a preconceived Nazi plan, and those who think it was improvised hastily, notably after early German victories in the Soviet Union in mid-1941. Brietman, in contrast to Browning, is very much an 'intentionalist', arguing that the 'murderous intentions' of Hitler, Himmler and other key Nazis were well underway before the invasion of the Soviet Union. Whilst he admits that many of the Nazi documents on this issue are \"inexact\", he suggests that this is not because the Holocaust plan itself was uncertain, but rather because the Nazi leadership wanted to \"conceal\" and \"veil\" its real intentions from others (p. 271). To support his case for pre-planning, Breitman relies on two main sources of evidence: memos from two officials in the Nazi Jewish Office at the time - Adolf Eichmann and Theodore Dannecker; and the Nuremberg testimony of Viktor Brack, an official in the Fuhrer Chancellery, 274325=[13]From the end of the Second World War to autumn 1949 the Grand Alliance that had defeated the Axis powers failed to sustain the working relationship that had won the war. The ideological and political differences were exposed in their attempts to reorder the post-war world in the image of the two rival super-powers. While the United States hoped to encourage and defend democracy (understood as liberal capitalism) in Europe and Asia the Soviet state hoped to extend their influence in Eastern Europe. While the tensions may have started as diplomatic debate, the rhetoric soon escalated, and financial aid and military alliances eventually hardened the distinction between the US and Russian spheres of influence., 95154=Angier, Carole.

England: Penguin Books, 1997., 725708=Corresponding with gender and ethnicity, the media construct and reinforce social stereotypes around age. According to Golman (cited in Lester, 1996, p.113), all too many television commercials fall back on stereotypes, showing the aged as feeble, foolish or inept, passing their time aimlessly in rocking chairs.' Because seniors are a large and increasingly affluent market, one destined to grow larger as the 1950s baby boomers mature (Lester, 1996, p.114), advertisers should be sensitive to this group. If no sensitivity is used, some seniors may take out their anger and frustration toward images and advertising by ignoring or actively boycotting the product., 49982=(1384 words), 732117=It cannot be doubted that the media profoundly influence people's attitudes and outlooks. They convey a whole variety of information which individuals would not otherwise acquire. Newspapers, books, television, radio, films, recorded music and popular magazines (Giddens, 1989, p.79) bring individuals into close contact with experiences of which we 'would otherwise have little awareness' (Giddens, 1989, p. 79). [IMG-2] [2]There are very few societies, in current times, even among the more traditional cultures, which remain completely untouched by the mass media. Electronic communication is accessible even to those who are completely illiterate, or in isolated areas of the world., 215683=The memos in question indicate that high-level discussion of some form of 'final solution' did take place early in 1941. Danneker's memo in January 1941 disclosed that Hitler wanted a 'final solution' of the Jewish question. A month later, Eichmann in a meeting at the Propaganda Office announced to rival bureaucrats that Hitler was determined to implement a 'final evacuation' of the Jews...., 332496=[14]Overall, Browning's argument offers the most concrete explanation of the beginnings of the Holocaust and when the decision was made to implement the Final Solution. Both Breitman and Friedlander, by viewing mass murder as an option chosen in the late 1930s, contradict the historical record of the Holocaust itself - that it occurred in stages with mass killings only marking the last few. With a lack of evidence, and indeed a firm amount levelled against them, these two authors speculate and attempt to visualise connections that are unable to be proved. Browning, by way of his weaknesses, serves to emphasise the difficulties that all historians face in trying to piece together the mystery that was the Nazi regime and its Holocaust. However, he rleies on actual documented evidence and doesn't ignore facts in order to try and support his assumptions. Thus, it can be concluded that his article is the most persuasive version of when the decision was made to adopt the Final Solution: in mid-1941., 180009=quote \" In 1938, Chamberlain embarked on his ill-fated trip to Munich to negotiate with Hitler\" unquote., 253937=Herring, George C., 'Lend-lease and the Origins of the Cold War 1944-45', from Journal of American History, LVI (June, 1969), 736650=Children also receive gender [5]lessons. Understandably, most research about the influence of television and the media has concerned children, given the sheer volume of their viewing and the 'possible implications for socialisation' (Giddens, 1989, p. 444). In their literary pursuits, books have the capabilities to teach children what other children do in their culture and what is expected of them. In a study undertaken in America analysing preschool books, boys played a 'more significant role' in the stories by a 'ratio of 11 to 1' (cited in Newman, 2000, p. 135). Together, boys were portrayed in adventurous roles or undertook activities that required independence and strength, whereas girls were likely to be confined to indoor activities and portrayed as 'passive and dependent' (Newman, 2000, p.135)., 573596=I feel that it's a good idea when writing an essay, even if it's only a 1000 words to do it in a couple of intervals rather than one. That way rather than writing for a solid time interval, you're writing over separate intervals, you get refreshed in-between, you've got more focus on the task. If you have a break in between, you can just go outside, kick around the football-what I did with my brother. Just continue with your essay after that, then you've re-charged, your brain has had a rest, rather than just writing solidly for x amount of hours going, \"Ah, I really can't be bothered doing this.\", 188542=In 1946, an escalation of rhetoric began between the West and the Soviets. Stalin, the Soviet leader, made a speech on the eve of the election of the Supreme Soviet which, although not particularly threatening or expansionist were misconstrued by many analysts, including Justice William Douglas who believed that it was \"the declaration of World War Three\" 1.These comments worried Washington, who requested an explanation and background information on the meaning of the speech from the American ambassador in Moscow, George F. Kennan. Kennan then sent back a 5,540-word telegram to Washington on the 22nd of February 1946, outlining his beliefs that the Soviet Union was a \"political force committed fanatically to the belief that with [the] US there can be no permanent modus vivendi\" 2. He claimed that the Soviets were \"highly sensitive to the logic of force.\" Kennan's telegram was widely circulated throughout the Washington administration, and was followed soon after by the \"declarations of Cold War\" 3 by Churchill and Stalin. Churchill, now opposition leader in Britain, in his Fulton speech, called for a military alliance between the English-speaking western nations, outside the United Nations, that could resist the \"iron curtain [that] has descended across the continent\" 4. Stalin responded in an interview with the Russian newspaper Pravda saying that Churchill was sowing \"the seeds of dissention among the Allied states\" 5. and that the British opposition leader was the heir of Hitler's racial supremacy beliefs. Stalin said \"Mr. Churchill's position is a war position, a call for war on the U.S.S.R.\" 6., 720431=According to Juredini and Poole, gender usually refers to the 'behavioural and attitudinal characteristics' as well as roles that are learned and derived from a 'particular cultural milieu' (2000, p.171). An important source of gender information in a consumer society is television. Despite some notable exceptions, for example 'Sesame Street', most television shows continue to portray males and females in stereotypical gender roles (Sigorelli, 1990, citied in Newman, 2000, p. 136). In a recent study of television programs, male characters are more likely than female characters to occupy leadership roles and achieve them, as well as being portrayed as inquisitive. In addition, they are more likely to be portrayed in a recognisable occupation, demonstrating to audiences that males are more career orientated and dedicated to work, and emphasising stereotypes that they are the traditional 'bread winners' of the household.

Women express emotions more easily and are more likely to be flirtatious in order to get their own way., 641830=In 1972 the New York City Chapter of the National Organisation for Women (NOW) conducted the first major study, which focused on television commercials for women. One thousand, two hundred and forty-one commercials were examined. Results showed that almost all women in advertisements were situated at home, with 42.6 percent of the women involved in household chores, 37.5 percent were presented as accessories to men; 16.7 percent as sex objects, and only 0.3 percent of the women were analysed by the NOW to be autonomous individuals., 310863=If Friedlander is too simplistic, then Breitman, in his article \"Plans for the Final Solution in Early 1941\" 4, gets himself bogged down in events which leads him to draw speculative conclusions. Breitman argues that the Final Solution was finalised in early 1941, if not late 1940, well before the Germans had invaded the Soviet Union. He, like Friedlander, also believes that mass murder was seen as a partial solution to the Jewish question, along with the handicapped one, before the war began. However, Breitman's assertion that these early killings, combined with the ones committed by the Einsatzgruppen during Barbarosa, signified the long-term intentions of Hitler, fails to consider that the orders given to the killing squads initially didn't include the murder of all Jews. 5, 85756=Jean Rhys's literary success, Wide Sargasso Sea, was published in 1966, more than a century after Charlotte Bronte's famous novel, Jane Eyre. Set during the same era, both novels articulate differing aspects of women's experience during the 19th century. At the time of its publication in 1847, Jane Eyre created quite a stir among the literary world, as it controversially spoke on behalf of women. Charlotte Bronte's novel primarily explores the emancipation of a virtuous young woman, Jane Eyre, who is \"cast in a different mound to the majority\". 1 Jane's significant journey toward selfhood fervently challenged the nineteenth-century acceptance of women's subservient position in society. In contrast, Wide Sargsasso Sea starkly reveals the fate of a disillusioned Creole woman who is powerless and unnerved in post-colonial West Indian society. Jean Rhy's novel articulates some aspects of women's experience that Jane Eyre inevitably suppresses. Whilst Jane's nature is portrayed as unrelenting, Antoinette Cosway is exposed as a white Creole madwoman who is vulnerable and dependent. Jane Eyre presents the ideal situation for a woman during the 19th century - a marriage of choice and of eventual harmony and bliss. Wide Sargasso Sea, on the other hand, reveals the darker side of marriage, where the psychological well being of the woman threatens the marriage. Whilst Jane is looked upon as a heroine, Antoinette is viewed as submissive. Compared with Antoinette's detached narrative voice, Jane's narrative is audacious and precise. Both novels deal with an unforgiving patriarchal society, but Jane and Antoinette have diverse responses to their respective societies., 253380=Churchill, W., speech at Fulton, Missouri, 5 March 1946, reprinted in Copland and Hancock (ed.) World War II: Crushing the Axis - a course handbook, (Melbourne, 2000), 309247=It is Friedlander, in his article \"Step by Step: The Expansion of Murder, 1939-1941\" 1, who offers a very simplistic answer as to when the Final Solution began. Friedlander factually describes the lead-up to the decision to start killing the handicapped in late 1938. However, his omission of dates and his simplistic account lead to conclusions which fail to consider the reasons behind certain events, and how their preceding events unfolded: \"As the T4 killing centres closed, the murder of the Jews had commenced...in the East\" 2. Consequently, his opinion that mass murder was decided on back in 1938 is contradicted by the stages of the Holocaust that preceded the killing ones. Ghettoisation, which occurred in 1939-1940, shows that murder was not always the option favoured by the Nazis. 3 Furthermore, Friedlander's attempts to connect the Final Solution to the handicapped program, in a bid to show that the Holocaust was a step by step process first started in 1938, are too simplistic. He uses his factual account of the Nazis' racial beliefs to unsuccessfully justify his contention that the two events, along with the killing of the Gypsies, were linked together in one large Final Solution. It is true that the Nazis modelled the industrialised Jewish genocide on the handicapped killings. However, the introduction of gassings and the high number of extermination camp staff with experience in T4 killing centres hardly shows the Jewish murders to be the next step in a Holocaust process - one that started with the handicapped killings., 316960=Browning, Christopher, \"The Euphoria of Victory and the Final Solution:Summer-Fall 1941\", in German Studies Review, vol xvii, no 3, (oct 1994), in Copland, I., and Hancock, E. (Eds), World War II: The Crushing of the Axis, A Course Handbook. Monash University, Melbourne, 2000., 326322=From here, [7]Breitman's argument lacks credibility, with its talk of secret plans and a reliance on speculative evidence. Breitman writes of Eichmann's announcement that Heydrich had already been entrusted with the 'final evacuation' of Jews in March 1941, saying this \"may have referred to a general policy that was still secret\" 6. Thus, he suggests something of which he has no proof. Moreover he does this constantly, asking whether Hitler, Himmler and [IMG-8] [8]Heydrich wouldn't have conspired over the Final Solution and kept the more 'lethal' plans for all Europe's Jews secret; again highly speculative inferences considering that the Holocaust progressed in stages., 313596=Evidence for a later starting date is central to Browning's article, \"The Euphoria of Victory and the Final Solution: Summer-Fall 1941 9\". Browning doesn't suggest that Hitler had never previously considered exterminating the Soviet Jews. Indeed he sees this as a reason why so many SS units were at Himmler's disposal once Hitler declared the Soviet Union to be a future German \"Garden of Eden\" 10. However, Browning, unlike Friedlander and Breitman, uses several separate sources to show that the order to kill all Soviet Jews was taken after Operation Barbarosa appeared to be a success. Thus, the first concrete evidence of the decision to consequently apply a Final Solution to all of Europe's Jews is Goring's request to Heydrich to devise a plan for a \"total solution\"., 652018=Stereotyping is a mental activity that is neither natural or necessary; however, due to laziness, upbringing or coincidental experiences (Lester, 1996, p.1), the stereotyping of individuals results in harmful generalisations that ultimately deny an individual's 'unique contribution to humanity' (Lester, 1996, p.1). When the mass media engage in stereotyping, misleading representations concerning members from diverse cultural groups are confirmed.

Possessing an altogether different style to Roosevelt, Stalin viewed Truman as an unpredictable quantity 7. After the Nazi invasion of Russia in 1941, Truman had said: \"If we see that Germany is winning we ought to help Russia, and if Russia is winning we ought to help Germany, and that way let them kill as many as possible although I don't want to see Hitler victorious under any circumstances.\" 8 Roosevelt had apparently kept Truman in the dark about foreign policy issues and Truman was therefore unaware of both the public and private negotiations between Roosevelt and Stalin 9., 266013=[8]Despite the diplomatic tension and suspicion the Western allies were convinced that Russia needed to be kept on side. The war in the Pacific still needed to be won and the Russian promise to declare war on Japan six weeks after the end of the European war was considered vital in bringing about a swift end to the Pacific war. However, by the Potsdam conference in late July, 1945 Truman had been informed of the successful explosion of an atomic weapon on New Mexico - a development that gave him an appreciable confidence in his negotiations with Stalin. 11 Although Potsdam was intended to help to clarify the post-war issues that still remained unresolved, the negations were frustrating and did not progress noticeably on several key issues. Although Stalin had not been officially informed of the US atomic weapons, Truman, Stalin and Churchill were well aware that the unresolved issues were now to be resolved in a nuclear age. 12, 726384=The mass media reinforce images of the aged through stereotyping, which inevitably engender fear among the elderly, labelling them as 'sick' or 'too old' for certain things. In many cases, older men are seen to have power, whereas older women as seen as weak. Such an example can be seen in the instance where an older chairman in an American television commercial was shown preparing to give a speech to his stockholders in a commercial for Coopers and Lybrand in 1993 (Lester, 2996, p. 90). Being an older woman is not so glamorous and well respected. If an older woman is not portrayed as loving grandmother, there is a good chance she will be portrayed as senile., 254295=Paterson TG et al.

The stereotypes served an essential purpose - they justified Anglo enslavement of Africans. Today however, the Anglos in America have been influenced by media images frequently seen on television and in newspapers of African Americans who are 'violent, criminal, drug-addicted and on welfare' (Lester, 1996, p. 21). As in Australia, Aborigines have been given similar treatment, however they have 'expressed deep concern' (Ericksen, 1996, p. 45) about the way they have been represented in the Australian media. Through this, there has been considerably more Aboriginal presence in prime time television, particularly with programs outlining Aboriginal issues such as 'Black Out.' Despite such advancements, regular direct and indirect means of associating Aboriginal persons with criminality, irrational destructiveness and disorder frequently occurs in today's media.

Regarding Jane Eyre. Milsons Point, N.S.W.: Vintage Books, 1997, 87559=Wide Sargasso Sea is the prequel to Jane Eyre; it is Jean Rhys's salvage of the insane Creole woman - Bertha Rochester of Thornfield Hall. Wide Sargasso Sea is typical of many of Rhys's novels, as her preoccupation with the suffering of dependent women is reinforced. The novel is set during a significant period in Jamaica history - the time following the passing of the Emancipation Act of 1838. This was a period of immense racial tension, and Rhys depicts this tension in the mind of young Antoinette Cosway. Antoinette is disturbed by her racial identity, as she is ridiculed for being a \"white cockroach\". As a direct result of her Creole background and upbringing, Antoinette grows up as a misplaced individual. She is a woman who is trapped in her homeland and unable to escape her harsh realities: \"I often wonder who I am and where is my country and where do I belong and why was I ever born at all\" 2. She is often weary of men and she seems to suffer from a kind of sporadic amnesia. 3 Unlike the stable Victorian society of Jane Eyre, Wide Sargasso Sea portrays the racial inequalities apparent in many societies., 260263=During the war the allied leaders were aware that victory in Europe and the Pacific meant much more than just the abolition of an intolerable political regime.

Everyone imposes his own system as far as his army has power to do so.

Young creators working on senior accounts can be a problem, as they do not have the senior's perspective, thus, engaging typically in stereotyping.

It's better to be interested, because that way you can sustain more of the essay and make it more like you're actually saying it rather than..., 249776=In June 1948 the political and economic disputes between the emerging western and eastern blocs became militarised when the threat of direct conflict was used to end the Berlin blockade. The blockade was the result of Soviet concerns over western designs for West Germany, including moves to strengthen it economy and militarily. Russia responded by blockading Berlin, which despite being jointly controlled by a committee of wartime allies, was deep inside Russian East Germany. The suggestion from military advisers that the blockade should be forcefully broken down was rejected and an airlift of aid was used for eleven months. But Truman's warning gesture, of sending B-29 'atomic' bombers to London clearly sent the message that the stakes were higher., 241532=When the political leaders of the three countries met, in early February 1945, the end of the war in Europe was imminent. The Yalta conference sought to settle the allies' apprehensions about the post-war period. Despite President Roosevelt's belief that the \"relations in peacetime should be as strong as they had been in war\" 3 the leaders were nonetheless cautious of the actions and intent of their allies. Soviet officials had often questioned US and British motives in the war, from the appeasement of Hitler to their holding back of a second front 4, and toward the end of the war began to suspect that the US and British diplomats were brokering a separate peace with Nazi leaders. Likewise, Soviet actions in Poland had alarmed the Western allies 5 and the American ambassador to Russia W. Averell Harriman wrote, \"There is every indication the Soviet Union will become a world bully\" 6., 327855=Breitman argues that just because Eichmann and Theodor Dannecker talked of a final solution in early 1941, this meant that they were naturally talking about mass murder. He substantiates this by saying that Heydrich had submitted a proposal to Hitler before the end of January, and thus this must have been the time that the Final Solution was concretely adopted. [IMG-9] [9]However, this contention overlooks that in July 1941, Goring authorised Heydrich to draw up another plan for a \"total solution of the Jewish question\" 7. Considering this request came after the expansion of the Einsatzgruppen's orders to include the killing of all Jews 8, it is more logical to believe that the Final Solution was in fact adopted in mid-1941., 96955=[IMG-1] [1]Jean Rhys's literary success, Wide Sargasso Sea, was published in 1966, more than a century after Charlotte Bronte's famous novel, Jane Eyre. Set during the same era, both novels articulate differing aspects of women's experience during the 19th century. At the time of its publication in 1847, Jane Eyre created quite a stir among the literary world, as it controversially spoke on behalf of women. Charlotte Bronte's novel primarily explores the emancipation of a virtuous young woman, Jane Eyre, who is \"cast in a different mound to the majority\". 1 Jane's significant journey toward selfhood fervently challenged the nineteenth-century acceptance of women's subservient position in society. In contrast, Wide Sargsasso Sea starkly reveals the fate of a disillusioned Creole woman who is powerless and unnerved in post-colonial West Indian society. Jean Rhy's novel articulates some aspects of women's experience that Jane Eyre inevitably suppresses. Whilst Jane's nature is portrayed as unrelenting, Antoinette Cosway is exposed as a white Creole madwoman who is vulnerable and dependent., 325170=[6]If Friedlander is too simplistic, then Breitman, in his article \"Plans for the Final Solution in Early 1941\" 4, gets himself bogged down in events which leads him to draw speculative conclusions. Breitman argues that the Final Solution was finalised in early 1941, if not late 1940, well before the Germans had invaded the Soviet Union. He, like Friedlander, also believes that mass murder was seen as a partial solution to the Jewish question, along with the handicapped one, before the war began. However, Breitman's assertion that these early killings, combined with the ones committed by the Einsatzgruppen during Barbarosa, signified the long-term intentions of Hitler, fails to consider that the orders given to the killing squads initially didn't include the murder of all Jews. 5, 245837=The rhetoric continued to escalate. Stalin made a speech on the eve of the election of the Supreme Soviet which, although not particularly threatening or expansionist were misconstrued by the many analysts, including Justice William Douglas who believed that it was \"the declaration of World War Three\". 13 These comments worried Washington, who requested an explanation and background information on the meaning of the speech from the American ambassador in Moscow, George F. Kennan. Kennan then sent back a 5,540-word telegram to Washington on the 22nd of February 1946, outlining his beliefs that the Soviet Union was a \"political force committed fanatically to the belief that with [the] US there can be no permanent modus vivendi .\" 14 He claimed that the Soviets were \"highly sensitive to the logic of force.\" Kennan's telegram was widely circulated throughout the Washington administration, and was followed soon after by the \"declarations of Cold War\" 15 by Churchill and Stalin. Churchill, now opposition leader in Britain, in his Fulton speech, called for a military alliance between the English-speaking western nations, outside the United Nations, that could resist the \"iron curtain [that] has descended across the continent\" 16. Stalin responded in an interview with the Russian newspaper Pravda saying that Churchill was sowing \"the seeds of dissention among the Allied states\" 17 and that the British opposition leader was the heir of Hitler's racial supremacy beliefs. Stalin said \"Mr. Churchill's position is a war position, a call for war on the U.S.S.R.\" 18, 328939=[IMG-10] [10]Evidence for a later starting date is central to Browning's article, \"The Euphoria of Victory and the Final Solution: Summer-Fall 1941 9\". Browning doesn't suggest that Hitler had never previously considered exterminating the Soviet Jews. Indeed he sees this as a reason why so many SS units were at Himmler's disposal once Hitler declared the Soviet Union to be a future German \"Garden of Eden\" 10. However, Browning, unlike Friedlander and Breitman, uses several separate sources to show that the order to kill all Soviet Jews was taken after Operation Barbarosa appeared to be a success. Thus, the first concrete evidence of the decision to consequently apply a Final Solution to all of Europe's Jews is Goring's request to Heydrich to devise a plan for a \"total solution\"., 30561=Guide to grammar and writing, Capital Community College <grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/>}",
