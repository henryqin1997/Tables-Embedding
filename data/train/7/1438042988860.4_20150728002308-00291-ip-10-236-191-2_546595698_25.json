            "Re: All-New Grand Cherokee in 2010, Chrysler Spending $1.... I agree that the GC is a Suv not a truck based Suv. So are they saying that the new GC will be based off a car? The new GC will have 2 versions and a dodge version. I doubt that the new GC will be car based, more like body on frame based from what I have read in recent months. Look for the 2010 GC to look alot like the tomahawk concept from 2006 Jason",

The Jeep community is a very small proportion of their customer base for anything other than the Wrangler. I doubt the \"Jeep community\" wanted them to build anything with IFS, but they did. The Jeep community definitely didn't want them to get rid of the XJ, but they did. Personally I still think the whole \"car-based\" thing is bunk, put out by some incompetent journalist who doesn't understand that unibody doesn't mean \"car\" and who thinks the current Grand Cherokee is based off a truck platform.
