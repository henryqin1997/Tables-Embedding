            "A collaboration between simulationists and scientists working on fire spread and ecology led to the design of a 3D visualization tool. This tool is a post-processor which can be linked to existing discrete event fire spread models. An object-oriented analysis and design has been retained to produce flexible open source software. The tool developed can produce realistic 3D landscape rendering of fire spread on regular PC. This software is now used in Corsica to help in prospective studies around the region of Montegrosso."

    "textAfterTable": "Paper 7398 (Full Paper) Simulating Process Chain Models with OMNeT++ Author(s) Falko Bause ,Peter Buchholz ,Jan Kriege ,Sebastian Vastag Abstract This paper presents an approach to simulate complex hierarchical process chains resulting from large logistics networks in OMNeT++, a discrete event simulation environment designed for communication networks. For this purpose OMNeT++ has been integrated as a new simulation engine into the ProC/B toolset which is designed for the analysis and optimization of large logistics networks. The paper highlights the main steps of the automatic transformation of a hierarchical process chain model into a hierarchical model in OMNeT++. Furthermore it shows how the transformation has been validated and how detailed performance figures can be evaluated with OMNeT++. Paper 7588 (Full Paper) TOPSU-RDM A Simulation Platform for Railway Delay Management Author(s) Andre Berger ,Ralf Hoffmann ,Ulf Lorenz ,Sebastian Stiller Abstract Delays in a railway network is a common problem that railway companies face in their daily operations. When a train gets delayed, it may either be beneficial to let a connecting train wait so that passengers in the delayed train do not miss their connection, or it may be beneficial to let the connecting train depart on time to avoid further delays. These decisions naturally depend on",
