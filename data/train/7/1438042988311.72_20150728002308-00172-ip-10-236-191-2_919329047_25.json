Also, while in school, have your parents make payments on time in order to remain in school. You will not be able to dorm if payments are not made on time. For the year 2013, my parents and I have agreed that I commute because they could not afford a bill that was due a month ago since my mother has been unemployed since July 2012. My father has always filed taxes under my name as Head of Household and my mother's tax information has been recently added to my FAFSA, so I received a new financial aid award letter. Moreover, not only will you unable to dorm, you will be unable to access your grades, which are only available on the school website, or register for courses the following semester. Since a bill has not been paid in a month, I have a hold on my student account. In addition, if you were awarded as a Duchesne scholar, you must at least complete thirty hours of community service or your scholarship will be delayed and put you in more serious debt. Finally, it is very important that you at least know what you are going to study or have an interest of what you would like to study. You do not plan your major/minor until your sophomore year, so you have time to think. During my first semester, I realized that many students dropped out of classes that they did not need to take in a very short amount of time. I recommend that you take courses that you feel will benefit the career you want to pursue. It is okay to explore different areas because that is what college is about, but it is best to take certain courses that you feel will help you in the future., 109253=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 83096=For the first semester, I took three writing classes, which were First Year Seminar Writing, Creative Writing, and African-American Studies. I had a pretty tough professor for African-American Studies who gave me a lot of criticisms for my essays, but it taught me how to make my essays more argumentative, precise, and comprehensible. Many students had to revise their thesis statement before the professor approved it. In First Year Seminar and Creative Writing, I learned how to improve my grammar, punctuation, and make my responses briefer. Creative Writing and African-American Studies were classes that I was interested in and First Year Seminar is a required course. My point is although First Year Seminar and Creative Writing were courses of interest, they helped me become a better writer. I chose to major in Communications because my parents explained that writing was not going to help me earn enough money. Communications can help me in the Journalism field by not only writing papers, but be seen on television or be heard on the radio. I chose to take Journalism the year of 2013 as well., 60303=Mville begins its celebration in October. We celebrate together the 200 nights before our seniors graduate. We come together as an institution to celebrate our unity and our success through dance, theater, our legendary Halloween Festival, and of course the Haunting of Reed Castle!, 104336=Almost everyone recieves financial aid. The Duchesne Scholarship gives you $2000 to be involved in community service work. There are plenty of on campus jobs as well.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here I enjoy being on that beautiful campus and the activities they have, such as: Fall Fest, Clubs, The Castle Parties, etc. The people on that campus are very nice and outgoing and fun to be around with. Also the volunteer activities they have are fun and enjoyable such as: helping teachers with kinder gardeners, feeding homeless people food in the streets of Harlem, and being a mentor to orphans. Am learning a lot I am learning how to be more independent for myself now since I am a resident on that campus. I also learned interesting art skills that can help me with my major, which is graphic design.
