I can verify that the bug is triggered on my site when using the beta3 and latest dev-version of this module (2012-Mar-26) when removing and uploading an image during the same edit., 100844=Hi jastraat! Current dev version (7.x-1.x-dev dated 2012-Aug-10) does NOT include any of the proposed patches. Are you sure you have applied the patch from #32 manually? If you did, you should have received some kind of error in your log. Can you post it here in a complete form? I'd like to help you, but I need to see the value of $regex. That \"offset 246\" refers to 246th character in $regex variable. And the value of $regex is logged to drupal logs via the function watchdog. BTW you can \"debug\" your problem yourself by adding this to the module's code at line 300 before preg_replace:, 55858=preg_replace(\"/(https:\\/\\/localhost\\/system\\/files\\/geogallery\\/%5Bcurrent-page%3Aurl%3Aargs%3A1%5D\\/pic_2011-02-18_1921.jpg|\\/system\\/files\\/geogallery\\/%5Bcurrent-page%3Aurl%3Aargs%3A1%5D\\/pic_2011-02-18_1921.jpg|private:\\/\\/)(styles\\/.*?\\/private\\/|)(geogallery\\/[current-page:url:args:1]\\/pic_2011-02-18_1921.jpg)/e\", \"_filefield_paths_replace_path_uri_scheme('\\1', 'private://geogallery/[current-page:url:args:1]/pic_2011-02-18_1921.jpg', 'private://geogallery/pic_2011-02-18_1921.jpg') .

The PHP error generated is unfortunately destroying all text content within the node however, so this rather critical.
