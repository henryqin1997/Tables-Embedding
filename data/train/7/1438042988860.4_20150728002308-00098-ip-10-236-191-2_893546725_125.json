            "The school is just minutes away from Busch Gardens and Adventure Island. Also, you can hop on 275 and be in Ybor City within 15-20 minutes to hit the good clubs. You CAN'T miss Guavaween around Halloween.",
            "Being in the heart of North Tampa, there are plenty of places to eat if you don't feel like eating on campus. The campus food isn't that bad either.",
            "The dorms are nice, for college dorms. lol Florida requires that all first year students live on campus, so be prepared for that. Other than that, it's pretty good.",
            "If you are driven, then you can definitely find your niche here. USF is a very good school. Like any other university, if you slack off, then you're not going to succeed, but if you apply yourself, then you will do well.",
            "Go on the campus tour first. It is a very large school, so it can seem very daunting at first.",
            "This is a beautiful campus. They have several colleges onsite and many opportunities. Also, the Moffitt Cancer Center is there, which provides for a wonderful learning opportunity by itself."

This along with federal aid will really diminish the need for loans!, 529412=Humans versus Zombies is a staple of the campus in October for Halloween. It's a week long, campus-wide, game of tag essentially. It happens once every semester and is one of the most fun events I've ever participated in/watched!, 750471=There's a really cool sundial type thing with a meteorite in the middle of it, and on the summer solstice at 1:12 pm the circle above casts a shadow perfectly onto the circle in the center., 1116083=Food in the Argos, Andros, and Juniper/Poplar areas have ok food. Their food changes all the time but has sections that are always constant like sandwiches and pizza. The Marshall student center has a subway, panda express, chick-fil-a, and an organic section. After spring break of 2013 a pollo tropical is going to be on campus., 532688=The classes are consistent with whatever level you sign up for (1000 to 4000). Even if the course material is difficult, the professors are VERY accessible, as well as are the free tutor services and learning centers., 579975=The bathrooms are all cleaned regularly, the Juniper-Poplar Hall was just built in 2009, and there are always constant get togethers and fun activities on each floor., 176636=Apply early and be persistent. USF has not traditionally turned applicants away but this has changed over the past few years. Not everyone gets accepted anymore. Entrance requirements like GPA and SAT are really important so take the time to earn a high GPA and study for the SAT. Also, the university offers millions of dollars in scholarships to new students but you have to apply for them several months before the school year starts. Start looking into scholarships as early as October of the year before because their deadlines are often in the spring and long before the school year begins. Make some friends who are already at the university since they can give you specific tips on who to go to if you have an issue during the application process. It's easy to get lost in a big state university system so be diligent and take everything seriously. You'll have plenty of fun once you're accepted.}",

Students who love having fun just as much as learning. Students who are open to try new things. Tips for prospective students Get involved ASAP. The sooner you get involved, the easier it is. Try new things and be open minded. Oh yea, study hard and make your classes top priority. Enjoy this time in your life. You get back as much as you put in. Bang for the buck Tuition is going up, and USF recognizes that. The fees included in tuition do not begin to cover what you can receive from this school. There are SO many free things around campus. If you pay attention, you can usually find free food\u2026daily. There are so many activities and events that are free to you just for being a proud BULL! Things such as awesome concerts, shows,",
