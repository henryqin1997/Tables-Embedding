    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{13766=Lately I\u2019ve been frustrated by the radio on my commute to work. I hear the same songs over and over again\u2013 and I\u2019m not even good at singing along with any of them. That\u2019s why I was fascinated by an article from The New Yorker titled \u201cThe Song Machine The Hitmakers behind Rihanna\u201d. As it turns out, a relatively small number of producers and top-liners create a disproportionately large share of contemporary hits (Top Forty radio) which helps explain why so many of them sound similar. Apparently in 2009, both Beyonc\u00e9 and Kelly Clarkson had hits (Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cHalo\u201d and Clarkson\u2019s \u201cAlready Gone\u201d) that were created from the same track, by Ryan Tedder. To make these songs, the producer runs the session and serves as creative director of the song, while the top-liner works on the lyrics and hooks. Basically a Producer works to create a successful project, guiding the creative vision from start to finish., 9443=The average yearly salary for a Film/TV Producer ranges between $29,921 \u2013 $102,184. In 2009, TV Producer Producers earned a median annual salary of $66,720. The average yearly salary for a Music Producer ranges between $17,764 \u2013 $106,681. From there you could go on to become an Audio Engineer ($20,628 \u2013 $84,306 on average per year), a Producer/Director TV/Cable Broadcast ($25,107 \u2013 $98,364 on average per year), a Film/Video Editor ($23,387 \u2013 $97,330 on average per year), or an Executive Producer Television Productions ($39,288 \u2013 $193,470 on average per year).}",
