For example, if you want to block a learned pattern with prefix 235 from remote call-control entity, xyz with IP address of 111.11.11.11, you can block the pattern specifically for this call-control entity by entering the relevant information in the Block Learned Patterns window; in this example, after you save the configuration, the CCD requesting service searches the local cache and purges the learned patterns with 235 prefix from remote call-control entity xyz with IP address of 111.11.11.11. Any subsequent notifications with this information gets blocked and ignored by Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Be aware that blocking and purging of patterns is based on exact match; for example, configuring 235XX blocks 235XX, not any subsets of that pattern. Be aware that if you do not specify a remote call-control entity and IP address for the entity, Cisco Unified Communications Manager purges and blocks the pattern for all remote call-control entities that use it.}",
