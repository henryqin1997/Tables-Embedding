Primitive solids can be grouped into compound objects, and multiple instances of a compound object can be used in further designs. Geometric relations between primitives and instances are specified by geometric constraints between their local coordinate systems., 322726=It will be seen from the above that the mapping function M is a function of the variable I, and that I is equal to both the number of the ith polygon and also the index of the base into which the polygon is to be placed (as one polygon is placed in each base so there is a 1:1 relationship). As a result, each polygon is generated in accordance with the value of I of its containing base.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Classifications Having thus described several aspects of at least one embodiment of this invention, it is to be appreciated various alterations, modifications, and improvements will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Such alterations, modifications, and improvements are intended to be part of this disclosure, and are intended to be within the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the foregoing description and drawings are by way of example only. The nature of the bases and content objects described above are specific to the example described, whereas base generator 70 and content generator 90 are operable to generate a wide variety of bases and content objects. For example, in the example described above, one backbone base is generated for each floor of the building\u2014in the centre of the floor with ring bases around it. However, in the case of a square or rectangular building, base generator 70 is operable to generate a backbone base at each corner of each floor. Of course, other bases and content objects can be generated depending upon the application and design. In the embodiment described above, content creator 94 employs geometric modelling kernels that are pre-stored in apparatus 2 in order to create content objects. However, in addition or instead, content creator 94 may be arranged to download modelling kernels from a separate apparatus, at the time when the modelling kernels are required. Furthermore, content creator",
