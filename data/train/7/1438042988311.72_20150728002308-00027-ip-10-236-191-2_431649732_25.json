Shahadat - who's also known as \"Rajib\" - has all the necessary attributes for a successful seam bowler, bar outright pace. He is tall, comes in off a smooth run-up, and doesn't put unnecessary pressure on his body with a slightly open-chested delivery position. He has a strong frame, endurance in abundance, and the ability to move the ball both ways. He is also naturally aggressive, with a characteristic grunt at the delivery stride., 65623=His Test debut at Lord's in 2005 was a chastening experience, as he conceded 101 runs in just 12 overs, but his second visit was a far happier affair, despite Bangladesh's defeat on the fifth day of the game. On the tour to Zimbabwe in July 2006, Hossain became the first Bangladeshi to take a hat-trick in one-day internationals. His 6 for 27 against the South Africa in 2008 is his best Test performance to date. He has struggled for consistency, however, especially in ODIs, and hasn't yet been able to cement his place in the side . Rabeed Imam and Cricinfo Staff May 2010, 34283=Born August 7, 1986, Dhaka, 85191=4391 runs after 35, and 2354 outside top five, 81548=Numbers Game: Since 2009, teams batting first have a win-loss ratio which is 61% higher than it was between 2000 and 2008, 69306=May 6, 2015, 64397=When Shahadat Hossain was discovered during a talent-spotting camp in Narayanganj, and whisked away to the Bangladesh Institute of Sports (BKSP) for refinement, few would have predicted that he would become the first Bangladeshi cricketer to have his name etched on the honours board at Lord's. Yet that was exactly what transpired when, in Bangladesh's second Test tour of England in 2010, he picked up 5 for 98 in England's first innings of the first Test at Lord's., 70917=Oct 27, 2014}",
