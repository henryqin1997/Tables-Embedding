When I visited, I absolutely loved it; Everyone was really friendly and seemed authentically interested in me and my plans. I would highly recommend!, 38081=So much! We have free movie nights at our local movie theater. Donut runs at 1:00 am. (Best donuts ever) Many organizations and clubs for everyone!, 125718=The biggest tradition that Otterbein has is 'donut runs'. There is a bakery in Uptown Westerville that opens at 1:30AM during the week, It's great after a long night of studying to run up to Schneider's and grab a fresh donut and a carton of milk for only $1!, 197484=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
