Not two. But, three rainouts, pushing the season total to 25. To place that in perspective, at the same point last season there was just 8, and the record number for this point over the last decade was 28 in 2007., 207734=See the table below for each game rained out so far in the 2011 season., 206855=The league is taking an attendance hit, and teams will be playing more double-headers due to the high number if rainouts. As of yesterday, the league has seen 12 rainouts. To place this in perspective, there were just\u00a0the two rainouts for all of April last season. By the 19th of April of 2010 there were no rainouts., 206755=They say April showers bring May flowers, but Major League Baseball could use more sunshine., 133296=3:45 PM Start - 98%!, 195362=Monday evening, April 25, 2011, an employee of the Yankees sent an e-mail to several hundred Yankees Season Ticket Licensees. The e-mail mistakenly attached an internal Yankees spreadsheet that listed the following information associated with your New York Yankees account:, 45442=Welcome to the 2011 Business of Sports Network Autism Challenge, 207203=There have been 3 days where more than one game has been rained out (April 12, 16, and 19) with the 12th seeing three games postponed due to poor weather., 149674=If there\u2019s a song dancing in Bud Selig\u2019s head today, it\u2019s surely that children's nursery rhyme. Wednesday saw two more rainouts in Major League Baseball, bringing the total up to 21 for the 2011 season, which is just shy of a month-and-a-half old. And that didn\u2019t include the rain delay for the Cards-Cubs game that gave a national television audience on ESPN something to chat about as winds and lightening came with the deluge., 135249=2:20 PM Start, 53510=It\u2019s taken a while, but the national media is starting to take notice that rainouts this year are skewing the early 2011 attendance total (well, rainouts and the Dodgers, if you want to be exact)., 130944=Here\u2019s the breakout for Thurs, May 12., 207572=And remember, this doesn\u2019t account for rain delays. MLB is sure to point to some of this as a key reason for the attendance drop early in the 2011 season., 130142=Another day, another rainout. For the second day in a row, and 22 since the season started on March 31, a game was postponed due to weather. The impact may not ultimately be the key driver in an attendance decline, but consider this: many, if not most, of the games are made up later in the season as part of double-headers. With teams running on fumes at that stage, adding in the extra games will tax rotations.}",

And, it gets worse. The Dodgers, who have been fighting attendance woes all season barely cracked 35,000 on a night when there were discounted tickets. The Nationals, had a dollar night promo that had just over 50 percent sell-thru (granted, the Nats were playing the Pirates). And finally, the A\u2019s woes at the gate continued with attendance just cracking the 11,000 mark. You get the sense that all around the league, execs are looking up at the calendar and praying for Memorial Day to arrive. Here\u2019s Monday\u2019s breakdown.
