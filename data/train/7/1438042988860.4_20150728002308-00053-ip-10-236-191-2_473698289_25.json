The HCl salt did not dissolve completely in the organic solvents of these solvent-based adhesives, and the final dried casts contained visible solid drug crystals in the adhesive matrix. A matrix system with Buspirone HCl at 1% or 2% (w/w) was prepared in a comparable water-based acrylic copolymer adhesive dispersion, NACOR 72-9965. The HCl salt dissolved completely in this water-based adhesive dispersion, and the dried adhesive matrix was visibly free of drug crystals. The results of in vitro skin flux experiments using these systems are summarized in Tables 3-5., 109571=A transdermal buspirone delivery device was prepared using buspirone hydrochloride salt according to the technique described in WO 97/37659 (Example 3) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,633,009 (Example 1). This approach is based on the premise that all salts of the base compound are included in the term buspirone (U.S. Pat. No. 5,633,009 at Col. 8, Lines 23-25). Buspirone hydrochloride (0.70 g) was added to 9.2 g of acetone (99.5%+; Aldrich; Milwaukee, Wis.). The hydrophilic buspirone hydrochloride salt did not completely dissolve in this solvent. The buspirone hydrochloride/acetone mixture was combined with 6.1 g of isocetyl alcohol (Condea-Vista; Austin, Tex.). The hydrophilic buspirone hydrochloride did not completely dissolve in this mixture. The buspirone hydrochloride/acetone/isocetyl alcohol mixture was blended with a commercial organic solvent-based PIB adhesive (MA-24, Adhesives Research, Glen Rock, Pa.). The hydrophilic buspirone hydrochloride also did not completely dissolve in this mixture. The buspirone hydrochloride/acetone/isocetyl alcohol/PIB adhesive mixture was cast on a release coated polymer film (Rexam Release Technologies, W. Chicago, Ill.) to obtain a dried coating weight of approximately 10 mg/ml. This film was dried at 60\ufffd C. in a convection oven for 30 minutes and the dried film was laminated to a polyester film laminate (SCOTCHPACK #1012, 3M Pharmaceuticals; St. Paul, Minn.). The composition of the dried pressure sensitive adhesive matrix film was PIB adhesive/buspirone hydrochloride/isocetyl alcohol 86/1.5/12.5% (w/w)., 161562=Lidocaine is an analgesic drug that is pharmaceutically approved in both the hydrophilic hydrochloride salt form and the hydrophobic free base forms. Pressure sensitive matrix systems with lidocaine free base and lidocaine HCl were prepared in an organic solvent-based hydrophobic acrylic copolymer adhesive, DURO-TAK 2516, at concentrations equivalent to 1% (w/w) of the HCl salt. The free base dissolved easily in the organic solvent solution and the resulting dried matrix was visibly free of drug crystals. The HCl salt did not dissolve completely in the organic solvent-based adhesive, and the final dried cast contains visible solid drug crystals in the adhesive matrix. A matrix system with lidocaine HCl at 1% (w/w) was also prepared in a comparable water-based acrylic adhesive, NACOR 72-9965. The dried matrix produced using the salt and the water-based adhesive dispersion was physically stable and free of drug crystals. The results of in vitro skin flux experiments using these systems are summarized in Table 12., 61575=Cell envelope disordering compounds are known in the art as being useful in topical pharmaceutical preparations. A comprehensive list of these compounds is set forth in European Patent Application 43,738, published Jun. 13, 1982, which is incorporated herein by reference. Examples of cell envelope disordering compounds that can be used as enhancers, without limitation, include saturated and unsaturated fatty acids and their esters, alcohols, monoglycerides, acetates, diethanolamides, and N,N-dimethylamides, such as oleic acid, propyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, glycerol monooleate, glycerol monolaurate, methyl laurate, lauryl alcohol, lauramide diethanolamide, and mixtures thereof. Saturated and unsaturated sorbitan esters, such as sorbitan monooleate and sorbitan monolaurate, can also be used. It is believed that any cell envelope disordering compound is useful for purposes of this invention., 36266=This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09/149,523 filed Sep. 8, 1998 now abandoned, which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 08/706,624 filed Sep. 6, 1996 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,985,317., 75529=Buspirone is an azapirone anxiolytic drug, and the FDA-approved form of the drug is the hydrochloride (HCl) salt. Pressure sensitive adhesive systems were prepared using the methods described above with buspirone hydrochloride and buspirone free base in several different adhesives: (1) MA-24 (Adhesives Research, Glen Rock, Pa.), an organic solvent-based PIB adhesive; (2) PIB-500 (Lord Corporation, Pompano Beach, Fla.), a comparable water-based PIB; (3) DUROTAK 2979 (National Starch and Chemical Company, Bridgewater, N.J.), an organic solvent-based acrylic adhesive; (4) NACOR 72-9965 (National Starch and Chemical Company), a comparable water-based acrylic. In each case, the drug substance was mixed with the liquid adhesive in quantities sufficient to obtain a concentration of 5% (w/w) drug in the dried film after film casting., 136090=Transdermal patches with 10% ketorolac (on a free acid basis) were prepared with ketorolac tromethamine salt according to the procedure described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,589,498 (Example 2). This approach is based on the premise that all pharmaceutically accepted salts of the ketorolac free acid compound are included in the term ketorolac (U.S. Pat. No.5,589,498 at Col. 4, Lines 46-51). Ketorolac tromethamine salt (2.10 g) was added to 0.56 g of propylene glycol (Sigma, Lot #27H1179) and 0.56 g isopropyl myristate (Nikko Chemicals, Lot #4123). The mixture was added to 32.6 g of a pressure sensitive acrylic copolymer adhesive in an organic solution (DURO-TAK 2852, formerly DURO-TAK 9852; National Starch and Chemical, 33.5% solids). The solution was left to mix for 12 hours on a rolling mill. The ketorolac tromethamine does not dissolve in the enhancer-acrylic adhesive solution. The drug-enhancer-adhesive mixture was then cast on SCOTCHPAK 1012 polyester backing (3M, Lot 138) with a 40 mil (1,016 \u03bcm) casting knife. The solvent in the adhesive solution was evaporated at room temperature for 30 minutes and then in an oven at 100\ufffd C. for 15 minutes. The resulting adhesive film was laminated to a release liner (SCOTCHPAK #1022, Lot 640). The resulting transdermal laminate was cut into 0.71 cm2 disks for in vitro evaluation. The resulting transdermal laminate was visibly cloudy and extensive crystals were visible upon microscopic examination., 108006=A transdermal buspirone delivery device was prepared using buspirone free base according to the technique described in WO 97/37659 (Example 3) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,633,009 (Example 1). Buspirone free base (0.70\ufffd0.01 g) was dissolved in 9.20 g of a prior art solvent (acetone, 99.5%+; Aldrich; Milwaukee, Wis.). This buspirone free base solution was combined with 6.1\ufffd0.01 g of isocetyl alcohol (Condea-Vista; Austin, Tex.). The buspirone free-base/acetone/isocetyl alcohol mixture was blended with a commercial organic solution PIB adhesive (MA-24, Adhesives Research, Glen Rock, Pa.). The buspirone free base/acetone/isocetyl alcohol/PIB adhesive mixture was cast on a release coated polymer film (Rexam Release Technologies; W. Chicago, Ill.) to obtain a dried coating weight of approximately 10 mg/ml. This film was dried at 60\ufffd C. in a convection oven for 30 minutes and the dried film was laminated to a polyester film laminate (SCOTCHPACK #1012, 3M Pharmaceuticals; St. Paul, Minn.). The composition of the dried pressure sensitive adhesive matrix was PIB adhesive/buspirone free base/isocetyl alcohol 86/1.5/12.5% (w/w)., 59315=These particle dispersions are typically formed by emulsion polymerization of water insoluble monomers. D. Satas, Acrylic Adhesives, in Handbook of Pressure Sensitive Adhesives 435 (D. Satas ed., 2d ed., 1989). As a result, these systems are typically called aqueous emulsion pressure sensitive adhesives, although strictly speaking the polymerized system is no longer an emulsion since the disperse phase is no longer a liquid. Examples of such emulsion polymerized adhesives include hydrophobic acrylic copolymer adhesives (e.g. National Starch NACOR 72-9965, Monsanto GELVA 2484, Morton International MORSTICK 214, and Rohm & Haas ROBOND PS-20), ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer adhesives (e.g. National Starch EVA-TAK 33-4060), or styrene-butadiene rubber adhesives (e.g. National Starch NACOR 72-8725, and Dow Latex PSA 578A). Pressure sensitive adhesives can also be obtained by compounding emulsion-polymerized dispersions of hydrophobic elastomeric polymers (e.g. BASF ACRONAL A217) with tackifiers that are water soluble (e.g. polyvinylmethyl ether; BASF LUTONAL M40) or that are water insoluble particle dispersions in water (e.g. polyvinylisobutyl ether; BASF LUTONAL I 65 D)., 134178=Transdermal patches with 10% ketorolac free acid were prepared according to the procedure described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,589,498 (Example 2). Ketorolac free acid (1.65 g) was added to 0.64 g of propylene glycol (Sigma, Lot #27H1179) and 0.67 g isopropyl myristate (Nikko Chemicals, Lot #4123). The mixture was added to 41.05 g of a pressure sensitive acrylic copolymer adhesive in an organic solution (DURO-TAK 2852, formerly DURO-TAK 9852; National Starch and Chemical, Lot 7898-117-1, 33.5% solids). The solution was left to mix for 12 hours on a rolling mill. The ketorolac acid-enhancer-adhesive mixture formed a homogeneous solution. The drug-enhancer-adhesive mixture was then cast on SCOTCHPAK 1012 polyester backing film (3M, Lot #138) with a 40 mil (1,016 \u03bcm) casting knife. The solvent in the adhesive solution was evaporated at room temperature for 30 minutes and then in an oven at 100\ufffd C. for 15 minutes. The resulting adhesive film was laminated to a release liner (SCOTCHPAK #1022, Lot 640). The resulting transdermal laminate was cut into 0.71 cm2disks for in vitro evaluation. The adhesive matrix was visibly homogeneous and free from crystals upon microscopic examination.}",
