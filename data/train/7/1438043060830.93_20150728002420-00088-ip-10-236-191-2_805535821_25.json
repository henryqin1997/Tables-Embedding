    "textBeforeTable": "P3P schemas may refer to the following primitive data element types: 4.2 Primitive Data Types Analogously to P3P policies, an essential requirement on dataschemas is the immutability of dataschemas: with one exception, dataschemas that can be fetched at a certain URI cannot be changed. \u00a0This way, the URI of a policy acts like a unique identifier for the dataschema, and usually any new dataschema must therefore use a new different URI. The only exception to this general principle is when multiple language versions (translations) of the same dataschema are offered by the server using the HTTP \"Content-Language\" tag to properly indicate that a particular language encoding has been used for the dataschema. P3P clients MAY check for immutability of dataschemas, by comparing a cached version of a dataschema (and its Content-Language if present) with the corresponding freshly retrieved dataschema (and Content-Language if present). If a user agent discovers that the two dataschemas are different but retain the same URI, then it MUST treat the resource referencing the changed dataschema as if it has no P3P policy, UNLESS the dataschemas have two different values of their Content-Language. 4.1 Immutability of Dataschemas Note that the data element names specified in the base data schema or in extension data schemas may be used for purposes other than P3P policies. For example, web sites may use these names to label HTML form fields. By referring to data the same way in",

All P3P-compliant user agent implementations MUST be aware of the Basic Data Types. Each table below specifies the elements of a basic data type, the categories associated, their types, and the display names shown to users. More than one category may be associated with a fixed data element. However, each base data element is assigned to only one category whenever possible. Data schema designers are recommended to do the same. 4.3.1 Dates The date. type is a structured type that specifies a date. Since date information can be used in different ways, depending on the context, all date. information is tagged as being of \"variable\" category. Schema definitions have to explicitly set the corresponding category in the element referencing this data type. For example, soliciting the birthday of a user might be \"Demographic and Socioeconomic Data\", while the expiration date of a credit card belongs to the \"Financial Account Identifiers\" category. date.
