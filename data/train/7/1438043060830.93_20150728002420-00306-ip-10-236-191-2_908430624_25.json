            "The campus is very safe.",
            "This is basically nonexistent on campus but there is interest building so that could change quickly.",
            "There is plenty to be involved with on campus and this is always changing. Students can create their own club or activity if they want to. There is always something that one can be participating in.",
            "Good for a small campus environment. The small population allows for more personal leadership opportunities or other opportunities in general.",
            "I think that the school is worth it for what you pay. It is considerably cheaper than some other in state schools but in some ways you are getting what you pay for. It is not a traditional college in many ways.",
            "There are numerous restaurants and/or activities to do off campus. The life on campus isn't too exciting. Student Life does a nice job of trying to provide activities for students to participate in.",
            "Food isn't that great. The cafeteria is a little costly for what it is, but the ala carte style of dining can be nice for some people.",
            "Campus population itself is small. The dorms are nice, though. The suite style dorm set up works well.",
            "The class sizes are small and the professor are easy to get in contact with making coursework, projects, etc easy to complete and easy to get help on. Professors and Academic Professionals on campus are willing to help anyone.",
            "-the campus has a small population of on campus students, most are commuters or online students. -it is in a more suburban setting, anything you want to do is within driving distance",
            "Overall friendly and welcoming environment on campus. UIS allows students to explore their interests and get a college experience without having to pay too much."

There is also a coffee shop that is comparable to a Starbucks or other coffee shop. Both of the dorms have small food vendors in them. One focuses on fast food type food and is open until midnight. The other focuses on health food and has a variety of hours. The only thing that is not convenient about the dining is the strange hours on the weekends with the places opening at 11:30 am, closing at 2 pm, then reopening at 3 pm and closing at 6 pm., 149318=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
