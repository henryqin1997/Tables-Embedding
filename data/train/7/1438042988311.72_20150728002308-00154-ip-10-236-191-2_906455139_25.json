            "There are a lot of options (including vegan and vegetarian), but my favorite part is the sustainability. They use local farmers and producers, which keeps the food fresh and good for the environment. The first year, a meal plan is required, but you get to use the dinning hall as much as you like.",
            "Most of Colgate's students live on campus. I think this is because campus housing is guaranteed, which makes it so much easier for students. The best part of housing, at least compared to other schools, is the the wonderful gender inclusive housing. The dorms are small (but aren't all dorms?). There are suites, doubles and singles. There are laundry and study/lounge rooms within the buildings.",
            "The core curriculum is designed to challenge students in many disciplines beyond their major. As such, some courses are hard for some and easy for others. I like how you have to take a variety of classes like Legacies of the Ancient World and the Science of Art. There really is something for everyone. In addition to classes, Colgate offers a lot of research opportunities, which is extremely beneficial."

When you graduate you will march down with the torches., 64449=Some good places to go to get away from campus are the quarry behind campus and the Yurt, which is a short drive away. We often go to the quarry to build a fire and make smores but you can actually rent out the Yurt for about $20 a night and sleep there with a bunch of people. Colgate's Spring Party Weekend in April is a famous four-day celebration funded by the school and the frats where students can unwind before finals and listen to some awesome concerts., 134992=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 18745=Come during April Visit Days and eat a chipwich - it's a tradition! Also check out the athletic trails on top of the hill - the views are great!, 97533=We have a torchlight march up the hill during freshman orientation and another down the hill at graduation., 115842=Frank dining hall has a lot of variety but it can get old very quickly.

    "textAfterTable": "Colgate is a great place to go to college. There is no denying the fact that it is rural and isolated, but I haven't had any problems with life on campus. There are so many students interest groups and events on campus that everyone stays busy and the isolation isn't really noticable. Also, between school organizations and the Greek organizations there are always musicians coming to campus: everything from up and coming bands to headliners. Am learning a lot I came to Colgate with a pretty narrow idea of what I wanted to study and what I wanted out of my collegiate career. Colgate has, however, reshaped my ideas about the potential of a college education. I thought that both the core program and the distribution requirements would be a nuisance, but I have actually discovered a wide range of interests that I probably would not have explored had these programs not been a vital part of the Colgate experience. I am able to focus on, and engross myself with, my major but can also study a broad range of other interesting subjects.
