    "textBeforeTable": "US Market Shares, RPMs, Q3 2009 The Reality of Airline Market Dominance When is a market 'dominated' by one (or more than one) airline(s) and when is a marketplace fairly competitive? We quote the generally accepted definitions of oligopolies and monopolies in part one of this article series.\u00a0 Basically, any time four (or sometimes more; and of course, definitely if fewer) companies have 50% or more of a market, this is probably an oligopoly, and if these four (or fewer) companies control more than 80% of the market, it is most likely a monopoly (even though more than one company is present). US market statistics So how do the US airlines stack up against this measure? Using the excellent Bureau of Transportation Statistics, we see the following results for US airlines :",
    "textAfterTable": "\u00a0 The four largest carriers have 60.1% of the total market (in terms of passenger miles flown) and so, on the face of it, seem to be in an oligopolistic situation. Interestingly, if the merger between Northwest and Delta had not been allowed to proceed, the four largest carriers would then be AA, DL, UA and CO, with a 51.8% market share between them - right on the cusp of becoming an oligopoly.\u00a0 The DL/NW merger, between the formerly second and sixth largest carriers (as measured by passenger miles flown) has now cemented the assumption in place that the airline industry is oligopolistic. The previous major merger - between US Airways and America West - resulted in the new merged carrier taking the sixth place on this list.\u00a0 There is also a secondary measure of oligopolistic markets that looks at the market share belonging to the eight largest competitors - so this merger concentrated more power in the eight largest airlines, while not affecting the market power of the four largest airlines. A mooted future merger between United and Continental, should it subsequently occur, would combine the third and fourth largest carriers, moving Southwest up to the fourth slot, and would therefore concentrate 69.3% of the market into the top four carriers.\u00a0 This would definitely tilt the market appreciably further towards being severely oligopolistic.",
