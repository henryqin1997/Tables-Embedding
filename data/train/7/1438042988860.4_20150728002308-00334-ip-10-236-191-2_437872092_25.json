    "textAfterTable": "John P. Holland, San Jose, CA US Patent application number Description Published 20080206483 PLASMA PROCESS FOR INDUCTIVELY COUPLING POWER THROUGH A GAS DISTRIBUTION PLATE WHILE ADJUSTING PLASMA DISTRIBUTION - A method of processing a workpiece in the chamber of a plasma reactor having a ceiling overlying the workpiece by introducing a process gas into the chamber through a gas distribution plate in the ceiling. The gas is introduced by distributing gas flow from a first gas input to plural gas distribution orifices extending through a manifold of the gas distribution plate, and distributing gas flow from each of the plural gas distribution orifices to plural gas injection orifices in a showerhead of the gas distribution plate. The method further includes restricting gas flow in the gas distribution plate to paths having arcuate lengths about an axis of symmetry less than a complete circle. The method also includes capacitively and inductively coupling plasma source power into the chamber through the gas distribution. The method further includes adjusting the plasma ion density radial distribution in the process region by adjusting the ratio between the amounts of the capacitively coupled VHF power and the inductively coupled power. 08-28-2008 20080230008 PLASMA SPECIES AND UNIFORMITY CONTROL THROUGH PULSED VHF OPERATION - An apparatus for processing a substrate has a chamber, a high frequency power source, and a low frequency power source. The chamber has a first and second electrode disposed therein. The high",
