            "Every once in a while, you will here about a fight or something that happened, but majority of the school year, you will be fine.",
            "I'm not Greek, but from what is viewed, it is fine. They used to be really fun to watch, and i have friends that are Greek as well. But, as the years gone by, they basically are not the center of attention anymore.",
            "Grambling has a wide range of clubs that you can join. They have interest meetings all the time to join a club. You just have to remind yourself to look or ask around for them.",
            "If you are an Athlete, In the Band or in the Choir, (I REPEAT) COME TO GRAMBLING!!!. They look out for you guys (ex, Scholarships, Fee Waivers, etc.). I'm sorry to say that the rest of the students just have to find ways to get ADDITIONAL money.",
            "Homecoming is the best! The Alumni comes and like BOMBARDS that campus; its too funny!. But it's like when they do come, you realize the REAL tradition of Grambling and you get high hopes to to Graduate and meet up with your College buddies and hang out like they do around this time.",
            "Basically, Visit the school in high school. Get registered EARLY; so you do not have to face out DEADLY financial aid center. Highlights of the school year: Football games, Homecoming, Cotton Bowl, Bayou Classic, Mardi Gras, Springfest, & Graduation (in that order, until you graduate). Stay focus and dont believe the Illusion; Or Else Grambling will chew you up and spit you right out. Our motto, Where everybody is a Somebody...(with a fee sheet) is true and you will believe it when you get here.",
            "Hang out with friends. Go to a party every once and a while or just go to one of the events that's happening on campus. What I was told when I was a freshman was that you create your own fun.",
            "The food is okay. The cafeteria has there days. Sometimes its horrible, but other times its just what you have been dreaming about or have a taste for.",
            "It all depends on WHERE you live. Some dorms are nice, but are noisy because of the people that also live in the same dorm. While traditional dorms are what you make of it and is a SUPER quiet area to live and study.",
            "The majority of the classes are fine; some are even easy. You can choose a variety of classes early or late. Most teachers tell you just come to class everyday & you wont fail; while others, you have to work your tail off just to get a C.",
            "Visit the School BEFORE you attend; your Senior year of high school. Get REGISTERED before school starts. And, have an idea of what you want to do AFTER College so you wont lose focus DURING College.",
            "I rate Grambling at about a 7. The beginning is great. You meet new people & have a different feel in the atmosphere."

But there are emergency stations all around campus just in case. Great for these types of students African American Students, International Students, Social Work Majors Bang for the buck If you choose Grambling State University as your college, you will not be sorry. Even with some downfalls, the good outweighs the bad. And as regards to the typical amount being around 7,000 a semester, its a cheap college with high quality. What to do for fun For fun, most of the time depending on which day of the week that it is, Grambling will already have something planned on campus. but do NOT forget homecoming week or the bayou classic, you have to experience them. Food and Dining In the cafeteria, there are many choices throughout the day, If you do not want one thing, you have the option of selecting another. If you get bored like I did with the cafe selections, then using your tiger bucks will come in handy for you,",
