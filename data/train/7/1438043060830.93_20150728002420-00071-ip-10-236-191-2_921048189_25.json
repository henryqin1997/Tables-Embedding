The Commission seeks to develop a flexible and streamlined regulatory framework that will encourage efficient, innovative uses of the spectrum and to allow various services to operate on an interference-protected basis. In doing so, it further seeks to adopt service rules that will allow for the deployment of the various radar applications in this band, both within and outside the U.S. The Commission takes this action in response to a petition for rulemaking filed by Robert Bosch, LLC (Bosch) and two petitions for reconsideration of the 2012 Vehicular Radar R&O., 33022=Title 47 published on 2014-10-01, 24389=In this document the Commission implements certain changes to the rules governing the 700 MHz public safety narrowband spectrum (769-775/799-805 MHz). We eliminate the requirement for licensees to narrowband to 6.25 kHz technology by December 2016, thereby enabling licensees to extend the life of existing systems and providing public safety with greater flexibility in determining the optimal future use of the band. In addition, we revise and update the technical rules for the band to enhance interoperability and open up certain channels to new uses, and we release reserve spectrum to provide additional capacity, particularly for public safety licensees relocating to the 700 MHz band from the T-Band (470-512 MHz). These rule changes enhance the ability of public safety licensees to use this spectrum to protect the safety of life and property., 29916=The Federal Communications Commission (Commission) announces that a certain rule adopted in its Public Safety 700 MHz Narrowband proceeding (WT Docket No. 96-86; FCC 00-348 and FCC 01-10) between 2000 and 2001, to the extent it contained an information collection requirement that required approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) was approved, and became effective August 21, 2014, following approval by OMB.}",

Effective August 6, 2015. 47 CFR Parts 1, 2, 25, 27, 74, 78, 80, 87, 90, 97, and 101 Summary In this document, the Commission implemented allocation changes from the World Radiocommunication Conference (Geneva, 2007) (WRC-07) and updated related service rules. The Commission took this action in order to conform its rules, to the extent practical, to the decisions that the international community made at WRC-07. This action will promote the advancement of new and expanded services and provide significant benefits to the American people. In addition, the Commission revised the International Table of Frequency Allocations within its rules to generally reflect the allocation changes made at the World Radiocommunication Conference (Geneva, 2012) (WRC-12). 2015-06-23; vol. 80 # 120 - Tuesday, June 23, 2015 80 FR 36164 - Shared Commercial Operations in the 3550-3650 MHz Band GPO FDSys XML | Text",
