    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{86834=The invention further provides methods of making low-emissivity stacks having a low SHGC as described, the methods including depositing on a substrate the coatings described herein. The layers in the multilayer coatings of the present invention can be deposited by conventional physical and chemical vapor deposition techniques. The details of these techniques are well known in the art and will not be repeated here. Suitable deposition techniques include sputtering methods. Suitable sputtering methods include DC sputtering, using metallic targets, and AC and RF sputtering, using metallic and non-metallic targets. All can utilize magnetron sputtering. The sputtering can be in an inert gas, or can be carried out reactively in reactive gas. The total gas pressure can be maintained in a range from 5\ufffd10 \u22124 to 8\ufffd10\u22122 mbar, preferably from 1\ufffd10\u22123 to 1\ufffd10\u22122 mbar. Sputtering voltages can be in a range from 200 to 1200 V, preferably 250 to 1000 V. Dynamic deposition rates can be in a range of from 25 to 4000 nm-mm2/W-sec, preferably 30 to 700 nm-mm2/W-sec. Coaters manufactured by Leybold Systems GmbH with model numbers Typ A 2540 Z 5 H/13-22 and Typ A 2540 Z 5 H/20-29 are suitable for sputter depositing the multilayer coatings of the present invention., 100458=The terms \u201cheat treatment\u201d, \u201cheat treated\u201d and \u201cheat treating\u201d as used herein mean heating the article to a temperature sufficient to enable thermal tempering, bending, or heat strengthening of the glass inclusive article. This definition includes, for example, heating a coated article to a temperature of at least about 1100 degrees F. (e.g., to a temperature of from about 550 degrees C. to 700 degrees C.) for a sufficient period to enable tempering, heat strengthening, or bending., 93981=\u201cEmissivity\u201d (or emittance) (\u201cE\u201d or \u201ce\u201d) is a measure, or characteristic of both absorption and reflectance of light at given wavelengths. It is usually represented by the formula: E=1\u2212Reflectancefilm. For architectural purposes, emissivity values become quite important in the so-called \u201cmid-range\u201d, sometimes also called the \u201cfar range\u201d of the infrared spectrum, i.e. about 2,500-40,000 nm., for example, as specified by the WINDOW 4.1 program, LBL-35298 (1994) by Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories, as referenced below. The term \u201cemissivity\u201d as used herein, is thus used to refer to emissivity values measured in this infrared range as specified by ASTM Standard E 1585-93 entitled \u201cStandard Test Method for Measuring and Calculating Emittance of Architectural Flat Glass Products Using Radiometric Measurements\u201d. This Standard, and its provisions, are incorporated herein by reference. In this Standard, emissivity is reported as hemispherical emissivity (Eh) and normal emissivity (En)., 92331=Other similar coordinates may be equivalently used such as by the subscript \u201ch\u201d to signify the conventional use of the Hunter method (or units) I11. C, 100 observer, or the CIE LUV u*v* coordinates. These scales are defined herein according to ASTM D-2244-93 \u201cStandard Test Method for Calculation of Color Differences From Instrumentally Measured Color Coordinates\u201d Sep. 15, 1993 as augmented by ASTM E-308-95, Annual Book of ASTM Standards, Vol. 06.01 \u201cStandard Method for Computing the Colors of Objects by 10 Using the CIE System\u201d and/or as reported in IES LIGHTING HANDBOOK 1981 Reference Volume., 180928=The present Example includes a coating having the following structure, which employs a 2:1 oxygen:kw ratio in the NiCr layer., 67387=The barrier layer (whether separate or an absorbing barrier layer) protects the Ag layer against attack of the plasma when sputtering the dielectric on top of it. It also improves the chemical durability by controlling the diffusion of aggressive species like O2, O, H2O, and Na+. In a preferred embodiment, the barrier is transparent. The barrier can comprise, without limitation, NiCr, NiCrOx, TiOx, NiCrNxOy, NiCrNx, Ti or other metal or metals, or subnitrides or suboxides thereof. A preferred barrier is NiCrOx. In such layers, particularly in the first (i.e., bottom) NiCrOx layer, it may comprise approximately 15 to 60 atomic percent oxygen. Preferably, the atomic percent oxygen is from 20% to 55%. Thermal durability for the temperable versions of this invention was improved when the first NiCrOx layer contained about 20 atomic percent oxygen. In preferred embodiments, (particularly when the barrier is modified to also have increased absorbing qualities), the barrier comprises NiCrOx and is a thin protective layer sputtered on silver and deposited from planar targets. It is preferably sputtered in an argon-oxygen mixture. The power to oxygen flow (sccm) is the preferred method used to estimate oxidation in sputtered NiCrOx. The ratio used for fully oxidized NiCrOx is 10:1. The ratio used in some coatings in accordance with the inventions preferably varies from 7.5:1 to 8.0:1., 95035=The actual accumulation of data for measurement of such emissivity values is conventional and may be done by using, for example, a Beckman Model 4260 spectrophotometer with \u201cVW\u201d attachment (Beckman Scientific Inst. Corp.). This spectrophotometer measures reflectance versus wavelength, and from this, emissivity is calculated using the aforesaid ASTM Standard 1585-93., 95900=\u201cHaze\u201d is defined as follows. Light diffused in many directions causes a loss in contrast. The term \u201chaze\u201d is defined herein in accordance with ASTM D 1003 which defines haze as that percentage of light which in passing through deviates from the incident beam greater than 2.5 degrees on the average. \u201cHaze\u201d may be measured herein by a Byk Gardner haze meter (all haze values herein are measured by such a haze meter and are given as a percentage of light scattered). Another term employed herein is \u201csheet resistance\u201d. Sheet resistance (Rs) is a well known term in the art and is used herein in accordance with its well known meaning. It is here reported in ohms per square units. Generally speaking, this term refers to the resistance in ohms for any square of a layer system on a glass substrate to an electric current passed through the layer system. Sheet resistance is an indication of how well the layer or layer system is reflecting infrared energy, and is thus often used along with emissivity as a measure of this characteristic. \u201cSheet resistance\u201d may for example be conveniently measured by using a 4-point probe ohmmeter, such as a dispensable 4-point resistivity probe with a Magnetron Instruments Corp. head, Model M-800 produced by Signatone Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif., 91927=Color characteristics are measured and reported herein using the CIE LAB 1976 a*, b* coordinates and scale (i.e. the CIE 1976 a*b* diagram, D65 10 degree observer), wherein:, 95436=The term Rsolar refers to total solar energy reflectance (glass side herein), and is a weighted average of IR reflectance, visible reflectance, and UV reflectance. This term may be calculated in accordance with the known DIN 410 and ISO 13837 (December 1998) Table 1, p. 22 for automotive applications, and the known ASHRAE 142 standard for architectural applications, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.}",
