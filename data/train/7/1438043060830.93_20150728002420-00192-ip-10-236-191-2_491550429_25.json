Preferably, the amount of the residue in the cellulose product is about 50 to 10,000 ppm, more preferably about 250 to 3000, and most preferably about 500 to 2000 ppm, based on SiO2., 114198=Agitation applied during formation of the metal silicate complexes also affects the ability of the metal silicate complexes to remain in solution. If no agitation is applied, under some circumstances, the water-soluble complex of the present invention may locally precipitate due to overconcentration. The effect of agitation, however, is difficult to quantify. The amount of agitation depends upon such factors as the amount and viscosity of the solution, size of the container, size and type of stirrer bar or propeller, rotation speed of stirrer or mixer, and so on. For example, in laboratory preparation, when a 100 ml of a metal silicate complex solution in a 200 ml beaker is mixed using a 1\u2033 stirrer bar on a MIRAK\u2122 Magnetic Stirrer (Model #L SO&3235-60, Bernstead Thermolyne Corporation, 2555 Kerper Blvd., Dubuque, Iowa 52004), 300 rpm or higher mixing speed should be proper. In general, as long as possible, agitation should be maximized. However, if agitation is too high, it may not be economical due to overconsumption of energy, or it may cause vibration of the equipment or split of the solution., 266800=In Test No. 13, 10 #/T of cationic starch, 5 #/T of alum, and 1 #/T of CPAM (Novus 8910) were added to 1000 ml of a paper furnish having a 0.3 wt % consistency and containing 65% weight fibers and 35 wt % precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) filler by weight of the total dry finish., 265739=In Test No. 10, 10 #/T of cationic starch, 5 #/T of alum, and 1 #/T of CPAM (Novus 8910) were added to 1000 ml of a paper furnish having a 0.3 wt % consistency and containing 80% weight fibers and 20 wt % precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) filler by weight of the total dry finish. 2 #/T of Ca/Mg silicate complex was subsequently added to the paper furnish., 83534=JP 1072793 to Haimo discloses a method for making paper by directly adding an aqueous solution of sodium orthosilicate to the paper slurry. The orthosilicate solution of Haimo is prepared in a separate step (e.g., treatment of aluminum sulfate to adjust the pH) prior to being added to the paper slurry., 139286=The pH of the paper furnish was from 8.0 to 8.9. The temperature of the paper furnish was from 21\ufffd C. to 25\ufffd C. The fibers used in the paper furnish was a 70/30 blend of hardwood/softwood. The CSF drainage test was performed by mixing 1000 ml of the paper furnish in a squared beaker at ambient temperature (unless specified) and at 1200 rpm mixing speed. The paper furnish contains silicate complex or control samples and optional additives., 264074=In Test No. 5, 10 #/T of cationic starch, 5 #/T of alum, and 1 #/T of CPAM (Novus 8910) were added to 1000 ml of a paper furnish having a 0.3 wt % consistency and containing 90% weight fibers and 10 wt % precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) filler by weight of the total dry finish., 263696=In Test No. 4, 10 #/T of cationic starch, 5 #/T of alum, and 0.25 #/T of APAM (PA8130) were added to 1000 ml of a paper furnish having a 0.3 wt % consistency and containing 100% weight fibers and 0 wt % precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) filler by weight of the total dry finish. 2 #/T of Ca/Mg silicate complex was subsequently added to the paper furnish., 262714=In Test No. 1, 10 #/T of cationic starch, 5 #/T of alum, and 1 #/T of CPAM (Novus 8910) were added to 1000 ml of a paper furnish having a 0.3 wt % consistency and containing 100% weight fibers and 0 wt % precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) filler by weight of the total dry finish., 266421=In Test No. 12, 10 #/T of cationic starch, 5 #/T of alum, and 0.25 #/T of APAM (PA8130) were added to 1000 ml of a paper furnish having a 0.3 wt % consistency and containing 80% weight fibers and 20 wt % precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) filler by weight of the total dry finish. 2 #/T of Ca/Mg silicate complex was subsequently added to the paper furnish., 267482=In Test No. 15, 10 #/T of cationic starch, 5 #/T of alum, and 0.25 #/T of APAM (PA8130) were added to 1000 ml of a paper furnish having a 0.3 wt % consistency and containing 65% weight fibers and 35 wt % precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) filler by weight of the total dry finish., 263016=In Test No. 2, 10 #/T of cationic starch, 5 #/T of alum, and 1 #/T of CPAM (Novus 8910) were added to 1000 ml of a paper furnish having a 0.3 wt % consistency and containing 100% weight fibers and 0 wt % precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) filler by weight of the total dry finish. 2 #/T of Ca/Mg silicate complex was subsequently added to the paper furnish.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The preceding examples can be repeated with similar success by substituting the generically and specifically described constituents and/or operating conditions of this invention for those used in the preceding examples. From the foregoing descriptions, one skilled in the art can easily ascertain the essential characteristics of this invention, and without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, can make various changes and modifications of the invention to adapt to various usages and conditions. The above examples also illustrate that the addition of at least one of the additives selected from a cationic starch, a coagulant, and a flocculent, followed by the addition of a water soluble metal complex or sodium silicate to the paper furnish, improves drainage and retention properties and is cost effective in manufacturing paper and paperboard. The above examples also illustrate that by adding sodium silicate to the paper furnish, drainage and retention properties of the paper furnish were also improved. The above examples illustrate that by using an aqueous solution containing metal ions, such as Mg2+ and/or Ca2+ ions to dilute the sodium silicate so that the sodium silicate was converted to active magnesium and/or calcium silicates, drainage and retention properties of the paper furnish were significantly improved. As shown in Table 18, when the turbidity of the metal silicate complexes increases from about 30 NTU to 71 NTU, drainage performance drastically drops.",
