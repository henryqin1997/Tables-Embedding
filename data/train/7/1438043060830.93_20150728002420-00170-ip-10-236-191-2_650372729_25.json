    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{26612=This page is an introduction to our pages on SATS (Standard Attainment Tests) and SATS\u00a0revision. Officially called 'National Curriculum teacher assessments and key stage tests', we have used the terminology familiar to most schools and to parents. Many more pages are available to\u00a0subscribers to Parents in Touch. Below are illustrated just some examples of the many SATS papers available to our members.\u00a0 We also show a selection from our SATS\u00a0revision papers to help improve your child's results. SATS\u00a0papers from 2003 onwards, including papers for more able and less able, all the KS1 papers which are allowed to be published and more revision papers\u00a0are available through our Worksheet Finder. More information., 116792=There will not be a Key Stage 2 science sampling test in 2013; a new, biennial (every other year), pupil-level sampling system will be introduced in 2014.\u00a0, 36311=The test frameworks are currently draft documents. National curriculum tests take up to 3 years to develop. The process includes 2 rounds of expert review of each potential question as well as 2 trials with children. We may make small changes as a result of this work; however, we do not expect the main elements of the frameworks to change. The test frameworks do not provide information on how you should teach the new national curriculum. You should not use the frameworks to guide teaching and learning. Sample materials We have published a small number of sample questions for each key stage and subject. These documents illustrate new question types that will be included in tests from 2016. They also indicate how some of the new curriculum content will be assessed. How the tests will be administered Key stage 1 Administration arrangements are currently being confirmed. We will provide information online and via emails to headteachers once decisions have been made. Administration and marking guidance will be provided with the live tests. Key stage 2 The key stage 2 tests will be administered and marked in the same way as the current tests. Further information During the 2015 summer term we will publish:, 116591=Results from the level 6 tests will continue to be used in the accountability framework for 2012/13. Further information will be published on this website in the spring term., 35125=The new national curriculum will be assessed for the first time in May 2016. There will be new tests for key stage 1, as well as key stage 2. What the tests will cover: The tests will cover English reading, English grammar, punctuation and spelling, and mathematics at key stages 1 and 2. There will also be a key stage 2 science sampling test every other year. Test frameworks Test frameworks https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-curriculum-assessments-test-frameworks are available for each test. The frameworks are written primarily for test developers, however teachers may also be interested in them. Each test framework sets out:, 117062=The 2015 Key Stage 2 tests will take place from 11-14 May. Schools have been asked to keep this period free for administering the Key Stage 2 tests., 46184=A new statutory test of English grammar, punctuation and spelling will be introduced for children at the end of Key Stage 2 from May 2013. This implements an important recommendation of Lord Bew\u2019s independent review that writing composition should be subject to teacher assessment only, with the more 'technical' aspects of English - such as punctuation and spelling - assessed via an externally marked test.}",
