Normal tow with cvt is 1000lbs and manual trans with tow package 2000lbs. Looking at the jeep sight. Haven't seen the tow capabilities for the patriot or diesel compass yet.

The XJ has been gone for 5 or 6 years now. It's not coming back. It's not being reincarnated. DCX screwed up royally by axing the XJ when they did and they know it. That's why they keep bringing the car back up. You don't see Ford calling every new vehicle they make a Galaxie reincarnate. Dropping the XJ led everyone to compare the KJ to the XJ",
