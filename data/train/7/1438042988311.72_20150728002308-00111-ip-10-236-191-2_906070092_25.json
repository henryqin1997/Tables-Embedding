With only 2,100 students and plenty of teachers, all of my classes have a 20:1 or less student-teacher ratio. All of my teachers were easy to find and talk to. As a mathematics major, I also found that there were multiple opportunities to meet and talk to the math faculty thru clubs and Tea Time. The campus is beautiful, and easy to memorize.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students The students that like to get involved on campus and those who want to learn. Tips for prospective students Apply for the scholarships even if you do not think you fit into the requirements. Take the campus tours! They are great! The scenery is beautiful! Take the roommate questionnaire and don't judge your roommate before you spend at least a week with them. Bang for the buck It is a little expensive but they offer a lot of scholarships. The 19 meal a week meal-plan is not ideal but they are revising it. Am enjoying being here There are many on-campus activities such as BINGO, The President's Ball (kinda like a Homecoming), Casino Night, Karaoke, and so much more and everyone knows each other. The students, teachers, and workers are very nice. Am learning a lot The teachers on campus try and reach every student. You have to want to learn! The teachers aren't going to bother with someone who doesn't want to learn. Login to rate or flag the reviews",
