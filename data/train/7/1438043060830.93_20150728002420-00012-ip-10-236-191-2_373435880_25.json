The differences in TSI between the maxima and minima are very small however, on the order of 0.1%. Two of the datasets (PMOD and ACRIM) suggest that the most recent solar minimum in 2008 (the start of solar cycle 24) was somewhat lower than the TSI during the two preceding minima. In Box 10.2 of AR5 the IPCC concludes that \u201cit is very likely that there has been a small decrease in solar forcing of \u20130.04 [\u20130.08 to 0.00] W/m2 over a period with direct satellite measurements of solar output from 1986 to 2008\u201d and therefore that \u201cthere is high confidence that changes in total solar irradiance have not contributed to global warming during that period\u201d., 50098=Referring back to general point 6, the change in TSI between 1750 and 1980 of dS = 0.38 Wm-2 is a radiative forcing of FRS \u2248 0.06 Wm-2. Hence the recent downturn in solar activity is giving us direct evidence that the contribution of TSI is small, of order a few percent of the effect of well mixed greenhouse gases. This agrees with modelling studies that have predicted that even a return to Maunder minimum TSI values would only give a minor slowing of greenhouse gas driven warming [Feulner and Rahmstorf , 2010; Jones et al., 2012]. The inferred radiative forcing of FRS \u2248 0.06 Wm-2 is very similar to the IPCC estimate and the main change to the IPCC consensus values that I would suggest is needed is that the level of confidence in the value should, in the light of the recent data, be changed from \u201cmedium\u201d to \u201chigh\u201d., 475127=Figure 5 Updated Fig. 2 in Koutsoyiannis and Montanari [21] testing lagged climatic differences based on the HadCrut4 data set (1850-2012; see explanation in text)., 476338=Our (pseudo)test relies on climatic differences for different time lags (not just that of the latest and earliest values). For example, assuming a lag of 30 years (equal to the period for which we defined a climatic value), the climate difference between 2012 and 1982 is 0.31\u00b0C \u2013 (\u20130.05\u00b0C) = 0.36\u00b0C, where the value - 0.05\u00b0C is the average of years 1953-82. The value 0.36\u00b0C is plotted as a green triangle in Figure 5 at year 2012. Likewise, we find climatic differences for years 2011, 2010, \u2026, 1909, all for lag 30. Plotting all these we get the series of green triangles shown in Figure 5. We repeat the same procedure for time lags that are multiples of 30 years, namely 60 years (red points), 90 years (blue points) and 120 years (purple points)., 144670=My personal opinion is that we don\u2019t have a clear definition of Grand Episodes (Maxima and Minima), including the Maunder Minimum. Note in Figure 5 a new definition of the limits dates of the Maunder Minimum(Vaquero and Trigo, 2015) that illustrate the problem with the exact definitions of Grand Episodes. The common limits dates for the MM are 1645-1715, proposed by Eddy (1976). However, we have proposed a redefinition of the Maunder Minimum period with the core \u201cDeep Maunder Minimum\u201d spanning from 1645 to 1700 (that corresponds to the Grand Minimum state) and a wider \u201cExtended Maunder Minimum\u201d for the longer period 1618\u20131723 that includes the transition periods. The origin of this new \u201cdefinition\u201d was the discovery of sunspot observations made by G. Marcgraf in 1637. A new analysis of this data (and other revised historical observations) indicated a possibly gradual onset of the minimum with reduced activity starting two cycles earlier (Vaquero et al., 2011)., 117565=Richards, M.

The timing and spatial structure of the MCA and LIA are complex (see Box 6.4 in AR4 and Diaz et al., 2011; and Section 5.5), with different reconstructions exhibiting warm and cold conditions at different times for different regions and seasons. The median of the NH temperature reconstructions (Figure 5.7) indicates mostly warm conditions from about 950 to about 1250 and colder conditions from about 1450 to about 1850; these time intervals are chosen here to represent the MCA and the LIA, respectively., 96148=Shapiro et al.

Astron. & Astrophys. 529, A67. doi: 10.1051/0004-6361/201016173, 475345=The method has the advantages that it uses the entire series (not a few values), it considers the actual climatic values (not their ranks) and it avoids specifying a mathematical form of trend (e.g. linear). Furthermore, it is simple: First we calculate the climatic value of each year as the average of the present and the previous 29 years. This is plotted as a pink continuous line in Figure 5, where we can see, among other things, that the latest climatic value is 0.31\u00b0C (at 2012, being the average of HadCrut4 data values for 1983-2012), while the earliest one was \u20130.30\u00b0C (at 1879, being the average of 1850-79). Thus, during the last 134 years the climate has warmed by 0.61\u00b0C. Note that no subjective smoothing is made here (in contrast to the graphs by CRU), and thus the climatic series has length 134 years (but with only 5 non-overlapping values), while the annual series has length 163., 395476=\u00b7 Mauritsen, T., et al.

Source: Santer (2008), 139216=Maunder Minimum The classical reconstruction of solar activity based on the Wolf number started in 1700, 1749 and 1818 at annual, monthly and daily scales respectively (International Sunspot Number, ISN, see Clette, 2011). Therefore, it does not cover the Maunder Minimum. However a reconstruction by Hoyt and Schatten (the so-called Group Sunspot Number, GSN) published in 1998 starts in 1610 and, therefore, is an extremely useful tool to investigate the Maunder Minimum. The Group Sunspot Number is based only on the number of sunspot groups that are observed in the solar disc. However the International Sunspot Number is computed from the number of sunspot groups and the number of individual spots that are observed in the solar disc. GSN and ISN are pretty similar from approximately 1880 onwards. However they are very different in the 18th century and much of the 19th century. GSN values show a strong upward trend since the end of the Maunder Minimum up to now while values of ISN show no significant trend., 64108=Gray L.J., J. Beer, M. Geller, J. Haigh, M. Lockwood, K.

(This describes the IUK dataset), 282119=In Fig. 2, I have reproduced panel D of Fig. 4 from Santer et al. (2005), except with updated measured data, the addition of the reanalysis data, and the use of CMIP-5 model results. The CMIP-5 model results for 1979-2012 were made by splicing together results from 20th century simulations (before 2005, using measured values of the forcings), and RCP8.5 21st century predictions (after 2005, results using predicted values for the various forcings. For details on this process, see Santer et al., 2012), 341333=[7] Kundzewicz, Zbigniew W. and Stakhiv, Eugene Z.(2010) 'Are climate models \u201cready for prime time\u201d inwater resources management applications, or is more research needed?', Hydrological Sciences Journal, 55: 7, 1085 \u20141089, 316159=We see that all 73 models anticipated greater warming than actually occurred for the period 1979-2012. Of importance here too is that the balloons and satellites represent two independent observing systems but they display extremely consistent results. This provides a relatively high level of confidence that the observations as depicted here have small errors. The observational trends from both systems are slightly less than +0.06 \u00b0C/decade which is a value insignificantly different from zero. The mean TMT model trend is +0.26 \u00b0C/decade which is significantly positive in a statistical sense. The observed satellite and balloon TLT trends (not shown) are +0.10 and +0.09 \u00b0C/decade respectively, and the mean model TLT trend is +0.28 \u00b0C/decade. In a strict hypothesis test, the mean model trend can be shown to be statistically different from that of the observations, so that one can say the model-mean has been falsified (a result stated in a number of publications already for earlier sets of model output.) In other words, the model mean tropical tropospheric temperature trend is warming significantly faster than observations (See Douglass and Christy 2013 for further information.), 430675=More recently, another paper [2] followed somewhat similar ideas, although for the Arctic temperature rather than the global mean. A discussion ensued after my posting of \u2018What is signal and what is noise?\u2019 on RealClimate.org. A meeting is planned in Troms\u00f8, Norway in the beginning of May to discuss our differences - much in the spirit of Climate Dialogue., 177691=Some recent papers which explore the CMIP ensembles have presented arguments that the climate models with the higher sensitivities tend to be more realistic when we examine them in various ways (e.g. Fasullo and Trenberth 2012, Shindell 2014). If these results are correct, then the current moderate warming rate is a bit of an aberration, and so a substantial acceleration in the warming rate can be expected to occur in the near future, sufficient not only to match the modelled warming rate, but even to catch up the recent lost ground. It must be noted that these analyses are primarily qualitative in nature, in that they do not provide quantitative probabilistic estimates of the sensitivity (instead merely arguing that higher values are preferred). Thus it is difficult to judge whether they really do contradict analyses based on the recent warming., 294187=Confidence and Implications for Atmospheric Physics I first became interested in the tropical lapse rate (now alternatively known as \u201chot spot\u201d) issue around 2001, shortly after it was raised in a prominent paper in Science (Gaffen et al. 2000). I had been using radiosonde data to look at wind fields and temperature trends near the tropical tropopause and lower stratosphere. This new problem drew my attention because I was interested in how tropical atmospheric convection (e.g. storms) responds to its environment, one of the grand unsolved problems in atmospheric modelling. Tropical convection was supposed to prevent the kind of lapse-rate changes that were being reported, so what was going on?, 197689=The general lack of strong decadal shifts in total OHC have recently been corroborated by estimates of global thermometric sea level rise from satellite altimetry, which show remarkable persistence in the rate of thermometric expansion since 1993 (15). Further, efforts to deduce variability in the planetary imbalance from the satellite record of top of atmosphere radiative fluxes also find little change between the 1990s and 2000s (Richard Allan, personal communication)., 389846=\u00b7 Driscoll, S., A.

(This discussed HadCRUT4 and the HadCRUT4 error ensembles), 56852=Solar Influences on Regional/Seasonal Climates This is an area of some academic debate, but there is a growing body of evidence that there are effects of solar changes on some regional and seasonal climates [see reviews by Gray et al., 2010, Lockwood et al., 2012]. The mechanisms largely involve modulation of the jet stream (particularly in the northern hemisphere which is different from that in the south because it passes over much more complex ground orography than the southern jet stream which is largely over ocean)., 106120=My preferred temperature reconstruction for the last 2000 years is Ljungqvist (2010) for the extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere as shown in Figure 6. This reconstruction utilizes many paleo-temperature proxies never before included in any large-scale temperature reconstruction. It shows clearly the Roman and Medieval warm periods. The difference between the warmest decade (950-959) and the coldest (1690-1699) is 0.9 \u00b0C in this reconstruction. The author admits there is a divergence problem also in his reconstruction, i.e. that the tree-ring growth shows lower temperature in the last decades of the 20th century than the thermometer measurements suggest. The author also concludes that the cooling during the Little Ice Age (LIA) probably is larger than his estimates, since the trees reflect summer temperatures, while other seasons may have cooled more., 358275=Pielke, R.

For example, the coldest winter in the CET record is 1683-4, right in the middle of the Maunder minimum; but the winter just two years later was the fifth hottest in the whole 350-year CET record.

He has published over 50 peer-reviewed papers dealing with aspects of this work, aimed primarily at understanding variability in clouds, the tropical monsoons, and the global water and energy cycles. His work has centered on identifying strengths and weakness across observations and models, and has emphasized the benefits of holistic evaluation of the climate system with multiple datasets, theoretical constraints, and novel techniques. Dr. Fasullo is a member of various committees and science teams, and participated in the IPCC AR4 report that contributed to the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to IPCC in 2007., 278597=Now, I will turn my attention to one of the core questions of this discussion \u2013 \u201ccan we detect/have detected a hot spot in the observations \u201c. On monthly time scales, there is no question. If we average across the tropics, the temperature of the upper troposphere is strongly correlated with the temperature of the surface, only with larger amplitude (Santer et al., 2005). On decadal time scales, the results obtained depend on the datasets chosen, as Santer 2005 showed for the RSS and UAH satellite datasets and a few homogenized radiosonde datasets. Here we expand this a little further to include more homogenized radiosonde datasets and two of the more recent reanalysis datasets, MERRA and ERA-Interim. Figure 1 shows the ratio of the mid to upper tropospheric temperature trends to surface temperature trends in the deep tropics (20S to 20N). Each point on the graph is the trend starting in January 1979, and ending at the date on the x-axis. The surface temperature is from HADCRUT4. The mid to upper tropospheric data is the \u201ctemperature tropical troposphere\u201d product, or TTT, first introduced by Fu and Johanson (2005). For MSU/AMSU, it is equal to 1.1*TMT \u2013 0.1*TLS. This combination has the effect of adjusting for the cooling effect of the stratosphere on TMT by subtracting off part of the stratospheric cooling measured by TLS. The weighting function for this product is centered in the mid to upper tropical troposphere, where we expect the hot spot to be most pronounced., 49438=Looking at 1750, the difference is not quite so great: the Shapiro et al. reconstruction gives around 1364. 5 Wm-2 which is 1.3 Wm-2 lower than we would estimate from the recent TSI data. Hence the Shapiro et al. reconstruction appears to overestimate both the long term trend in TSI after 1900 and the fluctuation level before 1900. The value of TSI for 1750 and 1900 of 1365.77 Wm-2 inferred here does agree very well with many other recent reconstructions of TSI [for example, Wang et al., 2005; Foukal et al., 2006; Krivova et al., 2011; Schrijver et al., 2011]., 244738=Knutti, R., T.F.

Through the years each group has updated their products as new information has come to light, and we use the latest versions as of June 2013., 104974=As shown in Figure 5, lower panel, the 10-yr average sunspot no has never been as high the last 1000 yrs as in the last part of the 20th century. In the same graph I have shown a first harmonic component, with period 190 years, of the timing of sunspot minima. This period apparently controls the timing of sunspot minima. When this curve is near minima or is ascending, sunspot periods become longer, and arrive delayed. This was for the first time demonstrated by Richards et al. (2009)., 247136=Ring, M.J., D.

He concludes that the reduction in solar activity disguises a global temperature rise that otherwise would have happened., 77348=(1) The analytical models such as the CMIP5 GCMs adopted by the IPCC (2013) have used a solar forcing function deduced only from a specific total solar irradiance proxy record that shows only a very small secular variability (e.g. Wang et al. (2005)), while alternative total solar irradiance proxy models showing a far greater secular variability and different details in the patters also exist (Hoyt and Schatten, 1997; Shapiro et al., 2011). These alternative solar models better correlate with the temperature patterns on multiple scales and reconstruct a large fraction of the warming observed since 1850 (Scafetta, 2013b; Hoyt and Schatten, 1997; Soon, 2009; Soon, 2005; Soon and Legates, 2013)., 412860=Castro, C.L., R.A.

However, they tend to reflect planetary temperature changes with a decadal-scale delay. The GISP2 record ends in 1855 before the onset of the 20th Century warming. A simple harmonic model based on wavelet analysis, which we may call a natural cycle model, with only 3 long periods (2800, 1190 and 560 yr) is used to forecast the observed warming until 2800 (Humlum et al., 2011). This indicates that the modern maximum will peak at some time this century. A more detailed harmonic analysis and a comparison with the HadCRUT4 temperature data set shows that we are close to the peak of this long period cycle, which will have a maximum around 2060 (Solheim, 2013a)., 8905=Figure 1: Radiative forcing estimates in 2011 relative to 1750 and aggregated uncertainties for the main drivers of climate change.

Sunspots - darks spots on the sun caused by intense magnetic activity - are counted since 1610 (see figure 3 below). Although the dark sunspots are cooler areas at the surface of the sun, the surrounding margins of sunspots are brighter than the average. Overall, more sunspots increase the Sun's solar brightness. Sunspots were rarely observed during the Maunder Minimum in the second part of the 17th century (approximately from 1645 to 1715) for reasons which are not yet fully understood., 99201=According to the latest IPCC report, AR5, the influence of the Sun on our climate since pre-industrial times, in terms of radiative forcing, is very small compared to the effect of greenhouse gases.

As early as 2011, colleagues and I demonstrated that the NCAR CCSM4 reproduced periods analogous to the current hiatus, with hiatus periods accompanying changes in the vertical redistribution of heat driven by winds at low latitudes (17). Subsequent work has shown that similar behavior is evident across a wide range of GCMs. Recent observations have only reinforced the likelihood that the current hiatus is consistent with such simulated periods. The main question that persists relates mainly to the broader context for the hiatus, given the uncertainties surrounding internal variability, and just how unusual such an event may be., 119390=Stauning, P.

If the present warming was a result of natural fluctuations, it would imply a high climate sensitivity, and similar variations in the past. Moreover, it would suggest that any known forcing, such as GHGs, would be amplified accordingly. The climate sensitivity may be a common denominator for natural fluctuations and forced trends (Figure 3)., 184928=Shindell, D. T. (2014). Inhomogeneous forcing and transient climate sensitivity. Nature Climate Change, 4(4), 274\u2013277. doi:10.1038/nclimate2136, 82962=Figure 2B shows that the radiosonde temperature anomalies, after an appropriate filtering of other climatic factors, reveals a clear signature of the 11-year solar cycle reconstructed by the cosmic ray record (Svensmark and Friis-Christensen, 2007).

Tests of radiosonde homogenisation methods (e.g., Thorne et al. 2011) show that they are often unreliable. MSU is not well calibrated and its homogenisation issues are also serious, as shown by the range of results previously obtained from this instrument series. To obtain upper-tropospheric trends from Channel 2 of MSU requires subtracting out a large contribution to trends in this channel coming from lower-stratospheric cooling. The latter remains highly uncertain due to a discrepancy between cooling rates in radiosondes and MSU. Tropical ozone trends are sufficiently uncertain so as to render either of these physically plausible (Solomon et al. 2012). I used to think (as do most others) that the radiosondes were wrong, but in Sherwood et al. 2008 we found (to my surprise) that when we homogenised the global radiosonde data they began to show cooling in the lower stratosphere that was very similar to that of MSU Channel 4 at each latitude, except for a large offset that varied smoothly with latitude. Such a smoothly varying and relatively uniform offset is very different from what we\u2019d expect from radiosonde trend biases (which tend to vary at lot from one station to the next) but is consistent with an uncorrected calibration error in MSU Channel 4. If that were indeed responsible, it would imply that there has been more cooling in the stratosphere than anyone has reckoned on, and that the true upper-tropospheric warming is therefore stronger than what any group now infers from MSU data. By the way, our tropospheric data also came out very close to those published at the time by RSS, both in global mean and in the latitudinal variation (Sherwood et al., 2008)., 396879=\u00b7 Van Oldenborgh, G.J., F.J.

Clim.Dyn. doi:10.1007/s00382-012-1313-4 who report quite limited predictive skill in two regions of the oceans on the decadal time period, but no regional skill elsewhere, when they conclude that \"A 4-model 12-member ensemble of 10-yr hindcasts has been analysed for skill in SST, 2m temperature and precipitation. The main source of skill in temperature is the trend, which is primarily forced by greenhouse gases and aerosols. This trend contributes almost everywhere to the skill. Variation in the global mean temperature around the trend do not have any skill beyond the first year. However, regionally there appears to be skill beyond the trend in the two areas of well-known low-frequency variability: SST in parts of the North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans is predicted better than persistence. A comparison with the CMIP3 ensemble shows that the skill in the northern North Atlantic and eastern Pacific is most likely due to the initialisation, whereas the skill in the subtropical North Atlantic and western North Pacific are probably due to the forcing.\", 79826=For example, one of the reasons why the IPCC claims that the sun has not contributed to the warming observed since 1970s is because the adopted solar model (Wang et al., 2005) suggests that the average solar activity was quite constant or even decreased during this period. This interpretation follows the PMOD total solar irradiance satellite composite by Fr\u00f6hlich (2006). However, Scafetta and Willson (2009); Scafetta and Willson (2014) have shown that PMOD used altered total solar irradiance satellite records based on hypotheses that appear contradictory. On the contrary, the unaltered total solar irradiance satellite records are combined in the ACRIM composite which suggests that solar activity increased from 1980 to 2000 and decreased afterward (Willson and Mordvinov, 2003). Even if the direct effect of the total solar irradiance may be small and the difference between ACRIM and the PMOD might be climatically negligible, the pattern shown by the ACRIM composite suggests a dynamics, for example a 60-year oscillation, regulated by astronomical forcings whose harmonics are found in the climate system as well (Scafetta, 2010; Scafetta, 2013b; Scafetta, 2012a; Scafetta,2014).

The output of such model simulations is then used by the climate impacts community to investigate what potential future benefits or threats could be expected.

Climate models, climate change in the distant past (palaeo records) and climatological constraints generally result in (much) higher estimates for ECS., 332703=[Update 15 April 2015] Summaries online The summaries of the Climate Dialogue on Regional Modelling are now online (see links below).

For example, no climate model run for the IPCC AR4 (c. 2006) was able to reproduce the losses of Arctic sea ice that had been observed in recent decades (and which have continued accelerating since). No model, to my knowledge, produces the large asymmetry in warming between the north and south poles observed since 1980. Models underpredict the observed poleward shifts of the atmospheric circulation and climate zones by about a factor of three over this same period (Allen et al. 2012); cannot explain the warmings at high latitudes indicated by paleaoclimate data in past warm climates such as the Pliocene (Fedorov et al. 2013); appear to underpredict observed trends in the hydrological cycle (Wentz et al. 2007, Min et al. 2011) and in their simulated climatologies tend to produce rain that is too frequent, too light, and on land falls at the wrong time of day (Stephens et al. 2010). Finally, the tropical oceans are not warming as much as the land areas, or as much as predicted by most models, and this may be the root cause of why the recent warming of the tropical atmosphere is slower than predicted by most models (there is a nice series of posts about this on Isaac Held\u2019s blog). What makes the \u201chot spot\u201d more important than these other discrepancies which, in many cases, are supported by more convincing evidence? Is it because the \u201cmissing hot spot\u201d can be spun into a tale of model exaggeration, whereas all the other problems suggest the opposite problem?, 184427=Rohling, E. J., Rohling, E.

Therefore, the estimations of GSN from Hevelius\u2019 direct observations are 3-8 times higher than the values obtained by Hoyt and Schatten. Obviously, the values remain very low if we compare them with modern values (see Figure 3).

If the models cannot even accurately simulate current climate statistics when they are not constrained by real world data, the expense to run them to produce detailed spatial maps is not worthwhile.

It is also the period for which the greatest amount of accumulation of heat energy (joules) should be evident due to the increasing impact of the rising greenhouse gas concentrations., 60964=The \u201cLittle Ice Age\u201d I dislike this name as it has been used to build arguments that rely on the name which, as mentioned in point 7, is inherently bad science. Many paleoclimate records show an interval of lower temperatures but the start and end dates are not well agreed. For example it has been claimed to correspond to the Maunder minimum (i.e. 1645-1715) , such that in many arguments the terms \u201cMaunder minimum\u201d and \u201cLittle Ice Age\u201d are even taken to be synonymous! This is undoubtedly invalid as most paleoclimate records indicate that the lower temperatures began at least 50 years before the start of the Maunder minimum., 65301=Krivova, N. A., S. K.

However, direct measurements of the sun by satellite started only in 1978. There is still considerable debate about the exact absolute values of the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) in this period. The difficulty is that one has to merge data from different satellites together. The most recent SORCE/TIM measurements are probably our best shot and the background level of TSI therefore seems to be around 1361 W/m2 ., 248339=Tomassini, L., P. Reichert, R. Knutti, T.F.

Clim., doi:10.1175/JCLI-D-12\u201300476.1., 110913=If we want to compare insolation today with 1750, we have also to consider the effect of perihelion change.We are in the (lucky) situation that the Earth at present is in the perihelion position around Jan 4th. The difference between the date of perihelion and solistice shifts with one day every 57 or 58 years. This has caused the solar flux on the Earth at the time of vernal spring to increase with 0.24 per cent since 1750. This is significant when compared with the apparent AGW contribution of 0.12 (AR4) or 0.17 per cent (AR5). The increased insolation results in earlier snow melting, which again changes the albedo such that more heat from the Sun is absorbed. This is a non-linear effect that adds heat to the Earth. Steele (2014) has shown that the insolation changes because of Earth orbit change used in climate models are wrongly modeled, and the result as he writes is \u201cworse than useless\u201d, and this needs to be corrected before a difference between the solar forcing around 1750 and now can be realistic estimated in climate models., 359488=Van Haren, R.

Lett. 36, L19704., 41086=6. Solar radiative forcing FRS and change in total solar irradiance dS are different things and the difference needs to be clear when putting TSI changes into context. The two are related by FRS = dS *(1-A)/4 where A is Earth\u2019s albedo and the factor 4 arises because TSI is power per unit area of the disc presented to the Sun by the Earth and radiative forcing in per unit surface area of Earth. The albedo is not known well (let alone its variation with time) and is impossible to measure properly because every point of the Earth\u2019s surface/atmosphere reflects and scatters the incoming sunlight incident upon it in every direction back into space. Our best estimate of A is somewhere near 1/3, which means FRS \u2248 dS /6. The largest estimates of dS since 1750 are around 6 Wm-2 [Shapiro et al., 2011] which therefore corresponds to FRS \u2248 1 Wm-2 . However, most recent estimates of dS are in the range 0.6-0.9 Wm-2 which corresponds to FRS between about 0.1 and 0.15 Wm-2. In contrast the radiative forcing caused by changes in well-mixed greenhouse gasses over the same interval is relatively well known at 3.2 \u00b1 1.2 Wm-2. Thus the largest estimate in TSI change is about 30% of the known greenhouse radiative forcing, the mean of a basket of recent estimates is about 4%., 291512=Thorne, P. W., D. E. Parker, J. R.

(This discussed RSS error ensembles)., 326477=What I can say from the standpoint of applying the scientific method to a robust response-feature of models, is that the average model result is inconsistent with the observed rate of change of tropical tropospheric temperature - inconsistent both in absolute magnitude and in vertical structure (Douglass and Christy 2013.) This indicates our ignorance of the climate system is still enormous and, as suggested by Stevens and Bony, this performance by the models indicates we need to go back to the basics. From this statement there is only a short distance to the next - the use of climate models in policy decisions is, in my view, not to be recommended at this time., 305905=References Allen, R. J., S.

Journal of Geophysical Research 111, (2006) D12106. doi:10.1029/ 2005JD006548., 175839=More recently, as data improves in both quantity and quality, and helped by better understanding of aerosol effects, it is widely agreed that the gradual warming of the climate system points to a sensitivity somewhere at the low end of the traditional IPCC range (e.g. Aldrin et al 2012, Ring et al 2012, Otto et al 2013). One important limitation of these methods is that they typically assume a rather idealised low-dimensional and linear system in which the surface temperature can be adequately represented by global or perhaps hemispheric averages. In reality the transient pattern of warming is likely to be a little different from the equilibrium result, which complicates the relationship between observed and future (equilibrium) warming (e.g. Armour et al 2014)., 110319=A fair part of the warming after 1990 may be due to the cleaning of the stratosphere of aerosols after the Pinatubo eruption in 1992. Observation of earthshine during lunar eclipses shows that the atmosphere now is very clean (Keen 2008; 2013) The difference in volcanic Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOD) since 1996 is estimated to \u0394\u03c4 = -0.033 which corresponds to \u0394T=0.13\u00b0C (no feedback calculation). This is based on the relation between aerosol forcing and optical depth Fa \u2248 -21 \u0394\u03c4, where Fa is the forcing in Wm-2 (Hansen et al. 2000)., 59966=Figure 4: (a).

A bootstrap test was employed, resampling the sets of winters in order to estimate the sampling uncertainty, to test whether the solar pattern in a was different from that associated with the NAO in b: this found that the two patterns are significantly different at the 93% level [from Woollings et al. 2010]., 282786=Fig. 2. Scatter plot of trend (1979-2012) in TTT as a function of trend in TSurf. The model results cluster around a line with a slope of 1.45, indicating a tropospheric hotspot. For the observed results, HadCRUT4 is used for the surface temperatures, and various sources of tropospheric temperature (Satellites, Radiosondes, and Reanalysis) are used to TTT., 301962=Moreover, the discrepancy with models was opposite from 1958-1979 (Gaffen et al. 2000)\u2014that is to say, the observed tropical upper-tropospheric warming was evidently stronger than expected. But the world was warming then too. So if this interesting phenomenon is real, it probably is not connected to global warming., 84315=Figure 3A shows the good performance of an empirical model for the global surface temperature proposed by Scafetta (2013b). This model has the peculiarity of attempting a reconstruction of the climate variability using 6 identified solar-astronomical oscillations at periods of 9.1, 10.4, 20, 60, 115 and 983 year. Other harmonics are likely present. These oscillations are able to model the natural decadal-to-millennial natural climatic oscillations. To this harmonic component it is necessary to add an estimate of the anthropogenic and volcano components made by properly attenuating the CMIP5 general circulation model ensemble mean simulation by a factor \u03b2 \u2248 0.5 to simulate a climate sensitivity to CO2 doubling of about 1.5oC . Scafetta (2013b) showed that his model outperforms all CMIP5 general circulation models in reconstructing the global surface temperature record. Figure 3B shows a detail with an update of the semi-empirical astronomical model proposed by Scafetta (2012b) in 2011 against the HadCRUT3 global surface temperature record (Brohan, 2006). The red curve shows the original global surface temperature record published in Scafetta (2012b), which ended in October 2011. The blue curve shows the global surface temperature updated to the most current available month, which is May 2014. The back curve within the cyan 1-\u03c3 error area is the semi-empirical astronomical model forecast (which was modelled to start in 2000). The figure clearly shows that the proposed semi-empirical model outperforms the IPCC 2007 CMIP3 general circulation model projections (green area) and has successfully forecast the temperature trend from October 2011 to March 2014. Note that a simplified version of the same model was proposed by Scafetta since 2009 (Lorenzetto, 2009; Scafetta, 2010)., 72384=For example, Douglass and Clader (2002); Lean and Rind (2009); van Loon and Labitzke (2000); Scafetta (2009); Scafetta (2013c) evaluated the signature of the 11-year solar cycle on the temperature by simultaneously filtering off the volcano signature, the anthropogenic signature and the ENSO oscillations. These authors found that during the period from 1980 to 2000, which experienced very large 11-year solar oscillations, the 11-year solar cycle signature on the global surface temperature had an amplitude of about 0.1 K. At higher altitudes, however, the amplitude of the 11-year solar signature increases up to \u223c 0.4 K (e.g.: Scafetta, 2013c; van Loon and Labitzke, 2000; Svensmark and Friis-Christensen, 2007)., 167091=Others argue that the main limit on ECS is that it has to be consistent with palaeoclimatic data which point at ranges being consistent with the IPCC-range (Palaeosens, 2012, also mentioned in figure 1) and also in line with climate models likely range of about 2 to 4.5 0C (CMIP5). Some argue that palaeoclimatic data points to values in the upper part of the IPCC range (Hansen, 2013). In this dialogue we therefore want to focus first on the following two questions:, 355193=Biosketch Bart van den Hurk has a PhD on land surface modelling, obtained in Wageningen in 1996.

Before going too far with this, however, I wanted to assure myself that the reported trends were robust, and began my own analysis of the radiosonde data (or in fact continued it, since I was already using radiosondes to understand change in the lower stratosphere). By 2005, based on my own work and others\u2019 plus a better understanding of the basic challenges, I no longer thought there was credible evidence for any unexpected changes in atmospheric temperature structure. Consequently I dropped this as a research topic (my student who was thinking along these lines, Bob Allen, changed gears to examine the possible impacts of aerosol on the general circulation which did lead to some very interesting results published later; he also showed that wind trends in the tropics were consistent with the hot spot)., 63795=Fr\u00f6hlich, C.

(This describes the RICH dataset), 109242=However, this does not include effects of the longer cycles in TSI which peak around 1940 and 1995 (Figs 3 and 4), and the longer period of about 200 yr (fig 5), which controls the length of solar cycles. The change from shorter to longer cycles happened about the year 2000, and if one assume that a longer cycle imply more time for cooling, then the effect will appear some decades ahead. This is the same delayed effect we observe in the yearly cycle of warming/cooling of the Earth. In the Northern Hemisphere we have the minimum solar insolation on Dec 21, but the average temperature minimum appears on Feb 11, which is about 13 per cent time delay with respect to the yearly cycle. Power spectrum analyses of global and hemispherical temperature series shows that 60 and 20 yrs quasi-periodic oscillations are much stronger than the 11 yr sunspot period, and can be attributed to periodic forcing from the mayor planets Jupiter and Saturn (Scafetta 2013). These periods may dominate in the coming decades when the effects of the 11-yr cycle is reduced., 86783=As Figures 3 and 4 show, the proposed model has correctly predicted the observed continued standstill of the global surface temperature while the CMIP3 and CMIP5 general circulation models adopted by the IPCC in 2007 and 2013 predicted for the period 2000-2014 a strong warming of about 2oC/century, which has not been observed., 92945=Parker et al.

Two sources of measured data (I realize that a reanalysis is not really a measurement), STAR and MERRA, are reasonably close to the fitted line, while others, such as the HADAT Radiosonde dataset and the UAH satellite dataset, are far from the line. Other datasets are distributed in between. Note that the RSS data point has error bars both in the X and Y direction. These are 90% uncertainty ranges derived from the error ensembles that have been recently produced for the RSS dataset (Mears et al., 2011) and the HadCRUT4 dataset (Morice et al, 2012). (These error ensembles are made up of different realizations of the datasets that are consistent with the estimated errors, including measurement, sampling, and construction errors.

Actually, even as far back as 2002, there was enough data to provide useful estimates such as the 1.3-4.2\u00b0C of Forest et al (2002), but these results were unfortunately ignored in favour of methods which have since been shown to generate an inappropriate focus on higher values (Annan and Hargreaves 2011)., 133438=Harrison, R.

A., 467, 2777, 2011., 176629=GCM ensemble-based constraints Some (including me) have tried to generate constraints based on creating an ensemble of GCM simulations in which parameters of the GCM are varied, and then the models are generally evaluated against observations in some way to see which seem more likely. Unfortunately, the results of these experiments seem to be highly dependent on the underlying GCM, as was first shown by Yokohata et al 2010 and has also been confirmed by others (Klocke et al 2011). Therefore, I no longer consider such methods to be of much use. The underlying problem here appears to be that changing parameters within a given GCM structure does not adequately represent our uncertainty regarding the climate system. An alternative which might have the potential to overcome this problem is to use the full CMIP3/CMIP5 ensemble of climate models from around the world. These models generate a much richer range of behaviour, though debate still rages as to whether this range is really adequate or not (and for what purposes)., 243112=Forest, C.E., P.H. Stone and A.P.

Phys., 71, 066801, 2008., 140695=Unfortunately, Clette et al (2014), of which I am coauthor, has revealed several problems in the current GSN. The most important is that the reference series (obtained from the solar program at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, RGO, started in 1874) is not homogeneous in its early years. I presented Figure 2 in the 2nd Sunspot Number Workshop (Brussels, May 2012, see Cliver et al., 2013). This figure shows the ratio between the sunspot group counts of RGO and the main sunspot observers in the last quarter of the 19th century. All ratios present a positive trend. Therefore, sunspot counts by RGO are low in the first years of this Figure 2 and high in the last years in comparison with the rest of observers. Therefore, RGO counts are not homogeneous in these times. However, RGO was chosen by Hoyt and Schatten (1998) as the prime observer due to the prestigiousness of its solar program. This causes lower GSN values before 1880 because the calibration constant of the observers were adjusted using these first years and the error was propagated back., 377914=[15] Evans J, Ekstr\u00f6m M, Ji F (2012) Evaluating the performance of a WRF physics ensemble over South-East Australia.

The interaction of aerosols with the entire array of climate processes is another fundamental area of research that has more questions than answers. How do aerosols affect cloudiness (more?, less?, brighter?, darker?). What is the precise, time-varying distribution of all types of aerosols and what exactly does each type do in terms of affecting the absorption and reflection of the joules in all frequencies? The IPCC typically shows very large error ranges for our knowledge of the aerosol effects, so there is a possibility that models have significant and consistent errors in dealing with them (IPCC 2007 AR4 Fig SPM.2)., 22672=Figure 9: The group sunspot numbers (in blue) suggest a steady increase in solar activity since the Maunder Minimum.

Some solar model predicts a variability significantly larger than others. Figure 1B simply compares the Central England Temperature record (Parker et al., 1992) and the solar reconstruction proposed by Hoyt and Schatten (1997).

Some of these studies have claimed that the Sun could have contributed at least \u223c 50% of the post 1850 global warming. This conclusion contradicts the current analytical climate models, such as the general circulation models (GCMs) adopted by the IPCC that predict only a 5% or lower solar contribution to the warming observed during the same period (e.g. see the IPCC (2013))., 290836=Q.

This being the case, we would expect the average TSI around 1900 and around 1750 to be very similar to the 2009 value, i.e. 1365.77 Wm-2, which gives a change in TSI between 1750 and 1980 (the peak of the running-mean of the TSI observations) of (1366.15 -1365.77) = 0.38 Wm-2., 449020=8.

However, it was not found by Clette et al (2014) using the data provided by Hoyt and Schatten (1998). According to Leussu et al (2013), this breakpoint around 1848 was caused by the change of the primary observer from Schwabe to Wolf and, probably, an inappropriate individual correction factor used for Schwabe in the ISN.

The mean observational result indicates the values are between +0.5 and +1.5 through the lower and middle troposphere (850 to 250 hPa). [The observational results tend to have greater variability due to the denominator (surface trend) being relatively small. Viewing Fig. 2 shows that the observations are rather tightly bunched for absolute trends in comparison to the model spread.] The models indicate a systematic increase in the ratio from 1.0 at the surface with amplification factors well above +1.5 from 500 to 200 hPa. What this figure clearly indicates is that the second aspect of this discussion, i.e. namely the rising temperatures with increasing altitude, is also over-done in the climate models.

In several instances, decadal trends in observations have been at or beyond the LE range including intervals of exceptional observed warming (1945, 1960, 1980) and cooling (1948, 2009). The extent to which these frequent departures from the LE reflect errors in observations, insufficient ensemble size, or biases in model internal variability remains unknown. Nonetheless, there is no clear evidence of the model sensitivity being systematically biased high. Also noteworthy is the fact that the LE suggests that due to forcing, as indicated by the ensemble mean, certain decades including the 2000s are predisposed to a reduced rate of surface warming., 92607=Lorenzetto (2009), Lorenzetto, S.: Se la Terra si surriscalda colpa del Sole: l\u2019uomo non c\u2019entra.

Models with multiple runs have separate boxplots; models with single runs are grouped together in the boxplot marked \u2018singleton\u2019. The orange boxplot at the right combines all model runs together. The red dotted line shows the actual increase in global surface temperature over the same period per the HadCRUT4 observational dataset., 201437=The LE also allows for the evaluation of subsets of ensemble members, such as in Fig 2, where the planetary imbalances for the ten ensemble members with the greatest global surface warming (red) and cooling (blue) trends from 2000-2010 are compared. It is found that no significant difference exists between the two distributions and the mean imbalance for the cooling members is actually greater than for the warming members. Thus the finding of a relatively unchanged planetary imbalance during the recent hiatus period is entirely consistent with analogous periods in LE simulations. While the LE does suggest that recent trends have been exceptional, this is also suggested by the instrumental record itself, which includes exceptional El Ni\u00f1o (1997-98) and La Ni\u00f1a events (2010-2012) at the bounds of the recent hiatus., 388256=\u00b7 provide projections of future climate change on two time scales, near term (out to about 2035) and long term (out to 2100 and beyond), and, 143523=In any case, note that the results presented by Clette et al.

Geophysical Research Letters 36 (2009) L01808., 348103=But also here, RCMs can be of great help, not necessarily by providing reliable predictions, but also by supporting evidence about the salience of planned measures or policies (Berkhout et al, 2013). A nice example is a near flooding situation in Northern Netherlands (January 2012), caused by a combined occurrence of a saturated soil due to excessive antecedent precipitation, a heavy precipitation event in the coastal area and a storm surge with a duration of several days that hindered the discharge of excess water from the area. This is typically a \u201creal weather\u201d event that is not necessarily exceptional but does expose a local vulnerability to superfluous water. The question asked by the local water managers was whether the combination of the individual events (wet soil, heavy rain, storm surge) has a causal relationship, and whether the frequency of occurrence of compound events can be expected to change in the future. Observational analyses do suggest a link between heavy precipitation and storm surge, but the available dataset was too short to explore the statistical relationships in a relevant part of the frequency distribution. A large set of RCM simulations is now explored to increase the statistical sample, but \u2013 more importantly \u2013 to provide a physically comprehensive picture of the boundary conditions leading up to an event like this. By enabling the policy makers to communicate this physically comprehensive picture provides public support for measures undertaken to adapt to this kind of events. This exploration of model based \u2013 synthetic \u2013 future weather is a powerful method to assess the consequences of possible changes in regional climate variability for the local water management., 116982=Keen, R., Volcanoes and Climate since 1960: what does the Moon have to say? 2008 http://lasp.colorado.edu/sorce/news/2008ScienceMeeting/doc/Session4/S4_05_Keen.pdf , Updated at NOAA Earth System research Lab Global Monitoring Annual Conference, May 21.22, 2013, Boulder, Col., 9099=The estimated increase in radiative forcing due to the sun since 1750 is only 0.05 W/m2 compared to a total increase that is mainly caused by greenhouse gases of 2.29 W/m2.

The three participants agree that LTP exists in the climate (Table 1), but they disagree about the exact definition and the physical processes that lie behind it. Benestad and Bunde describe LTP in terms of \u201clong memory\u201d. Koutsoyiannis holds the opinion that LTP is mainly the result of the irregular and unpredictable changes that take place in the climate (Table 2). Both Bunde and Koutsoyiannis are in favour of a formal (mathematical) definition of LTP, which states that on longer time scales climate variability decreases\u2014but not as much as implied by classical statistics. If the temperature of this year is not related to that of last year or next year we can use statistics to determine whether the increase in global temperature is significant or not. In such an \u201cuncorrelated climate\u201d, i.e. if the temperature of this year is fully independent of other years, the average value becomes zero (or a fixed value) quickly and deviations from the mean last only shortly.
