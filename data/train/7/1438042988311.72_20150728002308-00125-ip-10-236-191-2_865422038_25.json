    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{7548=New Japan had an annual tournament since 1974 under various names: the World League (1974\u201377, based on the World (Big) League tournament from the old Japanese Wrestling Association held between 1959 and 1972);[1][2][3][4][5] the MSG League (1978\u201382);[6][7][8][9][10] the International Wrestling Grand Prix (IWGP) League (1983\u201388; although the first winner, Hulk Hogan, was awarded a championship belt, this is not the beginning of the IWGP Heavyweight Championship).[5][11][12][13][14][15] Most of these tournaments were dominated by New Japan's founding top star, Antonio Inoki. In 1989, there was a World Cup Tournament, which included wrestlers from the then-Soviet Union.[5][16] No tournament was held in 1990., 2268=Unlike the New Japan Cup, the G1 Climax features the then-reigning IWGP Heavyweight Champion as one of the participants, except in 1992, 2001, 2004 and 2008, when then-champions Riki Ch\u014dsh\u016b (in 1992), Kazuyuki Fujita (in 2001 and 2004), and Keiji Mutoh (in 2008), respectively, did not compete in the tournament. Often being labeled as a favorite to win the tournament, the IWGP Champion has reached the final five times, the first one being in 1995 when Keiji Mutoh won the tournament. Mutoh would repeat this feat again in 1999, but would lose the final to Manabu Nakanishi. Other then-reigning champions to reach the final include Kensuke Sasaki in 2000, Kazuyuki Fujita in 2005 and Yuji Nagata in 2007. Mutoh and Sasaki are the only two wrestlers to have won the G1 Climax while holding the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. Overall, Antonio Inoki holds the record for most tournament wins with ten, while Masahiro Chono with his five wins holds the record for most tournament wins under its G1 Climax name. Hiroyoshi Tenzan has taken part in the G1 Climax tournament a record 19 times., 4135=With Inoki's dominance over New Japan gone, the promotion established the G1 Climax tournament in 1991 as a platform to showcase the company's top heavyweights and have them compete in round robin matches where the winners of the two divisions would then square off in the tournament finals. The first G1 was held from August 7 to August 11, 1991 at Tokyo's Ry\u014dgoku Kokugikan. The winner of the tournament, assuming they are not already the champion, has traditionally earned a shot at the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. Since 2012, the winner has earned a contract for a title shot at New Japan's largest event, Wrestle Kingdom in Tokyo Dome, held annually on January 4, that they then have to defend until the end of the year.[5][17][18], 8990=The G1 (Grade One) Climax is a professional wrestling tournament held each August by the New Japan Pro Wrestling promotion. The G1 draws standing room only crowds each night, record receipt gates and generates front-page coverage on the sports sections of several of the daily newspapers in Tokyo. Though it has sometimes been held as a single-elimination tournament, it is usually (and currently) held as a round-robin, with winners from two blocks wrestling in the final to decide that year's winner. In its current format, the tournament lasts between one to two weeks. The winner of each block is determined by a points system; two points for a victory, one point for a draw, and zero points for a loss.}",

It returned to the format of 2003, eliminating the \"quarterfinals\" seen in 2004, and simply bringing each block's top two scorers into the final four.[35], 188093=The 1994 G1 Climax returned to the round-robin format, this time with two blocks of six. It was held from August 3 to August 7, 1994.

Taking place over 19 shows, it will be the longest G1 Climax in history.[106] The finals take place back at Ry\u014dgoku Kokugikan.[107] Participants in the tournament were announced on June 7.[108] For the tournament, NJPW introduced a new format, where each show would only include five tournament matches all from the same block, giving the other participants more time to rest.[109] Shinsuke Nakamura injured his left elbow in his second match, forcing him to forfeit his third match against Michael Elgin.[110], 210391=The 1996 G1 Climax was held from August 2 to August 6, 1996, and was a round-robin tournament featuring two blocks of five.[20][26] Junji Hirata suffered an injury during his match with Kensuke Sasaki, which caused him to forfeit his remaining matches., 75492=The 1984 International Wrestling Grand Prix ran from May 11 to June 14, 1984. The tournament featured 12 wrestlers, and was the first time that the tournament featured no sort of final round.[12][20], 40991=The 1977 World League ran from April 21 to May 30, 1977. The tournament featured 11 wrestlers.[4][20], 462071=The 2011 version of the G1 Climax tournament was announced on May 3, 2011. It took place over ten shows between August 1 and August 14, 2011, and included 20 participants, making it at the time the largest G1 Climax in history.[57][58], 50569=The 1979 MSG League ran from April 27 to June 7, 1979. The tournament featured 10 wrestlers.[7][20], 501444=The 2012 version of the G1 Climax tournament took place over nine shows between August 1 and August 12, 2012 and included 18 participants.[68][69] The 24-year old Kazuchika Okada went on to become the youngest G1 Climax winner in history, breaking the previous record held by the then-27-year old Masahiro Chono.[42] Okada also became the first winner since Hirooki Goto to win the tournament in his first attempt.[42] Karl Anderson became the first foreigner to make it to the finals of the tournament since Rick Rude in 1992.[70], 60211=The 1981 MSG League ran from May 8 to June 4, 1981. The tournament featured 11 wrestlers.[9][20], 378900=The 2006 G1 Climax was a 10-man round-robin tournament held from August 6 to August 13.[36], 137771=The 1992 G1 Climax was a 16-man single-elimination tournament, and was also for the vacant NWA World Heavyweight Championship. It ran from August 6 to August 12, 1992.[20][22] Terry Taylor advanced to the quarterfinals, due to a shoulder injury suffered by his scheduled opponent Hiroshi Hase on August 3., 45789=The 1978 MSG League ran from April 21 to May 30, 1978. The tournament featured nine wrestlers.[6][20], 34030=The 1976 World League ran from April 2 to May 11, 1976. The tournament featured 14 wrestlers.

As well as the increased number of participants, it introduced a format in which the second and third runner-ups from each block would advance to a four-man tournament, the two finalists of which would advance to a second four-man tournament also featuring each block winner; the eventual winner of this tournament would win the G1 Climax. Also, it would seem that, for this particular year, matches which ended in a double countout or double disqualification would result in zero points for both competitors.[34], 322072=The 2003 G1 Climax was another 12-man round-robin tournament, held from August 10 to August 17.

Like the previous year, all events in the tournament were made available on iPPV through Niconico and Ustream.[92] Kota Ibushi was scheduled to take part in the tournament, but on July 18 New Japan announced that he would have to pull out due to a concussion suffered at the beginning of the month.[93] The following day, Tomoaki Honma was named Ibushi's replacement in the tournament.[94], 162754=The 1993 G1 Climax was once again a 16-man single-elimination tournament, held from August 3 to August 7, 1993.
