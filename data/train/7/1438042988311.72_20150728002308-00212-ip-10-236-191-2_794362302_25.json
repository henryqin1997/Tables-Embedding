In 1955, no species with a chromosome number 2n = 22 or its multiple other than P. somniferum and P. setigerum was grown by us, and \"Ikkanshu\" was cultivated in the adjoining field to the female parent at our experiment station., 249831=In Table VI the laboratory analyses are given for Japanese opiums of the crop season of 1953/54, and in Table VII analyses are Summarized for the crop season of 1954/55., 135098=The poppies were sown in October 1954 and 1955 and grown under uniform cultural conditions at the Kasukabe Experiment Station (numbers 1 to 26, 58 to 98) and the Wakayama Experiment Station (numbers 27 to 57).

At the first meiotic metaphase in the pollen mother cell (PMC), 11 bivalent and 11 univalent chromosomes were observed (fig. 4).

The capsules were incised in the evening and the latex was gathered just after incision (\" Kiritori\" collection) and the following morning (\" Oigaki\" collection). The opiums thus obtained were mixed, as is the usual practice in collecting commercial opium from P.somniferum. Three or four incisiom, each covering a quarter of the capsule, were made at intervals of one day, till no more latex was yielded. The first incision began ten days after the petals had fallen. In experiment I it began at different dates in the sequence of flowering, irrespective of the strains, whereas in experiment II all sets of incisions made began on the same date. Each incision consisted of four longitudinal slashes. There were plants with violet flowers and also plants with mauve flowers in the strain. In experiment I both kinds were used without separating them, whereas in experiment II only plants with violet flowers were used. With this in mind, the following two experiments, experiment I and experiment II, were made in successive years. The seeds were sown in October 1954 and 1955. The flowering continued almost throughout May of the following year. This investigation was undertaken to grow and identify botanically P. setigerum, and to determine quantitatively the content of alkaloids in the opium from this poppy plant. For actual production of opium only P. somniferum has been cultivated, and there is no history of the cultivation of",
