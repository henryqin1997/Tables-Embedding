    "textBeforeTable": "As a runner, moisture is your foot's worst enemy. Moisture causes blisters, discomfort, Athlete's Foot and allows odor causing bacteria to flourish. However you also know your feet are going to get wet, either from sweating, stepping in a puddle, running across wet grass or getting caught in the rain. You can even get splashed at a race water station and instead of the water going in you, it goes on you. The Running Lite-Mesh Socks were designed with a special Dual Layer Moisture Removal System that moves moisture off the skin through the inner Drymax layer to the outer absorbent layer almost instantly. Running Lite-Mesh Socks are a low density protective padded sock. They have a dense padding, as opposed to thick padding, so they protect feet without adversely affecting the fit of the shoes. Running Lite-Mesh Socks are designed to be used in mild to warm conditions, keeping feet cool, dry, comfortable and odor free. 3D Advanced Fit Drymax's five sock sizes fit because they were developed on special 3D shaped foot models. Each size sock includes a (S, M, L, XL, or XXL) color size mark for easy match-up after laundering. Sizing Click to watch a Drymax sock demonstration",
    "textAfterTable": "Anti-blister System Several features work together as an anti-blister system to actively prevent the formation of blisters. 1) Exceptional 3D fit, 2) Five sock sizes, 3) Seamless insides, 4) An instep-hugging arch band, and 5) Because Drymax socks stay dry, the skin stays dry too; therefore blisters normally caused by sweat or sweat vapor are prevented. Cooler Feet Our v3 Drymax Running Socks possess top and bottom mesh air vents designed to keep feet drier & cooler by working with the built-in vent systems in the new generation of breathable running shoes made by Adidas (Clima Cool), Asics, Diadora (Power Flow), Fila, Mizuno (Intercool), New Balance (N-Vent), Nike, and Reebok. Active Odor Control The MicroZap\u00ae antimicrobial in the Drymax\u00ae Fibers is a silver - zirconium phosphate ceramic ion-exchange resin. It fights odor-causing bacteria, helping keep socks odor free. Not a topical treatment; MicroZap is molecularly infused into our Drymax fibers. Being non-migratory and non-toxic, MicroZap provides long term Active Odor Control. Long Lasting Comfort, Durability & Looks The special fibers used in our Drymax Socks have a comfortable springiness and do not get stiff, shrink or lose shape over time. The whites are crisp and the colors never dull. They are designed to last a long time using the highest quality fibers, and abrasion resistant nylon fiber reinforcements in the normal wear areas.
