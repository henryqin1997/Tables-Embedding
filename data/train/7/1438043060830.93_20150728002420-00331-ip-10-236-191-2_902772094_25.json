            "Albany State is one of the safest campuses in the nation. Google it if you .don't believe me. The campus has it's own police department on campus that is completely separate from the city's. The officers are always on patrol and you can call at anytime.",
            "Well I'm a freshman so idk much. Just don't step on any of the plots of the Greek organizations if you're not one of them.",
            "There are sororities and fraternities. Several sports teams. Student government. Musical clubs. Science clubs. Chess club. Religious clubs. And don't be afraid to start your own club.",
            "All students. Nerds, preps, loners, thespians, religious. College isn't about labels. Especially not this one.",
            "ASU is nicknamed The Unsinkable because it was hit by the flood of '94. There is a chimney stack in the middle of the campus. It is the remains of one the original buildings. There is a mark on the chimney that shows how high the water rose. The school is very historical.",
            "Albany State University is one of the few HBCUs in GA. It is well known for it's academics. Even so it is one of the less expensive colleges you'll find. You get a top notch education for reasonable prices. An in state student staying on campus with 12 credit hours will pay about 6K a semester which is not bad at all for a four year school. A private school will be twice as much for the exact same education.",
            "There is always something going on at ASU. Be it movie night on the yard, pep rallies, or seminars. There are also things hosted by the school at places on the town. This year i attended ASU bowling night and skate night. I mentioned the parties earlier. I am not a party person but there is always a party somewhere in Albany and you will hear about them! I almost forgot there are several clubs on campus. Science clubs, political clubs, and fine arts clubs are just a few types. There is something for everyone.",
            "LOVE IT!!! At ASU the food in the cafeteria is awesome. There are six stations: The Deli (where you have sandwiches), Home Style (the kind of stuff your mom would cook), The Grill, The Pizza Line, Desert Bar, and Salad Bar. The breakfast is pretty good too. There's a station for cereal, one for coffee, one for fruit, and the hot breakfast is served in the Home Style line. Now besides the Caf there are a few restaurants on campus. They include: Chic-fil-a, Pizza Hut, Subway and Einstein's. All of them have great food.",
            "Freshman who aren't from the area are required to live on campus. I am from the town so I wasn't required to but I wanted to get the full experience of college life. It is definitely something new. Living with a roommate isn't easy and it's part of the reason I am currently living at home for my second semester. However, dorms do give you the chance to meet new people and make new friends. You also learn alot about yourself. The dorm advisors are pretty cool and they are very helpful. Every student should live on campus at least one semester because it is quite an experience.",
            "I am a biology major which is one of the harder majors. The work load isn't heavy at all but the complexity is heavy. College is definitely more challenging than high school. Waiting til the last minute is suicide. And if you're a chemistry major well you might wanna request the Xanax from your doctor before you get to college.",
            "1) Don't be nervous. The upperclassmen are very friendly and helpful 2) Don't be shy. Like I said most people there are chill. 3) Get to know your professors and your advisors 4) Avoid anything before 9 a.m. 5) Try to take at least 15 hours per semester if you're not planning on doing summer school, otherwise you can get away with 12. 6) It's a party town. Don't try to go out every night. There will always be another party. 7) Procrastination will have you crying at 3 a.m. Do the work ahead of time 8) Be yourself.",
            "Albany State University is located in a medium sized town. It is a nice sized school not too big not too small. The campus isn't confusing at all; it's very easy to navigate"

Albany is an historic black college so it has it's traditonally dorms wiley and gibson that has community bathrooms,but all the other dorms or more modern. The newest dorms was built fall 2011, 202485=One trademark Albany State University has is the chimney. In 1994, the city of Albany experienced a massive flood. It wiped out the whole campus, except for the chimney that was connected to our first academic hall, Caroline Hall. The chimney has three rings around it, representing the height of the flood each day it got higher. Now, the campus is migrating to the higher part of the land. We have a bridge over the pedestrian mall that has a message written on both sides. If you're walking towards the higher side of campus, the bridge says: A past to cherish. If you're walking to the lower side it says: A future to fulfill., 276269=I've been staying on campus since Fall 2010. I love it! I wouldn't trade it for nothing. You learn more and get that college feel on staying in the doors. From the pranks in the wee hours of the mornings to the random fire drills., 42974=We have a new student center that was built and opened the fall of 2011 its where a lot people go to talk with friends, many of the events are held in this building or outside in the amphitheatre, 116730=spring 2012 is my first semester off campus. when i was on campus the dorm life was i say ok. every now and then you would get students partying late make alot of noise outside, but it is ok., 13409=Albany is a small city so it can take some time to get used to if your not from a small city yourself. It can get cold during late November and early December so please be prepared. Also, you must have transportation because most places are not walking distance., 311960=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 19442=I advise prospective students to apply around October 1 of their senior year. To set yourself apart from the rest I implore that you submit a resume and a 1 page essay of yourself (be creative)., 125749=At Albany State we call our dinning are The Caf.Our caf is brand new, just opened January of 2012. In the care we have four different line and a salad bar. The food in the caf is usually pretty good.}",
