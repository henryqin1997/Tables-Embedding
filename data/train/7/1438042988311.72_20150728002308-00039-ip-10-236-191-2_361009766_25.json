    "textAfterTable": "While blue frogs do exist in nature (witness the Blue Poison Dart species), they aren't exactly common. Likewise, the Blue Frog Bar & Grill in trendy River North is an extremely rare and endangered species: a down and dirty, festive, family-run dive in an area of the city where martinis with an attitude have long been in vogue. Blue Frog has been in business for almost 20 years, but finding it is half the battle. I spent six month living in the neighborhood before I noticed the place and another year until my curiosity led me to the not-so-easy-to-find door. The bar is set back behind a parking lot (not theirs) at the corner of Huron and LaSalle. A rusting placard and spaghetti-thin, occasionally lit neon sign mark its existence, and there's a tiny outdoor patio for imbibery alfresco. It doesn't exactly flaunt itself to the many tourists wandering the area, but perhaps that's the point. I remember my wife and I blinking like a flash-grenade had detonated, upon our first visit to Blue Frog. With much affection, the interior of Blue Frog looks like a garage sale threw up, with most of the regurgitated contents stuck to the ceiling. Patrons enter a smallish rectangular room, with a beaten bar running along the short end of the wall to the left, and a dozen tables of varying heights left and center. A pink door marks the lady's room,",
