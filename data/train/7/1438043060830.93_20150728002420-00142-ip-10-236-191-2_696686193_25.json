And yet, often we get sucked into petty arguments because we forget just how different we are. For instance, men have been conditioned to think that a big breasted lady that is wearing an extremely revealing top is doing so because she craves attention. Although true in some instances, that logic is quite flawed. Where men typically utilize a logical line of thinking (to them), women go more by feel.\u00a0 For instance, Richard might have a date with Jezzebel on Saturday at 3:00 pm which will involve walking around the boat ports. Saturday afternoon, around 1:00 pm, Richard realizes there is an insane amount of heat outside. Consequently, he decides to rock his blue jean shorts, Air Force One\u2019s and a throwback Wilt Chamberlain jersey (which probably means Richard is going for a record tonight if you know what I mean). Jezzebel on the other hand, has this new pair of high heels that she\u2019s been dying to wear to go along with a short black skirt and white tank top.\u00a0 Richard understands that he will be walking around in hot weather, and therefore chooses clothes that will not store heat and also allow him to be comfortable while walking. Jezzebel on the other hand, will be walking around but chose a pair of high heels that she has not yet broken in. Consequently, the walking will not last long because Jezzebel\u2019s feet will hurt like crazy. She went by feel whereas Richard went by logic. Hence, men and women will always be destined to argue unless\u2026., 109404=* \u201cI don't follow any guidelines cause too many n*ggaz ride mine, so I change styles every two rhymes.\u201d It\u2019s been 13 years since the self proclaimed God MC drops his first album. The first track on Reasonable doubt was Can\u2019t Knock the Hustle. I remember bumping that beat in high school and just feelin it. But today is a new day and Brooklyn\u2019s finest has decided to grace us with another album in his coming of age when September hits. I wonder if he will be taking shots at The Game on this new LP; because we all know that friend or foe, S\u00a0, 5180=* Those that know me well, know that I am a big Joe Budden fan. Jump Off Joey and I get along quite nicely when I am bumping his tracks. Consequently, when Joe decided to hook up with Royce da 5\u20199, Joel Ortiz and Crooked I to form the group Slaughterhouse, I became fan of the movement. Well ladies and gentlemen, the album hits stores on August 11. Obviously, the SBG blog has connects and was able to secure an advanced copy of the album, and it\u2019s the bomb. The first track I heard on the album (besides \u201cThe One\u201d which was the lead single on the album) was \u201cSound Off\u201d; and boy that\u2019s exactly what they do. Royce opens up the track explaining that Slaughterhouse is like Voltron and then proceeds to associate each group member to a body part of Voltron. I\u2019m not saying you have to buy the album, but try to listen to some of the tracks., 104328=*I am officially 11-0 in my Madden football season. My Indianapolis Colts have all the fire power I need thanks to Peyton Manning but my defense had some huge glaring weaknesses. After eight regular season games, I was only able to generate four sacks. FOUR SACKS!!! I was headed to have eight sacks after the end of the regular season. But you know what? Homie don\u2019t get down like that. I pulled off Pau Gasol style trade. I went to the negotiation table with the San Diego Chargers and offered them my 1st round draft pick and weak ass linebacker Clint Sessions (no offense Clint, but you got bullied last year in the playoffs against the Chargers last year and your overall rating in the game is 64) for Shawne motherf*ckin Merriman. And you know what? The Chargers agreed! Merriman is an overall 89 as a right outside linebacker; but here\u2019s the trick: I converted him to defensive end where his rating boosts to 99. In the three games since becoming a Colt, Merriman as managed to return an interception for a touchdown, force two fumbles, and has gotten four sacks all on his own. Now that\u2019s a trade peoples (even in Madden). *NEWS ALERT: As Philly would say, we have reached a new scale of sucktitude. Allen Iverson is actually in negotiations to play with perhaps the Memphis Grizzlies, Miami Heat or Charlotte Bobcats. See, Iverson has always said that he\u2019s in the game to win titles. But when your actions clearly contradict your words, guys like me have to start asking questions right? -Refusing to play in a game with the Sixers when you\u2019re in a playoff hunt because your coach wants you to come off the bench; -Refusing to allow Carmelo to be the main guy on the Nuggets team; -Complaining about going to the bench on a team that relies on team play rather then one on one play; -Suddenly claiming to have a back injury and to be out for the season when the head coach mentions that maybe you can play the minutes of the back up point guard because you\u2019re not productive as a sixth man. See when you put all of those actions together, that screams to me that A.I. is all about A.I. Call me crazy, but if he really wanted to win a ring, he should be stalking Danny Ainge (Boston), Gregg Popovich (San Antonio), Danny Ferry (Cleveland), Otis Smith (Orlando), Steve Kerr (Phoenix), Donnie Nelson (Dallas), Bryan Colangelo (Toronto) and Mitch Kupchak (Lakers) in order to get a shot at hopping on with any of those teams. But instead he would rather shine on squad that will barely make the playoffs. That\u2019s the thing about A.I. he\u2019s all about himself (which I cannot judge nor condone) and what he can do for himself, but then will ask why others aren\u2019t willing to do for him. Good luck on that championship hunt. *Cid blesses you with some info on the Montreal club scene\u2026 -Thursday, for some it's pay day for others like me. It's W time! Located in the newly revamped Quartier International, this High class Hotel Lounge (Wunderbar) blesses you with a hip hop ambiance and a nice new age decor! I know, it's pretty lame and cheesy, but hey it's better than nothing. Meaning, it's free to get in (Yes!) and they don't really stress for the dress code (Sort of Yes!). It also presents you nice eye candy barmaids with the occasional NBSW (Never Before Seen Women) as their clientele. The crowd is mature. As mentioned earlier, it is free to get in but your name must be on the \"List\". Yeah that list that bouncers supposedly use to filter who's in and who's outside to accompany the lamp post. \"BUDGET ALERT\" make sure to bring at least 260$ (which means 2 Bruno's ex: Canadian 100.00$ bill is Bruno + 3 Green Queens ex: 20$ is Green Queen) to take a table and pop bottles with models. As soon as you have the bottle, suddenly you have a lot of people around you trying to be your friend and the gold diggers come out the closet real quick. This is called the \"Movers and Shakers Theory Right now, the Wunderbar is one of the hottest spots in Montreal to avoid disappointment come early at 11pm .Please don't think about getting a room on the spot because the cheapest room is 329$ a night. Also don't think about paying round to your wingman either, because the alcohol is very and I mean very bloody expensive. For example a cognac Courvoisier V.S costs 19.25$ txt! But there's more....wait for it!...wait for it!!!...Before tips!!! Oh and by the way remember them eye candy barmaids, they'll make sure you give her the proper tip...(Bitch where's my money!!!). Finally, you only getting an 1 oz, nothing more. Famous people seen at the W hotel: Lil Wayne after his show and Pittsburgh Penguins Superstar Sidney Crosby. Hotel W is locate 901 Square Victoria, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec H2Z 1R1 \u00c2\u00b7 Canada -Montreal aka Real-City - Canada's Party Capital, where you can do it again until 6 in the morning. This time around I'm giving you the goods on the DOME....!...Sorry, DOME 2000....Nah!! I'm talking about....CLUB OPERA Fool!!!!! All white decor with a MIAMI style ambiance. Point 1:This is one of the most beautiful clubs in Montreal! Scratch that the prettiest one in the city period! The best night I might say is Sundays..aka STAFF NIGHT. Basically, staff night is where you will find all the pretty barmaids from others clubs mingling in the crowd. This is the night where you will see strippers, gold diggers, hoes, bustas, boasters, hustlers, fake tits, everybody! Get your hands up!...My man D aka D\u2019nutz will say I just took a bite from Hova... oh well Shawn Corey Carter always bit off Biggie LOL!!! The music is mostly house but you see so many beautiful women that the music doesn't even bother you. Some might consider it as paradise aka the watering hole for predators to catch some prey..whoa!!!! too much National Geographic. On the real, pretty mature crowd minimum percentage of young lads and gals since most of them gotta hit the school benches or work the next day...hihi!. Meaning, this could be your only chance to impress some ladies so make sure you got your True Religion jeans and Ed Hardy Apparel on point. As for the Fire Water aka Alcohol, The same 1 oz of cognac that cost 20$ or as I like to call them Green Queens at W costs 8$ at Opera. Jesus!. You will be able to buy 2 rounds for your wingman and try to holla and spit at P.Y.T (Pretty Young Thang) with a cosmo. Musically talking, I prefer it on Saturdays. Point 2: When I need to soothe that Urban Music hit (aka listen to some Hip Hop), I go upstairs and relate with my main man Toddy Flores on the 1 & 2's to satisfy that hunger. You'll see people between 18-40 for sure on Saturdays.For all of you out of towners, don\u2019t forget we are in LA BELLE PROVINCE (Quebec) the legal age to drink and go out is 18!!!. On any other day this club is closed, except for special events. For instance, when my boy Jean Pascal won the world title against Adrian Diaconu aka the Shark, bottles were popped and people approached to witness. Bottom line, I have no clue how much is costs to rent that club but if you do a party, no one will complain about the beauty of the place. *Sley drops some knowledge and responds to some of my previous articles -Are your standards too high? Maybe I'm just too demanding Maybe I'm just like my father too bold Maybe I'm just like my mother, she's never satisfied (Satisfied) Classic lyrics from the Artist..The Symbol, The Icon, The man that took all his videos and joints off YOUTUBE...Punk!...PRINCE!!!!!...No More Hand Claps please! That's what it's all about nowadays, standards, knowing what you really really want, filter the residue and keep that Golden Nugget! In regards to giving face, man to each his own I guess. I mean, in ghetto terms..Boom if shorty wanna lollipop brotha man and so on and so forth..Go hard or Go home..Word to mutha B! And if God wanna bless his Wiz by eating some Power U..All the power to you dude! In all seriousness, I agree humans are complicated beings. Man Differ from Woman and vice versa, but trying to find Mister or Ms.Alright is the way to go as there is no Perfect entity to complete your search...Fool! Real talk! When you try to find a mate to build and prosper, you need to accept their imperfections. -Wingman \"Like Rae & Ghost, I'm the eyes that's in the back of you kid!\" Here's my wingman point of view: III. THE KAMIKAZEE (No pressure) That's a brotha who ain't afraid to just step and say whatever is on his mind to holla at lady love love. I know a dude, who personifies that type of brash in your face bravado. 1 on 3 1 on 4 panache. And you know what, he gets that bucket with the harm. Insane tactics in my opinion, but successful in certain ways. I mean, we all have these ego trips where we just grab and say a Biggie line: \"I'm F**king with you\". But you need the testicular fortitude to swing for the fences and also a good chin to receive the tongue lashing afterwards. Some might say, you need some liquid courage, others call it having some balls but I've seen it and one time did the KAMIKAZEE all for the good of the cause!!!! Church! IV. THE SACRIFICE (Take one for the team) Yes! I have experienced that move in my life indeed. Few summers ago, I got a call from my dudes around my way who were at Salsatheque with 3 chicas. Not necessarily Spanish, but you get the point! Anyways, they sent me a flair and asked me to come and help out on the PK (Hockey Term for Penalty Kill). Now, I'm basically being setup on a blind date either with Chubaka or Shaneyney. So I decided to ...TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM!!! Finally, I arrive and meet up with my comrades, shorty was ok...had convo, but she kept on asking if I knew certain Street Union Workers (my terminology for Gangsters). So yes, I sacrificed for my PNC's to get some action. Again, for the good of the cause!!! -Quality or Quantity? In regards to this topic, I believe my man Shyne forgot one important step...the unexplained one: THE BREAK UP STAGE aka LONE WOLF- It basically bolds down to this. After being in a relationship for a while (At Least more than 2 years) and what ever the reason, it no longer works that dude will go \"Loco in la Cabeza\". Meaning, he'll need unload ASAP. Quality is out the window, he will tap and pounce on any prey (weak minded shortys to hurt lady love loves's), just to satisfy the urges. Meaning, he'll regress and go primitive. Start going out and keep busy his alter brain to mask the pain & stress of the past break up. He'll relate with the pack of wolves more often and when he does find that quote unquote person, he might stray fearfully to avoid being hurt once again. At the end of the day, he wants to be held, but not too long...feel me! Again, as Shyne mentioned we ain't got PhD's in the subject, but we got things that can't measured...Experience papi..experience!!! Top of the day to all Cyber readers! Last night I was cruising downtown with wifey and wanted to scope out the Steve Harvey Book (Act like a Lady Think Like a man). Didn't cop it since it was freaking 31$ for 289 pages!!!! Insane in the la cabeza Cogno!!!! Amazon Canada...10$ thank you! But while wandering through the immense field of books, I saw the Karrine Steffans new book \" The Vixen Manual-How to Seduce & Keep the man you want\" Intrigued me with a sensual cover, I started flipping through the pages and saw some pretty interesting stuff ol' girl was rapping about. She really wants women to get that man girl and make everything possible to keep him from going astray. But like life in general, it's not all physical, She also tried to get the lines of communication open for convo in regards to getting the picture right about who you getting busy with as well as with your self. After I dissect and peep her science, I'll relate later with the specifics. Also, big shout out to Philly aka Oak for making the big step..Welcome to the club!!!}",
