    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{45725=New for 2013, the Gio Italia (MK) 500W electric scooter is the perfect European-inspired upgrade to our reliable daily commuter scooters. This beautiful machine takes scooter style to a new dimension, something straight out of the tight streets of Milan, where scooters own the road. Powered by a 500W peak, 350W continuous brushless electric motor, this scooter has beautiful styling to go along with easy, smooth handling and plentiful power. The 48 Volt lead-acid battery system features dual 12AH batteries and will provide 50 kilometres of range on a single charge, great for a run of daily errands or school commute. The new style features six electric metallic-paint color schemes, including neon pink, electric blue, maroon, and jet black. The seat is a beautiful, rich tan leather and the uber-cool front body and headlight design is downright sexy. The smooth Euro lines and eye-pleasing body shape assure a stylish, cool ride..\u00a0\u00a0, 46724=The 32 km/h top-speed is more than enough for getting around town on bike lanes, road shoulders, or pedestrian/bike paths. This full-size scooter can fit any adult or large youth and is simple and easy to use. It features heavy-duty front drum brakes and a rear EABS (Electronic Absorption Braking System) which recharges the battery when braking, extending range. The handlebars feature all the controls you expect out of a scooter, including front and rear brake levers, throttle, turn signals, horn, cruise control, high/low-beam headlights as well as large analog gauges and displays. And new for 2013, a digital LCD heads-up display tells you all the vitals you need to know when cruising around, including speed, batterly level, motor output, odometer and more. The front wheel features a six-spoke alloy wheel with a semi-gloss black finish. .\u00a0\u00a0}",
