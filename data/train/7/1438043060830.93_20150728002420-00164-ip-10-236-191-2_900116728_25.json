            "There are constant Public Safety patrols, and the people are very nice. There has not been any issues while I have been enrolled here, and it is impossible for outsiders to enter any of the dorms without an Arcadia ID.",
            "While it's on the expensive side, it's worth it for the castle on campus and the wonderful study abroad program.",
            "The campus is very close to Philly, so if you find yourself bored, you can easily walk to the train station and go into Philly. There are also some events on campus which are worth while, and the town of Glenside is pretty nice, too.",
            "You can't expect the food to be as good as homemade. Sometimes it's not very good, and other times it's passable. Altogether, it's school food. There are new dining options that have made the choices better, though.",
            "The dorms are nice, roomy, carpeted, and include a nicely-sized closet, bed, desk, and dresser. The dorm life altogether is very nice and a good experience to have. It helps you learn how to live on your own, while giving you companionship at the same time. The RA's are all very friendly, as well.",
            "The classes are not too challenging, depending on your major, but they do challenge you enough to enjoy them and learn new things.",
            "Be prepared to come to college and let yourself go - into another country! The first opportunity offered is First Year Study Abroad Experience. If that seems too intense, there is Spring Preview, which is a great experience with a week in a different country. There is so much to learn at this school and so many great opportunities.",
            "Arcadia University really gives many opportunities to its students, and the option to go abroad is something that really gives it a strong basis. The campus is beautiful, and there is such a wide variety of diverse people there that you can meet some really extraordinary people while you are surrounded by a castle and other great scenery. The teachers and staff are all very kind and helpful, and the small size of students allows a strong teacher-student relationship."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{310700=Arcadia University is old. First year housing is packed because of the increase of class sizes. The bathrooms could definitely use some updating but they are currently installing elevators in the first year dorms for the 2015-16 academic year. The rooms are a decent size. I was in an overbooked triple my first year which means I was living with two other people in a room made for two. My roommates and I were able to all have our own spaces and get along well. The rooms come with a bed, closet, dresser, and desk for each student. Currently Kistler hall is the only resident hall with air conditioning but they are adding them to the other halls every summer. Air conditioners may be supplied if there is a medical condition. Upperclassmen dorms are much nicer., 105190=The food here is okay. There are three dining options on campus: The Dining Hall, The Chat, and the Easton Cafe. The Dining Hall is all-you-can-eat, which is nice, as well as twenty four hour access to breakfast (bagels, waffles, and cereal, with a gluten-free and lactose-free fridge area). You can also choose a take-out box option; fill the box as much as you want and eat elsewhere. The staff are very friendly. One of the downsides to the Dining Hall, however, are the hours. Currently the Dining Hall is only open from 10:30am to 7:00am if it's not a weekend. So if you want breakfast on a weekday before 10:30, you're forced to go to the Chat. The Chat is not all-you-can eat, and is very rigorous about what you can and cannot have on the university meal plan. Their meal plan selection is very limited. Lastly, the Easton Cafe has snacks, and does not accept the university meal plan at all. The meal plan is weekly based, and does not roll over (you lose swipes you don't use). All first years are required to be on the 14 Meal Plan, which is 14 meals a week which is sometimes too much and sometimes too little. It is especially wasteful when it is too much because you've already paid for those swipes and you can't use them after that week. Arcadia does offer plan-less swipes, where you can buy as may as you think you'll need. You can also charge to your Knight Card (your ID and meal plan swipe card) like a credit card. It has a limit of 1,000 dollars, but like a credit card, you have to pay that balance eventually., 208839=Each October there is a haunted castle tour. And yes we have a castle!, 315509=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students - NOT GOOD FOR PARTY ANIMALS...we participate in life at Arcadia. - Guys and lesbians...because there are mostly women at Arcadia. Otherwise dating can be troublesome. - Undeclared students, because they're great for helping you find your way and have a lot of class option with very helpful teachers. - Students that want to live ON-CAMPUS. I feel like off-campus students miss out a bit on activities and the independent experience. - Not perfect students...nobody is perfect, but if your GPA isn't golden, don't worry, because you'll learn to push yourself here without being completely overwhelmed. Good luck future Arcadians! Overall, this is fantastic school, and we can't wait to see you. Tips for prospective students - Do not bring all that stuff! You don't need it! If you forget anything there's a Walmart in walking distance (I reccomend going there instead of the bookstore or the Chat for food, because they're both expensive). But really, if in doubt, leave it out. - Get involved with your Advisor. Write down questions ahead of time. Do your research. Visit the career development center. Be honest with your Advisor. They can only help you help yourself. - Avoid alcohol and drugs. There's more to life. - Join clubs and volunteer on campus. Go to the events. You will make more friends and have more fun than just sitting in your room! -",
