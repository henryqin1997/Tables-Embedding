            "This data was collected using the LADS Mk II bathymetric Lidar survey system. It is owned by Fugro LADS Corp. and was operated by Fugro LADS, Inc. The system collects bathymetric/topographic data at 1kHz. The system also collects digital imagery at 1Hz. Aircraft position information is collected with Wide Area Differential (WADGPS) through Omistar and is logged with GrafNav. The LADS Mk II system operated on a stabalised platform. Raw data are copied from the LADS Air System (AS) to the LADS Ground System (GS) where post processed GPS is applied as the raw data is processed, producing a 3-D position for each waveform in the dataset. The data was reduced with the use of water level information downloaded from NOAA COOPS website to vertical datum IGLB85 minus a constant 183.2 meters (the LADS ground system allows tidal corrections less than +/- 100 meters due to usual operation in areas closer to mean sea level). 183.2 meters was added back to each sounding as data was exported out of the LADS Ground System to reference it to IDLG85. Data was then shifted by a constant 0.03m to reference the dataset to NAVD88. Fugro Earth Data Inc. then completed the final trasformation to the NAD83 datum. First return and bare earth data sets were exported as LAS 1.2 format files and delivered to Fugro Earth Data Inc. for classification.",
            "Both LAS files were merged, if the same data point existed in both data sets then it was assigned a bare earth classification in the first return data set; If a point existed in the first return dataset and not in the bare earth data set it was assigned a first return classification in the first return LAS data set. To maintain header information the single classified LAS file was then imported into ProjMap for transformation from IGLD85 to GRS80 heights. As ProjMap does not recognize IGLD85 an assumption was made that IGLD85 heights and NAVD88 heights are the same with an error of +/-0.01m. This was determined by transforming a sample of points across the data set with a height value of 183.2m (lake surface) and converting them to NAVD88 with NOAA's VDatum. The average difference across the sample set was < 1cm. GeoCoding in GeoCue was ran to assign the correct header information to the file. The classified LAS 1.2 format file was delivered back to Fugro LADS Inc.",
            "The NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) received files in LAS format. The files contained bathymetric Lidar depth measurements. CSC performed the following processing on the data for data storage purposes and Digital Coast provisioning: 1. The data were converted from projected UTM (NAD83, Zone 15 & 16) coordinates to geographic (NAD83) coordinates 2. The data were converted from NAVD88 heights to ellipsoid heights using Geoid09 3. The LAS header fields were sorted by latitude and updated",
            "The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) received lidar data files via ftp transfer from the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The data are currently being served via NOAA CSC Digital Coast at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. The data can be used to re-populate the system. The data are archived in LAS or LAZ format. The LAS format is an industry standard for LiDAR data developed by the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS); LAZ is a loseless compressed version of LAS developed by Martin Isenburg (http://www.laszip.org/). The data are exclusively in geographic coordinates (either NAD83 or ITRF94). The data are referenced vertically to the ellipsoid (either GRS80 or ITRF94), allowing for the ability to apply the most up to date geoid model when transforming to orthometric heights."
