            "I'm from out-of-state, so money was the biggest deciding factor to choosing where I went to school. However, Auburn has a great scholarship program, so if you made the grades, you will be eligible for lots of merit scholarship.",
            "I've been on campus for nearly a month, and I already love Auburn! Joining a sorority has given me the opportunity to meet so many wonderful girls, and there is almost always a fun party to go to!",
            "I'm currently enrolled in two honors courses here, and I'm learning so much! To those of you who that because Auburn is a state school, it can't offer the same academic rigor as private universities, there are so many opportunities within the honors program to learn at a faster pace."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{378765=Auburn University radiates with some of the best student athletes in the country and the world. This year, twenty eight Auburn students attended the 2012 London Olympic Games. Auburn is also one of the leading schools for college football and there is nothing like a SEC football game. In the small town, most students attend local parties or attend social events provided by the university., 44837=I find one of the key factors in enjoying college is making great friends. Auburn has so many different opportunities and organizations for you to get involved with it makes it really easy to find students with similar likes and dislikes. I really like the layout of the campus, it's not very complicated and the student center is in the middle of campus which makes it easy to meet people for a meal or to study. The nice thing about Auburn is whether you are a hard core partier or a book worm you will fit in and find friends. The weather is really nice (minus July and August) and the college is very pretty and clean. Over all I have had lots of fun at school., 935492=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 792477=Some of the food on campus is a little expensive and sometimes not very good. But, there are also many very good options for campus dining. For example, there is a Chick-Fil-A, many food trucks, and a Starbucks. Students that live on campus must pay $1000 extra on their tuition for food and off-campus students pay $300., 477036=Was accepted by Auburn for Fall 2013 for their Electrical Engineering - Computer option program. We visited their campus and loved the feel of the campus, very beautiful. Really looking forward to studying here for engineering., 710915=Apply for housing early! If you apply before December or so, you'll get to live in your first choice of housing. The Quad has the best location, and the Village has the nicest rooms. But the Hill area has the bigger rooms yet the farthest of walks. I would advise that you apply as soon as you are accepted, it's a $200 deposit and if you consider attending Auburn it's worth the money! In addition to that, I would advise that you apply for scholarships as much as possible. I never realized how much college would cost. Both of my sisters went to private colleges, and I figured that Auburn being a public university wouldn't cost so much. However, it's expensive!! I wish that I had applied for any scholarship available at the time. Even if you think you won't win it, or if the prompt is too difficult, do it anyway! You have nothing to lose., 438610=Auburn has a mandatory dining dollars program where every student must put a certain amount of money into an account that you can only use on campus. Students living off campus have to pay $300 a semester and students living on campus have to pay $1000 a semester. This system makes it so that there is actually a good variety of places to eat, but it's really just an inconvenience if you live off campus and are not around during lunch or dinner time. If you don't use all of your dining dollars after spring semester, they are taken from you., 901781=There are many concerts held on the concourse at Auburn. On Saturdays, in the fall, there are many football games to attend. The home games are always the most exciting , that is ...until AU games end up in a lose. The basketball players always dominant in the winter, especially the girls team. The volleyball players remain victorious at the beginning of the year. There are many chorus concerts sprinkled throughout the year. The most fun is the winter acapella production in December. I think I personally find that wonderful since I grew up in chorus groups. There is a recreational building for all who want to exercise. Take it from me when I say, even the laziest person in the world will find something to do in there. There are the typical courts, exercise machines. but there is a swimming pool, an astounding rock-climbing wall, ping-pong tables, the list goes on and on. Of course, I find the most fun to be sitting in my dorm room on Saturday morning doing nothing but playing my guitar and once I get tired of that, I watch many youtube videos until I remember I must do my chemistry homework and read the next four chapters to prepare myself for next week., 884359=My favorite thing to do at Auburn is go to the football games. The student section is so much fun and the football team is really good. The whole university and town of Auburn is very into football, so if you do not like it, your Saturdays will be a little lonely here. I also love going to basketball games and gymnastics meets. Also, Auburn's University Program Council has fun concerts and events that happen all year. In August, they got Ben Rector and Switchfoot to come for a free concert! Thanks to them and all of the campus organizations, there is always something to do., 389105=For fun there is the student activity center, which there is a new one being built that is suppose to be done Spring 2013, containing elevated track, multiple courts, pools, and much more., 300501=Auburn has a great variety of food choices, from Mexican to Chinese to Chick-Fil-A. I lived in the oldest dorms on campus, where the dining hall does not have very many choices. However, anywhere on campus is a 10-15 minute walk away, so getting food was not a problem. Also, the required dining plan for on-campus students is $1000 per semester. It is a lot of money to spend, but it comes in handy., 100085=Make sure to apply before December 1st to meet the scholarship deadline!, 219024=of course there is the tradition of rolling toomer's trees and getting toomer's lemonade, the best lemonade in the world. and then before every home football game seeing the eagle fly out while thousands of people are shouting the same war eagle. and one of my favorite things to hear on campus is the fight song coming from samford hall every day at 12:00., 760065=It is never a dull moment with your roommate, suite mate, or new best friends across the hall. Auburn's dorms are very accommodating and they just opened brand new dorms this past August., 784307=A bus will run after 5:00 pm to 6:00 am to transport students on campus when called. Numerous safety areas to call for help located throughout campus., 132012=Although Auburn is a lot of fun due to all of our sororrities/fraternities and outstanding athletics, AU is definitely not an easy school. In 2011, Auburn University was listed as one of the hardest universities to receive an A. Luckily, we have a wonderful tutoring sessions and tutors called StudyPartners which are shown to increase a student's test scores by a letter grade., 23714=Visit campus in the fall or spring to really get the feel of what Auburn is like. You can even sit in on classes if you ask someone you know or even the Student Recruiters (tour guides). If you're coming from out of state, Greek life may be the perfect way to meet people (that's a main reason why I did it). If it's not right for you, no worries there are also many other ways to meet people. These are some tips specifically if you are going to Auburn: 1) Get your lunch right before classes get out so you don't have to wait in long lines (espceially at Salsaritas or ABP) 2) If you get season football tickets, that's great! If not, a majority of your fellow freshman friends will also have half season so you can still tailgate or watch it on TV 3) It is a 10 minute walk from Terrell to Haley 4) If you are required to move your car during football season, don't wait till Friday. There are usually avaliable spots in RO on Wednesday or Thursday. 5) Don't spend all your meal plan in the first two months. 6) Every drink and food item in the stadium is $4 so bring money to the games, and your meal plan won't cover it 7) Studying for tests in high school is not like studying in college. If you feel that you need tutoring early on, go for it! 8) Be careful where you park and know the parking rules. You cannot park in RH, RW, or RQ on weekends. 9) Get involved! :) There are over 300 organizations on campus! Or start your own! 10) Sororities have their chapters on Tuesday and Wednesay night so Village Dining is very crowded for dinner! 11) If you are eating on campus dinner on Friday or Saturday night, eat early because places close early! 12) If you are living in the dorms, bring your laundry home to wash if you can, the machines are expensive 13) Make a friend in each of your classes, you may not end up best friends but you can help each other out 14) If you can do it, take a foreign language! It is very fun! :) 15) Get to football games when the gates open for students, it is easier to find a seat (especially for a large group!) 16) Don't wait till the night before to write a paper 17) Stay off of Facebook and any other social networking sites during finals week, it will help! 18) Decorate your room for Christmas :) 19) Finding an electrical outlet in the library during a busy night is very hard! And so is a parking spot, take the security shuttle if you have to 20) The security shuttle is very helpful but on busy nights, budget 30 minutes of time for waiting and driving. 21) Wear sunscreen and sunglasses to the games, and night games get cold starting late September so bring a sweater! 22) Spending all day in the library? Take your favorite hoodie and blanket, you'll be more comfortable! And remember to take the occasional break! 23) Have a morning test and want to study? Go to ABP for an hour, it's not too loud and you can get breakfast too! 24) Have RO and live in the Hill? You can rent a parking spot at the Auburn Alumni Center (next to FIJI) each semester War Eagle!, 428143=The greatest tradition most people have heard about Auburn is the rolling of Toomer's Corner. Yes indeed this is very true. Unfortunately though due to the nice gentleman who decided it was time for the trees to be no more (sarcasm of course), the trees have been closed off as they are expected to die by the end of this year (2012-2013). But you better believe that won't get us down nor is that our only tradition. If you go to football games (can you tell I love football?) you'll witness a few traditions there as well, most notably the eagle circling the stadium and landing midfield for a big WAR EAGLE from the crowd! Overall tons of fun to be had, and it's all right here at Auburn University!, 471085=Auburn has some of the riches traditions in the SEC and the nation. Although rolling Toomer's Oaks may be dwindling after the 2010 poisoning, Hey Day, Tiger Walk, the eagle flying before games, the fight song everyday at noon, Aubie winning mascot competitions, and a history of academic excellence makes Auburn one of the riches places for traditions around}",

I have not met one person who was unhappy to be in Auburn, AL. It is a great place and it will grow on you very fast. Auburn is a great home for anyone looking to further their education and have a blast while doing it. War Eagle! Tips for prospective students You should definitely look around. Never just choose one college and not have backups. However, if you are looking towards Auburn, definitely visit the campus. Take a tour. The town is wonderful and any pictures don't even do it justice. Make sure you apply as early as possible because there are a lot of eager people wanting to get in. Bang for the buck I am paying out of state tuition. So from my angle",
