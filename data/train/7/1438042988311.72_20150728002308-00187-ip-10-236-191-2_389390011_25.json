Earlier in the session, Lucas Liss had led the way for Germany by winning the men\u2019s omnium ahead of Glenn O\u2019Shea (Australia) and Unai Elorriaga Zubiaur (Spain). Meanwhile, Lasse Norman Hansen (Denmark) \u2013 who won the omnium at the London 2012 Olympics \u2013 was focused on the individual pursuit in Glasgow, and he took gold ahead of Ireland\u2019s Martyn Irvine. In the women\u2019s sprint, Kristina Vogel (Germany) emerged victorious by coolly dispatching of Jessica Varnish (Great Britain) in the final, winning 2-0. On each occasion, Vogel bided her time and nipped around Varnish on the crown of the final bend to take the decision. Varnish had defeated her British teammate Rebecca James to make the final, and James duly won the bronze medal race. In the men\u2019s keirin, Olympic champion Jason Kenny (Great Britain) was the star attraction, but a crash in the final meant that he could only take fourth place, while Stefan Boetticher (Germany) took the gold medal ahead of Australia\u2019s Peter Lewis. Day two of the UCI Track World Cup in Glasgow saw success for Germany in three separate disciplines while the British challenge was thwarted before an expectant public in Glasgow.",
