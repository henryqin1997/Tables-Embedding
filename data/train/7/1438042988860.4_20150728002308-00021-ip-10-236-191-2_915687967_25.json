            "Great for people who want nice weather 24/7, live near urban/suburban life, for students majoring in business, performing arts, film/digital art, psychology, education, and athletic training, for those who live in california currently, have a great interest in community service and campus involvement",
            "Check out study abroad programs early! They are costly and the application process takes up to a year. Start looking at scholarships and grants and apply for FAFSA!!! Look into on-campus jobs and explore the area. Chapman is located near so many awesome spots like the beaches, Disneyland, sport arenas, and the Circle. Best investment: An annual Disneyland pass :)",
            "Chapman is costly, but for your buck, you get nice quality and often times lots of free stuff! I volunteered for our Chapman Day of Service and each student got a free jacket (worth about $90) and were exclusively sold to Chapman students who participated in the event! But be prepared when you do look at the price tag however, because it is expensive when you add up your total",
            "I have met so many people from all over the country and I am getting involved on and off campus thanks to volunteer opportunities and events/clubs on campus. Not to mention, weather is pretty good out here most of the time. And there is plenty of food options thanks to being next door to the historic Orange Circle",
            "College is more than just textbooks and all-nighters before finals. At Chapman, I have gotten hands-on experience in some of my classes and I like the fact that my professors use real life examples to correlate what I am learning in the classroom. You also have access to resources that can help clarify questions and expand your research when you study. I have never been taught by a TA; all of the faculty members want to be with their students and they are flexible with helping you succeed with office hours and free tutoring."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{452024=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 80132=The school is in a great location and surrounded by so many things to do. Chapman is so close to the beach and not a far drive from la or the surrounding areas. Disneyland is within ten minutes, which makes it easy to hop in the car and take a trip to Disneyland for a few hours to reduce stress and have a great time with your friends. The weather is phenomenally! I would never have expected to be outside tanning in December while studying for finals. Chapman is all I could have asked for and more., 175159=As mentioned, Interterm in January is essentially free, as in no additional cost to live and eat on campus and take up to 3 additional credit credits. Also, Chapman will waive tuition on a study-abroad program once during your time there. I just got back from a month in Perugia, Italy, didn't have to pay the $1960 tuition, and Dodge College also subsidized a $1700 portion of the travel expenses!, 39720=If you like to learning directly from the experts is what you want then you will love Chapman. Chapman's classes are taught by world renowned professors including Nobel Prize winner Dr. Vernon L. Smith, winner of the Wolff Prize Yakir Aharonov and the famous political scientist Dr. Lori Cox Hans who taught my freshman class. Be the envy of your friends by learning from the best., 142032=For me, I'm only taking about $2000 out in loans to pay for tuition, while the rest is covered in financial aid and there is nothing more I could ask for. For a $60 student activities fee, so many events and clubs are available for students to participate in., 159448=The food is decently tasty, but not always terribly healthy. I suspect this has changed since I graduated in May of 2010., 34002=Chapman is costly, but hunt for scholarships (especially through Cappex!) and find as much financial aid as you can. For the cost though, you do get a quality education and experiences such as lectures with famous scholars, resources that are free, and you have a classroom ratio of 20:1. You also can get involved with so much throughout the year that will really help you succeed at Chapman such as clubs, sororities, fraternities, academic involvement, study abroad and so much more!, 178470=Chapman's Dodge College, its training and equipment rivals USC, UCLA and just about any other film school. The small class size is a major plus, as I want my professors to know me by name. Being able to take a course for free during Interterm in January is also great.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Yes, it's a private school so it's expensive. But again, Chapman gives away so much in scholarships. Also, as a student you will be well pampered. As you walk through campus you will be surrounded by beautiful architecture, landscape, fountains, and marble. As you sit through lecture, you will notice we have some of the most interesting and intellectual professors. As you wonder about your future, you will have access to almost an unlimited supply of resources concerning internships and job opportunities. How much you get out of your tuition depends on how much involvement you initiate yourself. What to do for fun You are in ORANGE COUNTY. There is an infinite amount of things to do for fun. Being a kid in Disneyland, napping at Newport Beach, clubbing in West Hollywood, partying in Los Angeles, partying at school, partying at USC/UCLA, or the best thing to do in college--NAP WHENEVER YOU WANT. Food and Dining Our dining hall has an Asian station (sushi everyday!), European station, American station, Panini/Salad bar, desert station, you name it. There is only one dining hall, but this is sufficient given the size of the school. There are also places on campus that are included in the meal plan (Jamba Juice, Einstein Bagels, WOW wings, library cafe, another cafe in the",
