Many activities to do. I'll recommend this school to anyone who wants to have a future!!! Tips for prospective students Well you would have probably heard a lot of things about Montclair( many terrible things) but I want to tell you otherwise MSU is one of the greatest public schools in the state and country at large. It is very affordable, environment is very conducive, students are active friendly and intelligent, staff are resourceful and helpful even though there maybe some exceptions, food is OK, plenty activities to do a lot of clubs and organizations, financial aid and scholarships are available, on campus jobs are available and they even bend it around your schedule, there is also a train station on campus that takes you to NY. People MSU is really a great school I believe you should come and see for yourself. Just",
