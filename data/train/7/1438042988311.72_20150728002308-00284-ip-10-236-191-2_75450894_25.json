Twenty miles of the road on the southern end, from Oakland to Granada, were completed on the 31 of July, and the first through train left this city on the following day. The future prospects of the road are certainly of the most flattering character. Passing through one of the richest Cotton-growing regions of the South, and forming, as it does, an important part of the great Northern and Southern line of travel, its future operations can scarcely be otherwise than profitable to the public and remunerative to stockholders and others interested. The road is 99 miles in length, and is, for the most part, well built. There are thirteen \"Howe Truss\" bridges, and seven wrought iron, in spans of 25 and 30 feet, resting on solid and substantial approaches. The pressure of the times has prevented the erection of permanent depot buildings and machine shops at Memphis, which was wisely deferred until the track should be completed; yet this company does all its own repairs in temporary shops, attached to which is a car manufactory, which is turning out all the cars required by the road--some of them the finest to be found in the country. The business of the road during the past year, circumstances considered, has been excellent, the amount of freight shipped from this city especially showing a marked increase. The earnings of the road, in its various departments, will be seen from the following:, 196348=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The crop of the past year (1860-'61) was materially affected by the severe drouth experienced in many sections of the hay producing country during the latter part of the season, and the yield proved to be light--indeed, far below the average of former years. Under these circumstances, and with no prospect of a decreased consumption, it was confidently anticipated that p ices would rule high; and during the fall months there was a very marked increase in the speculative demand, and some of the heaviest transactions in the article on record transpired in various portions of the West. The past winter, however, proving to be quite mild and open, affording excellent pasturage for stock throughout the entire Southern country, there was a very considerate decrease in the demand and consumption, and, so far from the sanguine expectations of speculators as to high prices being realized, the article ruled at uniformly lower figures than for several previous years. A glance at the table of prices hereto appended, will show that the average price from September 1st to the latter part of April, when apprehensions of a blockade upon supplies began to be entertained, was a fraction under $24 per tun, and even when, a few weeks later, it was known with certainty that no further shipments would be made to this point, so well was our market supplied, that only a slight advance took place. It will also be seen that there were only slight fluctuations in the market during the first five months of the year, and those occasioned entirely by the movement of supply and demand, but that, during February, March and a portion of April, prices fell to $17 @ $18 for prime Timothy--the lowest point of the season. This result was produced by large receipts and the accumulation of unwieldy stocks, in view of which, holders modified their views, in order that the market might experience at least temporary relief. In anticipation of an early restriction of supplies from the upper country, a brisk demand sprung up during the last week in April, and prices advanced rapidly, until, on the 30th, sales were made at $28 @ $30 per tun for prime, and at $22 @ $24 for common. Stocks being ample, and the country demand having been pretty generally supplied during the season of low prices, the market experienced little or no change during the two following months, but ruled steady at $26 @ $30 for prime, from levee and store. The liberal demands subsequently expressed by army contractors and others, enhanced the price, early in June, to $35 per ton for prime, which figures have continued to rule, with but slight variations, up to the present time. The prospect for fall and winter supplies, with a continuance of the present blockade, are not of the most flattering character, and it behooves farmers and consumers generally to exercise the utmost economy in the use of the article., 22953=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The attention of the Chamber was early in March directed To alleged discriminations against the trade of Memphis, practiced by the managers of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad. It was charged that an unfair policy was Pursued, tending to injure the trade of this city, and in Favor of Mobile, through a system of tariff charges which Were much higher on the northern end of the road, then Terminating in Corinth, than on the southern or Mobile End. A committee was appointed to inquire into the matter, And after a lengthy, patient, and impartial investigation, reported that the charges were in great part sustained. The subsequent action of the officers of the road has, we are pleased to State, been far less objectionable to Memphis people and Memphis interests., 126970=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The total receipts of Cotton at this point during the past year were 369,633 bales, against 398, 791 bales in 1859-60--a decrease this year of 29,159 bales. The shipments during the same period embraced 369,858 bales, against 391,918 bales in 1859-60--decrease this year 22,061 bales., 175839=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the quantity of flour manufactured in the city during the past year, we find it to have been comparatively limited--say 50,000 barrels--fully 40 000 barrels of which have been made from the new crop, and within the past three months. The capicity of the various mills of the city is about 600 barrels per day, consuming 3,000 bushels of wheat, and since the 1st of July these establishments have all been taxed to the utmost to supply the home demand. The quality of the flour made in this city is unsurpassed, and stands A.1 in New Orleans and all the coast markets--commanding, in fact a decided premium over any of the fancy brands made in the Northern States. Hence, our mills are seldom at a loss for purchasers, especially for all choice brands, and at full and remunerative prices. The receipts of the year have been the largest ever known in this market, and this, too, in the face of a blockade from about the middle of the season up to the present time, which has prevented immense quantities from reaching the city. The supply, too, has always been ample, and large or small orders of any description have been readily filled., 21665=suspension of specie payment by the banks of Tennessee, in common with those of nearly every other commercial city and State in the country. The question came before the Chamber at its November meeting, a series of resolutions to the proper effect were proposed and adopted, and on the following day the banks of the city acquiesced in the movement, and were soon followed by those of the entire State. The wisdom of this policy has since been manifest to the satisfaction of all classes., 4138=Source Description: (title page) First Annual Statement of the Trade and Commerce of Memphis, for the Year ending August 31, 1861. Reported to the Memphis Chamber of Commerce by Jno. S. Toof, Secretary. Toof, Jno. S. (John S.). 37 p. Memphis O'Neill & Parrish, Printers, 13 Madison Street. 1861. Call number 2147.8 Conf (Rare Book Collection, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill), 58714=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From the census returns of 1860, taken under the auspices of the United States Government, we collate the annexed table, showing the amount of capital at that time invested in manufacturing enterprises within the city limits, the value of raw material annually consumed and the moneyed value of productions:, 195022=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Early in June, under the influence of an active local and export demand, prices for all descriptions of meat advanced, and there was great firmness at 12 @ 12 1/2c for Shoulders; Ribbed Sides 16 @ 16 1/2c; Clear Sides 17 @ 17 1/2c, Hams 16 @ 17 1/2c ; Mess Pork $26 @ 27; and Lard 12 @ 15c, which figures have ruled, with slight and immaterial fluctuations, up to the present time. The wisdom and patriotism of several of our leading merchants and bankers--who, in order to guard against scarcity and the high prices to consumers which would have necessarily followed, a short time previous to the enforcement of the blockade, contributed funds sufficient to purchase $100,000 worth of provisions and ship the same to this city-- prevented any unusual advance in prices, and at the same time gave assurance that in addition to the large stocks in the hands of private dealers, supplies would be ample for all ordinary demands. The exigency, to meet which the purchase was made, failing to arise by the middle of July, the entire stock consisting of 3,000 barrels Pork and about 300 cks of Bacon, was disposed of by auction, at the Merchants' Exchange, and the profits arising from the sale devoted to charitable purposes., 170613=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The market for the current year opened with light stocks and a limited inquiry, the ruling figures being 38 @ 40c., from levee. Receipts improved towards the close of September, but the demand fully keeping pace with supplies, prices gradually stiffened until the middle of October,0 when round lots commanded 45 @ 50c. A week later, and stocks had accumulated to such an extent that prices gave way 2 1/2 @ 5c., at which the market continued steady until the last week in November, when, with large stocks and a considerable falling off in the demand, owing to restrictions upon railroad shipments to the interior, figures were reduced to 33 @ 35c. The market experienced only slight fluctuations from this time until the middle of January--stocks in the meantime being ample, with a moderate demand--when a lively inquiry springing up from he local trade and for seed purposes, rates advanced to 40 @ 50c. for white and black. Under the influence of this inquiry, the market was somewhat exited during the five or six following weeks, with little or no change in prices until the middle of March, when heavy stocks depressed the market, and holders offered freely at 33 @ 35c. A moderate business was transacted be ween this date and the latter part of April--prices varying but little-- when the \"blockade\" had the effect to stimulate the local demand and force prices upward 2 1/2 @ c. Stocks at this period having become reduced to some3,000 bags, and all in the hands of two or three parties, the market continued to advance, and by the close of May was firm at 55 @ 60c per bushel. During the months of June, July and August, the demand has been comparatively limited, and prices have ruled steady at 60 @ 62 1/2c. per bushel from store. The yield of the present crop is, perhaps, the largest ever produced in this section, and of the best quality., 146338=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From the Annual statement of Messrs. II. T. Lonsdale, Nathan & Co., of New Orleans, we learn that the total receipts of Coffee at that port from Rio, during the year ending with 1st of July, embraced 284, 956 bags, against 298,335 bags in 1859-60, and 426,476 bags in 1858-59. The total exports of Coffee from Rio to all parts of America, for the year ending 31st May, are stated at 1,084,400 bags, 737,900 bags of which have entered at Atlantic, and 346,500 bags through Gulf ports. These figures show an increase as compared with last year of 138,987 bags, and as compared with 1858-59, of 307,535 bags. The quantity sold in New Orleans for consumption, during the past year, was 293,941 bags, leaving a stock on hand in that city, on the 1st of July, of only 6,103 bags. The total stock in the country, at that date, was estimated at 172,000 bags, of which 136,000 bags were held in New York; 26,000 in Baltimore, and 4,000 in Boston. The stock on hand at the above date, last year, was 43,000 bags, showing an increase this year of 129,000 bags., 21457=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The financial troubles which began to oppress the country early in November, seemed imperatively to require a, 142860=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The results of the past season warrant all the conclusions contained in the foregoing extract. Owing to the great and general drought of the spring and summer of 1860, the crop grown was considerably short of the preceding, particularly in that portion of country trading at our market. The crop was probably nearly a half less than, 187263=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The course of the market for these articles, during the last twelve months, will be briefly reviewed under one heading. The commencement of the season, in September last, found very light stocks on the market, with a good demand not only from the local trade but from remote regions which had previously looked elsewhere for supplies, but which having been brought into close connection with Memphis through the medium of our various railways, were beginning to test for themselves the superior advantages of our market. Mess Pork opened at $22 per barrel, Lard at 15c; Shoulders at 11 1/4 @ 11 1/2c; Clear Sides at 13 3/4 @ 14c, and Hams at 14 @ 15c. Early in September the receipts from the upper country were more liberal and the supply was largely in excess of the demand. This state of affairs continued until about the, 131326=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In reference to this article, we invite attention to the following extract from our annual statement of Sept. 1st, 1860, furnishing a history of the introduction of this article of commerce into our market, and the progress made in that particular branch of trade up to the date above specified:, 73735=stiffening. As the mouth progressed, the disastrous effects of the drouth were more apparent, find in addition to this, the boll-worm and fly were beginning to seriously affect the plant along the bottom lands of Mississippi and Arkansas. The receipts of the month were liberal, comprising 24,210 bales, against 15,677 in 1859. . . . . During the early part of October, operations were restricted by the stringent state of the money market, and the very great difficulty experienced in negotiating exchange, and prices ruled steady and unchanged. About the 20th, however, with a succession of favorable advices to hand from all the leading foreign and domestic markets, together with an easier tone in the money market, where sales of exchange, drawn against shipments, were more readily effected, now life and animation was infused into the trade, and the month closed with a buoyant market at an advance of 1/4 @ 1/2c. on all grades,--the sales of the closing week embracing fully 21,000 bales. Month's receipts, 76,755 bales, against 71,042 bales in 1859. . . . . The brisk speculative and manufacturing demand, observable at the close of October, continued during the first few days of November, the sales on the 2d embracing nearly 5000 bales, but as the day of the Presidential election approached, political excitement ran high, and commercial affairs were for the moment neglected. A decline of 1/4 @ 1/2c.was thus occasioned, from which the market failed to rally until the middle of February, and having, in the meantime, sank to 8c. for Middling. The receipts of November summed up 73,776 bales against 99,653 bales for the preceding year. The demand during the month was chiefly manufacturing--speculators, in view of the unsatisfactory condition of political affairs, very generally abstaining from operations. The sales were consequently limited to 21,000 bales. . . . . During the early part of the month of December, political affairs grew daily more complicated and embarrassing to financial matters and the regular course of exchange, and the Cotton market was very much depressed, Middling on the 7th being dull at 8c.--the lowest point of the season. Subsequently, how ever, political affairs began to wear a more cheerful aspect, the news from Europe became more encouraging, financial matters experienced some improvement, and by the 24th the market had returned to its wonted activity, and prices improved fully 2 1/4c. per lb. This improvement was maintained until the close of the month, when we quoted Middling at 10 @ 10 1/4c. Receipts fell off to 44,879 bales, against 55,563 in December 1859. . . . . A continuance. of favorable Liverpool advices, added to growing ease in financial circles, and more confidence among speculators as to the future stability of prices, early in January resulted in a further advance, placing quotations at the highest point of the season--the competition in the market, in the meantime, having been lively, and embracing buyers not only for Northern and Southern, but for di rect Liverpool and Manchester account. The aggregate business of the month was the largest of the season, embracing 76,000 bales, the sales on the three closing days summing up 16,890 bales. Receipts also the heaviest of the season--87,753 bales, against 42,586 in January '59. . . . . . During February a good degree of animation prevailed in the market, and with a good attendance of Northern, European, and Southern buyers, the demand was active, and prices, while experiencing no change, ruled steady throughout, and closed firm. Month's receipts 37,755 bales; in 1859, 64,163 bales. . . . . March opened with a lively competition among buyers, caused by the favorable tenor of European advices, evincing, as they did, that our trans-Atlantic customers were becoming seriously alarmed as to future supplies; by the threatenng attitude of American affairs, and were disposed to purchase freely and at full prices. Hence Middlings, which on the 1st were held at 10 1/4 @ 10 1/2c., steadily advanced to 11c., then to 11 1/2c. and finally, on the 26th of the month to 12c. per lb., at which there was much firmness and great activity. Buyers for Northern manufacturing account also evinced more disposition to operate, and what with these and the free purchases of New Orleans and Liverpool parties, the stock on sale was rapidly reduced from 40,060 bales, on the 1st, to less than 5000 on the 31st, the receipts in the meantime having also comprised 14,772 bales. . . . . The upward tendency in prices, above referred to, continued until the close of the first week in April, by which time a further improvement of 1/2c.was established, placing Middling at the extraordinary figure of 12 1/2c. At this time stocks had become so reduced, and the prospect for future receipts so unfavorable, that the majority of buyers withdrew from the market, and the Cotton season, proper, virtually closed. A glance at the annexed schedule of prices will show the slight changes in prices that may have occurred from that date to the present, during the greater part of which time operations have been mostly confined to orders from interior Southern manufacturers--prices meanwhile being regulated solely by the relative necessities of buyers and sellers., 22164=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the January meeting the passage of a \"Stay Law\" By the Legislature then in session, was made known. Resolutions depreciating the passage of such an act as unwise, Impolitic and unnecessary, were adopted, and as the Law was deemed retrospective in its operation and violative Existing contracts, our immediate representatives Were requested to use their best endeavors to secure its repeal. An odious measure, adopted by the same Legislature, Repealing a law of fifty years' standing, requiring Debts, to give security and pay 12 per cent. interest, was Condemned as oppressive and unjust to the debtor class. The \"Stay Law\" was not repealed, but was soon after Declared unconstitutional by the State Courts., 49176=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MEMPHIS AND OHIO RAILROAD.--This road forms an important link in the chain of railroads connecting Louisville, Memphis, and New Orleans, extending from Memphis to Paris, Tennessee, a distance of 130 miles. The road was completed 57 miles to Brownsville, in 1855; to Humboldt, 82 miles, in April, 1859, and to Paris, the northern terminus, May 11, 1860. In consequence of the Clarksville road not having been completed, direct communication was not made with Louisville until April 15, 1861, on which day the first through train left Memphis, and arrived in Louisville in twenty hours. The time has since been reduced to eighteen hours, and on the completion of the Tennessee river bridge, we are assured it will be still further reduced. The distance from Memphis to Louisville is--Memphis and Ohio Road, 130 miles; Memphis, Clarksville and Louisville Road, 83 miles, and Louisville and Nashville Road, 167 miles--total 380 miles. The short time that has elapsed since the opening of this route, and the partial prostration of trade in consequence of the war, precludes the formation of a correct estimate of the immense business that will be transacted by this road when peace shall again be restored. For the present we can only refer to the movements of freight over the road, as indicated by the statements elsewhere contained in this report. Each year's earnings of the road have evinced a decided increase over the preceding year. In 1860 the receipts exhibited an increase over 1859 of 67 per cent; and in 1861 over 1860 of 20 per cent., of which $59,061 was from passengers, $29,831 from freights, and $2,691 from mails--total increase $91,585. The total receipts of the past year embraced $362,595 33; operating expenses same time, $190,754 78; leaving as nett earnings, $171,840 55. The road, as we are informed, has cost about $3,300,000, including buildings and equipments. The financial condition of the road may be briefly stated: Tennessee bonds, maturing in 1895, '96, '97, '98, and '99, $1,493,000; Company 6 per cent. bonds, due in 1866, $97,000; Company income bonds, 10 per cent. due in 1870, $432,000--total funded debt, $2,022,00); floating debt, $278,000--total liabilities, $2,300,000. It will thus be seen that the cost of building and equipping the road exceeds the total liabilities of the Company by $1 000,000. Annexed we give a, 205790=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The price of rope, at the opening of the season, as above, ranged from 8 1/2 to 9c for machine, and 8 @ 8 1/2c for hand spun. Of the machine rope, there are various brands which receive attention in this market, principal among which are \"Richardson's Green Leaf,\" \"Randall's Horse,\" \"Hunt's\" and \"Allen & Co 's\", of Kentucky, and \"Eagle,\" \"Todd,\" \"Empire,\" and various other mills, of Missouri. The above prices were maintained with but slight and immaterial fluctuation, until ab ut the 1st of November, when it was apparent that holders would be compelled to make concessions in both bagging and rope, on account of a heavy decline in India bagging and the very free use being made of iron ties. The decline thus occasioned may be quoted at 1/2 @ 1c per yard and pound, followed by a dull and inactive market. There was very little change in the market, save a pretty free enquiry for rope during November and December, until about the beginning of the current year, from which time until the middle of May, both of these articles ruled very dull, in consequence of the financial revulsion attending the disordered state or political affairs[.] Indeed, such was the depression, that during the early part of the month machine rope could be had here at 6 1/2 @ 7c, power-loom bagging at 14 @ 15c and hand-loom ditto at 13 @ 14c. Stocks, however, had in the meantime become very much reduced. About the middle of May, when our merchants were made aware that Lincoln & Co. had effectually blockaded the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, thereby cutting off supplies of these articles from St. Louis, whence a great portion of the stock used here is received, the market experienced considerable advance, and rope, which could have been bought in May for 6 1/2c, now readily commands 9 1/2c, in large lots, and bagging, which was offered in May at 14c, had advanced to 18c. For some six weeks after the enforcement of the river blockade, we were compelled to rely upon the Louisville market, and the receipts by this source were pretty free until the 24th of June, when both these articles were declared contraband, and further supplies stopped by order of the Northern Government., 69668=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The market for the past year opened on the 1st of September with a stock on hand of 1,709 bales, against 1,184 bales at the same date in 1859--60, and 2,671 bales in 1858--59. The receipt of new crop, to that date, comprised 275 bales, against 56 bales in 1859-60, and 25 bales in 1858-59. The first bale of the crop, now under review, reached the city on the 2d of August, against the 17th of August in 1859, and the 24th of August in the preceding year. It was from Bolivar county, Miss., classed Good Middling, and sold immediately on arrival at 12 1/2c. per lb. The first bale from Arkansas was received on the 8th of August--from Crittenden county--and the first from Tennessee--Fayette county--on the l0th following., 175474=season. The general failure of the wheat crop of the Southern country for the year 1859--'60, and the consequent falling off in home production, created an unusual demand for flour, and as the facilities afforded purchasers in this market were unsurpassed in the South or West, our trade has been much heavier and more widely extended than ever before., 147451=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The local market for Coffee opened on the 1st of last September at 15 1-2 @ 16c. for Fair to Good Fair, and 16 1-2 @ 17c. for Prime to Choice, with light stocks, and an active demand from the local trade and for shipment to the interior. Prices experienced a gradual decline from this date, owing to liberal receipts and stocks, and on the 1st of November 141-2 @ 15 1-2c. were the ruling figures for Fair to Choice. The financial troubles of this period continued to depress the market, and by the close of December prices had further declined to 131-2 @ 14 1-2, with very little doing. There was no further change in prices until about the middle of March, when Fair went down to 12 3/4 @ l3c., and Prime to Choice l3 3/4 @ l4 1/4c.--the lowest point of the entire season. The political difficulties which began to develop themselves at this period, embracing the threatened blockade of Southern ports, involving a cutting off of supplies, together with the limited stocks known to be in New Orleans, caused more firmness on the part of holders, and prices commenced to advance. This upward movement continued to progress steadily, and by the 1st of July, Fair to fully Fair was selling at 20 c., and Prime to Choice at 22c., a very heavy business having in the meantime been transacted, and our market patronized by dealers from far distant sections of the country, who had never before thought of looking to Memphis for supplies. The market continued active up to the date of closing this report, with a further advance in prices equal to 10 @ 15 cents per pound, and with light stocks and great firmness on the part of holders, we now quote Fair to fully Fair 34 @ 35c., and Prime to Choice 40c. The receipts of the season, at this point, embrace 30,458 bags., 156612=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the first half of January, the market was quiet, but before the close of the third week, under the influence of political causes, a lively demand sprang up, and prices soon rallied to the extent of 2 @ 3c per bushel, which was maintained until the close--stocks in the meantime having been materially reduced, while the receipts had fallen to 17,833 bags. This spur in the market, added to a fine stage of water in all the upper rivers, induced heavy shipments to this point during the first two weeks of February, by which time the advance last referred to had been lost, the demand momentarily checked, and the market pretty well glutted. Affairs moved along in this wise until the close of the month, when, with a moderate inquiry and ample stocks, we quoted yellow and mixed 56c. and white 58c. March opened with a good demand, but, with serious impediments to transportation eastward by railroad, owing to an immense press of through freight upon the Memphis and Charleston and Mobile and Ohio roads, which in great measure prevented the usual local accommodations. The receipts, too, opened briskly, and, as the sequel proved, were by far the largest of any similar period of the season; hence it was that immense stocks soon accumulated, and prices f ll to 52 1/2 @ 55c., and finally, on the 29th, to 50 @ 52 1/2c. per bushel--the deliveries of the month having reached the large amount of 99,611 bags., 55398=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MEMPHIS AND LITTLE ROCK RAILROAD.--The prospects of this Road are of a very flattering and gratifying character. Several months since the affairs of the Company passed into the hands of a new administration, under whose auspices the work of completion is being prosecuted with vigor. From official sources we learn that track-laying is progressing on both ends, that the grading is completed from Duvall's Bluff, on White river, to Little Rock, and some 18 miles of track laid down since April last, with the prospect of completion by the 1st November. Prior to this date it is expected that the bridge crossing the St. Francis will be completed, when we shall be in direct and uninterrupted communication with Little Rock. The heaviest portion of the grading of the intervening space of forty-five miles between Madison and Duvall's Bluff, has been performed; the iron for the entire road purchased, and sufficient amount delivered to complete the road from White river to Little Rock, as well as some fifteen miles on the secoond or middle division, leaving but thirty miles of iron for future delivery., 156135=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prices continued to tend downward and by the close of the first week in December a further reduction to 58 @ 60c and from 55 to 57 1/2 c, and subsequently, on the following week, to 52 1/2 @ 55c for Yellow, Mixed and White was submitted to by holders--the receipts having been largely in excess of the demand. No further change occurred and the market for the month closed dull as above, with receipts of 23,781 bags., 153440=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The crop of this important cereal in the Southern country generally, for the year 1860, was a partial failure, owing to the dry and unfavorable character of the weather during the early part of the season, which prevented good stands and otherwise impeded the prospects of the growing crop. The yield, therefore, being light, the deficiency was necessarily made up from the northwestern States, where, under more favorable circumstances, an abundant crop was produced; hence we find that the amount of Corn received in this city during the year, and disposed of by our merchants, exceeds by far the operations of any previous year in our history. The market opened on the first of September with a comparatively light stock on hand, supplies having been pretty generally exhausted by the active demand experienced during the two preceding months, and low water in the upper Mississippi having in great part cut off our usual source of supply. The sales of the early part of the month were chiefly from levee, and at 55 @ 60c per bushel for Yellow and Mixed and 60 @ 62 1/2c for White. The market continued steady until the latter part of the month, when stocks having been reduced to a very low point, prices advanced 2 1/2 @ 3c and the month closed firm--the receipts having comprised 16,970 bags. The market for October opened active and buoyant, with more liberal receipts, and by the close of the first week a further advance of 2 @ 3c per bushel had been established, lots of Yellow and Mixed commanding 60 @ 65c and Prime White 67 1/2 @ 70c. The market remained in this condition, with only slight fluctuation, until about the 25th, when with improved navigation and heavy receipts, holders yielded 2 @ 2 1/2c, and the market closed quiet at 60 @ 62 1/2c for, 399557=Return to The Southern Homefront, 1861-1865 Home Page, 204953=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prices for these articles have fluctuated considerably during the year now under review. The year commencing with September 1st, found bagging very firm at from 15 @ 16c per yard for common to extra hand--loom brands-- such as are manufactured in the vicinity of Lexington and Frankfort, Ky.; the \"J. W. South\" brand, manufactured at the penitentiary of that State, ranking at the head of hand-loom brands. At the same time, power-loom bagging was ranging at from 17 to 19c. brands. The power-loom brands sold in this market comprise in part all the brands manufactured in the country, among which may be mentioned the \"Eagle\" and \"Empire Mills\" of St. Louis, and \"Randall's,\" \"Hunt's\" and \"Globe\" Mills, of Kentucky., 177046=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In respect to prices, we find that the average of superfine throughout the year has been $6 50 per barrel, of Fancy $7 50, and of Extra $8 @ 8 50--scarcely equal to that of former seasons. The market opened, 1st September, at $5 60 @ 5 75 for Superfine and $7 50 @ 8 50 for Extras, and the month closed at the same figures. Receipts, 15,138 barrels. During October, with large stocks, prices declined 10 @ 15c on all grades, and continued to tend downward throughout November and December, by which time a decline of 50 @ 75c had been established. Receipts of October, 15,200 barrels; of November, 11,719 barrels, and of December, 16,019 barrels. Early in January, a good demand was expressed, and by the 10th, prices had fully recovered the decline noted. No further fluctuations occurred until the middle of April, when, with the enforcement of the Northern blockade, which it was then thought would materially restrict supplies, prices rallied, and continued to tend upward until the latter part of May, at which time Superfine was selling at $7 25 @ 7 50, and Choice and Fancy brands $8 50 @ 10, as in quality. In the meantime, the receipts of January had comprised 15,368 barrels; of February, 14,773 barrels; of March, 20,786 barrels; of April, 9,325 barrels; of May 9,781 barrels. The immense stocks on hand, June 1st, and the flattering yield of the new wheat crops then being harvested, tended to depress prices, which gradually declined to $6 50 @ 6 75 for Superfine and $8 @ 9 for Extra. From the 1st of July, at which date this decline was generally conceded, up to the present, rates have varied but little from the above figures, at which the market for the month and year closes firm. Receipts of June 9,455 barrels; of July 2,878 barrels, and of August,--barrels. The annexed table exhibits the price of the various grades at the close of each week, throughout the year:, 38939=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As the Presidential election approached, a disposition was manifested to hold off, until the result should be known. Transactions were entered into with less confidence, and more scrutiny was given to the drawers and drawees of bills, than had been the case heretofore. With the election of Abraham Lincoln on the 6th of November, came disaster and trouble. The terrible effects of the triumph of the Abolition candidate were immediately felt. The life-blood of commercial transactions--confidence-- was gone. The acceptances of the largest and most wealthy houses in New Orleans became immediately unsalable at any price, and distrust, suspicion, and loss of credit ruled the hour. A panic took possession of the people; deposits were hurriedly called for. Our banks were depleted of their coin, and so rapidly did one trouble tread upon the heels of another, that, on the 25th day of November, the banks of this State suspended specie payments. This measure was adopted in this city, not so much from necessity as in obedience to the earnest demands of the commercial and business community. The suspension did not, however, produce immediately the good effects which were looked for by those who urged it. For a time, the great staple was unsalable; the price declined to eight cents per pound, and he was a bold man who dared to take a bill based upon a shipment to any house, however high its previous standing. Many of the largest commission houses in New Orleans suspended before the end of November, and it is believed that over three hundred thousand dollars of the banking capital of our city was involved in these suspensions. As time wore on, and the necessities of commerce pressed upon the people, coupled with the conviction that the new Administration could not come into power for four months to come, small sales of cotton were made, the price of the staple gradually recovered, and during the balance of the season, or up to the 1st of April, the usual amount of business was done, and, upon the whole, at satisfactory prices to all concerned. With the month of April, came the war proclamation of the Lincoln Government. Then quickly, 172586=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The receipts of wheat in this market for the year ending September 1st, 1858, were estimated at 300,000 bushels, in 1850 at 125,000 bushels, and in 1860 at 100,000 bushels, the quantity having regularly decreased from year to year. This falling off was occasioned by the continued failure of the crop in this section, from drought and other causes, and did not occasion remark in milling circles, as the causes were perfectly well understood. The crop now under review has, on the contrary, been the largest and most valuable ever produced in this section, and we believe the remark applies with equal force to all portions of the Southern Confederacy. The enforcement of the Northern blockade about the time for planting, caused agriculturalists generally to pay especial attention to the culture of this important cereal. A much larger area of land was sown than ever before, and, with favorable weather for growing, maturing and harvesting, the yield has proven not only the most prolific on record, but of the very best and choicest quality. The meagre receipts of the crop of 1859-'60, during the fall months, prevented the regular operation of our city mills, and but little attention was paid to the article, which, however, found a ready market either for home manufacture or export, at prices ranging from $1 00 to $1 25 for common to prime and choice. The first receipts of the new crop reached the city June 14th --against the 10th of May In 1860--from the plantation of Mr. E. Brooks, in this county, and sold at $150 per bushel. The deliveries during the remainder of the month comprised only 1,375 bags, and the market did not open regularly until about the 10th of July, when the article began to arrive freely, and our mills were in general operation. Prices in the meantime had ranged from $1 to $1 25, but the supply at the above date having exceeded the demand, holders conceded a decline of 5 @ l0c. The receipts of July summed up about 65,000 bushels, and by the close of the month prices had fallen to $1 for prime and choice and 80 @ 90c for inferior and common. During the first two weeks in August there was but little variation from these quotations, but, under the influence of gradually receding receipts and a steady local and considerable shipping inquiry, holders displayed more firmness, and by the l5th an advance of 2 @ 2 1/2c per bushel had been established. No changes of importance have transpired in the market during the past fortnight, and we close our report upon a quiet market at $1 for prime and 80 @ 90c for inferior., 3552=Text scanned (OCR) by Christie Mawhinney Images scanned by Katherine Anderson Text encoded by Katherine Anderson and Jill Kuhn First edition, 2000 ca. 365K Academic Affairs Library, UNC-CH University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 2000., 58049=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SHIPMENTS FOR THE YEAR.--3,784 bales Apples; 145 Agricultural Implements; 285 pieces Bagging; 158; 158 cases Boots and Shoes, 432 barrels Beef; 66 casks 72 tierces Bacon; 425 bags Corn; 925 barrels Cement; 266 boxes Cheese; 341 sacks Coffee; 1,158 packages Dry Goods; 99 do.

This excitement in the market proved of temporary duration, and supplies continuing to pour in with increased vigor, a reaction soon ensued, and by the 3d of May, the market was dull at a decline of 5c. per bushel. Toward the middle of the month, however, the long threatened blockade of the Northern government was placed in operation, and, by the close of the mouth, prices had gradually stiffened, until 65 @ 75c. were the ruling figures. Stocks were ample, and prospects for the coming crops most encouraging. The tendency of the market from June 1st to date has been uniformly downward; prices in view of the reduced inquiry and the very favorable indications of a large yield from the coming crop, gradually giving way until the middle of August, when offerings were freely made at 45 @ 50c., in [ ] ots. During the past two weeks, there has been some little demand, with sales at 50 @ 52 1/2c., 4640=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The electronic edition is a part of the UNC-CH digitization project, Documenting the American South. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This electronic edition has been created by Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

These figures do not include 1,330 hhds. of the crop of 1860-61 produced in Texas, giving a total crop of 230,083 hhds. Of the amount 195,499 hhds. were made by the old process, and 83,263 hhds. were refined, clarified, etc. The shortness of the crop under review was due in great part to the severe and protracted drouth of the early part of the season; the fields were baked by the heat of the sun, and with an entire absence of rain, the cane was parched and withered. Another cause of injury were the storms of August and October, which inundated many plantations, while on others the cane was not only prostrated and rendered comparatively worthless, but many sugar-houses and purgeries were blown down and machinery damaged. The season for grinding, however, proved unusually propitious, and thus much of this damage was retrieved, and an average yield secured., 193089=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An regards the aggregate weight of an equal number of hogs, the returns show an increase of 60,658,249 lbs, or the difference between 410,658,361 lbs in 1859-60 and 479,312,031 lbs in 1860-61. This is equal to exactly 14 1/2 per cent., so we find that by deducting from this the decrease in number, 8 1/2 per cent., we have a net increase of 5 3/4 per cent. as compared with the previous season., 57862=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RECEIPTS FOR THE YEAR.--3,784 bales Cotton; 22 bales Cotton; 22 bags Corn; 1328 head Cattle; 300 bags Cotton Seed, and Sundries., 165418=to pay more attention to the culture of this cereal, with the view of exempting themselves from the necessity of looking to the North for supplies, a more vigorous and systematic effort toward its cultivation was made last spring, and with very gratifying success. The large quantities thus taken for seed purposes, in addition to the demand for consumption, caused a material increase in shipments to this a point, which, from its position, is looked to for supplies by the agricultural districts of several of the interior States, and the receipts were swelled from about 10,000 bags in 1859-'60, to within a fraction of 50,000 bags, or 125,000 bushels, in 1860-'61., 23774=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Among other subjects considered at the July meeting Was that of the proper course to be adopted with reference to the disposition of the coming Cotton and Tobacco crops in view of the blockade and attending circumstances. Resolutions favoring the purchase of the crops referred to by the Government, to be paid for in Treasury notes or drafts, which notes or drafts, it was further recommended, be made a legal currency in the Confederate States, were presented by a committee of the Chamber and unanimously adopted. The resolutions set forth the advantages of such a course, both to the Government and the people-- that the latter would then have a good, sound, and sufficient currency, equal, if not better, than the present bank note system--that the productive energies of the different States will be stimulated, and the Government enabled to borrow from the agricultural resources of her own people a sufficient amount of money to carry on the war; and at the same time bind all her citizens, by interests both patriotic and pecuniary, to uphold her indi nationality., 19621=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Many subjects of vital interest and importance have received the attention of the Chamber of Commerce since its organization, some of which it may not be improper to refer to at this time. Early in the past year numerous complaints were received from foreign and domestic Cotton buyers and manufacturers, that many of the bales sent from this market proved, upon inspection, to be \"mixed-packed,\" containing two or more qualities of the staple, and often intermixed with dust and sand. The manifest injury to the character and standing of our market which this state of affairs would necessarily occasion, if permitted to continue, caused the subject to be laid before the Chamber, and at the regular May meeting a committee of experienced Cotton dealers was appointed to prepare an address to the planting interest upon the subject, inviting their attention to the evil, with a view to its permanent eradication. The report of this committee-- ably reviewing the subject in all its bearings, and recommending the proper course to be adopted in the future-- was soon after submitted, ordered to be printed, and a large number of copies circulated throughout the country trading to Memphis. The high reputation sustained by Memphis Cottons during the past year for cleanliness and proper care in handling and packing, and the entire absence of the complaints above referred to, furnish substantial evidence that the action of the Chamber has not been without the happiest results., 37678=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In our last annual statement of facts and figures, as disclosed by the monetary and financial operations of the year, we gave the records of a season of unexampled prosperity. The country had fully recovered from the disastrous effects of the great financial panic of 1857, and our young city had made vigorous and gigantic strides in her march to greatness and renown. The Exchange dealing of our bankers showed an aggregate for the year of over seventy-three millions of dollars. The year commencing on the 1st of September, 1860, opened brightly. Every material interest of our city was in the highest degree prosperous; and the business transactions of that month and the succeeding month of October were on a scale of magnitude and grandeur, which betokened a future of greater results than had ever been realized in our previous history. Money was in good supply. Exchanges on all points easy, and at the lowest rates of premium--being a par on New York and half per cent. premium on New Orleans. The cotton crop came forward early, the prices being highly remunerative. Holders were willing to meet the market, and bills drawn against shipments were readily negotiated up to the close of October., 9874=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SIR: The commercial year of 1860-'61 having reached its close, it becomes my duty, as Secretary of this institution, to present through you to its members and the public in general, a condensed statement and digest of the business operations of the city during the past twelve months, so far as they may have come under my observation. In the discharge of this task, imposed upon me by the rules of the Chamber, I shall endeavor at all times to bear in mind that facts and figures are the only reliable basis for any correct expose of business and commercial affairs, and shall refrain, as far as possible, from indulging in remarks and speculations upon any and all subjects not warranted by the official figures, tables and statements, herewith presented., 70450=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The average quality of the year's receipts has been much better than usual, the receipts up to the 1st of January being especially remarkable for uniform cleanliness and freedom from dust and sand, The staple, however, was perhaps a shade less desirable than the preceding crop, yet as a whole the yield was more acceptable than ever before in the history of the cotton culture of the country, and as a sequence, commanded more remunerative prices--the political disturbances of the times to the contrary notwithstanding--than were ever before realized by the planting community. For these auspicious results we are in great measure indebted to the unusually favorable character of the eather during the early part of the season, by which the successful gathering of the crop was greatly facilitated. Owing to the early maturing of the crop, picking commenced fully a fortnight earlier than usual, say about the middle of August, and with dry and salubrious weather, with but slight exceptions, from that date until the early part of January, planters had ample opportunity for securing their entire crops in the best possible condition. At the opening of the market, as above, prospects for the coming crop were in the main favorable, but the severe drouth of the two preceding months having materially hsHetied ttic estimated pre viously indulged in, of a yield exceeding the memorable one of 1859-60, holders were firm in their views and confident that full prices would be maintained. The steadily increasing wants of the human family, and the variety of new purposes for which Cotton and Cotton fabrics were required, indicated that a still larger amount would be wanted for consumption, and tended still further to assure dealers that the short crop then anticipated would meet a steady demand and remunerative prices. The full realization of these expectations proved them to have been well founded, for while the market during the year has experienced many and material fluctuations, an accurate comparison shows the average price paid for the staple to have been above that of any preceding year since 1850., 339713=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first half of the year now under review was remarkable for the general dullness which uniformly prevailed in this article, and the low prices ruling throughout --say from 7c. to 10c. below the avarage of the five preceding years. This was due in great part to the largely increased production in those sections from which Memphis was in the habit of drawing her supplies, the heavy shipments to and large stocks on hand in this market, and the general depression in financial affairs, which tended to materially restrict the speculative inquiry and confine operations to the narrow limits of a purely local trade. Hence it was that the market, which opened in September at 18 @ 20c. per gallon for common, gradually declined until January, when offerings were freely made at 14 @ 15c., and several pretty large transactions reported at 13 1/2 @ 13 3/4c. During this period, aside from the depression in prices above referred to, nothing of interest transpired in the market; but, during February and March, with the prospect of an early stoppage of supplies, holders began to exhibit more firmness, and an advance to 19 @ 20c was speedily established. Prices continued steadily to tend upward, and by the middle of June had more than doubled from the lowest point of the season, and speculators coming forward very freely, large sales were made at 35c., stocks in the meantime having been considerably reduced by army supplies and shipments South and interior-wise. From the 1st of June up to the present time, receipts have been to some extent restricted; nevertheless, the article has found its way to this city in pretty large quantities--sufficient to supply the demand and prevent any further advance in prices. The peculiar condition of the market--steadily declining until the lowest point was reached, and then as steadily advancing up to the close of the year--renders a detailed statement of prices uninteresting and unnecessary. We, therefore, dismiss this branch of our report by remarking that stocks at present are fully equal to the demand, with, however, considerable firmness among holders at the above figures., 125663=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the coming crop, very little can at this time be said. Up to the l5th of August, the prospect was favorable for one of the largest yields ever known, but the heavy, protracted, and general rains that have since fallen throughout the entire Cotton-growing region from which we have advices, have materially changed the aspect of affairs, and rendered useless any speculations or estimates as to the extent of the crop. Much--in fact everything--depends upon the character of the weather during the next three or four weeks. The damage already sustained in the shape of rust, shedding of the younger bolls, undue growth, etc., is severe--perhaps irremediable-- and it is only the most favorable weather from this, 155544=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was no change of consequence in the market until the latter part of November, say the 20th, when the new crop beginning to arrive very freely, and with large stocks of the old in dealers' hands, prices began to droop and by the 25th were from 3 to 5c lower. In addition to this, the country demand was less active and the market for the month closed dull at 57 1/2 @ 60c for Yellow and Mixed, and 60 @ 62 1/2c for White (old crop). The new crop was neglected and dragged heavily at 52 1/2 @ 55c. Month's receipts 34,221 bags., 152331=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Passing on to the Molasses trade of the city, we also find a marked improvement in the aggregate as compared with previous years. The extension of our trade has brought hither innumerable customers who never before visited this market, but who have at all times throughout the year found ample stocks from which to make selections, and at prices as favorable, transportation added, as the same article could be purchased in New Orleans. The demand has also been augmented in some degree by the increased consumption, especially on the plantations of this and adjoining sections, where Molasses has tended greatly to supply the place of meats, and become in fact an article of prime necessity. The total yield from the last Sugar crop is estimated at 18,414,550 gallons, against 17,854,100 in 1859-60. The receipts at this point embrace 763,760 gallons, or 19,094 bbls., of which but a limited amount remains on hand. Prices throughout the year have varied but little, as is shown by the preceding table., 126488=time forth that would seem to justify expectations of even an average yield. Our planting friends seem unanimous in the wise determination to withhold their crops from market, until political affairs become more settled. Up to the 31st of August, (the date of doing this report) the first bale of the new crop had not been received in this city. The first bale of last year's crop came to hand on the 2d of August, and the receipts up to the 31st had embraced 275 bales., 143295=the one grown in 1859. But notwithstanding the yield was greatly less, the shipments to and sales in our market have equaled, if not exceeded, those of the commercial year ending Sept. 1st, 1860. The prices paid have been remunerative to the grower. Up to the time of the blockade, the maximum paid was $10; the minimum $2 50 for the lightest description of chaffy Lugs. The average of prices, considering the general inferiority of the weed, was high, up to that time. With the inception of the blockade, operations for a time were suspended, and subsequently in a few instances sales were effected at a small decline; but recently all offering have been taken at figures fully equal to those ruling in the beginning of the season, and the year closes with an active demand, with scarcely any stock on the market. The year's receipts sum up 2,836 hogsheads, and the shipments 2,791 hhds. The reader's attention is directed to the preceding statement of prices current at the close of each week throughout the year., 188191=1st of January, prices in the meantime continuing gradually to decline, and during the first week in that month the market had reached the lowest points of the season, viz: Mess Pork $17; Lard 9 1/2 @ 10 1/2c; Shoulders 7 1/2 @ 8c; Harris 10 @ 11, and Clear and Rib Sides 10 @ 11c. The inquiry for Bacon, during the latter part of January, was pretty generally superseded by Bulk Pork--with which the market was amply supplied at 7c, hog round-- thus tending to a still further depression in the first named article. The demand for dry salted meats continued to prevail during the following four months, closing only with the season, about the first of May, with by far the largest aggregated transactions ever known in this market, vast quantities of the article having been taken for shipment to the St States of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and the Carolinas. A good inquiry was also expressed during this period for all descriptions of Bacon, barrelled Pork and Lard, for the same points, and this, taken in connection with the prospective stoppage of future supplies from the North by virtue of the blockade, caused a material advance in all these articles, Mess Pork, on the 1st of May, commanding $22 @ 23 per barrel; Shoulders 10 @ 10 1/2c; Hams 12 @ 15c; and Ribbed and Clear Sides 13 @ 15c. Bulk Pork also exhibited considerable firmness at 10c for Sides; 8 @ 8 1/2c for shoulders; 9 1/2 @ 10c for Hams, and 9 1/4 @ 9 1/2c for hog round. The market continued steadily to improve, and on the 20th of June a further advance of $3 to $4 per barrel on Mess Pork, and of 2 @ 3c per pound on all qualities of Clear and Joint Bacon had been established.}",
