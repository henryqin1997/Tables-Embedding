For use with any of our high impedance ELF antennas., 100479=These antennas are usually for use below 1000 Hz., 89223=Lightning Detection Band F is useful only for detecting local cloud to ground strikes. May have power line hum noise in this band., 61182=This antenna is very sensitive and allows a simple seismograph to be built for earthquake detection. This antenna will detect large earthquakes over 1000 miles away. Perfect for your use in your DIY seismograph. We like this antenna the best because it is small and very sensitive., 89053=Lightning Detection Band E opens at night for very long range detections. Only short range in daytime. May have power line harmonic hum interference in this band., 60808=This antenna operates in the range of 0.01 Hz to 1 KHz, and is designed for high sensitivity in this range when used for sensing tiny physical motions of a nearby magnet. Typical applications are seismographs and infrasonic microphones and remote motion sensing of moving magnetic or magnetized parts (can detect rotational speeds up to 1000 revolutions per second)., 45608=TUNING DATA: C = 0.47 uF for @ 320 Hz.

This direct input tuned receiver works with our Model \"C\" antennas above on this page, in the range of 10 KHz to 530 KHz., 85866=This AM / LW loopstick antenna is for tuning between 100 KHz - 1710 KHz., 102912=Lightning Detector project 11. 07-16-2011. Uses our Lightning Detection Antenna part # D6T-3KC-BC., 101206=You can greatly boost signal gain by using a pre-amplifier if your equipment does not already have a high impedance input. \"CF\" is a capacitor that controls frequency. Typical values are shown above on this page. Q1 is 2N3904 NPN transistor. R1 is 470 K-ohms. R2 is 1000 - ohms. R3 is 10 K-ohms. C1 is 47 pF. C2 is 0.001 uF., 81340=ANTM4. This 6.5 inch long antenna can be tuned from 530 KHz to 1700 KHz with an external capacitor value of 10 pF to 384 pF. @ 384 pF tunes to 520 KHz. Great for series resonant use in small transmitters or receivers. 1 watt max., 92959=Lightning Detection 'G' band properties: The 'G' band at 500 Hz to 1 KHz allows local lightning ground strikes to be monitored. Range is less than 30 miles. Whistlers extend down to this band, becoming drawn out and slow sounding. Dawn chorus extends down to 700 Hz and up to 1400 Hz this band. Hiss can be heard in this band. Propagation mode is solely through the ground, water, or along earth's magnetic field lines for non-lightning signals originating more than 30 miles away.}",
