The method includes the steps of: receiving GIS data; receiving business data of each branch; determining the geographic area to which each branch belongs, wherein the GIS data in the geographic area will be checked; and, checking whether the GIS data of the geographic area to which each branch belongs are correct based on the business data of each branch. The method and apparatus can automatically check geographic and demographic data of a given city or region. 07-23-2009 Hongfei Cheng, Sunnyvale, CA US Patent application number Description Published 20110208953 EVENT TIME MANAGEMENT IN AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATION WITHOUT A BATTERY-BACKED REAL TIME CLOCK - An electric vehicle charging station, which does not include a battery-backed Real Time Clock, is in a charging station network managed by a charging station network server. Upon booting, the charging station requests actual real time from a remote source. While the charging station has not received the actual real time, it records the time of charging station specific events in a local system time format that resets when the charging station loses power. The charging station maintains the events recorded in their local system time until actual time is received. When actual real time",
