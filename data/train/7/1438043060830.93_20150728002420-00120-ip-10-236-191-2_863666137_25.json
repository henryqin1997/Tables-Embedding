This utility is included with SSSD in the Note sss_cache, invalidates records in the SSSD cache for a user, a domain, or a group. Invalidating the current records forces the cache to retrieve the updated records from the identity provider, so changes can be realized quickly.

SSSD can define multiple domains of the same type and different types of domain. SSSD maintains a separate database file for each domain, meaning each domain has its own cache.

    "textAfterTable": "\u2060Deleting Domain Cache Files All cache files are named for the domain. For example, for a domain named exampleldap, the cache file is named cache_exampleldap.ldb. Be careful when you delete a cache file. This operation has significant effects: Deleting the cache file deletes all user data, both identification and cached credentials. Consequently, do not delete a cache file unless the system is online and can authenticate with a user name against the domain's servers. Without a credentials cache, offline authentication will fail. If the configuration is changed to reference a different identity provider, SSSD will recognize users from both providers until the cached entries from the original provider time out. It is possible to avoid this by purging the cache, but the better option is to use a different domain name for the new provider. When SSSD is restarted, it creates a new cache file with the new name and the old file is ignored. \u206012.2.29.\u00a0Downgrading SSSD When downgrading \u2014 either downgrading the version of SSSD or downgrading the operating system itself \u2014 then the existing SSSD cache needs to be removed.
