            "There are green phones on campus that can be seen from EVERY point on campus. They act as a 911 phone to our campus police, who have a headquarters just south of main campus.",
            "We have the Greek Life, and there are plenty of fraternities and sororities to join if this is what you are interested in. I would suggest doing this your freshman year as after that you don't have much time.",
            "We have several hundred clubs and they range from academic clubs to a winter snowboard and ski club. If you have an interest you can find a club for it. And if not, it is really simple to make your own!",
            "If you like to have fun, but also can balance your school and work life MSU would be a great place for you. But you have to be able to get that balance, if you don't know how to do that it will be difficult for you to focus on studying as there are a lot of activities to participate in around campus.",
            "A lot of people like to take pictures with the Sparty's statue, our mascot. And we have a rock by one of the auditoriums that clubs and organizations can paint for advertising and fun.",
            "This I would say is definitely true, you are getting an education from a Big Ten university and it is definitely doable if you find the right ways to finance your education.",
            "There are a lot of on campus events hosted by our University Activities Board and every campus hall has events on a weekly basis that you can attend. My favorite is the Campus Cinema, they come out with movies that are just out of the theater but not yet on DVD.",
            "Most of the food is okay, nothing amazing as its the cafeteria but it was better than I expected.",
            "Crowded, and they are admitting more and more freshman into the dorms so there is transitional housing. But aside from that the dorms are amazing I lived there the first year and a half and they had everything you needed and more. Your cafeteria's are close to your room and its really quiet.",
            "You can pick the classes right and get easier professors but for the most part it is tough. I am a 3.5 student and right now I am averaging a 3.1 at MSU.",
            "Make sure to balance out your school and extracurricular activities. And if you are looking for a job there are plenty of places to find one on campus.",
            "The sectioned off campus is amazing since you don't have to interact with any non-students or faculty. There are plenty of activities on campus through our University Activities Board, which is a great experience for all incoming students. And It is a well renowned school throughout the country that lives up to its name."

Let's say at this point I'm burnt out and scholarships would help a lot., 787033=There are many different sororities and fraternities at Michigan State. Greek Week is sometime in September or October and is a great way to meet new people and possibly join a fraternity or sorority., 1027473=MSU is in the process of building/ renovating many of their dining halls on campus. In 2010-2011, they built Brody Cafeteria, which is the largest non-military cafeteria in the world. There are always so many selections, such as, sushi, homestyle cooking, a deli, a dessert bar, a salad bar, stir fry, etc. After building that cafeteria and seeing the success rate, they began remodeling other cafeterias (at least one in each neighborhood) like that as well. The head chef of MSU Culinary Services is constantly striving to be better, despite the rising reviews every year., 69503=every meal plan is unlimited, meaning students can go to the cafeteria as many times as they want. this is especially nice for late-night snack runs and going to the cafe just to socialize. the university is in the process of updating all the cafeterias. three new cafeterias have opened since 2007, and all look similar to a large mall food court. these cafeterias give students many different meal options and are generally better than the other cafeterias. currently the cafeterias in case, brody, and snyder-phillips halls are the best. this section gets three stars because of some of the older cafeterias that have not yet been updated. the new cafeterias would get five stars. regardless of which dorm students call home, they can eat in any cafeteria. students who live off-campus can also purchase smaller meal plans, and eat on campus at their leisure., 180472=It's great. There is food all the way up until 12:00 A.M in some halls!, 1002695=If you are interested in MSU, keep your GPA up and apply early! MSU had over 30K applications and accepted only 8K for the fall of 2012., 1122862=During finals week there is this thing called the Midnight Scream. At 12:00 am every night the students on campus let out a loud scream. This scream is to relieve the stress of finals week., 335993=I'm a non-traditional student trying to complete my first degree so that I can stop working dead end jobs and help to take care of my daughter like a man should. I am a really hard worker. Working two jobs and manage to complete 38 credits without falling below a 3 point is an accomplishment I can live with, in addition I still make the time for my little girl. I would like some assistance to make life a little easier as it is a challenge. I did much of it by myself but I'm no superhero and so now I am asking for help. I have a bill now for over $1800 for this semester., 46431=currently i am enrolled for 14 credits. Monday and Wednesday and Friday i have college algebra from 10:20-11:10 and then on Monday and Wednesday i have Cse101(computer class) from 12:40 to 2:30. my math class is only challenging because i cant understand my teacher, thankfully the book text is really helpful and the online homework, extra practice and so on, really helps me understand the material i don't get in class, and there are reviews for every test. Cse101 is challenging, but I'm glad that it's giving me a broad understanding of Word, Excel, Access, And web design. Then on Tuesdays and Thursdays i have Com225 (intro to interpersonal communication) i really like this class, i have it from 10:20 to 11:40 and its taught by 2 professors that are married, steve and kelly. they are so engaging and are really cool and interesting people. then from 12:40 to 2:30 i have ISS210 (society and the individual) i really like the professor in this class too, he's very versed on the information he teaches, but you really have to pay attention to catch everything he says. its not like in highschool where you can just do the work and in the process you'll get the material, you have to be the one to motivate yourself to go to class and listen and thats how you'll understand the material. then i have Yoga from 4:10 to 5:00. 14 credits isn't too overwhelming i would say, its keeps me busy for the first half of the day, then i really have the rest of the day to do all my work and other extra-curricular activities., 171561=Michigan State is going through a remodeling process with many of the dorms around campus so the quality of living is much higher. The building I am living in was remodeled in 2011 and I love it. Most sophomores preferred to live in this building because it was more convenient than living in apartments., 202325=Apply Early! There's nothing better than feeling the stress and anxiety of the college applications process being over. It's also beneficial to you as a student to apply by the first week of November because MSU is really good about responding promptly. I received my acceptance letter within 3 weeks and it was great to know that I am already getting into schools!}",

You are no longer in the same playing field as high school. College is whole new game. You need to establish independence because at college you are completely on your own. Time management is also very critical in college with so many opportunities and things to do. And if you've always been a good student during high school and felt like you never needed to study, trust me, you WILL need to study! Many of the professors require you to learn and grasp knowledge beyond the material they teach in lectures or labs. Bang for the buck As a public college, the cost of tuition is much less than smaller private schools. In addition, a larger, more notable college, like MSU, can offer",
