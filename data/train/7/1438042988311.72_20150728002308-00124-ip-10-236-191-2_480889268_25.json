    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{114408=The fourth admixture was then \u201cstripped\u201d by subjecting it to a gentle vacuum distillation (100\ufffd20 mm Hg) at 52\ufffd\ufffd2\ufffd C. until most of the water/methanol was removed. A residual amount (a few weight-percent) of water remained in the dried product. At the end of the stripping process, the admixture was diluted to 50% solids with a 14:1 weight-ratio solvent of isopropyl alcohol:distilled water. This 50% solids admixture was further diluted to 25% solids with the same solvent mixture. About 0.7 parts by weight photoinitiator (commercially available from Ciba Geigy Corp., Hawthorne, N.Y., under the trade designation \u201cIRGACURE 184\u201d) was also added., 115076=The ceramer composition was then coated onto PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) and polycarbonate substrates at a thickness of about 4 to about 5 micrometers using conventional flow coating techniques. Each coated substrate was then flash dried at about 60\ufffd C. for 2.5 minutes in an air circulating oven to ensure that the majority of the isopropanol was driven off. Finally, the coating was cured on a conveyor belt of a UV light processor using a high pressure mercury lamp (Model QC 1202, available from PPG Industries, Plainfield, Ill.). The process conditions were 16.5 meters/minute, 410 volts, energy 90 mJ/cm2, and an air atmosphere., 24551=This application is a continuation-in-part of prior application Ser. Nos. 09/209,117, filed Dec. 10, 1998, now abandoned, which was a continuation-in-part of prior application Ser. No. 09/072,506, filed May 4, 1998 now abandoned., 108785=The test method assesses the adhesion of coating films to substrates by applying and removing pressure-sensitive adhesive tape over cuts made in a film of the coating composition. A crosshatch pattern with 3 cuts in each direction was made in the coating on the substrate. Then a pressure-sensitive adhesive tape was applied over the crosshatch and removed. Adhesion was evaluated by comparing descriptions and illustrations. The cutting tool was a sharp razor blade, scalpel, knife or other cutting device which had a cutting edge in good condition. A cutting guide was used to ensure straight cuts. The tape was 1 inch (25 mm) wide semi-transparent pressure-sensitive adhesive tape with an adhesion strength of 36 plus or minus 2.5 oz/in. (40 plus or minus 2.8 g/mm) when tested in accordance with ASTM Method D 1000 incorporated by reference herein in its entirety., 106122=This test measures the Taber abrasion of the ceramer composition when coated on a substrate and was performed according to ASTM D1044 (Standard Method for Resistance of Transparent Plastics to Surface Abrasion), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, the test method involved abrading a sample on a TABER ABRASER\u2122 tester for 100, 300 and 500 cycles using a 500 gram load with a CS-10F wheel at room temperature. After each cycle of exposure to the abrasive wheels the percent change in haze was measured., 107887=Briefly, a sample was exposed to a 6500 Joule/second xenon burner filter through borosilicate inner and outer filters at 0.35 W/m2 in a Water Cooled Xenon Arc Model 65XWWR Weathering Chamber, available from Atlas Electric Devices Co. (Chicago, Ill.) for repetitive cycles of 102 minutes at about 63\ufffd C. followed by 18 minutes with a water spray. To provide a ceramer coating passing this test for a particular substrate, the ceramer coating must be capable of withstanding at least 1000 hours of exposure under these conditions with no significant yellowing, whitening, or other discoloration., 54585=Crosslinkable silane components suitable for use in the ceramer composition of the present invention are commercially available from numerous sources. Generally, suitable crosslinkable silane components contain at least one hydrolyzable silane moiety and at least one polymerizable moiety other than a silane moiety. The polymerizable moiety preferably contains either (meth)acrylate, allyl, styryl, amino, or epoxy functionalities, while the hydrolyzable silane group is usually an alkoxy silyl moiety (generally methoxy or ethoxy) which serves as a binding site to hydroxy-functional inorganic substrates via displacement of the alkoxy groups. Additional information concerning crosslinkable silane components may be found in the book by E. P. Pleuddeman (\u201cSilane coupling Agents\u201d, Plenum Press, New York, 1982, pp. 20-23 and 97) as well as in technical reports by S. Sterman and J. G. Marsden entitled \u201cTheory of Mechanisms of Silane Coupling Agents in Glass Reinforced and Filled Thermoplastic and Thermosetting Resin Systems\u201d, Union Carbide Corporation, New York, and \u201cA Guide to Dow Corning Silane Coupling Agents\u201d, Dow Corning Corporation, 1985, pp. 2-13, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein., 112325=This test measures the Taber abrasion of the ceramer composition when coated on a leather substrate and was performed according to ASTM D3884, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. This test method measures the abrasion resistance of the surface coating on leather and synthetic leathers using a rotary rubbing action under controlled pressure. The Taber abrasion machine used was Model number 5130 available from Taber Industries, Tonawanda, N.Y. The samples were cut to about 103\ufffd3 millimeters with a 7\ufffd1 millimeter hole punched in the center of the test sample. attached to the Taber disc with S-36 cardboard backer (available from Taber Industries). The testing was conducted using conditioned H-22 abrasive wheels with 1000 gram weights. A sample failed when a wear area of about 2 millimeters depth was observed., 119108=Example 5 was prepared as described in Example 1, except a silica/alumina mixture was substituted for the silica Thus, 56.2 parts by weight of PETA were preheated to about 49\ufffd C. and then combined with 35.3 parts by weight of silica (88 parts by weight of 40% solids NALCO\u2122 2327, 20 nm) and 1 part by weight sodium aluminate (NaAlO2) to form a first admixture. A second admixture of 7.8 parts by weight of A-174 and 0.8 parts by weight of the compound of Formula (11) was prepared and added to the first admixture with stirring to form a third admixture. In a weighing tray, 0.15 parts by weight BHT and 0.02 parts by weight phenothiazine (both based on the 56.2 parts by weight PETA) were mixed together and then added to the third admixture to form a fourth admixture., 222119=Two white full grain leathers (available from Sadesa, Buenos Aires, Argentina) designated #2040 and #2059 were spray coated with the ceramer composition of Example 1, using a commercial sprayer and holding the leather sample in a horizontal position. The coating weight was 11 grams/meters2. The samples were then oven dried for about 10 minutes at 70\ufffd C. The samples were then cured using a UV chamber with mercury vapor lamps (power setting\u2014300 Joules/seconds/meters2) at a speed of 6 meters/minute.}",
