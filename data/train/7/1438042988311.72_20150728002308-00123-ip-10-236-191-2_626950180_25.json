In 2007, the parliament\u2019s audit committee summoned a number of ministers and high-level officials, and the issue of dereliction of duty in the ministries was discussed in public., 208035=The committee, therefore, wanted to learn more about how the Danish ombudsman institution functions, and the Danish embassy in Vietnam granted approximately USD 0.2 million to the project. Among other things, this has meant that officials from the Vietnamese Parliament have visited Denmark and other European countries in order to study different models for handling complaints. Three seminars have been held in Vietnam concerning the subject, the most recent taking place in November 2007, at which the Danish Ombudsman, Hans Gammeltoft-Hansen, was present., 428519=The annual gearing rate is an expression of the scale of the Danish deliveries that each Danish development krone generates. In 2007, the rate was 2.3 and was calculated on the basis of projects that had been already approved and which had in 2007 received final commitments after having been subjected to a competitive tender procedure., 930746=(Statement by a majority of the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee. From the Committee\u2019s report on the selection of future partner countries in relation to Danish development assistance, 23 May 1989)., 23906=In 2007 the Government maintained its focus on Denmark\u2019s global responsibilities and a strong, mutually-binding cooperative engagement with developing countries. The important role development assistance plays in foreign policy was emphasised, and a concentrated effort was targeted at some of the primary challenges and opportunities the poorest people in the world are currently facing., 34139=Danida\u2019s Annual Report provides information about some of the results of Danish development and environmental assistance to developing countries in 2007. The annual report is divided into two parts: international development cooperation and Danish development cooperation., 612178=Despite the political turbulence that the UNDP was subjected to in 2007, there was broad agreement in the Executive Board on the UNDP\u2019s central role in the multilateral system. At the same time, the Administrator of the UNDP, Kermal Dervis, who took over the position in 2006, has clearly given increased priority to the cooperation with other UN organisations and with national partners in programme countries in order to promote joint UN programming and to ensure that the UN\u2019s efforts are demand-driven and of better quality., 636075=The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was established in January 2002 as a private-public partnership outside the UN system and aims to mobilise increased support for the fight against the three diseases, which together cost six million lives each year. The fund is supported by voluntary contributions from governments, private funds, enterprises and private individuals, and it provides support to both public and private initiatives as well as NGO projects in developing countries that aim at providing prevention, treatment, care and support for those affected by HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria., 56430=ADRA\u2019s radio project in Central Africa is just one of many projects that are financed by the special pool of USD 25.7 million that was allocated to empower women in Africa in connection with the 2007 Appropriations Act., 317537=These are the challenges facing the global climate change negotiations, which in 2007 culminated at the 13th UN Climate Change Conference in Bali, Indonesia, in December. At this conference, it proved possible \u2013 on a dramatic extra conference day \u2013 to get all countries to endorse a so-called roadmap leading up to the 15th UN Climate Change Conference due to be held in Copenhagen in 2009. Here, the goal will be to reach a global agreement on how greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced and on how the efforts in the world\u2019s poorest countries to combat climate change can be enhanced., 617616=Denmark is among the 10-15 largest donors to the UNEP, to which it made a non-earmarked contribution of USD 2.8 million in 2007 to the UNEP\u2019s general work and USD 5.3 million in various earmarked contributions. With the earmarked contributions, support is awarded to, among other things, two centres with which the UNEP collaborates in Denmark: DHI (Dansk Hydraulisk Institut), where work is carried out with environmentally sound management of water resources, and the Ris\u00f8 DTU National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy, where work is carried out with climate change adaptation and with the link between energy, climate and sustainable development., 350105=Is it not absolute lunacy to send a baby elephant on a long-haul flight in an attempt to ensure it a new life after its mother has been shot by poachers? Maybe. But this is exactly what the Zambian voluntary organisation, Conservation Lower Zambezi (CLZ), did in November 2007., 167372=Source: OECD. Note*: In the absence of the final figures for 2006, preliminary figures have been used., 465885=The private sector is the driving force in the government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy, and it is therefore extremely critical that the necessary framework for the development of the private sector has not been put in place. A number of important elements for Benin\u2019s economy are pulling in a downward direction \u2013 including a low dollar rate, high energy prices and an unfavourable price for cotton, which is Benin\u2019s key export product. The lack of reforms and unfavourable external conditions has resulted in a rise in poverty in Benin: 36 per cent of the population lived under the official poverty line in 2006, whereas in 2002 it was 28 per cent., 269701=With Danish financing of negotioation expertise for the chief negotiotor, Rieck Machea, Resolution 1325 specifically and its consideration for women and children received a place in earnest on the agenda in May and June 2007, when the parties reached an agreement on a set of principles for judicial settlements and reconciliation. The Danish support involved, i.a., the financing of visits and consultations with the LRA in order to ensure that the draft of the agreement text would be realistic to the rebel group. In the agreement the parties commit to showing special consideration for women and children, to considering the points of view of women and children and their experience during the work of rebuilding and reconciliation, and to protecting the dignity, personal integrity and safety of women and children., 241042=Within 24 hours after the town of Musa Qala in Helmand Province officially fell and came under the control of the government, the Afghan Minister for Education, with Danish support, launched an extensive education campaign in the area. Through a prompt and visible civil effort, the Afghan Government was able to build further on their military success and thereby enhance the process of reconciliation in the area. Musa Qala has been shifting between Taliban and government control throughout 2007 and it was, therefore, especially important to mobilise the people in the area to support the central government now., 88888=There has also been significant progress in terms of the occurrences of armed conflicts. In 1992 West and Central Africa especially were characterised by wars and conflicts. On the other hand, a comparison with 2007 indicates that a large number of countries have, in the meantime, managed to put their differences behind them. A recent example of this is Sierra Leone, which in 2007 conducted a democratic election and thereby put an end to years of unrest and civil war., 431150=The countries in Africa were previously only sporadically represented among the recipient countries of projects under the Mixed Credits Programme. As late as 2003, all grant-approved projects were located in Asia. However, in 2003 the Mixed Credits Programme launched a targeted strategy with a view to realising more projects in Denmark\u2019s programme countries in Africa. And the efforts have produced results. Already in 2005, Africa became the main recipient of mixed credits, and this position was consolidated in 2006, when as much as 71 per cent of the grants was awarded to Mozambique and Zambia. In 2007, Africa accounted for almost 44 per cent of the total grants., 635091=In 2007, Denmark awarded USD 4.6 million to GAVI, which has achieved good results. Since 2000, GAVI has contributed to preventing around 3 million children from dying of diseases that could be prevented with the help of vaccines. The Danish assessment is that GAVI works with a number of interesting, innovative elements, but that GAVI\u2019s targeted contributions to increased vaccination efforts encounter a number of constraints arising from the generally weak national health systems in the countries that GAVI supports., 430200=With the full utilisation of the frame also in 2007, it is clearly evident that the adopted restraint in the size of grants awarded in conjunction with the use of tightened development assistance screening has been necessary. Projects that have only had a few outstanding items or which have demonstrated good progress have been assigned high priority in the strategic goals for 2007. The Committee\u2019s priorities can be summarised in the following main areas:, 26259=Promoting good governance and fighting corruption, along with fighting HIV/AIDS, constituted two other special priorities for the Government in 2007. At the same time, the climate was moved higher up on the agenda, both internationally and in Denmark. It is now clear that developing countries will be hit the hardest by climate change. If development assistance is to be useful in the long term, then the climate must be an integrated part of the endeavour. Therefore, the Government has, among other things, taken the initiative to climate-proof Danish assistance., 203663=In 2007, 23 staff members from the IHB were posted on assignments in Hebron, Afghanistan, Sudan, Uganda, Somaliland and Kosovo. Their tasks varied greatly in nature. For example, four civilian advisers were sent to Afghanistan as a part of the Provincial Reconstruction Teams. The assignments were later taken over by actual Danida advisers, but members of the IHB can typically be recruited at short notice and take care of the necessary acute activities in a post-conflict area. Moreover, the IHB has sent an adviser to the EU\u2019s programme for promoting the rule of law in Afghanistan., 81282=Denmark, together with Germany, constituted the Western co-chairs when the Africa Partnership Forum convened in May. The Forum gathered together Africa\u2019s most important cooperation partners, and it resulted in a number of recommendations for the G8 Summit Meeting on 6-7 June, which Germany is chairing., 917712=The following is a reproduction of the Danish International Development Cooperation Act, cf. Consolidated Act no. 541 of 10 July 1998, as amended by Section 2 of Act no. 410 of 6 June 2002 and by Act no. 411 of 6 June 2002., 871125=That is the short and laconic statement in the Danish Tanzania Strategy from 2007 effectively ending years of Danish support to roads and agriculture. The donors, including Denmark, are to concentrate on fewer sectors in the individual countries in order to achieve a better distribution of the work of the donors in each of the sectors. And this practice is well underway. Of the 59 sector programmes in all that Denmark supported in 2005, approximately 1/5 are being phased out or have already been discontinued. Previously, Denmark typically provided support to between four and six sectors in every programme country. That figure is to be reduced to between three and four., 893368=In recent years, there have been dramatic changes in development assistance and development policy. Project support has been replaced by programme and, later, budget support, all in an effort to pave the way for the recipient countries to assume ownership. The changes culminated, so far, in 2005 with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. The declaration stipulates that responsibility for developing capacity rests with the recipient countries, and that the role of the donors is to support this development. This requires advisers to assume a new role, and changes have indeed taken place. However, there is widespread concern that these changes are taking place too slowly and that there is resistance to implementing the changes that are necessary., 873328=On 10 September 2007 the Kenyan Government and no fewer than 17 donors \u2013 or development partners as they are known in today\u2019s development jargon \u2013 signed the Kenya Joint Assistance Strategy. Among the signatories were the USA, the UN, the European Commission, the World Bank, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Japan \u2013 and Denmark, which, moreover, was the chair for the donor group., 326180=The conference was attended by high-political representatives of all the member countries, as well as by representatives from China and Burma, through which the Mekong River runs, and from the Commission\u2019s many donors. The conference resulted in the adoption of a joint declaration together with a number of specific measures designed to strengthen the Commission\u2019s work. The conference has also generated renewed momentum in getting the Commission to play the role envisaged for it when it was created in 1995., 48800=The dilemmas between economic growth and poverty and between the role of the private sector and the state\u2019s maintenance of social needs have, however, not been solved. When the UN General Assembly adopted the eight Millennium Development Goals back in 2000, the perspective of growth in the first draft was almost absent and the pendulum had been swung back. Since then, this aspect has been rectified and the Millennium Development Goals are now an expression of a strategy that focuses on long-term, cross-cutting issues in Danish development policy: the role of women, the problem of HIV/AIDS, the population issue, the situation of children, healthcare, education, the environment, etc. and, that not least commits the international donor community to the same development policy priorities that have characterised Danish assistance for a number of years., 392282=In Chuquisaca, the programme\u2019s activities have contributed to such dramatic increases in production that the families that have been involved since 2005 have experienced an average rise in income of 16 per cent. The agricultural programme\u2019s goal that the farming families involved must achieve an income rise of 20 per cent by the end of the programme in 2010 is therefore within sight., 324283=To address the situation, the four countries signed an intergovernmental agreement in 1995 to establish the Mekong River Commission (MRC). The agreement was far-reaching and unusual in that the countries would discuss and decide on sustainable utilisation of the water from the Mekong River. An intergovernmental political council and a secretariat were established, which were originally located in Cambodia, but have since moved to Laos., 516508=The presidential and parliamentary elections that were held on 27 December dominated the political landscape in 2007. The election campaign began already during the first half of the year, where various political groupings announced their involvement. The three parties that ended up dominating the picture were PNU, which is an alliance around the sitting president, Kibaki; the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), which had been at the forefront of the campaign against the rejected draft constitution in 2005; and ODM Kenya, which is a faction of ODM. The result was the re-election of President Kibaki, amidst loudly voiced allegations of electoral fraud from both the opposition and electoral observers. By the end of the year, Kenya had been thrown into a serious political and security crisis that led to bloody confrontations and raised serious questions about the political stability that for decades had characterised Kenya., 853638=In 1999 the Government of Mozambique undertook a comprehensive reform of the agricultural sector, PROAGRI. The first phase of the reform ran through 2005 and a total of 12 different donors contributed 88 per cent of the financing. Denmark\u2019s contribution was USD 21.7 million and constituted a part of total Danish agricultural support for the period, which totalled USD 51.4 million. The evaluation of the first phase showed, among other things, that the measurement of the results had not been satisfactory., 258284=Since the brutal dictator Siad Barre was overthrown in 1991, Somalia has not had an actual government that controlled the entire country. Somalia is not just a fragile state but has become the epitome of a failed or collapsed state. It is estimated that the many years of war have cost a million lives in a country that has a population of only nine million. Between one and two million Somalis are estimated to have fled throughout the world. In Kenya alone there are more than 150,000., 482103=It has proved difficult in the constitution-drafting process to build bridges across disagreements among government supporters and the opposition, and this led to a polarisation in society during 2007. The government parties wish to promote a constitution with expanded autonomy for indigenous people and with centralised control of important natural resources. The opposition and the departments in the low country desire extensive autonomy that gives the departments a considerable right of disposal over natural resources. In December, the Constituent Assembly approved a draft constitution without the participation of the opposition\u2019s representatives. At the end of the year, the situation had therefore reached a deadlock., 937213=Jan Mosbech Kieler Divisional Director Danish Council of Consulting Architects and Engineers, 263240=In 2007 ECOWAS went a step further and, with Danish assistance, prepared a framework agreement for how ECOWAS is to react if a conflict threatens in one of the member countries., 1004334=SAARC South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation Established in 1985, it comprises Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Its aim is to promote economic and social development in its member states. http://www.saarc-sec.org, 427377=In recent years, the focus has been on holding so-called reverse TechChange events, where Danish enterprises are invited to participate in delegations to developing countries with a view to matchmaking with local partners. In 2007, Danish enterprises participated in TechChange delegations to five developing countries, namely Egypt, Kenya, Nicaragua, South Africa and Vietnam, where the focus was on the IT, dairy and energy sectors., 329341=The Danish support to coastal management in Egypt has now come to an end. It has been decided to phase out Egypt as a Danish programme country by the end of 2008. But the Danish model for coastal management will live on, as Egypt has decided to formulate management plans for all coastal stretches in Egypt within the next ten years using the Danish-financed plan as a model., 569991=The increased trade also contributed to an expected growth of 6.2 per cent (GNP) in 2007. Real growth, however, was significantly lower, as Uganda had a population growth of approx. 3.4 per cent in 2007. However, poverty has fallen in Uganda \u2013 from 56 per cent of the population in 1992 to 31 per cent by the end of 2006. This progress in relation to poverty reduction means that Uganda is on the way to achieving its own poverty reduction target of 28 per cent by 2013/14., 342515=In connection with the UN General Assembly in New York in the autumn, the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, took the initiative to organise a special climate summit on 24 September. The aim of the summit was to get the entire UN system \u2013 and not just the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), whose headquarters are in Bonn \u2013 to take the climate change issue more seriously. Denmark used the opportunity to convene an event with Al Gore as the keynote speaker. The event aimed at gathering support for a lasting agreement at the Climate Change Conference in Bali and was co-organised by the host countries of the climate change conferences in 2006-2008, namely Kenya, Indonesia and Poland., 207008=It is a far cry from Vietnam\u2019s one-party system to the Danish multi-party system. Nevertheless, there are several elements of Danish democracy that have inspired the Vietnamese, for example the Danish ombudsman institution. The Vietnamese became aware of this institution in 2006 when a representative of the office of the Danish Ombudsman visited Vietnam as a part of the preparation for a unified Danish support programme for good governance in Vietnam., 630273=UNICEF: Already in 2005, more than 15 million children had lost one or both of their parents to HIV/AIDS. Altogether, 80 per cent of these children live in Sub-Saharan Africa, and in the period 2007-09 UNICEF will receive USD 11.0 million for the work to help orphans in Africa., 885668=The Tanzania evaluation is an example of the new type of evaluations that follow the recommendations set out in the Paris Declaration of 2005 regarding more effective aid. Evaluations must be joint evaluations which to a greater extent are controlled by the recipient countries and to a lesser extent focus on the activities of the particular donors., 423867=In 2007, Danish pension funds invested a total of USD 45.4 million in six Vietnamese companies and one Egyptian enterprise. This is the result so far of a collaboration that was initiated in 2005 between Danish pension funds and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark., 211339=Almost all work at the World Bank came to a halt in the spring of 2007 when charges of abuse of office were made against Paul Wolfowitz. It was only when a new president, Robert Zoellick, took office in the summer of 2007 that action was again taken towards establishing the trust fund. It is now expected that the trust fund will finally be created in the middle of 2008. In 2007 a Danish contribution of USD 4.6 million to the trust fund was approved., 275268=More countries and people than ever before are being affected by natural disasters. In the period between 1975 and 2005 there was a six-fold increase in the number of natural disasters, and since 1990 three times as many people have been affected by the disasters. Many experts consider the many weather-related disasters to be conneced with climate change., 622057=Already at the first session in the UNEP Governing Council in February 2007, around seven months after Steiner\u2019s arrival, the world\u2019s environment ministers expressed their great faith and confidence in his leadership and his initiatives to strengthen the organisation., 136458=Goal 8 involves the rich countries\u2019 commitments. On several occasions the rich countries have committed themselves to increasing their assistance generally and especially to the poorest of the developing countries and to Africa. However, they have not lived up to their promises. Nor does it look good in terms of trade. The negotiations in the World Trade Organisation, WTO, concerning the Doha Round have not made any progress since 2005., 140895=It is the Government\u2019s objective that two-thirds of Denmark\u2019s bilateral assistance should, in the long run, go to Africa. In 2007, 61 per cent of bilateral assistance went to the continent. As a part of consolidating the bulk of the poverty-reduction effort in Sub-Saharan Africa, programme cooperation with Egypt, Bhutan and Vietnam is gradually being phased out., 552683=One of the top sources of income for Nicaragua is remittances from immigrants in the USA. However, the growth in this form of income fell in 2007 due to the economic downturn in the USA. These remittances exceed the total donor support figure to Nicaragua of USD 650 million., 241666=The model for support lies in extension of the education jiirga that was carried out for the rest of Helmand. Thus the Minister on Education made commitments to the local population to carry out school construction etc. in the areas reclaimed from the Taliban in exchange for the local people\u2019s support for the initiative. The Danish embassy has given commitments to support the initiative with USD 0.46 million in 2008. The money will especially go to financing the reopening of schools and construction of new schools in the area., 451535=The biogas facility will reduce the emission of harmful greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The electricity production is CO2-neutral and the facility will especially reduce the emission of methane, a greenhouse gas that is 20 times more potent than CO2. For this reason, the project has been approved as a so-called CDM project. This stands for Clean Development Mechanism and means that the project can sell its greenhouse gas saving as CER (Certified Emission Reduction) quotas, in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol. Agreement has been reached with the Danish Environmental Protection Agency to purchase initially around half of the CER quotas that the project generates in the period 2008-2012., 429556=It has been decided that the Report from the Danish Committee for Mixed Credits is to be included in Danida\u2019s Annual Report. This chapter therefore replaces the Committee\u2019s Report from 2007., 598156=But for several of the Member States, the role of donor is still relatively new and untried, and therefore the 12 new Member States seek inspiration and guidance from the 15 old Member States, including Denmark. In December 2007, Slovenia hosted an EU12 roundtable meeting with development assistance as the theme, where the Danish Minister for Development Cooperation was invited to attend as an external speaker and moderator in order to tell about Denmark\u2019s long experience with development cooperation., 73608=The election in Kenya 27 December 2007 was not a victory for democracy. However, in one respect it was a sucess: the number of female members of the newly-elected parliament increased by about 70 per cent. Admittedly, the increase was from a modest nine members to a still modest 14 members, but it represented great progress nonetheless., 199380=In 2007 a Danish-supported effort against corruption in Zambia contributed to Zambia\u2019s former president, Chiluba, being found guilty of corruption. This is an illustration of the fact that Denmark\u2019s support to fighting corruption is not just meant to ensure that there is no misuse of Danish assistance, but also to make the recipient countries better able to monitor and prosecute corruption in general., 100103=Asiatisk Plads in Copenhagen is the home of the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but 15 June 2007 it was also home to a large number of representatives from a number of Asian countries and anyone else interested in Asian affairs. They had been invited to participate in the launching of the Asia Strategy and provided samples of Asian culture for all the senses and in all shapes and sizes. So, for once, Asiatisk Plads swarmed with Asians., 145240=In 2006 the economies in the developing countries grew on average by over seven per cent and thus reached a growth rate of over five per cent for the fourth year in a row. However, the growth was greatest in China and India but applied to all development regions. The developing countries experienced a capital influx of USD 571 billion, which was an increase of around 20 per cent in relation to 2005., 308773=The GFDRR was formed in 2005 in order to support the implementation of the UN\u2019s international agreement on disaster-preparedness and in order to assist low and middle-income countries in integrating disaster-preparedness into their national development policies. Denmark was one of the driving forces behind the formation of the GFDRR and in October 2007 was selected as the first chair of this global facility., 519447=Denmark\u2019s largest programme is within health, and here in 2007 Denmark supported programmes for medicine supply as well as maintenance and running of the local medical clinics. In addition, Denmark covered the costs of employing 1,200 district nurses out in the clinics, where they focus particularly on fighting HIV/AIDS., 71465=This will make Denmark UNIFEM\u2019s eighth largest donor in 2008, but Denmark is, however, still not among UNIFEM\u2019s largest donors. In recent years the organisation has experienced a significant general increase in donor contributions, and in 2007 donations amounted to over USD 100 million for the first time. Of this amount, just under half was core contributions, meaning non-earmarked funds for UNIFEM\u2019s general work. The record was due especially to large increases by UNIFEM\u2019s largest donors. For example, both Norway and Spain increased their total contributions to just about USD 21 million in 2007., 520447=With a point of departure in the environmental sector programme, Denmark launched a process at the end of 2007 that is designed to ensure integration of climate considerations in the Danish support to selected sectors. Climate-proofing of development assistance takes place in close collaboration with other donors., 569152=The peace negotiations have led to a significantly improved security situation in the northern part of the country, and on 15 October 2007 President Museveni launched a rebuilding plan for the region, the so-called Peace, Recovery and Development Plan (PRDP) for Northern Uganda., 593423=2007 was the year when the most of the world fully recognised that global warming is one of the greatest and most worrying challenges facing the world, a fact which was confirmed by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which won high praise its fourth report and \u2013 together with Al Gore \u2013 was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. It was also encouraging that countries throughout the world were in agreement that the response to the challenge had to be global and negotiated into place at COP15 (15th Conference of the Parties) in Copenhagen in 2009. The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, flew especially to Bali when the negotiations looked on the verge of collapsing and contributed to the pressure that ensured an agreement was reached. Ban Ki-moon, who took over as Kofi Annan\u2019s successor as Secretary General at the beginning of 2007, personally regards the agreement in Bali as the UN system\u2019s greatest success in 2007., 594927=The EU contributes over half of the world\u2019s total development assistance. EU assistance comprises both the individual assistance awarded by EU Member States and Community assistance, which is administered by the EU Commission and constitutes around 10 per cent of the total assistance. The Community\u2019s development cooperation comprises a total of more than 100 countries and is an integral part of the political and economic relations between the individual Member States and the EU. In 2007, Denmark\u2019s contribution to the Community assistance was USD 241.3 million. Through this assistance, Denmark is indirectly, but actively and positively, present also in the many developing countries and activities that Denmark supports through bilateral assistance., 184563=In 2007 Nepal received USD 49.6 million in Danish bilateral development assistance. The assistance was concentrated around four areas: education, the environment and renewable energy, democracy and good governance as well as the peace process and conflict prevention., 467010=Despite an inadequate achievement of goals in the overall national poverty reduction strategy, there was satisfactory progress and momentum in the individual Danish-supported programmes in 2007. In the agricultural sector programme, however, no major progress was made within the components targeted at the public sector, and the efforts are too dispersed to have an immediate effect on poverty. Denmark wishes to develop the economy in the rural districts, for example - based on the existing agricultural and transport sector programmes \u2013 by placing emphasis on the private sector and market access. Agriculture is the only sector in Benin where it would be possible to increase employment in the short and medium term., 965196=At present Denmark is giving budget support to the following programme countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mozambique, Tanzania and Vietnam. The amount of budget support varies from country to country. In 2006 between 6 percent (Mozambique) and 29 per cent (Vietnam) of the country frame in the six countries was disbursed as budget support. A total of USD 50.2 million in budget support was used in 2006. This corresponds to approx. 9 per cent of the country frames for the programme countries and 3.8 per cent of total bilateral assistance. Thus, budget support comprises a limited share of total development assistance. Denmark never grants budget support alone, but always in cooperation with other donors. This, however, does not alter the fact that it is possible for Denmark to take independent Danish steps if necessary. Thus, in Tanzania in 2007 Denmark will hold back a disbursement of budget support as a consequence of delays in reforms concerning anti-corruption in 2006., 276259=Denmark bilaterally contributed USD 2.8 million to the humanitarian effort after cyclone Sidr, and DKK 16.5 million to the humanitarian effort after the flooding in Africa in 2007., 421415=And it worked: A Kenyan enterprise signed an agreement to supply sugar peas to COOP Danmark A/S and Coop Norge A/S. In 2007, the two COOP organisations received their first deliveries and declared themselves highly satisfied with the quality. Another Kenyan company has subsequently started export to a Swedish importer., 487920=After the elections in May, President Blaise Compaor\u00e9 continues to sit comfortably in power for the 20th year in a row., 253468=Danish assistance has contributed to, among other things, 700,000 children in Southern Sudan, especially girls, being able to attend school. Additionally, 200,000 more receive some other form of basic instruction. During the long civil war between the South and the North, education and other areas were neglected by the government officials in the North, and it is estimated that only around 300,000 children in all of Southern Sudan attended school. This was the background for UNICEF, the UN\u2019s Children\u2019s Fund, launching the \u201cGo to School\u201d initiative in Southern Sudan in 2006. A Danish contribution totalling DKK 61 million to phase one of the programme made Denmark one of the largest donors to the initiative. To this must be added the fact that the Danish region of origin support to primary education programmes in Southern Sudan amounted to an additional more than DKK 30 million, which is channelled through Danish and international NGOs that work closely with UNICEF. By the middle of 2007, the international efforts had increased the number of children attending school by around 700,000 so that it passed the one million mark. The programme has continued into 2008 with Danish support amounting to USD 2.2 million., 236253=Danish development assistance has previously been criticised for placing too much focus on stable and secure countries at the expense of fragile or even failed states. The latest criticism came in 2007 from the DAC review of Danish assistance, which also recommended that Denmark should prepare a strategic foundation for its efforts in fragile states., 864559=The Danish Embassies have a duty to report any suspicions of misuse or incorrect management of Danish funds to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 2007 a total of 36 cases were reported to the National Audit Office, involving everything from inadequate financial administration to suspicion of theft or fraud. A number of the report from the embassies and the subsequent investigations have led to the repayment of development funds that have been used improperly., 406458=For a number of years, Denmark has supported the transport sector in Ghana via investments in the road network. A new phase of the sector programme was launched in 2003, with special focus on the road network in rural areas. In order to illustrate the effect of investments in the transport sector, it was decided to construct a so-called Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) for Ghana. This task was assigned to Ghana\u2019s national statistics office -Ghana Statistical Service (GSS). However, the office did not have the necessary capacity, and thus in 2006 an economist from the University of Copenhagen was contacted to provide technical assistance., 70538=UNIFEM, which is the UN\u2019s Development Fund for Women, was established in 1976 in the wake of the first UN Conference on Women, which was held in 1975 in Mexico. UNIFEM\u2019s purpose is to promote women\u2019s human rights and women\u2019s participation in the political process and economic activities. The organisation has a double mandate: to promote gender equality and women\u2019s human rights in the individual Member States as well as working as a catalyst for involving women in development activities in both Member States and in the UN system of development assistance work as a whole., 624495=This was solidly evidenced in December 2007 in connection with the final negotiations regarding the replenishment of the World Bank\u2019s fund for financing interest-free loans and grant aid to the world\u2019s poorest countries, IDA (International Development Association). IDA is the world\u2019s largest single source of donor funds for basic social services to the poorest countries and is therefore a key player in the efforts to ensure these countries reach the Millennium Development Goals., 268649=Back in the year 2000 the UNs Security Council adopted Resolution number 1325 regarding women, peace and security. The resolution was considered a milestone in the efforts to ensure women and children better conflict and post-conflict conditions. However, at the same time it was also clear that the actual significance of the resolution was completely dependent on the political will in the UN system, among the Member States and other relevant actors to live up to the objectives and recommendations of the resolution in the harsh reality of peace negotiations in the midst of wars and conflicts., 304059=Cyclone Sidr caused massive destruction in the coastal areas in Bangladesh in November 2007. In the district of Bagerhat various relief organisations arrived with, among other things, rice, water and clothes for the local people. Photo: StillPictures, 110847=Tying Danish assistance to Danish firms is a classic topic in the assistance debate, and in this context, the report contained both praise and criticism for Denmark. Denmark received praise because since 2003 we have continued the untying process and have now untied almost all assistance. However, there remains a little item of criticism in terms of mixed credits. In 2007 they totalled USD 64.3 million, amounting to three per cent of Denmark\u2019s total assistance. In principle, they are tied to Danish suppliers and this is in conflict with the recommendations of the OECD. And yet Denmark continues to maintain these ties., 517480=In 2007, the growth rate was 6 per cent, and a large proportion of this growth was export-based. Kenya continued its large export of flowers, tea and coffee, and tourism also generated large revenues of foreign currency. In general, several business sectors experienced solid growth in 2007 \u2013 e.g. mobile telephony/IT, tourism and construction. Nairobi in particular experienced a veritable building boom in 2007., 986758=GFATM The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis & Malaria The global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria - diseases of poverty. Fund established in 2000 on the initiative of the Secretary-General of the UN. It collects money for research. http://www.theglobalfund.org/, 972890=A World of Difference Government proposal (June 2003) for political priorities and long-term economic frames for Danish development policy and development efforts 2004-2008. http://www.um.dk/Publikationer/Danida/English/ DanishDevelopmentCooperation/AWorldOfDifference/ AWorldOfDifference.pdf, 870064=The World Health Organisation, WHO, has a predominantly positive reputation for its work in developing countries. That is the general impression from the 2007 MOPAN analysis of WHO., 205040=The IHB since 1994, 259098=In 2004 the leading warlords and politicians signed a peace agreement in Kenya, and for the 14th time since 1991 an attempt was made to get an interim government up and running. It lasted until 2006 when it was overturned by Islamic militias, who were, however, quickly driven out by Ethiopian forces. The Ethiopian forces reinstated the interim government, but it controls far from the entire country. The government does not even maintain control over the capital, Mogadishu., 407525=It was therefore necessary to recalculate the economic key figures, and this led to the surprising conclusion that Ghana\u2019s official GNP was underestimated. The calculations showed that official per capita GNP of USD 400 needed to be written up by more than 90 per cent to USD 758. In one single stroke, Ghana had both come up to the level of oil-rich Nigeria and achieved Millennium Development Goal 1 of halving poverty by 2015., 381513=The pace of development means that there is now the prospect that Benin \u2013 in contrast to Sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 will achieve the Millennium Development Goal of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water. In order to reach the goal, 67 per cent of the rural population must have access to safe drinking water. In 2002, this coverage was 40 per cent. Today, the coverage is almost 50 per cent and if development continues to increase at the same rate, it will be well over 70 per cent by 2015. But it requires that the present efforts are maintained, so that a further three million people gain access to safe drinking water., 769171=5) Falls under Appropriations Act Account 06.39.02. Comprises extraordinary humanitarian assistance, IHB and region-of-origin activities. The account was formerly reported as multilateral assistance, but from and including financial 2005 is reported as bilateral assistance., 278358=Another unfortunate development in 2007 was that the number of refugees rose again after having fallen in recent years. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, the number of refugees in 2007 was just under 10 million, the highest number in four years. The cause of the increase was primarily the very large number of Iraqi refugees who sought shelter in Jordan and Syria, numbering in all more than two million. Because of this, the Danish region of origin initiatives directed at the Iraqi refugee crisis were increased in 2007, while a special focus on Africa, where around 2/3 of the initiatives are conducted, was maintained in Sudan, Somali, Burundi, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Angola and Liberia. Initiatives are also being conducted in Afghanistan with the aim of assisting Afghans who have returned home to reintegrate. It is estimated that at the end of 2007 there were around 25 million internally displaced peopled due to conflicts., 252602=In 2005 Denmark initiated a comprehensive humanitarian and reconstruction programme in Sudan totalling USD 91.9 million, which is to run up to 2009. Half of this amount is to go to humanitarian assistance and region of origin initiatives; the other half is earmarked for reconstruction projects. In 2006 Denmark established a Mission Office in the capital, Khartoum, and in Southern Sudan, Denmark entered into a cooperative effort with five other donors (Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, the United Kingdom and Sweden) and established a joint office that is to promote the Millennium Development Goals through donor harmonisation and capacity building of selected public offices. Moreover, Denmark supports a multi-donor trust fund that is administered by the World Bank. All Danish support to Sudan takes place through international organisations and NGOs., 856914=The Danish contribution to PROAGRI 2 amounts to USD 19.3 million out of Denmark\u2019s total support to the agricultural sector in Mozambique of USD 57.9 million for the 2005-2010 period. The rest of Danish support goes to secondary roads and to developing the private sector in rural districts., 890375=In 2007, five evaluations were completed:, 177841=In 1990 Denmark presented the first CO2 action plan. Since then a number of initiatives have been implemented designed to reduce CO2 emissions. These include, among other things, initiatives that are to promote greater energy efficiency and increase the use of CHP and sustainable energy sources., 214652=In order to enhance Danish efforts at promoting democracy and good governance, a framework agreement between the ombudsman institution and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was entered into in 2001. This agreement ensures a permanent appropriation that enables the institution to make commitments involving international development work and thereby support Denmark\u2019s efforts to promote human rights and democracy. The most recent framework agreement amounts to DKK 2.64 million and covers the period 2007-09. Moreover, the ombudsman can be involved in specific projects through, for example, appropriations from embassies, as has been the case in, among other places, Vietnam and Ghana., 3199=Danida\u0092s Annual Report is divided into several sections: International Development Cooperation: Danish development cooperation in a global perspective. Here the 2007 Annual Report focuses especially on Danish efforts in the area of gender equality., 210341=The former president of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn, shared this interest and he asked the group of Scandinavian and Baltic countries to present a discussion paper on the topic. The paper was ready in the autumn of 2005 when Denmark also seconded an experienced Danish human rights expert to a newly-established position as senior adviser at the Bank\u2019s headquarters., 553969=Education is an important sector for Denmark, and the support is provided in the form of sector budget support and based on constructive dialogue with the government. In 2007, Denmark, for example, contributed to building new schools and financed a school meals scheme that helps keep children in school., 911675=This is how the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u2019 most publicised information campaign in 2007 is described at http://www.dilemma.dk., 1008853=UNFIP United Nations Fund for International Partnerships The fund was created in connection with a donation from Ted Turner in 1997. He wanted to support the UN\u2019s work. In the UNFIP, the UN and the private sector work together. http://www.un.org/partnerships/, 394381=Background: Denmark has supported the road sector in Zambia since 1996, and in 2007 a new phase amounting to DKK 400 million was approved. The new phase continues the principle followed to date in which rehabilitation of main roads goes hand in hand with improvements made to the smaller gravel roads that connect the remote rural areas with Zambia\u2019s main arterial routes. The rehabilitation of smaller gravel roads is to a large extent being carried out by small local construction firms that employ labour-intensive construction methods and provide paid employment to many poor men and women. The finished road also has a lasting effect on the local area\u2019s economy, for example in terms of improving the opportunities to market and sell agricultural products., 174948=In the EU, Denmark has contributed to the preparation of the new strategy for trade and development of the European Community and its Member States. In the WTO, all the donor countries have confirmed that they will provide trade-related assistance to developing countries. During the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in 2005, the EU, Japan and the USA made concrete pledges regarding future assistance in the area of trade. The EU\u2019s pledge will be honoured independent of the result of the Doha Round. Moreover, at the end of 2007 the EU entered into an economic partnership agreement with the ACP countries in order to promote their development, not least of all through increased trade-policy cooperation with the EU and closer economic integration among the six ACP regions., 73969=The increase was not least due to activities financed by a joint fund for gender equality and good governance that UNIFEM in Kenya administers. In 2007 the fund received total contributions of almost USD 10 million and was, therefore, able to carry out a variety of work aimed at promoting women\u2019s participation in the election. The fund supported 35 different NGOs\u2019 work targeting women\u2019s participation in elections and democracy and it supported activities in almost 200 of Kenya\u2019s total of 210 constituencies., 499215=Politically, there were no major upheavals in Egypt in 2007. In spring, 34 articles in the constitution were amended \u2013 the majority of an uncontroversial nature. However, many observers draw attention to the fact that Egypt\u2019s relatively free press and a number of civil society organisations have been subjected to increasing pressure by the authorities. In 2007, the Egyptian authorities would appear to have taken the allegations of police use of torture more seriously. Several police officers were convicted of having used torture during interrogations., 344670=In several respects, Denmark would have wished for a more ambitious action plan. But it was still a plan that all countries could endorse and which, among other things, makes reference to the assessments presented in the latest report of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a basis for a more extensive climate agreement in Copenhagen in 2009., 335671=Since 2003, Denmark has, through its development assistance, supported the creation of projects in developing countries that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions or increase CO2 sequestration. In 2007, approx. USD 3.7 million was used for this purpose. The strategy states that Denmark, as a part of its development assistance, must continue these efforts and assist African countries especially in attracting CDM projects. Denmark has therefore launched a \u201cgreen environment facility\u201d. Here, Denmark will, in collaboration with the UNEP Ris\u00f8 Centre on Energy, Climate and Sustainable Development, initially help six countries to build their capacity to attract and manage CDM projects. These six countries are Mali, Ghana, Niger, Zambia, Burkina Faso and Benin., 604615=In 2007, an evaluation of the EU Action Plan on Climate Change in the Context of Development Cooperation led to a recommendation that the climate change efforts should be intensified. And in 2007, the EU launched the so-called Global Alliance for Climate Change (GCCA), whose task is to strengthen the poorest countries\u2019 efforts to tackle the impact of climate change. The GCCA also provides an opportunity to strengthen the poor countries\u2019 capacity to participate in the global climate change negotiations., 867787=In 2007 MOPAN analyses were performed for the UNDP, WHO and the African Development Bank based on reports from the MOPAN member countries\u2019 embassies in ten developing countries: Bangladesh, Benin, Bolivia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Mali, Nicaragua, Senegal, Serbia and Zambia., 361427=\u00a0poverty line has fallen from 56 per cent in 1992/93 to 38 per cent in 2002/03 and to 31 per cent in 2005/06. Uganda is thus close to achieving its goal of reducing the country\u2019s poverty to 28 per cent by 2013/14. The impressive fall is substantiated by studies that show that the people who still belong to the category of \u201cthe poorest\u201d have experienced improvement in their standard of living in the same period., 755581=All amounts for 2006 and 2007 are calculated in accordance with disbursements reported to DAC. Reported to OECD/DAC as bilateral assistance Reported to OECD/DAC as multilateral assistance, 596898=Since 2005, the number of EU Member States has risen from 15 to 27. Ten Eastern European countries as well as Malta and Cyprus have joined the EU. The majority of them have not previously awarded development assistance, and some, in fact, have formerly been beneficiaries. However, with their entry into the EU, they have all become donors by virtue of Member State contributions to, for example, the development assistance component of the EU budget., 240901=It is on this background that more initiatives will be launched in 2008., 536198=In December, Mozambique bought a share majority in Africa\u2019s second-largest hydropower plant, Cabora Bassa, from the old colonial power, Portugal. The purchase of the hydro-power plants was not least a symbol of true independence from the former colonial power. Economically, it will have great importance for Mozambique, which in the long term will be able to considerably increase revenues from the sale of hydropower. There are also plans to expand the National Electricity Transmission Grid in Mozambique, which at the beginning only supplied electricity to 35 of Mozambique\u2019s 128 district capitals., 238994=Education is a key element of the Danish assistance to Afghanistan. In 2007 Denmark provided USD 9.2 million to the education sector. Education must also be a Danish priority in violence-plagued Helmand Province, and there is definitely enough work to be done. A paltry 3 per cent of the population in the area can read and write, but there is enormous interest in sending children to school. Many people have returned home after having been refugees in Pakistan and Iran where they experienced first hand how much difference it can make to be able to read and write and that education can provide alternative opportunities to the traditional opium farming., 608786=A rising politicisation of the organisation\u2019s work \u2013 driven forward by hefty criticism of the UNDP from parts of the American right wing on the one side and reform-sceptical developing countries on the other \u2013 contributed to making 2007 a difficult year for the UNDP. At the same time, however, the UNDP could be pleased with the several very positive international assessments of its efficiency and effectiveness and of the development results that it contributes to achieving., 484418=In general, the development cooperation with Bolivia in 2007 proceeded more smoothly than for many years, where the cooperation was characterized by many replacements in the public institutions and unclear policies. In order to address this type of problem, Denmark supports a new programme that aims to modernise the public sector \u2013 both in the central administration and in the counties and municipalities., 915485=The first good story was published at http://www.um.dk in April 2007 and is about the agricultural sector in Uganda. Since then, stories from Kenya and Tanzania have been published., 262389=In addition to the assistance in Somalia, Denmark also provides support to Somalis in Kenya through the region of origin initiative. In 2007 this support totalled USD 3.0 million., 631040=UNAIDS: In 2003, UNAIDS launched the initiative \u201cThree Ones\u201d, which is designed to enhance the coordination of HIV/AIDS interventions at country level. The three principles are:, 508682=Corruption remains a major problem in Ghana, although the country improved its ranking in the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index in 2007 by scoring a ranking of 69. Denmark emphasised the importance of continuing the zero tolerance policy during the annual high-level negotiations., 602402=By the time of the WTO deadline of 31 December 2007, new trade agreements had been successfully negotiated with 35 ACP countries. The agreements ensure the respective ACP countries tariff and quota-free market access to the EU for all their goods, with the exception of arms, and transitional arrangements for rice and sugar. With the agreements, the ACP countries are also required to abolish tariffs on goods from the EU. However, the ACP countries will not need to abolish tariffs on a number of EU goods that they fear could out-compete their own production, not least agricultural products. In addition, the abolition of tariffs will in most cases entail long transitional arrangements, up to 15-25 years for certain goods., 546229=When the new government is appointed after the election in April, it is expected that a Nepal Development Forum will be convened to secure donor support for the building up of sustainable institutions that can create the basis for growth and development that benefits all sections of the population in Nepal., 76870=And yet it turned out that the victory had not been won after all. In the autumn of 2007, when the UN\u2019s Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, presented his annual report to the UN\u2019s General Assembly, the new target concerning reproductive healthcare and rights and three other new targets \u2013 despite having been adopted the previous year \u2013 were only mentioned as \u201csuggested\u201d targets., 138499=In 2007 having reached the halfway point to 2015, due to significant economic growth, good progress had been made globally towards halving the number of people living in extreme poverty. However, the progress has been unequally distributed and the majority of the other MDGs are not going to be achieved at the current rate of development. The Danish Government have approved the British Prime Minister\u2019s initiative to convene a UN summit in 2008 whose objective would be to increase the efforts at achieving the Millennium Development Goals., 310809=At the EU level as well, work is being done to improve the coordination of the humanitarian effort. In December 2007 the EU adopted a \u201cEuropean Consensus on Humanitarian Assistance\u201d as a natural extension of the European Consensus on Development from 2005. The goal is to promote interaction between the Member States and the Commission\u2019s efforts and make the EU better able to tackle future challenges in the humanitarian area., 338968=But these are not achieved simply by setting targets. They must also be followed up, and in April 2007 Denmark was host for an international conference that aimed to set focus on the implementation of these plans. The formulation of water resource management and water efficiency plans is moving slowly, but in the right direction. In 2006, 25 per cent of the countries had finalised their national plans, and 50 per cent were well into the process. These countries are now ready to focus on the implementation of the plans. However, there are still 25 per cent of the world\u2019s countries that have not yet begun the formulation process and which continue to need support for the planning., 706933=With the political agreement on the Appropriations Act for 2006, a self-financing requirement was stipulated for the six Danish NGOs that have a so-called framework agreement over the NGO Appropriation, i.e. a multi-annual agreement that is not tied to single projects. The six framework organisations are the Danish Red Cross, DanChurchAid, Save the Children Denmark, the MS Association for International Cooperation, IBIS and CARE Danmark., 52630=Decentralisation was, among other things, the result of a desire to provide Danish embassies with better opportunites for conducting the alignment and harmonisation of development assistance in the individual countries that the 2005 Paris Declaration concerning more assistance encouraged. The harmonisation process has gone faster than most people probably expected. It is possible that the process has gone too quickly in some countries and has, to too high a degree, been driven by big donors and at the request of donors, while the countries involved in the process have found it difficult to keep pace. There is reason, in any case, to stop and consider this possibility., 623480=2007 was a turbulent year for the World Bank, but fortunately it ended on a positive note. Allegations of abuse of position against the American president of the bank, Paul Wolfowitz, reached a climax in May when Wolfowitz resigned as the first president ever to do so in the bank\u2019s 60-year history. His successor was quickly appointed. Even though there was a wish expressed, for example within NGO circles, to break with the tradition that the World Bank Director comes from the USA, the position was again awarded to an American, namely the USA\u2019s former vice-secretary of state, WTO chief negotiator, Robert B. Zoellick, who on 1 June could sit down in the presidential chair., 892636=This is the conclusion of an evaluation study of technical assistance conducted in 2007, which involved studies in such different countries as Mozambique, Vietnam and the Solomon Islands. The evaluation was financed by Denmark, Germany and Australia., 99322=Danish development assistance to Asia \u2013 excluding assistance to the Middle East \u2013 constituted around USD 0.3 billion in 2007 and the nucleus of the assistance was \u2013 and is \u2013 Denmark\u2019s assistance to the four programme countries: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Vietnam. Along with this there is a significant amount of Danish development assistance going to Afghanistan and special environmental assistance going to China, Cambodia, Indonesia and Vietnam., 705963=Nevertheless, Rigsrevisionen, did at the same time express a wish to see a comprehensive action plan for how the Strategy for Danish Support to Civil Society in Developing Countries, published in 2000, is to be implemented in practice. Furthermore, the Ministry should integrate NGO assistance into the overall target and performance management to a greater extent, so that the effect of NGO assistance can be more effectively evaluated in relation to the goals for Danish development assistance., 632147=In the last decade, a number of new global health funds have appeared. The largest and most well known are the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis from 2002, and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI), which was established in 1999 as a private-public partnership with the aim of increasing vaccination efforts in the world\u2019s 75 poorest countries., 543754=On 11 January 2008, the Nepalese government announced that an election for the Constituent Assembly would be held on 10 April 2008. It is important to ensure an inclusive process in the formulation of a new constitution, where all \u2013 including the marginalised groups \u2013 participate. The challenges for the continued peace process will first and foremost be to ensure that the election is implemented and that the results are accepted by the entire Nepalese people. The EU will send a full election mission to observe the election, and Denmark provides economic and technical support to the Election Commission of Nepal., 237958=For example, before the election in December 2007, many saw Kenya as a country in the midst of a stable economic and political development. However, since then, the country has gone through a serious crisis., 534086=2007 was characterised by preparations for the elections to the provincial assemblies, which began so late that the government and the opposition were forced to pass a constitutional amendment that postponed the elections until the end of 2008 at the latest., 379794=Denmark is regarded as a strong, leading and professional partner in the water and sanitation sector in Benin. This was the conclusion of an extensive evaluation in 2007 of Denmark\u2019s support to water and sanitation in Benin and other countries. The evaluation praised especially Denmark for its very active efforts in relation to increased donor harmonisation and for having played a positive and innovative role in the development of sector budget support as well as support to national water resource planning and local capacity building., 848623=The new system was first utilised in 2007 and therefore, there is not yet a report covering an entire year. The preliminary reports indicate, however that, while the three \u2019old\u2019 crosscutting issues \u2013 gender equality, the environment, and democracy and human rights \u2013 have become a more integrated part of development assistance, efforts at integrating HIV/ AIDS are lagging behind., 318682=Indonesia was without doubt the country that was hardest hit by the tsunami on 26 December 2004. The western point of Sumatra was the populated area that was closest to the epicentre of the earthquake that caused the tidal wave which resulted in the death of 130,000 people and made 500,000 people homeless. In the worst-hit province, Aceh, large sections of the population make their living from fishing and agriculture, and almost half of them lost their livelihood at one single stroke., 108850=And as with previous DAC reviews, Danish development assistance received an overwhelming amount of praise in the 100-page-long report, which notes that since the last DAC evaluation in 2003, a number of improvements have occurred. Development assistance has been given its own minister again. The rolling five-year-plans, which were suspended after 2001, have been replaced by the Government\u2019s five-year development policy priorities, so that the recipient countries know in good time the amount of assistance they can expect from Denmark. And the decentralisation that has been carried out since 2003 has made it possible for the Danish embassies in the recipient countries to be more flexible and align Danish assistance better to local conditions and participate in donor harmonisation., 603470=Denmark has engaged in constant efforts to maximise the pro-development dimension of the signed EPAs and has called for ACP countries to be supported in their efforts not only to overcome potential transitional problems that the agreements might cause but also to exploit the opportunities afforded by the agreements to differentiate the trade and thus enable many developing countries to escape their dependence on very few export goods. Denmark will continue to make its position heard when the negotiations between the EU and the ACP countries resume in 2008 with the aim of creating proper EPAs that must apply at regional level and encompass more than trade in goods., 963145=The scheme involving Mixed Credits for developing countries was established in 1993. A mixed credit is a loan on terms like those of an export credit, whereby Danida pays most or all of the interest. The credit can finance Danish project supplies to development projects in creditworthy developing countries with a GNI per capita of a maximum of USD 2,380. The scheme was primarily established with a view to financing development projects in countries of interest to Danish trade and industry., 595764=Coherence or interconnection is a key Danish priority in the EU. Coherence entails that there must be interconnection between the EU\u2019s development policy goals and the policy pursued in other areas, such as trade, agriculture, migration and climate change. Over the years, the EU has established different procedures for monitoring coherence. In 2007, the EU presented an extensive report on coherence between development policy and other policies, at both national and EU level. It showed that the EU, despite the monitoring and consultation mechanisms that had been introduced, still has considerable work ahead of it to ensure that EU policies that have an impact on developing countries are not conflicting. The report identified 12 policy areas, such as trade, environment, migration and agriculture, where development policy should be integrated further. Interestingly enough, the report also showed that the EU has actually has made more progress in ensuring coherence than the majority of Member States have achieved at national level., 859043=In 2007 alone the \u2019flying squad\u2019 visited the embassies in Ghana, Nicaragua, Bangladesh and Zambia, which are among Denmark\u2019s programme countries. Moreover, visits were also made to the Missions in Indonesia and Cambodia., 566024=Uganda has begun to reap the fruits of the peace negotiations. In 2007, the country experienced increased GNP growth of 6.2 per cent., 468329=In 2008, Denmark expects to launch a new programme for good governance and general budget support, which was approved in November 2007., 369746=The Danish support to education in Nepal amounts to USD 36.7 million in the period 2004-2009., 279955=The fund channelled USD 164 million to long-lasting and forgotten crises in 2007 and thus contributed not only to enhancing the efforts but also to improved coordination of the initiatives and a stronger role for the UN\u2019s humanitarian coordinator. The fund has also helped in ensuring that the positive development of meeting the UN\u2019s appeals has continued over recent years. The degree of financing has gradually risen from 55 per cent in 2005, to 63 per cent in 2006 and 66 per cent in 2007., 413901=This was one of the reasons that Altifibers initiated a partnership in 2005 with the Danish design firms, Aymara and Creme de la Creme de la Edgar, with the help of support from the B2B Programme. The collaboration has resulted in the development of an exclusive design line called Aymara, producing fashion clothes for the Danish, Scandinavian and later the rest of the European market., 909200=When seeking grant funding for a development project, Danish NGOs can also apply for grants for information activities about the project. In 2006, USD 2.4 million was awarded for the project-related information activities of NGOs., 251876=Sudan is not a weak state in the traditional sense. Government authority, which is dominated by people from Northern Sudan, is actually quite strong, and the country has large earnings from oil and other natural resources. However, the many internally displaced people in Sudan and the refugees in the neighbouring countries are in need of humanitarian assistance. Assistance is also needed to consolidate the peace accord that was agreed to between the North and the South in 2005, and there is especially a need for reconstruction assistance that can help to ensure that the country\u2019s resources also reach the large population groups in the many marginalised areas in Southern Sudan, Darfur and Eastern Sudan., 640627=It aroused attention in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark when the Scandinavian journal \u201cDevelopment Today\u201d in June 2007 published an article that concluded that Denmark lags behind the other Nordic countries when it comes to top posts in the UN system. Of 24 top posts occupied by Scandinavians, Sweden had ten, Norway seven, Finland five, whilst Denmark had to make do with two \u2013 although these were two key positions in countries that are the focus of considerable international attention, namely East Timor and Cyprus., 484841=In the agricultural sector, Denmark has with great success provided support towards improving the cultivation methods of smallholder farmers and to the processing and marketing of their products. For example, small-scale production sites and dairies have been established with the help of local producer organisations. Support also played a role in ensuring that the income of farmers rose by 11 per cent in 2007 in areas where the Danish support is provided., 585406=In May, an English court convicted the former president, Chiluba, of large-scale corruption and ordered him to pay up to USD 40 million back to the Zambian government. The judgment is historic and sends a strong message of warning, because it is the first time that a contemporary African leader has been convicted of large-scale corruption. The corresponding case at the Zambian court has, however, yet to be concluded., 580030=In 2007, the government became aware in earnest of the importance of focusing on climate issues in the country, which has a very long coastline and which is estimated to be the fifth most vulnerable country in the world in relation to climate change. In 2007, with Denmark\u2019s support, work began on establishing a national target programme to address climate change., 271136=Denmark has supported mine-clearing activities in various poor countries with more than DKK one billion since 1992. On average, Denmark provides approximately DKK 80 million annually, thus placing Denmark among the world\u2019s ten largest donors in the area., 482878=Bolivia continues to experience economic growth and show a surplus on state finances, and in 2007 an economic growth of 3.8 per cent was reached. This was due not least to the increased export of natural gas and rising prices on the international market. In 2006, the government succeeded in renegotiating a number of contracts with the foreign enterprises responsible for natural gas extraction, the result of which was a considerable rise in the tax and duty levied on gas extraction. In 2007, this led to a substantial increase in fund transfers to the municipalities. The increased revenues have thus already begun to contribute considerably to Bolivia\u2019s economic and social development., 599452=The second summit at head of state and government level between the EU and Africa took place on 8-9 December 2007 in Lisbon. Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen and Danish Minister for Development Cooperation Ulla T\u00f8rn\u00e6s both attended the summit. In the many speeches given at the meeting, it was underlined that relations between the EU and Africa had entered a new era. The positive developments in Africa were highlighted, and it was stated that a paradigm shift had occurred in the relations between the EU and Africa and a new partnership between equal continents., 42545=The key word for the new role of the donors is \u2019partnership\u2019, which also provided the name for the Danish strategy from 2000. The changes have eliminated some of the problems of the past, but have not \u2013 yet \u2013 created an equal partnership between the provider and the receiver, nor have they \u2013 despite the change of wording \u2013 removed the conditions set by the donor countries in order for countries to receive assistance, the \u2019conditionalities\u2019., 457525=Despite the chaotic conditions, Bangladesh achieved a growth of 6.7 per cent in 2007. This is due primarily to the private sector., 357615=Universal primary education for all children in the world by 2015 - this is Goal 2 of the eight Millennium Development Goals. If they are to be reached, more money is needed, considerably more money. Therefore, the World Bank and a number of other donors and developing countries took the initiative in 2002 to establish a new global partnership, the Fast-Track Initiative (FTI)., 396733=In 2006, it was decided to conduct a joint evaluation of PROAGRI\u2019s first phase from 1999 to 2005. It was completed in 2007 and concluded that the majority of the preset goals had been achieved: The Ministry of Agriculture had been strengthened both centrally and locally, and it had contributed to the decentralisation in the sector. Success had been achieved in improving the coordination between the Ministry of Agriculture and the many donors by bringing together the previously countless number of single projects under one umbrella. The fragmentation that previously characterised the agricultural sector has been replaced by a common vision for how agricultural development should take place., 140105=In 2007 Danish development assistance rose by USD 110.2 million in relation to 2006, and development assistance thus totalled USD 2.6 billion. This increase was due to the fact that growth in the Danish economy resulted in a greater GNI for 2007. Thus, the total development assistance also increased., 601356=Throughout 2007, there were intense negotiations regarding trade agreements between the EU and the ACP countries, which comprise 78 countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific region. At the end of 2007, the existing trade arrangement in the Cotonou Agreement expired and with it the WTO exception that has ensured ACP countries differential and more favourable access to the EU market. The WTO rules require that trade agreements are mutually binding. This means that ACP countries must open their markets to EU goods, as the EU has already opened its market for goods from ACP countries., 577833=Corruption remains a major problem in Vietnam, which lies number 123 on the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index. In 2005, a rather far-reaching anti-corruption law was passed, and corruption today is no longer a taboo issue. Officials and ministers speak openly about it, and it was a major theme in the election campaign in the runup to the parliamentary election. Together with other donors, Denmark contributes to strengthening an inspectorate system that is responsible for enforcing the law on anti-corruption., 176999=All countries have a responsibility to contribute to achieving Goal 7 concerning ensuring environmentally-friendly and sustainable development, and in this area Denmark has contributed to the objective by making its energy consumption more efficient. In the period from 1990 to 2006 the energy consumption share percentage of Denmark\u2019s GNP was reduced by approximately 26 per cent, making Denmark one of the most energy efficient countries in the world., 263425=The Danish support was provided as a part of the Africa Programme for Peace, which was adopted to run for the period from 2004 to 2009 in order to support peace and stability in Africa with USD 45.6 million through four organisations., 407116=The consequences of the Ghana Statistical Service\u2019s longstanding lack of adequate resources became quickly apparent to the economist. It has meant, among other things, that the existing data material is outdated and that a number of key national accounting figures are no longer calculated. Since 1999, the GSS has not published official figures for Ghana\u2019s gross national product (GNP)!, 137400=At the beginning of the new millennium, the UN\u2019s 191 Member States reached agreement on the Millennium Declaration, which includes eight clear and ambitious development goals for the period up to 2015. The world thereby agreed on a joint development policy agenda and a cohesive vision for the primary goal of reducing poverty and its causes., 143939=One of the results of the consistent Danish pressure is that the EU countries have committed themselves to increasing development assistance such that the EU as a whole will reach 0.56 per cent of GNI in 2010 \u2013 an increase of more than EUR 20 billion a year. Moreover, the original 15 EU Member States are individually to reach 0.7 per cent by 2015. At least half of the collective increase in development assistance will go to Sub-Saharan Africa., 551872=The new government continues the previous government\u2019s economic line, which prioritises open markets and cooperation with the IMF. Daniel Ortega fought the election on the promise of a zero hunger programme and has a clear focus on the poor. Initiatives such as free education and free healthcare began to emerge in 2007., 125985=In reality the Millennium Development Goals, which were approved by 189 heads of state at the historic UN Summit Meeting in September 2000, were \u2019just\u2019 a bringing together of the goals that the international community had already committed to in declarations from various previous summits. However, the adoption of the Millennium Declaration and the eight primary Millennium Development Goals marked an historic turning point that has had enormous impact for several reasons., 395724=In 1992, decades of civil war ended in Mozambique, which at that time was one of the world\u2019s absolutely poorest countries. A total of 80 per cent of the population lived in rural areas, the vast majority as poor subsistence farmers, despite the fact that the country is rich in diverse natural resources., 502990=Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is increasingly becoming an integral element of B2B partnerships. In this connection, support was awarded in 2007 to numerous improvements of both the outdoor and indoor work environment, such as investments in water treatment installations, drinking water installations and solar energy installations., 553572=In connection with the Danish-Nicaraguan high-level negotiations in June 2007, it was decided that the Danish assistance should be concentrated in fewer sectors, but within an unchanged financial framework. The aim is by 2010 to channel the Danish assistance through four programmes that support education, rural district development, public sector reforms and business sector development., 608079=The stand was set up in the exhibition area \u201cDevelopment Village\u201d, where 79 different exhibitors competed for attention from the over 2000 participants, all of whom had specialised knowledge and experience within the field of climate change and development cooperation., 352672=In this respect, the Danish Minister for Development Cooperation, Ulla T\u00f8rn\u00e6s, gained a first-hand impression of poaching when she visited Zambia in March 2007. Shortly before she arrived in Lower Zambezi in order to visit CLZ, the park rangers had discovered three elephants that poachers had shot and sawn the tusks off., 134603=Epidemics of tuberculosis seem to be finally on the decline, though not quickly enough for us to be able to halve the percentage of deaths from TB by 2015., 481879=In 2006, a Constituent Assembly was elected for the purpose of drafting a new constitution that can promote broader political participation in Bolivia and ensure that the indigenous population feels more represented., 610863=For the UNDP and the UN system, the most important issue in 2007, however, was the continued efforts to reform the UN system and coordinate the UN\u2019s overall efforts at country level based on the recommendations set out in the UN report from 2006, \u201cDelivering as One\u201d. The UN General Assembly has not really succeeded in speeding up the reform process, but after difficult negotiations in the UNDP Executive Board a compromise was reached for how the UNDP can contribute to the reform process. This happened with the adoption of the UNDP Strategy Plan 2008-11., 473272=Fundamental principles and electoral law governing the parties that stand for election to the National Assembly (lower house) on 24 March 2008 have been formulated. Among other things, the parties may not be based on religion, ethnicity, gender or regions. Two parties have been approved, and the names of a total of 94 candidates have been put forward, ten of them women, to the 47 seats in the National Assembly., 343253=Denmark was also co-organiser of a seminar on 1 November at Columbia University in New York, which placed focus on the new challenges that climate change had created for the efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. The Director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University and former Special Adviser to the UN Secretary General on the Millennium Development Goals, Jeffrey Sachs, was keynote speaker. He emphasised once more in a persuasive manner that climate change is most serious for the developing countries and can be a serious obstacle to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, which the international community committed itself to in 2000., 149785=In recent years there has been a clear desire on the part of the Government to strengthen the public anchoring and self-financing among, especially, the NGOs that have entered into framework agreements with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In connection with the adoption of the Appropriations Act for 2006, the Government therefore introduced a requirement regarding self-financing for the six framework organisations. These organisations were required to raise private funding in Denmark amounting to at least five per cent of the framework allocation they received from the Ministry. From 2007 this figure was raised to 10 per cent. The intention of this initiative has been to promote Danish NGOs\u2019 incentive to engage new private actors in order to enhance their public anchoring as well as to make the NGOs more responsible to their members and to private contributors. In both 2006 and 2007 all six framework organisations met the self-financing requirement., 513939=The outcome of the presidential and parliamentary elections on 27 December was decided amid allegations of fraud, and only a few days later Kenya was thrown into a serious political and security crisis., 604241=In the global climate change negotiations, the EU plays an active role as bridge builder between the very sceptical countries, like the USA, and the developing countries. This was clearly evident during the UN\u2019s 13th Climate Change Conference in Bali in December 2007, when it was only by a hair\u2019s breadth that an agreement was successfully negotiated., 70225=Apart from the media and gender equality issues, Denmark supports democracy, decentralisation and human rights in Yemen through the \u2019Yemeni-Danish Partnership Programme\u2019, which was signed by Yemen\u2019s Government in December, 2004., 264590=The IGAD was formed in 1986 in connection with a drought disaster and originally consisted of Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Sudan and Somalia. These are countries that are characterised by both internal and mutual conflicts, and the organisation was inactive from 1994 to 1996. From that point on, however, it was revived by the member countries in an attempt to put an end to the conflicts in the region and initiate regional cooperative projects involving, i.a., environmental cooperation, food safety and infrastructure. Since that time, however, Eritrea has left the IGAD., 712065=But that does not mean the work is finished. The Convention must be signed and ratified by 20 countries before entering into force. By the end of 2007, 15 countries had ratified the Convention, whereas 123 countries \u2013 including Denmark \u2013 have signed, but not yet ratified it. Once the Convention enters into force, it will be used as a platform for improving conditions for disabled people in the particular countries., 499826=Economically, Egypt performed excellently in 2007, which saw real growth of 7 per cent, rapidly increasing foreign investments, increases in exports and the current reserves, as well as a positive balance of payments. At the same time, inflation was kept under control., 528622=The two programmes dedicate strong focus to improving the position of women, and the gender equality aspect permeates all Danish development cooperation currently under preparation in Mali. In this regard, in connection with the presidential and parliamentary elections in 2007, Denmark supported a massive information campaign directed at women. The campaign sought to encourage women to stand as candidates in the parliamentary elections and to encourage women to participate actively by voting on election day., 733338=*The Project Advice and Training Centre is a union of small NGOs in Denmark. Since 1996, the Centre\u2019s secretariat in Aarhus has received support from Danida for, among other things, running courses, advising inexperienced NGOs and especially for administering the Mini-Project Fund, which processes all NGO applications under USD 0.6 million., 205098=In 1994 a broad majority in the Folketing (Danish Parliament)et, approved the establishment of the International Humanitarian Service, IHB, with the stated purpose of contributing to conflict prevention and assisting to ensure peace and stability., 901690=With the aim of enhancing the dialogue between research and assistance, research networks are supported. In 2007, the number of supported networks was reduced from six to three, in that the support to the Network for Smallholder Poultry Development has been phased out and the networks for farming, environment and good governance have been collected in the Danish Development Research Network. In addition, the Danish Water Forum\u2019s Knowledge Network for Water and Development and the Danish Network for International Health Research are granted support., 1005154=Security, Growth - Development The Government\u2019s development policy plan for Danish development assistance 2005-2009. http://www.um.dk/Publikationer/Danida/English/ DanishDevelopmentCooperation/security_growth_development/ strength_growth_development.pdf, 315813=Solely in order for the poor countries to adapt to the climate change, the UNDP estimates that USD 86 billion annually will be required in development assistance. According to the UNDP, this is, on the one hand, a modest amount, referring to the fact that this figure \u201conly\u201d corresponds to 0.2 per cent of the gross national product (GNP) of OECD countries and that the UK in 2004-2005 spent USD 1.4 billion alone on flood management and coastal erosion., 208901=Among the participants at the seminar were more than 40 members of the Vietnamese Parliament, and there was significant interest in developing a more efficient body for managing complaints. This does not mean that Vietnam immediately intends to create an ombudsman institution like Denmark\u2019s, but inspiration from Denmark can be used to make Vietnam\u2019s complaints body more efficient and powerful. Continuing work in this area is being supported by Denmark as a part of the unified programme for support to good governance in Vietnam. The programme was approved in 2007 and was allocated a total of USD 12.9 million for the 2008-11 period., 3476=Danish development assistance: Concrete bilateral and multilateral development assistance activities in 2006, with a review of the development in Denmark\u0092s programme countries., 330658=Therefore, the Bolivian government has created 22 national parks, which together cover 15 per cent of the country. In 2007, Denmark decided to contribute to the work with support to the national park authorities and four national parks in the highland area in the poorest part of Bolivia. If it had not been for the Danish support, these four parks would have been national parks in name but not in nature., 229958=Burma has been a Danish priority for many years, and the important thing is to be there when trouble occurs and make the junta aware of the fact that Denmark is keeping an eye on developments in the country. The active Danish line was confirmed in 2006 with a new initiative that makes it possible to work around the regime in Burma. Previously Denmark had concentrated its efforts in Burma on the approximately 1 million refugees living in the border area to Thailand. The new initiative allows for Denmark also to provide support to the approximately 52 million people living in Burma., 147183=The issues relating to debt continue to be a challenge for developing countries. It has therefore been feared that the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative would not be sufficient to bring the debt in developing countries down to a manageable level. It was on this basis that the G8 Countries decided at their High Level meeting in Gleneagles in 2005 to cancel the HIPC\u2019s debt to the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the African Development Bank. A precondition for this debt cancellation was that the countries had completed the HIPC Process. In order to ensure that the development banks continue to be able to provide loans to developing countries on extremely favourable conditions, it is necessary that bilateral donors assist with the financing. Traditionally, Denmark has supported debt-relief initiatives and has borne its share of the expenses as a part of an international agreement., 288681=Humanitarian assistance consists of the sum of the humanitarian assistance that is reported as bilateral (Appropriations Act, Section 06.39.02) and the humanitarian assistance that is reported as multilateral (Appropriations Act, Section 06.39.01., 85799=Efforts aimed at creating jobs for the many young people living in the continent are to be increased. This will both ensure growth and reduce poverty, but it will also reduce the risk of hopelessness, radicalisation and conflict. Growth and employment specifically are key themes of the Africa Commission, which was established through Danish Government legislation in 2007 and in 2009 is to present recommendations for how to improve the effectiveness of international development cooperation., 287716=Also further south, in Mozambique, there was flooding and up to 300,000 people were affected by the violent downpours which, among other things, caused the Zambezi River to rise. Mozambique\u2019s government reacted to the disaster both quickly and efficiently. Since the great floods in 2000 and again in 2001, the country has established a better disaster response system, which makes it possible to predict disasters earlier and respond to them more effectively. This has been done with, i.a. Danish support. Lessons learned meant that in 2007 many people were relocated in time and a temporary centre was quickly set up for those affected by the flooding. Through the Danish Red Cross, Denmark provided USD 137,802 to the victims., 975455=ASEAN Association of South East Asian Nations A cooperation organisation created in 1967 by a number of Southeast Asian countries. The organisation works to promote economic, social and cultural growth in the region and to secure peace. http://www.aseansec.org, 429274=The gearing rate is lower than in 2006, when it was 2.5. The lower gearing rate in 2007 is due primarily to the fact that a final commitment was given for an untied wind energy project in Egypt, in which the contract was awarded to a Spanish enterprise., 597540=In 2005, the old 15 EU Member States committed themselves to reaching the UN goal of providing 0.7 per cent of their GNI in development assistance by 2015. At the same time, the new EU Member States committed themselves to providing 0.17 per cent by 2010 and 0.33 per cent by 2015. The rise cannot and must not only be achieved by new EU Member States\u2019 contributions to EU development activities. The Member States must also act as donors themselves, and some of them are in the process of building up a system for administering development assistance., 576692=Vietnam is a country undergoing rapid change, and a number of events in 2007 contributed to the change processes also in the political sphere. Vietnam became a member of the WTO in January 2007, which, among other things, entails an obligation to ensure a level playing field between state-owned and private companies and to establish an arbitration system that conforms to international standards. In the parliamentary election in May 2007, there was more lively debate than earlier, and several of the candidates that the party had nominated did not win election. Vietnam has been elected to the UN Security Council for 2008-09, which means that the country\u2019s compliance with UN conventions, for example, in the human rights field, will come under increased scrutiny., 518217=The national poverty reduction strategy - Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment Creation (ERS) \u2013 expired in 2007, and was replaced in 2008 by Vision 2030. It is the assessment that ERS has delivered the goods in relation to economic growth, job creation and, to a certain extent, poverty reduction. The number of Kenyans living below the poverty line fell from over 55 per cent in 2002 to 46 per cent in 2007., 630576=WHO: WHO has established a new department whose principal task is to work on strengthening national health systems in developing countries and the provision of basic healthcare. The health systems have been put under extra pressure not only by the HIV/ AIDS epidemic, but also by the many different donors operating in the field. WHO\u2019s work on strengthening national health systems will receive USD 3.7 million in the years 2007-10., 447986=This combination led a new tea factory in Buhweju in south-western Uganda with an annual tea production capacity of 1,620 tonnes to be prepared and screened as a mixed credit project in 2007. The overall project is expected to cost up to almost USD 4.2 million. Danida will provide approx. USD 1.8 million in support towards covering interest costs, etc. The factory is planned to be ready in 2010., 419748=It requires a highly targeted effort, and this is what DIPP (Danish Import Promotion Programme) provides. In 2007, DIPP carried out a special promotion drive in Uganda, a Targeted Marketing Campaign, in collaboration with a local organisation for female entrepreneurs comprising approx. 800 members. As part of the campaign, DIPP held a workshop in Kampala with the theme, \u2019export of art crafts\u2019. Around 30 women participated and were trained in the basic skills of running a business, product development, marketing, freight and the opportunities on the European market. This led to contact with women who made necklaces in BIDWA. These necklaces are now in the process of being Fair Trade Certified and contact has been established with an importer of Fair Trade products., 4182=Just like last year, Program- og Projektorienteringen (PPOen) is available online (in Danish) at www.netpublikationer.dk/um/8838/. It contains targets, results and status for all ongoing, approved bilateral and multilateral programme and projects, humanitarian cases and NGO projects as of the end of 2007., 464456=In 2006, Benin held presidential elections in which a new president was elected by an overwhelming majority on an agenda of good governance and a showdown with corruption. At the parliamentary elections in 2007, the parties behind the president secured a modest majority. The government acknowledges that extensive reforms of the public sector are absolutely crucial for implementing the programmes that are incorporated into the government\u2019s ambitious strategy for growth and poverty reduction., 259583=In the spring of 2007 another attempt was made to reunite the many conflicting parties at a reconciliation conference with the participation of representatives from a broad range of the Somali population. The conference, which was financed by Denmark, among others, did not lead to an actual peace agreement, but it did result in reduced fighting for a short time and many of the goals that were set at the conference have been reached. For instance, the unpopular prime minister has been replaced by Nur Adde, who is more respected. He has also replaced a number of other ministers with more qualified people who are not tarnished by the many years of internal conflict. Many of them are well-educated representatives of Somalia\u2019s enormous diaspora., 243068=In December 2007 the Ministries of Defence and Foreign Affairs produced a joint plan for Danish activities in the province. The plan sets very specific goals and clear guidelines for the civilian-military cooperation., 230956=The sanctions are run through the EU, where Denmark actively presses to strengthen the sanctions. As a result of, i.a., active Danish efforts, the EU\u2019s Foreign Ministers voted in 2007 to tighten the sanctions that are directed against sectors that are significant to the generals economically, specifically lumber, minerals, metals and gems. Despite strong pressure from Denmark, it was not, however, possible to get the other EU countries to agree to apply the sanctions to oil and gas as well. At the same time, the EU\u2019s Foreign Ministers decided to increase the humanitarian assistance to the Burmese civilian population., 373075=At the end of June 2007, 38 per cent of the population was registered in the scheme and 32 per cent had progressed so far that they had been issued with an insurance card. However, much suggests that wealthier Ghanaians are registering into the system to a greater degree than the poor., 1002413=Partnership 2000 Strategy for Danish development assistance. Adopted by the Danish Parliament in autumn 2000. http://www.um.dk/NR/rdonlyres/8C1E6A52-3F33-49D4-9302- 3BE1C2A5F3AF/0/denmarks_development_policy_strategi.pdf, 180177=In the Appropriations Act for 2007, the Government allocated over half a billion more in additional development assistance compared to the Appropriations Act for 2006. Greater international responsibility also follows with the increasing level of Danish development assistance. The Government will take action where the need is greatest. In this regard, the challenges of sustainable development are far and away greatest in Africa, which is therefore at the heart of the Government\u2019s development policy priorities. The Government will increase assistance to Africa in the coming years \u2013 which will take place through a long-term effort aimed at supporting the African countries\u2019 own determination to combat poverty and secure a better future for themselves. Furthermore, Denmark will strengthen its involvement in relation to the Arab world. The focal point of the Government\u2019s development policy will be to contribute actively to the fulfilment of the UN\u2019s Millennium Development Goals., 866385=In 2004 Denmark adopted a comprehensive action plan against corruption based on the principle of zero tolerance. The plan has been followed up by in-service training of all staff at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the embassies that work with development assistance and by information material for the public and cooperation partners in all programme countries., 183544=At the end of 2006, Nepal\u2019s Government and the Maoists signed a peace agreement, formally ending more than 10 years of violent conflict. The country now finds itself in a positive but challenging situation that, with international support, has the possibility of leading to peace, democracy and stability. A successful resolution to the peace process can pave the way for sustainable growth, development and poverty reduction., 304878=And yet it could have been much worse. When a similar disaster hit Bangladesh in 1991, approximately 140,000 people died and in 1970 more than half a million people lost their lives. The explanation lies partly in the fact that Bangladesh has become better at predicting these types of disasters and preventing the consequences, and partly in the fact that the international community \u2013 in cooperation with Bangladesh \u2013 has become better at providing swift and coordinated aid when such disasters strike. And finally, the centre of the cyclone hit one of the world\u2019s largest areas of mangroves., 757451=*) Calculated in accordance with disbursements under Section 06.3 and Section 06.11.19 (Neighbourhood Programme). Disbursements incl. debt relief., 641577=And already in October 2007, a Dane was appointed to a major UN top post, when the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon announced that he would appoint Danish Ambassador Ellen Margrethe L\u00f8j as his Special Representative for Liberia and thus the executive head of all the activities of the UN system in the country. The activities that Ellen Margrethe L\u00f8j would be in overall charge of from 1 January 2008 encompassed both a peacekeeping operation of 15,000 men and the UN\u2019s contribution to the efforts to rebuild Liberia after many years of civil war. In this way, she became the highest-placed Dane in the UN system., 231937=In the autumn of 2007, Denmark decided to increase assistance to Burma by an additional USD 9.2 million for the period 2007-2008. Denmark\u2019s assistance is to continue to go to the Burmese exile community and refugees and to the Burmese population. Danish assistance targets, i.a., education, combating malnutrition in children, HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, as well as providing support to the development of a civil society and to strengthening the media internally in Burma., 889687=Lastly, in 2007, a follow-up was conducted on the evaluation from 2002 of Danish support to vocational training programmes in 23 countries to see whether the recommendations have been implemented. The study encompassed visits to Kenya and Zambia and concludes that a number of recommendations have been followed and are still used in the current work. However, it should be added that this is not due solely to the evaluation, but also the general tendencies in development assistance., 128308=At the end of 2007, half of the time had gone that the world community had set as the deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals. So, how has it gone up until now? This is something that the annual reports from the Secretary General of the UN and the World Bank tell us a great deal about., 340137=It began in Nairobi, Kenya in November 2006. At the UN Climate Change Conference, the Danish Minister for the Environment, Connie Hedegaard, put Denmark\u2019s name forward as host country and Copenhagen as host city for the 15th Conference of the Parties behind the UN Climate Change Agreement from 1992, the so-called COP 15, which is due to be held in December 2009., 483642=The government has strengthened cooperation with the donors and takes the Paris Declaration seriously. In this regard, the government issued a decree in 2007 in which it was stated that development assistance was to be aligned with Bolivia\u2019s national policies and structures. The great challenge that needs to be overcome, however, is that the capacity of the administration to carry out the good intentions remains low., 457663=The great concern is inflation, which in 2007 was over 10 per cent. Also rises in food prices of over 11 per cent have affected very large sections of the population. The textile sector is the locomotive that is keeping Bangladesh going, with the sector accounting for 75 per cent of exports., 91415=The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in collaboration with invited Danish and international experts, prepared a thorough analysis, but it served only as the solid, academic foundation for the public debate that began in spring 2007. The debate led to the first draft and the final strategy, which was launched in August 2007., 410918=In 2007 alone, USD 8.3 million was awarded under the PPP Programme, and interest in the programme is rapidly increasing. 12 projects in all received support in 2007, with an increasing number of them being implemented in Africa. Denmark continues to work at enhancing the programme\u2019s focus on Africa., 546036=Denmark has granted USD 9.2 million in support to the peace process in Nepal. Of this amount, USD 4.6 million was spent in 2007 on supporting the preparations for the upcoming election., 278080=Unfortunately, many of the long-lasting conflicts continued in 2007. This applied to, among others, the conflicts in Darfur in Sudan, Somalia and the Democratic Republic Congo, all conflicts that are having a destabilising effect on their neighbouring countries as well., 525685=Mali held presidential elections in April and parliamentary elections in July. The country has already begun preparations for municipal elections in 2009, which will be an important event, as Mali has an extensive system of decentralisation out to the municipalities. However, there is still a huge need for resources and capacity building in the municipalities before the decentralisation becomes properly embedded., 579024=The privatisation process is fully underway, and it is the private sector that drives the economic growth. Even though the investment climate could be better, foreign enterprises invested USD 16 billion in the country in 2007. The private sector\u2019s contribution to export has risen and in 2007 accounted for 75 per cent compared with 35 per cent in 1997. Particularly in urban areas, rapid industrialisation is taking place within fields such as the textile, metal, food, furniture and shipbuilding industries as well as within the IT sector., 571196=Denmark pursues a balanced poverty-oriented development strategy in Uganda, in which focus is directed at economic growth in the private sector \u2013 particularly agriculture \u2013 and support to social welfare development within healthcare, water supply and sanitation. Similarly, good governance and respect for human rights are key areas. Despite the conflict in northern Uganda, Denmark implemented a number of reconstruction activities in 2007, which include, among other things, the rebuilding of roads and hospitals., 51379=The new strategies thus put into practice the thoughts outlined in the Globalisation Strategy from 2006, which laid down that Denmark must play an active role in globalisation, have a presence in the hot spots throughout the world, make a positive difference, and help to ensure that globalisation benefits everyone, including the poor., 347101=Danida has supported the Burkinian energy sector since 1973, but this is now coming to an end. The present energy sector programme amounting to USD 66.1 million was approved in 1999. Of this amount, USD 4.0 million has been allocated to sustainable forest operations. In consultation with the Burkinian government, it has been decided to phase out the Danish support to the energy sector. This will take place over a period of three years, comprising a total grant of USD 7.7 million. Of this grant, USD 2.8 million will go to sustainable forestry., 219789=The efforts of the centres have led to concrete results: from the start in 2000 and up until 2007 more than 4,000 victims of violence had received help, and 1,278 cases had been reported, leading to 121 convictions. But the preventative role of the centres is just as important. They cooperate with NGOs, the media and government officials in order to make people aware of the rights of women and girls and to prevent violence against women and girls., 458691=During 2007, the formulation of a joint strategy for development assistance was firmly put on the agenda in Bangladesh. Denmark\u2019s support is provided within the framework of the country\u2019s national poverty reduction strategy, and Denmark also contributes through a joint donor initiative to increase harmonisation and alignment of development assistance., 420775=The success of DIPP\u2019s campaigns is evidenced by a corresponding campaign in 2006. Here, the objective was to market fresh fruit and vegetables from East Africa to Denmark. In collaboration with a regional organisation for businesswomen, DIPP selected six enterprises from Uganda and Kenya, all owned by women., 76156=Thoraya Ahmed Obaid has been executive director of the UNFPA since 2001 and is an unusual spokesperson for reproductive healthcare. She is the first Saudi Arabian to lead a UN organisation; she is a woman; and, in 1963, she was also the first Saudi Arabian woman to receive a scholarship to study in the USA., 5327=Version/edition: 13-10-2008, 412097=For example, in 2007 the Danish company, Eurotex, and the Indian textile company, Sree Santhosh Garments (SSG), received support from the PPP Programme to, for example, establish a training centre where poor Indians aged 15-18 could receive training in textile processing with a view to taking up later employment in SSG. Other local textile companies have also shown interest in employing trainees from the training centre., 621579=The UNEP\u2019s effectiveness has for a number of years suffered under the external weaknesses that the UN reform is seeking to address as well as internal weaknesses. In 2006, Achim Steiner from Germany was appointed the new Executive Director to replace Klaus T\u00f6pfer, who had occupied the position since 1998. Steiner has injected further impetus into the internal reform process, which aims to create a more focused, efficient and results-seeking organisation., 2349=Title: DANIDA\u0092S ANNUAL REPORT 2007, 769471=6) The Neighbourhood Programme Section 06.11.19. Only the disbursements that can be included as ODA in accordance with the DAC directive., 266438=It is often difficult to document the effect of development assistance in concrete figures. But that is not the case with the years of Danish support that have gone to mine clearing in Nicaragua. This work began in 1997 and was completed in 2007. In total, Denmark has contributed USD 12.5 million to mine clearing and is by far the largest and most consistent donor in this area., 257180=The UN\u2019s Population Fund, UNFPA, is supporting the preparations for the census that is planned to start on 22 April 2008 and last two weeks. The support includes counselling and technical assistance to the authorities, but also to a high degree information for the citizens through NGOs. Many people, especially those in the refugee camps, are extremely sceptical regarding public officials and allowing themselves to be registered, and a successful census requires, therefore, a solid information campaign. Denmark is providing support to the census through the UNFPA amounting to USD 7.1 million., 370751=The scheme was adopted in 2003 and properly entered into force in 2005. Before then, Ghanaians had to pay cash for the particular healthcare service and for medicine, and even though the payment was relatively low, it meant that many people refrained from seeking help, despite having a need for it., 979852=DCISM Danish Centre for International Studies and Human Rights Established in 2002 for the promotion of research, analyses and information activities in Denmark on international affairs such as security and development policy, conflict research, the Holocaust, genocide and political mass murder, as well as human rights in Denmark and abroad. Consists of the Danish Institute for International Studies (http://www.diis.dk) and the Danish Institute for Human Rights (http://www.humanrights.dk). http://www.dcism.dk, 900547=In 2007, USD 17.6 million was spent on research and research capacity building in developing countries. The parameters governing the use of the funds are laid down by a Consultative Research Committee for Development Research (FFU), which was set up by the Minister for Development Cooperation in 2006 with the aim of ensuring more strategic use of the research grants and strengthening the link between the research and the practical development work., 106342=Chairman of the OECD\u2019s Development Assistance Committee, DAC, Richard Manning, to the Foreign Ministry\u2019s publication on development \u201cUdvikling\u201d when he was in Copenhagen 14 September to present the OECD\u2019s Peer Review of Danish assistance, 341172=The link between climate and development has been a Danish priority for several years. In 2005, Denmark, as one of the first countries in the world to do so, formulated a Climate and Development Action Programme, and Denmark began a process of climate-proofing its development assistance in all programme countries. Climate proofing does not solely look at the Danish assistance, but also at how climate change in general will affect the beneficiary countries, and how Denmark most effectively can help the countries to adapt to the impacts of global warming., 239659=Afghanistan\u2019s central government also agrees that this should be a primary area of focus. In December 2007 the Afghan Minister for Education held, with Danish support, a very successful \u201ceducation jiirga\u201d in Helmand. The Minister promised that the Government was ready to build 100 new schools within Helmand with Danish financing if the population would themselves take responsibility for reopening the existing schools., 299440=The humanitarian assistance in this table consists of the sum of the humanitarian assistance that is reported as bilateral (Appropriations Act, Section 06.39.02) and the humanitarian assistance that is reported as multilateral (Appropriations Act, Section 06.39.01., 560276=There were several lively debates in parliament in 2007, and the media began to play a more critical role. They made greater use of their rights than before and asked questions about several potential cases of power abuse, financial crime and corruption. In this context, it was positive that the revised Anti-Corruption Law entered into force at the beginning of 2007. The law was a central issue in Denmark\u2019s dialogue with the government, in which it was made a condition for the award of development assistance directly through Tanzania\u2019s state budget in 2006 and 2007., 202417=In 2007 Denmark sent observers through the EU to elections in nine countries: Ecuador, Guatemala, Kenya, Mauritania, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Togo, Indonesia and Pakistan., 206316=\u00b9 Appropriation Act frames \u00b2 As of the financial year 2006, the frames have been reorganised from disbursement management to commitment management, 624181=Zoellick started out softly and appears to be more uniting figure than Wolfowitz. For example, at the bank\u2019s annual meeting in October he made a good impression on the member countries\u2019 finance and development ministers, and the general view is that the World Bank is back on the right track., 314577=The report and the IPCC\u2019s long-standing work on climate change led the IPCC to win the Nobel Prize in 2007, which was jointly awarded to the long-standing American climate change activist and former vice-president, Al Gore. It was very indicative that they were not awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics, but instead the prestigious Nobel Prize for Peace., 909523=In March 2007, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs opened a Third World Blog at http://www.u-web.dk, which is the Ministry\u2019s website for children and young people. The blog is written by ten young Ghanaians who tell about their daily life, their interests, their hopes and their dreams. The issues include, among others, friendship, love, education, religion and HIV/AIDS., 245063=The goals of Denmark\u2019s activities in Iraq are to assist the Iraqis in assuming responsibility for their own security and to support the popularly-elected government with the reconstruction of the country, including supporting a sustainable democracy. Up to the end of 2007 Denmark had granted a total of almost USD 55.1 million in humanitarian aid to Iraq, of which USD 23.9 million in 2007. Additionally, Denmark provided USD 48.5 million for reconstruction, of which USD 7.9 million was granted in 2007., 474143=The process, however, is not without challenges and entails, among other things, that the voters themselves must actively register themselves as such. For the election to the National Council (upper house) in December 2007, 80 per cent of the electorate was registered. A relatively broad section of the population participated, with a slight predominance of female election participants. Four of the female candidates were elected directly to the Council\u2019s 20 seats in total, and the king appointed a further five members, two of whom were women., 910470=The Third World Blog was active from 15 March to 30 April. The blog has now ended, but the contributions, questions and comments of the young Ghanaians and Danes are still posted on the website. The Third World Blog and http://www.u-web.dk as a whole can usefully be incorporated in the subjects of English, social studies and history \u2013 as well as in cross-disciplinary projects. The target group for the site is pupils in the oldest classes in the Folkeskole (Danish Primary and Lower Secondary School)., 531616=In connection with the extensive floods in February-March, Mozambique demonstrated that the country could tackle its problems by itself., 409900=The Learning Labs project has been allocated USD 0.9 million in support through the Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) Programme. The PPP Programme was launched in 2004 for the purpose of supporting the establishment of partnerships between Danish companies and local companies, organisations and public institutions. The partnerships aim at contributing to improving working and living conditions in developing countries through socially directed initiatives and sustainable investments., 535428=Since 1992, Mozambique has with a few exceptions had average real annual growth of 7-8 per cent. The positive development continued in 2007 with a growth rate of 7.5 per cent. On 1 January 2008, new and lower tariff rates entered into force in SADC. This means that a number of goods will become cheaper for Mozambique, but it also means that it will become even more difficult for producers particularly in southern Mozambique to compete with goods coming from South Africa., 320075=The Danish contribution has gone to, among other things, coastal zone management, mangrove planting, environmentally sound urban development and also to the trust fund secretariat\u2019s work on launching pro-environment projects in the Aceh province in general. The reconstruction work in the Aceh province has made considerable progress, but the multi-donor trust fund will run until 2010., 358605=Denmark initiated its support to FTI with a sum of USD 4.6 million in 2007. The Danish contribution will rise to USD 15.6 million in 2008 and to USD 24.8 million in 2009. In total, 28 countries have to date received between USD 8 million and USD 121 million dollars from FTI for the purpose of financing their education sector plans. Three programme countries with Danish support to education have received support, namely Benin, Mozambique and Nicaragua. During 2008-09, a further 14 countries are expected to receive support., 863676=Goal fulfilment for 2007 was evaluated as being generally satisfactory: 79 per cent, meaning by far the majority of the targets, were rated as having been achieved very satisfactorily or satisfactorily. The level has remained extremely constant: from the start in 2004 and up to and including 2006, the figure has been between 81-83 per cent., 990924=ICI International Cocoa Initiative ICI was founded in July 2002 to fight the worst forms of child labour in cocoa production and to improve the earning possibilities of cocoa farmers., 263667=First and foremost is the AU, the African Union, which was formed in 2002 as a more active replacement for its somewhat toothless predecessor, the Organisation for African Unity. At the time the AU was created, the African countries did away with the principle of non-involvement in internal matters and switched to a principle of \u201cnon-indifference\u201d to internal matters, especially conflicts. This has paved the way for the AU to be able to play a much more active role in Africa\u2019s conflicts, for example in Sudan and Somalia., 256130=The peace agreement from 2005 includes a roadmap leading to democratic elections and a referendum where the citizens in Southern Sudan are to decide whether they wish to remain as a part of a unified Sudan or prefer independence. Democratic elections at all levels \u2013 presidential, parliamentary and locally \u2013 are scheduled to take place in 2009, and the referendum in the South in 2011., 63345=Already in 1996 a law was passed outlawing female genital mutilation in Burkino Faso, and the West African country is among 16 countries in Africa that have passed legislation against female genital mutilation. Therefore, many people were shocked when, in September 2007, it became known that a 14-year-old girl had died after having been circumsised in the small town of Pabr\u00e9, just 15 km outside the capital, Ouagadougou. The girl was just one of 15 girls who had all undergone genital mutilation during the week ending 17 September., 210986=In the meantime, the World Bank had also appointed a new president, Paul Wolfowitz, and he welcomed the initiative. At the annual meeting of the World Bank in Singapore in 2006, his own controversial proposal regarding corruption and good governance was, unexpectedly, not adopted and this made Wolfowitz cautious about promoting the trust fund., 95314=In 2020, 95 per cent of the populations of East and Southeast Asia will be living in middle-income countries. Only Burma, Laos and Cambodia will continue to remain among the low-income countries, if the current development trends continue., 576561=** Debt relief totalling USD 0.6 million was also disbursed in 2007, 417018=The production is based on recycling of aluminium. This is done not out of consideration for the environment, but because it has been shown that purchasing aluminium scrap from the entire region and recycling it makes good business sense. But in other areas, the environmental behaviour of the company needed careful scrutiny, which is why it was put into contact with the Danish Technological Institute in 2004 through the Private Sector Development (PSD) Programme, which was later renamed the Business-to-Business (B2B) Programme., 915781=In 2007, Danida\u2019s Information Grant awarded support to, among other things, the TV programme, \u201cToo many cooks \u2013 new ways in development assistance\u201d, which was produced by Dansk AV-Produktion v/Anders Dencker Christensen., 141281=All donors have pledged to provide at least 0.15 per cent of GNI to the Least Developed Countries (LDC) \u2013 the percentage for Denmark is approximately twice that figure. At the same time an increasing percentage of Danish assistance is going to the social sectors, including education, healthcare and water and sanitation. Furthermore, in 2007 Denmark placed special focus on women\u2019s issues, HIV/AIDS and good governance., 413141=The Bolivian enterprise, Altifibers, was established in 1990 in order to export raw natural wool, especially llama, which is quite unique. Approx. 1,000 tonnes of llama are produced annually in Bolivia, and the fibres are over 50cm long and very strong. Furthermore, the fibres are hollow, making them super-light and giving them an insulating quality., 647340=In 1957, the organisation \u201cFlying Doctors of East Africa\u201d was founded. The objective was to fly doctors and other healthcare staff out to large areas in East Africa that were otherwise never \u2013 or at least rarely \u2013 paid a visit by a doctor. Much has changed since then. The small aircraft with doctors still fly, but the organisation has acquired a far wider sphere of activity and has changed its name to AMREF, the African Medical and Research Foundation., 310141=The international NGO, Development Assistance Research Associates, is also working to improve humanitarian efforts, and in November 2007 published for the first time a \u201cHumanitarian Response Index\u201d 2007. The Index measures how well the donor countries fulfil the principles for good humanitarian practice. Denmark was well placed, coming in third after Sweden and Norway., 997622=MIFRESTA. The Environment, Peace and Stability Facility In 1993, MIKA, Milj\u00f8- og Katastroferammen (The Environment and Disaster Fund) was set up as Denmark\u2019s special facility for humanitarian assistance and environmental assistance to Central and Eastern Europe and the developing countries. In 1999, the name was changed to MIFRESTA, Milj\u00f8-, Freds- og Stabilitetsrammen (The Environment, Peace and Stability Facility). Danida administers the part of MIFRESTA that is concerned with developing countries together with the development assistance., 879909=Since 2004 the Danish embassies in the 16 programme countries have annually evaluated overall goal fulfilment of their country programmes. 2007 became the first year that all the embassies judged their goal fulfilment as \u201csatisfactory\u201d or \u201cvery satisfactory\u201d., 386088=In the period 1999-2005, 5.8 million people in seven of the world\u2019s poor countries gained access to safe drinking water thanks to Danish support. This support also secured 3.8 million people access to better sanitation conditions. The figures stem from an evaluation published in 2007 of Denmark\u2019s support to water and sanitation in Bangladesh, Benin, Burkina Faso, Egypt, Ghana, Uganda and Vietnam between 1999 and 2005., 477041=In 2007, a new country strategy for the cooperation between Denmark and Bhutan for 2008-2013 was prepared. Before the country strategy is launched on 1 July 2008, it must be aligned with Bhutan\u2019s 10th five-year plan, which will be adopted by the new parliament. The development cooperation with Bhutan will be phased out gradually in order to concentrate the efforts on the poorest countries., 586656=In connection with the summit in Lusaka in August, Zambia took over the presidency of the regional cooperation organisation, SADC., 562438=An important prerequisite for increased growth is also improvement of Tanzania\u2019s infrastructure. The transport costs of the private sector are higher than in a number of comparable countries, and the absence of security of electricity supply is a barrier to increased private investments in Tanzania. In partnership with 13 other donors, Denmark supports the reforms that Tanzania plans to implement in the energy and transport sector. This support is provided directly to Tanzania\u2019s state budget. In addition, the Danish support to the transport sector will continue up to 2011, where the focus is on maintenance and traffic safety in the national and local road network, partly with a view to reducing the transport costs of enterprises., 415668=In 2007, the B2B Programme awarded approx. USD 36.7 million to projects in Denmark\u2019s programme countries. Interest in the programme had previously been greatest in countries like Vietnam, India and Bangladesh, but several years\u2019 persistent efforts to generate greater interest in using the B2B Programme in Africa are now beginning to pay off. In 2007, 65 per cent of the total grant allocation went to collaboration projects between African and Danish enterprises. In particular Kenya, Uganda and Egypt accounted for the increased activity in Africa, where more and more projects involve female entrepreneurs and focus on the social responsibility of enterprises., 689044=Notes: 1) Entered contracts. MNA services is missing in the figures for 2006. 2) The amount includes entered contracts only. 3) Active project investment loan cumulative procurement. 4) In the last couple of years, Danish enterprises have received large contracts under the programme, to which considerably more resources have also been added during the period. In 2006, EDF transferred to a new budget method and therefore no meaningful figures are available. 5) The TACIS statistics cover allotted contracts of EUR 200,000 or higher. 6) EU statistics are only calculated at lead-partner level, which is why Danish percentage shares are considerably higher. 7) Figures for 2007 have not yet been published. The total is for all goods and services in the entire UN system, and is thus higher than the sum of the selected UN organisations that have been included., 269255=Northern Uganda is the home of one of the longest lasting conflicts in Africa, which is being played out between the Ugandan government and the rebel group, Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, LRA. In July 2006 the parties entered into peace negotiations in Juba in Southern Sudan under the leadership of the Sudanese vice president, Riek Machar. The negotiations continued and showed good, though slow, progress throughout 2007 and into 2008., 585834=In 2007, a process was launched to revise Zambia\u2019s constitution, where one of the main items will be to examine the distribution of power in the country. The process began in earnest in December with the establishment of the so-called National Constitutional Conference (NCC). In the next one and a half years, a total of 500 members from parliament, political parties, ministries, churches and civil society will endeavour to reach agreement on a draft for a new constitution that is to be approved in a referendum before 2011., 634677=The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) was established at the end of 1999 as a private-public partnership on the initiative of WHO and UNICEF and with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation as the largest private donor. The objective was to increase vaccination efforts in the world\u2019s 75 poorest countries, efforts which had come to a standstill in developing countries generally., 108333=The word \u201cpeer\u201d means \u201cequal\u201d, and the review \u2013 or evaluation \u2013 was also conducted by a group of equals. It was conducted by the DAC, which stands for \u2019Development Assistance Committee\u2019. The DAC is a division of the OECD, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Every four years each DAC Member State\u2019s assistance undergoes an evaluation, and the Netherlands and Greece were responsible for reviewing Danish assistance in 2007., 505467=In 2007, many Ghanaians enjoyed a slightly better standard of living, and the country has a goal of becoming a middle-income country by 2015. Recent oil discoveries will help achieve this goal., 901450=Moreover, the free research funds will be injected with an extra pool of USD 4.6 million in 2008 and USD 9.2 million in 2009 for the purpose of conducting research into medicine and health of special relevance to the poor countries., 491877=The country\u2019s economy continues to be extremely vulnerable to extreme conditions, such as climate and global market prices for raw materials. In this respect, 2007 was characterised by heavy floods, which caused farmers major problems. The rising oil prices and falling export revenues from cotton due to low prices on the world market also contributed to a 4 per cent drop in GNI growth in 2007, or what corresponded to real growth per capita of around 1 per cent., 72104=In 2007 UNIFEM presented an ambitious strategic plan for the coming years. The plan is based on the supposition that donor contributions will continue to rise. 2007 was also the year when the organisation\u2019s executive director, Noeleen Heyzer from Singapore, stepped down. She had held the post since 1994. Who is to replace her has not yet been decided, but a number of candidates have been mentioned., 502656=The activity level in the B2B Programme in Egypt is satisfactory, with approval of new partnerships totalling USD 4.4 million. In 2007, the B2B Programme organised a visit by an ICT delegation with 13 Danish enterprises. Egypt has a highly skilled labour force in the field of ICT, which is attractive to Danish ICT companies., 337519=A total of 1.2 billion people on the planet today already live in areas where the threshold for sustainable utilisation of the available water resources has been reached or exceeded, and the UNDP estimates that the figure will rise to three billion people by 2025. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that the yield from the crops that are reliant on rainfall will fall by up to 50 per cent in Africa in the period up to 2020 due to climate change., 1006022=UN United Nations Works for world peace and economic and social progress. The organisation was created on 24 October 1945 with 51 members. Almost all countries of the world are now members, a total of 191. The General Assembly is held once per annum and each country has one vote. The great powers have permanent seats on the UN Security Council and are able to issue vetoes. http://www.un.dk or http://www.un.org., 855059=One indicator for how the public agricultural consultancy service performed, for example, was the number of farmers the service managed to reach. The target for 2007 was set at 222,300, but the service performed actually reached slightly more than 285,000. Thus, the rate of target achievement was 128 per cent., 139376=In compliance with its development policy objective, the Government made it clear in 2007 that Denmark\u2019s development assistance would not fall below 0.80 per cent of the gross national income (GNI). In its new Government Platform from November 2007, \u201cThe Society of Opportunities\u201d, the Government aim at increasing assistance from 0.8 per cent of GNI. This maintains Denmark as one of the most prominent development donors in the world and one of the few that live up to the UN\u2019s objective of providing 0.7 per cent of GNI in development assistance. Only four other countries \u2013 Sweden, Norway, Luxembourg and the Netherlands \u2013 provide proportionally as much or more than Denmark., 384059=Denmark has supported two projects in southern Zambia as part of the broad Danish support to the water and sanitation sector. In the towns of Bbilili and in Kabwe Kaslala, the establishment of irrigation facilities has helped local farmers, enabling them to cultivate sales crops also during the drought season between May and October. This ensures them a real income and thus a better standard of living., 592989=Indeed, in its 2007 review of Danish development assistance, OECD-DAC commended Denmark\u2019s multilateral assistance, but at the same time remarking that there was room for improvement. The multilateral assistance could be more targeted, and action should be taken to ensure better coordination with Denmark\u2019s bilateral assistance., 710261=Disabled Peoples Organisations Denmark (DPOD), which until 2007 was called the Danish Council of Organisations of Disabled People (DSI), is an umbrella organisation for 32 member organisations and has for many years been engaged in the fight to ensure rights for disabled people in developing countries. Since 1994, these efforts have taken place in a long-term partnership agreement between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and DPOD, and Danish disability organisations today are responsible for development activities totalling USD 4.6-5.5 million annually, distributed between 11 developing countries., 335279=In February 2007, two Danish ministries - the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Climate and Energy - launched a joint Danish strategy on CO2 credits. The strategy states that Denmark must make active use of the CDM system and another system under the Kyoto Protocol, \u201cJoint Implementation\u201d, which is primarily used in relation to Eastern Europe., 50093=Women and gender equality came to characterise Danish development cooperation in 2007, and after the Danish general election in November, the Governent initiated a special effort intended to strengthen the third of the eight primary Millennium Development Goals, specifically the goal concerning gender equality., 308350=The World Bank\u2019s Global Facility for Disaster Risk Reduction, GFDRR, got a baptism of fire in connection with the flooding resulting from cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh in November 2007 and it lived up to the challenge. On 26 November 2007, for the first time the GFDRR issued an appeal for funds for swift reconstruction and re-housing. Denmark led the way with a contribution of USD 1.8 million., 554281=During 2007, the new government formulated a national transport strategy, which \u2013 based on the lessons learned from the cooperation with Denmark \u2013 aims to secure the development and maintenance of the local road network in the municipalities. Denmark has been asked to act as coordinator for the donors operating in the sector., 926922=Section 20. The Act shall enter into force on 1 October 1971. The provision in Section 16 shall, however, enter into force on 1 January 1972., 577476=Denmark contributes to strengthening good governance, and in 2007 a new programme was launched that, among other things, involves cooperation between the parliament and the Danish Ombudsman and supports training of parliamentarians and their secretariat. The programme also contains support to reforms of the public administration in four provinces., 183080=In 1989 Nepal was chosen as a Danish programme country, among other reasons because of the ongoing democratisation process that was taking place at that time and the extremely widespread poverty in the country. Nepal was then \u2013 and still is \u2013 the poorest country in Southern Asia and one of the poorest countries in the world. It is estimated that approximately 32 per cent of the total population of the country lives below the poverty line., 890949=The cost of conducting the evaluations totalled USD 2.6 million in 2007. In addition, USD 0.8 million was spent on communicating the results of the evaluations and on preparing new evaluations as well as smaller studies. By the end of the year, nine evaluations as well as three evaluation studies were being conducted., 25761=Africa possesses an enormous unutilised driving force for development \u2013 women. In 2007 the Government placed special focus on strenghtening women\u2019s rights and economic opportunities in developing countries. For if the poor African countries are to realise their potential and participate in the benefits of globalisation, then women must have the same rights and economic opportunities as the other half of the population. The first part of the annual report focuses on women., 860820=To what extent are the objectives of the many Danish assistance programmes being achieved? In order to ensure an on-going overview of this, in 2002 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs established a simple measuring system that has since undergone further development. Targets have been selected for each component in the sector programmes in the 16 programme countries as well as in Niger, South Africa, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Palestinian Self Rule Areas and Thailand. In, for example, an education programme this could be how many children are attending school., 76493=Strictly speaking, the struggle to make access to sexual and reproductive healthcare and rights a part of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) had been won. This happened at the UN Summit Meeting in 2005. Moreover, in 2006 the goal was even concretised as an official new MDG Target. Both of these developments occured with Denmark among the most outspoken advocates., 246158=At the end of 2007 the majority of assistance activities were completed in the region around Basra where Danish assistance, despite extremely difficult conditions due especially to the problematic security situation, has made a difference:, 148130=The HIPC Initiative is based on the countries living up to a number of requirements for reform, which are to contribute to ensuring that the funds that are freed through debt relief are used with a focus on combating poverty. In 2006 the World Bank\u2019s evaluation unit undertook an evaluation of the HIPC Initiative The report concluded that the initiative has been a general success. It has succeeded in reducing the countries\u2019 debt, and expenses targeted at poverty reducing activities have increased by approximately one-third., 390901=The agricultural sector represents more than 40 per cent of all jobs in Bolivia, and Denmark is supporting the sector with USD 42.9 million in the period 2005-2010. The Danish support focuses on the development of the small-scale farms on the highland plateau. By improving the livelihoods of smallholder farmers, the goal is to reduce poverty and counter migration to the capital, La Paz, and the neighbouring countries., 692069=The above two suppliers account for 100 per cent of building and construction services in 2007, amounting to USD 45.2 million., 981163=DSHC Danish Seed Health Centre Financed by Danida and was established 1 January 2004. The task of the centre is to help developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America to strengthen and build up local expertise in order to improve seed health and quality., 645276=*Calculated as of July 2007. The figures include an average number of staff on short-term contracts (consultants, etc) who are at any time attached to the organisation., 449096=In this regard, district heating is on its way to a good section of the population in Jiamusi. In 2007, a district-heating project totalling USD 8.1 million was approved as a mixed credit project. The project will benefit the poorest part of the population, which will have access to stable and climate-friendly low-cost heating. The project will also ensure that the surplus heat produced by the power plant in the town is utilised in a brand new district-heating system that can replace around 100 small \u2013 heavily polluting \u2013 coal-fired power plants., 79674=Denmark does not settle for providing moral support to reproductive healthcare and rights. The Danish support to the UN\u2019s Population Fund, UNFPA, rose from USD 31.2 million in 2003 and has, since 2004, amounted to USD 33.0 million a year, and it is expected to rise an additional USD 9.2 million annually from 2008. Moreover, Denmark granted USD 1.7 million to the Global Safe Abortion Fund in 2006. The fund supports NGOs that have lost donor support from, for example, the USA because the USA does not support NGOs that refuse to disassociate themselves from abortion., 908439=Information about development 2007, 496675=Economic reforms and a positive development in the world market gave excellent key figures for Egypt, which in 2007 experienced healthy increases in both exports and foreign investments., 476298=The present urban development and environmental sector support runs until 2009. Here, Danida has provided support to water purification facilities, waste management and environmental issues in rural areas. A total of 70 per cent of Bhutan is covered by forest, and it has been written into the constitution that the country\u2019s forest area must never be allowed to fall below 60 per cent., 999247=NEPAD The New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development An initiative from 2001 created by a number of African governments. Through market economy, fighting corruption, democracy and good government in the affiliated countries, NEPAD is to play a part in ensuring donor support for Africa. A programme under the African Union (AU) since 2002. The West has shown great interest in the initiative, but is holding its economic support until it can be seen whether the African countries submit to the external monitoring foreseen in the initiative. http://www.nepad.org, 639292=At the end of 2006, the World Health Organisation (WHO) acquired a new Director-General, Margaret Chan. In April 2007, she paid a visit to Denmark and took the opportunity to state clearly that the old organisation \u2013 WHO was created in 1948 \u2013 faces completely new challenges with the emergence of the many new global health funds and initiatives., 417559=The initial contact was promising, and in 2005 the collaboration was awarded USD 0.9 million in support under the PSD Programme. The funds were to go to training, consultancy support, new technology, environmental improvements and equipment., 570527=In 2007, Denmark took the initiative to formulate a strategy that supports the democratic process up to 2011. More than 12 bilateral development partners and the UN stand behind the work. The strategy focuses on six areas which include support to, among other things, the parliament, the Electoral Commission of Uganda and a free press. It will be crucial that the initiatives are implemented with broad Ugandan support that cuts across party lines and contributes to building bridges between the northern and southern part of the country\u2019s current geopolitical division between an opposition majority in the north and a government majority in the south., 588936=The Danish Minister for Development Cooperation visited Zambia in March and had political talks with the Minister of Finance, the Minister for Local Administration and the Minister of Trade. Together with the vice-president, the Minister for Development Cooperation opened the first landfill site in the capital, Lusaka. In addition, the Minister for Development Cooperation visited, among other things, a prison in Lusaka, a teacher training college, a children\u2019s home, a centre for natural resource management and a boarding school for orphans. The Zambian Minister of Foreign Affairs visited Denmark in October and had political talks with both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Development Cooperation., 708600=In 2007, the results of the nationwide fund-raising campaigns were as follows:, 527924=During 2007, Denmark also prepared two programmes in, respectively, the agricultural sector amounting to USD 27.6 million and the business sector amounting to USD 34.0 million. Both programmes run for a five-year period and agreements were signed with Mali\u2019s authorities in November 2007., 976188=AU African Union. Cooperation organisation between the African countries, formed from the OAU, Organisation for African Unity in 2002. http://www.africa-union.org, 551059=The new government for national reunion and unity under the leadership of Sandinist Party leader, Daniel Ortega, took office in January 2007 after having won the election with 38 per cent of the vote. Despite being a minority government, its position is relatively stable, as the opposition parties have difficulty in finding common ground., 127639=With the Millennium Development Goals, the goals for the joint effort were defined. With the Paris Declaration in 2005 concerning more effective aid, the means for achieving the goals were described., 33663=*) The assistance amounts represent the disbursements for 2007 that are to be reported to the OECD/DAC as Denmark\u2019s Official Development Assistance. A detailed specification of Denmark\u2019s assistance based on the disbursements included under Sections 06.3 and 06.11.19 as well as those disbursements that fall outside of those Sections can be found on pages 154-160., 181208=In 2007 the Government assigned high priority to three focus areas:, 88445=Figures from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) document, for example, that a total of 40 per cent of African countries had a negative annual economic growth in 1992. This fact is starkly contrasted by the figure for 2007, which shows that almost four out of five countries had an annual economic growth of over three per cent. The only African country that experienced negative economic growth in 2007 was Mugabe\u2019s Zimbabwe., 838588=With effect from the financial year 2005, extraordinary humanitarian contributions, IHB and assistance to refugees and internally displaced persons in regions of origin (Appropriations Act Section 06.39.02) are reported as bilateral assistance. Up to and including 2004, these disbursements were reported as multilateral assistance. With effect from 2007, parts of the Neighbourhood Programme Section 06.11.19 are included as bilateral assistance in this table., 614954=The UNDP wins on closer acquaintance, concludes Danish UN Ambassador Carsten Staur after having served as President of the UNDP Executive Board in 2007., 608468=The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) found itself in the midst of a bit of a media storm in parts of the American press in January when Denmark \u2013 in the form of UN Ambassador Carsten Staur \u2013 took over the position as President of the Executive Board of UNDP/UN Population Fund (UNFPA)., 314168=The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published its fourth report, which stated that global warming is fully underway and that there was a 90 per cent certainty that it was partially caused by human behaviour. The report also stated that global greenhouse gas emissions would need to peak by 2020 at the latest if the world is to avoid the most severe consequences of climate change., 257869=Somalia! Just the name can cause a deep sigh in anyone with even a slight knowledge of Africa and international policy and development. The difficult and conflict-ridden country was formed in 1960 when an attempt was made to unite a British protectorate and a former Italian colony into one country. The attempt never really succeeded. Somalia has been characterised by internal conflict and war ever since., 143631=Taking as a point of departure its own position as a leader, Denmark works on an international level to get more donor countries to meet the UN\u2019s objective of providing at least 0.7 per cent of GNI in development assistance. Only four EU countries including Denmark met that objective in 2007., 218521=This is part of the background for why Denmark has, since 2000, supported an inter-departmental programme whose primary goal is to combat and prevent violence against women and provide support to women who have been victims of violence. Danish support to this programme totals DKK 17.7 million in its present phase, which applies to the period from 2004 to 2008., 586826=Zambia\u2019s economy continues its progress and in 2007 experienced a GNP growth of over 6 per cent, while inflation was kept below 10 per cent. The positive figures are first and foremost the result of a stringent economic policy and steadily rising raw material prices, especially for copper. Copper mining is an important source of revenue for Zambia, which expects a planned taxation of copper mining in 2008 to yield revenue of approx. USD 400 million. This corresponds to two-thirds of the total development assistance to the country., 379192=The Danish support to health in Tanzania is not subjected to any special analysis in the evaluation. However, Denmark is among the largest donors to the Health Basket Fund, which the evaluation highlights in particular. Denmark has supported the health sector in Tanzania for many years, and in the period 2004-09 the Danish support totalled DKK 605 million. Of this amount, 63 per cent \u2013 USD 62.7 million \u2013 is allocated to the Health Basket Fund., 334237=CDM is based on the market mechanisms. Countries like China and Thailand have no difficulties in attracting foreign investors in general or investors for CDM projects. The situation is very different in Sub-Saharan Africa. In October 2007, a total of 2,551 CDM projects were registered globally. Of these projects, only 33 were in Sub-Saharan Africa, corresponding to 1.3 per cent. Moreover, within the region, there was a great difference in the distribution of the projects: 21 of the 33 projects were in South Africa, which is a middle-income country; Kenya was well represented with three projects; Nigeria, Uganda and Tanzania each had two; the Ivory Coast, Senegal and Mauritius each had one project. In the rest of the altogether 45 African countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, there were no CDM projects whatsoever., 598677=The new EU Member States face major challenges in explaining to their population that development assistance must be increased to 0.33 per cent by 2015 and in ensuring that development cooperation is placed higher than the domestic policy agenda., 89368=The World Bank\u2019s report on governance in 212 countries indicates that the majority of African countries are still facing a huge task in fighting corruption as well as creating transparency, political stability and security for their citizens. However, it can be emphasised that the programme countries Mozambique and Tanzania have improved their rankings on the World Bank\u2019s index regarding governance between 1996 and 2006. None of the Danish programme countries experienced a decline in the period between 1996 and 2006., 98165=In the coming years Danish development assistance to Asia will continue to be focused on the four programme countries \u2013 Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Vietnam \u2013 along with Afghanistan. However, the development in Vietnam and Bhutan has been so positive that, in the future, they will be able to manage without such a large amount of assistance, and the two countries are to be gradually phased out. To be precise, the strategy dictates that the last commitments to Vietnam and Bhutan will be made in 2011 and 2012., 986185=GEF Global Environmental Facility Established in 1991. Cooperation between the World Bank, the UN and others. Supports activities that produce environmental gains in the areas of biodiversity, climate change and water. http://www.gefweb.org, 341798=There are enormous interests at stake, and many obstacles must be swept aside in order to secure a satisfactory global climate agreement in Copenhagen in 2009. Therefore, the Danish Government has, among other things, established an inter-ministerial climate secretariat in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office - the Climate Division for the Cabinet Committee on the Preparation for the UN Climate Change Conference in 2009 - and dramatically stepped up its climate diplomacy efforts. The Government will, for example, post climate attach\u00e9s to some of the countries that are key to ensuring a successful conference in Copenhagen, and Denmark has on several occasions highlighted the climate change issue., 522821=Development cooperation between Denmark and Mali began in 2007 with a sector programme for natural resources, water and sanitation as a first step., 456819=In the middle of the year, it was decided that elections were to be held in 2008, with the aim of giving Bangladesh a fresh start., 559949=2007 was characterised by a consolidation of the parliamentary situation and by modest progress in the implementation of economic and administrative reforms. The modest progress made in implementing reforms is due partly to the internal elections in the ruling CCM (Chama Cha Mapinduzi) party that took place in autumn., 887076=In 2007, the Evaluation Department introduced a new element, Evaluation Studies. There exist lots of completed evaluations that are rarely communicated to a broader audience and therefore are not utilised at all as much as they might be. By compiling evaluations from certain areas, easily accessible material is produced which both Danida and others can draw benefit from. Three studies were conducted in 2007:, 874882=The usual thinking on the matter is that it is only possible to create joint strategies in developing countries that are fairly well functioning, and Kenya did meet that criterion when the strategy was signed. However, the country has not seemed to be doing so well since the election on 27 December 2007. But, in the unrest in the wake of the election, having entered into the ambitious agreement has proved to have been an advantage., 247197=The Danish-supported activities in the south have now been handed over to the Iraqis. In March 2007 Denmark established a Technical Advisory Office in Baghdad, attached to the Danish embassy, whose function is to assist in building the capacity of the central authorities. The Advisory Office is run by a private consultancy firm. Four advisers are stationed at the Office, where there are to be up to 10 Danish-financed advisers during 2008. In August 2007 a Danish-Iraqi seminar took place regarding Danish assistance to the central authorities. At the seminar, consensus was reached on focusing Danish capacity-building activities on agriculture, human rights, transport, migration, strategic planning and donor coordination., 450113=The Republic of Armenia was formerly a part of the Soviet Union and was often referred to as the Soviet Union\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d. However, the economy collapsed completely after the country became independent in 1991., 343973=Despite the huge focus on climate change, the events at the Climate Change Conference in Bali in December 2007 underlined that there are many obstacles on the road towards a satisfactory global climate agreement in Copenhagen in 2009, as the Danish Minister for Climate and Energy, Connie Hedegaard, subsequently expressed it. She herself played an active role during the conference, where Denmark was well represented in the negotiations., 402458=Is there a measurable long-term effect of the extensive and very specific development assistance that Denmark provided in five districts in Tanzania between 1995 and 2002? An evaluation of the HIMA programme in 2007 analysed this question., 425264=The project is supported by the Programme for Public-Private Partnerships (PPP), and the support has financed extensive preliminary work prior to the initial investments that took place in 2007. Over 1,000 enterprises have been screened and around 75 visited by the investment team from the fund., 625007=The objective of the replenishment is to finance IDA\u2019s activities in 2008-11. Besides new development activities \u2013 particularly in Africa \u2013 there is a need for extra funds in this period to finance the extensive debt relief granted to poor countries in recent years. The debt relief applies, for example, to loans that IDA has provided and will result therefore in falling repayments from borrowers in the coming years. Furthermore, if IDA is to maintain its level of activity, more money is needed from its contributors, i.e. the member countries. Denmark attaches great importance to ensuring fair burden-sharing among donors., 340859=The conference in Copenhagen \u2013 or COP 15 \u2013 which we are already getting used to saying \u2013 is particularly important because the 191 countries that have signed the UN Climate Change Convention must no later than 2009 agree on a replacement for the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012., 877127=Demark provides general budget support to six programme countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mozambique, Tanzania and Vietnam. The total amount of Danish general budget support has been steadily increasing, from USD 23.7 million in 2003 to DKK 354 million in 2007. However, it still only amounts to 4.4 per cent of Denmark\u2019s bilateral assistance. It is difficult to find comparable figures for other donors, but Denmark lies at the lower end of the scale. For example, the United Kingdom provides around 20 per cent of its bilateral assistance as general budget support. According to the Danish embassies\u2019 evaluations, recipient countries are becoming more and more suited for receiving general budget support and sector budget support. During the assessment of Denmark\u2019s sector programmes in 2007, the conditions for granting budget support were judged to be satisfactory or very satisfactory in half of the cases, a respectable rise from approximately one third in 2004., 254908=Another pressing problem is ensuring that the two million people that fled from the South to the North during the civil war are able to return to the extent that they wish. In 2007 Denmark contributed USD 3.7 million through the Region of Origin Initiative towards reintegration support to the local communities in Southern Sudan, where the returning refugees and internally displaced people settled. This support is part of the multi-year region of origin effort in Sudan. Additionally, Denmark has granted USD 3.6 million to a three-year support package for a land commission that is to mediate in conflicts concerning ownership and access to land as well as advise the government regarding a new land policy. However, the legislation that is to form the foundation for the Commission has, unfortunately, not been passed by the parliament as yet, so the Danish support has not been disbursed., 594392=In 2007, the UN and the World Bank conducted a mid-term progress review of the Millennium Development Goals. They observed that, on the global level, several of the MDGs looked to be within reach, but that the progress was very unevenly distributed. In general, there was particular difficulty in reaching several of the goals in Sub-Saharan Africa. If the goals were to be reached, significantly increased development efforts would be needed., 867217=The time has come to stop and evaluate and improve MOPAN, the Multilateral Organization Performance Network, the cooperation that nine donor countries entered in 2002. The countries in MOPAN are, besides Denmark, Australia, Canada, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The goal is to create joint analyses of how well international organisations are handling their assignments in developing countries, because it is cheaper and simpler than each donor conducting their own evaluations. The results are also more comprehensive., 428879=In 2007, altogether seven projects with a Danish supplier received final commitments for support amounting to USD 34.5 million. The combined contract sum of the seven projects was USD 79.7 million. This means that Danish assistance amounting to USD 34.5 million triggers contracts of Danish deliveries for a total of USD 79.7 million, which produces a gearing rate of 2.3., 236613=In fact, the Government was already thinking along the same lines and in the report on its priorities for Danish development assistance for the period 2008-2012, \u201cA World for Everyone\u201d, from 2007, the Government announced that guiding principles would be established for Denmark\u2019s commitments in fragile states. The work has already begun and is to be completed in 2008., 443231=In 2007, USD 64.3 million was earmarked by Danish development assistance to mixed credits. The framework covers disbursements to projects that were approved and launched in 2007. Interest support totalling USD 74.2 million was disbursed, and this was possible due to the simultaneous repayment of reserve funds amounting to approx. USD 9.2 million. Each year, funds are placed in reserve to cover future losses, and they are repaid in step with the repayment of the loans., 587897=In general, there was a reduction in poverty in 2007, but it was unequally distributed and was primarily confined to the people living in the large towns., 605144=Lastly, the EU-Africa Summit in December also led to the adoption of a joint action plan for tackling climate change., 41438=Denmark\u2019s role as a donor was no longer defined by a spotless past but by the quality and the quantity of our assistance. This development has been significantly increased by the Paris Declaration from 2005 and its goal of donor harmonisation, which allows even less place for donor countries to leave their own special national mark on assistance. Everyone has become a part of the donorcollective. We are seeing a de-nationalisation of Danish assistance activites and no longer work with Danish country strategies or sector policies. By its very nature this approach involves the risk of creating a lack of understanding for development assistance among the general population in Denmark, which creates the special challenge of providing them with sufficient and relevant information., 646240=The UN Secretariat has also caught sight of Denmark\u2019s under-representation and in 2007 invited Denmark to participate in the upcoming National Competitive Recruitment Exam that the Secretariat holds each year for young academics from invited countries. Danish participation in the Recruitment Exam last happened in 1999. Through briefings and preparation courses, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has engaged in active efforts to encourage as many Danes as possible to participate in the exam. Interest has been high and this led approx. 130 Danes to participate in the Recruitment Exam in February 2008., 527034=The process of building up the development cooperation between Denmark and Mali is conducted in accordance with the agreement and plans that were established in connection with the opening of the Danish embassy in Bamako. The intergovernmental agreement regarding the first sector programme concerning natural resources, water and sanitation was signed in November 2006. The first phase, which amounts to USD 11.9 million, runs for three years until the end of 2009. The goal is to ensure access to safe drinking water for approx. 200,000 people in rural areas. In addition, the programme provides capacity building support for planning and administration of drinking water supply in Mali at both centralised and local level. Denmark is in the process of preparing the second phase of the drinking water programme that will also address the drinking water supply in the large towns., 490418=Burkina Faso held parliamentary elections in May 2007, where President Blaise Compaor\u00e9\u2019s party secured a comfortable majority with 73 out of 111 seats in the parliament. The other seats in the parliament went to the opposition, which, however, due to internal discord has diminished its chances of playing a larger role in the legislative work., 865031=However, suspicions of misuse can also be reported by people outside the embassies. In 2005 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs established an anti-corruption hotline as a supplement to the monitoring performed at the embassies. The hotline can be used through the websites of the Ministry or the individual embassies. The general public, both from within and outside of the recipient country, can use the hotline with complete anonymity., 174435=On this basis, in 2005 the Danish Government launched a new strategy for trade and development with special focus on Sub-Saharan Africa, agriculture, women\u2019s issues and sustainability. Danish assistance continues to be based on this strategy for trade and development that the Government presented in 2005. Danish assistance is provided both bilaterally and within the frameworks of a number of international organisations such as the WTO, as well as through the EU\u2019s development assistance., 371499=However, there is also need for capital. Ghana has a shortage of healthcare staff in general and doctors in particular. For this reason, the government decided in 2006 to raise the salaries of public sector doctors, nurses and other healthcare staff in order to halt the exodus of qualified healthcare practitioners from Ghana., 71157=Gender equality and women\u2019s rights have received higher priority on both the Danish and the international development agendas. This has, i.a., led to the decision to double the Danish contribution, which has remained constant at USD 0.9 million for years, to USD 1.8 million a year as of 2008., 68701=The media is a politically sensitive field in Yemen and it has received Danish support since 2004. In the present phase from 2007 to 2009, the support amounts to just over USD 1.5 million. Just as all other actvities that are supported under the Partnership for Progress and Reform, it involves a large number of both Danish and local institutions and organisations in order to promote the breadth and public rooting of the effort., 888928=In 2006 alone, 315 final reports were submitted on Danish-supported activities. The objective of the reports is not only to assess completed activities, but also to report on experience and lessons learned in order to incorporate them in the delivery of future development assistance., 885079=A 168-page long and thorough evaluation of Tanzania\u2019s healthcare sector in 2007 contained no particular reference to Danish assistance, despite the fact that Denmark, with annual support of around USD 18.4 million, is one of the major donors to the healthcare sector in Tanzania., 220613=It was on this basis that, in 2007, the Danish Government launched a strategy for how Denmark can best contribute to promoting \u201cgood governance\u201d in developing countries., 2594=You can read about Danida\u0092s development assistance effort and its results in Danida\u0092s Annual Report 2007. The Annual Report is structured around the Government\u0092s development assistance priorities for 2007, which were established in \"A World for All \". In articles, tables and figures, the Annual Report shows the way in which Danish development assistance works within all these priority areas. You can also read about the specific efforts and about targets and performance. In 2007 Denmark\u0092s total development assistance amounted to approximately DKK 13.95 billion., 92923=In connection with the debate on the new strategy, everyone had the opportunity to subscribe to receiving news concerning Africa from the Foreign Ministry, and quite a lot of people took advantage of this opportunity. Moreover, the debate concerning Africa is not over. In the Government\u2019s platform after the election in November 2007, the Government established an Africa Commission, which is to provide recommendations for international development cooperation regarding the African continent. The focus of the Commission\u2019s work is young people and employment \u2013 two of the subjects that were identified as most relevant in the Government\u2019s Africa Strategy. The Commission\u2019s recommendations are to be presented in spring 2009. You can follow the work of the Africa Commission at: http://www.africacommission.um.dk., 897007=In 2007, therefore, agreement was reached on a model for gradually phasing out over a five-year period the support to three centres which for decades have received regular framework grants: the Danish Seed Health Centre (DSHC), the Danish Forest and Landscape Research Institute, and the Institute for Health Research and Development (DBL). In 2007, the three centres between them were awarded USD 7.1 million in support. All three centres are now attached to the new University of Copenhagen, with which a comprehensive performance contract has been reached for the five-year phasing-out period. The funding that is released through the gradual phasing out of the fixed support to the centres will be converted into free funding, and researchers from the centres will be able to apply for the free research funds on an equal basis with others., 100665=Latin America is a continent making progress. Democracies are replacing dictatorships and social and economic development are well under way. This is the basis for the first Danish strategy for strengthened engagement in Latin America. It was launched in September 2007 and, in keeping with the Government\u2019s Globalisation Strategy from 2006, includes the entire array of foreign policy instruments: trade, development assistance, political and economic cooperation, and cooperation concerning the environment, art and culture., 534775=In August, a new public prosecutor was appointed. The expectations regarding the new public prosecutor are high, particularly in relation to the fight against corruption., 202213=In 2007 alone Denmark sent out observers through the OSCE to elections in 11 countries: Albania, Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kirgizstan, Kosovo, Croatia, Moldova, Serbia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan., 380349=The enhanced cooperation is now beginning to show real results. It is estimated that almost 900,000 people \u2013 out of a rural population of around six million \u2013gained better access to safe drinking water from 2003 to 2007. This is due not least to the Danish Water Initiative, which involved close collaboration between several donors and local authorities., 182131=In August 2007 the Government presented \u201cA World for All\u201d, which outlined the development policy priorities for 2008-2012., 144820=Within the Nordic+ cooperation (the Nordic countries, the Netherlands, Ireland and Great Britain), Denmark has committed itself to a joint action plan that sets standards for donor cooperation and includes a number of initiatives. In 2007 a group of like-minded donors entered into a cooperative effort with the official American assistance organisation, USAID., 880204=All 16 embassies also judged that the process of aligning donor support to national systems and cooperation with other donors is proceeding satisfactorily or very satisfactorily. In 2004 this was the case in only two-thirds of Denmark\u2019s programme countries, and the development must be seen as an expression of the fact that the work of harmonisation and alignment is bearing fruit and making progress., 206503=MRD assistance to non-programme countries 2007, 707382=The requirement means that NGOs in the future must supplement the contributions they receive from the state with an amount paid from their own, privately raised funds. In 2006, the self-financing requirement was 5 per cent, rising to 10 per cent in 2007, at which level it will remain in the future. The concept of self-financing was introduced to give impetus to a process designed to make NGOs more independent of government support, and all six organisations succeeded in meeting the requirement in both 2006 and 2007., 457963=In August, the country was hit by two violent floods, affecting 40 per cent of the country. Around 500 people died, and there was considerable destruction of crops and infrastructure. In the middle of November, a cyclone struck the country\u2019s coastal areas. However, a new warning system did prove to work, and three million people were successfully evacuated. Nevertheless, over 3,000 people lost their lives and more than five million were affected by the devastation. The Danish Minister for Development Cooperation visited Bangladesh after the cyclone and provided an extra grant of USD 0.9 million to relief work and USD 1.8 million to reconstruction., 997212=Lom\u00e9 Convention. This convention has now been superseded by the Cotonou Agreement, which forms the framework for development policy, economic, commercial and industrial cooperation between the EU and the ACP countries (cf. Cotonou Agreement). http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/r12101.htm, 768724=3) Falls under Appropriations Act Account 06.35.01. Comprises research, projects in Denmark, grants for information activities, cultural cooperation, fact-finding activities as well as seminars, courses and conferences., 540053=On 10 April 2008, an election will be held for a Constituent Assembly that is to draw up a constitution for a new Nepal., 338460=Integrated water resource management has been a key Danish priority for many years. In order to promote the development of the management plans, Denmark played a part in, for example, securing the adoption of a target at the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development whereby all countries no later than 2005 were to have formulated a national plan for integrated water resource management and water efficiency. Denmark contributes to the development of such plans in a number of countries., 561116=Tanzania\u2019s economy maintained a solid economic growth of around 7 per cent in 2007, and inflation continues to remain under control, despite rising upward pressure. Approx. 37 per cent of the state budget of USD 4.8 billion is donor-financed. It is a priority that Tanzania in the long term, in step with economic growth, becomes more capable of financing public expenditure itself., 254731=The government of Southern Sudan considers this education initiative to be the most significant \u201cpeace dividend\u201d to date since the peace agreement in 2005., 50997=2007 was also the year when Denmark developed its first ever strategies for Asia and Latin America. The Africa Strategy was revised as well. A common denominator for all three strategies is cohesion. The strategies do not just concern development assistance but bind together all the various instruments that make up foreign policy: trade, defence, development and security., 838432=The figures for 2006 are adjusted for disbursements under Section 06.11.19 and cannot be compared with tables from previous years., 807824=Explanatory note, see under table for Denmark\u2019s bilateral assistance, 2007, 249273=However, there has also been a great deal that has worked, and there are now signs that the Commission has finally found its place and is ready to play the more active role that was originally envisaged. For example, it is encouraging that the Office for Peacebuilding, which is attached to the Commission, has under the leadership of the UN\u2019s Assistant Secretary-General, Carolyn McAskie, received a permanent budget and the desired number of positions, and that the Peacebuilding Fund has achieved its goal of donor contributions totalling USD 250 million in 2007. This secures both the personnel and money with which to carry out the intended work., 52195=The DAC also encouraged Denmark to undertake an evaluation of the decentralisation of Danish development assistance since 2003. The suggestion was not an expression of criticism but a recognition of the fact that Denmark was one of the first to begin work in this area and has gained experience that many others could benefit from. Work on such an evaluation of Denmark\u2019s experience with decentralisation has also begun., 479497=In 2007, Bolivia embarked on a vision for the country\u2019s future., 536880=In February-March, there were extensive floods in central parts of Mozambique, resulting in the displacement of 65-70,000 people. Mozambique tackled the problems and issued no international appeal for emergency relief. The episode demonstrates that Mozambique today is less dependent on emergency relief from other countries than previously., 350643=The objective was not just to rescue the little baby elephant, which had been found alone and dehydrated in the Lower Zambezi Valley National Park, where CLZ has worked to protect the animal kingdom since 1995. The action to rescue the only five-week-old elephant, which was quickly christened Zamma, was also a huge event in Zambia and helped set increased focus on the growing problem of poachers, a problem which is threatening animal life \u2013 especially the elephants in Zambia \u2013 and thus also one of the country\u2019s and the population\u2019s most important sources of income, i.e. tourism., 216239=A good deal of progress has been made since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. However, violence against women is still widespread. Studies show that more than half of the women in Afghanistan are subject to violence in the home, and forced marriages are extremely common. Many women suffer from trauma and depression, and suicide by self-immolation is a frighteningly widespread phenomenon., 58714=In November 2007 Niger\u2019s capital, Niamey, hosted an event that few people would think of in connection with the poor West African country: a fashion festival for female African entrepreneurs, \u201cFemmes Entrepreneurs en Vogue\u201d. At the festival, 42 African textile enterprises from 11 different countries presented their widely different collections. 39 of the 42 enterprises are led and/or owned by women., 543345=However, at the beginning of 2008 the Seven-Party Alliance reached agreement regarding a joint platform for the election, which, among other things, entailed an adjustment of the electoral system, whereby a larger number of candidates were to be elected using a system of proportional representation. Agreement was also reached to abolish the monarchy at the first meeting of the Constituent Assembly., 517908=Kenya is a regional centre that supplies a large part of Central Africa with industrial goods and services. The economy is strongly market-based, and development assistance accounts for only a modest 8 per cent of the budget. In 2007, inflation (excl. food products) lay at an acceptable 6-8 per cent., 325863=Both the member countries themselves and Denmark wished to change this situation, which is why the Danish Minister for Development Cooperation, Ulla T\u00f8rn\u00e6s, and Vietnam\u2019s Minister of Agriculture, Cao Duc Phat, took the initiative to hold an international conference in Hanoi in April 2007., 305501=Immediately following the disaster Denmark provided USD 0.9 million in emergency aid through the Danish Red Cross and Save the Children Denmark, as well as USD 1.8 million through the World Bank\u2019s Global Facility for Disaster Risk Reduction (GFDRR). After Minister for Development Cooperation Ulla T\u00f8rn\u00e6s had visited the disaster area in December, she decided to grant an additional USD 0.9 million to the work of the local aid organisation, Action Aid, among the poorest segment of the population in districts that were especially hard hit., 473013=Bhutan\u2019s historical transition from monarchy to parliamentary democracy gathered pace in earnest in 2007. The democratic process is now ready to be implemented on the basis of a draft constitution, which Denmark, among others, has commented on., 627758=The World Bank has at times been criticised for not playing a sufficiently active role in the efforts to realise the Paris Declaration from 2005 regarding more effective aid. For example, Denmark holds the view that the World Bank has not adequately decentralised staff and decision-making authority to its country offices in the recipient countries., 854161=In 2005 both the preparation of phase 2 of PROAGRI and the Danish sector programme support began, which meant, and still means, that Denmark does not set special indicators and targets for the portion of Danish agricultural support that is earmarked for PROAGRI 2. This is because PROAGRI 2 was jointly planned with the Ministry of Agriculture in Mozambique and the eight donors that are contributing to the programme., 628984=When Denmark in 2005 formulated a new strategy for support to combating HIV/AIDS in developing countries, the Government promised at the same time that the Danish efforts in this field were to be doubled, so that by 2010 they would amount to USD 0.2 billion (1 billion Danish Kroner) per year., 161088=Notes: * Source: the Danish Energy Agency\u2019s \u201cEnergy Statistics 2006\u201d, ** The figures used are from 1989, *** Source: The Danish Environmental Protection Agency., 267140=The mines have lain there as an uncomfortable reminder of the civil-war-like conflict between the Sandinista Government and the \u201ccontras\u201d between 1981 and 1990. They were laid in the border areas in particular and have thus severely curbed traffic to neighbouring countries. Mines were also placed around electricity masts, power plants and other significant strategic locations in the country., 101680=The strategy was the result of dialogue with NGOs, researchers, experts, business people and others with an understanding of and experience from Latin America and it does not try to hide the Danish interests that exist in increasing cooperation: Danish enterprises\u2019 exports to and investments in Latin America are at a lower level than the countries with which we normally compare ourselves. This is something that the new strategy and the opening of a new Danish Embassy in Argentina in 2007 and a Consulate General in S\u00e3o Paola in Brazil are to help rectify., 202145=82 election observers were sent out in 2007, 355023=Nonetheless, development strategies and development cooperation have over the years had a tendency to prioritise specific yet changing areas. And this has to a certain degree taken place at the expense of the entirety. In different periods, there has been changing focus on agriculture, industry and the social welfare sectors \u2013 most recently inspired by the launch of the Millennium Development Goals in 2000., 606452=On 7-9 November, the local-global warming caused the inland ice to melt \u2013 all the way down to Lisbon. Fortunately, the melting of a solid block of ice containing a frozen prehistoric lizard was not for real, but simply an illustrative climate model at the Danish stand at European Development Days (EDD). EDD was organised by the EU Commission and Portugal, the country holding the EU Presidency at the time. The theme for EDD was Climate Change and Development Cooperation, and Denmark had joined together with Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to set up a joint stand., 705528=Rigsrevisionen (Danish National Audit Office) had mostly nothing but praise when it presented its report in March on Danish NGO assistance. Earlier, Rigsrevisionen had identified problems in the administration of the NGOs\u2019 project accounts, but this now appeared to be a thing of the past. At any rate, Rigsrevisionen was generally satisfied with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u2019 administration of NGO assistance., 40506=HOLGER BERNT HANSEN, CHAIRMAN, 1996-2007, 607409=At the Danish part of the stand, the ice-block was placed in the middle of a children\u2019s paddling pool, which was filled with different kinds of LEGO jungle and farm animals. And with Lisbon\u2019s November sun and the warmth of the exhibition hall, the ice-block melted, with the result that the Tyrannosaurus Rex gradually became visible and the LEGO animals, houses and people became submerged. Visitors to the stand could read about climate-proofing of Danish development assistance and the upcoming COP15 in Copenhagen as well as get one of the GoCards showing a large, sweating polar bear that had been created just for the occasion., 213059=The Danish Ombudsman since 1987, Hans Gammeltoft-Hansen:, 706467=Scarcely had the report been submitted when Minister for Development Cooperation Ulla T\u00f8rn\u00e6s announced a forthcoming update of the civil society strategy, emphasising that it would be an updating. The primary emphasis of the advocacy work in the 2000 strategy would not be touched. And the updating is fully underway, with the involvement and consultation of NGOs both in Denmark and in the South., 841459=This is also reflected in the number of strategies that are involved in Denmark\u2019s development assistance and in the activities that are conducted. At the end of 2006 there were 15 such strategies, for example, involving the environment, gender equality, mine clearing and indigenous peoples, and in 2007 more were added: for Asia, for Latin America, a revised strategy for Africa and for good governance., 431836=And it looks as though Africa will strengthen its position further in the years ahead. Among the 15 projects that were screened at the end of 2007, seven were in Africa, and together they accounted for 59 per cent of the total grant sum expected., 493021=In the agricultural sector programme, the present phase was launched in January 2006 and runs for a period of six years. The programme supports increased economic growth and greater food security. The programme is an important contribution to the national poverty reduction strategy. In connection with the increasing risk of floods, partly resulting from climate change, Denmark supports activities within the programme, where an attempt is made, for example, to expand the tradition of building small earth dikes in the fields to protect the soil from erosion., 268268=The long-term Danish support for mine clearing activities is highly appreciated by the Nicaraguan government, which in the start of 2008 sent out an invitation to a ceremony to mark the round-off of Denmark\u2019s effort and celebrate the fact that Nicaragua can now be declared largely free of mines., 912201=The media coverage was massive. Already a couple of weeks before the project was launched, dilemma.dk was discussed in newspapers, radio and TV, and the pros and cons of using \u201cwell-known Danes\u201d in communicating information about development cooperation was a popular subject for discussion around dinner tables. From November 2006 to April 2007, the project generated 120-150 comments, articles and remarks in the national newspapers. The project also received publicity in more in-depth news and background reports on the two TV channels, DR and TV2., 446995=One of the factories, Igara, lies in the southwestern part of Uganda and is owned by approx. 2000 small tea-growers but receives tea from up to 5,000 growers. The annual production amounts to around 3,000 tonnes of tea. The potential for tea-growing in the area is huge, but the factory\u2019s capacity is at full stretch. There have long been plans to build a new factory in an area approx. 60 km from the existing factory. The area is higher above ground, and the tea grown there is therefore of better quality., 637616=In 2007, Denmark awardedUSD 25.7 million in support to the Global Fund. The Danish support will increase to a total of USD 95.5million in the period 2008-10 as part of the goal of awarding a total of USD 0.2 billion to HIV/ AIDS prevention and control by 2010., 128618=On the whole, both reports from 2007 indicate that on a global scale it seems that many of the Millennium Development Goals can be achieved but also that a significant increase in the development effort is necessary for this and that the progress has been quite unevenly distributed. In general, it will be especially difficult to achieve many of the goals in Sub-Saharan Africa., 509275=Economically, 2007 was also a good year for Ghana, with a growth rate of 6.3 per cent, but an inflation rate of 10.5 per cent. The economy was driven by healthy growth in the export of gold and cocoa. Large remittances from Ghanaians abroad also contributed to the economic growth. In 2007, the country borrowed USD 750 million on the international loan market, which will be spent on building new roads and railway lines as well as improving energy supply. Energy supply was particularly problematic in 2007 and had a negative impact on economic growth., 238173=Nepal is another Danish programme country that has experienced a period of crisis and civil war. Denmark has been involved in the efforts that led to a peace agreement in 2006. This stabilised the country and meant that Denmark could resume cooperation with Nepal\u2019s government in 2007. Denmark now supports a comprehensive peace programme with the opportunity for the embassy to react quickly and locally. Denmark supports, i.a., voter registration and the demobilisation of the Maoist rebel movement., 237012=But is it actually the case that Denmark avoids working in high-risk countries? The truth is that Denmark is more active in fragile states than many probably think. On average, the OECD countries gave 25 per cent of their assistance to fragile states in 2006, while 23 per cent of Danish assistance in 2006 went to fragile states, and this figure has been growing over recent years., 411525=In 2007, the PPP Programme focused on strategic CSR. For example, a brewery that supports the local football club should not expect to be awarded support. The activities that are supported under the PPP Programme must have a clear connection with the companies\u2019 core business activity., 537785=In 2007, Mozambique received approx. 30 per cent of its external assistance in the form of budget support. Half of the state budget, corresponding to 13 per cent of GNI, was financed from external sources., 450359=Armenia is heavily dependent on energy imports from Russia and endeavours in various ways to become more self-sufficient. This can be achieved by, for example, utilising biogas, which is the case with a mixed credit project approved in 2007. The project, to which Denmark is contracted to deliver USD 3.0 million, focuses on establishing a biogas facility at an existing poultry farm. The facility is designed to utilise animal manure and waste from the farm\u2019s 400,000 sitting hens, 400,000 egg-laying hens and 1.7 million broilers, producing a total of 250 tonnes of waste each day. The facility has the capacity to produce 6.3< MWh of electricity per year, and this will convert the manure and waste that was previously a burden on the environment into 80,000 tonnes of organic manure a year. The poultry farm is run by a limited company that is owned partly by the Danish enterprise, Bigadan, which also delivers the biogas facility, and partly by the Industrialisation Fund for Developing Countries (IFU). The project is an example of how IFU and the Mixed Credits Programme can supplement each other., 391945=The support has resulted in, for example, a far greater rise in the sales price on a number of the products supplied by the producer organisations in Potosi compared to other agricultural products from the area. In 2006, the price rose by 13 per cent above the average increase on agricultural products and in 2007 by 7 per cent., 282427=In order to encourage additional debate, to gather together the lessons learned from Darfur and to come up with concrete recommendations for how civilians can be better protected in conflict situations, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark held, in conjunction with DanChurchAid, an international seminar in Copenhagen in 2007, \u201cProtection of Civilians \u2013 Learning from Darfur\u201d, with around 150 participants. The seminar resulted in an 18-page report with a number of recommendations both specifically concerning the situation in Darfur and more generally about protecting civilians during armed conflicts., 880621=The picture is not so quite so unequivocal and positive when it comes to evaluating the national development/poverty reduction strategies that are to create the whole framework for alignment and harmonisation. In five of the 16 programme countries, the embassies evaluated that they were not completely satisfactory in 2007. In three of the countries, Nepal, Bolivia and Nicaragua, it is possible that the cause is that the countries have recently experienced political upheaval, with new governments being installed and they have therefore not yet finalised their development policies. In two of the countries, Ghana and Zambia, the embassies estimate that the development and follow up of the national plans needs to be improved., 34426=This document is a translation from Danish of Danida\u2019s Annual Report from 2007. The text is primarily written for Danish readers. The statistical tables follow definitions used for domestic Danish purposes and do not necessarily conform with definitions used by the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD. The English version of the Annual Report constitutes the Danish 2007 memorandum to DAC., 144401=At the same time, Denmark has helped give aid effectiveness a central place on the EU agenda and is one of the most outspoken advocates among the EU countries of the core principles set out in the Paris Declaration. Thus, Denmark also played an active role in the adoption of the EU\u2019s \u2019Code of Conduct\u2019 from May 2007 concerning work distribution and harmonisation of development assistance., 261930=In 2007 USD 9.4 million in Danish bilateral assistance was disbursed to Somalia., 467746=Since January 2007, Denmark has been the lead donor in the education sector. The first phase of the Danish education sector programme began in December 2005. However, due to organisational changes in the Benin Ministry of Education after the change of government in April 2006, the implementation rate in 2006 was relatively low. This improved in 2007, although there are still serious capacity problems. In December 2006, construction commenced to build a Danish-supported centre for apprentices and tradesmen, and in December 2007 a new teacher training college was opened., 493770=Denmark supports Burkina Faso\u2019s Ten-Year Basic Education Sector Development Programme (PDDEB), which aims to address the fact that only 45.5 per cent of children in Burkina Faso attend school and only 28 per cent of the population is able to read and write. Denmark devotes particular attention to girls\u2019 schooling, which is important for the general development in the country \u2013 e.g. as regards health. In 2007, Denmark, together with other donors, supported a programme where 165,000 more children began to attend school, 68,000 of whom were girls. This occurred within the framework of a common basket fund that supports the country\u2019s education sector development programme. Another important result in 2007 was the unprecedented achievement of the goal that all schoolchildren should have at least one textbook., 895496=In 2007, support for research was awarded as part of Danish development assistance amounting to USD 40.4 million. Of this amount, USD 27.6 million was awarded to Danish research institutions and networks, and USD 9.2 million to international research institutions. The activity area and the total grant funds were virtually unchanged in comparison with 2006, but a number of changes were initiated or implemented during 2007., 519784=In the business sector programme, Denmark supports the development of small and medium-sized enterprises through, for example, favourable credit schemes and \u201ca business development service\u201d, in which advice and consultancy support is given on how to start a business. In 2007, Denmark also provided advice and support to the labour market parties as well as the Ministry of Labour. In its B2B Programme, Denmark collaborates with, among others, IFU, and in November organised and ran a business conference attended by 30 Danish and 70 Kenyan enterprises that were interested in establishing partnerships and which acquired valuable contacts., 918524=Section 2. The Danish Minister for Development Cooperation shall present a budget plan once a year to the Folketing (Danish Parliament) covering expenditure on assistance cooperation for the five-year period commencing on the following 1 January. Such plans shall comprise both the appropriations for the direct cooperation with the developing countries and the appropriations for the indirect cooperation through international organisations and non-government organisations (NGOs)., 177467=Denmark has ratified the Kyoto Protocol and negotiated about a reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases with the other EU countries. In keeping with these negotiations, Denmark has committed itself to reducing the total emissions of greenhouse gases by 21 per cent between 2008 and 2012 in relation to 1990 levels. This constitutes a very significant challenge., 641187=Denmark was already in the process of planning targeted initiatives to secure the appointment of more Danes to top posts in the UN and other international organisations. This was one of the recommendations of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u2019 Globalisation Analysis from 2006. The figures in \u201cDevelopment Today\u201d confirmed the need for intensifying these efforts., 145650=Another source of capital for the developing countries is the remittances sent to developing countries from relatives and friends who work abroad. This money constitutes the largest external source of income in many developing countries, even though the actual amounts are difficult to ascertain. It is estimated that remittances totalling not less than USD 206 billion were sent in 2006, which is twice the amount sent in 2001. At international meetings Denmark has supported initiatives designed to increase the development potential of remittances sent to developing countries, such as reducing the costs involved in international transfers of money., 563199=In 2007, Denmark initiated a comprehensive programme of support to the environmental sector that will benefit both the public and the private sector. The programme focuses on implementation of the environmental legislation, investments in Tanzania\u2019s towns, as well as better management of Tanzania\u2019s forest resources. Furthermore, since 2006 Denmark has supported climate change adaptation in Tanzania through climate-screening of the agricultural, health and water sectors, which contributed to the formulation of Tanzania\u2019s National Action Plan on Adaptation (NAPA) to climate change in 2007., 77722=However, this made Denmark and a number of other like-minded nations such as the other Nordic countries, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and Switzerland take action. They promptly wrote a letter to the Secretary General in order to stop the new targets from being undermined. And the letter worked: the targets and their indicators were adopted as part of the final report of the UN General Assembly on 17 October. Furthermore, all the goals, targets and indicators were numbered so that they are all now fully equal to the original objectives set out in the framework for the Millennium Development Goals., 571733=Overall agricultural production fell by 0.4 per cent compared with 2006. This is due primarily to extensive floods in autumn 2007. Within agro-business, success was achieved 2007 with respect to the support focused on production and sale of coffee and maize. The Danish efforts to rebuild the agricultural sector in northern Uganda have shown impressive results., 224102=The ruling was announced in May 2007 by an English court. Chiluba was president of Zambia from 1991 to 2001 and was well known for his almost extravagant lifestyle, which stood in stark contrast to Zambia\u2019s first president, Kenneth Kaunda\u2019s, more Spartan way of life., 51723=Danish development assistance was examined in 2007 and was , once more, found to be sound. The review was undertaken by the DAC, the OECD\u2019s Development Assistance Committee, and it was overwhelmingly poisitive. The review did, however, contain some recommendations for improvements, to a large degree in areas which, it must be added, Denmark is already working on, for example creating clearer guidelines for Denmark\u2019s initiatives in fragile states., 518714=In order to ensure better coordination of the development assistance, in 2007 the donors, chaired by Denmark, joined forces with the government on a project, the Kenya Joint Assistance Strategy (KJAS), which saw a partnership agreement signed in September. The government and the 17 international donors have agreed on the framework for the development assistance in the period 2007-2012, where efforts will be made to ensure a more effective division of labour that in the long term sees donor countries limit their activities to three or four sectors. Denmark will phase out its support to the water sector and the agricultural sector, but remain active in the sectors for health, environment, business and good governance., 340516=In March 2007, Denmark was assigned the role of host country, and the preparations were immediately initiated for the important conference, where Copenhagen is expected to act as host to far more than 10,000 ministers, politicians, officials, experts, business executives, NGO representatives, journalists and other interested parties., 426618=The B2B Programme has for several years invited enterprises from developing countries to attend the so-called TechChange events at trade fairs in Denmark. The idea is to prepare the ground for establishing partnerships between the invited parties and Danish enterprises. The first TechChange event was held at the HI Industry Trade Fair in Herning, Denmark during the 1990s. Since then, TechChange events have been held at Danish fashion, agricultural, fisheries and food trade fairs. In 2007, 15 enterprises from ten different developing countries were invited to an IT trade fair in \u00d8ksnehallen in Copenhagen. Nine of the 15 enterprises secured good contacts with Danish enterprises, which could lead to long-term partnerships., 200743=Five Danish election observers closely followed the election in Kenya 27 December 2007, an election that has since caused much violent conflict and unrest. The Danish observers were a part of the EU\u2019s Election Commission and had been recruited from Denmark\u2019s International Humanitarian Service (IHB)., 157068=1) These percentages are based on appropriations reported to the DAC\u2019s CRS system. 2) The percentage distribution for 1990, 2002, 2003 and 2004 has been calculated so that it is aligned with the reporting method that has been used since 2005. Source: Most recently available statistics from the OECD. Note*: LDC (Least Developed Countries) are the 50 poorest countries in the world., 999007=NDF Nordic Development Fund In November 2005 it was decided to terminate the inflow of funds to NDF, which is to close down in the foreseeable future. http://www.ndf.fi, 840556=* Section 06.38.01 Multilateral regional and reconstruction assistance, 640103=Denmark sits on the WHO Executive Board from 2006 to 2009 and awarded USD 8.6 million to WHO in 2007. In connection with the WHO Director-General\u2019s visit, Minister for Development Cooperation Ulla T\u00f8rn\u00e6s announced that Denmark would allocate a further USD 3.7 million to WHO in the period 2008-11. The additional Danish contribution should precisely go to strengthening national health systems in developing countries., 108040=Danish development assistance belongs among the world\u2019s elite, both in terms of quality and quantity, and Danish development assistance is generally characterised by its clear focus on poverty and on Africa. This was the conclusion of a peer review of Danish assistance in 2007., 631481=In order to strengthen the interventions, UNAIDS will receive USD 3.7 million from Denmark in 2007-08., 214435=Many new democracies in developing countries have a definite need for such a function, and the Danish ombudsman institution has also been involved in international cooperation ever since its inception in 1955., 314997=In its annual Human Development Report in November, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) emphasised the link between climate change and poverty. The theme of the traditional report was: \u201cFighting climate change: Human solidarity in a divided world.\u201d, 276734=In 2007 Denmark granted \u2013 just as in previous years \u2013 more than USD 0.2 billion in humanitarian assistance:, 301962=With its support of over USD 23.9 million in 2007 to internally displaced people and refugees from Iraq, Denmark is the third largest donor in the area, and an important part of the Danish support goes to initiatives in Syria, especially through the UNHCR\u2019s wide variety of programmes for refugees., 429768=2007 was a record year for the Mixed Credits Programme. In total, gross interest support was disbursed amounting to USD 74.2 million, the highest amount ever. In contrast, the number of new grants was modest. In 2007, support was awarded to ten projects, which is the same number as in 2006. The total grants amounted to USD 70.7 million, which was 16 per cent higher than in 2006, when the grants totalled USD 60.8 million., 78337=The affair may appear to be a case of technical teasing, but it is, in actuality, quite serious. The goal of providing everyone with access to reproductive healthcare by 2015 is a target under the fifth MDG that concerns reducing the maternal mortality rate by three quarters between 1990 and 2015. The goal of reducing maternal mortality is one of the MDGs that is proving to be the most difficult to achieve. On a global scale, approximately 500,000 women die every year due to complications in connection with pregnancy and giving birth. Half of these deaths occur in Sub-Saharan Africa., 104941=Danish development assistance to Latin America amounted to a total of USD 102.7 in 2007. The assistance is concentrated on the programme countries. Bolivia, which is the continent\u2019s poorest country, received Danish assistance totalling USD 34.0 million in 2007. Nicaragua, Central America\u2019s poorest country, received Danish assistance amounting to USD 43.5 million. Moreover, Denmark has two regional programmes for Central America: one for the environment and one for human rights and democracy. The total disbursements to these two programmes amounted to around USD 7.2 million in 2007. Around one-fourth of the bilateral Danish assistance to the region is channelled through Danish NGOs., 525289=2007 was a year of becoming established for the Danish mission in Mali. The embassy is the first Nordic embassy in Mali, and it has been an immense job building up the foundation for the future work in the country. First and foremost, relations to the government, civil society and the population were developed, whilst contact was established to other international cooperation partners., 601960=As early as 2002, the EU and the ACP countries began negotiations regarding so-called economic partnership agreements (EPAs), which are designed not just to meet WTO requirements but also to help stimulate regional trade between ACP countries. The negotiations have been tough, partly because several ACP countries have been concerned at the idea of having to open their markets to EU goods and the prospect of losing tariff revenues., 459066=In 2007, the support awarded by Denmark through the programme to promote human rights and good governance contributed to reform efforts within, for example, anti-corruption and the separation of the courts from the administrative control of the executive., 274559=2007 was characterised by an unusually high number of weather-related disasters in the form of floods, hurricanes and droughts, and this resulted in the largest number of UN flash appeals (appeals for acutely occurring crises) ever. 14 of the 15 flash appeals were issued as a consequence of climate-related incidents or extreme weather conditions., 535911=In 2007, there have been a handful of major investments in the mining and energy sector., 650949=In the period 2006-09, Denmark in supporting AMREF\u2019s fistula repair operations in Kenya with USD 0.6 million. In addition, AMREF engages in broad efforts to prevent fistulas, maternal mortality and complications in connection with pregnancy and labour. In 2007, Denmark awarded USD 2.8 million for the period 2007-11 to these broad efforts in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda., 309698=A special GHD Initiative was created, which until the summer of 2007, Denmark, together with the United Kingdom, was responsible for chairing. In 2007 the group continued working on promoting donor coordination at country level. This requires, i.a., new mechanisms for joint financing and more predictability and transparency regarding the individual donors\u2019 contributions., 600856=The heads of state and government adopted a new Joint Africa-EU Strategy that strengthens cooperation in a large number of areas, such as peace and security, democratic governance, human rights, gender equality, migration and employment, as well as sustainable economic development and regional integration in Africa. An Action Plan (2008-2010) for implementing the strategy was also adopted., 299824=In the period between February 2006 and October 2007, 30-60,000 Iraqi refugees flooded into the neighbouring country Syria \u2013 every month. Since then the numbers have fallen to a couple of thousand, partly due to the improved security situation in parts of Iraq and partly because Syria instituted tougher requirements for visas. The refugees have also begun to return home. Nevertheless, the flow of Iraqi refugees into Syria at the end of 2007 was still larger than those leaving., 179684=The priorities of the Government\u2019s policy for development assistance and the long-term economic framework for Danish assistance for the period 2007-2011 were set out in the plan \u201cCommitment to Development\u201d., 613509=The UNDP Strategy Plan 2008-11, which incorporates a wish for increased activities within the focus areas of good governance, crisis prevention, reconstruction and climate change, are precisely an attempt to ensure more non-earmarked core contributions to the UNDP., 889220=In 2007, the Evaluation Department conducted a review of the reports, concluding that the reports do indeed contain lessons that can and should be used. These should be catalogued and placed on the internet, so that they also become accessible to people not involved in the administration of Danish development assistance. The analysis also came with recommendations regarding the shaping of the reports, in order to make them easier to use and more readable., 91011=This was not to be the model when it was decided to begin the process of revising the Danish Africa Strategy in 2006. And it was not the model that was used, either. Instead, people with an interest in Africa, experts, lay people, NGOs, consultants, basically anyone with an idea and an opinion about Africa -were invited to participate in the process already before the first draft was prepared., 670843=With effect from financial 2005, extraordinary humanitarian contributions, IHB and assistance to refugees and internally displaced persons in regions of origin (Appropriations Act Account 06.39.02) are reported as bilateral assistance., 642219=Ellen Margrethe L\u00f8j was an obvious candidate for the position. She was former head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u2019 South Group, and from 2001 to March 2007 she was Denmark\u2019s Ambassador to the UN in New York. Furthermore, during the Danish membership of the UN Security Council in 2005-06, she was chairman of the Sanctions Committee on Liberia., 902259=In order to support, among other things, the strategy work that the Government is undertaking, commitments of research funding were granted in 2007 for carrying out 15 new audits. These concern audits on, for example, migration, climate change and fragile states., 313872=A number of events in 2007 illustrate how climate change within an incredibly short time has become an issue that occupies not just climatologists and environmentalists, but which is taken extremely seriously by politicians and all those engaged in development and poverty reduction work., 135758=The percentage of the world\u2019s population living under proper sanitary conditions rose from 49 per cent in 1990 to 59 per cent in 2004, and that rate of increase must be increased dramatically if the Millennium Development Goal in this area is to be achieved., 838290=*) Calculated according to disbursements. Comprises bilateral disbursements under Section 06.3 and Section 06.11.19., 373630=Denmark has supported the health sector in Ghana for 13 years, and a new phase of the health sector programme support amounting USD 78.1 million in the period 2008-2012 was approved in 2007. A total of 70 per cent of the Danish support is given in the form of budget support., 140616=In 2007 long-term sector-focused assistance to programme countries constituted 31 per cent of Denmark\u2019s bilateral assistance. Furthermore, Denmark provided poverty-oriented stability and reconstruction assistance to Afghanistan, Gaza/the West Bank, Iraq and Sudan., 485308=As part of the support to indigenous people, a total of 36 deeds to collective land for the indigenous people were issued in 2007, which provides legal security for approx. 15,000 families., 712601=In 1999, the Organisation of African Unity, now the African Union, decided to make 2000-2009 the African Decade of Disabled Persons following intense lobbying from both the international and African disability movement. However, it took a long time before the message was followed up with real substance., 755804=With effect from financial 2005 , extraordinary humanitarian contributions, IHB and assistance to refugees and internally displaced persons in regions of origin (Appropriations Act Section 06.39.02) are reported as bilateral assistance. Up to and including 2004, these disbursements are reported as multilateral assistance. With effect from 2007, parts of the Neighbourhood Programme Section 06.11.19 are incorporated as bilateral assistance in this chart., 321639=The support given to promoting more efficient and decentralised environmental management will continue in the second phase of the Danish environmental assistance that was awarded at the end of 2007, amounting to USD 40.4 million in the period 2008-2012. Energy savings and energy efficiency in industry and new construction are also supported. Lastly, USD 16.5 million goes to a multi-donor trust fund administered by the World Bank. Although the trust fund\u2019s goal is to reduce poverty, the Danish funds will primarily be allocated to \u201cgreen\u201d projects, such as local mini-hydropower plants that can ensure the supply of sustainable energy to up to 200 households., 562146=The Danish support to the business sector has precisely the aim of fostering private sector growth through the provision of better framework conditions, market access, credit access and consultancy support for the private sector. A new phase of the programme will be launched in 2008., 578408=Vietnam continues to experience high economic growth, which has been uninterrupted since the mid-1990s. Growth in 2007 lay at 8.5 per cent, and the country has succeeded in combining high growth with effective action to combat poverty. While 58 per cent of the population lived below the poverty line in 1993, the figure today is 16 per cent. The economic growth, however, has not been equally distributed, and Denmark has therefore chosen to focus its assistance in five of the poorest provinces, where support is given, for example, to agricultural development and improvements within water and sanitation., 857285=Bilateral Danish development assistance has been decentralised since 2003. Several decisions, competencies and more financial management have been moved from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Danish embassies in the developing countries. This was done not least to gear Danish development assistance to the new ways of providing development assistance. If Denmark is to participate in harmonisation and alignment to national systems, budgets and plans, then it is crucial to have both the manpower and the decision-making competencies close at hand. Moreover, decentralisation increases flexibility and the opportunities for acting more promptly in often rapidly-changing situations., 279409=The new humanitarian disaster fund that the UN General Assembly voted to establish and which was launched in March 2006 has really risen to the occasion and begun to function. In 2007 the fund channelled USD 68 million through the UN\u2019s flash appeals for suddenly occurring disasters and was thus responsible for financing 40 per cent of the initiatives involving these disasters, as opposed to 11 per cent in 2006. So the fund is truly living up to its purpose of ensuring faster and more efficient international disaster response., 978044=Cotonou agreement A cooperation agreement between the ACP countries and the EU, signed at Cotonou in June 2000. Replaced the previous Lom\u00e9 Convention. http://www.Europa.eu.int/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/ r12101.htm CSR Corporate Social Responsibility, 618288=The Danish commitments of support are awarded for several years at a time. This is important for an organisation that, with an annual budget in 2007 of around USD 147.0 million, has limited funds for carrying out its many tasks and activities, 95 per cent of which are financed by voluntary contributions which fluctuate from year to year and are sometimes disbursed after long delay., 130002=Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education for all before 2015, 906662=According to an awareness survey conducted in 2007 for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, half of the population (51 per cent) believes that development assistance is valuable and helps foster development. The survey also shows that 69 per cent of those surveyed know about Danida and the development cooperation., 244592=Iraq is not a poor country. The country has the third largest oil reserves in the world and there are many well-educated Iraqis. However, the Iraqis are suffering from the after-effects of years of war and conflict that have forced approximately 4 million people out of a total population of 26 million to flee, and with the fall of the Saddam regime in 2003, basically the entire structure that had been supporting the Iraqi administration for decades collapsed., 849404=The tool box was developed by a special project group, \u2019Team Gender\u2019, which the Government decided to create as a part of Danida in 2006 in order to specifically ensure that women as a crosscutting issue in development assistance was not just about words but also involved action. It was also decided to conduct an actual gender-equality analysis prior to all large Danish programme initiatives and new country strategies in order to establish how Danish-supported activities affect and contribute to gender equality. Gender equality has also moved up on the agenda in Denmark\u2019s cooperation with the international organisations, and they will be evaluated on a regular basis to determine whether or not they are living up to their policies in this area. Moreover, all staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the embassies who work with development assistance must participate in an obligatory e-learning course on gender equality, something that has previously only been implemented regarding corruption., 456026=2007 started dramatically in Bangladesh. After constant disturbances in autumn 2006 with intense power struggles between the outgoing government, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, and the opposition led by the Awami League, the country was on the brink of chaos. The situation reached a peak on 11 January with the declaration of a state of emergency and the appointment of an interim government supported by the military., 328134=160 km of Egypt\u2019s Mediterranean coast faces a somewhat more secure future after Denmark granted USD 4.2 million in the period 2006-2007 to the formulation of an extensive coastal management plan., 222039=Responsible and efficient public administration is ensured through, among other things, an active local civil society that can draw attention to the needs of poor and marginalised groups and cry out when there is misuse and poor management of the shared resources of a society. Therefore, in 2007 Denmark appropriated USD 9.2 million for enhancing the participation of civil society in promoting good governance., 197049=Sources: World Development Indicators 2007, Statistics Denmark, and the Danish Energy Agency, 304344=On 15 November 2007 a severe cyclone struck southern Bangladesh. Cyclone Sidr was the second most powerful cyclone to hit Bangladesh in the last 20 years. All coastal areas, and they include 31 of Bangladesh\u2019s 64 districts, were hit by floods that directly affected almost 7 million people. The disaster cost somewhere between 3 and 4,000 human lives. One million houses were destroyed; 87,000 km of roads and more than 1,000 bridges were washed away; and hundreds of thousands of people lost their livestock and crops., 560870=The media continued to have a less critical profile on Zanzibar, where negotiations between the ruling CCM party and the largest opposition party, CUF, regarding a power-sharing agreement continued in 2007., 905720=In a review conducted in 2007 of Danish assistance to health research, TORCH is highlighted as a good example of research collaboration, not least because researchers in Uganda regard it as equal and professional. The review concludes that the project has contributed to strengthening research capacity in the health sector in Uganda, and that it has delivered new and important knowledge that can be used locally., 508010=In 2007, Ghana was also a politically stable and relatively peaceful country. Democracy is functioning reasonably well, and the parliamentary situation is stable with a real and effective opposition to the government. However, democracy may be put to the test in connection with the parliamentary and presidential elections in 2008, when the sitting president, Kufour, is not eligible to stand for re-election., 903261=TORCH stands for Tororo Community Health. Tororo is a district in eastern Uganda, and TORCH is the title of a long-standing research partnership in the health sector between the universities in \u00c5rhus and Copenhagen, Denmark and Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda. The partnership has been running since 1992 and has under the Danish programme, the Enhancement of Research Capacity (ENRECA), and more recently under the Consultative Research Committee for Development Research (FFU), received support totalling USD 4.5 million. The immediate goal of the efforts has been to build up research capacity in the health sector at Makarere University, and through TORCH. For example, six Ugandan researchers have been educated to PhD level and 19 have taken a Master\u2019s degree. In addition, success has been achieved in keeping them in Uganda after they have completed their degrees., 360650=Uganda was the first country in the world to formulate a broad, national poverty reduction strategy, the Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP). It materialised in 1996 well before poverty reduction strategy papers (PRSP) became fashionable. The plan is precisely a comprehensive and massive frontal attack on poverty and addresses everything from social development, macro-economic management, production and competitiveness to growth and security and good governance., 474737=Bhutan continues the excellent growth rates that over the last five years have stood at 7-8 per cent, and the country is on the way to becoming a middle-income state. Bhutan enjoys success as a tourist destination and earned solid income from the 21,000 tourists that visited the country in 2007. Efforts are being made to control tourism, for example by demanding pre-payment of \u2019travel packages\u2019 that cost a minimum of USD 200 a day. The main income, however, is derived from hydropower plants that produce electricity and which have been built with Indian assistance. A total of 95 per cent of the energy produced is exported to India., 142647=Denmark places a high priority on the principles concerning development effectiveness in the 2005 Paris Declaration and actively seeks to promote them through concrete harmonisation and alignment initiatives integrated into the assistance. This applies to, among other things, the initiative aimed at making the assistance visible in national budgets and utilising the programme country\u2019s own systems to a higher degree, and it applies to the initiative of focusing assistance on fewer sectors and ensuring better division of labour between donors, including joint country strategies in those countries where it is possible. Denmark has also played an active role in the preparations for the Third High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, taking place in Accra, Ghana, in September 2008, where stock will be taken of the progress being made in the implementation of the Paris Declaration., 376957=This is evidenced by a large joint evaluation in 2007 of the health sector in Tanzania. In contrast to previous evaluations of development assistance, this evaluation did not just examine individual donors\u2019 efforts, but analysed the overall health system and the role and contributions of the many different actors: the many donors, Tanzania\u2019s own government, and private sector providers of health-care services in Tanzania., 209628=The World Bank should only take economic, not political, issues into consideration. This is made clear by the statutes that have applied to the Bank since its inception in 1944, and therefore, human rights considerations have not exactly been at the top of the agenda for the Bank\u2019s work. However, the subject will now receive greater attention thanks to several years of Danish and Nordic lobbying., 446139=The project was approved for funding in 2007 with an expected contract sum totalling USD 41.6 million. The subsidy from mixed credits amounts to almost USD 25.4 million, which goes to, among other things, interest repayment, export credit premium and technical assistance., 579580=Among Denmark\u2019s programme countries, Vietnam was the preferred investment country for Danish enterprises in 2007. After 71 initial study visits in the B2B Programme in 2007, 11 pilot projects have already been approved and a further 34 pilot projects are under preparation. At the end of the year, 100 pilot projects had been launched between Danish and Vietnamese enterprises., 868069=However, there is also room for improvement in MOPAN. In 2006 a critical evaluation of MOPAN\u2019s own methods was performed, and it demonstrated that the MOPAN members have developed a total of seven different methods of evaluating international organisations. Together, these methods include around 250 different indicators, a number of which overlap with each other. The MOPAN countries concluded that things can be done better and since then have worked on a new, simplified joint method that will be applied from 2009., 758057=*) Calculated in accordance with disbursements, excl. debt relief. Comprises disbursements under Section 06.3 and Section 06.11.19. The total bilateral assistance as reported to DAC excl. debt relief., 568507=After 20 years of conflict in northern Uganda, peace negotiations began on 14 July 2006 in Juba, South Sudan. An agreement on the first point of a five-point agenda was signed as early as August 2006. In 2007, an agreement was signed on a further two agenda points. The second agenda point addresses the question of political division of power and rebuilding of the country, while the third agenda point establishes the framework for judicial settlement and reconciliation. Following pressure and advice from the Danish authorities, the third agenda point includes the demand for special consideration to be shown for women and children., 358002=The aim of FTI is first and foremost to ensure increased donor support to education and training and thus to speed up the process of ensuring universal primary education for all children in the countries that are ready for it. Even though there has since been a very considerable mobilisation of assistance to education, there is still need for additional funds. The latest figures from 2007 show that USD 11 billion in external financing is needed annually if the goal of Education for All is to be achieved. For comparison, the total global assistance to education in 2005 was USD 3.7 billion., 927071=Subsection 2. Act no. 94 of 19 March 1962 on technical cooperation with developing countries, and Act no. 219 of 27 May 1970 on posting of volunteers to developing countries shall be revoked., 202798=During the violence in Kenya in January 2008. Thieves fleeing from the Kenyan police after looting.Photo: Frederic Courbet/Panos, 312853=2007 was the year when climate change firmly emerged as the number one item on the global environment agenda. But it was also the year when it became widely recognised that global warming is \u2013 or at least partially is \u2013 man-made, and it requires action now to mitigate the warming and its consequences. Furthermore, it became crystal clear during 2007 that the climate change hits the world\u2019s poorest people hardest. Climate change is not \u201cjust\u201d a climate issue, but also a serious threat to development and growth capable of blocking the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals., 859292=From the start in 2003 there was great uncertainty at the embassies as to the role of the flying squad. There was a certain amount of fear that it was to function as an audit unit that was to come and check how things were functioning and report back to management. It has been possible to alleviate this fear by offering sparring, competency development and experience from embassies in other places. In this way, visits from the flying squad have helped compensate for the fact that the embassies do not have as close contact with Copenhagen as was previously the case., 768969=4) Falls under Appropriations Act Account 06.34. Comprises the special environmental assistance (which up to and including 2003 fell under Appropriations Act Account 06.11.16)., 182946=In each annual report we focus on one of Denmark\u2019s programme countries. In 2007 the focus is on Nepal., 511135=The Danish bilateral assistance to Ghana totalled USD 72.2 million in 2007, of which around USD 6.4 million is budget support arising from the government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy. Denmark works to strengthen the country\u2019s decentralisation efforts, with the aim of enabling the municipal councils to take responsibility themselves for deciding where, for example, water and road projects should be placed. In 2007, the Danish support to the repairing and resurfacing of 35 km of a 250 km total stretch of main road from Accra to Kumasi ended, where the focus has been on improving traffic safety. In addition, Denmark supports activities within water and sanitation, the private sector, the health sector and good governance., 552240=Ortega\u2019s anti-USA rhetoric has given Nicaragua problems in attracting foreign investments to the country, which has also resulted in a modest rate of growth in the private sector. In 2007, an increase of 18 per cent of the minimum wage was approved by the National Assembly, but with the rate of inflation at 17 per cent and a rise in food prices, this increase was in reality a wage decrease for the majority of the population., 388828=Denmark is recognised in recipient countries for its sustained, long-term support to water and sanitation and for at an early stage working to implement the new principles in development assistance which in 2005 were enshrined in the Paris Declaration on aid effectiveness. In all the countries, Denmark has campaigned actively for increased cooperation and coordination in the water and sanitation sector., 712913=In 2005, DPOD received a total of USD 3.7 million from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark for activities in connection with the African Decade. Five countries were selected to receive Danish support: Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Mozambique and Senegal. In these countries, a range of different activities will be implemented that aim to formulate better policies and legislation within the disability field and ensure their implementation in practice, and also to strengthen lobbying and advocacy work among local partner organisations, so as to enable them to generate increased and more sustainable attention to the living conditions and rights of disabled people. Disabled women and young people have received training in, among other things, leadership; journalists have been on courses designed to raise their awareness of the living conditions and rights of disabled people; and support has been awarded to continental and regional organisations in Africa to help, for example, the blind, the deaf and blind, and the mentally ill., 262018=A small contingent of soldiers from the African Union secures the airport and the harbour in Mogadishu so that emergency aid supplies can reach the troubled country. But it is not enough. Pirates lie in wait along the coast to capture ships, and Denmark therefore sent a naval vessel in 2008 to protect ships with emergency aid on their way to and from Mogadishu., 987235=Globalisation \u2013 Progress through Partnership The government\u2019s priorities for Danish development assistance 2006-2010. http://www.netpublikationer.dk/um/5889/index.htm, 580410=Gender equality plays an important role in all Danish-supported programmes, and Denmark also had a number of more targeted programmes that in particular aim at ensuring gender equality. In 2007, a domestic violence prevention law was introduced that makes it possible to prosecute violent husbands. Denmark has helped the law come into being and also supported an information campaign., 300964=The Iraqi refugees do not live in refugee camps, but many of them have gathered in specific neighbourhoods in Syria\u2019s larger cities \u2013 especially in Damascus. And the enormous numbers of refugees are creating a burden on Syria\u2019s infrastructure and are beginning to create tension with the Syrian population, which totals just under 20 million people. While many of the Iraqis who fled in the period right after 2003 were well educated and socio-economically advantaged, the new wave of refugees are typically badly educated and poor. Many of them have been forced to work illegally in Syria and the country has also experienced an increase in crime., 843592=It was precisely the great desire to make development cooperation more effective and to better document the results that led to the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness in 2005, which was welcomed by both recipients and providers of development assistance. The key words, among others, were ownership, harmonisation, alignment, division of labour and transparency., 645495=If Denmark is to succeed in getting more Danes into international organisations and appointed to top posts, the efforts must be strengthened and started early. In January 2008, a unit was set up in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u2019 Personnel Department with the sole purpose of getting Danes appointed to positions in international organisations. Suitable candidates could come from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the rest of the Central Administration, as well as others with a desire to pursue a different kind of international career. The objective is to develop a resource base of Danes with international experience and networks and to reinforce the opportunity for embedding Danish values in international organisations., 582858=In 2007, a process began to revise the constitution, in which 500 members from parliament, political parties, ministries, churches and civil society must agree on a draft for a new constitution., 526141=In 2007, economic growth was 5-6 per cent. This growth was very much dependent on gold mining operations, which in 2007 accounted for a total of 60 per cent of Mali\u2019s export revenues. Also cotton and, to a certain extent, cattle exports are important sources of income for Mali., 54100=In 2007 the NGO ADRA, Adventist Development and Relief Agency, initiated a project backed by USD 1.6 million from Denmark. The aim of the project is to create 135 radio programmes telling the stories of local women. The programmes are being produced in the local communities and are to be broadcast on national and regional radio stations. A video is also to be produced in each country, and the video programmes will be broadcast on national and regional TV stations and be shown in the local communities., 61749=Up until now, experience has shown that it is more difficult for African women to become independent business owners than it is for African men. Primarily to ensure better opportunities for more young, talented businesswomen from Africa, the Danish Government decided in 2007 to provide grants to business people in developing countries that enter a Master in Business Administration, MBA, programme at Copenhagen Business School, CBS. The scheme applies for a five-year period, and the goal is to get as many African women as possible to participate. The first woman will receive her degree in the summer of 2008. At the embassies in Denmark\u2019s programme countries, the work of identifying more women for the next round is well under way., 229111=The brutal side of the military junta in Burma was seen once again when it reacted severely to halt a wave of demonstrations and protests led by Buddhist monks in September 2007, and the hope for change only lasted for a short time., 545488=A total of 35 per cent of Nepal\u2019s revenue comes from the agricultural sector, where 80 per cent of the population is employed. There is great potential in tourism for Nepal, which in 2007 had 500,000 foreign visitors. Also in the energy sector there is huge potential in hydropower production., 275633=And yet the numbers of dead and wounded as a result of these disasters have fallen dramatically. This decrease is first and foremost due to the fact that many countries have become better at preparing for natural disasters and integrating disaster preparedness into their policies. Local capacity for preparing for natural disasters is increasing in many countries and the cyclone Sidr in November 2007 in Bangladesh is a good example of the fact that these efforts do work. In Bangladesh more than 3,000 people died. However, similar disasters in 1991 and 1970 cost 35 times and 125 times as many lives, respectively., 270799=Denmark was one of the first countries in the world to develop an actual policy for mine clearing. This took place in 2001 and it was revised in 2006 following an evaluation that documented the positive outcomes achieved. The revised strategy made mine clearing an integrated part of Danish development assistance., 711550=In December 2006, the UN General Assembly adopted a Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. For the first time, the millions of disabled people in the world were thus covered by a UN resolution on human rights. The Convention\u2019s adoption had been preceded by substantial lobbying activity, which DPOD actively participated in both in Denmark and through its partner organisations in developing countries, where the conditions for disabled people are not particularly high on the agenda., 242622=The military effort in Helmand involved approximately 500 soldiers in 2007. Coordinating the civilian and military effort in Helmand is important for creating stability and laying the foundation for long-term reconstruction and development. In 2007 Denmark took part in the reconstruction effort in Helmand with three civilian advisers who helped Danish soldiers with identifying and setting in motion stabilisation activities in Helmand., 331072=The Danish support of USD 4.6 million in the period 2007-10 goes to, among other things, the day-to-day management and development of the four parks and also to the provision of park rangers. Denmark also supports management plans aimed at ensuring that the preservation of the most vulnerable natural areas and the utilisation of the surrounding areas are carried out in a sustainable manner., 60615=The Danish grant has also helped finance women entrepreneurs in Uganda to obtain increased influence on Uganda\u2019s national export strategy. The organisation, Uganda Women Entrepreneurs Association Limited, UWEAL, has nearly 800 businesswomen as members within such fields as agriculture and service, and small production enterprises such as arts and crafts production, and UWEAL works \u2013 with support and counselling from ITC \u2013 to ensure that Uganda\u2019s future export strategy benefits female entrepreneurs. In a 79-page draft of the export strategy from 2005, special consideration for young people and gender equality issues were only mentioned in three short sections. However, there is good reason to believe that these special considerations will receive considerably higher priority in the final version., 901007=Applications can be made for grants to conduct research within all sector fields relevant for Danish development assistance. However, in 2007 the priority themes were:, 647832=AMREF describes itself as Africa\u2019s leading organisation within health and development, and in 2006 had a total budget of USD 47.6 million. Altogether, 97 per cent of its staff are Africans. The headquarters are situated in Nairobi, where AMREF also has a country office, which incidentally is headed by a Dane, Mette Kj\u00e6r. In addition, AMREF has offices in Ethiopia, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda as well as field offices in Somalia and Sudan. AMREF also has offices in Europe and North America, which work on mobilising resources and setting focus on the health problems of vulnerable Africans., 44150=A special problem has been the issue of contral versus flexibility. When I visited the otherwise excellent HIMA agriculture project in Tanzania in 1992, one of the leaders of the village expressed great satisfaction with the Danish initiatives, which had significantly increased their production. However he added thoughtfully,, 617247=The UNEP was established in 1972 and has its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya. The UNEP\u2019s vision is to be the leading global environmental protection body, to set the global environmental agenda, to be recognised as the authoritative mouthpiece for the global environment, and to ensure coherence in the UN\u2019s work to promote sustainable development., 878475=At the same time, work is continually being done to improve the preconditions for receiving budget support. In the area of public financial management, an evaluation is made of such things as whether the rules for public tenders and procurements are satisfactory and whether or not they are upheld. Denmark\u2019s programme countries Vietnam and Mozambique have, for example, reached agreements with the donors concerning acceptable guidelines for public procurements. This has led to the countries\u2019 own guidelines for public procurements being improved. Apart from helping to ensure that something is gained from the budget support, the tightening of the rules has also led, over a very short period of time, to dramatic increases in the share of Danish development assistance that is subject to local procurement procedures. For example, the portion of Danish development assistance that is subject to local procurement procedures in Mozambique rose from 54 per cent in 2005 to 81 per cent in 2007., 534953=In March, an arms depot exploded in Maputo. More than 100 died, around 500 were injured and there was extensive material damage. It was apparently an accident, but the explosion shook the government, exposing apparent poor management of its weapons stockpile. However, demands from the opposition and a large section of the country\u2019s press and civil society that the country\u2019s defence minister should resign were not met., 884265=For example, the goal for Bangladesh is that 33 per cent of donor support should be aligned with the national accounting systems already in 2010. That is a high target and quite ambitious in terms of the 0 per cent that Denmark is currently at, but not impressive in relation to the 51 per cent that Denmark, as mentioned, is now at in Vietnam., 320557=The environment in Indonesia is threatened from many quarters, and illegal felling activities in particular are a huge problem. If the natural resources are to be protected in such a vast and extensive island kingdom as Indonesia, it must be achieved locally. Indonesia comprises 17,000 islands! This explains why the remaining USD 5.5 million from the 2005 grant was earmarked for environmental management., 733713=Africa the largest recipient of NGO assistance, 2007, 374694=This is supplemented by bilateral support to combat HIV/AIDS, which in 2007 was primarily distributed to six countries in Africa, namely Kenya, Mozambique and Tanzania, as well as Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Uganda. For the last three countries mentioned, new HIV/AIDS programmes were launched or approved in 2007., 67940=A number of Yemeni women\u2019s rights organisations are working in widely divergent ways to promote gender equality, and many of them receive support from Denmark. For example, during the period between 2004 and 2008, Denmark is granting USD 1.5 million to local women\u2019s rights organisations through the National Women\u2019s Committee in Yemen and through the British NGO Oxfam\u2019s department in Yemen. Among the activities that receive support are a national campaign against early marriages in collaboration with a network of 15 local women\u2019s rights NGOs and a local radio station, microcredits to women, and research into gender-equality-related issues at Sanas University., 63895=The fatality dramatically illustrates that female genital mutilation is still widespread, despite the law from 1996 and despite the fact that the country had already established a national committee for combating female genital mutilation in 1990. For many years, Denmark has provided aid to this state initiative and also aid to the committee\u2019s five-year plan, \u201cPlan Tol\u00e9rance Z\u00e9ro\u201d, which is trying to attack the problem of female genital mutilation on all levels through, for example, information campaigns and research. Apart from this, since April 2007, Denmark has also provided aid to a three-year project intended to intensify the work of a selected group of NGOs in their fight against female genital mutilation., 508992=In January 2007, Ghana took over the presidency of the African Union for 12 months, which helped draw positive attention to Ghana. 2007 was also the year when Ghana, as the first African country, was able to celebrate 50 years of independence., 287073=A broad belt of Africa, from Ethiopia in the east to Ghana in the west, was hit by extreme flooding in 2007. In Uganda alone approximately 300,000 people were affected. Fertile and green areas were hit by such massive downpours that crops that had been planted earlier in the year were flooded or simply washed away. In many places the water supply was destroyed and worsened sanitary conditions led to dramatic increases in the occurrences of contagious diseases., 248027=The Peacebuilding Commission has been described as the most concrete result of Denmark\u2019s membership of the UN Security Council in 2005-2006. It was adopted in 2005 after Denmark had actively laid the groundwork, and began its operations in 2006, in part with a support commitment from Denmark totalling USD 9.2 million., 493591=Within the water sector, Denmark financed a total of 364 well drillings in 2007, which led almost 111,000 more people in rural areas to gain access to safe drinking water., 542592=The peace agreement between the seven democratic parties (Seven-Party Alliance) that was signed in November 2006 proved difficult to implement in 2007. The planned elections that are an important precondition for the peace process were postponed twice. The lack of progress in Nepal\u2019s peace process stems from the fact that the year was characterised by the polarisation between Maoists on the one side and the Nepali Congress on the other side. On 18 September 2007, the Maoists resigned from the government after demanding that a republic be pronounced before the election to the Constituent Assembly. The Maoists\u2019 demand led to a political deadlock in Nepal, leading the government to cancel the planned election on 22 November., 319475=In 2005, a total of USD 16.5 million was allocated to the programme, of which USD 11.0 million was earmarked for reconstruction in Aceh. The funds were awarded through a multi-donor trust fund and used to finance the Indonesian government\u2019s reconstruction plan. Denmark participated actively in the efforts to establish the trust fund and secured a seat on the board. The trust fund received a total of almost USD 70 million from a wide range of donors, and Denmark\u2019s seat on the board gave good opportunities to strengthen the environmental focus in the reconstruction efforts., 473694=The democratic process was set in motion by the previous National Assembly, which passed a number of laws in 2007 \u2013 including a municipal reform programme, a skeleton law for civil society (NGOs) and an environmental protection law. The process has been made ready for the next stage and has been driven by Bhutan\u2019s former 4th king and the present 28-year-old 5th king, Jigme Khesar Wangchuck, who took over the throne in 2006., 619180=The UNEP also contributes to providing the environmental foundation under the Millennium Development Goals, particularly, of course, in relation to MDG 7 on sustainable development. The UNEP also keeps an eye on the more specific environmental protection goals adopted at the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002., 245583=In February 2007 the Danish Government decided to bring the Danish battalion in the Basra area in southern Iraq home in August 2007. The battalion was replaced by a helicopter unit, which was stationed in the Basra area until December 2007. At the same time it was decided to reorganise the Danish reconstruction assistance in the country. Up until then, the assistance had been concentrated specifically on southern Iraq. In the future the Danish efforts are to be aimed at capacity building on the national level in Baghdad.}",

After constant disturbances in autumn 2006 with intense power struggles between the outgoing government, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, and the opposition led by the Awami League, the country was on the brink of chaos. The situation reached a peak on 11 January with the declaration of a state of emergency and the appointment of an interim government supported by the military. Since then, things have been calm, and the interim government has made concerted efforts to implement institutional reforms. The Election Commission and the Anti-Corruption Commission have been restructured and now function efficiently. The interim government has also declared that it intends to establish a long-awaited National Human Rights Commission. In the middle of the year, it was decided that elections were to be held in 2008, with the aim of giving Bangladesh a fresh start. The interim government has taken important steps to separate the executive from the judiciary. However, this is a slow process. The same applies to the fight against corruption, which is absolutely essential in order for Bangladesh to proceed with the implementation of necessary reforms. And progress has been made. Both business executives and politicians, including the leaders of the two largest parties, are facing prosecution for alleged corruption, something which would have been unthinkable under the former government.
