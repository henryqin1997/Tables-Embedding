A product of the expensive, picture-perfect pastures at Merchant Taylors' school he then continued his cricket development while studying Economics at Loughborough University. He has been through Middlesex's youth system and his cricketing hero is Murali Kartik. He made his first-class debut against Oxford MCCU in 2010 and his one-day debut in the same season against the Australians. However, with Ollie Rayner having arrived from Sussex his chances were limited and it was not until 2014 that Patel found more regular opportunities - especially in Twenty20 where he enjoyed a productive season despite Middlesex's poor form. With England desperately searching for spin-bowling answers, he was handed an England Lions call-up that season. But he proved much less effective in the Championship, taking ten wickets at 64.70 apiece in 2014.
