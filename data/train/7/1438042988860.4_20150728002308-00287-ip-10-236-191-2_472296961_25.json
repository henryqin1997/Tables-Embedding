Computer-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by the system 2000. By way of example, and not limitation, computer-readable media might comprise computer storage media and communication media., 173526=System 2000 may also contain a communications connection(s) 2012 that allow the system to communicate with other devices. The communications connection(s) 2012 is an example of communication media. Communication media typically embodies computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media. The term \u201cmodulated data signal\u201d means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media. The term computer readable media as used herein includes both storage media and communication media., 174504=In accordance with an embodiment, the system 2000 includes peripheral devices, such as input device(s) 2014 and/or output device(s) 2016. Exemplary input devices 2014 include, without limitation, keyboards, computer mice, pens, or styluses, voice input devices, tactile input devices and the like. Exemplary output device(s) 2016 include, without limitation, devices such as displays, speakers, and printers. For the purposes of this invention, the display is a primary output device. Each of these devices is well know in the art and, therefore, not described in detail herein., 172596=Computer storage media includes volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. Memory 2004, removable storage 2008, and non-removable storage 2010 are all examples of computer storage media., 173020=Computer storage media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can accessed by system 2000. Any such computer storage media may be part of system 2000., 25874=This patent application claims priority to U.S. Patent Application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The various embodiments described above are provided by way of illustration only and should not be construed to limit the invention. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize various modifications and changes that may be made to the present invention without following the example embodiments and applications illustrated and described herein, and without departing from the true spirit and scope of the present invention, which is set forth in the following claims. As discussed above, XAD offers progressive levels of abstraction to assist in design, strong typing, a high degree of static checking, and a high degree of extensibility. XAD also allows manipulation of heterogeneous data. With the computing environment in mind, the previous figures were described with reference to logical operations being performed to implement processes embodying various embodiments of the present invention. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, these logical operations are implemented (1) as a sequence of computer implemented steps or program modules running on a computing system and/or (2) as interconnected machine logic circuits or circuit modules within the computing system. The implementation is a matter of choice dependent on the performance requirements of the computing system implementing the invention. Accordingly, the logical operations making up the embodiments of the present invention described herein are referred to variously as operations, structural devices, acts or modules. It",
