The number of international students choosing Canada as a study destination has been on the rise in recent years. In 2011, 98 378 international students entered Canada, an increase of 34% since 2007. A 2010 study commissioned by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada found international students contributed more than $6.5 billion to the Canadian economy in 2008. Despite these successes, the International Student Program continues to be vulnerable to fraud and abuse from those who would exploit either study permit holders or the program itself for personal gain. An evaluation of the International Student Program released by CIC in 2010 concluded that gaps in the Department\u2019s regulatory and policy framework leave the International Student Program vulnerable to potential misuse., 17474=Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to section 127 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, Disposal at Sea Permit No. 4543-2-03550 authorizing the loading for disposal and the disposal of waste or other matter at sea is approved., 10333=15.2.
