    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{58436=The invention uses three forms of amorphous silica-silica gel, precipitated silica and fumed silica. Synthetic amorphous silica (CAS #7631-86-9), a form of silicon dioxide (SiO2) is manufactured, thus differentiating it from naturally occurring amorphous silica, e.g. diatomaceous earth. As a manmade product, it is greater than 95% pure amorphous silica whereas naturally occurring amorphous silica also contains crystalline forms of silica. Amorphous silica can be further divided into two forms that are characterized by their distinct manufacturing processes\u2014wet process silica (CAS #112926-00-8) which includes precipitated silica and silica gel, and thermal process silica (CAS #112945-52-5) which includes fumed or pyrogenic silica. Fumed silica is essentially non-porous whereas precipitated silica contains some micropores (>0.3 \u03bcm) and silica gel is highly porous and contains macro-, meso-, and micro-pores offering a pore size range from 0.0001 to 1 \u03bcm. Pore size is defined as the pore width measured as the diameter of the cylindrical pore or distance between opposite walls of the slit. Fumed silica is commercially manufactured by Degussa Corporation (Areosil) and Cabot Corporation (Cab-O-Sil). Silica gel is manufactured by W.R. Grace (Davisil) and Merck Chemicals., 61457=One class of useful polymers is polyolefins, including polyethylene, polypropylene and related copolymers and terpolymers. In some embodiments of the mixture of a substituted CD or a polymer with pendent CD moiety can be used or blended with an unmodified polyolefin resin. In these embodiments, the unmodified thermoplastic resin can have a melt index of about 0.5 to 1800 g-10 min\u22121, and the modified polymer can be derived from a polymer having a melt index of about 0.7 to 1,500 g-10 min\u22121, or about 1 to 1,200 g-10 min\u22121. Another class of useful polymers is polyesters. Polyesters are a generally useful class of polymers from which many containers, nonwoven fabrics, and various other articles are made. Uses of polyesters include applications set forth in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/163,817. One useful polyester material that can be incorporated into a blend with, or topically coated with the invention is polylactic acid, or polylactide (PLA). PLA is a biodegradable, thermoplastic, aliphatic polyester derived from renewable resources and having a general repeat unit of \u2014CH(R)\u2014C(O)\u2014O\u2014. It is most commonly formed from starting materials such as corn starch or sugarcane. Bacterial fermentation is used to produce lactic acid, which is oligomerized and then catalytically dimerized to make a lactide monomer for ring-opening polymerization. It can be easily produced in a high molecular weight form through ring-opening polymerization using most commonly a stannous octoate or tin (II) chloride ring opening catalyst. PLA can be processed like most thermoplastics into fiber (for example using conventional melt spinning processes) and film. NatureWorks LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cargill Corporation, produces PLA under the trade name NatureWorks polymer. Other companies from which PLA can be obtained include Toyota (Japan), Hycail (The Netherlands), and Galactic (Belgium).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes The specification, figures, examples and data provide a detailed explanation of the invention as it has been developed to date. The invention, however, can take the form of nonwovens, fibers, films, sheets, bottles, caps, and other embodiments without departing from the spirit or the intended scope of the invention. The invention therefore resides in the appended claims. The foregoing discloses embodiments of the invention. In the Specification and claims, \u201cabout\u201d modifying, for example, the quantity of an ingredient in a composition, concentration, volume, process temperature, process time, yield, flow rate, pressure, and like values, and ranges thereof, employed in describing the embodiments of the disclosure, refers to variation in the numerical quantity that can occur, for example, through typical measuring and handling procedures used for making compounds, compositions, concentrates or use formulations; through inadvertent error in these procedures; through differences in the manufacture, source, or purity of starting materials or ingredients used to carry out the methods, and like proximate considerations. The term \u201cabout\u201d also encompasses amounts that differ due to aging of a formulation with a particular initial concentration or mixture, and amounts that differ due to mixing or processing a formulation with a particular initial concentration or mixture. Where modified by the term \u201cabout\u201d the claims appended hereto include equivalents to these quantities. \u201cOptional\u201d or \u201coptionally\u201d means that the subsequently described event or circumstance may but need not occur, and that",
