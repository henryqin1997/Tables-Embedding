    "textBeforeTable": "------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------- Legspinner Mansoor Amjad struck with the wickets of Ashraf and Bazid, whose 172 included 22 fours and a six. However, healthy partnerships ensured Punjab's chances of victory were dwindled. Yasir Arafat and Sohail Tanvir stuck around till stumps as the match ended in a draw. Arafat made an unbeaten 56, while Tanvir made 21. Tottering at 37 for 3 at stumps on the third day, Bazid combined with Usman Saeed and ensured there were no early inroads made by the Punjab bowlers. They added 151 runs, before Mohammad Hafeez bowled Saeed for 65. It was Saeed's second fifty for the game. Naved Ashraf made a useful 39 and together with Bazid put Federal Areas in the lead. Salman Butt's 290 set up the possibility of a win for Punjab, but a 172 from Bazid Khan led the battle as Federal Areas forced a draw. Federal Areas 383 (Majeed 107, Saeed 69, Ashraf 58) and 385 for 6 (Bazid 172, Saeed 65, Arafat 56*) drew with Punjab 599 for 7 dec (Butt 290, Jamshed 108, Yousuf 56, Azam 3-133) ------------------------------------------------------------ --------------------------------- However, any hopes NWFP harboured quickly dissipated thanks to a blistering 31-ball 51 from Fawad Alam. Shahid Afridi made a brisk 29, but it was Alam who remained till the end as Sind sealed the win. The foundation of Sind's pursuit of 309 was laid by their openers Manzoor and Khalid Latif before stumps",
