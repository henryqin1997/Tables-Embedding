I used the rosters and depth charts available at MLB Depth Charts plus whatever I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read over the offseason as my guide to set these up as realistically as possible, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a possible source of error. Rosters were set up to have 35-40 or so active players per team, and to get a reasonable amount of playing time from the bench and extra pitchers, to more closely model reality. Basically, no players are set to play more than 90% of the time, starting catchers are restricted to at most about 75% of the games, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made sure teams get a non-trivial amount of starts from their 6-8 starters. The healthier a team is in 2013, the more likely they will be to exceed these projections, and vice versa., 10806=CBS Sports: Yankees have 11-run inning, end with 21 runs: By the numbers (59 Comments - 7/29/2015 6:19:55 pm), 7711=MLBTR: Yankees To Promote Luis Severino (25 Comments - 8/2/2015 2:32:56 am), 193537=1) Get 2012 projections.\u00a0 In this case I\u2019m using the average of the 2012 MLB projection blowout that I ran at the beginning of April. 2) Estimate revised team strength.\u00a0 For now, this is just a basic weighted average of the team\u2019s projections heading into the year and their Pythagenpat performance to this point.\u00a0 I\u2019m not making any adjustments for injuries/roster changes/etc., yet,\u00a0 although as we get deeper into the season I\u2019ll probably do that. 3) Run the rest of the 2012 MLB season through my Monte Carlo simulator and see what happens.\u00a0 This includes a variable that alters team strength in each iteration to account for things that projections can\u2019t account for., 309472=I\u2019m releasing CAIRO 2012 v 0.3 today which mainly fixes a problem with a handful of pitchers like Alexi Ogando and Ross Ohlendorf and moves players to new teams where applicable.\u00a0 I figure it\u2019d be a good time to run some projected standings even though they are too early to be of any real value., 61096=4) These are NOT my predictions. These are projections based on running a computer simulation hundreds of thousands of times with projection data that is inherently limited. If your favorite team doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t project well, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame me, blame the computers and spreadsheets that projected them. I guess you can blame me for the CAIRO results if you want, otherwise you can take heart in the 2006 Tigers projecting to win 80, the 2010 Giants projecting to go 81-81 or the 2012 Orioles projecting to win 70 games.\u00a0 These are not meant to tell you how the season is going to play out.\u00a0 I prefer to think of them more as a starting point for discussion, with a range of something like 10 wins in either direction based on how things actually end up playing out.\u00a0 You can look at them and argue about why you think some teams will be better or worse., 57613=2005 2006 2007 2008 Pt 1 2008 Pt 2 2009 AL 2009 NL 2010 AL 2010 NL 2011 AL 2011 NL 2012, 298126=Because Marcel regresses more heavily than other projections and because it assumes every one who hasn\u2019t played in MLB projects as league average, you see a tighter spread here than you\u2019ll see in other projected standings.\u00a0 The standard deviation for team wins in my last CAIRO projections was about 9.\u00a0 In this version it\u2019s 7.1.\u00a0 That may be more realistic if you think about how little we really know about how good/bad players and teams are, even though what will actually happen in 2012 will show a much bigger spread more in line with other projected standings., 225485=I\u2019ve uploaded the final pre-season 2012 CAIRO projections and projected standings.\u00a0 They can be downloaded here., 252236=I\u2019ve uploaded the latest version of the 2012 MLB CAIRO projections.

Out with a groin strain, he says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s feeling well enough to pitch as long as he needs to and thinks the time off might have been more beneficial to his left arm than the groin. ... Gardner was sore a day after he had four at-bats in a three-inning simulated game and was being kept off the field Monday. The speedy outfielder has already had two setbacks in his recovery from a strained elbow that has sidelined him since April 18., 8033=Yankees (57-44) @ White Sox (49-51) , Friday July 31, 2015 , 8:10 PM (56 Comments - 8/1/2015 2:03:16 am), 310303=2) It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to construct meaningful rosters for a lot of teams, so these projections will favor the teams that have essentially completed their 2012 rosters., 8420=MLB Trade Rumors: Yankees Pursuing Craig Kimbrel;
