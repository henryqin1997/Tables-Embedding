Usage Guidelines This command is typically used by an installation technician. Do not use this command unless your satellite service provider instructs you to perform the satellite initial configuration and provides all necessary parameter values. Examples The following example shows how to specify the outbound data PID number:  Router(sat-init-config)# outbound data-pid 3000 outbound data-rate To specify the VSAT data rate, use the outbounddata-rate command in satellite initial configuration mode.
