            "[1] \"Some minor planets, of course, already have roles in astrology. Since these worlds weren't known to the ancients, their roles are the subject of modern interpretation and some debate. So it is proving with Cruithne. Perhaps we can take some guidance from the derivation of the name. The Cruithne was the old Irish name for the Pictish people. In the twelfth-century Irish document 'List of Pictish Kings,' Cruithne is given as the eponymous ancestor of the Pictish people, and it was his seven sons who gave their names to the divisions of the Pict kingdom of Scotland. But the Cruithne was also used by the Irish to describe a group of aboriginal people living in Ireland before the coming of the Gaels. They seem to have been at one time the predominant power in Ulster. \"",
            "[2] \"A further blurring of the name's meaning comes from the fact that some early writers claim that Pictish lineage was traditionally taken from the mother's line, not the father's. So perhaps Cruithne--if such an individual existed at all--was not a man, but a woman. As far as the astronomical properties go, Cruithne is again an unusual world. Perhaps uniquely among astrological subjects, it wanders far from the plane of the ecliptic and far from the traditional Houses; in fact at time sit can be seen, by telescope, above (or beneath) Earth's poles. And yet it is intimately linked to Earth; we know that is peculiar 'horseshoe' orbit is dominated by Earth's gravity.
