The Sheik claims his comments were misinterpreted in the same way the Pope's recent comments on Islam (regarding which see ref) were, as he was only quoting an ancient Islamic scholar to make a point regarding adultery (see \"Muslim cleric stood down\" 27.10.2006 http://www9.sbs.com.au/theworldnews/region.php?id=132253&region=7 ) but his misinterpreted or not his comments reflected both the pattern of his own sermons and the opinions of his Lebanese constituency. According to letters to the editor in response he does not however represent other Australian Muslims such as the Turkish community or progressive Muslim of either gender.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "This empathy-based morality and sensitivity can be applied on a number of levels. Wilber speaks of the series Egocentric, Ethnocentric, Worldcentric, and Kosmocentric, but as usual he railroads everything into a deterministic linear succession (in this case identifying these stages with Wilber-Beck spiral dynamics; e.g. Egocentric corresponds to the Red vMEME, and so on) . It is not that one of these then leads to another, but that all are equal and parallel. I would suggest six dimensions of morality, which all have to be equally developed. These can be shown as follows: Similarly, I would argue that an integral morality, to be truly integral, has to embrace everything, not just all humans but all intelligent and sentient beings (e.g. higher animals, higher invertebrates, and, when developed, Artificial Intelligence), not just all intelligent and sentient beings but all of life, not just all of life but all of nature, even the inanimate world[10], with love and compassion. Wilber hints at this when he speaks of modern morality going beyond limited premodern moral systems by giving women equality and so on, and suggest that a future morality with have to extend to animals as well (I can't find the quote for this), it also corresponds to what he calls the \"kosmocentric\"perspective. But beyond these ideas, and Buddhist themes of loving-kindness to all sentient beings, this is an idea that still has to be fully developed. I see great promise here in the animal",
    "textAfterTable": "Table 13b - levels of empathy and of morality * note - although one could cite examples like radical animal liberation movements and exterme environmentalism, these do not have the intrenched ugliness and hypocracy of negative egocentrism, or of various forms of chavinism, bigotry, or ethnocentric and anthropocentric bias. An Integral Morality that includes, or at the very least attempts to include and develop along, all these dimensions equally would form the basis of an Integral Holistic Society, and vice-versa. All of which again shows how these boundaries blur and why inflexible typology should always be avoided. In fact what we have here is the Collective equivalent of Integral Spirituality, the practice of compassion and kindness for all sentient beings, which at present is only encouraged by a few religions (some forms of Buddhism, perhaps Creation spirituality to some extent, and aspects of the New Age and in the secular world the Animal Liberation movement, perhaps the most profound philosophical insight of the 20th century. Ultimately, the development of an animacentric (soul centered) or sentientist (pertaining to all sentient beings) and biocentric (life centered) morality are the greatest spiritual and moral challenges of the present day. An Integral society, whether small or large, must be built on such a foundation. References [1] Milan Kundera The Unbearable Lightness of Being, [2] Interview with a Canadian livestock",
