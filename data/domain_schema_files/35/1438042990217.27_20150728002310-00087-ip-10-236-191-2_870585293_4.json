As such, it experiences times of exceptional humidity; especially in late summer.[16] The monthly daily average temperature ranges from 32.6\u00a0\u00b0F (0.3\u00a0\u00b0C) in January to 78.2\u00a0\u00b0F (25.7\u00a0\u00b0C) in July. On average, there are 39 days of 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C)+ highs, 2.0 days of 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C)+ highs, 16 days where the high fails to rise above freezing, and 2.5 nights of lows at or below 0\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221218\u00a0\u00b0C) per year.[17] It has an average annual precipitation of 45.6 inches (1,160\u00a0mm), including an average 17.0 inches (43\u00a0cm) of snow. Extremes in temperature range from \u221229\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221234\u00a0\u00b0C) on February 12, 1899 up to 113\u00a0\u00b0F (45\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 14, 1954., 89467=Springfield has several colleges and universities within the city. Founded in 1905 as the Fourth District Normal School, Missouri State University (MSU) is the state's second largest university with just over 20,000 students.[31] For the seventh consecutive year, MSU has been selected for The Princeton Review\u2019s 2010 list of \u201cBest Colleges: Region by Region.\u201d Drury University is a private university with nearly 5,000 students[32] and consistently ranks in U.S. News & World Report's Top 10 Universities in the Midwest.[33] Ozarks Technical Community College (OTC) is the second largest college in Springfield with more than 15,000 students.[34] MSU, Drury, and OTC are all located in and around downtown Springfield., 29595=The First Battle of Springfield, or Zagonyi's Charge, occurred on October 25, 1861. It was the only Union victory that year in southwestern Missouri. The fighting led to increased military activity in Missouri and set the stage for the Battle of Pea Ridge in March 1862, which essentially cemented Union control of the state., 35813=John T. Woodruff of Springfield was elected as the first president of the U.S. Highway 66 Association, organized in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1927. Its purpose was to get U.S. 66 paved from end to end and to promote tourism on the highway. In 1938, Route 66 became the first completely paved United States Numbered Highways in America \u2014 the \u201cMother Road\u201d \u2014 stretching from the Great Lakes to the Pacific Coast., 100698=Formerly, Springfield hosted a fan convention around February every year, known as Visioncon. Since 2013, however, the convention has been held in Branson., 34801=The notorious mobster John Gotti died in Springfield on June 10, 2002, after being transferred from a prison in Marion, Illinois for health reasons., 32232=On July 21, 1865, Springfield helped give birth to the Wild West era when the town square was the site of the Wild Bill Hickok\u2013Davis Tutt shootout, a \u201cquick draw\u201d duel between Wild Bill Hickok and Davis Tutt. Two small brass plaques inlaid into the pavement on Park Central Square mark the locations of both Hickok and Tutt during the famous shootout., 11117=Springfield is the third largest city in the state of Missouri and the county seat of Greene County.[6] According to the 2010 census data, the population was 159,498, an increase of 5.2% since the 2000 census.[7] It is one of the two principal cities of the Springfield-Branson Metropolitan Area, which has a population of 537,631 and includes the counties of Christian, Dallas, Greene, Polk, Webster, Stone and Taney. Springfield's nickname is the \"Queen City of the Ozarks\" and is known as the \"Birthplace of Route 66\". It is also home of several universities including Missouri State University, Drury University, and Evangel University., 35432=Recognized by convention as the \"Birthplace of US Route 66\", it was in Springfield on April 30, 1926 that officials first proposed the name of the new Chicago-to-Los Angeles highway.[11], 90795=Other colleges in Springfield include Assemblies of God Theological Seminary, Baptist Bible College, Central Bible College, Evangel University (known until 2000 as Evangel College or EC), Forest Institute of Professional Psychology, Mercy College of Nursing and Health Sciences of Southwest Baptist University,[35] Everest College, Cox College (Nursing and Allied Health), Columbia College, Webster University, and University of Phoenix. In 2013, a consolidation of Central Bible College, the Assemblies of God Theological Seminary, and Evangel University occurred and is now known as Evangel University., 94513=Springfield plays host to college teams from Missouri State University (NCAA Division I-Football Championship Series), Drury University (NCAA Division II), and few minor professional teams (see below). Springfield is also home to a number of amateur sporting events. The PGA sponsored Price Cutter Charity Championship is played at Highland Springs Country Club on the southeast side of Springfield. The Missouri Sports Hall of Fame is located near the city as well. JQH Arena, which opened in 2009, is home to the Missouri State University Bears and Lady Bears basketball teams, and O'Reilly Family Events Center, which opened fall 2010, is now the new home to the Drury University Panthers men's and women's basketball teams., 99940=A March 2009 New York Times article[36] described the history and ascendancy of cashew chicken in Springfield, where local variations of the popular Chinese dish are ubiquitous. There are several arts events that occur annually including the Walnut Street Arts Fest and the Missouri Literary Festival.[37][38] Also the First Friday Art Walk occurs the first Friday of every month., 77803=Springfield\u2019s economy is based on health care, manufacturing, retail, education, and tourism.[26] With a Gross Metropolitan Product of $13.66 billion in 2004, Springfield's economy makes up 6.7% of the Gross State Product of Missouri.[27], 26606=The 1849 charter of the Pacific Railroad, established to construct a line from St. Louis westward across central Missouri, was expanded in 1852 to include a Southwest Branch. However, after defaulting on its obligations, the state seized this branch and sold it, thus creating a new company, the Southwest Pacific Railroad. (The initial line through central Missouri eventually was renamed the Missouri Pacific Railroad). Subsequent defaults led to the line toward Springfield being known as the South Pacific Railroad and the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad, before finally operating under the name St. Louis and San Francisco Railway, more commonly known as the Frisco. Commercial and industrial diversification came with the railroads, and strengthened the City of Springfield and North Springfield when the two towns merged 17 years later in 1887. As railroad construction progressed, Springfield became the crossroads of the Frisco's St. Louis to Tulsa line and the Kansas City to Memphis line, and eventually the Frisco Railroad established its headquarters in Springfield. Today visitors can enjoy the view from the Jefferson Avenue Footbridge, peering below to the locomotive path which is still in use., 85312=Springfield city government is based on the council-manager system. By charter, the city has eight council members, each elected for a four-year term on a non-partisan basis, and a mayor elected for a two-year term. The mayor is Robert Stephens, who was sworn in after the resignation of Mayor Jim O'Neal (term expires 2013). Council members include Jeff Seiferd (Zone 1), Cindy Rushefsky (Zone 2), Jerry Compton (Zone 3), Craig Fishel (Zone 4), Jan Fisk (General A), Craig Hosmer (General B), Doug Burlison (General C) and Mike Carrol (General D). Greg Burris, the city manager, appointed by the council to be the city's chief executive and administrative officer, enforces the laws as required by the city charter. The presiding officer at council meetings is the mayor. Council meetings are held every other Monday night in City Council Chambers. City council elections are held the first Tuesday in April., 120334=Passenger trains have not served Springfield since 1967, but more than 65 freight trains travel to, from, and through the city each day. Springfield was once home to the headquarters and main shops of the St. Louis-San Francisco Railroad (Frisco). The Frisco was absorbed by the Burlington Northern (BN) in 1980, and in 1994 the BN merged with the Santa Fe, creating the current Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) Railway. BNSF has three switch yards (two small) in Springfield. Mainlines to and from Kansas City, St. Louis, Memphis and Tulsa converge at the railroad's yard facility in the north part of the city. In October 2006, BNSF announced plans to upgrade its Tulsa and Memphis mainlines into Springfield to handle an additional four to six daily intermodal freight trains between the West Coast and the Southeast. The Missouri and Northern Arkansas Railroad also operates several miles of (former Missouri Pacific) industrial trackage within the city., 99191=In 2001, Phase I of Jordan Valley Park opened along with the Mediacom Ice Park. Phase II of Jordan Valley Park will be complete in late 2011 or early 2012. 2001 also saw the opening of The Creamery Arts Center, a city-owned building inside Jordan Valley Park. It is home to the Springfield Regional Arts Council, Springfield Regional Opera, Springfield Ballet, and the Springfield Symphony Orchestra and provides office and meeting space for other arts organizations which serve the community. The center has been recently renovated to include two art galleries with monthly exhibitions, an Arts Library, rehearsal studios, and classrooms offering art workshops and hands-on activities. The facilities also include an outdoor classroom., 71885=According to the 2000 United States Census,[24] 151,580 people, 64,691 households, and 35,709 families resided in the city. The population density was 2,072.0 people per square mile (800.0/km2). There were 69,650 housing units at an average density of 952.1/mi2 (367.6/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 91.69% White, 3.27% African American, 0.75% Native American, 1.36% Asian, 0.09% Pacific Islander, 0.88% from other races, and 1.95% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.31% of the population., 25646=The Old Wire Road, then known as the Military Road, served until the mid-1840s as a connection between Springfield and the garrison at Fort Smith, Arkansas. By 1858, the Butterfield Overland Stage began utilizing the road offering passage to California. Two years later, the region\u2019s first telegraph line was strung along the road, and it was dubbed the Telegraph or Wire Road. The road proved vital during the Civil War, and its most historic connection is to the Battle of Pea Ridge in Arkansas. While portions of the road exist today, the most easily accessible is within Wilson\u2019s Creek National Battlefield., 22330=The origin of the name Springfield remains unclear; however, the most common view is that the city was named for Springfield, Massachusetts. One account holds that a James Wilson, who lived in the then-unnamed city, offered free whiskey to everyone who would vote for naming it after his home town of Springfield, Massachusetts.[9] In 1883, the historian R. I. Holcombe wrote, to the contrary, \"The town took its name from the circumstance of there being a spring under the hill, on the creek, while on top of the hill, where the principal portion of the town lay, there was a field.\" He went on to note, \"This version of the origin of the name is disputed by the editor of the Springfield Express, Mr. J. G. Newbill, who, in the issue of his paper, November 11, 1881, says: 'It has been stated that this city got its name from the fact of a spring and field being near by just west of town. But such is not a correct version. When the authorized persons met and adopted the title of the \"Future Great\" of the then Southwest, several of the earliest settlers had handed in their favorite names, among whom was Kindred Rose, who presented the winning name, \"Springfield,\" in honor of his former home town, Springfield, Robertson County, Tennessee.'\"[10], 69194=As of the census[3] of 2010, there were 159,498 people, 69,754 households, and 35,453 families residing in the city. The population density was 1,951.8 inhabitants per square mile (753.6/km2). There were 77,620 housing units at an average density of 949.8 per square mile (366.7/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 88.7% White, 4.1% African American, 0.8% Native American, 1.9% Asian, 0.2% Pacific Islander, 1.2% from other races, and 3.2% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.7% of the population., 30707=Two years after the war ended, Springfield National Cemetery was created. The dead of both the North and the South were interred there, though separated by a low stone wall (later removed). In 1960, the National Park Service, recognizing the significance of the 1861 battle, designated Wilson's Creek National Battlefield. The 1,750-acre (7.1\u00a0km2) battlefield near Republic remains largely unchanged and stands as one of the most historically pristine battle sites in the country. The Springfield area is often referred to as: \"Where the South Begins\"., 30097=For the next year, possession of the city seesawed. Then on January 8, 1863, Confederate forces under Gen. John S. Marmaduke advanced toward the town square and the Second Battle of Springfield ensued. As evening approached, the Confederates withdrew. The next morning, Gen. Marmaduke sent a message to Union forces asking for proper burials for Confederate casualties. The city would stay under Union control until the end of the war., 118268=In mid-November 2013, the city began discussing plans to upgrade sections of Scholastic Freeway(Highway 65) and James River Freeway(Highway 60) through the city to Interstate 244. These plans are currently being discussed and the main reason is to minimize confusion should there be an incident on I-44 as a detour route., 80825=According to the Springfield Area Chamber of Commerce,[29] the top 2014 employers in the metro area are:, 124627=In 2008, America's Promise Alliance ranked Springfield among its \"100 Best Communities for Young People\" for the third year in a row,[44] and on June 11, 2009 Next Generation Consulting ranked Springfield 17th on its \"Next Cities\" list.[45] In 2008 Best Life ranked Springfield the 10th worst city in the nation in which to raise a family using information from the U.S. Census Bureau, National Center for Education Statistics, FBI, American Alliance of Museums, National Center for Health Statistics, and American Bar Association.[46], 118916=Springfield-Branson National Airport (SGF) serves the city with direct flights to 10 cities with multiple daily flights. It is the principal air gateway to the Springfield region. The Downtown Airport is also a public use airport located near downtown. In May 2009, the Springfield-Branson airport opened its new passenger terminal. Financing included $97 million in revenue bonds issued by the airport and $20 million of discretionary federal aviation funds, with no city taxes used. The new building includes 275,000 square feet (25,500\u00a0m2), 10 gates (expandable to 60) and 1,826 parking spaces. Direct connections from Springfield are available to Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Las Vegas, Orlando, Phoenix, Ft. Meyers, Tampa and Los Angeles. No international flights currently have regular service into Springfield-Branson, but it does serve international charters., 125654=In 2007, The Milken Institute ranked Springfield as a \"Best Performing City\" for creating and sustaining jobs,[47] and Expansion Management magazine listed Springfield among \"Top 20 Mid-Sized Metros for Recruitment and Attraction.\"[48] Also that year, the World Health Organization designated Springfield as a \"Safe Community\";[49] and in 2008, Worldwide ERC named Springfield among \"The Best Cities for Relocating Families.\"[50] According to the Springfield News-Leader, the city has been ranked the second-least diverse city in the United States.[51], 24496=Springfield was incorporated in 1838. That same year, Cherokee Native Americans were forcibly removed by the U.S. government from their homelands in Tennessee, Alabama, North Carolina and Georgia to the \u201cIndian Territory.\u201d Their route became known as the Trail of Tears due to the thousands of Cherokee deaths on the journey and as a result of the relocation. The Trail of Tears passed through the Springfield area via what is known today as the Old Wire Road. The Trail of Tears National Historic Trail auto tour route is along Interstate 44 westward to US 160 (West By-pass in Springfield) and westward along US 60., 33310=On April 14, 1906, a mob broke into the town jail, then lynched two black men: Horace Duncan and Fred Coker, for allegedly sexually assaulting Mina Edwards, a white woman. Later they returned to the jail and lynched another black man, Will Allen, accused of murder. The victims were hanged and burned by a mob more than 2,000 strong in the town square. The men were hanged on the town square from the Gottfried Tower which held a replica of the Statue of Liberty. Judge Azariah W. Lincoln called for a grand jury. The proceedings were covered in both the New York and Los Angeles Times. In the immediate aftermath, two commemorative coins were reportedly issued. Evidence suggests that all three men were innocent, including testimony from Duncan's and Coker's employer. The lynching sparked a mass exodus of African-Americans from the area, who still remain a small minority demographic in Springfield. A plaque on the southeast corner of the square serves as reminder., 20437=The territory known as Missouri was included in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. Soon after, the Delaware Native Americans received treaty land where Springfield\u2019s Sequiota Park and the antique stores of its Galloway Village stand today. To the west, 500 Kickapoo Native Americans built wickiups on the prairie that still bears their name. Missouri became a state on August 10, 1821, and in 1833 the legislature designated most of the southern portion a single county. It was named for American Revolutionary War General Nathanael Greene, largely through a campaign by Springfield's founder, John Polk Campbell, to honor a man he admired. A Tennessee homesteader, Campbell announced his claim in 1829. Springfield was officially founded in 1830 and later incorporated in 1838.[8], 45207=According to a 2007 story in Forbes magazine's list of \"America's Wildest Weather Cities\" and the Weather Variety Index, Springfield is the city with the most varied weather in the United States. This can be confirmed by the thousands of citizens living there who experience extreme temperature changes just overnight. In fact in the May of 2013, Springfield experienced a day where the day started out humid and in the high 70s, and by 3 pm there was a thin sheet of snow covering the ground. [18][19], 102686=During the 1950s, Springfield ranked third in the U.S. for originating network television programs behind New York and Hollywood. Four nationally-broadcast television series originated from the city between 1955 and 1961: Ozark Jubilee and its spin-off, Five Star Jubilee; Talent Varieties; and The Eddy Arnold Show. All were carried live by ABC except for Five Star Jubilee on NBC; and were produced by Springfield's Crossroads TV Productions owned by Ralph D. Foster. Many of the biggest names in country music frequently visited or lived in Springfield at the time. City officials estimated the programs meant about 2,000 weekly visitors and \"over $1,000,000 in fresh income.\"[39], 28689=With the American Civil War imminent and Missouri a border state, Springfield was divided in its sentiments. On August 10, 1861, opposing forces clashed a few miles southwest of Springfield in the Battle of Wilson's Creek, the site of the first major conflict west of the Mississippi River, involving about 5,400 Union troops and 12,000 Confederates. Gen. Nathaniel Lyon was killed, the first Union general to die in combat, and the Confederates were victorious. Union troops fell back to Lebanon, then Rolla, and regrouped. When they returned to Springfield, the Confederates had withdrawn., 87109=The Springfield Public School District is the largest district in the state of Missouri with an official fall 2011 enrollment of 24,366 students attending 50 schools.[30] Public high schools include Central High School, Kickapoo High School, Hillcrest High School, Parkview High School, and Glendale High School. Private high schools include Springfield Sudbury School, Summit Preparatory School, Greenwood Laboratory School, New Covenant Academy, Springfield Lutheran School, Springfield Catholic High School, Christian Schools of Springfield, and Grace Classical Academy., 106110=The Springfield Chamber of Commerce once presented visiting dignitaries with an \"Ozark Hillbilly Medallion\" and a certificate proclaiming the honoree a \"hillbilly of the Ozarks.\" On June 7, 1953, U.S. President Harry Truman received the medallion after a breakfast speech at the Shrine Mosque for a reunion of the 35th Division. Other recipients included US Army generals Omar Bradley and Matthew Ridgway, US Rep. Dewey Short, J. C. Penney, Johnny Olson, Ralph Story and disc jockey Nelson King.[41][42]}",

Many of the older buildings have been, and are continuing to be, renovated into mixed-use buildings such as lofts, office space, restaurants, coffee shops, bars, boutiques, and music venues. Located within the Downtown Springfield CID (Community Improvement District) are historic theaters that have been restored to their original state, including the Gillioz Theatre and the Landers Theatre.
