The number you see is the average difference between a person's opinion of a team and the poll's opinion. Ballot Math The Mountain West's season-long dominance of this category comes home with a final win.

First up are the teams which spur the most disagreement between voters as measured by standard deviation. From The Rumble Seat, who we'll see later, puts Cincinnati way down at #17 .

Nothing on their ballot is too weird until Virginia Tech shoots up to #8 from totally unranked. But the Hokies did club Tennessee something wicked and the VT vote from FTRS is a lot closer to the poll consensus, so this actually represents a correction. The weird stuff actually starts at #15, where Oklahoma State\u2014booted from the poll at large\u2014resides despite losing to Ole Miss limply. Okie State is even up one spot. Then you've got Cincinnati crushed all the way down to #17, West Virginia up\u00a0three to #20 after the Gator pratfall, and a number of other strange or indefensible postseason moves.
