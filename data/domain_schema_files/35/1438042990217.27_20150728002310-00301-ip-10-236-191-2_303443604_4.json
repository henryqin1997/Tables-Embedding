The Frenchman was delighted, and somewhat relieved, to finally take the top position in qualifying with a last minute lap of 1:27.782 after struggling with the final corner throughout the session: his rivals were both just 0.08 behind him when the checkered flag fell at the close of the session. Zuber opened the session in style, setting the early running while teammate Pastor Maldonado watched from back in the paddock after the team were unable to repair his car in time after his big shunt in free practice this morning, but di Grassi was determined to take the top spot and overtook Zuber on the timesheets when many of his rivals came in for an early pitstop just six minutes into the session. When the field returned to the track it was a four way battle for the top spot, with the top three and Karun Chandhok pushing each other hard as they fought for what is always a highly prized pole position.
