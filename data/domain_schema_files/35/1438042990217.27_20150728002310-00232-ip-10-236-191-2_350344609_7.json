A player's actual salary in any year may be as little as 80% or as much as 120% of the scale amount. The third and fourth seasons of rookie \"scale\" contracts are at the team's option. The percentage in the column for the fourth year is the required raise over the third year salary for a team to exercise the option. If the option option for the fourth year is exercised, the team may make the player a restricted free agent by submitting a qualifying offer. The last column designates the required percentage increase over the fourth year salary for the qualifying offer.
