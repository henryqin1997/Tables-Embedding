To me, it's a thing that's true to Josh's heart. He cares about people and wants to make a positive impact on anyone he comes in contact with.\" Scouts began tracking Hamilton in his early teen years, and by the time he arrived at Athens Drive High School, he was becoming something of a legendary figure. He was also physically imposing, and if he told the others to stop picking on someone, they stopped picking on him. \"It's a tough way to grow up, and you know how kids are,\" Robertson said. \"They can be cruel. Josh took this kid under his wing and went out of his way to make sure Ashley was treated kindly.\" Robertson first met Josh when his own son, Matt, was one of Hamilton's teammates on various youth baseball teams around Raleigh. When people ask about Hamilton, he tells them about Ashley. \"In the core of his soul, Josh is a good human being,\" said Pirates scout Jax Robertson, who has known Hamilton for almost 20 years.

He's truly a sincere kid. Addictions are a really tough thing. I don't get it. Not many of us understand the place he was at. The fact that he has come through it and is willing to use it as a tool to get to people, that's the sincere person that he is. He's willing to throw himself out there. Don't we all have weaknesses, and a lot of 'em? I know that I do. Josh is trying to make a difference.\" Hamilton had another amazing day on Saturday afternoon. On a 91-degree day when a respiratory condition had him gasping for air, when he required intravenous fluids and oxygen after the game, his two-run home run in the bottom of the 13th inning lifted the Rangers to an 8-7 victory over the Blue Jays.
