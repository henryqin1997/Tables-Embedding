One way to mitigate this \"effect\" would be to not look at the totals and average numbers, but compare the game output against the average output the opponent has produced against all opponents. This produces numbers that show you how good your performance was compared to all other team that your opponent has played. It is more useful comparative method than using just total numbers. Offense and defense rankings based on total numbers and straight averages can be misleading at times. If a team plays opponents with strong rush offense but weak pass offense, the team's pass defense stats might look better than what they really should be. This is something Michigan was being accused of due to the fact that much of our \"bad\" defensive games came against strong rushing teams (Alabama and Air Force). stats ranking football football defense average Filed under: 12 comments October 31st, 2012 at 2:21 AM \u2014 Gameboy \u2014 By Ranking Defenses Based on Difference Compared to Average Support MGoBlog: buy stuff at Amazon",
