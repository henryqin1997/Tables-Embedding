    "textBeforeTable": "D. Specification Table Optional cigarette lighter adapters can be purchased from other sources that will allow you to power the dew heater from a 12 volt power source. For controlling several Dew-Not strips from a single source, or to vary the power output, you can consider the optional Dew-Not Dual Channel Controller (Model DNC02). C. Recommended Accessories Special models are also available for use with telescope controllers (DN16) and binoviewers (DN17). The Binoview binoviewer model is comprised of two eyepiece-sized 6\" strips in tandem coupled with a 4\" long Y-wire to a single RCA plug. The Binoview is the ultimate binoviewer optic dew remover. Dew-Not is available for all popular sized eyepieces and telescopes. To select the right dew heater for your scope, measure the circumference of your telescope tube (or measure the tube diameter - not telescope aperture - and multiply by 3.14) and pick one of the models based on length from the table below. For in-between sizes, choose the next larger size of dew heater. B. Selecting a Dew-Not Dew Heater Protected by over 30 USA and international patents (relating to resistance heaters, methods of their manufacture, and innovative flexible, electrical circuitry), and carrying more than 20 years of constant improvements and enhancements, the Dew-Not Dew Remover is the ultimate in reliability and efficiency.\u00a0 AFAB has been involved in the design and manufacture of resistive heating elements for over 25 years. Dew-Not's prices are also about half that of",
