With Jason Kidd and Steve Nash bridging the last generation to the new one, it seems that the throwback point guard is back. Have a look at their career numbers (listed by scoring average): For far too long, we as NBA fans were stuck with the likes of Stephon Marbury, Allen Iverson, Baron Davis, Steve Francis, Mike Bibby, Chauncey Billups, Tony Parker and Gilbert Arenas as the guys that represented the elite class of point guards.
