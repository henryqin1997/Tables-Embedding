This package exports Text.Regex.Base which re-exports Text.Regex.RegexLike and Text.Regex.Context. These do not provide the ability to do matching, but provide the type classes which all the other regex-* backends use. The backend packages also import the utility module Text.Regex.Impl to streamline instance declarations. The 0.71 version has a \"tail\" bug in one of the instances of RegexLike: instance (RegexLike a b) => RegexContext a b (MatchResult b) where which I hope to be fixed in ghc 6.6.1. Getting the unstable version of regex-base also fixes this, though you will have to get and re-compile all the other regex-* modules as well. The versions of the regex-* backends that come with GHC 6.6 do not re-export the RegexLike classes, so the usage of regex-BACKEND is import Text.Regex.Base import Text.Regex.BACKEND The versions in unstable are being upgraded to re-export RegexLike, so",
