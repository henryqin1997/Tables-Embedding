It's been awhile since that has happened, since it originally arrived on the big screen back in July. In the time since its release, it has shattered nearly every record the box office has to offer. Among its most prestigious records are Biggest Opening Day, Weekend, and Week, plus the fastest to $100, $200, $300, $400, and $500 million. The superhero film also stands as the biggest film of 2008 and the second largest box office gross (not adjusted for inflation) of all time. On top of all those records, it also happens to be a pretty darn good film., 35725=January 22, 2013, 35137=February 4, 2013, 15475=Posted by: Draven99 September 30, 2008 in Uncategorized}",

    "textAfterTable": "Box Office Predictions Recap My up and down predictions are back on a downward slide. Yes, I got the top two places right and guessed their grosses in the general vicinity, but the rest was pretty sad looking. Who would have thought Kirk Cameron's Fireproof would climb so high? Not I. I wish him the best, but this placing was a complete shock to me. As for the rest of the chart, I was over in just about all of the cases. I guess there is always next week. Here is how the field matched up: Actual Prediction Title Wknd Gross Prediction 1 1 Eagle Eye $29,150,721 $35 million 2 2 Nights in Rodanthe $13,418,454 $15 million 5 3 Burn After Reading $6,196,269 $9.5 million 3 4 Lakeview Terrace $6,966,711 $8.5 million 9 5 Miracle at St. Anna $3,477,996 $8 million 7 6 My Best Friend's Girl $3,882,912 $5.5 million 6 7 Igor $5,383,912 $5 million 8 8 Righteous Kill $3,709,480 $4.5 million 10 9 Tyler Perry's The Family that Preys $3,125,620 $4 million 11 10 Ghost Town $2,930,904 $4 million Please enable JavaScript to view the discussion by Sidelines.
