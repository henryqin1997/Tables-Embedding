Please see Bernhard Schmidt's iwi wiki[4] if you are interested in testing these changes. Note: report of ndisgen process causing a faulty situation. Description: Wireless is active, but when trying to connect to the network, the screen goes dark and the system stops responding. The black screen can be removed by restarting, but after reboot PC-BSD\u00ae does not enter the boot loader section. The system shows a prompt FreeBSD (Amnesia mode). Likely solution: FreeBSD problem report and patch[3] for \"Unregistered use of FPU in kernel\" panic caused by miniport driver adapted via ndisgen. Note: ndisgen currently does not support the NDIS 6.X API. In practical terms, this means that you should only try it on XP and 2003 drivers. Make sure you download and try to convert the correct driver for your architecture (32 or 64 bit). If you would like to help test the most recent version of ndisgen, follow these instructions[2]. If a FreeBSD driver does not exist, download a Windows driver for the device, run the interactive script ndisgen as the superuser, and see if you can successfully use the generated driver module.
