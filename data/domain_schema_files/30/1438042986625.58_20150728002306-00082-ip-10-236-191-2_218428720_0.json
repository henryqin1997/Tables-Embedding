A review of the empirical literature conducted on PubMed in early 2009 found no fewer than 60 studies, with at least 20 surveys published between February 2008 and January 2009. At the risk of simplifying a very robust set of studies undertaken on different groups of people, in different countries, under different conditions, being asked different questions, it would appear that in recent years there has been a gradual increase in the public\u2019s expression of willingness to participate in biobanks.[17], 62180=[13] An equally voluminous literature exists on this topic, but one paper in particular is highlighted because of its enduring impact. Beecher, HK., \u201cEthics in Clinical Research,\u201d New England Journal of Medicine (1966) 274(24):1354-1360. In a memorable quotation, Beecher described the most reliable safeguard for ensuring ethical experimentation is: \u201c\u2026the presence of an intelligent, informed, conscientious, compassionate, responsible investigator.\u201d, 21264=Studies by one of us (Meslin) in Indiana are consistent with this general claim. In 2006 and 2007 we surveyed cancer patients who contributed leftover tissue to the Indiana University Cancer Center Tissue Bank and found that a clear majority of subjects would permit unlimited future research on stored human biological materials without re-contact and re-consent, and, further, that a significant minority appear to desire ongoing control over future research uses of their tissue.[18] In 2007-2008 when we surveyed women in community health clinics to estimate their willingness to donate specimens for DNA analysis by needle stick as compared with collection of saliva, the majority of the 279 women surveyed would do both in high numbers\u201468.3 percent opted for the needle stick and 75.7 percent for the saliva.[19] In both of these surveys, we learned that several factors modulated support for biobanking. For example, in our study of cancer patients, about two-thirds, 62.6 percent, of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that it was \u201call right\u201d for researchers to use their donated tissue to develop a new tool or treatment for profit, though support for \u201cfor-profit\u201d biobanking varied somewhat with this population depending on age, education, and other demographic factors. In our study involving women in the community health clinic, we found a number of reasons why they indicated an unwillingness to participate, including worries about the use of the specimens, violations of privacy, the potential for future discrimination, and the fear surrounding unfavorable results., 70059=[41] The first study of ethical, legal and social issues raised by PHRs was Project HealthDesign, Robert-Wood Johnson Foundation-funded initiative begun in 2007. Among findings by a University of Miami team is that in an era of social networking and other on-line interactions, traditional conceptions of privacy are shifting, and that privacy itself is a somewhat vaguer concept than customarily thought. For instance, young people especially are far more inclined than expected to allow medical information to be shared by others who are not health professionals.

It is apparently the first documented instance of peer review.[36] Even the most rudimentary data can be of use: John Snow\u2019s famous analyses of case reports and maps contributed to halting a cholera epidemic in London in 1854.[37], 42489=The clearest early modern statement of the utter necessity of complete and easily accessible medical records comes, arguably, from Abraham Flexner in his 1910 analysis of U.S. and Canadian medical education.

In general, the highest level of concern among the public is related to the use of genetic information by insurance companies.

Finally, a national telephone survey in September 2009 sought the opinions of close to 400 people about genetic research and the use of personal information, including specific questions about identifiability.[21] For example, we asked respondents to consider the following question: Q2: If I were asked to provide access to my medical records to obtain information that could be used for genetic research, I would be willing to give permission for use of my records. On ascale of 1-5, where 1 signified that they \u201cstrongly agreed\u201d, and 5 that they \u201cstrongly disagreed\u201d, the responses from 397 respondents were as follows: (1) 19.8% [strongly agreed] (2) 8.10% (3) 19.5% (4) 16.3% (5) 36.6% [strongly disagreed] We also asked this question: Q5: How confident are you that genetic research is generally carried out in ways that protect the privacy and confidentiality of the research subjects involved? On the same scale (1 = not at all, 5 = extremely concerned), the public sample (N = 397) responded as follows: (1) 8.40% [not at all concerned] (2) 14.10% (3) 27.20% (4) 24.60%",
