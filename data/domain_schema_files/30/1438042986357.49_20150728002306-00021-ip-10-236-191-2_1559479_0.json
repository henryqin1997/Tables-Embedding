Although it didn\u2019t reach the absurd heights of Katniss\u2019 two movies, Shailene Woodley\u2018s dystopian adventure effortlessly nabbed the number one spot and, unless something bad happens next week, announced the arrival of a new big franchise.

    "textAfterTable": "\u00a0 With a $56 million opening, \u2018Divergent\u2019 announced its arrival with a bang, especially since its budget is relatively modest by blockbuster standards. Unless its audience turns on it next week, the already-announced next film in the series should arrive on schedule. It\u2019s the exact kind of hit that the extremely talented Woodley, the heir-apparent to Emma Stone and Jennifer Lawrence, has been waiting for and proof that kids just can\u2019t get enough of young girls battling evil governments in twisted futures. Meanwhile, \u2018Muppets Most Wanted\u2018 opened in second place with a disappointing $16 million, which already has some declaring that Kermit and company\u2019s grand comeback has already ended. While that\u2019s not a great number, the film was made for only $50 million and it may have a shot of making that number back if the winds blow in the right direction. It\u2019s rough, but the next few weeks will be the big deciding factor in the Muppets\u2019 fate. There were two other big surprises this weekend. The first of them is the almost-unknown \u2018God\u2019s Not Dead\u2019 launching itself into the fifth spot with $8 million. The other success was \u2018The Grand Budapest Hotel,\u2019 which jumped up 85%, earning $6 million in seventh place for a total of $12 million. If its legs remain strong, it should replicate the sleeper success of \u2018Moonrise Kingdom\u2019 from two years ago. Everything else fell where you\u2019d expect it to fall. \u2018Mr. Peabody",
