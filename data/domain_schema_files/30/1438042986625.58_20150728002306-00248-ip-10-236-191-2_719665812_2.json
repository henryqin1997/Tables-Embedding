    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{35856=When life first began to develop on Earth, short-term variations in Sol's brightness were probably limited to a few tenths of a percent. Many Sol-type stars go through periods of diminished activity during which they can get as much as one half to one percent dimmer, as magnetic activity subsides for decades or longer. A prolonged reduction in Solar luminosity could send Earth into another ice age. Indeed, one such episode known as the Maunder minimum may have triggered the Little Ice Age from 1645 to 1715 CE, when crops failed in Northern Europe and London's Thames River stayed frozen in June. According to Sallie L. Baliunas, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, such diminutions of Solar activity contributed to 17 of the 19 known major episodes of extended chill downs of Earth's climate in the past 10,000 years., 85491=\u00a9 1998-2011 Sol Company. All Rights Reserved., 22787=On May 24, 2007, a team of astronomers announced that the presence of an isotope of aluminium suggests the Sun was born when an extremely massive star with around 30 Solar-masses released a great amount of energy in winds loaded with aluminium-26. The strong winds of the massive star may have buffeted the Solar nebula sufficiently to initiate the development of the Solar System (Zeeya Merali, New Scientist, May 24, 2007; and Bizzarro et al, 2007; and Shukolyukov and Lugmair, 1993). In addition, the high average abundance of gold in the Solar System suggests that large amounts of the element was injected into matter that eventually coalesced into the Solar nebula by the collision of two neutron stars in a short-duration gamma ray burst (more from Astronomy Picture of the Day)., 25016=In a March 2009, draft pre-print, a computational astrophysicist argued that the chemical abundances found in the Solar System and the observed structure of the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt constrain the initial mass and radius of Sol's star cluster of birth to between 500 and 3,000 Solar-masses (distributed among an estimated 1,500 to 3,500 stars) within a radius of 5 light-years (1.5 parsecs). Although the cluster dissolved over the past 4.6 billion years with the dispersal of the Sun's sibling stars into the surrounding the Milky Way, the stars should have remained on a similar orbit around the galactic center. While Sol's siblings now lie hidden among many millions of stars, 10 to 60 such stars should still be orbiting the galactic core within a distance of 300 light-years (100 parsecs). With the launch of the European Space Agency's GAIA astrometry mission now scheduled for 2012 (to gather positional and radial velocity measurements for a billion stars within five years and create a 3-dimensional galactic chart of the Milky Way), these sibling stars can be identified with accurate measurements of their level of heavy elements as well as positions and velocities of their motion within the galaxy, and the discovery of even a few such siblings should strongly constrain the original size and location of Sol's birth cluster (Simon P. Portegies Zwart, Scientific American, November 2009, pp. 40-47; and Simon P. Portegies Zwart, 2009)., 46448=As of November 8, 2010, the Solar System is known to have eight major planets and numerous minor planetary bodies, including some relatively large dwarf planets., 53069=In 1999, U.K. and U.S. astronomers independently reported finding evidence that one or more large planets or brown dwarfs gravitationally bound to our Sun, Sol may be perturbing the orbits of two different groups of long-period comets at the outer reaches of the Oort Cloud into the inner Solar System with the assistance of galactic tidal forces. Calculations in 1999 by John B. Murray of the United Kingdom focus on a smaller region centered around Constellation Delphinus at an estimated distance of 32,000 AUs (John B. Murray, 1999). The U.S. team (led by John J. Matese) most recently estimated that the substellar object (proposed to be named Tyche, the sister of Nemesis) may have a mass around one to four Jupiter-masses in the innermost region of the outer Oort Cloud, possibly orbiting Sol at around 10,000 to 30,000 AUs depending on its actual mass (Matese et al, 2010; and Lisa Grossman, Wired Science, November 29, 2010). While some astronomers have speculated that Matese and Murray are being misled by random statistical fluctuations or the past gravitational effects of passing stars, Matese believes that confirmation through direct observation can be achieved by NASA with its Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) satellite. On May 25, 2011, at the 218th American Astronomical Society Meeting, Ned (Edward L.) Wright, principal investigator of the WISE Mission, noted that Tyche might be detectable as a \"possible low-mass brown [dwarf]\" in observational data already collected by WISE (now being processed) if it has at least two Jupiter-masses (AAS presentation abstract by Lissauer et al, 2011; and John Matson, blog at Scientific American, May 27, 2011)., 13648=In September 2008, a team of astronomers submitted a paper suggesting that the Milky Way's spiral arms have cast the Sun far from its birthplace over time, based on the results of new numerical simulations. As a result, stars near the Solar System vary widely in their chemical composition because a number of them appear to have been perturbed by the galaxy's arms into \"wild\" or elongated orbits that move them far from their birthplace. However, this perturbation by the spiral arms still preserves the orbital circularity of many stars (including the Sun) around the galactic center (more from Rachel Courtland, New Scientist, September 17, 2008; Rok Ro\ufffdkar et al, 2008; and the Ro\ufffdkar team's an animation of how the creation and destruction of galactic spiral arms can causes stars to migrate far from their birthplace)., 4323=NASA (Re-processed 1973 ultraviolet photo by third and final Skylab mission) Up-to-date images of Sol are available from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE). On April 21, 2010, new videos on the Sun were available from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory., 9136=STEREO Project, NASA) Larger extreme UV image and movie. On September 29, 2008, a Solar prominence, that was \"many\" times the size of the Earth, was filmed as it erupted from the Sun's surface (more from APOD)., 15401=In recent millenia, the Sun has been passing through a Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) that is flowing away from the Scorpius-Centaurus Association of young stars dominated by extremely hot and bright O and B spectral types, many of which will end their brief lives violently as supernovae. The LIC is itself surrounded by a larger, lower density cavity in the interstellar medium (ISM) called the Local Bubble, that was probably formed by one or more relatively recent supernova explosions. As shown in a 2002 Astronomy Picture of the Day, located just outside the Local Bubble are: high-density molecular clouds such as the Aquila Rift which surrounds some star forming regions; the Gum Nebula, a region of hot ionized hydrogen gas which includes the Vela Supernova Remnant, which is expanding to create fragmented shells of material like the LIC; and the Orion Shell and Orion Association, which includes the Great Orion Nebula, the Trapezium of hot B- and O-type stars, the three belt stars of Orion, and local blue supergiant star Rigel., 45421=Over time, the Milky Way's spiral arms have cast the Sun far from its birthplace, according to new numerical simulations. As a result, stars near the Solar System vary widely in their chemical composition because a number of them appear to have been perturbed by the galaxy's arms into \"wild\" or elongated orbits that move them far from their birthplace. However, this perturbation by the spiral arms still preserves the orbital circularity of many stars (including the Sun) around the galactic center (more from Rachel Courtland, New Scientist, September 17, 2008; Rok Ro\ufffdkar et al, 2008; and the Ro\ufffdkar team's an animation of how the creation and destruction of galactic spiral arms can causes stars to migrate far from their birthplace)., 17357=On October 4, 2006, a team of astronomers announced the finding of evidence that Sol formed in a fragment (Solar nebula) of a giant molecular cloud (e.g., the Orion Cloud) of gas and dust that gave birth to a large open star cluster with hundreds to thousands of members. According to astronomer Leslie Looney, the evidence for Sol's stellar sisters was found in decayed particles from radioactive isotopes of iron trapped in meteorites, which can be studied as fossil traces of early Solar System conditions. The isotopic evidence indicates that a supernova from a massive star with the mass of at least 20 Solar-masses (probably a very rare, hot, and blue O-type star like Anitak Aa) exploded near the early Sun when it formed 4.6 billion years ago. Measured abundances of the isotopic particle species indicate that the supernova was located only about 0.32 to 5.22 light-years from Sol. Where there are supernovae or any massive star, there should have been hundreds to thousands of low-mass stars like the Sun that were born of the same nebula of gas and dust. Due to insufficient gravitational pull, Sol's surrounding cluster of stars dispersed over the past five billion years as they moved around the developing Milky Way galaxy, and members escaped the cluster due to velocity changes from close encounters with each other, tidal forces in the galactic gravitational field, and encounters with field stars and interstellar clouds crossing their way (press release; and Looney et al, 2006)., 20404=On April 17, 2009, a team of scientists published a paper discussing their conclusions that the Sun formed from a well-mixed nebula containing dust and gas from two different kinds of supernovae. Titanium isotopes (Ti-46 and Ti-50) in meteorites from the Moon, Mars, and in inclusions found in some meteorites believed to be be the oldest rocks in the Solar System were found in very similar ratios, despite their origins in different types of supernovae. While T-46 (containing 22 protons and 24 neutrons) is believed to be created in core processes within massive collapsing stars (type-II supernovae), Ti-50 (also 22 protons but 28 neutrons) should be created, in theory, from the explosion of white dwarfs as Type Ia Supernovae after attracting too much material from a companion star. That these two isotopes from two sources are found consistently in similar ratios suggest that the Solar Nebula was very well mixed or the developing Solar System absorbed a stray cloud of dust that contained both isotopes (Trinquier et al, 2009; and Rachel Courtland, New Scientist, April 16, 2008)., 44749=Rok Ro\ufffdkar, et al, 2008 Larger illustration. The Sun probably has migrated far from its birthplace due to pertubations from the Milky Way's spiral arms (more)., 9989=In January 2007, physicist Robert Erhlich, who has been modelling Sol's core based upon recent work on magnetic instabilities (Grandpierre and \ufffdgoston, 2005), published calculations on how core magnetic fields may produce small instabilities in the Solar plasma that would induce localized oscillations in temperature. While many oscillations cancel each other out, some reinforce one another and become long-lived temperature variations that allow the Sun's core temperature to oscillate around its average temperature of 13.6 million degrees Kelvin in cycles lasting either 100,000 or 41,000 years. Moreover, random interactions within the sun's magnetic field can flip the fluctuations from one cycle length to the other, matching the paleo-temperature record for ice ages on Earth for over the past 5.3 million years, when ice ages occurred occurred roughly every 41,000 years until about a million years ago when they switched to a roughly 100,000-year cycle. Since subtle changes in Earth's orbit known as the Milankovitch cycles can not be used to explain the million-year-old switch in ice-age cycles, these hypothesized Solar temperature fluctuations may be an important part of the explanation (Robert Erhlich, 2007; and Stuart Clark, New Scientist, January 25, 2007).}",

It is a single star although many stars have stellar companions, which is fortunate for Earth life because stable planetary orbits like the Earth's are much more likely around single stars. In addition, Sol is among the most massive 10 percent of stars in its neighborhood, which is also means that it is not too cool and dim. Finally, Sol has about 50 percent more heavy elements than other stars of its age and type, but only about a third of their variation in brightness, which is also fortunate because heavy elements are essential to make planets like Earth and large stellar flare-ups can harm planetary life with hard radiation.
