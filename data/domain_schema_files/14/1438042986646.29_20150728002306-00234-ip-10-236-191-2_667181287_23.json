7/27/2015 5:06:14 pm), 90524=Since I was curious about how the big trade between Kansas City and Tampa Bay affected the AL East, I ran some projected standings based on rosters as of last night.\u00a0 As the title says, this is extremely early and completely useless so think of it more as a goof than anything too serious.\u00a0 So using CAIRO v0.2 and the depth charts from MLB Depth Charts and Rotochamp as a rough gauge of playing time, here\u2019s how the 2013 MLB season looks as of December 10., 31371=But if you are a Yankee fan, like I used to be, this is pretty disheartening.\u00a0 It\u2019s not surprising, and if you put the lineup and pitching staff together based on how they project in 2014 you will see they are about as far from championship caliber as any team in the American League.\u00a0 Maybe moreso considering the relative strength of their division.\u00a0, 278615=Anyway, using the depth charts from the wonderful MLB Depth Charts and includng playing time from players on the 40 man roster who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily figure to be part of the the opening day 25 man rosters to account for organizational depth and playing out next season 100,000 times, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how CAIRO v0.3 sees things as of December 13, 2011.\u00a0 These were run with Aramis Ramirez as a Brewer, but I didn\u2019t remove any of the non-tendered players from yesterday from their rosters., 316529=W: Projected final 2011 wins L: Projected final 2011 losses RS: Projected final 2011 runs scored RA: Projected final 2011 runs allowed Div: Division win percentage WC: Wild card win percentage PL: Playoff percentage (Div + WC), 86515=There\u2019s a new floormat in the AL West, and it\u2019s the Houston Astros.\u00a0 Can they lose 100+ games for the third year in a row?\u00a0 The projections think they can.\u00a0 Houston projects to be so bad that they have essentially balanced out the league difference between the AL and NL.\u00a0 Last year, the AL went 1150-1118 thanks to interleague play.\u00a0 If you add Houston\u2019s 55-107 to that you get a record of 1205-1225.\u00a0 Los Anaheim looks like the favorite here and project to win more games than any other team in baseball, with Texas a strong second.\u00a0 The Angels do have some concerns in their rotation, which could open the door for the Rangers.\u00a0 Oakland projects to fall back a bit from last year, but still should be in contention.\u00a0 Seattle still doesn\u2019t look particularly good, although they should score some more runs this year, which is something., 163636=1) Get 2012 projections.\u00a0 In this case I\u2019m using the average of the 2012 MLB projection blowout that I ran at the beginning of April. 2) Estimate revised team strength.\u00a0 For now, this is just a basic weighted average of the team\u2019s projections heading into the year and their Pythagenpat performance to this point.\u00a0 I\u2019m not making any adjustments for injuries/roster changes/etc., yet,\u00a0 although as we get deeper into the season I\u2019ll probably do that. 3) Run the rest of the 2012 MLB season through my Monte Carlo simulator and see what happens.\u00a0 This includes a variable that alters team strength in each iteration to account for things that projections can\u2019t account for., 56146=W: Projected final 2013 wins L: Projected final 2013 losses RS: Projected final 2013 runs scored RA: Projected final 2013 runs allowed Div: Division win percentage WC1: Wild card win percentage WC2: Wild card win percentage PS: Postseason percentage (Div + WC1 + WC2), 187795=W: Projected final 2011 wins L: Projected final 2011 losses RS: Projected final 2011 runs scored RA: Projected final 2011 runs allowed Div: Division win percentage WC1: Wild card win percentage WC2: Wild card win percentage PS: Postseason percentage (Div + WC1 + WC2) W+/-: 2012 revised projected wins minus 2012 pre-season projected wins RS+/-: 2012 revised projected runs scored minus 2012 pre-season projected runs scored (positive means they are projected to score more) RA+/-: 2012 revised projected runs allowed minus 2012 pre-season projected runs allowed (negative means they are projected to allow fewer), 65012=With all the disclaimers out of the way, on to the projected standings.\u00a0 These are the combined results for all five projection systems.\u00a0 The standings are rounded to the nearest win so if the total W-L doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t add up to 2430-2430 that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why., 7315=Yankees (57-42) @ Rangers (47-52) , Wednesday July 29, 2015 , 8:05 PM (2 Comments - 7/29/2015 5:56:57 pm), 265951=Because Marcel regresses more heavily than other projections and because it assumes every one who hasn\u2019t played in MLB projects as league average, you see a tighter spread here than you\u2019ll see in other projected standings.\u00a0 The standard deviation for team wins in my last CAIRO projections was about 9.\u00a0 In this version it\u2019s 7.1.\u00a0 That may be more realistic if you think about how little we really know about how good/bad players and teams are, even though what will actually happen in 2012 will show a much bigger spread more in line with other projected standings., 59887=2) Playing time distribution in these simulations will not match actual 2013 playing time. I used the rosters and depth charts available at MLB Depth Charts plus whatever I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read over the offseason as my guide to set these up as realistically as possible, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a possible source of error. Rosters were set up to have 35-40 or so active players per team, and to get a reasonable amount of playing time from the bench and extra pitchers, to more closely model reality. Basically, no players are set to play more than 90% of the time, starting catchers are restricted to at most about 75% of the games, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made sure teams get a non-trivial amount of starts from their 6-8 starters. The healthier a team is in 2013, the more likely they will be to exceed these projections, and vice versa., 277475=DISCLAIMER: This is very limited in telling us much about how 2012 will play out for a large number of reasons., 163107=We\u2019re roughly about 10% of the way throught the 2012 regular season, which is a pretty small sample size to make sweeping observations about how good or bad teams are.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean that what\u2019s happened to this point isn\u2019t important, because it is.\u00a0 I wanted to see what teams have seen the biggest shifts in their outlooks based on how they projected coming into the year compared what they have done since., 57717=2005 2006 2007 2008 Pt 1 2008 Pt 2 2009 AL 2009 NL 2010 AL 2010 NL 2011 AL 2011 NL 2012, 8509=NY Post: Samardzija?

These are projections based on running a computer simulation hundreds of thousands of times with projection data that is inherently limited. If your favorite team doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t project well, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame me, blame the computers and spreadsheets that projected them. I guess you can blame me for the CAIRO results if you want, otherwise you can take heart in the 2006 Tigers projecting to win 80, the 2010 Giants projecting to go 81-81 or the 2012 Orioles projecting to win 70 games.\u00a0 These are not meant to tell you how the season is going to play out.\u00a0 I prefer to think of them more as a starting point for discussion, with a range of something like 10 wins in either direction based on how things actually end up playing out.\u00a0 You can look at them and argue about why you think some teams will be better or worse., 10952=Yankees (53-41) @ Twins (51-44) , Friday July 24, 2015 , 8:10 PM (41 Comments - 7/25/2015 5:56:45 pm), 277904=2) It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to construct meaningful rosters for a lot of teams, so these projections will favor the teams that have essentially completed their 2012 rosters., 8927=Yankees (55-42) @ Rangers (47-50) , Monday July 27, 2015 , 8:05 PM (103 Comments - 7/28/2015 10:54:09 am), 57339=With Opening Day rapidly approaching, it\u2019s time for my 2013 MLB projected standings blowout.\u00a0 The idea behind this series of posts is to try and project how the 2013 MLB season might look given what we think we may know right now.\u00a0 I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been doing a version of this since 2005, and you can see the results by looking at the following links., 194875=I\u2019ve uploaded the final pre-season 2012 CAIRO projections and projected standings.\u00a0 They can be downloaded here., 10125=NY Times: Alex Rodriguez\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Three Home Runs Help Yankees Rally to Stun the Twins (11 Comments - 7/26/2015 2:14:54 pm), 9749=Yankees (54-42) @ Twins (52-45) , Sunday July 26, 2015 , 2:10 PM (73 Comments - 7/27/2015 3:17:29 am), 81359=W: Projected final 2013 wins L: Projected final 2013 losses RS: Projected final 2013 runs scored RA: Projected final 2013 runs allowed Div: Division win percentage WC1: Wild card win percentage WC2: Wild card win percentage PS: Postseason percentage (Div + WC1 + WC2) W+/-: Projected wins within one standard deviation, 30462=W: Projected final 2014 wins L: Projected final 2014 losses RS: Projected final 2014 runs scored RA: Projected final 2014 runs allowed Div: Division win percentage WC1: Wild card win percentage WC2: Wild card win percentage PS: Postseason percentage (Div + WC1 + WC2) W+/-: Projected wins within one standard deviation, 108792=Sabathia will make his first start since June 24 on Tuesday night against Toronto. Out with a groin strain, he says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s feeling well enough to pitch as long as he needs to and thinks the time off might have been more beneficial to his left arm than the groin. ... Gardner was sore a day after he had four at-bats in a three-inning simulated game and was being kept off the field Monday. The speedy outfielder has already had two setbacks in his recovery from a strained elbow that has sidelined him since April 18., 8123=Yankees (56-42) @ Rangers (47-51) , Tuesday July 28, 2015 , 8:05 PM (119 Comments - 7/29/2015 9:06:53 am), 89548=And there you have it.\u00a0 The 2013 projection blowout.\u00a0 Results are not guaranteed.}",
