A field assessment of 27 central air conditioners in central California found field-measured EERs to be only 79% of rated values (Sherman et al., 1987). Field tests on 70 AC systems in Arizona discovered that \"as found\" EER was 40% lower than rated (Kuenzi, 1988). A field evaluation in North Carolina concluded that three of ten examined air conditioning systems had low evaporator air flow (Neal, 1987) and seven of the random sample had improper refrigerant charge., 57544=Palani, M., O'Neal, D., Haberl, J., 1992. \"The Effect of Reduced Evaporator Air Flow on the Performance of a Residential Central Air Conditioner,\" Proceedings of the 1992 Symposium on Building Systems in Hot-Humid Climates, Energy Systems Laboratory, Texas A&M University Dallas, TX, p. 20-26., 35618=Significant work in determining the potential impact of air flow on performance was performed in a series of bench tests by Palani et al. (1992) on a three-ton air conditioner. In the test with a 95oF (35oC) outdoor condition, the evaporator air flow was arbitrary decreased by obstructing supply from a standard rate of 1135 cfm (536 L/S) to values representing a 25% (843 cfm; 398 L/S), 50% (544 cfm; 257 L/S), 75% (254 cfm; 120 L/S) and 90% (109 cfm; 51 L/S) reductions. Although power demand dropped slightly with decreased air flow, EER dropped rapidly beyond a 50% air flow reduction. A 25% reduction in air flow produced a 4.2% decrease in the nominal EER (9.53 Btu/W; 10 kJ/W). The reductions to EER were 6.5%, 34.6% and 71.1% for 50%, 75% and 90% drops in air flow, respectively.

These include refrigerant temperatures and pressures to provide refrigerant side performance data, as well as dry-bulb temperatures and relative humidities to obtain air-side data. Copper constantan thermocouple were used to take dry-bulb temperatures and chilled mirror hygrometers were used to take dew point measurements. Refrigerant mass flow was measured at the liquid line before the expansion device. Air flow rate was measured using the pressure drop across a square edged orifice plate designed according to ASME MFC-3M-1984. A speed controlled booster fan is used to make up for the static pressure loss through the orifice. Electrical power for the compressor, condenser fan and indoor fan unit are individually metered. External static pressure was measured with a differential pressure transducer., 58287=Proctor, J., Blasnik, M., and Downey, 1995. Southern California Edison Coachella Valley Duct and HVAC Retrofit Efficiency Improvement Pilot Project, Final Report, February, 1, 1995., 11064=Project technicians visited a total of 27 residential sites in the summer of 1996. The sites were divided between Central and South Florida. The sample was selected and was not intended as a true statistical representation of AC installations, but rather as a series of case studies. Several installations were chosen to allow examination of particular aspects. Two of these were installations where special care had been taken to obtain a good air conditioner installation and another was a case with known problems (coil icing and high bill complaints). Some effort was made to obtain a mix of vintages (both old and new construction) as well as household demographics and system type., 57865=Parker, D., Mazzara, M. and Sherwin, J., 1996, \"Monitored Energy Use Patterns in Low Income Housing in a Hot-Humid Climate\", Proceedings of the 1996 Symposium on Building Systems in Hot-Humid Climates, Energy Systems Laboratory, Texas A&M University, Dallas, TX., 12163=The flow hood is a commercially available model with digital readout and air density correction and a specified accuracy of 5% + 5 cfm (2.4 L/S) from 0 to 2500 cfm (1180 L/S). For systems with a single return, the flow hood was placed over the grill and cubic feet per minute (cfm) or liters per second (L/S) measurements taken under standard operation (wet coil). One problem is that the flow hood will under estimate actual coil air flow if significant leakage exists between the return inlet and the coil. Consequently, this method was only used where inspection suggested that return air leaks between the return grill and the coil were minimal., 55998=Blasnik, M., Proctor, J., Downey, T. and Peterson, G., 1996. Assessment of HVAC Installations in New Homes in Arizona Public Service Company's Service Territory, Final Report, April 22, 1996., 49759=For instance a duct system moving 800 cfm (378 L/S) with a pressure drop similar to that measured in our study (0.63 IWC or 157 Pa without coil and 0.83 with coil) would result in a power draw of 347 W. However, a duct system with a total pressure drop of only 0.2 IWC (50 Pa) (0.4 IWC or 100 Pa with coil) would produce a power demand of only 167 W -- a fan power reduction of 52%. If the compressor electrical demand was 1800 W to produce 24,000 Btu/hr (7032 W) of cooling at the coil (not including fan energy), the improvement would alter EER from 10.63 to 11.91 Btu/W (12.56 kJ/W) -- an 10% net increase in cooling efficiency and capacity., 58482=Rutkowski, H. \"Balancing Residential Air Distributions Systems,\" Technical Reference Bulletins 137-139, Air Conditioning Contractors of America, August, 1996., 56320=Handcock, O.G., 1989.

All supply ducts were left in their current configuration and filters were not changed prior to making the tests. Results Where possible, duct system external static pressure was obtained by differencing the return and supply side duct pressures. This was accomplished using a digital manometer with static pressure probes before and after the system air handler. At one site, both methods were used to measure air flow to verify their approximate repeatability. The results showed agreement of the two methods to within 5% (40 cfm) on dry coil air flow. It is noteworthy, however, that this data also showed that dry coil air flow was approximately 10% greater than a wet coil under standard operation. kh = the meter watt-hours per revolution (typically 7.2) 3600 = seconds per hour t = time for ten revolutions (sec) Where: Watts = 10 * kh * 3600 / t and: cfm = cubic feet per minute C = 3.16 or 3.413 Btu/W/ (60 min/h * 0.24 Btu/lb. * 0.075 lb/ft3) Ts = supply air temperature after coil (oF) Tr = return air temperature before coil (oF) Where: cfm = Watts * C / (Ts - Tr)",
