Toluene is used as a solvent in paints and coatings, adhesives, inks, dyes, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and cleaning supplies, and in the manufacturing of polymers such as nylon, polyethylene terephthalate (PET; used for soda bottles) and polyurethanes (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) 2000c; Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB) 2003f). Toluene contamination of water supplies is due to release onto land and water by petroleum refining factories and other industries including the pharmaceutical, paint and furniture industries (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) 2002o). Toluene is a High Production Volume (HPV) chemical with U.S. production exceeding five billion pounds in 1990 (Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB) 2003f; USEPA 1998b).
