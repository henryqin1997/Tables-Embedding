To start with, its shape orients the load, predictably, where we want it every time. Other belay carabiners can be loaded on the nose of the \u2018biner \u2026 a very dangerous situation. The Jake eliminated this problem through a superior design. It always centers your belay/rappel device so that in double-rope rappels, neither strand of rope is pinched on the spine, ensuring a smooth and predictable rap\u2019. The Jake is also equipped with a truly unique side-swing gate which provides you with greater gate clearance and ease of use. Available with Screw gate, Quik-Lok or the 3-Stage Quik-Lok locking mechanisms. NSN: 8465-01-583-4388 \u00a0",
