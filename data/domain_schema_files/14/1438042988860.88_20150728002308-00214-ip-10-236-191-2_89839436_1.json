    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{3556=The first period started off with your typical Phoenix strangle hold where they gave up very little. At 4:47, Doan fed Yandle sneaking in from the point. He whiffed on the shot a little bit but that worked to his benefit as it went right past a fooled Ramo to give the Yotes the lead. The Coyotes continued to dominate for the first half of the first period, generating essentially all of the chances. The Flames started turning the play the other way in the second half of the period. \u00a0They tied it up with eight seconds left in the first with a similar play to the Coyotes first goal. The puck, after a nice Hudler zone entry and missed pass attempt, eventually made its way to a wide open Brodie at the point. He ripped one top right shelf where grandma keeps the hard candies. All square after one. Chances were 7-6 for Phoenix although the Flames were outshot 11-3., 2086=The Flames kept right on rolling in the third. They took an early penalty which was quickly turned into a positive rather than a negative when Stajan made a great play to tap the puck off of Yandle at the blueline to create a two on one with Stempniak. Stajan carried the puck into the offensive zone faked the shot and dished it over to an open Stempniak at the side of the net who tapped in the shorty. The goal was the Flames 6th shorthanded goal of the year and puts them at the top of the league in that category. Chances were 5-3 for Phoenix in the third, which is a pretty good number for the home team given they were protecting a lead the whole time., 2611=The second continued to be an entertaining one. The Flames and Yotes traded shots back and forth before Backlund took a beautiful cross-ice feed from Hudler at 5:48 and beat Greiss over the right shoulder.\u00a0 At 11:46 on the PP, Gio let go a knuckle puck from the point that bobbled past Greiss to give the Flames the 3-1 lead going into the third. Chances were 6-5 for the Flames in the second with the Flames outshooting the Yotes 11-10.\u00a0\u00a0, 4892=Byron Bader December 04 2013 11:47PM}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{55247=The coach also had a great deal of faith in Berra despite him slipping around on the ice like he's wearing Toms in a Canadian winter. The coach believes a lot of stupid things about player usage. The coach has a good system, but is horrendous when it comes to evaluating and deploying players. When it comes to the scoring chances look who is on the ice for the shifts played by the Ribero line. Always Backlund or Stajan, never Colborne. He gets the easy minutes. Easy competition and nice zone starts., 70968=I thought all 4 centers played great last night. I didn't notice Byron a whole lot on ES but when you play 4th line that is great! Backlund was skating well, pressing on D and more aggressive offensively (the goal was GREAT but the fact he took the shot was even better). Colborne made some beautiful passes (see Gios goal) played well behind the O net control wise and was solid in the D, and Stajan was....... Stajan; solid all round. All in all a great game by all 4! If your centers play well good things usually happen., 104383=Copyright \u00a9 The Nation Network 2012 | Glyphicons Free licensed under CC BY 3.0 | Advertise with us!, 82004=Personally I would like to see Stemp stay and Stajan go just because we are thinner at RW and it would give Backlund more minutes. If the org goofs and trades Backlund, then I don't mind Stajan staying., 81705=Out of those three vets, I think a lot will depend on the players themselves as far as staying or going. I think Cammy for sure is gone. If one or both of Stajan and Stempniak express a desire for a 2 - 3 year deal to bridge the rebuild I think the org tries to make it work for them., 63935=I agree 100%. I'm just saying when you look at corsi, you need to take into account ZS% and QoC. Not just isolate corsi. I think Backlund or Stajan should see all of the tough minutes. It's best for the team, but you need to evaluate both players in light of that. Not bury Backlund with tough circumstances, give Colborne cherry circumstances and say Colborne's corsi is better., 25758=The Flames played a good all-around game, beating a Coyotes team that has had their number over the years. They won their second game in a row tonight. They have only done this two other times this season and the last time was against Montreal and New Jersey in mid-October. With the win, they improve to 10-13-4 on the season. \u00a0, 78470=I thought Baertchi was playing well last night too, I saw him making an effort in all three zones.. but then he was riding the pine for much of the third. Was that on purpose? Or was it because Stajan was such a beast last night?, 72149=IF you think Hartley has it in for Backlund, look at total shifts last night. WRT to the forwards only Stajan (by one) was sent out over the boards by Hartley more than Backlund. If Hartley had it in for Backlund why would he do that??????? Hartley had to make a conscious decision to play Backlund that many shifts; it was well deserved and the result speaks for itself. ( A number of his shifts were SH which are shorter by nature and then the coach has to readjust his ES lines etc to give the PK time off to recuperate.. its a nature of the beast it is more tiring to PK than PP). Play your players to their strengths and I thought Hartley did great last night., 38535=The Flames paid Ramo like the #1... so they will no doubt give im his chances and it looks like he may have some potential, but i am not at all upset over giving Reto the month of november to show where he is at. He cannot say now that he didnt get a chance, unlike many goalie prospects that died in the pipes behind the mater, kipper., 52351=Our pk has been exceptional last while. Gotta think that Cammy Stemps and Stajan are increasing value. Org has an interesting decision about the proper mix of vets versus rookies to further the development.}",
