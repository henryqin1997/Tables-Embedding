Here's a look at the top finishers on the men's and women's side of the event, including the finishing time and the bib for the annual event along the California coast. Isaac Hayman, a 26-year-old former Sgt. in the Army, ran the half-marathon version of the event and carried a 50-pound backpack with the flag in it with the purpose of waving it proudly at the finish line. Among the highlights included a man carrying the American flag all the way to the finish line of the 26-mile race, supporting the relief efforts and showing a great sense of American pride in the process. Racing officials offered the 150 entrants who traveled from the New York Marathon, which was cancelled due to Hurricane Sandy, a discounted rate, with part of those proceeds to go toward the relief effort on the East Coast. The cancellation of the New York Marathon left some runners scrambling to get into competition before the racing season ends later this year. It made for a great showing at the 2012 Malibu International Marathon, where 800 runners vied for the top spot. Comment 1 Reads 1.3K Photo courtesy of: Malibu.patch.com",
