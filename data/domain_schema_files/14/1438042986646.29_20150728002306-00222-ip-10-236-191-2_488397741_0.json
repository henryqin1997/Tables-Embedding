Exercise intensity was graded by a specialized coach according to the progression of each subject and based on the Borg scale. 60-minute resistance exercises that consisted of a period of warming up, 3 levels of step-ups on a stair and arm pull-ups using exercise bands plus respiratory muscle training. Subjects also took part in 15-minute walking periods before and after resistance training. Control group: Did not exercise",

A combination of aerobic, strength, and muscle-toning exercises conducted in a circuit-type format. Both upper and lower body exercises. Participants were encouraged to reach a target heart rate of 60-75% of heart rate reserve. Control group: Stretching (4/week, 40 minutes), 2 days in class and 2 days at home, which included a total body stretching routine. All subjects received individualized instruction before beginning their exercise program and regular telephone counseling throughout the intervention.",
            "Intervention group: Strength, balance, mobility, endurance (3/week, 90 minutes). Strength: subjects progressed from 1 to 3 sets of 12 repetitions over the first 4 weeks. Rate of progression was modified for subjects with physical limitations. Balance training was performed 2/week, increasing in difficulty over the 12 weeks. Endurance training also increased in intensity over the 12 weeks. Classes led by exercise physiology grad student. Control: Continued usual activities",

Participants required to complete 36 sessions of each phase before progressing to next phase. Phase 1 group format, included 22 exercises focused on flexibility, balance, coordination, speed of reaction, and to a modest extent, strength. The participants continued to perform a shortened version of the Phase 1 exercises during Phase 2, which added progressive resistance training. Phase 3 endurance training introduced using treadmills, stationary bicycles, Aerodyne bicycles, or rowing machines. Initially, participants exercised for 15 minutes. The duration was increased progressively to 20 minutes. The training regimen was then supplemented with interval training interspersed with 2 to 3 minutes of rest.
