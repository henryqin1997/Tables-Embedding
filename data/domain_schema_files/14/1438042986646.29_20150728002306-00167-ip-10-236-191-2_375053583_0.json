Maybe I am just getting on my high elitist blogger horse here but the unwashed baseball masses are making a some bad votes here with Rollins (hasn't played since May 21st and has only been in 12 games this season), Reyes and Cabrera. Orlando Cabrera, Reds 487,680 5. Jose Reyes, Mets 493,913 4. Troy Tulowitzki Rockies 702, 165 3. Jimmy Rollins, Phillies 992,887 2. Hanley Ramirez, Marlins 1,190,685 1. current top 5 (as of 6/15/2010) vote getters at shortstop are as follows: The There is the usual shenanigans going on with the ballot box stuffing going on in Philadelphia and guys getting votes based on what they did in the past instead of what they are doing right now. Juan Uribe is having an excellent year and it is a crying shame that he has been left off the All-Star ballot. He is among the top 3 in the hitting catagories and is having possibly the best year of any National League shortstop.",
    "textAfterTable": "Provided by Baseball-Reference.com: View Original Table Generated 6/17/2010. As I was saying 3 of the top 5 vote getter have no buisiness being anywhere and there is one guy who is deserving that is being left off. Juan Uribe is second in OPS, OPS+ and AVG\u00a0, he is first in home runs, RBIs\u00a0and slugging. These shouldn't be going overlooked. I hope that this mistake is rectified and is added to the roster by the players. If he still isn't added he better be on the last man added vote list and it would be a travisty if he didn't make it.
