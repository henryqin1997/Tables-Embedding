We tried a few samples and we found the XT720 to handle XviD videos of up to WQVGA resolution and no longer than 10-20 minutes. Bigger files (both resolution and time) seem to need more processing power than MILESTONE XT720 can offer. Of course that can\u0092t be entirely true since it plays its own HD videos captured with the camcorder. The only logical explanation is the lack of proper software support.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Here come the detailed results: The frequency response is spot on with the greatest deviation being the 0.16 dB, a value only detectable in lab conditions. The noise level and stereo crosstalk readings are great and so are the distortion levels and the dynamic range. Motorola MILESTONE XT720 performed quite impressively in our audio quality test. It's one of the loudest handset we have seen and it also delivers nicely clean output with audio tracks sounding just the way they were meant to. Audio output loud and clear The FM radio app The Motorola MILESTONE XT720 is equipped with an FM radio with RDS. The interface is simple \u0096 there\u0092s a tuning dial and you can save as many as 20 stations as favorites. You can also listen on the loudspeaker, but the headset is still needed. FM Radio on board There are still some shortcomings of the music player that need addressing though. There are no equalizer presets, nor any alternative skins. Besides gradual typing for searching a specific song, there is an alphabet scroll which appears on the right side of the track list. The \"Now playing screen\" The functionality of the music player hasn't changed",
