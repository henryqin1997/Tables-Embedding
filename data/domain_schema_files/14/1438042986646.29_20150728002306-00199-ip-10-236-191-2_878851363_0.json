Though the edTPA is a relatively new assessment and thus we have a limited sample of candidates, the aggregate data from 2014 indicate that our candidates are achieving high levels on the edTPA. Our candidates are well prepared These positions included districts and schools around Minnesota as well as teaching positions in other states. In 2014, ninety-four percent (94%) of our graduates were hired for teaching positions following graduation. Our candidates are in high demand At Gustavus Adolphus College, we hold high standards for our teacher education program. In order to assess how we are meeting these standards and preparing our candidates, we engage in regular collection and analysis of performance-based data. Among other indicators, these data indicate that our candidates are well prepared and in high demand.
