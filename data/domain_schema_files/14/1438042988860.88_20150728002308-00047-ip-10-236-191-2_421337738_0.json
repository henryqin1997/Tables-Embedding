Responsibilities of the executive committee include: The Executive Committee consists of members from each of the member colleges, three at-large faculty from GDPE faculty membership, two GDPE students, the director, senior ecologist and program coordinator (who serves in a non-voting, ex-officio capacity). The Executive Committee is convened and chaired by the Director. Faculty are elected on an alternating cycle for two-year terms by GDPE faculty to represent the participating colleges of the GDPE. The two student representatives are elected by the GDPE student body for a one-year term. Executive Committee Professor Alan Knapp is the GDPE Senior Ecologist and a professor in the Department of Biology. He advises the director, represents the program both within and outside of the university, and teaches core courses in the GDPE curriculum.",
