The 1947 catalog offered these wrenches in a wide selection of sizes, ranging from the 5/16 BR10 to the huge 2-3/4 BR88., 57541=By 1929 Hinsdale had begun offering open-end wrenches made with chrome vanadium alloy steel. The wrenches were designed with the Hinsdale name and logo forged into the shank, with the model number and \"Chrome-Vanadium-Steel\" on the reverse. Six models were available, with openings ranging from 1/4 to 1 inch., 9764=The 1924 Western Auto \"Ford Owner's Supply Book\" offered a Hinsdale socket set by name, and a group of specialty tools are shown with the Hinsdale logo, a rounded \"H\" with a circle. Another of Hinsdale's products, the G-20 socket set, became widely associated as the tool set for the popular Ford Model T, and likely sold in high volumes for that time. By 1931 the Sears catalog offered several socket sets identifiable as Hinsdale by the illustration of the distinctive Convertible T-L Handle, or in some cases offered under the Hinsdale name., 33181=The pending status refers to patent #1,650,085, filed by J.W. McDonough in 1924 and issued in 1927., 120177=Beckley-Ralston No. 91. The 1924 catalog No. 91 from Beckley-Ralston, a distributor of automotive tools and supplies, shows several tools with the Hinsdale logo, and may have sourced other private-branded tools from Hinsdale., 114575=To estimate the date of manufacture for these tools, we can note that both wrenches have a plain (unplated) finish, and that the Craftsman model has the original (non-underlined) logo registered in 1927. Both of these observations would be consistent with a manufacturing date in the late 1920s to early 1930s range. However, no Craftsman box-end wrenches were found in a 1931 Sears catalog, so the likely manufacturing date can be narrowed to 1932-1934., 41295=The ratchet is notable in its patent date of Aug. 15, 1922, corresponding to patent #1,425,816, the earliest of the patents used by Hinsdale. Based on this early patent, this set is believed to be one of the first Hinsdale sets to use square-drive machined sockets. Earlier sets contained sockets suitable for lighter duty work, with thin-wall hex drive or pressed steel square drive., 70882=Fig. 39 shows a 1/2-drive SR30 15/16 12-point socket, which is listed in the 1947 catalog as part of their standard 1/2-drive socket line. The catalog also notes that Hinsdale had in-house capability for hot-broaching sockets at this time., 87541=Fig. 50 shows a Hinsdale 1723 3/8x7/16 open-end wrench, stamped \"Chrome Vanadium\" with the Hinsdale name and embedded Round-H-Circle logo., 10578=By 1929 (or earlier) Hinsdale was offering socket sets of chrome-nickel alloy steel. An advertisement in Popular Science Monthly from May of 1929 ( page 141 at the left) offers a \"36 Piece Chrome Nickel Master Socket Wrench Set\" for just $7.95 plus shipping. The set included a ratchet, T-L handle, speeders, and a selection of sockets, and the description specifically mentions the use of S.A.E. 3130 alloy steel., 42915=Fig. 17 shows the early ratchet from the set, with \"Made in U.S.A.\" curved around the Hinsdale logo, and the \"Pat. Aug. 15 1922\" patent date., 73438=Another likely catalog reference comes from the 1933 Sears Spring and Summer catalog, which offered a \"Hinsdale 9-Piece Set\" under catalog number 5872, with a description and illustration matching this set after allowing for the missing pieces. In the 1934 catalog a set with the same description and catalog number was offered as \"Craftsman 9-Pc. Wrench Set\", and an example can be seen as the Craftsman Vanadium 5872 \"9-Piece\" Socket Set., 83285=The manufacturing date for this wrench is somewhat uncertain, but probably dates from the early to mid 1930s. The 1931 Sears catalog offered a set of Hinsdale Vanadium open-end wrenches, and this may be an example. This style of wrench was still listed in the 1935 Hinsdale catalog, although the \"Chrome Vanadium\" line of open-end wrenches (see next figures) was also available at that time., 121238=Channon Catalog No. 102. The 1936 catalog No. 102 from the H. Channon Company, a major industrial distributor, lists five pages of Hinsdale tools. Included in the listings are the No. 11M and No. 17M 9/32-drive socket sets, the No. 13J and No. 18J 3/8-drive socket sets, and the No. 13R and No. 29R 1/2-drive socket sets. The descriptions mention the use of S.A.E. 6140 chrome-vanadium steel with a triple chrome plated finish., 35232=The ratchet in this set is marked as model S-15 and has a \"Pat. Pend.\" notation on the handle. After a search of the patent records, the corresponding patent was found to be #1,650,085, issued to John W. McDonough on November 22, 1927, with assignment to Hinsdale Manufacturing. As the patent was filed in 1924, this particular ratchet was likely manufactured between 1924 and 1927., 120573=Western Auto Supply 1924. The 1924 \"Ford Owner's Supply Book\" from Western Auto Supply, a major retailer, illustrates an early Hinsdale socket set and shows specialty tools with the Hinsdale logo., 92037=Box-end wrenches in the HD-series were listed in a 1933 Hinsdale advertising brochure, with six models being offered at exceptionally low prices. The models available were the HD1 (3/8x7/16), HD2 (1/2x9/16), HD3 (5/8x11/16), HD4 (3/4x25/32), HD5 (13/16x7/8), and HD6 (15/16x1). The brochure description noted that the wrenches were made of chrome vanadium steel and finished in chrome plating., 92875=By 1935 Hinsdale was offering straight box wrenches in six models from X1 (3/8x7/16) to X6 (15/16x1), plus three models of short offset box wrenches from X10 (3/8x7/16) to X30 (5/8x11/16). The X1-X6 series have been found marked for the Sears Craftsman line, and it's possible that the short wrenches were also supplied to Craftsman., 93218=The 1935 catalog notes that the box wrenches were hot forged from SAE 6140 chrome vanadium steel, then electrically heat-treated. The standard finish was chrome plating with satin handles and polished heads., 13050=During the 1930s the company developed a line of heavy-duty tools for use in oilfield or other industrial applications, a line which included socket tools of 1-1/4 inch drive size. A catalog from around 1947 shows them with a modest line of service and maintenance tools, including socket sets, open and box-end wrenches, combination wrenches, and other tools. The catalog also includes pictures of their production facilities and of the Hinsdale booth at a trade show., 106875=The X20 wrench was offered in a 1935 catalog at a list price of just $0.75, or $2.25 for the set of three short offset box wrenches., 11431=By 1930 Hinsdale had begun using the \"Bob Cat\" brand for alloy steel tools, with a logo composed of a growling cat's head between the two words. This brand has been noted in the Sears Roebuck catalogs, but was not previously known as a Hinsdale product. Several examples of advertisements for Bob Cat tools have been found in Popular Science Monthly, such as the one from April of 1931 (page 132 at the upper right) offering an \"Alloy Chisel Set\" made of \"Bob Cat Special Alloy Steel\". The \"Bob Cat\" branded tools are not very common, suggesting that the brand may have been in use only briefly., 108901=The finish appears to be a cadmium plate, making it likely that these were made during 1943-1945. These wrench models are listed in the 1947 catalog., 19827=In the years before 1920, fixed socket wrenches were among the most important tools for automobile repair. Standard configurations and sizes were available for popular cars (i.e. the Model T), and most service jobs could be performed with a selection of 5 or 10 wrenches. Although the popularity of the fixed socket wrenches declined as interchangeable sockets improved, these tools continued selling well into the 1920s., 103222=The X3 wrench was offered in a 1935 catalog at an $0.80 list price, or $5.65 for the set of six straight box wrenches., 82442=Fig. 47 shows a Hinsdale \"Vanadium\" 1729 5/8x3/4 open-end wrench with depressed panels, marked with \"Hinsdale\" and the embedded Round-H-Circle logo plus \"Vanadium\" forged into the front panel, with \"Forged in U.S.A.\" forged into the reverse panel. The faces are stamped with the fractional sizes on the front, with the model number on the reverse., 46452=This ratchet has the same design as the model S-15 ratchet shown with the No. 12B-R Socket Set, and also happens to be marked with a \"Pat. Pend.\" notation. The ratchets are covered by patent #1,650,085, which places the likely date of manufacture in the range 1924-1927., 79574=The handle/extension is marked with the Hinsdale logo and \"Chrome Vanadium\", but without a model number; however, the 1935 catalog identifies this tool as a model HXM5. The sliding Tee handle is marked \"Chrome Vanadium\" with the Fat-H-Circle logo, and is catalog model H7M., 78352=Fig. 44 shows an example, a 9/32 drive flex-head handle. No model number is marked, but the 1947 catalog lists this tool as an H5M \"Hinged Tee Handle\"., 18225=The \"Hinsdale, Illinois\" marking on this wrench indicates early production, as the company remained in its Hinsdale location only from 1919 through 1921., 81271=By 1947 the Hinsdale catalog still offered a model 11M socket set, but with a different sized box, 6.1 inches vs. the present 7.9 inches. Thus the likely manufacturing date for this set would range from 1935 to the early 1940s., 66408=The Hinsdale F-5 ratchet wrench is illustrated on page 217 of the 1924 Beckley-Ralston catalog, where it is noted for adjusting Ford (Model T) brake and reverse bands. Interestingly, the illustration includes the patent date \"PATD 8-15-22\", a reference to patent #1,425,816, issued to V. Van Horn on that date. (This patent date is incorrectly listed as 8-11-22 in AWM2e.) The present tool uses a similar but later patent assigned to Hinsdale Manufacturing., 20258=Hinsdale is known to have produced a number of models of fixed socket wrenches, based on the listings in the 1924 Western Auto Supply catalog. However, these tools are now fairly uncommon, and currently we have only a single model to display., 12720=In spite of whatever difficulties occurred during the depression years, Hinsdale was able to resume operations sometime later. By 1933 the company was advertising box-end wrenches and socket sets made of chrome vanadium steel, including wrenches in the HD-series identified as being sold under the Sears Craftsman brand., 94744=The model HD2 wrench was offered in early 1933 at a dealer price of just $0.21, for a retail price of $0.40, prices comparable to the aggressive pricing being offered by Western Auto and Plomb Tool around that time., 117374=Hinsdale is mentioned briefly in American Wrench Makers 1830-1930, 2nd Edition by Kenneth Cope (Astragal Press, 2002) (AWM2e in the text), which reprints an early advertisement stating the 1919 founding date. (Note though that one of the patent dates mentioned there is incorrect.), 72886=Currently we don't have an exact reference for this set in the Hinsdale catalogs, but a Hinsdale advertising brochure from 1933 shows a similar but smaller No. 10AC set. The 10AC set is described as an \"Aviation Type Socket Wrench Set\" and consists of six double-hex sockets with an Ell handle. (The drive size is not specified, but would be 3/8-drive based on the proportions of the tools.) The illustration shows the sockets with tapered walls and a knurled band around the base, closely resembling the sockets in the present set., 115039=After the above estimates were made, a Hinsdale advertising brochure was acquired which confirmed that the HD-series wrenches were available in early 1933., 12158=An interesting snippet of Hinsdale history comes from the web site of Berland's Tools, a company with connections to the founders of Sherman-Klove (S-K) tools. According to the historical information posted there, Sherman-Klove was the manufacturer of the socket sets sold by Hinsdale, and in the early 1930s Hinsdale ceased operations. This left Sherman-Klove with a large inventory of unsold goods, and handling the leftover inventory provided the impetus to form S-K Hand Tools in 1932. S-K of course went on to find considerable success on its own., 8590=Hinsdale Manufacturing's first factory was located at 47th and County Line Road in Hinsdale, but the company remained in Hinsdale only briefly. By 1921 the company had moved into a factory at 1857 Fulton Street in Chicago, and apparently also established a business or sales office at 215-217 North Desplaines Avenue, a few blocks away from the Fulton Street address. The 1930 Donnelley's Industrial Directory listed Hinsdale Manufacturing at 217 North Desplaines, and an advertising brochure from 1933 lists the address at 215 North Desplaines. The company remained at the 1857 Fulton Street location for its subsequent years., 84418=Fig. 48 shows a Hinsdale \"Vanadium\" 1031 25/32x7/8 open-end wrench with depressed panels, marked with \"Hinsdale\" and the embedded Round-H-Circle logo plus \"Vanadium\" forged into the front panel, with \"Forged in U.S.A.\" forged into the reverse panel. The faces are stamped with the fractional sizes on the front, with the model number on the reverse., 122158=An advertisement in the May 1929 issue of Popular Science Monthly shows a 36 Piece Chrome Nickel Master Socket Wrench Set on page 141 at the left. The set included a ratchet, T-L handle, speeders, and a selection of sockets, and the description specifically mentions the use of S.A.E. 3130 alloy steel. The price was just $7.95 plus shipping., 112325=In addition to producing tools for the Craftsman line, Hinsdale also supplied tools to Sears to be sold under the Hinsdale name. A 1931 Sears Spring and Summer catalog listed several Hinsdale tools by name; for example, a 46-piece alloy steel socket set in a hip-roof box was offered for $5.85. Another smaller set included 17 cadmium-plated sockets and a T-L handle in a sliding box, all for just 98 cents. Also available were socket sets of the Bobcat (or Bob-Cat) brand, which has been identified recently as a Hinsdale brand for alloy-steel tools. In 1931 the Craftsman brand had not yet been extended to socket sets, and several other brands of socket sets were offered, including Merit and Durobilt., 116388=As with the 11M set, the box for these tools has a raised shelf with holes sized to hold the sockets and tabs to restrain the drive tools. The overall length of the box is 6.2 inches, shorter than the 11M example above, but nearly the same as the 11M set listed in the 1947 Hinsdale catalog. (This set substitutes a plain extension for the handle extension of the 11M set, and therefore can fit in a smaller box.), 16214=Hinsdale used the \"Bob Cat\" brand for some alloy steel tools, probably beginning in 1930 or shortly before., 113040=The 1931 Sears catalog did offer Craftsman \"Vanadium\" open-end wrenches and several models of Craftsman pliers, along with competing models from Fulton, Merit, and Pexto. A five piece set of Hinsdale Vanadium open-end wrenches was offered for somewhat less than the Craftsman Vanadium wrench set., 122672=An ad in the April 1931 issue of Popular Science Monthly offers an Alloy Chisel Set made of \"Bob Cat Special Alloy Steel\". This is one of several examples of Hinsdale advertisements that mention Bob Cat tools, with a logo composed of a growling cat's head between the words \"Bob\" and \"Cat\". The Bob Cat brand had been noted in some Sears Roebuck catalogs, but had not been previously recognized as a Hinsdale product., 65892=The pending status refers to patent #1,650,085, filed by J.W. McDonough in 1924 and issued in 1927. This ratchet wrench has the same design as the model S-15 ratchet in the No. 12B-R Socket Set and the Hinsdale H-1 Ratchet, both shown in previous figures., 57870=An example of these early alloy steel wrenches can be seen in a June 1929 advertisement in Popular Science Monthly, which shows a Hinsdale Chrome Vanadium Wrench Set in the right-hand column. The illustration shows a set of five wrenches in a holder, although later advertisements show six wrenches in the set. The text notes the use of S.A.E. 6130 chrome-vanadium steel and states that the wrenches are \"Guaranteed Forever Against Breakage\". The wrench set could be ordered by mail for just $2.00 plus shipping. (This same advertisement is also reprinted in AWM2e on page 167.), 80971=The 1935 Hinsdale catalog offered an 11M socket set with the description and illustration matching this set, and the text notes the use of chrome vanadium steel and a chrome plated finish. (Interestingly though, the description didn't mention the 9/32 drive size.) The price was $4.95 list., 67218=The tool is a single-ended flex-socket wrench intended for connecting rod bolts, and is shown on page 219 of the 1924 Beckley-Ralston catalog. No model number is given, but the illustration shows a \"Pat. Pend.\" notation with the Hinsdale Fat-H-Circle logo. The corresponding patent has been identified as #1,597,939, issued to F. Wermes in 1926. This tool appears to be significant as the possibly the earliest example of a flex-socket wrench, a form that was later offered by a number of companies including Snap-On, Herbrand, Cornwell, and others., 120903=Sears Roebuck 1929. A 1929 Sears Roebuck catalog shows several socket sets recognizable as Hinsdale, and the 1931 Sears catalog shows several Hinsdale products by name., 47780=This tool has a \"Pat. Apld. For\" notation as was the case with the H-1 ratchet. After a lengthy search of the patent records, the patent was found to be #1,597,747, filed by F. Wermes in 1923 and issued on August 31, 1926. The patent dates would suggest an estimated production date in the range 1923-1926; however, all known examples of this tool have been found with the patent applied marking, rather than a patent date or number., 69516=Fig. 38 shows a Hinsdale 1/2-drive reversible ratchet with model number H-12-R. This example matches the dimensions for the ratchet illustrated in their 1947 catalog, which notes that the reversible ratchet is a new model and so likely dates from that time. (The Hinsdale catalog is unusual in that it gives engineering drawings of the tools with dimensions.) The overall length is 10.5 inches., 93435=In later years Hinsdale updated the model numbers for the HD series to include both sizes encoded in 32nds, a fairly standard practice in the tool industry. By 1947 the box wrenches were available in a very wide range of sizes, ranging from the 5/16x3/8 model HD10-12 up to the huge 2-9/16x2-3/4 model HD82-88., 8253=The Hinsdale Manufacturing Company was founded in 1919 by Fred W. Miller, and operated initially in Hinsdale, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. The founding date can confirmed by at least two sources: a reprinted early advertisement in AWM2e, and a 1947 Hinsdale catalog that provides a brief company history.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Trademarks Hinsdale Manufacturing does not appear at all in a search of the USPTO trademark records, despite their references to trademark registration in company literature and even in tool forgings! Hinsdale used the \"Bob Cat\" brand for some alloy steel tools, probably beginning in 1930 or shortly before. Tool Identification Hinsdale tools are generally easy to identify, as they were typically marked with a distinctive logo resembling a rounded \"H\" in a circle. We will refer to this as the Round-H-Circle logo in the text. The Hinsdale rounded \"H\" logo should not be confused with the H-Circle logo used by New Britain Machine for Craftsman-branded tools. The latter H-Circle uses an \"H\" with straight sides. Hinsdale tools marked with the Bob Cat brand were generally not marked with the company name or the Round-H-Circle logo. The Bob Cat marking sometimes appeared as a single word, and sometimes as two words with a cat's head in between. Early Tools Early 5/8x11/16 Open-End Wrench with Stamped Construction Fig. 1.
