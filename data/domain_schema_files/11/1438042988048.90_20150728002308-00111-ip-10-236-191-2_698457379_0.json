Ever since, piano makers have been searching for the perfect hammer-head for a consummate sound. At Schimmel, the characteristics of the hammer-head felts which have an influence on the composition of the tone are examined meticulously. The density and weight of the felt, its tension and simultaneous flexibility, the type of wool utilised and how this wool is processed, the correct way of cutting the felt and the way in which it is moulded: these aspects are all vital to ensure that our hammerheads transfer the energy of the player\u2019s touch to the resonating strings in an optimum manner. The felt manufacture is undertaken according to a traditional process which is more time-consuming than modern industrial felt manufacture, but is the sole method to ensure delivery of premium-quality felt for our instruments., 13261=L (inch) | L x H x W (cm): 9' 2\" | 280 x 102 x 154 Weight (lbs | kg): 1210 | 550, 24044=Pythagoras of Samos is said to have asserted that \u2018Everything is related to numbers\u2019. In ancient times, he experimented on a one-stringed instrument to discover the ratio between notes and numbers. This interrelationship is still relevant today for the constructors at Schimmel: for example, when they calculate and develop the cast-iron plates for specific instruments according to stability and acoustic criteria. Nowadays, they employ high-tech software for this purpose which is also utilised in the aircraft construction industry. The almost 1000 computer-controlled precision bore holes in the sounding body alone guarantee a fitting accuracy to a micronexact degree in the acoustic element of the piano. This is precision work which makes a major contribution to the consummate sound of our upright and grand pianos., 18509=H (inch) | H x W x D (cm): 8' 4\" | 256 x 102 x 154 Weight (lbs | kg): 1100 | 500}",
