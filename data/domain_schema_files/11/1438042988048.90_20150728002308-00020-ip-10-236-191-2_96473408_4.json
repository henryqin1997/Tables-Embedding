And Penny in 2010 isn\u2019t likely to match Pineiro\u2019s 2009, but neither is Pineiro for that matter. Sorry, I\u2019m telling you stuff you already know., 5271=I\u2019ve run my defensive projections for 2011 using UZR as the primary input data source. \u00a0For a general feel for the methodology read this post. \u00a0A couple changes from last year, 54525=CAIRO\u2019s projected standings are updated, too. For what it\u2019s worth, the Cubs are the favorite for the wild card. I think people, myself included, have overlooked the Cubs a bit. Aramis Ramirez will be healthy again, Geovany Soto should bounce back, Alfonso Soriano can\u2019t possibly be worse than he was in 2009 (can he?) and their rotation should be very good. Their bullpen looks a bit shaky to me. Still, they are returning much of the same talent that won 97 games just a couple of seasons ago., 67545=As for the Cubs, they\u2019re hanging in there. Soriano and Soto can\u2019t possibly be\u00a0worse, Ramirez will be healthy, Byrd in 2010 ought to\u00a0be\u00a0better than Bradley was in \u201909. On the other hand, Randy Wells should fall back to earth some, and Rich Harden\u2019s spot in the rotation is going to be replaced by Tom Gorzellany or *gasp* Carlos Silva., 45684=So I hope I\u2019ve established that he has the pitches to start, how exactly would he do?\u00a0Sean Smith did a study on pitchers from 1953 up to 2008, and found that when switching from starting to relief and vice-versa, a pitcher\u2019s walk rate would stay static, while their hits went +/- 5%, their homers went +/- 15%, and their strikeouts went +/- 16%. Let\u2019s apply those numbers to McClellan and see what we come up with. First, here\u2019s his 50th percentile CHONE projection as a reliever:}",
