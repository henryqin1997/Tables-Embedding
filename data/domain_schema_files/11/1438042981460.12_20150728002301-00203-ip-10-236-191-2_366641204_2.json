They have a running depth between 3 and 14 feet. With its slight exaggeration of Rapala's unique baitfish-in-distress behavior, the Jointed\u2122 gets the undivided attention of otherwise uninterested gamefish. This articulated, or \"broken back\" lure can be fished like the Original Floater\u00ae, top to bottom. It is the perfect choice after a cold front, when fish are traditionally finicky and in a negative feeding mood.
