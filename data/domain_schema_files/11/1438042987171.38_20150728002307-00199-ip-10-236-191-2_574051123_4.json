Artemia cysts (available in aquaristic shops) were incubated in 1 L of natural filtered seawater for 24 h. Cysts were maintained at 25 \u00baC with continuous light and aeration. Ten to fifteen individuals were placed into 200 \u03bcL of test solution in triplicate. Control was performed with natural filtered seawater. Plates were incubated in the dark for 48 h, with very low agitation. After 24 and 48 h, dead nauplii were counted and by the end of the assay total numbers of individuals were registered. Results were expressed as percentage of mortality and LC50 was calculated using the statistic software 8.0 of StatSoft Inc. 1984\u20132007 version.}",
