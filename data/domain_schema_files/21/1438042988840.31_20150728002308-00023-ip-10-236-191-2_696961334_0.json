He returned to the Lions for 2012 and hit .311/.382/.451. That is not an eye-popping line, but the batting average was one point off the league lead, the OBP was second by a wider margin and his slugging percentage ranked fourth. In the field, Nakajima led the Pacific League in putouts and was second in assists, while committing 18 errors. Despite his solid numbers at the plate and in the field, the MLB establishment does not seem quite sold on Nakajima as an MLB starter. There is some sound reasoning for this: we have yet to see a Japanese shortstop stick in MLB, Nakajima's power projects as pretty low for an MLB third baseman and learning second base at the MLB level is a tall order. The A's will give him a look as a potential regular at shortstop this season after signing him to a two-year deal in December., 20785=6/1/2013, 23801=5/17/2013, 18797=4/30/2014, 26995=Nakajima has been one of the top shortstops in Japan, hitting .302/.369/.475 over his career. He was posted after last season by his team, the Seibu Lions, and the Yankees won his rights with a a bid around $2 million. He hit .302/.360/.448 with 16 home runs and 20 stolen bases last season. Nakajima is a line-drive/gap hitter, who is capable of showing some opposite field power. In the field, he tends to make the plays he gets to, but has somewhat suspect range. Nakajima and the Yankees were unable to reach a contract agreement, so he'll return to Japan for 2012. Still, he'll likely move to MLB in 2013 as he'll be an international free agent after the season., 25896=2013, 25745=2015, 26943=2012, 19766=8/16/2013, 17832=9/4/2014, 11255=Age is determined on July 1st of each season. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jump To:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25bc Advanced Stats, 21757=5/23/2013, 24702=5/15/2013}",
