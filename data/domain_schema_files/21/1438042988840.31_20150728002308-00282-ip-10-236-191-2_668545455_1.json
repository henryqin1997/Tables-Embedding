Rathdowney's goal is to rapidly advance its Project Olza, and build the next generation of zinc-lead-silver mines,\" added Mr. Barry. Mississippi Valley-Type deposits are so-named because several classic deposits of this type occur in the Mississippi region in central United States. MVT deposits are economically very important, accounting for 24% of the global resources for lead and zinc (USGS, 2010; endnote 1). Silver is commonly an important by-product. Large MVT districts, extending over thousands of square kilometres, occur throughout the world. The deposits range in size from a few hundred thousand tonnes to nearly 400 million tonnes, with the median size being 7 million tonnes averaging 6% Zn, 1.9% Pb and 32 g/t Ag (USGS, 2010; endnote 1). Large MVT districts include Southeast Missouri (3,000 sq km), Tri-State (1,800 sq km), Pine Point (1,600 sq km), Upper Silesia (2,800 sq km), Irish Midlands (8,000 sq km), and the Upper Mississippi Valley (7,800 sq km) (Sangster, 1990; endnote 3). Comparison between the Upper Silesian and Pine Point districts is illustrative in some respects. For example, the Pine Point district, located in northern Canada, contains more than 80 deposits. Cominco mined 48 deposits at Pine Pint between 1964 and 1988, producing a total of 64.3 million tonnes of ore grading 7.0% zinc and 3.1% lead (CAM, 2007; endnote 4). Ireland In the Irish Midlands zinc-lead-silver district, Rathdowney commenced exploration drilling in mid-May in the region south of the recent Pallas Green discovery. To establish drill targets, Rathdowney invested $3.5 million on exploration in this region, including the collection of over 20,000 soil samples and the pioneering of heliborne Sky-TEM (conductivity) geophysical technology. This surface exploration generated 45 compelling drill targets. A 15,000 metre diamond drill program is underway to test these new targets, many of which are associated with prospective major NE-SW to E-W trending fault zones within areas of significant hydrothermal alteration and breccia development. To date, 4,600 metres have been drilled in the Mallow and Westmeath-South target areas. Within the Mallow target area, five holes drilled along the northern limb of a major anticline have intersected anomalous concentrations of zinc. This drilling has greatly increased the Company's knowledge of this structural corridor and additional drilling is planned. In addition, a drill rig has been mobilised to the Galway target-area to test a prominent zinc geochemical anomaly straddling a structure which extends on to the historical Tynagh zinc-lead mine. Based on detailed compilation of new and historical drilling information, Rathdowney is refining targets for the Moyvore area, where the southwest and northeast extensions of a seven kilometre long by one to two kilometre wide structural zone will be tested.

John Barry President & CEO Sample preparation and analysis for Project Olza is done at ISO 17025:20 05 accredited Omac Laboratories Ltd. (Stewart Group/ALS Laboratory Group) in Loughrea, Ireland. All samples are assayed for zinc, lead and silver by HNO3, KClO4 and HBr and the final solution in dilute Aqua Regia is determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma--Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) finish. These three elements and 42 additional elements are also determined for all samples by 4 acid digestion, followed by ICP-OES finish. As part of a comprehensive QA/QC program, one standard and one replicate are inserted into the sample stream in each group of 20 samples, as well as one or more blanks in each analytical batch.

Rathdowney is focused on building a major resource base in a region where infrastructure, such as ZGHB's concentrator-smelter complex, will have excess capacity as its Pomorzany mine is exhausted. To achieve this, Rathdowney has embarked on a fully-funded $21 million resource delineation program consisting of a total of 95,000 metres of diamond drilling planned to the end of 2012. The number of drill rigs will increase as the focus shifts over the coming weeks to Zawiercie Zone III where, historically, some of the highest grades were reported.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "<< Drag to view the table >> September 22, 2011, Vancouver, BC -- Rathdowney Resources Ltd. (\"Rathdowney\" or the Company\") (TSXV: RTH) announces assay results for the first 20 core holes (OLZ-001 thru OLZ-020), representing 2,348 metres of the ongoing 30,000-metre Phase I diamond drilling program at the Company's Project Olza, located 90 kilometres northwest of Krakow, Poland. These initial holes have cut impressive sections of high-grade zinc-lead-silver mineralisation which confirms the continuity of Zawiercie Zone I. Zawiercie I is the first of several zinc-lead-silver zones and deposits to be drill-tested and delineated by Rathdowney. The Project Olza mineral concessions cover the unexploited and underexplored extension of a major belt of Mississippi Valley-Type (\"MVT\") deposits within the Upper Silesia zinc-lead-silver district of southern Poland. Rathdowney's drilling program is planned to establish the grade and extent of deposits indicated by extensive previous work, including 180,000 metres of drilling conducted by the Polish State Survey. The program involves the twinning of a number of historical drill-holes to confirm the internal continuity of the mineralization as well as drilling of step-out holes in the range of 50-metre intervals to delineate deposit resources. The current drill program is expected to advance the project towards completion of an initial NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate in 2012. Significant assay results from holes OLZ-001 thru OLZ-020 are listed below. A plan map and drill-hole sections are available at www.rathdowneyresources.com. Results",
    "textAfterTable": "All holes were drilled vertically through the sub-horizontal mineralised horizon, so intersections represent approximate true widths. No significant intersections in holes OLZ-008 or 015; lower grade/narrower intersections were encountered in holes OLZ -004, 005, 007, 010. No core was recovered from 104.05 to 104.40 m in hole OLZ-001 or from 89.60 to 89.85 m in hole OLZ-009. \"We are very pleased with the initial results from our extensive drill program. Fourteen of our initial vertical drill holes intersected important concentrations of zinc, lead and silver,\" said John Barry, President and CEO of Rathdowney. \"A fence of holes drilled at 50-metre spacings (OLZ-019, OLZ-011 and OLZ-014) clearly confirms continuity of a high-grade zone. Intersections of 15% zinc and 5% lead over four metres in drill hole OLZ-011 and more than 10% zinc in holes OLZ-014 and OLZ-019 are particularly encouraging. There is also excellent continuity along the \"spine\" of the northern part of Zone I mineralisation, as illustrated by the results from the string of drill holes numbered OLZ-016, OLZ-001, OLZ-017, OLZ-013, OLZ-006 and OLZ-003. To the northeast a step-out from OLZ-017 cut 2.6 metres averaging 2.0% zinc in OLZ-005 but a further step-out along the same trend cut 2.4 metres averaging 0.5% zinc and 4.2% lead in OLZ-004 indicating that mineralisation intensity increases again. These results are typical of a robust MVT mineralising system and indicate excellent potential to establish substantial resources as drilling continues.\" \"The",
