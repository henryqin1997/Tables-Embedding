    "textBeforeTable": "The RAM Table NOR flash memory, invented by Dr. Fujio Masuoka, has longer read and write times than his other flash memory invention, NAND flash memory but does have full address and data buses allowing for random access, and is the only current flash memory to do so. Intel has been a great supporter of this technology. NOR flash memory Rambus Dynamic RAM (RDRAM) is a video RAM designed by Rambus that includes a proprietary bus that speeds up the data flow between video RAM and the frame buffer. It is optimized for video streaming and high bandwidth. Rambus has had some use as desktop ram especially in Intel Pentium 4 processors but market penetration was limited due to heat power consumption and cost. Rambus Dynamic RAM Multibank Dynamic RAM (MDRAM) is a high-performance RAM, developed by MoSys, that divides memory into multiple 32 KB parts or \"banks\" that can be accessed individually. Traditional video RAM is monolithic; the entire frame buffer is accessed at one time. Having individual memory banks allows accesses to be interleaved concurrently, increasing overall performance. It's also cheaper since, unlike other forms of video RAM, cards can be manufactured with just the right amount of RAM for a given resolution capability instead of requiring it to be in multiples of megabytes. Multibank Dynamic RAM Window RAM (WRAM), unrelated to Microsoft Windows, is very high-performance video RAM that is dual-ported and has about 25% more",
