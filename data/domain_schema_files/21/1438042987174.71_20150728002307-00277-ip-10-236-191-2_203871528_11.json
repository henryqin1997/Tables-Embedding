Email\u00a0sagehen.programs@gmail.com\u00a0to sign up., 36556=River restoration has become big business in the US, with well over $17b spent on over 40 thousand projects since 1990. Despite strong public support and the magnitude of the investment, the field has not advanced as quickly as one might expect, because learning through post-project evaluation is rare, and insights from current research are often not effectively incorporated in planning and design. River restoration can be more effective when it is designed with an understanding of processes and the larger context, when it benefits from systematic learning from previous built projects, and when it is based on predictive connections between objectives and actions., 33229=The goal of this citizen science project is to confirm the Field Station's plant and animal lists with actual, geo-referenced observations for use by the greater scientific community. So far, we have only documented 399 of 1366 taxa assumed to exist in the Basin. Using smart phones and cameras, volunteers accompanied by a\u00a0California Naturalist\u00a0will work together to find and identify as many different species as possible within Sagehen Creek Basin \u2013 everything from ants to Lodgepole Pines. Our observations will be recorded using iNaturalist.org., 34752=Sagehen BioBlitz:\u00a0July 11-July 12. You bring your smart phone and tons of enthusiasm.
