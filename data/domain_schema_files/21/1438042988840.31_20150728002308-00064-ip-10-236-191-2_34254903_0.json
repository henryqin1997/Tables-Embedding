Pizac, The Associated Press), 90741=Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 LeBron James, top, shoots over New York Knicks\u2019 Jose Calderon during the first half of an NBA basketball game, Sunday, Feb. 22, 2015, in New York. (Seth Wenig, The Associated Press), 41306=When: Russell Westbrook\u2019s performance in the evaluation period of Feb. 21-27 was off the charts. Three consecutive triple-doubles earned him The Denver Post\u2019s NBA player of the week award., 91113=With about 10:30 remaining in the first quarter of the Cavaliers\u2019 win against the Knicks in New York on Sunday, James scored off a layup that moved him ahead of former Nugget Allen Iverson on the league\u2019s all-time scoring list., 129879=But more telling, perhaps, were his comments about the 2003 sexual assault case in Colorado, an incident that will always be a part of his legacy, even though the charges were dropped. Bryant had sex with a woman in Edwards, near where he was to undergo knee surgery by Dr. Richard Steadman. The woman accused Bryant of raping her in his hotel room at The Lodge & Spa at Cordillera, but the case was dropped after she refused to testify. A civil suit was later settled and Bryant publicly apologized, but admitted no guilt., 47460=In 1947, the New York Knicks drafted 23-year-old Japanese-American guard Wat Misaka from the University of Utah in the Basketball Association of America draft. The BAA would merge with the National Basketball League in 1949 to form the NBA., 116345=Arrival Acquired from Washington as part of a three-team trade with the Clippers on March 15, 2012., 59132=Eric Bledsoe of the Phoenix Suns and Jusuf Nurkic of the Denver Nuggets vie for a tip off at Pepsi Center on Feb. 25, 2015 in Denver.

In the hallway leading to the dressing room, he was shown plaques for every Knicks team, and there on the 1947-48 plaque was his name., 48357=In 2009, Misaka returned to the Garden for the first time since he was cut. In an interview with The New York Times that day, he admired a plaque that had his name on it., 41526=What\u2019s up: In a packed week of five games in seven nights, Westbrook showed no signs of wear, averaging a triple-double of 30.6 points, 11.8 assists and 10.6 rebounds. An incredible week completed an amazing February for the former UCLA star, who averaged 31.2 points, 10.3 assists and 9.1 rebounds in 12 games.

In 2013, he raved about Iverson in multiple interviews with ESPN, telling Tom Haberstroh that Iverson is \u201cPound-for-pound, probably the greatest player who ever played., 77296=Rose has helped the Bulls to the No. 3 spot in the East this season, averaging 18.4 points on 40.7 percent shooting from the field with 5.0 assists in 46 games \u2014 his best numbers since the lockout-shortened 2011-12 season., 53723=Nuggets guard Ty Lawson, during the team\u2019s home loss to Charlotte on Jan. 31.

In 1944, he helped the Utes win the NCAA championship in the arena. But it was three years later in the 1947 NIT championship game where Misaka\u2019s play left a resonating impact with New York fans., 27819=\u2014 Scott Agness (@ScottAgness) March 3, 2015, 117330=Departure Traded to Philadelphia, along with a future first-round pick, to Philadelphia on Feb. 19, 2015.
