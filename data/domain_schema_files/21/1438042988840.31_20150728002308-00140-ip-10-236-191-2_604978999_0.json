    "textAfterTable": "Overview Imaging the shoulder is optimal with a dedicated shoulder coil and careful patient positioning in external rotation with the shoulder as close as reasonably possible to the center of the magnet. Axial proton density, coronal oblique T2 fat sat and proton density, and sagittal oblique T2 provide an assessment of the rotator cuff, biceps, deltoid, acromio-clavicular joint, the gleno-humeral joint and surrounding large structures. If a labral injure is suspected, the optional fat sat gradient echo sequence (series 6) may be helpful or it may be necessary to bring the patient back for an MR shoulder arthrogram with intra-articular injection of dilute gadolinium. Indications see ICD9 codes below Scheduling First ask: 1. Have you recently injured the shoulder? Date of injury? 2. Did you have X-rays? Please bring your shoulder X-rays if not at New York Hospital. 3. Did you ever dislocate the shoulder? 4. Ever have surgery on the shoulder? Date of surgery? 5. Ever have cancer? Type? Date diagnosed? 6. Is there a shoulder mass? If patient has history of cancer or if there is",
