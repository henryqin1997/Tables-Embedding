    "textAfterTable": "For what seemed the first time all season, the Mercedes were actually forced to use their soft tires in Q1, lest they be bumped from quals altogether.\u00a0 There's a huge performance gap between the soft and hards this time, two seconds or so... it's usually half that.\u00a0 Other than that, though, nothing particularly exciting went on.\u00a0 Oh sure, Red Bull seems to have made good use of the past three weeks, looking awfully racy as a result, but with Merc domination it all seems somewhat futile. Probably the highlight of the session was Fernando Alonso's car failing towards the start of Q2.\u00a0 Feeling like he had a chance to make it to Q3, it took his lame car as far as it could go... just short of the pit-in.\u00a0 When it stopped?\u00a0 He hopped out and pushed.\u00a0 Soon, he had an entourage. Yes, that's Alonso waving to the fans while steering his car with one hand while at a fast jog in a firesuit on a 95 degree day with high humidity.\u00a0 Yes, that's also a cheeky trackworker waving to the crowd, too.\u00a0 It almost pains me to point out that the second his car came to a halt on-track it was ineligible to continue the session, but that's just me. So.\u00a0 Race tomorrow morning.\u00a0 F1U! sometime after.\u00a0 Then the summer break, one month until the next race.\u00a0 See ya",
