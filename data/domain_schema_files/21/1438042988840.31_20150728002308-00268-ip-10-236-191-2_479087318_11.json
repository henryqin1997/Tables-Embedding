The water was removed under reduced pressure, and azeotroped with toluene (2\ufffd2 L) to leave the product (95) as an amber liquid, which was used without further purification., 53566=Baclofen is useful in controlling gastro-esophageal reflux disease (van Herwaarden et al., Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002, 16, 1655\u20131662; Ciccaglione et al., Gut 2003, 52, 464\u2013470; Andrews et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,117,908; Fara et al., International Publication No. WO02/096404); in promoting alcohol abstinence in alcoholics (Gessa et al., International Publication No. WO01/26638); in promoting smoking cessation (Gessa et al., International Publication No. WO01/08675); in reducing addiction liability of narcotic agents (Robson et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,126,684); in the treatment of emesis (Bountra et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,719,185) and as an anti-tussive for the treatment of cough (Kreutner et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,006,560)., 60031=Sustained released oral dosage formulations are a conventional solution to the problem of rapid systemic drug clearance, as is well known in the art (see, e.g., \u201cRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences,\u201d Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science, 19th Edition, 1995). Osmotic delivery systems are also recognized methods for sustained drug delivery (See, e.g., Verma et al., Drug Dev. Ind. Pharm. 2000, 26, 695\u2013708). Successful application of these technologies depends on the drug of interest having an effective level of absorption from the large intestine (also referred to herein as the colon), where the dosage form spends a majority of its time during its passage down the gastrointestinal tract. Baclofen is poorly absorbed following administration into the colon in animal models (Merino et al., Biopharm. Drug. Disp. 1989, 10, 279\u2013297), presumably, since the transporter proteins mediating baclofen absorption in the upper region of the small intestine are not expressed in the large intestine. Development of an oral controlled release formulation for baclofen should considerably improve the convenience, efficacy and side effect profile of baclofen therapy. However, the rapid passage of conventional dosage forms through the proximal absorptive region of the small intestine has thus far prevented the successful application of sustained release technologies to this drug. A number of exploratory delivery technologies that rely on either mucoadhesion or gastric retention have been suggested to achieve sustained delivery of baclofen (Sinnreich, U.S. Pat. No. 4,996,058; Khanna, U.S. Pat. No. 5,091,184; Fara et al., supra; Dudhara et al., International Publication No. WO03/011255) though to date none of these appear to be able to achieve sustain blood levels of baclofen in human subjects., 179051=Another method for synthesis of compounds of Formula (I) proceeds via carbonylation of baclofen analog derivative (XI) to an intermediate carbamic acid species, which is captured by an in situ alkylation reaction in an adaptation of methods disclosed in the art (Butcher, Synlett 1994, 825\u20136; Ferres et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,036,829). Carbon dioxide gas is bubbled into a solution containing (XI) and a base (e.g., Cs2CO3, Ag2CO3 or AgO) in a solvent such as DMF or NMP. The activated halide is added, optionally, in the presence of iodide ion as a catalyst, and the carbonylation continued until the reaction is completed. This method is illustrated in Scheme 7 for the preparation of compounds of Formula (I) from halide (XVII)., 57476=The other isomer, S-baclofen, actually antagonizes the action of R-baclofen at GABAB receptors and its antinociceptive activity in the rat spinal cord (Terrence et al., Pharmacology 1983, 27, 85\u201394; Sawynok et al. Pharmacology 1985, 31, 248\u2013259). Orally administered R-baclofen is reported to be about 5-fold more potent than orally administered racemic baclofen, with an R-baclofen regimen of 2 mg t.i.d being equivalent to racemic baclofen at 10 mg t.i.d. (Fromm et al., Neurology 1987, 37, 1725\u20131728). Moreover, the side effect profile, following administration of R-baclofen, has been shown to be significantly reduced, relative to equally efficacious dose of racemic baclofen., 186362=The UHP-complex (4) and a carboxylic acid anhydride (XIX) or a sulfonic acid anhydride (XXI) are reacted in dichloromethane or other suitable solvent at temperatures ranging from about \u221225\ufffd C. to about 100\ufffd C. to generate the anhydrous peroxyacids. The peroxyacids may be generated first and subsequently reacted with the ketocarbamate (XVIII). In some embodiments, a carboxylic acid anhydride is added to a stirred suspension or solution containing the UHP-complex and (XVIII) to generate the peroxycarboxylic acid, which reacts in situ with (XVIII) to give compound (I). In other embodiments, the molar ratio of UHP-complex and the acid anhydride is about 6:1. In still other embodiments, the molar ratio of UHP-complex and acid anhydride (XIX) is between about 5:1 and about 1:1. In yet other embodiments, the molar ratio of UHP-complex and acid anhydride (XIX) is between about 2:1 and about 1:1., 173765=In some embodiments, the compounds of Formulae (II) and (III) and the organic base are contacted with a solvent. In other embodiments, the ratio of the compound of Formula (II) to the compound of Formula (III) is between about 1:1 and 1:20. In still other embodiments, the ratio of the compound of Formula (II) to the compound of Formula (III) is between about 1:15 and 1:20. In still other embodiments, the ratio of the compound of Formula (II) to the compound of Formula (III) is about 1:10. In still other embodiments, the ratio of the compound of Formula (II) to the compound of Formula (III) is between about 1:1 and 1:5. In still other embodiments, the ratio of the compound of Formula (II) to the compound of Formula (III) is about 1:1. In some embodiments, the solvent is dichloromethane, dichloroethane, chloroform, toluene, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidinone, dimethyl sulfoxide, pyridine, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, acetone, 2-butanone, methyl tert-butyl ether, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, tert-butanol, water, hexamethylphosphoramide or combinations thereof. In other embodiments, the organic base is triethylamine, tributylamine, diisopropylethylamine, dimethylisopropylamine, N-methylmorpholine, N-methylpyrrolidine, N-methylpiperidine, pyridine, 2-methylpyridine, 2,6-dimethylpyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]undec-7-ene or combinations thereof., 183713=In some embodiments, the anhydrous oxidant is an anhydrous peroxyacid generated in situ by reaction of the urea-hydrogen peroxide complex (4) (\u201cUHP\u201d) with a carboxylic acid anhydride. In other embodiments, the anhydrous oxidant is an anhydrous peroxysulfonic acid generated in situ by reaction of the urea-hydrogen peroxide complex (4) with a sulfonic acid anhydride. The UHP complex serves as a source of anhydrous hydrogen peroxide and has been used in a variety of oxidative transformations in anhydrous organic solvents (Cooper et al., Synlett. 1990, 533\u2013535; Balicki et al., Synth. Commun. 1993, 23, 3149; Astudillo et al., Heterocycles 1993, 36, 1075\u20131080; Varma et al., Organic Lett. 1999,1, 189\u2013191). However, other suitable sources of anhydrous hydrogen peroxide may also be used in the reaction instead of the UHP-complex (e.g., the 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-hydrogen peroxide complex)., 332617=To a 3-necked 5 L round bottom flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a teflon coated thermocouple was added (\u2212)-2,3-dibenzoyl-L-tartaric acid (1000 g, 2.79 mol) followed by acetic anhydride (2 L). The suspension was stirred and heated to 85\ufffd C. for 2 h during which time the starting material gradually dissolved. A short time thereafter, the product began to crystallize in the reaction mixture and the suspension was then cooled to 25\ufffd C. The product was collected by filtration, washed with 10% acetone in hexane (2\ufffd1 L), and dried in a vacuum oven at 50\ufffd C. overnight to afford the title compound (102) as a white solid. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): \u03b4 6.0 (s, 2H), 7.45 (app. t, 4H), 7.65 (app. t, 2H), 8.05 (d, 4H)., 172814=In some embodiments, the compounds of Formulae (II) and (III) and the metal salt are contacted with a solvent. In other embodiments, the ratio of the compound of Formula (II) to the compound of Formula (III) is between about 1:1 and 1:20. In still other embodiments, the ratio of the compound of Formula (II) to the compound of Formula (III) is between about 1:1 and 1:5. In still other embodiments, the ratio of the compound of Formula (II) to the compound of Formula (III) is about 1:1. In some embodiments, the solvent is dichloromethane, dichloroethane, chloroform, toluene, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidinone, dimethyl sulfoxide, pyridine, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, acetone, 2-butanone, methyl tert-butyl ether, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, tert-butanol, water, hexamethylphosphoramide or combinations thereof. In other embodiments, the metal is Ag, Hg, Na, K, Li, Cs, Ca, Mg or Zn., 336208=To a 3 L three necked round bottom flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, temperature probe, and nitrogen inlet was added (101) (75 g, 139 mmol), R-baclofen (31.2 g, 146 mmol), THF (1000 mL), and water (100 mL). The suspension was stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere at 18\u201320\ufffd C. for 4 h. The reaction became homogenous in 30 min. The THF was removed in vacuo and the reaction mixture was diluted with methyl tert-butyl ether (250 mL) and washed with 1N HCl (1\ufffd500 mL) and water (2\ufffd200 mL). The organic phase was separated and concentrated in vacuo to leave a white solid. The solid was purified by flash chromatography (800 g silica gel; eluting with 20% acetone in hexane) to afford the product (50 g, 125 mmol, 90% yield) as a white solid. Crystallization from either an acetone/hexane mixture or ethyl acetate/heptane mixture afforded the title compound (104) (50 g, 125 mmol, 90% yield) as a white solid. The diastereomeric purity of the product was determined to be >99% d.e. by HPLC using a chiral column. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): \u03b4 0.89 (m, 6H), 1.15 (m, 6H), 1.94 (m, 1H), 2.52 (m, 1H), 2.58 (dd, 1H), 2.78 (dd, 1H), 3.28 (m, 2H), 3.49 (m, 1H), 4.68 (t, 1H), 6.48 (d, 1H), 7.10 (d, 2H), 7.24 (d, 2H). MS (ESI) m/z 398.14 (M\u2212H)\u2212., 172278=Those of skill in the art will appreciate that the following embodiments, infra, refer to compounds of Formulae (I), (II) and (III). In some embodiments, the ratio of the compound of Formula (II) to the compound of Formula (III) is between about 1:1 and 1:20. In other embodiments, the ratio of the compound of Formula (II) to the compound of Formula (III) is between about 1:1 and 1:5. In still other embodiments, the ratio of the compound of Formula (II) to the compound of Formula (III) is about 1:1., 58222=Baclofen, a zwitterionic amino acid, lacks the requisite physicochemical characteristics for effective passive permeability across cellular membranes. Passage of the drug across the gastrointestinal tract and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are mediated primarily by active transport processes, rather than by passive diffusion. Accordingly, baclofen is a substrate for active transport mechanisms shared by neutral \u03b1-amino acids like leucine, and \u03b2-amino acids like \u03b2-alanine and taurine (van Bree et al., Pharm. Res. 1988, 5, 369\u2013371; Cercos-Fortea et al., Biopharm. Drug. Disp. 1995, 16, 563\u2013577; Deguchi et al., Pharm. Res. 1995, 12, 1838\u20131844; Moll-Navarro et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 1996, 85, 1248\u20131254). Transport across the BBB is stereoselective, with preferential uptake of the active R-enantiomer (2) being reported (van Bree et al., Pharm. Res. 1991, 8, 259\u2013262). In addition, organic anion transporters localized in capillary endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier have been implicated in efflux of baclofen from the brain (Deguchi et al., supra; Ohtsuki et al., J. Neurochem. 2002, 83, 57\u201366). 3-(p-Chlorophenyl)pyrrolidine has been described as a CNS-penetrable prodrug of baclofen (Wall et al., J. Med. Chem. 1989, 32, 1340\u20131348). Prodrugs of other GABA analogs are described in Bryans et al., International Publication No. WO01/90052; Bryans et al., EP1178034; Cundy et al., U.S. patent application Publication No. 2002/0151529; Gallop et al., U.S. patent application Publication No. 2003/0176398; Gallop et al., U.S. patent application Publication No. 2003/0171303; Gallop et al., U.S. patent application Publication No. 2004/0006132; and Raillard et al., U.S. patent application Publication No. 2004/0014940., 327823=To a suspension of (97) (60 g, 176 mmol) in a mixture of acetonitrile and water (8:1, 400 mL) at 0\ufffd C. was added a 50% aqueous solution of hydroxylamine (13.0 mL, 211 mmol). The resulting suspension was stirred overnight at room temperature to obtain a clear solution. The bulk of the acetonitrile was removed by rotary evaporation and the residue was portioned between ethyl acetate and water. The organic phase was washed successively with water and brine, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo to afford the intermediate, 2,3-dibenzoyloxy D-tartaric acid mono-hydroxamate. This compound was suspended in toluene heated under reflux for 2 h, then cooled to room temperature to form a crystalline solid. The product was collected by filtration, washed with a mixture of ether and hexane (1:1), and dried under vacuum to afford the title compound (98) (58 g, 93%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): \u03b4 6.06 (s, 2H), 7.50 (t, 4H), 7.65 (dt, 2H), 8.06 (m, 4H). MS (ESI) m/z 354.00 (M\u2212H)\u2212., 386116=An API 2000 LC/MS/MS spectrometer equipped with Shidmadzu 10ADVp binary pumps and a CTC HTS-PAL autosampler were used in the analysis. A Phenomenex hydro-RP 4.6\ufffd50 mm column was used during the analysis. The mobile phase was water with 0.1% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (B). The gradient condition was: 10% B for 0.5 min, then to 95% B in 2.5 min, then maintained at 95% B for 1.5 min. The mobile phase was returned to 10% B for 2 min. A TurboIonSpray source was used on the API 2000. The analysis was done in positive ion mode and an MRM transition of m/z 214/151 was used in the analysis of baclofen (MRM transitions m/z 330/240 for (10), m/z 392/240 for (12), m/z 372/240 for (23), m/z 400/240 for (25), m/z 400/240 for (27), m/z 372/240 for (32), m/z 372/240 for (33), 406/240 for (40), 454/61 for (51), 400/240 for (92), 400/240 for (100) and 400/240 for (104) were used). 10 \u03bcL of the samples were injected. The peaks were integrated using Analyst 1.2 quantitation software. Following colonic administration of prodrugs (12), (23), (25), (27), (32), (33), (40), (51), (92), (100) and (104) the maximum plasma concentrations of R-baclofen (Cmax), as well as the area under the baclofen plasma concentration vs. time curves (AUC) were significantly greater (>2-fold) than that produced from colonic administration of R-baclofen itself. This data demonstrates that these compounds may be formulated as compositions suitable for enhanced absorption and/or effective sustained release of baclofen analogs to minimize dosing frequency due to rapid systemic clearance of these baclofen analogs., 215709=In still other embodiments, osmotic delivery systems are used for oral sustained release administration (Verma et al., Drug Dev. Ind. Pharm., 2000, 26:695\u2013708). In some embodiments, OROS\ufffd systems made by Alza Corporation, Mountain View, Calif. are used for oral sustained release delivery devices (Theeuwes et al, U.S. Pat. No. 3,845,770; Theeuwes et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,916,899)., 326069=To a 3 L three neck round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and teflon-coated thermocouple was added (95) (1672 g, 9 mol), isobutyric acid (264 g, 1.5 mol), and (94) (1050 g, 5.76 mol). The reaction mixture was heated to 80\ufffd C. for 12 h, monitoring the reaction progress by 1H NMR. The reaction mixture was cooled to 20\ufffd C., diluted with EtOAc (1 L) and washed with water (2\ufffd1 L), saturated NaHCO3 (1\ufffd2 L) and water (1 L). The organic phase was separated and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the product (93) (905 g, 3.9 mol, 65%) as a colorless liquid. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): \u03b4 1.0 (d, 6H), 1.2 (dd, 6H), 2.05 (m, 1H), 2.35 (s, 3H), 2.6 (m, 1H), 6.7 (d, 1H)., 339508=Pancreatin Stability: Stability studies were conducted by incubating prodrug (5 \u03bcM) with 1% (w/v) pancreatin (Sigma, P-1625, from porcine pancreas) in 0.025 M Tris buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl (pH 7.5) at 37\ufffd C. for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 2 volumes of methanol. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was removed and analyzed by LC/MS/MS., 212838=In still other embodiments, polymeric materials can be used (See \u201cMedical Applications of Controlled Release,\u201d Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Press., Boca Raton, Fla. (1974); \u201cControlled Drug Bioavailability,\u201d Drug Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, N.Y. (1984); Langer et al., 1983, J Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol Chem. 23:61; see also Levy et al., 1985, Science 228:190; During et al., 1989, Ann. Neurol. 25:351; Howard et al., 1989, J. Neurosurg. 71:105). In some embodiments, polymeric materials are used for oral sustained release delivery. Polymers include, but are not limited to, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and hydroxyethylcellulose (especially, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose). Other cellulose ethers have been described (Alderman, Int. J. Pharm. Tech. & Prod Mfr. 1984, 5(3) 1\u20139). Factors affecting drug release are well known to the skilled artisan and have been described in the art (Bamba et al., Int. J. Pharm. 1979, 2, 307)., 208640=The cores are preferably of a water-soluble or swellable material and may be any such material that is conventionally used as cores or any other pharmaceutically acceptable water-soluble or water-swellable material made into beads or pellets. The cores may be spheres of materials such as sucrose/starch (Sugar Spheres NF), sucrose crystals, or extruded and dried spheres typically comprised of excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose and lactose. The substantially water-insoluble material in the first, or sealcoat layer is generally a \u201cGI insoluble\u201d or \u201cGI partially insoluble\u201d film forming polymer (dispersed or dissolved in a solvent). Examples include, but are not limited to, ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, polymethacrylates such as ethyl acrylate/methyl methacrylate copolymer (Eudragit NE-30-D) and ammonio methacrylate copolymer types A and B (Eudragit RL30D and RS30D) and silicone elastomers. Usually, a plasticizer is used together with the polymer. Exemplary plasticizers include, but are not limited to, dibutylsebacate, propylene glycol, triethylcitrate, tributylcitrate, castor oil, acetylated monoglycerides, acetyl triethylcitrate, acetyl butylcitrate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, triacetin, fractionated coconut oil (medium-chain triglycerides). The second layer containing the active ingredient may be comprised of the active ingredient with or without a polymer as a binder. The binder, when used, is usually hydrophilic but may be water-soluble or water-insoluble. Exemplary polymers that may be used in the second layer containing the active drug are hydrophilic polymers such as, for example, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyalkylene glycol such as polyethylene glycol, gelatine, polyvinyl alcohol, starch and derivatives thereof, cellulose derivatives, such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC), hydroxypropyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethylhydroxyethyl cellulose, acrylic acid polymers, polymethacrylates, or any other pharmaceutically acceptable polymer. The ratio of drug to hydrophilic polymer in the second layer is usually in the range of from 1:100 to 100:1 (w/w). Suitable polymers for use in the third layer, or membrane, for controlling the drug release may be selected from water-insoluble polymers or polymers with pH-dependent solubility, such as, for example, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate, cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate trimellitate, polymethacrylates, or mixtures thereof, optionally combined with plasticizers, such as those mentioned above. Optionally, the controlled release layer comprises, in addition to the polymers above, other substance(s) with different solubility characteristics, to adjust the permeability and thereby the release rate, of the controlled release layer. Exemplary polymers that may be used as a modifier together with, for example, ethyl cellulose include, but are not limited to, HPMC, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyvinyl alcohol, polymers with pH-dependent solubility, such as cellulose acetate phthalate or ammonio methacrylate copolymer and methacrylic acid copolymer, or mixtures thereof. Additives such as sucrose, lactose and pharmaceutical grade surfactants may also be included in the controlled release layer, if desired., 212612=In other embodiments, an oral sustained release pump may be used (see Langer, supra; Sefton, 1987, CRC Crit Ref Biomed. Eng. 14:201; Saudek et al., 1989, N. Engl. J Med. 321:574)., 46149=This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd 119(e) from U.S. Provisional Application Ser.

No. 60/606,637 filed Aug. 13, 2004 entitled \u201cMethods for Synthesis of Acyloxyalkyl Carbamate Prodrugs\u201d which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety., 268446=To a suspension of R-baclofen hydrochloride (500 mg, 1.47 mmol) in CH2Cl2 at 0\ufffd C. was added triethylamine (0.9 mL, 6.4 mmol) and a 1N solution of chlorotrimethylsilane in CH2Cl2 (3.23 mL, 3.23 mmol). The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at 0\ufffd C. for 10 min, then was added 1-isobutanoyloxyethyl-p-nitrophenyl carbonate (577 mg, 1.94 mmol, prepared as described in Gallop et al., U.S. patent application Publ. 2003/0176398, in CH2Cl2. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 h (monitoring by LC/MS) and then diluted with CH2Cl2, washed with citric acid solution and brine, and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. After removal of solvent in vacuo, the residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel, eluting first with CH2Cl2 to remove p-nitrophenol, then with 20% ethyl acetate in hexane to afford the product in its protonated acid form as a pair of diastereomers (400 mg, 73%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): \u03b4 1.13 (m, 6H), 1.40 (m, 3H), 2.51 (m, 1H), 2.57 (dd, 1H), 2.71 (dd, 1H), 3.32 (m, 2H), 3.47 (m, 1H), 4.89 (br. s, 1H), 6.72 (q, 1H), 7.11 (d, 2H), 7.26 (d, 2H). MS (ESI) m/z 370.15 (M\u2212H)\u2212., 324531=A solution of 1-chloro-2-methylpropyl chloroformate (1026 g, 6.0 mol) and tetrabutylammonium hydrogensulfate (20 g, 60 mmol) in dichloromethane (1500 mL) in a jacketed 10 L reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer, temperature probe, and addition funnel was cooled to 10\ufffd C. To the reaction mixture was gradually added a 15% aqueous solution of sodium methylthiolate (3 L, 6.4 mol) over 4 h. The reaction was moderately exothermic and the internal temperature was maintained between 10 and 20\ufffd C. during the addition. The aqueous phase was separated and the organic phase was washed with brine (2\ufffd2 L) and water (2 L). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the title compound (94) (1050 g, 5.76 mol, 96%) as a colorless liquid. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): \u03b4 1.1 (dd, 6H), 2.2 (m, 1H), 2.4 (s, 3H), 6.35 (d, 1H)., 54340=Baclofen may be administered orally or by intrathecal delivery through a surgically implanted programmable pump. The drug is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and has an elimination half-life of approximately 3\u20134 hours. Baclofen is partially metabolized in the liver but is largely excreted by the kidneys unchanged. The short half-life of baclofen necessitates frequent administration with typical oral dosing regimens ranging from about 10 to about 80 mg of three or four divided doses daily. Plasma baclofen concentrations of about 80 to about 400 ng/mL result from these therapeutically effective doses in patients (Katz, Am. J. Phys. Med. Rehabil. 1988, 2, 108\u2013116; Krach, J. Child Neurol. 2001, 16, 31\u201336). When baclofen is given orally, sedation is a side effect, particularly at elevated doses. Impairment of cognitive function, confusion, memory loss, dizziness, weakness, ataxia and orthostatic hypotension are other commonly encountered baclofen side-effects., 197066=In some embodiments, the method of Scheme 10 is carried out in a solvent. Useful solvent include, but are not limited to, acetone, acetonitrile, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, chloroform, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidinone, dimethyl sulfoxide, pyridine, ethyl acetate, methyl tert-butyl ether, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, tert-butanol, water or combinations thereof. Preferably, the solvent is acetone, acetonitrile, dichloromethane, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, pyridine, methyl tert-butyl ether, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, water, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the solvent is a mixture of acetonitrile and water. In other embodiments, the solvent is a mixture of acetonitrile and water, with a volume ratio of acetonitrile to water from about 1:5 to about 5:1. In still other embodiments, the solvent is a mixture of methyl tert-butyl ether and water. In still other embodiments, the solvent is a mixture of methyl tert-butyl ether and water, with a volume ratio of methyl tert-butyl ether to water from about 20:1 to about 2:1. In still other embodiments, the solvent is a mixture of methyl tert-butyl ether and water, wherein the methyl tert-butyl ether contains from about 10% to about 50% acetone by volume. In still other embodiments, the solvent is dichloromethane, water or a combination thereof. In still other embodiments, the solvent is a biphasic mixture of dichloromethane and water. In still other embodiments, the solvent is a biphasic mixture of dichloromethane and water containing from about 0.001 equivalents to about 0.1 equivalents of a phase transfer catalyst. Preferably, the phase transfer catalyst is a tetraalkylammonium salt, more preferably, the phase transfer catalyst is a tetrabutylammonium salt., 334852=A 3 L three necked round bottom flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, teflon coated temperature probe and an addition funnel was charged with (93) (234 g, 1 mol), (103) (330 g, 0.95 mol), and 1,2-dichloroethane (2200 mL). The reaction mixture was cooled under a nitrogen atmosphere in an ice water bath to 15\ufffd C. To the stirred reaction mixture was added a 39% solution of peracetic acid in dilute acetic acid (500 mL, 2.94 mol) over 2 h, maintaining the temperature between 15 and 22\ufffd C. This temperature was maintained for an additional 12 h during which time a white precipitate was formed. The reaction mixture was further cooled to 3\u20134\ufffd C., the product collected by filtration, and washed with hexane (2\ufffd1 L). The product was dried in vacuo, yielding the title compound (101) (128 g, 0.24 mol, 25%). The diastereomeric purity of the product was determined to be >99% d.e. by HPLC using a chiral column. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): \u03b4 1.0 (d, 6H), 1.2 (dd, 6H), 2.1 (m, 1H), 2.65 (m, 1H), 6.0 (br. s, 2H), 6.6 (d, 1H), 7.45 (app. t, 4H), 7.65 (app. t, 2H), 8.05 (d, 4H)., 164662=In some embodiments, the hydrochloride salt of (XI) is prepared directly from (IV) by treatment with an excess of thionyl chloride or hydrogen chloride gas and alcohol R4\u2014OH (Scheme 2). Typical ratios of (IV) to thionyl chloride from between about 1:1 and about 1:20, and ratios of (IV) to alcohol from between about 1:1 and about 1:20 may be used. The reaction may be performed at temperatures between about \u221220\ufffd C. and about 25\ufffd C. The alcohol may be used as a solvent for the reaction under conditions where R4\u2014OH is a liquid. Alternatively, the reaction may be performed in a suitable solvent, such as dichloromethane, dichloroethane, chloroform, toluene, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidinone, pyridine or combinations thereof. Preferred alcohols R4\u2014OH for this reaction include arylalkyl, substituted arylalkyl and allylic alcohols. Allyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol are particularly preferred., 216130=In other embodiments, a controlled-release system can be placed in proximity of the target of a compound disclosed herein (e.g., within the spinal cord), thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (See, e.g., Goodson, in \u201cMedical Applications of Controlled Release,\u201d supra, vol. 2, pp. 115\u2013138 (1984)). Other controlled-release systems discussed in Langer, 1990, Science 249.1527\u20131533 may also be used., 217813=In other embodiments, the dosage form comprises a compound disclosed herein loaded into a polymer that releases the compound by diffusion through a polymer, or by flux through pores or by rupture of a polymer matrix. The drug delivery polymeric dosage form comprises between about 10 mg to 500 mg of compound homogenously contained in or on a polymer. The dosage form comprises at least one exposed surface at the beginning of dose delivery. The non-exposed surface, when present, is coated with a pharmaceutically acceptable material impermeable to the passage of a compound. The dosage form may be manufactured by procedures known in the art. An example of providing a dosage form comprises blending a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier like polyethylene glycol, with a known dose of a compound at an elevated temperature, (e.g., 37\ufffd C.), and adding it to a silastic medical grade elastomer with a cross-linking agent, for example, octanoate, followed by casting in a mold. The step is repeated for each optional successive layer. The system is allowed to set for about 1 hour, to provide the dosage form. Representative polymers for manufacturing the dosage form are selected from the group consisting of olefinic polymers, vinyl polymers, addition polymers, condensation polymers, carbohydrate polymer and silicone polymers as represented by polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl acetate, polymethylacrylate, polyisobutylmethacrylate, poly alginate, polyamide and polysilicone. The polymers and procedures for manufacturing them have been described in the art (Coleman et al., Polymers 1990, 31, 1187\u20131231; Roerdink et al., Drug Carrier Systems 1989, 9, 57\u201310; Leong et al., Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 1987, 1, 199\u2013233; Roff et al, Handbook of Common Polymers 1971, CRC Press; and U.S. Pat. No. 3,992,518)., 180792=Yet another method for synthesis of compounds of Formula (I) relies upon oxidation of ketocarbamate derivatives of baclofen and baclofen analogs (e.g., Gallop et al., U.S. Patent Appl. Publ. 2003/0171303; and Bhat et al., U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/893,130 entitled \u201cMethods for Synthesis of Acyloxyalkyl Compounds\u201d). As illustrated in Scheme 8, oxidation of ketocarbamate (XVIII) affords a compound of Formula (I). Methods for synthesis of compounds of Formula (XVIII) are disclosed in the pending applications, supra. Typical oxidants include those, which have been successfully used in Baeyer-Villager oxidations of ketones to esters or lactones (Strukul, Angnew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1998, 37, 1198;Renzetal., Eur. J. Org. Chem. 1999, 737; Beller et al., in \u201cTransition Metals in Organic Synthesis\u201d Chapter 2, Wiley VCH; Stewart, Current Organic Chemistry, 1998, 2, 195; Kayser et al., Synlett 1999, 1, 153). The use of anhydrous oxidants may be beneficial since prodrugs (I) may be labile. Thus, performing the oxidation under anhydrous reaction conditions may avoid hydrolysis of the reactive products., 206110=The time-release beads may be manufactured into a tablet for therapeutically effective administration. The beads can be made into matrix tablets by the direct compression of a plurality of beads coated with, for example, an acrylic resin and blended with excipients such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. The manufacture of beads has been disclosed in the art (Lu, Int. J. Pharm., 1994, 112, 117\u2013124; Pharmaceutical Sciences by Remington, 14th ed, pp 1626\u20131628 (1970); Fincher, J. Pharm. Sci. 1968, 57, 1825\u20131835; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,083,949) as has the manufacture of tablets (Pharmaceutical Sciences, by Remington, 17th Ed, Ch. 90, pp 1603\u20131625 (1985)., 55372=Intrathecal administration is often recommended for patients who find the adverse effects of oral baclofen intolerable. The intrathecal use of baclofen permits effective treatment of spasticity with doses less than 1/100th of those required orally, since administration directly into the spinal subarachnoid space permits immediate access to the GABAB receptor sites in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Surgical implantation of a pump is, however, inconvenient and a variety of mechanical and medical complications can arise (e.g., catheter displacement, kinking or blockage, pump failure, sepsis and deep vein thrombosis). Acute discontinuation of baclofen therapy (e.g., in cases of mechanical failure) may cause serious withdrawal symptoms such as hallucinations, confusion, agitation and seizures (Sampathkumar et al., Anesth. Analg. 1998, 87, 562\u2013563)., 222065=In still other embodiments, the dosage form comprises another osmotic dosage form comprising a wall surrounding a compartment, the wall comprising a semipermeable polymeric composition permeable to the passage of fluid and substantially impermeable to the passage of compound present in the compartment, a compound-containing layer composition in the compartment, a hydrogel push layer composition in the compartment comprising an osmotic formulation for imbibing and absorbing fluid for expanding in size for pushing the compound composition layer from the dosage form, and at least one passageway in the wall for releasing the prodrug composition. The method delivers the compound by imbibing fluid through the semipermeable wall at a fluid imbibing rate determined by the permeability of the semipermeable wall and the osmotic pressure across the semipermeable wall causing the push layer to expand, thereby delivering the compound from the dosage form through the exit passageway to a patient over a prolonged period of time (up to 24 or even 30 hours). The hydrogel layer composition may comprise 10 mg to 1000 mg of a hydrogel such as a member selected from the group consisting of a polyalkylene oxide of 1,000,000 to 8,000,000 weight-average molecular weight, which are selected from the group consisting of a polyethylene oxide of 1,000,000 weight-average molecular weight, a polyethylene oxide of 2,000,000 molecular weight, a polyethylene oxide of 4,000,000 molecular weight, a polyethylene oxide of 5,000,000 molecular weight, a polyethylene oxide of 7,000,000 molecular weight and a polypropylene oxide of the 1,000,000 to 8,000,000 weight-average molecular weight; or 10 mg to 1000 mg of an alkali carboxymethylcellulose of 10,000 to 6,000,000 weight average molecular weight, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose or potassium carboxymethylcellulose. The hydrogel expansion layer comprises 0.0 mg to 350 mg, in present manufacture; 0.1 mg to 250 mg of a hydroxyalkylcellulose of 7,500 to 4,500,00 weight-average molecular weight (e.g., hydroxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxybutylcellulose or hydroxypentylcellulose) in present manufacture; 1 mg to 50 mg of an agent selected from the group consisting of sodium chloride, potassium chloride, potassium acid phosphate, tartaric acid, citric acid, raffinose, magnesium sulfate, magnesium chloride, urea, inositol, sucrose, glucose and sorbitol; 0 to 5 mg of a colorant, such as ferric oxide; 0 mg to 30 mg, in a present manufacture, 0.1 mg to 30 mg of a hydroxypropylalkylcellulose of 9,000 to 225,000 average-number molecular weight, selected from the group consisting of hydroxypropylethylcellulose, hydroxypropypentylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, and hydropropylbutylcellulose; 0.00 to 1.5 mg of an antioxidant selected from the group consisting of ascorbic acid, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxyquinone, butylhydroxyanisol, hydroxycoumarin, butylated hydroxytoluene, cephalm, ethyl gallate, propyl gallate, octyl gallate, lauryl gallate, propyl-hydroxybenzoate, trihydroxybutylrophenone, dimethylphenol, dibutylphenol, vitamin E, lecithin and ethanolamine; and 0.0 mg to 7 mg of a lubricant selected from the group consisting of calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, zinc stearate, magnesium oleate, calcium palmitate, sodium suberate, potassium laurate, salts of fatty acids, salts of alicyclic acids, salts of aromatic acids, stearic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid, a mixture of a salt of a fatty, alicyclic or aromatic acid, and a fatty, alicyclic, or aromatic acid., 47299=(\ufffd)-4-Amino-3-(4-chlorophenyl)butanoic acid (baclofen), (1), is an analog of gamma-aminobutyric acid (i.e., GABA) that selectively activates GABAB receptors, resulting in neuronal hyperpolarization. GABAB receptors are located in laminae I\u2013IV of the spinal cord, where primary sensory fibers end. These G-protein coupled receptors activate conductance by K+-selective ion channels and can reduce currents mediated by Ca2+ channels in certain neurons. Baclofen has a presynaptic inhibitory effect on the release of excitatory neurotransmitters and also acts postsynaptically to decrease motor neuron firing (see Bowery, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989, 10, 401\u2013407; Misgeld et al., Prog. Neurobiol. 1995, 46, 423\u2013462)., 159730=The compounds disclosed herein may be obtained via the synthetic methods illustrated in Schemes 1\u201310 . Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that a preferred synthetic route to the disclosed compounds consists of attaching promoieties to baclofen or baclofen analogs. Numerous methods have been described in the art for the synthesis of baclofen and baclofen analogs (e.g., Keberle et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,471,548; Keberle et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,634,428; Krogsgaard-Larsen, Med. Res. Rev. 1988, 8, 27\u201356; Berthelot et al., J. Med. Chem. 1987, 30, 743\u2013746; Berthelot et al., J. Med.

Other prodrug (or related) derivatives of baclofen have been described in the art (e.g., Kaplan et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,094,992; Mazaki et al., Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo Koho JP 01319466 A2; Castagnoli et al., International Publication No. WO98/221 10; Guillon et al. Pharm. Pharmacol. Commun. 1999, 5, 243\u2013247; Leisen et al., Pharm.

General synthetic methods useful in the synthesis of the compounds described herein are available in the art (e.g., Green et al., \u201cProtective Groups in Organic Chemistry\u201d, (Wiley, 2nd ed. 1991); Harrison et al., \u201cCompendium of Synthetic Organic Methods\u201d, Vols. 1\u20138 (John Wiley and Sons, 1971\u20131996; Larock \u201cComprehensive Organic Transformations,\u201d VCH Publishers, 1989; and Paquette, \u201cEncyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis,\u201d John Wiley & Sons, 1995)., 371105=The trans-epithelial cellular permeability of prodrugs of baclofen and baclofen analogs may be assessed in vitro using standard methods well known in the art (see, e.g., Stewart, et al., Pharm. Res., 1995, 12, 693). For example, cellular permeability may be evaluated by examining the flux of a prodrug across a cultured polarized cell monolayer (e.g., Caco-2 cells). Caco-2 cells obtained from continuous culture (passage less than 28) were seeded at high density onto Transwell polycarbonate filters. Cells were maintained with DMEM/10% fetal calf serum +0.1 mM nonessential amino acids +2 mM L-Gln, 5% CO2/95% O2, 37\ufffd C. until the day of the experiment. Permeability studies were conducted at pH 6.5 apically (in 50 mM MES buffer containing 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM glucose) and pH 7.4 basolaterally (in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mM HEPES) in the presence of efflux pump inhibitors (250 \u03bcM MK-571, 250 \u03bcM Verapamil, 1 mM Ofloxacin). Inserts were placed in 12 or 24 well plates containing buffer and incubated for 30 min at 37 C\ufffd. Prodrug (200 \u03bcM) was added to the apical or basolateral compartment (donor) and concentrations of prodrug and/or released parent drug in the opposite compartment (receiver) were determined at intervals over 1 hour using LC/MS/MS. Values of apparent permeability (Papp) were calculated using the equation: P app =V r(dC/dt)//(AC o), 190665=Another method for synthesis of compounds of Formula (I), illustrated in Scheme 10, relies upon reaction of compounds of Formulae (IV) or (XI) with a 1-(acyloxy)-alkyl N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbonate compound of Formula (XXIII), as described in the co-pending application Gallop et al., U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/606,637 entitled \u201cMethods for Synthesis of Acyloxyalkyl Carbamate Prodrugs,\u201d filed Aug. 13, 2004)., 184674=A useful oxidant is anhydrous peroxytrifluoroacetic acid, generated in situ by reacting the UHP-complex with trifluoroacetic anhydride (Cooper et al., Synlett. 1990, 533\u2013535; Benjamin, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002, 124, 827\u2013833). Anhydrous peroxycarboxylic acids (XX) may generally be prepared by treating carboxylic acid anhydrides with anhydrous hydrogen peroxide, more preferably, with the UHP-complex (4). Similarly, anhydrous peroxysulfonic acids (XXII) may be prepared by reacting sulfonic acid anhydrides (XXI) with anhydrous hydrogen peroxide, preferably, with the UHP-complex (4). The preparation of anhydrous peroxycarboxylic acids (XX) and the peroxysulfonic acids (XXII) is illustrated in Scheme 9., 187295=In some embodiments, the molar ratio of the peroxyacid oxidant to the compound of Formula (XVIII) is between about 8:1 and about 1:1. In other embodiments, the molar ratio of the peroxyacid oxidant to the compound of Formula (XVIII) is between about 4:1 and about 1:1. In yet other embodiments, the molar ratio of the peroxyacid oxidant to the compound of Formula (XVIII) is between about 2:1 and about 1:1. Preferably, when the oxidant is peroxytrifluoroacetic acid or another substituted peroxyacetic acid, the molar ratio of the peroxyacid oxidant to the compound of Formula (XVIII) is about 2:1.}",
