    "textBeforeTable": "AFL MVP Recipients Olt was his stiffest competition for the award, having topped the league in both homers and RBIs, along with some other offensive categories. The Padres' Jedd Gyorko -- who won the batting title -- as well as Olt's Surprise teammates Kevin Mattison (Marlins) and Wil Myers (Royals) also received votes from the managers and coaches who determined the winner. Arenado led the AFL in hits and doubles, tied for the lead in extra-base hits, ranked second in total bases and RBIs, finished third in average, tied for third in home runs and finished fifth in slugging percentage. \"There were a lot of great players in this league,\" an appreciative Arenado said. \"Mike Olt had a really good year and [could've been the choice]. I'm just blessed that the Rockies allowed me to come out here and play.\" The Rockies' third-base prospect went to the All-Star Futures game in Phoenix in July, was a California League All-Star and led all Minor League hitters in RBIs. And on Saturday, for icing on that very large cake, Arenado was presented with the Arizona Fall League's Joe Black MVP Award prior to the championship game. SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- When Nolan Arenado has the chance to finally take a breath and look at his 2011 season, he should feel pretty good about",
    "textAfterTable": "Arenado wasn't making up for lost at-bats, or anything of that nature. The 2009 second-round Draft pick played 134 games in the California League during the regular season, amassing 517 ABs. Still, he couldn't wait for the chance to show what he could do against a higher level of competition in Arizona. \"I was tired, but I got to go home for a week before I came out here,\" Arenado said. \"I was excited. This was a great opportunity. The Rockies were sending me because they think I can play with these guys. That gives me confidence, knowing that they have confidence in me. I'm happy to be here. I've shown what I can do and I'm really thankful that they sent me here. \"I'm very happy. Baseball is a crazy game. You can go well and then you can go bad, so it's been pretty cool to be consistent through the whole thing.\" While his performance in the Fall League is obviously a small sample size, his ability to excel here -- he hit safely in 26 of 29 games and had two separate hitting streaks of 10 or more games -- has helped begin to answer the one question that some might have had about his regular-season output. It's not his fault, but any time someone puts up big numbers in the Cal League, skeptics will wonder just how much the performance was a product of his environment. \"I understood that,\" Arenado",
