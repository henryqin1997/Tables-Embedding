    "textBeforeTable": "SHSU Program Statement The Department of Family and Consumer Sciences at Sam Houston State University invites you to visit our department and explore the possibility of transferring to SHSU as a food service management major pursuing the Bachelor of Science degree. Most students enrolled in the program are preparing for careers in restaurants and other food service facilities, the food distribution industry, and county extension work. Graduates in food service management feed into an open and welcoming job market, often having networked for a suitable entry-level position through the required internship program.\u00a0 For more information, you may view the program through the department\u2019s website:\u00a0 www.shsu.edu/~hec_www.

    "textAfterTable": "Students may transfer to SHSU at any time as long as they meet SHSU's admission requirements. Students close to completing the requirements for the associate degree are encouraged to consider the potential advantages of completing the associate degree. One way to accomplish this is to transfer courses taken at SHSU back to the community college to complete degree requirements. Properly selected courses may be used to satisfy degree requirements at both institutions simultaneously. The applicant is encouraged to speak to an academic advisor familiar with the programs of all institutions involved to maximize the amount of transferable credit. ________________________________________________________________ SHSU Core Curriculum Transfer courses specific to the university major you have selected appear in the section above. Transfer students are encouraged to maximize transfer courses required for their major as described above in addition to core courses at the transfer institution. Most university majors were meant to be taken over a 4 year period. Completion of freshman and sophomore level courses in the major with appropriate core courses helps transfer students to graduate in the minimum amount of time at minimum cost. The university core appears below for the convenience of those who have not yet selected a major. If you cannot select a specific major, at least try to select the area (e.g., science, criminal justice, business, education, nursing, etc.) in which you are most likely to eventually graduate and",
