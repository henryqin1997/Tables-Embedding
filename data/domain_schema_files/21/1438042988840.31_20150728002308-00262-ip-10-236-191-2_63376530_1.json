In the three controlled studies of prevention of renal rejection, there were 298 of 1483 patients (20%) with delayed graft function. Although patients with delayed graft function have a higher incidence of certain adverse events (anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperkalemia) than patients without delayed graft function, these events were not more frequent in patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil than azathioprine or placebo. No dose adjustment is recommended for these patients; however, they should be carefully observed (see\u00a0CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics\u00a0and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)., 22746=\u00a9 2013 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.\u00a0 All rights reserved, 34487=In acute oral toxicity studies, no deaths occurred in adult mice at doses up to 4000 mg/kg or in adult monkeys at doses up to 1000 mg/kg; these were the highest doses of mycophenolate mofetil tested in these species. These doses represent 11 times the recommended clinical dose in renal transplant patients and approximately 7 times the recommended clinical dose in cardiac transplant patients when corrected for BSA. In adult rats, deaths occurred after single-oral doses of 500 mg/kg of mycophenolate mofetil. The dose represents approximately 3 times the recommended clinical dose in cardiac transplant patients when corrected for BSA., 1108=Issued: August 2013, 22662=xxxxxxx/ August 2013, 60642=Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy). The incidence of malignancies among the 1483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for \u22651 year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients., 946=\u00a9 2013 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.\u00a0 All rights reserved., 3587=Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects.

    "textBeforeTable": "Mean MPA AUC values following administration of 1 g bid intravenous mycophenolate mofetil over 2 hours to renal transplant patients for 5 days were about 24% higher than those observed after oral administration of a similar dose in the immediate posttransplant phase. In hepatic transplant patients, administration of 1 g bid intravenous mycophenolate mofetil followed by 1.5 g bid oral mycophenolate mofetil resulted in mean MPA AUC values similar to those found in renal transplant patients administered 1 g mycophenolate mofetil bid. Shown below are the mean (\u00b1SD) pharmacokinetic parameters for MPA following the administration of mycophenolate mofetil given as single doses to healthy volunteers and multiple doses to renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients. In the early posttransplant period (<40 days posttransplant), renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients had mean MPA AUCs approximately 20% to 41% lower and mean Cmax approximately 32% to 44% lower compared to the late transplant period (3 to 6 months posttransplant). Pharmacokinetics in Healthy Volunteers, Renal, Cardiac, and Hepatic Transplant Patients Mean (\u00b1SD) apparent half-life and plasma clearance of MPA are 17.9 (\u00b16.5) hours and 193 (\u00b148) mL/min following oral administration and 16.6 (\u00b15.8) hours and 177 (\u00b131) mL/min following intravenous administration, respectively. Negligible amount of drug is excreted as MPA (<1% of dose) in the urine. Orally administered radiolabeled mycophenolate mofetil resulted in complete recovery of the administered dose, with 93% of the administered dose recovered in the urine",
