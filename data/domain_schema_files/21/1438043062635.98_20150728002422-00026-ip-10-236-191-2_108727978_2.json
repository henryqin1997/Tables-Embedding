It's hard enough now to keep these names straight- it may be a typo in the newspaper that never got corrected. 2. Coincidence. Since this is the newly opened land to settlement, and the 1870's and 1880's are a big wave of Germans, so it's pure coincidence that another Geidl was here. 1. Given the crimes happen just north of Ethan, SD, we're a significant distance from the settlements of the Geidels that this blog has included up to now.

Googling his wife's unique name lead to Anna's tombstone record on Findagrave.com, which links back to the the 1880 census entry for the family living in rural Hutchinson County, Dakota Territory- east of Tripp. The same Findagrave article lists Max's birthpace as Rudershausen in Niedersachsen, which is 90 miles from the area the Geidel family came from. Coming from hometowns 90 miles apart would appear to dismiss any close relationship between the two families, especially since the Geidels immigrated some 30 years earlier. Epilogue The next day's Mitchell paper reports the eight were acquitted due to lack of evidence. When Max Geidl leaves Dakota Territory is unknown, but he shows up in 1900 in Idaho. Even if found not guilty, staying around the area would have been tough. Both the Schmidt and Bechtel murders were never solved. Posted by Alan at 7:42 PM 1 comment:",
