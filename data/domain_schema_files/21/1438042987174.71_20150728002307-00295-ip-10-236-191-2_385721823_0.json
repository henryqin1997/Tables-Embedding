Former Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani, who would have been the original choice, was barred from engaging in politics for five years after his refusal to re-open a 1990s graft case against President Zardari. From December 8 onwards, Ashraf will be making weekly public addresses around Pakistan as well as meeting with various sitting and potential parliamentarians to garner support for Zardari.[xii]\u00a0, 24631=An improvised explosive device (IED) blast on Jan Muhammad Road in Quetta injured five people on Friday. A shop was also partially destroyed. It is unclear who is responsible.[ix], 22938=2013 Elections, 31182=By the end of 2012, Pakistan is due to repatriate over 1.6 million registered Afghan refugees. aA recent survey conducted by the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), however, found that 80 percent of them have no desire to return to Afghanistan. Many families feel it is still unsafe to return, others said they would not have a place to live or any way to earn an income.[ii], 29537=On Friday, two Pakistani-born brothers arrested in Florida for planning to obtain a weapon of mass destruction and facilitating terrorism through material support pleaded not guilty to the above charges. They were arrested last week; a bail hearing is set for December 14. While few details on the plot have been publicly released, the men are alleged to have \u201cprovided money, property, lodging, communications and other support\u201d in a plot to obtain the weapon and use it somewhere in the U.S. Possible sentences range from 15 years for facilitating terrorism to life for intention to utilize a weapon of mass destruction.[iv], 32750=According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, the Afghan Taliban has recently initiated an effort to reach out to their traditional enemies, members of the Northern Alliance, in preliminary meetings to discuss the future of Afghanistan post-2014. Over a dozen senior Afghan politicians affiliated with the Northern Alliance are to travel to France for a meeting with Taliban representatives later this month.\u00a0 Senior Taliban political branch member Shahabuddin Dilawar will head the Taliban delegation. Ahmad Zia Massoud, the brother of assassinated Northern Alliance leader Ahmad Shah Massoud, said on Friday that \u201cit is very important that we know what is the position of the Taliban\u2026.We seek an understanding between us and the Taliban, to know their views and finally to pave the way to reaching peace.\u201d While the Taliban have agreed to at least meet with Northern Alliance officials, they still refuse to negotiate with Hamid Karzai. Though the upcoming meeting and future ones similar to it are unlikely to have immediate results, former Taliban foreign ministry official Wahid Muzhda stated that \u201cit\u2019s a very good opportunity for both sides to learn about each other.\u201d[i], 26131=According to security forces and civil-military liaison officials, the year 2012 has been one of the most violent in history in Karachi, with nearly 2,000 lives claimed as of late November. Reports also suggest that the Taliban are increasingly present throughout the city; in recent Supreme Court hearings, judges directed law enforcement agencies to investigate reports that more than 8,000 Taliban were operating in Karachi. Concurrently, the Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM) and the Awami National Party (ANP) are fighting to exercise political clout in the city; ANP officials say that the MQM is concerned that a growth in the Pashtun population, from which the Taliban draw their members, will undermine its influence in the city and as such, has been waging a battle against the ANP to retain power.[vii]\u00a0 \u00a0, 33575=Afghan Taliban initiate dialogue with Northern Alliance; Eighty percent of Afghan refugees in\u00a0Pakistan unwilling to be repatriated; Pakistan increasing its nuclear arsenal; Two alleged terrorist conspirators plead not guilty in WMD case; U.S. Senior Deputy Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan meets\u00a0with Pakistani officials; Ashraf reiterates Pakistani opposition to drone strikes; India accused of covering up human rights abuses in Kashmir;\u00a0 Nearly 2,000 killed in Karachi in 2012; One killed, five injured around Quetta; At least seven killed, four wounded in Karachi violence; Karachi police arrest two target killers; PM Ashraf in charge of campaigning for President Zardari in lead-up to 2013 elections.\u00a0, 24207=Police discovered three tortured bodies in a rickshaw in the Garden area of Karachi on Thursday.
