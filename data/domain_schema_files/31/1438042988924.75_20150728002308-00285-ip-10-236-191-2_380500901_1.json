Both things will be nessary, if you want to flash your own version of Coreboot onto your Chromebook (in-system). It is nessary to close a circuit on the motherboard via either a jumper or a srew to disable the write-protection of the spi chip. And to use the flashing tool flashrom in ChromeOs, you have to be in the developer-mode. If you already installed a Gnu/Linux-system or likely you can also use the flashrom from there (but then you would be in developer-mode anyway). A good place to start is the Chromium site. They have guides howto set your Chromebook into developer-mode and disassembly guides for almost all Chormebooks. Start Flashing your own Coreboot-version and Payload onto your device is do-able, but requires some hardware preperation.
