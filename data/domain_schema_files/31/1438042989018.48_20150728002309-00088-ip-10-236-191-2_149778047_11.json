If the comment is a general disparagement of image enhancement, then I would suggest you include references to instances where this technique was applied without problems in similar Item #2430 (15 Jan 1995 14:05) - Image enhancement From: \"k.a. rogers\" <krogers@JULIAN.UWO.CA> Subject: Image enhancement in our presentation of our images.
