    "textBeforeTable": "Open repeaters on Oahu are (starting at Diamond Head and moving clockwise around the island): flexible j-pole antenna from 300 ohm TV twinlead is strongly recommended, unless you know exactly which hotel room you will be getting. A note to visitors staying at hotels in Waikiki. The popular repeaters located on Diamond Head are located on the northeast side of the crater rim at elevation 440 feet. Waikiki is on the southwest side of Diamond Head at sea level, so you're in probably the worst location trying to access those repeaters. Building heights are restricted to 350 feet, so you won't have line of sight with the repeaters from the Waikiki hotels. You'll need a good antenna, a good location (such as a large window or lanai (balcony) at least one watt (preferrably five watts or more) of power, and good elevation to get above the nearby hotels. An external antenna, such as a magnetic mount antenna and aluminum foil for ground plane or EARC Repeaters on Diamond Head 146.880 The daily net is at 7:30 pm local time. If you are visiting and staying in Waikiki, tune to Hawaii State RACES Inter-island VHF repeater system Enjoy, and feel free to drop",
