It has been estimated that the population was about 100 million in 1600 and remained nearly static until the late 19th century. It reached 255 million according to the first census taken in 1881.[12][13], 111052=Source: United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs website > World Population Prospects: The 2010 revision.[56], 138460=72.2%; male: 381,668,992, female: 360,948,755 (2001 census), 138595=0\u201314 years: 30.8%; male: 188,208,196, female: 171,356,024 15\u201364 years: 64.3%; male: 386,432,921, female: 364,215,759 65+ years: 4.9%; male: 27,258,259, female: 30,031,289 (2007 est.), 136696=1,166,079,217 (July 2009 est. CIA);[62] 1,210 million (2011 census)[63], 138978=1.548% (2009 est.), 60405=Some activists believe India's 2011 census shows a serious decline in the number of girls under the age of seven - activists fear eight million female foetuses may have been aborted between 2001 and 2011.[47] These claims are controversial. Scientists who study human sex ratios and demographic trends suggest that birth sex ratio between 1.08 to 1.12 can be because of natural factors, such as the age of mother at baby's birth, age of father at baby's birth, number of babies per couple, economic stress, endocrinological factors, etc.[48] The 2011 census birth sex ratio in India, of 917 girls to 1000 boys, is similar to 870-930 girls to 1000 boys birth sex ratios observed in Japanese, Chinese, Cuban, Filipino and Hawaiian ethnic groups in the United States between 1940 to 2005. They are also similar to birth sex ratios below 900 girls to 1000 boys observed in mothers of different age groups and gestation periods in the United States.[49][50], 16982=Studies of India's population since 1881 have focused on such topics as total population, birth and death rates, growth rates, geographic distribution, literacy, the rural and urban divide, cities of a million, and the three cities with populations over eight million: Delhi, Greater Mumbai (Bombay), and Kolkata (Calcutta).[14], 8118=India has more than 50% of its population below the age of 25 and more than 65% below the age of 35. It is expected that, in 2020, the average age of an Indian will be 29 years, compared to 37 for China and 48 for Japan; and, by 2030, India's dependency ratio should be just over 0.4.[8], 148900=According to a 2009 study published by Reich et al., the modern Indian population is composed of two genetically divergent and heterogeneous populations which mixed in ancient times (about 1,200-3,500 BC), known as Ancestral North Indians (ANI) and Ancestral South Indians (ASI). ASI corresponds to the Dravidian-speaking population of southern India, whereas ANI corresponds to the Indo-Aryan-speaking population of northern India.[81][82], 53613=^1 including Bah\u00e1'\u00eds, Jews, and Parsis. Tribal Animists (and non religious) are included after 1926 (1931 census onwards), 6691=India is the second most populous country in the world, with over 1.271 billion people (2015), more than a sixth of the world's population. Already containing 17.5% of the world's population, India is projected to be the world's most populous country by 2025, surpassing China, its population reaching 1.6 billion by 2050.[5][6] Its population growth rate is 1.2%, ranking 94th in the world in 2013.[7] The Indian population had reached the billion mark by 1998., 48844=The table below summarizes India's demographics (excluding Mao-Maram, Paomata and Purul subdivisions of Senapati District of Manipur state due to cancellation of census results) according to religion at the 2001 census in per cent. The data is \"unadjusted\" (without excluding Assam and Jammu and Kashmir); The 1981 census was not conducted in Assam and the 1991 census was not conducted in Jammu and Kashmir., 18984=India's population has exceeded that of the entire continent of Africa by 200 million people.[19] However, because Africa's population growth is nearly double that of India, it is expected to surpass both China and India by 2025., 141838=Scheduled castes: 16.6% (2011 census);[71][72] scheduled tribes: 8.6% (2011 census), 125280=The below table gives the vital statistics (Births, Deaths, IMR and NGR) for the year 2010, according to the Registrar Gen., India.[61], 140404=2.72 children born/woman (2009 est.), although more up-to-date statistics indicate that India's TFR was 2.6 in 2008[66], 143631=India is projected to overtake China as the world's most populous nation by 2030. India's population growth has raised concerns that it would lead to widespread unemployment and political instability.[75][76] Note that these projections make assumptions about future fertility and death rates which may not turn out to be correct in the event. Fertility rates also vary from region to region, with some higher than the national average and some lower., 139685=\u22120.05 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2007 est.), 18137=India occupies 2.4% of the world's land area but supports over 17.5% of the world's population. At the 2001 census 72.2% of the population[16] lived in about 638,000 villages[17] and the remaining 27.8%[16] lived in more than 5,100 towns and over 380 urban agglomerations.[18], 139802=At birth: 1.12 male(s)/female Under 10 years: 1.14 male(s)/female 15\u201324 years: 1.09 male(s)/female 24\u201364 years: 1.06 male(s)/female 65 years and over: 0.908 male(s)/female Total population: 1.08 male(s)/female (2011 est.), 139505=22% (2006 est.)}",
