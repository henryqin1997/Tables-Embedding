Experience matters, no question. But experience has never been as important as the combination of ability and success. Cooper has been a rock star at every level since going into coaching; he\u2019s experienced nothing but success. While team success is an imperfect measure of coaching ability, the evidence strongly suggests that Cooper is highly capable. The facts that he is an educated man and a Western Canadian to boot (Cooper\u2019s originally from Prince George) don\u2019t hurt him either. The Oilers have a chance to land a home run here. There are a variety of excellent candidates available, but none as compelling as Cooper. I don\u2019t get a vote when the Oilers hire their next head coach, but if I",
