Dixon's other titles came in 2003 and 2008. Honda-powered Tristan Vautier also claimed series Rookie of the Year honors., 125708=Dixon came to the 19th and final race of the 2013 season with a 25-point lead over Castroneves, including a series-leading four wins this year. A finish of fifth or better would have secured the title for Dixon, but he worked his Target Chip Ganassi Racing Dallara Honda to the front of the field, and battled for the lead for much of the night, until backing off in the final laps due to rising engine temperatures as Will Power went on to claim the victory., 130862=Art St. Cyr (President, Honda Performance Development) on tonight's race and the 2013 IndyCar Series season: \"It was an exciting end to an exciting season that saw us win our 200th Indy car race, but somewhat bittersweet, as well. Congratulations to Scott [Dixon] on his third drivers' championship, and Honda's 15th Indy car drivers' title. Congratulations to all of our Honda and HPD associates for their incredible work throughout the season. We're already looking forward to the start of the 2014 season, which for all of us begins tomorrow.\", 118109=Circuit: Auto Club Speedway (2.0-mile oval).

We started well back and had to work on the car a fair bit in the early stages of the race to make it better. Just a huge credit to the team, the changes we made all worked and the car was quite quick, until we had an issue with some overheating towards the end. I still can't believe we won the championship. Mid-year, I did not think we had a chance of doing this, but it all turned around at Pocono [where Dixon scored Honda's 200th Indy car victory]. We dug deep and Honda stepped up, and together we made it happen.\", 130140=Charlie Kimball (#83 Novo Nordisk Chip Ganassi Racing Honda Dallara) started 4th, finished 10th: \"First of all, major congratulations to Scott [Dixon] for winning the championship and to the Chip Ganassi Racing organization as a whole. The goal tonight was for Scott to clinch the title in the #9 car and we were able to do that. We were able to run up front and prove that our #83 car was quick, too. It was unfortunate to have a mechanical failure that close to the end. We had a good restart, the car was getting better and better, and we were in good shape for the end of the race. Overall, we're looking forward to the 2014 season and what the future holds.\"}",
