    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{8952=In the early 1930s, the philosophical implications of the current interpretations of quantum theory troubled many prominent physicists of the day, including Albert Einstein. In a well-known 1935 paper, Boris Podolsky and co-authors Einstein and Nathan Rosen (collectively \"EPR\") sought to demonstrate by a paradox that QM was incomplete. This provided hope that a more-complete (and less-troubling) theory might one day be discovered. But that conclusion rested on the seemingly reasonable assumptions of locality and realism (together called \"local realism\" or \"local hidden variables\", often interchangeably). In the vernacular of Einstein: locality meant no instantaneous (\"spooky\") action at a distance; realism meant the moon is there even when not being observed. These assumptions were hotly debated in the physics community, notably between Nobel laureates Einstein and Niels Bohr., 30340=The title of Bell's seminal article refers to the 1935 paper by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen[15] that challenged the completeness of quantum mechanics. In his paper, Bell started from the same two assumptions as did EPR, namely (i) reality (that microscopic objects have real properties determining the outcomes of quantum mechanical measurements), and (ii) locality (that reality in one location is not influenced by measurements performed simultaneously at a distant location). Bell was able to derive from those two assumptions an important result, namely Bell's inequality. The theoretical (and later experimental) violation of this inequality implies that at least one of the two assumptions must be false., 31237=In two respects Bell's 1964 paper was a step forward compared to the EPR paper: firstly, it considered more hidden variables than merely the element of physical reality in the EPR paper; and Bell's inequality was, in part, liable to be experimentally tested, thus raising the possibility of testing the local realism hypothesis. Limitations on such tests to date are noted below. Whereas Bell's paper deals only with deterministic hidden variable theories, Bell's theorem was later generalized to stochastic theories[16] as well, and it was also realised[17] that the theorem is not so much about hidden variables, as about the outcomes of measurements that could have been taken instead of the one actually taken. Existence of these variables is called the assumption of realism, or the assumption of counterfactual definiteness., 65725=Most advocates of the hidden-variables idea believe that experiments have ruled out local hidden variables. They are ready to give up locality, explaining the violation of Bell's inequality by means of a non-local hidden variable theory, in which the particles exchange information about their states. This is the basis of the Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics, which requires that all particles in the universe be able to instantaneously exchange information with all others. A 2007 experiment ruled out a large class of non-Bohmian non-local hidden variable theories.[22], 70654=There have also been repeated claims that Bell's arguments are irrelevant because they depend on hidden assumptions that, in fact, are questionable\u2014though none of these claims have ever achieved much support. For example, E. T. Jaynes[26] claimed in 1989 that there are two hidden assumptions in Bell's theorem that could limit its generality. According to him:, 10418=In his groundbreaking 1964 paper, \"On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen paradox\",[4][6] physicist John Stewart Bell presented an analogy (based on spin measurements on pairs of entangled electrons) to EPR's hypothetical paradox. Using their reasoning, he said, a choice of measurement setting here should not affect the outcome of a measurement there (and vice versa). After providing a mathematical formulation of locality and realism based on this, he showed specific cases where this would be inconsistent with the predictions of QM theory., 3621=Bell summarized one of the least popular ways to address the theorem, superdeterminism, in a 1985 BBC Radio interview:, 60991=The fair sampling problem was faced openly in the 1970s. In early designs of their 1973 experiment, Freedman and Clauser[19] used fair sampling in the form of the Clauser\u2013Horne\u2013Shimony\u2013Holt (CHSH[18]) hypothesis. However, shortly afterwards Clauser and Horne[16] made the important distinction between inhomogeneous (IBI) and homogeneous (HBI) Bell inequalities. Testing an IBI requires that we compare certain coincidence rates in two separated detectors with the singles rates of the two detectors. Nobody needed to perform the experiment, because singles rates with all detectors in the 1970s were at least ten times all the coincidence rates. So, taking into account this low detector efficiency, the QM prediction actually satisfied the IBI. To arrive at an experimental design in which the QM prediction violates IBI we require detectors whose efficiency exceeds 82.8% for singlet states,[20] but have very low dark rate and short dead and resolving times. This is now within reach., 29290=Bell's theorem, derived in his seminal 1964 paper titled On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen paradox,[4] has been called, on the assumption that the theory is correct, \"the most profound in science\".[13] Perhaps of equal importance is Bell's deliberate effort to encourage and bring legitimacy to work on the completeness issues, which had fallen into disrepute.[14] Later in his life, Bell expressed his hope that such work would \"continue to inspire those who suspect that what is proved by the impossibility proofs is lack of imagination.\"[14], 64444=While early experiments used atomic cascades, later experiments have used parametric down-conversion, following a suggestion by Reid and Walls,[21] giving improved generation and detection properties. As a result, the most recent experiments with photons no longer suffer from the detection loophole (see Bell test experiments). This makes the photon the first experimental system for which all main experimental loopholes have been surmounted, albeit presently only in separate experiments (Giustina et al. (2013), Bell violation using entangled photons without the fair-sampling assumption, Nature 497, 227\u2013230; B.G. Christensen et al. (2013), Detection-Loophole-Free Test of Quantum Nonlocality, and Applications, arXiv:1306.5772)., 76347=In well-defined Bell experiments (see the paragraph on \"test experiments\") one can now falsify either quantum mechanics or Einstein's quasi-classical assumptions: currently many experiments of this kind have been performed, and the experimental results support quantum mechanics, though some point out that it is theoretically possible that detectors give a biased sample of photons, so that until the relative number of \"unpaired\" photons is small enough, the final word has not yet been spoken. According to Marek Zukowski, quoted in Science Magazine (2011),[9] experimenters expect the first loophole free experiment to be done in five years. According to one of the foremost experimentalists in this field, Anton Zeilinger (2013), the goal of a loophole free experiment is very close and will be a major achievement. According to Gregor Weihs (University of Innsbruck and conducted a 1998 Bell test experiment) at least four major experimental groups around the world are in the race to be first. In 2014, Jason Gallicchio, Andrew Friedman, and David Kaiser published a paper in Physical Review letters proposing an experiment to close the free will loophole that uses light from quasars at opposite directions in the sky (which have therefore not had any contact or communication since the Big Bang) to decide on the settings of particle detectors. As Kaiser explains it, an experiment would go something like this: A laboratory setup would consist of a particle generator, such as a radioactive atom that emits pairs of entangled particles. One detector measures a property of particle A, while another detector does the same for particle B. A split second after the particles are generated, but just before the detectors are set, scientists would use telescopic observations of distant quasars to determine which properties each detector will measure of a respective particle. In other words, quasar A determines the settings to detect particle A, and quasar B sets the detector for particle B.[35]}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Measuring the spin of these entangled particles along anti-parallel directions\u2014i.e., along the same axis but in opposite directions, the set of all results is perfectly correlated. On the other hand, if measurements are performed along parallel directions they always yield opposite results, and the set of measurements shows perfect anti-correlation. Finally, measurement at perpendicular directions has a 50% chance of matching, and the total set of measurements is uncorrelated. These basic cases are illustrated in the table below. The probability of the same result being obtained at the two locations varies, depending on the relative angles at which the two spin measurements are made, and is strictly between zero and one for all relative angles other than perfectly parallel alignments (0\u00b0 or 180\u00b0). Bell's theorem is concerned with correlations defined in terms of averages taken over very many trials of the experiment. The correlation of two binary variables is usually defined in quantum physics as the average of the product of the two outcomes of the pairs of measurements. Note that this is different from the usual definition of correlation in statistics. The quantum physicist's \"correlation\" is the statistician's \"raw (uncentered, unnormalized) product moment\". They are similar in that, with either definition, if the pairs of outcomes are always the same, the correlation is +1; if the pairs of outcomes are always opposite, the correlation is -1; and if the pairs of outcomes agree 50% of the",
    "textAfterTable": "The best possible local realist imitation (red) for the quantum correlation of two spins in the singlet state (blue), insisting on perfect anti-correlation at zero degrees, perfect correlation at 180 degrees. Many other possibilities exist for the classical correlation subject to these side conditions, but all are characterized by sharp peaks (and valleys) at 0, 180, 360 degrees, and none has more extreme values ( \u00b10.5) at 45, 135, 225, 315 degrees. These values are marked by stars in the graph, and are the values measured in a standard Bell-CHSH type experiment: QM allows local realism predicts \u00b10.5 or less. With the measurements oriented at intermediate angles between these basic cases, the existence of local hidden variables could agree with a linear dependence of the correlation in the angle but, according to Bell's inequality (see below), could not agree with the dependence predicted by quantum mechanical theory, namely, that the correlation is the negative cosine of the angle. Experimental results match the curve predicted by quantum mechanics.[1] Over the years, Bell's theorem has undergone a wide variety of experimental tests. However, various common deficiencies in the testing of the theorem",
