The study consisted of 15 one-on-one interviews, each lasting between 45 and 60 minutes. 10 of these interviews were conducted in person at a lab facility and 5 were conducted remotely from the Wikipedia Usability Office. The interviews were conducted in late March 2009 in San Francisco, CA.}",

The changes users were able to make included correcting typos and grammar, adding words and sentences, copying and pasting, and formatting text (with bold and italics). The ease of editing around wiki markup drastically decreased as the complexity of the article increased\u2014most notably when articles started with large infoboxes, templates, and other syntax-heavy elements.}",

From 2,500 users, we ended up with 10 study participants and 3\u20135 waitlisted participants. We recruited over 2,500 San Francisco residents for the in person testing.
