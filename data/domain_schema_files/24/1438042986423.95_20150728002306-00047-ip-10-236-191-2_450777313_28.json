Both in 1990 and between 1998 and 2008 the nonlinear forecasting model proved persistently less accurate out of sample than the AR(4) benchmark. Only in 2009 is that ranking reversed again in favor of the nonlinear model. Given that the financial crisis occurred immediately after a major surge in the price of oil, but itself was presumably not caused by that oil price surge, the obvious concern is that the nonlinear model may have forecast the 2008 recession for the wrong reasons., 218027=Greenspan, A.

Figure 8 therefore focuses on an alternative time series of 1-quarter and 4-quarters-ahead forecasts of the U.S. nominal refiners' acquisition cost for imported crude oil. These data were collected from the EIA's Short-term Economic Outlook, which is published by the U.S. Department of Energy. Given the difference in frequency and oil price definition the results are not strictly speaking comparable with our earlier analysis of the monthly WTI price. Nevertheless, these data are illuminating. Figure 8 illustrates that even these expert forecasts generally underpredicted the price of crude oil between 2004 and mid-2008, especially at longer horizons, while overpredicting it following the collapse of the price of oil in mid-2008 and underpredicting it again more recently. A natural question is how the EIA forecasts compare to the no-change forecast on the basis of the EIA's preliminary data releases for the current refiners' acquisition cost for imported crude oil. The latter data are provided by the same source. The DM test for equal predictive accuracy in Table 11 suggests that the MSPE ratio of 0.92 for the 1-quarter-ahead forecast is statistically significant at the 10% level, but the MSPE ratio of 0.97 for the 4-quarters-ahead forecast is not. We conclude that even the EIA has had at best modest success in forecasting the nominal price of oil in the short run and none at longer horizons., 373037=16.\u00a0\u00a0 This index is constructed from ocean shipping freight rates. The idea of using fluctuations in shipping freight rates as indicators of shifts in the global real activity dates back to Isserlis (1938) and Tinbergen (1959). The panel of monthly freight-rate data underlying the global real activity index was collected manually from Drewry's Shipping Monthly using various issues since 1970. The data set is restricted to dry cargo rates. The earliest raw data are indices of iron ore, coal and grain shipping rates compiled by Drewry's. The remaining series are differentiated by cargo, route and ship size and may include in addition shipping rates for oilseeds, fertilizer and scrap metal. In the 1980s, there are about 15 different rates for each month; by 2000 that number rises to about 25; more recently that number has dropped to about 15. The index was constructed by extracting the common component in the nominal spot rates. The resulting nominal index is expressed in dollars per metric ton, deflated using the U.S. CPI and detrended to account for the secular decline in shipping rates. For this paper, this series has been extended based on the Baltic Exchange Dry Index, which is available from Bloomberg. The latter index, which is commonly discussed in the financial press, is essentially identical to the nominal index in Kilian (2009a), but only available since 1985.\u00a0Return to text, 222152=Kilian, L. (2009a), \"Not all Oil Price Shocks Are Alike: Disentangling Demand and Supply Shocks in the Crude Oil Market,\" American Economic Review, 99, 1053-1069., 93054=One concern with the results in Table 10 is that the most traded oil futures contracts are the June and December contracts. This suggests focusing on the most liquid daily contracts rather than averaging results across all daily contracts, as we did in Table 10. Below we report sensitivity analysis for this subset of daily oil futures contracts. Because long-term futures contracts only became available in recent years and because their use greatly reduces the effective sample size, we focus on June and December contracts with maturities of one, two and three years. Based on the evaluation period of 1998-2010, we find that one-year contracts have an MSPE ratio of 0.91 compared with the no-change forecast, two-year contracts an MSPE ratio of 1.01 and three-year contracts an MSPE ratio of 1.27. These results are qualitatively similar to those in Table 10 for the same maturities, suggesting that there are no gains in forecast accuracy from restricting the sample., 379222=26.\u00a0\u00a0 The refiners' acquisition cost was extrapolated back to 1973.2 as in Barsky and Kilian (2002).\u00a0Return to text, 226461=Pindyck, R.S. (1991), \"Irreversibility, Uncertainty and Investment,\" Journal of Economic Literature, 29, 1110-1148., 119451=The first study to investigate this question is Baumeister and Kilian (2011) who recently developed a real-time data set for the variables in question. They find (based on a data set extending until 2010.6) that VAR forecasting models of the type considered in this section can generate substantial improvements in real-time forecast accuracy. The MSPE reduction for unrestricted VAR models may be as high as 25% at the one-month horizon and as high as 9% at the three-month horizon. At longer horizons the MSPE reductions diminish even for the best VAR models. Beyond one year, the no-change forecast usually has lower MSPE than the VAR model. Baumeister and Kilian also show that VAR forecasting models based on Kilian and Murphy (2010) exhibit significantly improved directional accuracy. The improved directional accuracy persists even at horizons at which the MSPE gains have vanished. The success ratios range from 0.51 to 0.60, depending on the model specification and horizon., 101310=The last panel of Figure 6 shows that, notwithstanding this improved long-horizon forecast accuracy, households committed systematic forecast errors during the most recent oil price surge. Between 1998 and 2004, households persistently underestimated the price of gasoline. This evidence may help explain the continued popularity of SUVs, light trucks and other energy-inefficient automobiles during this period. Presumably, consumers would not have chosen to buy as many SUVs, had they foreseen the subsequent increase in gasoline prices at the time of their purchase decision., 365627=**\u00a0\u00a0We thank Christiane Baumeister for providing access to the world and OECD industrial production data and Ryan Kellogg for providing the Michigan survey data on gasoline price expectations.

This result is in striking contrast to the pre-1973 period. As shown in Hamilton (1983) using quarterly data and in Gillman and Nakov (2009) using monthly data, there is no significant Granger causality from U.S. inflation to the percent change in the nominal price of oil in the 1950s and 1960s. This difference in results is suggestive of a structural break in late 1973 in the predictive relationship between the price of oil and the U.S. economy., 243920=Figure 10: Real Price of Oil in Different Currencies 1999.1-2009.12, 337513=Table 16: Recursive MSPE Ratios for the Real Price of Oil from Selected Bayesian VAR Models, Evaluation Period: 1991.12-2009.8, 367554=3.\u00a0\u00a0 In related work, Dvir and Rogoff (2010) present formal evidence of a structural break in the process driving the annual real price of oil in 1973. Given this evidence of instability, combining pre- and post-1973 real oil price data is not a valid option.\u00a0Return to text, 20072=Another argument in the literature has been that the nominal price of oil can be considered exogenous after 1973 because it is set by OPEC. This interpretation is without basis. First, there is little evidence to support the notion that OPEC has been successfully acting as a cartel in the 1970s and early 1980s, and the role of OPEC has diminished further since 1986 (see, e.g., Skeet 1988; Smith 2005; Almoguera, Douglas and Herrera 2010). Second, even if we were to accept the notion that an OPEC cartel sets the nominal price of oil, economic theory predicts that this cartel price will endogenously respond to U.S. macroeconomic conditions. This theoretical prediction is consistent with anecdotal evidence of OPEC oil producers raising the price of oil (or equivalently lowering oil production) in response to unanticipated U.S. inflation, low U.S. interest rates and the depreciation of the dollar. Moreover, as observed by Barsky and Kilian (2002), economic theory predicts that the strength of the oil cartel itself (measured by the extent to which individual cartel members choose to deviate from cartel guidelines) will be positively related to the state of the global business cycle (see Green and Porter 1984). Thus, both nominal and real oil prices must be considered endogenous with respect to the global economy, unless proven otherwise., 130099=The second scenario involves a recovery of global demand for oil and other industrial commodities. We ask how an unexpected surge in the demand for oil similar to that occurring during 2007.1-2008.6, but starting in 2009.9, would affect the real price of oil. This scenario involves feeding into the structural moving average representation future flow demand shocks corresponding to the sequence of flow demand shocks that occurred in 2007.1-2008.6, while setting all other future structural shocks equal to their expected value of zero. Figure 9 shows a persistent increase in the real price of oil starting in early 2010 that peaks in early 2011 about 50% above the price of oil in 2009.8. Taking the no-change forecast as the baseline forecast, this means that the peak occurs at a price of about 100 dollars. Alternatively, one could express these results relative to the unconditional VAR forecast., 24797=As with other oil price specifications there is reason to expect lagged feedback from global macroeconomic aggregates to the net oil price increase. Whereas Hamilton (2003) made the case that net oil price increases in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s were capturing exogenous events in the Middle East, Hamilton (2009) concedes that the net oil price increase of 2003-08 was driven in large part by a surge in the demand for oil. Kilian (2009a,b; 2010), on the other hand, provides evidence based on structural VAR models that in fact most net oil price increases have contained a large demand component driven by global macroeconomic conditions, even prior to 2003. This finding is also consistent with the empirical results in Baumeister and Peersman (2010)., 26532=Granger causality from macroeconomic aggregates to the price of oil has received attention in part because Granger non-causality is one of the testable implications of strict exogeneity. The notion that the percent change in the nominal price of oil may be considered exogenous with respect to the U.S. economy was bolstered by evidence in Hamilton (1983), who observed that there is no apparent Granger causality from U.S. domestic macroeconomic aggregates to the percent change in the nominal price of oil during 1948-1972. Of course, the absence of Granger causality is merely a necessary condition for strict exogeneity. Moreover, a failure to reject the null of no Granger causality is at best suggestive; it does not establish the validity of the null hypothesis. Hamilton's case for the exogeneity of the nominal price of oil with respect to the U.S. economy therefore rested primarily on the unique institutional features of the oil market during this period, discussed in section 2, and on historical evidence that unexpected supply disruptions under this institutional regime appear to be associated with exogenous political events in the Middle East, allowing us to treat the resulting price spikes as exogenous with respect to the U.S. economy. For a more nuanced view of these historical episodes see Kilian (2008b; 2009a,b; 2010). Even if we accept Hamilton's interpretation of the pre-1973 period, the institutional conditions that Hamilton (1983) appeals to ceased to exist in the early 1970s, and Hamilton's results for the 1948-1972 period are mainly of historical interest. The real question for our purposes is to what extent there is evidence that oil prices can be predicted from macroeconomic aggregates in the post-1973 period., 206615=We showed that there is reason to be skeptical of the seeming forecasting success of many nonlinear models during the recent financial crisis. In particular, if the one-year forecasts are to be believed, the financial crisis played almost no role in the economic decline of 2008/09, which does not seem economically plausible. An alternative explanation is that the evaluation sample is too short for reliable inference and that these results reflect overfitting. We observed that net oil price increase models have a tendency to predict major economic declines anytime the price of oil has increased substantially. Although such predictions repeatedly proved incorrect, most notably in 2005/06, the ability of some three-year net increase models to forecast the extreme decline of 2008/09 under quadratic loss more than compensates for earlier forecasting errors and accounts for the higher average out-of-sample forecast accuracy of these models for U.S. real GDP growth., 170664=Our approach in this section has been parametric. Alternatively, one could have used nonparametric econometric models to investigate the forecasting ability of the price of oil for real GDP. In related work, Bachmeier, Li and Liu (2008) used the integrated conditional moment test of Corradi and Swanson (2002, 2007) to investigate whether oil prices help forecast real GDP growth one-quarter ahead. The advantage of this approach is that - while imposing linearity under the null - it allows for general nonlinear models under the alternative; the disadvantage is that the test is less powerful than the parametric approach if the parametric structure is known. Bachmeier et al. report a p-value of 0.20 for the null that nominal net increases in the WTI price of oil do not help forecast U.S. real GDP. The p-value for percent changes in the WTI price of crude oil is 0.77. Similar results are obtained for real net increases and for percent changes in the real WTI price. These findings are broadly consistent with ours. Bachmeier et al. (2008) also report qualitatively similar results using a number of fully nonparametric approaches. An obvious caveat is that their analysis is based on data since 1949, which is not appropriate for the reasons discussed earlier, and ends before the 2008/09 recession. Using their nonparametric techniques on our much shorter sample period does not seem advisable, however, because there is no way of controlling the size of the test., 167368=It is usually thought that out-of-sample forecasts protect against overfitting. The example of 2008/09 illustrates that this need not be the case. Under quadratic loss the ability of the nonlinear model to predict correctly the sharp economic decline associated with the financial crisis may more than offset the sustained poor forecasting accuracy of this nonlinear model during earlier episodes not involving smaller forecasting errors. Only additional data will ultimately resolve this question. If the near-simultaneous occurrence of the financial crisis and the oil price surge is coincidental, then the forecasting accuracy of the nonlinear model can be expected to worsen, as the sample is extended. If the forecasting success of the nonlinear model were to persist even after the financial crisis is over, this would add credibility to the nonlinear real GDP growth forecasts., 107328=There are no theoretical results in the forecasting literature on how to assess the null of equal predictive accuracy when comparing iterated AR or ARMA forecasts to the no-change forecast. In particular, the standard tests discussed in Clark and McCracken (2001, 2005) or Clark and West (2007) are only designed for direct forecasts. Below we assess the significance of the MSPE reductions based on bootstrap p-values for the MSPE ratio constructed under the null of a random walk model without drift.27 The upper panel of Table 12 suggests that AR and ARMA models in log levels have lower recursive MSPE than the no-change forecast at short horizons. The accuracy gains may approach 17% in some cases and are highly statistically significant. Beyond the six-month horizon, all gains in forecast accuracy evaporate. There also are statistically significant gains in directional accuracy at horizons 1 and 3, and in some cases at horizon 6. There is little to choose between the AR(12), ARMA(1,1), AR(SIC) and AR(AIC) specifications overall. The AR(24) model has slightly better directional accuracy at longer horizons, but at the cost of a higher MSPE ratio., 314=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System International Finance Discussion Papers Number 1022, July 2011 --- Screen Reader Version*, 208557=Finally, we showed that oil price volatility measures commonly used to characterize predictive densities for the price of oil are not adequate measures of the risks faced by market participants. We demonstrated how appropriate risk measures can be constructed. Those risk measures, however, are only as good as the underlying forecasting models and would not have provided any advance warning of the collapse of the real price of oil in late 2008, for example., 346218=Table 17b: Recursive Forecast Error Diagnostics for the Real Price of Oil (by Country), Evaluation Period: 1991.12-2009.8 - WTI, 141107=The real price of oil is obtained by deflating the refiners' acquisition cost for imported crude oil by the U.S. CPI.

One argument for the use of nominal oil prices has been that the nominal price of oil - unlike the real price of oil - is exogenous with respect to U.S. macroeconomic conditions and hence linearly unpredictable on the basis of lagged U.S. macroeconomic conditions.5 This argument may have some merit for the pre-1973 period, but is implausible for the post-1973 period. If the U.S. money supply unexpectedly doubles, for example, then, according to standard macroeconomic models, so will all nominal prices denominated in dollars (including the nominal price of oil), leaving the relative price or real price of crude oil unaffected (see Gillman and Nakov 2009). Clearly, one would not want to interpret such an episode as an oil price shock involving a doubling of the nominal price of oil. Indeed, economic models of the impact of the price of oil on the U.S. economy correctly predict that such a nominal oil price shock should have no effect on the U.S. economy because theoretical models inevitably are specified in terms of the real price of oil, which has not changed in this example., 61878=Tables 4 through 8 assess the predictive accuracy of various forecasting models against the benchmark of a random walk without drift for horizons of 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. The forecast evaluation period is 1991.1-2009.12 with suitable adjustments, as the forecast horizon is varied. The assessment of which forecasting model is most accurate may depend on the loss function of the forecaster (see Elliott and Timmermann 2008). We report results for the MSPE and the relative frequency with which a forecasting model correctly predicts the sign of the change in the spot price based on the success ratio statistic of Pesaran and Timmermann (2009). We formally test the null hypothesis that a given candidate forecasting model is as accurate as the random walk without drift against the alternative that the candidate model is more accurate than the no-change forecast. Suitably constructed p-values are shown in parentheses (as described in the notes to Table 4). It should be noted that commonly used tests of equal predictive accuracy for nested models (including the tests we rely on in this chapter) by construction are tests of the null of no predictability in population rather than tests of equal out-of-sample MSPEs (see, e.g., Inoue and Kilian 2004a,b; Clark and McCracken 2010). This means that these tests will reject the null of equal predictive accuracy more often than they should under the null, suggesting caution in interpreting test results that are only marginally statistically significant. We will discuss this point in more detail further below. This concern does not affect nonnested forecast accuracy comparisons., 164701=The corresponding lower panel in Figure 12 shows that the net increase model (23') is even more successful at forecasting the downturn of 2008 and the subsequent recovery four quarters ahead. If anything, this nonlinear model appears too successful in that it seems to leave little independent role for the financial crisis. The forecasting success in 2008, however, comes at a price because model (23') on earlier occasions forecast a number of economic declines that did not materialize or were not nearly as severe as predicted by the model. For example, in panel (b), the net increase model incorrectly forecast pronounced declines in economic growth relative to average growth in 2005/06 and the economic decline of 1990/91 began long before the forecasted decline., 211624=Bernanke, B.S (2004), \"Oil and the Economy,\" Speech presented at Darton College, Albany, GA, http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2004/20041021/default.htm., 15851=Figure 3 once more highlights the striking differences between the pre- and post-1973 period. It shows the percent growth rate of the real price of oil. A major structural change in the distribution of the price of oil in late 1973 is readily apparent.3 Whereas the pre-1973 period is characterized by long periods of low volatility interrupted by infrequent large positive price spikes, the post-1973 period is characterized by high month-to-month volatility. It has been suggested that perhaps this volatility has increased systematically after the collapse of OPEC in late 1985. The answer is somewhat sensitive to the exact choice of dates. If one were to date the OPEC period as 1973.10-1985.12, for example, there is no evidence of an increase in the variance of the percent change in the real WTI price of oil. The volatility in the OPEC period is virtually identical to that in the post-OPEC period of 1986.1-2010.6. Shifting the starting date of the OPEC period to 1974.1, in contrast, implies a considerable increase in volatility after 1985. Extending the ending date of the OPEC period to include the price collapse in 1986 induced by OPEC actions, which seems reasonable, on the other hand, renders the volatility much more similar across subperiods. Finally, combining the earlier starting date and the later ending date, there is evidence of a reduction in the real price volatility after the collapse of OPEC rather than an increase. Below we therefore treat the post-1973 data as homogeneous., 305915=Table 9: Short-Horizon Forecasts of the Nominal WTI Price of Oil from Daily Oil Futures Prices since January 1986, Start of Evaluation Period January 1986, 60483=The objective is to compare the real-time forecast accuracy of models (1)-(6). Our empirical analysis is based on daily prices of crude oil futures traded on the NYMEX from the commercial provider Price-Data.com. The time series begins in March 30, 1983, when crude oil futures were first traded on the NYMEX, and extends through December 31, 2009. Contracts are for delivery at Cushing, OK. Trading ends four days prior to the 25th calendar day preceding the delivery month. If the 25th is not a business day, trading ends on the fourth business day prior to the last business day before the 25th calendar day. A common problem in constructing monthly futures prices of a given maturity is that an h-month contract may not trade on a given day. We identify the h-month futures contract trading closest to the last trading day of the month and use the price associated with that contract as the end-of-month value. Our approach is motivated by the objective of computing in a consistent manner end-of-month time series of oil futures prices for different maturities. This allows us to match up end-of-month spot prices and futures prices as closely as possible. The daily spot price data are obtained from the webpage of the Energy Information Administration and refer to the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil available for delivery at Cushing, OK., 88183=These results lead us to revise somewhat our earlier findings. We conclude that there is statistically significant evidence that oil futures prices improve on the accuracy of the no-change forecast of the nominal price of oil at the 1-year horizon, but not at shorter horizons. The magnitude of these gains in accuracy is modest - at least by the standards of the literature on forecasting macroeconomic aggregates such as inflation rates. Moreover, there are indications that this result is sensitive to changes in the sample period and may not be robust as more data accumulate. After eliminating the data beyond March 2008, for example, the MSPE ratio of the 12-month futures price exceeds 1 and only when extending the sample period beyond July 2008 is the MSPE reduction statistically significant. This result, together with the lack of evidence for slightly shorter or slightly longer futures contracts, suggests caution in interpreting the evidence for the 12-month contract in Table 9., 239444=Figure 8: EIA Forecasts of the U.S. Refiners' Acquisition Cost for Imported Crude Oil 1983.Q1-2009.Q4, 204836=One of the main reasons for the importance that many macroeconomists attach to the price of oil is its perceived predictive power for U.S. real GDP. Assessing that predictive power requires a joint forecasting model for the price of oil and for domestic real activity. We showed that there are only small gains in using the price of oil in forecasting cumulative real GDP growth from VAR models. This finding is robust to whether the price of oil is specified in nominal or in real terms and whether it is treated as exogenous or endogenous. More importantly, linear autoregressive models fail to predict major economic downturns. One possible explanation of this forecast failure is that the predictive relationship is nonlinear. We therefore evaluated and compared a wide range of nonlinear joint forecasting models for the price of oil and real GDP growth. Except for the three-year net oil price increase specification, we found no evidence at all of substantially improved forecast accuracy for real GDP growth. Even for the three-year net increase model, the evidence was mixed at best. For example, we found no evidence that the nominal PPI three-year net increase model is more accurate than linear models for real GDP growth at the one-quarter horizon. A multivariate generalization of the model proposed by Hamilton (2003, 2010) tended to provide MSPE gains of up to 12% relative to the AR(4) benchmark model at longer horizons. Even more accurate results were obtained with some alternative oil price series. All these forecasting successes, however, were driven entirely by the 2008/09 recession. Excluding that episode from the evaluation period, even the most accurate nonlinear model was less accurate than the benchmark AR(4) model for real GDP growth., 223197=Kilian, L., and S. Manganelli (2008), \"The Central Banker as a Risk Manager: Estimating theFederal Reserve's Preferences under Greenspan,\" Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 40, 1103-1129., 168263=The same concern regarding the financial crisis episode arises to varying degrees with other oil price series. Table 20 provides a systematic comparison of the performance of nonlinear forecasting models relative to the AR(4) benchmark model for real GDP growth for different oil price series and evaluation periods. To conserve space, we focus on models (23) and (23') which tend to be the most accurate nonlinear forecasting models. Table 20 shows that the relative MSPE of nonlinear forecasting models can be highly sensitive to the choice of oil price series. The first two columns of Table 20 focus on the evaluation period 1990.Q1-2010.Q2. Column (1) shows that, for eight of ten model specifications, the one-quarter ahead nonlinear forecasting model proposed by Hamilton (2010) fails to outperform the AR(4) benchmark model for real GDP. Only for the real refiners' acquisition cost for imported crude oil and for the nominal WTI specification are there any gains in forecast accuracy. In particular, the nominal PPI specification favored by Hamilton (2010) on the basis of in-sample diagnostics is less accurate than the AR benchmark model. Much more favorable results are obtained at the one-year horizon in column (2) of Table 20. All but one nonlinear forecasting model yields reductions in the MSPE, although the extent of these reductions greatly differs across models and can range from negligible to substantial. However, all evidence of forecast accuracy gains vanishes if the financial crisis episode is excluded, as shown in columns (3) and (4) of Table 20. Some nonlinear forecasting models have more than twice the MSPE of the AR benchmark model. We conclude that the evidence that nonlinear oil price transformation help forecast cumulative U.S. real GDP growth is mixed at best., 72404=Given the significance of crude oil to the international economy, it is surprising that there are few organizations that produce monthly forecasts of spot prices. In the oil industry, where the spot price of oil is critical to investment decisions, producers tend to make annual forecasts of spot prices for horizons as long as 15-20 years, but these are not publicly available. The U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA) has published quarterly forecasts of the nominal price of oil since 1983. The Economist Intelligence Unit has produced annual forecasts since the 1990s for horizons of up to 5 years. None of these sources provides monthly forecasts., 44285=Another likely explanation of the failure to reject the null of no predictability is model misspecification. It is well known that Granger causality in a bivariate model may be due to an omitted third variable, but equally relevant is the possibility of Granger noncausality in a bivariate model arising from omitted variables (see L\u00fctkepohl 1982). This possibility is more than a theoretical curiosity in our context. Recent models of the determination of the real price of oil after 1973 have stressed that this price is determined in global markets (see, e.g., Kilian 2009a; Kilian and Murphy 2010). In particular, the demand for oil depends not merely on U.S. demand, but on global demand. The bivariate model for the real price of oil and U.S. real GDP by construction omits fluctuations in real GDP in the rest of the world. The relevance of this point is that offsetting movements in real GDP abroad can easily offset the effect of changes in U.S. real GDP, obscuring the dynamic relationship of interest and lowering the power of the Granger causality test. Only when real GDP fluctuations are highly correlated across countries would we expect U.S. real GDP to be a good proxy for world real GDP.15 In addition, as the U.S. share in world GDP evolves, by construction so do the predictive correlations underlying Table 2. In this regard, Kilian and Hicks (2010) have documented dramatic changes in the PPP-adjusted share in GDP of the major industrialized economies and of the main emerging economies in recent years that cast further doubt on the U.S. real GDP results in Table 2. For example, today, China and India combined have almost as high a share in world GDP as the United States., 368995=7.\u00a0\u00a0 Hamilton (1994, p. 306) illustrates this point in the context of a model of stock prices and expected dividends. \u00a0Return to text, 176162=It may seem that fluctuations in oil price volatility, defined in this manner, would be a good indicator of changes in oil price risks. It is important not to equate risk and uncertainty, however. Whereas the latter may be captured by the volatility of oil price forecasts, the former cannot. The standard risk that financial markets in oil-importing economies are concerned with is the risk of excessively high oil prices. That risk in general will be at best weakly correlated with the volatility of oil price forecasts because any reduction in risk, as the price of oil falls, all else equal, will be associated with increased oil price volatility. This is why in 1986, for example, oil price volatility increased, as OPEC collapsed and the price of oil dropped sharply, whereas by all accounts consumers were pleased with lower oil prices and the diminished risk of an OPEC induced supply disruption. Hence, standard volatility measures are of limited use as summary statistics for the predictive distribution of oil price forecasts. We defer to section 12.3 for a more detailed exposition of how appropriate risk measures may be computed from the predictive distribution of the price of oil., 37747=One reason that the pre-1973 predictive regressions differ from the post-1973 regressions is that prior to 1973 the nominal price of oil was adjusted only at discrete intervals (see Figure 1). Because the nominal oil price data was generated by a discrete-continuous choice model, conventional vector autoregressions by construction are not appropriate for testing predictability. One way of illustrating this problem is by fitting a random walk model with drift to these data and plotting randomly generated draws from the fitted model against the actual data. Figure 4 shows one such sequence. Without loss of generality, Figure 4 illustrates that the fitted time series model model - like any conventional time series model - is unable to replicate the discontinuous adjustment process underlying the pre-1973 WTI data. This is true even allowing for leptokurtic error distributions. In other words, autoregressive or moving average time series processes are inappropriate for these data and tests based on such models have to be viewed with caution., 15025=Figure 2 shows the corresponding oil price data adjusted for U.S. CPI inflation. The left panel reveals that in real terms the price of oil had been falling considerably since the late 1950s. That decline was corrected only by the sharp rise in the real price of oil in 1973/74. There has been no pronounced trend in the real price of oil since 1974, but considerable volatility. The definition of the real price of oil is of lesser importance after 1986. Prior to 1986, one key difference is that the refiners' acquisition cost for imported crude oil fell in 1974-76, whereas the real WTI price rose. A second key difference is that the real WTI price spiked in 1980, whereas the real price of oil imports remained largely stable. That pattern was only reversed with the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq War in late 1980., 220951=International Monetary Fund 2005. World Economic Outlook, Washington, DC., 12842=Figure 1 plots alternative measures of the nominal price of oil. The longest available series is the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price of crude oil. Data on U.S. refiners' acquisition cost for domestically produced oil, for imported crude oil and for a composite of these series are available starting in 1974.1. Figure 1 highlights striking differences in the time series process for the price of oil prior to 1973 and after 1973. The WTI data until 1973 tend to exhibit a pattern resembling a step-function. The price remains constant for extended periods, followed by discrete adjustments. The U.S. wholesale price of oil for 1948-1972 used in Hamilton (1983) is numerically identical with this WTI series. As discussed in Hamilton (1983, 1985) the discrete pattern of crude oil price changes during this period is explained by the specific regulatory structure of the oil industry during 1948-72. Each month the Texas Railroad Commission and other U.S. state regulatory agencies would forecast demand for oil for the subsequent month and would set the allowable production levels for wells in the state to meet demand. As a result, much of the cyclically endogenous component of oil demand was reflected in shifts in quantities rather than prices. The commission was generally unable or unwilling to accommodate sudden disruptions in oil production, preferring instead to exploit these events to implement sometimes dramatic price increases (Hamilton 1983, p. 230)., 233391=Figure 4: The Impossibility of Modeling Pre-1973 WTI Data as an ARMA Process, 378092=24.\u00a0\u00a0 A question of obvious interest is how the survey predictor compares with the price of gasoline futures. That comparison is not feasible due to data limitations. The longest maturity in the NYMEX gasoline futures market is 3 years, and the 3-year futures contract only became available in 2007.\u00a0Return to text, 369229=8.\u00a0\u00a0 In the former case, the pre-1974.1 observations are only used as pre-sample observations.\u00a0Return to text, 262439=1Data source: U.N. Monthly Bulletin of Statistics. These data end in 2008.III because the U.N. has temporarily suspended updates of this series, resulting in a shorter evaluation period., 97368=Recently, Anderson, Kellogg and Sallee (2010) obtained a previously unused data set from the Michigan Survey of Consumers on U.S. households' expectations of gasoline prices. The survey asks consumers about how many cents per gallon they think gasoline prices will increase or decrease during the next five years compared to now. Median responses are available for 1984.10-2010.1, but there are gaps in the data, preventing the construction of a continuous monthly time series. Expectations data may be constructed by adding the expected change in the price of gasoline to the current monthly U.S. city average retail price of gasoline (quoted in cents per gallon including taxes), as reported by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The upper panel of Figure 6 shows that the median 5-year survey forecast systematically exceeds the current gasoline price. The magnitude of the gap varies over time., 73098=A source of monthly forecasts of the price of crude oil is Consensus Economics Inc., a U.K.-based company that compiles private sector forecasts in a variety of countries. Initially, the sample consisted of more than 100 private firms; it now contains about 70 firms. Of interest to us are the survey expectations for the 3- and 12-month ahead spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil, which corresponds to the type and grade delivered under the NYMEX futures contract. The survey provides the arithmetic average, the minimum, the maximum, and the standard deviation for each survey month beginning in October 1989 and ending in December 2009. We use the arithmetic mean at the relevant horizon:, 201084=We also found strong evidence that after 1973 the real price of oil is predictable in population based on fluctuations in global real output, as suggested by standard economic theory. We illustrated how problems of omitted variables and of mismeasurement can obscure this predictive relationship. We emphasized the importance of accounting for structural changes in the composition of real output, of using measures with broad geographic coverage, and of using methods of detrending that can capture long swings in the demand for industrial commodities., 381528=31.\u00a0\u00a0 In related work, Ramey and Vine (2010) propose an alternative adjustment to the price of gasoline that reflects the time cost of queuing in gasoline markets during the 1970s. That adjustment as well serves to remove a nonlinearity in the transmission process. Both the nonlinearity postulated in Edelstein and Kilian (2009) and that postulated in Ramey and Vine (2010) is incompatible with the specific nonlinearity embodied in the models of Mork (1989) and Hamilton (1996, 2003). In fact, the aforementioned papers rely on linear regressions after adjusting the energy price data.\u00a0Return to text, 331304=Table 15: Recursive Forecast Error Diagnostics for the Real Price of Oil from Selected Unrestricted VAR Models WTI, Evaluation Period: 1991.12-2009.8, 228754=Wu, T., and A. McCallum (2005), \"Do Oil Futures Prices Help Predict Future Oil Prices?\" Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Economic Letter, 2005-38., 28347=There is widespread agreement among oil economists that, starting in 1973, nominal oil prices must be considered endogenous with respect to U.S. macroeconomic variables (see Kilian 2008a). Whether this endogeneity makes the nominal price of oil predictable on the basis of lagged U.S. macroeconomic aggregates depends on whether the price of oil behaves like a typical asset price or not. In the former case, one would expect the nominal price of oil to incorporate information about expected U.S. macroeconomic conditions immediately, rendering the nominal price of oil linearly unpredictable on the basis of lagged U.S. macroeconomic aggregates. This line of reasoning is familiar from the analysis of stock and bond prices as well as exchange rates.7 In the latter case, the endogeneity of the nominal price of oil with respect to the U.S. economy implies that lagged changes in U.S. macroeconomic aggregates have predictive power for the nominal price of oil in the post-1973 data (see, e.g., Cooley and LeRoy 1985)., 164013=An obvious question of interest is to what extent allowing for nonlinearities improves our ability to forecast major economic downturns in the U.S. The one-quarter ahead results in the upper panel of Figure 12 indicate that the nominal net increase model has considerable success in forecasting the 2008 recessions, about half of which is forecast by the model, but the model's performance during other episodes is less impressive. For example, its performance during the oil price shock episode of 1990/91 is erratic. Although the model forecasts a recession, the timing is off and the model forecasts sharp subsequent oscillations in economic growth that did not materialize., 3395=There is widespread agreement that unexpected large and persistent fluctuations in the real price of oil are detrimental to the welfare of both oil-importing and oil-producing economies. Reliable forecasts of the price of oil are of interest for a wide range of applications. For example, central banks and private sector forecasters view the price of oil as one of the key variables in generating macroeconomic projections and in assessing macroeconomic risks. Of particular interest is the question of the extent to which the price of oil is helpful in predicting recessions. For example, Hamilton (2009), building on the analysis in Edelstein and Kilian (2009), provides evidence that the recession of late 2008 was amplified and preceded by an economic slowdown in the automobile industry and a deterioration in consumer sentiment. Thus, more accurate forecasts of the price of oil have the potential of improving forecast accuracy for a wide range of macroeconomic outcomes and of improving macroeconomic policy responses., 210619=Barsky, R.B., and L. Kilian (2002), \"Do We Really Know that Oil Caused the Great Stagflation? A Monetary Alternative,\" in: NBER Macroeconomics Annual 2001, B.S. Bernanke and K. Rogoff (eds.), MIT Press: Cambridge, MA, 137-183., 219007=Hamilton, J.D. (2009), \"Causes and Consequences of the Oil Shock of 2007-08,\" Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 1, Spring, 215-261., 50496=Although none of the proxies for global fluctuations in demand is without limitations, we conclude that there is a robust pattern of Granger causality, as we correct for problems of model misspecification and of data mismeasurement that undermine the power of the test. This conclusion is further strengthened by evidence in Kilian and Hicks (2010) based on distributed lag models that revisions to professional real GDP growth forecasts have significant predictive power for the real price of oil during 2000.11-2008.12 after weighting each country's forecast revision by its PPP-GDP share. Predictability in population, of course, does not necessarily imply out-of-sample forecastability (see Inoue and Kilian 2004a). The next two sections therefore examine alternative approaches to forecasting the nominal and the real price of oil out-of-sample., 128789=We consider three scenarios of economic interest. The forecast horizon is 24 months for illustrative purposes. The first scenario involves a successful stimulus to U.S. oil production, as had been considered by the Obama administration prior to the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Here we consider the likely effects of a 20% increase in U.S. crude oil output in 2009.9, after the estimation sample of Kilian and Murphy (2010) ends. This is not to say that such a dramatic and sudden increase would be feasible, but that it would be a best-case scenario. Such a U.S. oil supply stimulus would translate to a 1.5% increase in world oil production, which is well within the variation of historical data. We simulate the effects of such a stimulus by calibrating a one-time structural oil supply shock such that the impact response of global oil production growth in 2009.9 is 1.5%. All other future structural shocks are set to zero. Figure 9 shows that the resulting reduction in the real price of oil expressed in percent relative to the baseline forecast is negligible. Even a much larger U.S. oil supply stimulus would do little to affect the forecast of the real price of oil, suggesting that policies aimed at creating such a stimulus will be ineffective at lowering the real price of oil., 175145=Figure 15 plots all three volatility measures on the same scale. Although all three measures agree that by far the largest volatility peak occurred near the end of 2008, there are important differences. For example, the implied volatility measure increases steadily starting in early 2008 and peaks in December 2008. Realized volatility also peaks in December 2008, but does not increase substantially the second half of 2008. Finally, GARCH volatility is even slower to increase in 2008 and only peaks in January 2009. This ranking is consistent with the view that implied volatility is the most forward-looking volatility measure and GARCH volatility the most backward-looking volatility estimate (and hence the least representative measure of real time volatility). Similarly, the implied volatility and realized volatility measures indicate substantial secondary spikes in volatility in 2001/02 and 2003, whereas the spikes in the GARCH volatility estimate are much smaller and occur only with a delay., 250407=Figure 14: 12-Month Ahead Predictive Density of the Real WTI Price of Oil as of 2009.12 Based on No-Change Forecast, 200518=A natural starting point for our analysis was the question of whether the price of oil is inherently unpredictable, as is sometimes claimed. We provided strong evidence that after 1973 the nominal price of oil is predictable in population, consistent with economic theory. The most successful predictors are recent percent changes in U.S. consumer prices and monetary aggregates as well as global non-oil industrial commodity prices. An even better predictor is the recent percent change in the bilateral dollar exchange rate of major commodity exporters., 194323=It is worth emphasizing that none of these 12-month-ahead risk forecasts provided any warning of the collapse of the real price of oil in late 2008. To the extent that the collapse in the real price of oil was unpredictable based on past data, this is not surprising. The problem is not with the risk measures but rather with the underlying predictive distribution that these risk measures have been applied to. Although the predictive distribution based on the no-change forecast is among the best available approaches to forecasting the real price of oil, this is a useful reminder that even the best available approach need not be very accurate in practice., 214655=Davies, P. (2007), \"What's the Value of an Energy Economist?\" Presentation at the 30th Annual Conference of the International Association for Energy Economics, Wellington, New Zealand, February 18., 199754=In this chapter, our objective has been to provide a benchmark based on data that include the recent collapse of the price of oil in 2008 and its subsequent recovery. We started by discussing problems with combining data from the pre-1973 and post-1973 period, highlighting the need to discard the pre-1973 data because these data cannot be represented by standard time series models. We documented a structural break in the time series process of both the nominal and the real price of oil in late 1973. We also noted the presence of a structural break in the dynamic correlations between changes in the real price of oil and U.S. real GDP growth. That structural break invalidates predictive regressions based on data extending back further than 1973., 172237=Point forecasts of the price of oil are important, but they fail to convey the uncertainty associated with oil price forecasts. That uncertainty is captured by the predictive density. Figure 14 plots the 12-month ahead predictive density for the real price of oil as of 2009.12, generated from the no-change forecasting model. Although it is obvious that there is tremendous uncertainty about the future real price of oil, even when using the best available forecasting methods, it is less obvious how to convey and interpret that information. For example, standard questions in the financial press about whether the price of oil could increase to $200 a barrel, at the risk of being misunderstood, inevitably and always must be answered in the affirmative because the predictive distribution has infinite support. That answer, however, is vacuous because it does not convey how likely such an event is or by how much the price of oil is expected to exceed the $200 threshold in that event., 382234=32.\u00a0\u00a0 Some preliminary evidence on this question has been provided by Ravazzolo and Rothman (2010) and by Carlton (2010). It is not straightforward to compare their results to those in Tables 19 and 20, however. Not only is their analysis based on one-step-ahead real GDP growth forecasts from single-equation predictive models evaluated at the relevant forecasting horizon (rather than iterated forecasts from multivariate models), but it is based on a sample period that includes pre-1973 data.\u00a0Return to text, 30259=Predictability in the context of linear vector autoregressions may be tested using Granger causality tests. Table 1a investigates the evidence of Granger causality from selected nominal U.S. macroeconomic variables to the nominal price of oil. All results are based on pairwise vector autoregressions. The lag order is fixed at 12. Similar results would have been obtained with 24 lags. We consider four alternative nominal oil price series. The evaluation period is alternatively 1973.1-2009.12 or 1975.1-2009.12.8 It is not clear a priori which oil price series is best suited for finding predictability. On the one hand, one would expect the evidence of predictability to be stronger for oil price series that are unregulated (such as the refiners' acquisition cost for imported crude oil) than for partially regulated domestic price series. On the other hand, to the extent that the 1973/74 oil price shock episode was driven by monetary factors, as proposed by Barsky and Kilian (2002), one would expect stronger evidence in favor of such feedback from the WTI price series that includes this episode., 222815=Kilian, L., and B. Hicks (2010), \"Did Unexpectedly Strong Economic Growth Cause the Oil Price Shock of 2003-2008?\" mimeo, Department of Economics, University of Michigan., 38811=This problem with the pre-1973 data may be ameliorated by deflating the nominal price of oil, which renders the oil price data continuous and more amenable to VAR analysis (see Figure 2). Additional problems arise, however, when combining oil price data generated by a discrete-continuous choice process with data from the post-Texas Railroad Commission era that are fully continuous. Concern over low power has prompted many applied researchers to combine oil price data for the pre-1973 and post-1973 period in the same model when studying the predictive relationship from macroeconomic aggregates to the price of oil. This approach is obviously inadvisable when dealing with nominal oil price data, as already discussed. Perhaps less obviously, this approach is equally unappealing when dealing with vector autoregressions involving the real price of oil. The problem that the nature and speed of the feedback from U.S. macroeconomic aggregates to the real price of oil differs by construction, depending on whether the nominal price of oil is temporarily fixed or not. This instability manifests itself in a structural break in the predictive regressions commonly used to test for lagged potentially nonlinear feedback from the real of price of oil to real GDP growth (see, e.g., Balke, Brown and Y\u00fccel 2002). The p-value for the null hypothesis that there is no break in 1973.Q4 in the coefficients of this predictive regression is 0.001 (see Kilian and Vigfusson 2010b).12 For that reason, regression estimates of the relationship between the real price of oil and domestic macroeconomic aggregates obtained from the entire post-war period are not informative about the strength of these relationships in post-1973 data.13 In the analysis of the real price of oil below we therefore restrict the evaluation period to start no earlier than 1973.1., 238235=Figure 7: Consensus Economics Expectations of Nominal Price of Oil (Dollars/Barrel) 1989.10-2009.12, 132270=It is natural to focus on forecasting the real price of oil in dollars because crude oil is traded in dollars. This perspective, however, is too limited. From the point of European oil importers, for example, it is the real price of oil in Euros that matters. Figure 10 shows the real price of oil between 1991.1 and 2009.12 in the U.S., the Euro zone, Japan, the U.K. and Canada. These data have been constructed from the U.S. refiners' acquisition cost for imported crude oil with the help of data on nominal exchange rates and consumer prices. For expository purposes all data have been expressed in log deviations from their mean over this sample period. Although the overall picture is similar, Figure 10 illustrates that there can be substantial differences in the real price of oil across countries at times. For example, the real exchange rate cushioned the increase in the real price of oil experienced by the Euro area in 2007/08, but amplified it in 2000/01., 17436=Which price series is more appropriate for the analysis of post-1973 data depends in part on the purpose of the study. The WTI price data (as well as other measures of the domestic U.S. price of oil) are questionable to the extent that these prices were regulated until the mid-1980s and do not reflect the true scarcity of oil or the price actually paid by U.S. refiners. The refiners' acquisition cost for imported crude oil provides a good proxy for oil price fluctuations in global oil markets, but may not be representative for the price that U.S. refineries paid for crude oil. The latter price may be captured better by a composite of the acquisition cost of domestic and imported crude oil, neither of which, however, is available before January 1974. The real price of oil imports, nevertheless, is the price relevant for theories interpreting oil price shocks as terms-of-trade shocks. Theories that interpret oil price shocks as allocative disturbances, on the other hand, require the use of retail energy prices, for which the composite refiners' acquisition cost may be a proxy. Below we will consider several alternative oil price series.4, 74683=Further analysis shows that until 2008.12 the consensus survey forecast had a much higher MSPE than the no-change forecast at both the 3-month and 12-month horizons. This pattern changes only toward the end of the sample. There is evidence that the accuracy of the consensus survey forecasts improves at the 12-month horizon, especially in 2009 as the oil market recovers from its collapse in the second half of 2008. It appears that professional forecasters correctly predicted a long-term price recovery in this instance, although they were not successful at predicting the timing of the 2009 recovery. Notwithstanding these caveats, there is no compelling evidence overall that survey forecasts outperform the no-change forecast., 109650=All models in Table 12 have in common that the information set is restricted to past values of the real price of oil. The question we turn to next is whether suitably chosen macroeconomic predictors can be used to improve further on the no-change forecast. Recently, a number of structural vector autoregressive models of the global market for crude oil have been proposed (see, e.g., Kilian 2009). These models produce empirically plausible estimates of the impact of demand and supply shocks in the oil market. A natural conjecture is that such models may also have value for forecasting. Here we focus on the reduced-form representation of the VAR model in Kilian and Murphy (2010). The sample period is 1973.2-2009.8. The variables in this model include the percent change in global crude oil production, the global real activity measure we already discussed in section 4, the log of the real price of oil, and a proxy for the change in global above-ground crude oil inventories. For further discussion of the data see Kilian and Murphy (2010). The VAR model may be consistently estimated without taking a stand on whether the real price of oil is I(0) or I(1) (see Sims, Stock and Watson 1990). We focus on recursive rather than rolling regression forecasts throughout this section. This approach makes sense in the absence of structural change, given the greater efficiency of recursive regressions and the small sample size.28, 42750=Notwithstanding this presumption, Table 2 indicates no evidence of Granger causality from U.S. real GDP growth to the real price of oil. This finding is robust to alternative methods of detrending and alternative lag orders. In the absence of instantaneous feedback from U.S. real GDP to the real price of oil, a finding of Granger noncausality from U.S. real GDP to the real price of oil - in conjunction with evidence that the real price of oil Granger causes U.S. real GDP - would be consistent with the real price of oil being strictly exogenous with respect to U.S. real GDP. It can be shown, however, that the evidence of Granger causality from the real price of oil to U.S. real GDP is not much stronger. When linear detrending (LT), Hodrick-Prescott-filtering (HP) and log-differencing (DIF) the data, which each transformation applied symmetrically to both time series in a bivariate VAR(4) model, there is only one marginal rejection at the 10% level. This rejection occurs for the real WTI price in differences when evaluated on the 1973.I-2009.IV period. There are no rejections using other data transformations or shorter evaluation periods. The fact that there are few rejections, if any, in either direction suggests that the Granger noncausality test may simply lack power for samples of this length. In fact, this is precisely the argument that prompted some researchers to combine data from the pre-1973 and post-1973 period - a strategy that we do not recommend for the reasons discussed in section 4.1.3., 32448=Gillman and Nakov view changes in inflation in the post-1973 period as rooted in persistent changes in the growth rate of money.10 Thus, an alternative approach of testing the hypothesis of Gillman and Nakov (2009) is to focus on Granger causality from monetary aggregates to the nominal price of oil. Given the general instability in the link from changes in monetary aggregates to inflation, one would not necessarily expect changes in monetary aggregates to have much predictive power for the price of oil, except perhaps in the 1970s (see Barsky and Kilian 2002). Table 1a nevertheless shows that there is considerable lagged feedback from narrow measures of money such as M1 for the refiners' acquisition cost and the WTI price of oil based on the 1975.2-2009.12 evaluation period. The much weaker evidence for the full WTI series may reflect the stronger effect of regulatory policies on the WTI price during the early 1970s. The evidence for broader monetary aggregates such as M2 having predictive power for the nominal price of oil is much weaker, with only one test statistically significant., 173305=One seemingly natural way of summarizing the information in the predictive distribution is to report the variability of the forecasts. Interest in oil price volatility measures arises, for example, from financial analysts interested in pricing options and from portfolio managers interested in diversifying risks. Given that at short horizons CPI inflation is negligible, it is customary in financial applications to focus on nominal oil price volatility. One approach to measuring oil price volatility is to rely on the implied volatilities of put and call options, which are available from January 1989 on. Implied volatility measures are computed as the arithmetic average of the daily implied volatilities from the put and call options associated with a futures contract of a given maturity. The upper panel of Figure 15 shows the 1-month implied volatility time series for 2001.1-2009.12, computed from daily CRB data, following the same procedure as for the spot and futures prices in section 5. Alternatively, we may use daily percent changes in the nominal WTI price of oil to construct measures of realized volatility, as shown in the second panel of Figure 15 (see, e.g., Bachmeier, Li and Liu 2008). Finally, yet another measure of volatility can be constructed from parametric GARCH or stochastic volatility models. The bottom panel of Figure 15 shows the 1-month-ahead conditional variance obtained from recursively estimated Gaussian GARCH(1,1) models.33 The initial estimation period is 1974.1-2000.12. The estimates are based on the percent change in the nominal WTI price; the corresponding results for the real WTI price are almost indistinguishable at the 1-month horizon.34, 243159=NOTES: All results are based on the structural oil market model of Kilian and Murphy (2010). The U.S. oil production stimulus involves a 20% increase in U.S. oil production in 2009.9, which translates to a 1.5% increase in world oil production. For this purpose, a one-time structural oil supply shock is calibrated such that the impact response of global oil production is 1.5%. The 2007-08 world recovery scenario involves feeding in as future shocks the sequence of flow demand shocks that occurred in 2007.1-2008.6. The Iran 1979 speculation scenario involves feeding in as future shocks the speculative demand shocks that occurred between 1979.1 and 1980.2 and were a major contributor to the 1979/80 oil price shock episode., 131014=Finally, we consider the possibility of a speculative frenzy such as occurred starting in mid-1979 after the Iranian Revolution (see Kilian and Murphy 2010). This scenario involves feeding into the model future structural shocks corresponding to the sequence of speculative demand shocks that occurred between 1979.1 and 1980.2 and were a major contributor to the 1979/80 oil price shock episode. Figure 9 shows that this event would raise the baseline forecast temporarily by as much as 30%. Most of the effects would have dissipated by mid-2011., 228261=Tinbergen, J. (1959). \"Tonnage and Freight\" in: Jan Tinbergen Selected Papers, Amsterdam: North Holland, 93-111., 84422=Note that the daily data are sparse in that there are many days for which no price quotes exist. We eliminate these dates from the sample and stack the remaining observations similar to the approach taken in Kilian and Vega (2010) in the context of modeling the impact of U.S. macroeconomic news on the nominal price of oil. Table 9 summarizes our findings. The MSPE ratios in Table 9 indicate somewhat larger gains in forecasting accuracy from using oil futures prices than in Tables 4 through 8. There are a number of caveats, however. First, the h-month oil futures forecasts are not forecasts for a horizon of h months, as in Tables 4 through 8, but rather for a horizon that may vary arbitrarily between h and h+1 months. For example, an oil futures contract quoted on August 13 for delivery starting on October 1 would be considered a 1-month contract for the purpose of Table 9, but so would an oil-futures contract quoted on August 25 for delivery starting on October 1. This is an inherent limitation of working with daily oil futures price data. This concern suggests caution in interpreting short-horizon results, but obviously becomes less important as h increases. A second concern is that the sample period spanned by the daily data extends back to January 1986, whereas the data in Tables 4 through 8 start in 1990. This difference is not driving the results in Table 9. It can be shown that making the sample period compatible with that in the earlier Tables would yield substantively identical results., 343812=Table 17a: Recursive Forecast Error Diagnostics for the Real Price of Oil (by Country), Evaluation Period: 1991.12-2009.8 - U.S. Refiners' Acquisition Cost for Imported Crude Oil, 385149=37.\u00a0\u00a0 The threshold of $120 in this example follows from adjusting the cost estimates for shale oil production in Farrell and Brandt (2006) for the cumulative inflation rate since 2000.\u00a0Return to text, 143210=MSPE ratios are informative about relative forecasting accuracy, but are not informative about how accurate these models are in practice. Figure 11 focuses on the ability of recursively estimated AR(4) and VAR(4) models based on the real price of oil imports to predict the recessions of 1991, 2001, and 2007/8. The upper panel plots the one-quarter-ahead forecasts against the forecast realizations. AR and VAR forecasts are generally quite similar. Neither model is able to forecast the large economic declines in 1990/91, 2001, and 2008/09. The forecast accuracy deteriorates further at the one-year horizon, as shown in the lower panel., 197064=Third, we have deliberately refrained from exploring the use of factor models for forecasting the price of oil. In related work, Zagaglia (2010) reports some success in using a factor model in forecasting the nominal price of oil at short horizons, although his evaluation period is limited to early 2003 to early 2008, given the data limitations, and it is unclear how sensitive the results would be to extending the evaluation period. An obvious concern is that there are no price reversals over the evaluation period, so any predictor experiencing sustained growth is likely to have some forecasting power. Moreover, we have shown in section 5 that much simpler forecasting models appear capable of generating equally substantial reductions in the MSPE of the nominal price of oil at short horizons and do so for extended periods. The more important problem from an economic point of view, in any case, is forecasting the real price of oil. It seems unlikely that approximate factor models could be used to forecast the real price of oil. The variables that matter most for the determination of the real price of oil are global. Short of developing a comprehensive worldwide data set of real aggregates at monthly frequency, it is not clear whether there are enough predictors available for reliable real-time estimation of the factors. For example, drawing excessively on U.S. real aggregates as in Zagaglia (2010) is unlikely to be useful for forecasting the global price of oil for the reasons discussed in section 4. Using a cross-section of data on energy prices, quantities, and other oil-market related indicators may be more promising, but almost half of the series used by Zagaglia are specific to the United States and unlikely to be representative of global markets., 14324=Whereas the WTI price is a good proxy for the U.S. price for oil during 1948-72, when the U.S. was largely self-sufficient in oil, it becomes less representative after 1973, when the share of U.S. imports of oil rapidly expanded. The price discrepancy between unregulated foreign oil and regulated domestic oil created increasing pressure to deregulate the domestic market. As regulatory control weakened in the mid-1970s, adjustments to the WTI price became much more frequent and smaller in magnitude, as shown in the right panel of Figure 1. By the mid-1980s, the WTI had been deregulated to the point that there was strong comovement between all three oil price series most of the time., 51445=The most common approach to forecasting the nominal price of oil is to treat the price of the oil futures contract of maturity h as the h-period forecast of the price of oil.17 In particular, many central banks and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) use the price of NYMEX oil futures as a proxy for the market's expectation of the spot price of crude oil. A widespread view is that prices of NYMEX futures contracts are not only good proxies for the expected spot price of oil, but also better predictors of oil prices than econometric forecasts. Forecasts of the spot price of oil are used as inputs in the macroeconomic forecasting exercises that these institutions produce. For example, the European Central Bank (ECB) employs oil futures prices in constructing the inflation and output-gap forecasts that guide monetary policy (see Svensson 2005). Likewise the IMF relies on futures prices as a predictor of future spot prices (see, e.g., International Monetary Fund 2005, p. 67; 2007, p. 42). Futures-based forecasts of the price of oil also play a role in policy discussions at the Federal Reserve Board. This is not to say that forecasters do not recognize the potential limitations of futures-based forecasts of the price of oil. Nevertheless, the perception among many macroeconomists, financial analysts and policymakers is that oil futures prices, imperfect as they may be, are the best available forecasts of the spot price of oil. Such attitudes have persisted notwithstanding recent empirical evidence to the contrary and notwithstanding the development of theoretical models aimed at explaining the lack of predictive ability of oil futures prices and spreads (see, e.g., Knetsch 2007; Alquist and Kilian 2010)., 312701=Table 12: Recursive Forecast Error Diagnostics for the Real Price of Oil from Selected AR and ARMA Models U.S. Refiners' Acquisition Cost for Imported Crude Oil, Evaluation Period: 1991.12-2009.8, 22048=Even proponents of using the nominal price in empirical models of the transmission of oil price shocks have concluded that there is no stable dynamic relationship between percent changes in the nominal price of oil and in U.S. macroeconomic aggregates. There is evidence from in-sample fitting exercises, however, of a predictive relationship between suitable nonlinear transformations of the nominal price of oil and U.S. real output, in particular. The most successful of these transformations is the net oil price increase measure of Hamilton (1996, 2003). Let denote the nominal price of oil in logs and the difference operator. Then the net oil price increase is defined as:, 361117=NOTES: The benchmark model is an AR(4) for U.S. real GDP growth. The nonlinear dynamic models are described in the text. Boldface indicates gains in accuracy relative to benchmark model. The restricted model suppresses feedback from lagged percent changes in the price of oil to current real GDP growth, as proposed by Hamilton (2003, 2010). The restricted exogenous model combines this restriction with that of exogenous oil prices, further increasing the parsimony of the model., 215777=Elder, J., and A. Serletis (2010), \"Oil Price Uncertainty,\" Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 42, 1138-1159., 101899=There are no household surveys of oil price expectations, but, as discussed earlier, there are monthly data on the views of professional forecasters in the Consensus Economics forecast. Figure 7 highlights some systematic differences between these professional forecasts and the corresponding household gasoline price expectations. Whereas households' gasoline price forecast tends to exceed the current gasoline price by the expected inflation rate, professional oil price forecasts most of the time are below the current price of oil. The upper panel of Figure 7 shows that professional forecasters tend to smooth the predicted path relative to the current price. This smoothing is especially apparent during large oil price fluctuations such as those in 1990/91, in 1999/2000, and in 2003-2009. This tendency contributes to the large and persistently negative forecast errors shown in the lower panel of Figure 7 and helps explain why the consensus forecast does not significantly improve on the no-change forecast (see Table 11)., 377144=22.\u00a0\u00a0 The corresponding 5-year Michigan survey inflation expectations are only available back to mid-2004, making the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) data the best available proxy for 5-year inflation expectations (after suitable scaling). These data were obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Although the SPF data are quarterly, the data evolve so smoothly that assigning the same quarterly value to each month in that quarter is likely to provide a good approximation.\u00a0Return to text, 254782=NOTES: Risks are defined in terms of the event that the price of oil (in 2009.12 dollars) exceeds 80 dollars or falls below 45 dollars. For further discussion of these risk measures see Kilian and Manganelli (2007)., 221062=International Monetary Fund 2007. World Economic Outlook, Washington, DC., 98287=As Anderson et al. observe, a likely explanation of this pattern is that households form their expectations by adding long-term inflation expectations to the current price of gasoline. If we adjust the survey gasoline price forecast for the 10-year inflation forecast in the Survey of Professional Forecasters (suitably scaled to the 5-year horizon), the two series line up rather well on average, implying that households' expectations of gasoline prices closely resemble a random walk forecast for the real price of gasoline (see second panel of Figure 6).22 Only on rare occasions such as immediately before the peak of the nominal price of oil in mid-2008 and near the oil price trough of 2008/2009 do household expectations depart from the no-change forecast. In the first instance, households predicted an even higher price of oil; in the second instance, they did not expect the price of oil to drop as sharply as it did., 193283=It is immediately evident that the three standard volatility measures in Figure 15 are not good proxies for either of the two risks shown in Figure 16. For example, in the second half of 2008 volatility skyrockets while the upside risk plummets. The upside risk peaks in mid-2008, when the real price of oil peaked, but volatility only peaks in December 2008 or January 2009, when the real price of oil had reached a trough, much to the relief of oil consumers. Moreover, the spikes in volatility in 2001/02 and 2003 are not mirrored by increases in upside risk, while the sustained increase in upside risk after 2004 is not mirrored by a sustained increase in volatility. Nor is volatility systematically related to downside oil price risks. Although both downside risks and volatility peak in 2001/02, the sustained increase in volatility in early and mid-2008 is not mirrored by an increase in downside risk. Furthermore, the decline in downside risks during 2004 and 2005 is not reflected in systematic changes in volatility., 126915=In this section we illustrate how to generate such projections from the structural moving average representation of the VAR model of Kilian and Murphy (2010) estimated on data extending to 2009.8. The discussion closely follows Baumeister and Kilian (2011). This model allows the identification of three structural shocks: (1) a shock to the flow of the production of crude oil (\"flow supply shock), (2) a shock to the flow demand for crude oil and other industrial commodities (\"flow demand shock\") that reflects unexpected fluctuations in the global business cycle, and (3) a shock to the demand for oil inventories arising from forward-looking behavior (\"speculative demand shock\"). The structural demand and supply shocks in this model are mainly identified by a combination of sign restrictions and bounds on impact price elasticities. This model is set-identified, but the admissible models can be shown to be quite similar, allowing us to focus on one such model with little loss of generality. We focus on the same model that Kilian and Murphy use as the basis for their historical decompositions.}",
