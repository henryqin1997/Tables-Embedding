We know that to build a nuclear power station\u2014one of 1287 the massive ones\u2014will probably cost us up to \u00a31,000 million; certainly over \u00a3600 million. There again we have to pay for the energy we get. It is interesting to note that when one tries to do these things quickly they become far too expensive to be worth while. People sometimes talk about crash programmes. They say, \"Oh, don't worry. If things go wrong we can push through a crash programme\" My Lords, a crash programme is a disaster programme. It is one of the worst things in which one can possibly indulge, because more energy is used up in building the stations than is got out of them for many years. Let us suppose that we wanted to build in this country 100 nuclear stations. Thank heavens! we do not have to consider this, but let us suppose that we had to do so, and within a period of 10 years. It would ruin the country. It would be quite impossible. All the energy of the country would be used up in producing the energy stations. In other words, there is a certain rate, an economical rate, at which one can proceed, and one cannot go faster than that., 30908=My Lords, there is no problem so great that it cannot be ignored by those countries, those Governments, those Parliaments, those citizens, who choose to bury their heads in the sand. In the coal industry there is a grave conflict which has to be faced. May I venture to say that when I was a Member of another place I sat for a mining constituency. I knew all the collieries in my constituency. Although we might have had our differences politically, I never heard a harsh word from my constituents working in those dark, cavernous recesses of the earth. I am not anti-mining; I am pro-mining. I am not anti-miner; I am pro-miner., 40847=\"When this Government came to Office in February 1974 pensions stood at \u00a37.75 and \u00a312.50. I have decided that from this November the single pension will go up to \u00a317.50 and the married couples pension to \u00a328, cash increases of \u00a32.20 and \u00a33.50 over the present rates. This is an increase of nearly fourteen-and-a-half per cent.; and for married couples it equals the 1300 biggest cash rise ever\u2014the one we made shortly after returning to power in 1974. The increases will also apply to the standard rate of widows' pensions and to invalidity pensions., 1424=\u00a7 Lord WYNNE-JONES rose to call attention to the energy problems facing this country; and to move for Papers. The noble Lord said: My Lords, in introducing this subject to your Lordships' House, I think I should explain at the start that I speak on behalf of nobody except myself. I am not speaking on behalf of a particular Party or a Government, and although I am fortunate enough to be a Member of the Committee of your Lordships' House which deals with the subject of energy in relation to the European Communities, I think that the noble Earl, Lord Lauderdale, will deal with that part 1286 of the subject, and so I propose to roam rather widely over the whole range of this subject., 22364=No doubt new resources will be found or will be invented and, as the noble Lord, Lord Wynne-Jones, pointed out, of course, at a price. No doubt economic levels everywhere will, as they say, 1293 \"adjust\". But what does \"adjust\" mean? Since no political entity will plan for permanent dependence on uncontrollable outside supplies, we must expect the consolidation of some political blocs and the break-up of others. History is not empty of severe examples of primitive peoples overwhelming sophisticated civilisations and, within a century, reducing the vanquished population by half. One thinks of the Slav invasions of the Roman Empire and the Mongol invasions of China., 23263=My Lords, consider who, for us in Britain, are our energy neighbours. There is the European Community aiming at something like a half dependence on imported energy and, therefore, with their eyes sharply fixed on our own offshore. Across the Atlantic there is a gigantic American import demand. As for the Soviet Union, to which the noble Lord, Lord Wynne-Jones, has just drawn our attention, it appears that that country is heading to be an importer of energy, quite soon, by about 1985. Then, what about the teeming Third World of developing countries whose access to energy holds the key to their industrialisation, and therefore to the conquest of the explosive population pressures now pushing so urgently on their subsistence economy? I believe that only in Eurasia; that is to say, South-East Asia and the Middle East, is there abundance, and the question arises: On what terms is that abundance to be available to others? Energy may make more fortunes than prudence; but with energy at the base of an industrial society, and therefore with energy the touchstone of sovereignty and independence, we are forced to ask ourselves: Can an independent West, an independent European Community, survive even if it achieves independence of foreign supplies up to 50 per cent. by 1985?, 27502=1295 With regard to conservation, may I remind your Lordships that it is not only a question of switching off lights at home, double-glazing the windows or stopping draughts. In industry and the actual conversion of coal to electricity, there is an enormous wastage, up to something like 60 per cent. That is an area that clamours for research. A right policy will secure a suitable but, I take it, flexible balance between the claims of these three research areas. Finally, a right policy will provide the means of encouraging investment, not only public sector investment but private sector investment also, and will protect it\u2014may I add this in parenthesis\u2014without any kind of retrospective change of the ground rules where private enterprise investment is concerned., 72063=I welcome the confirmation that from November disabled married women who are unable to go out to work and to do housework will be eligible for the noncontributory invalidity pension. The increase in the mobility allowance from \u00a35 a week to \u00a37 a week, to which the Statement refers, is welcome, but I am afraid that it leaves the mobility allowance totally inadequate for its purpose. We shall watch very carefully to see whether the Government's forecast of the rate of inflation is proved correct. Should the rate prove to be higher, we shall press for an interim review., 15715=\u00a7 Many of your Lordships will have heard of the book which has just come out, published by one of these bodies which always operates under a series of initials. It is called the Workshop on Alternative Energy Strategies, which is at MIT, and the book is called The Global Prospects of Energy. There it states that there are four essentials for an American energy policy. First of all, it says: Remember that the supply of oil will cease to meet existing demands before the year 2000; second, that the demand for energy will continue to increase despite Governmental conservation policies; thirdly, that energy reserves must be developed with the utmost vigour. Then we come to the final point: The interdependence of nations in the energy field requires an unprecedented degree of international collaboration in the future. In addition, it requires the will to mobilise finance, labour, research and ingenuity with a common purpose never before attained in times of peace. And it requires it now. We are getting there a real call for urgency; and I would submit that it is playing with 1291 this issue if we do not face these real problems and if we airily dismiss them by saying, \"Oh, something will turn up\". What will turn up will be a very chilly, frigid future. We can be sure that it is only by international effort in which we all play our part that we have a hope of meeting this world problem of energy. My Lords, I beg to move for Papers., 9966=\u00a7 What, then, my Lords, are really the options which lie before us? Primarily, I believe that there are three options. First, there is conservation. Without any doubt at all, the most important thing to do is to conserve energy, because every time you waste energy you are in effect trying to develop a new means of getting energy to correspond to what you have wasted. Therefore, we must conserve; and the possibilities of conservation are considerable, although there again one has to remember that they are not always cheap. For example, the insulation of houses ought to be carried out on an extensive scale. It is much more expensive to insulate old houses than new ones. When you are talking about building a new house, you can include the whole plan of insulation in it, but when you are talking about the millions of old houses in the country it is a much more 1289 difficult and expensive matter. Nevertheless, it should be done; and the waste from factories is probably even worse. One has, therefore, a very considerable scope for conservation. If one thinks of what it is now fashionable to call a scenario for the future, I would say that up to the year 2000 or so we ought to think that any additional energy that we need will come, to the extent of about a quarter, from conservation, I hope. I do not mean that we can save by one quarter over our whole field, but one quarter of the additional amount that we would require in that period., 80843=My Lords, in some respects I take the noble Lord's point and accept what he says. I am trying to say that next April we are embarking on an entirely new system, because of those who are going to contract out and because we are introducing a wholly earnings-related policy. This has made it very difficult. There is nothing sinister in not telling your Lordships; at this present stage we just do not know., 66011=My Lords, I must first thank the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, for repeating the Statement. But I must say that at the heart of the Statement lies a contradiction, because Section 125 of the Social Security Act 1975, the section to which the Statement refers, charges the Secretary of State with the task of ensuring that pensions and other benefits retain their value. I shall not read out Section 125, but it is quite specific on this point, and so is the Statement, because the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, said\u2014and I quote the Statement\u2014 \u2026 so the increase in prices will be the benchmark both for long and for short-term benefits\". This is an essential point here. But we have a contradiction, because the noble Lord's right honourable friend the Secretary of State assured another place that he expected the rate of inflation to fall during the next six months., 43082=\"I now turn to the civilian disabled. The therapeutic earnings limit, which is applicable to all the incapacity benefits, will go up from \u00a39 to \u00a310 a week. I am glad to confirm that, from the week beginning 14th November, disabled married women unable to go out to work and unable to do their housework will be eligible for the noncontributory invalidity pension. There will be a more detailed announcement on this later., 39351=\"In accordance with Section 125 of the Social Security Act 1975 I reviewed the present level of benefits before the end of the 1976\u201377 financial year, and formally determined that they needed to he increased. Increases will be paid from the week beginning 14th November, which is one year after the last uprating., 68213=I turn to certain matters which we welcome. We welcome the fact that the Statement assures us that the disabled married woman who is unable to go out 1310 to work and to do housework will be eligible for the non-contributory invalidity pension. We are assured that a more detailed announcement will be made about this later on, and I am not in a position to comment further at the present moment., 40109=\"In the Financial Statement published at the time of my right honourable friend the Chancellor's Budget, prices were forecast to rise by 13 per cent. between the last quarter of 1976 and the last quarter of this year. Having given full consideration to all relevant matters, I am satisfied that this forecast represents the most reliable guide available to me of the likely movement of prices between last November and this November. I expect the rate of inflation to fall during the next six months well below the year-on-year rate represented by the April monthly figure which was published last week. The factors that gave rise to that rate were foreseen and fully taken into account in the forecast I have mentioned., 81804=My Lords, those of us who have listened to this Statement from this side of the House welcome it. I hate to introduce any acerbity into this debate or to carp about it politically, but I must point out the illogicality of all that we have heard. In the first place, we are told that this is not enough and then, secondly, we are asked who is to pay for it. We have already been told that the contributions will be \u00a31,250,000, so I ask the categorical question: would the Opposition, had they the power at the present moment, do nothing? Or, would they give more than we have given and, if they gave more, would they not have to increase the contribution for National Insurance? Why not greet this welcome help to the underprivileged in our society and face the realities of the economic position? We 1314 know it is difficult; it would be difficult for the Opposition were they in power and it is difficult for us. For heaven's sake stop carping and help Britain to get out of its difficulties!, 21617=The very short point about the Energy Council meeting on 14th June is the stark fact, to which the noble Lord has already referred, that the industrial West threatens to run short of oil and gas energy well before the end of the century, that nuclear energy development has proved to be a disappointment and is going slowly, that the possibilities of hydro are limited and that coal output is at best stagnant. Other sources must therefore be found in the next 15 to 20 years and, even supposing that they are found, the transition from a civilisation dependent on coal, oil and gas to these other sources will require political management of a far higher order than the world has seen since the OPEC countries took up their position., 75294=All I can say is that it is the considereo view of the Government, rightly or wrongly\u2014time will tell, and I am sure noble Lords opposite will not hesitate to remind us if we are wrong\u2014that the amount by which we uprate pensions, starting from next November, will materially increase the real value of pensions. This is because the Government believe that inflation will fall; but, as I say, time will tell. The only other point that was raised was child benefit. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Sandys, knows, this is a matter not for the present but for the future and one which my right honourable friend and his Ministers are considering., 35599=Secondly, to come back to United Kingdom policy, why should there be 1298 any serious resistance to miners retiring at 60? Why resist miners retiring at 50, or 40, or 35? Why not be quite frank and set out to buy them out, in the way the dockers have been bought out, and exclude from the coal-face anyone who has not got a B.Sc. and is probably under the age of 35? It is not that we need a great many more miners. What we do need is the application of the mining force we have got to the best available equipment which, however, I shall not detain your Lordships now by trying to describe., 88813=My Lords, if your Lordships want me to take up the time of the House I can say that in December 1976 the Government actuaries estimated, on certain assumptions about unemployment levels and earnings movements, that the Fund would show an operating surplus of something like \u00a3888 million in 1977\u201378. The effect of the uprating alone will be to reduce the expected surplus to about \u00a3680 million. But a further report of the Government actuary will be available when the uprating order is laid, and I am afraid I cannot be of any greater help than that to the noble Viscount., 39727=\"Under the Act pensions and other long-term benefits must go up in line with the rise in earnings or prices, whichever is greater, and short-term benefits must rise in line with prices. During the 12 months to November 1977 prices are expected to rise faster than earnings, so the increase in prices will be the benchmark both for long and for short-term benefits., 77847=My Lords, I think that it is right, in the sense that there is an obligation, which each Government, since time immemorial, have accepted, to do something for those in the community who are less fortunately placed. In different ways, this has been part of the philosophy of both sides of your Lordships' House. The uprating is to take place in November, and the contributions start in April of each year. The Government are going to review the question of contributions this coming autumn, but they are working to a very tight schedule. The review will take a considerable time, because we have to think out new contributions in relation both to those who will be contributing towards a wholly earnings-related policy and to those who will be in a contracted-out scheme. Certainly I cannot today 1313 give your Lordships any indication of what the increase is likely to be in April next., 32005=I want to ask the Government whether they are satisfied that the National Coal Board's Plan for Coal is anything like enough. It is grandiose indeed, but is it anything like grand enough? I want to ask whether the Coal Board are shouting at the pitheads that new methods to enable one man to do the work of 40 do not mean 39 redundancies but 40 times the 1297 output. That is the message which surely has to be megaphoned up and down the country. Forty times the output would give Britain a new voice in the EEC and the EEC a new voice in the world. By the same token, in the Community, are we pressing for a target of coal production merely to maintain things as they are or to go further and achieve many times better?, 84464=My Lords, there will be no Election in November., 44331=\"Also in November, the Supplementary Benefits Commission will increase the discretionary additions for extra heating from 70p to 80p from \u00a31.40 to \u00a31.60, and from \u00a32.10 to \u00a32.40. The discretionary addition for special dietary needs will go up from 75p to 90p, and from \u00a31.75 to \u00a32.10., 24559=My Lords, could the European Community have an energy policy? I believe that so long as the main members of it pull apart, so long as their attitude to the Community is what they call in Brussels a menu \u00e0 la carte\u2014you work together when you are in trouble, and only then\u2014so long as it fails to command the loyalty of the common citizen there will be no common industrial objective; there will be no common industrial policy and therefore there will be no hope of a common 1294 energy policy which could prove to be the touchstone of its survival as a political entity., 7793=\u00a7 With regard to other sources, we can talk about coal. We are fortunate in having considerable reserves of coal; but, unlike America, those reserves are very difficult to win. In America they are 1288 fortunate because, especially in the West of America, they have vast reserves of coal which are within a few hundred feet of the surface and which can be won by strip-mining. These reserves, they reckon, amount to probably 200 or 300 years' reserves of coal; and, because they are occurring in enormous seams up to 60 ft. deep, they are extremely cheap to get. Therefore, they can get the coal easily: we can get it, but at a cost. In Europe, except in Germany, they have reached a point where they cannot get much coal, and therefore they are in a worse position., 87803=My Lords, I should like to ask one supplementary question. Am I to understand from what the noble Lord has said that the whole cost of the increase between November and April, when higher contributions may take effect. will fall on the taxpayer?, 28932=All these are possibilities; but surely these exciting possibilities have blinded us to a major policy decision which is staring us in the face. I come back to coal. Not only has coal been described as a portable climate, but there is any amount of it. As I daresay we may hear later and more authoritatively from my noble friend Lord Bessborough, as rapporteur of the Committee of Technology in the European Parliament, they there and others here have discerned that there are now resources of coal available, albeit at a price, to a far greater extent than was imagined 10 years ago. Thanks to the new developments in seismic surveying, which has been largely prompted by the oil industry, it is now possible to survey this country; and the National Coal Board have a rolling programme of exploration looking for new sources. Think how that contrasts with the day of the unfortunate noble Lord, Lord Robens, who was appointed to chair the NCB to close collieries down! Then the idea was: we do not want more: we want less. 1296 Now there is a programme for discovering more, and they have found any amount. We believe there is still much more to be found., 43533=\"The House will also recall that I have already announced an increase of \u00a32 in the mobility allowance with effect 1301 from November. For supplementary benefit, the cash increases in the main scale rates will be the same as those in the related National Insurance benefits, and they will come into force at the same time. For the present at least, there will continue to be five separate children's supplementary benefit rates, related to age; the proposal we have had under consideration to reduce the number of these rates will be studied further as part of the review of the supplementary benefits scheme., 41617=By November we will have far more than doubled pensions compared with the rates paid by the previous Government. Even after allowing for inflation, by last November this Government had increased the real value of pensions and other benefits by 15 per cent. This November's increase should cover inflation since the last uprating and provide a further increase in real purchasing power., 74524=To turn to the matter of inflation, I tried to point out that the uprating benefit is related to inflation from last November to this November and not from last April to this April. Secondly, the April-on-April figure is no guide to the inflation we can expect in the second half of the year. It included the price rises due to the Budget; namely, cigarettes, petrol, vehicle excise duty and increases in rates. These are the main items responsible for the increase in prices and, 1312 therefore, in inflation. Thirdly, the April year-on-year figure is not out of line with our expectations., 71064=There is no point in applauding particular figures for particular benefits unless one knows the answer to that question, and it depends upon one's opinion of that answer. However, the uprating should not be regarded as a distribution of Government largesse. Increases due to inflation 1311 should be covered, or nearly covered, by earnings-related contributions without any increase in the percentage contribution rate. We know that earnings-related contributions have been producing surpluses. The Statement says that this uprating will cost the National Insurance Fund \u00a31,250 million extra this year; but that is as against a figure of \u00a31,158 million extra for the uprating last year. Therefore, allowing for the decline in the value of money, this year's extra cost would appear to be less, in real terms., 83526=My Lords, would the noble Lord perhaps realise that suspicious minds might think that giving this agreeable news, which we all welcome, at this time and postponing until November the announcement of the cost of it so far as the working population is concerned, might place the Government at some advantage from an electoral point of view if a General Election took place in October?, 19628=Some of us particularly urged that there should be such a debate at this time because on 14th June the Energy Ministers of the European Community will be meeting in Brussels to discuss the alarming situation and to examine it in the light of three documents recently published by the European Commission. Two are on energy use to date; and those two include one with a Jeremiah-type warning that 1292 performance in reducing the West's dependence on imported energy has been nothing like satisfactory. The second is a further Jeremiad on the state of the coal industry, to which the noble Lord, Lord Wynne-Jones, referred with such emphasis. The Commission most solemnly warn: There is a progressive deterioration in the coal industry and in many cases receipts no longer cover costs despite subsidy\". That warning is borne out by figures made available by the Department of Energy here showing that Britain's coal output actually fell nearly 7 per cent. over the period 1973 to 1976., 70186=My Lords, I, too, should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Wells-Pestell, for repeating the Statement made in another place. The Statement says that this uprating should cover inflation since the last uprating and provide a further increase in real purchasing power. This is assuming that the increase in prices from last November to next November is 13 per cent., in which case an increase of 14\u00bd per cent. would allow 1\u00bd per cent. for an increase in real value. However, it seems to me that this is an optimistic assumption to make, in view of the fact, as the noble Lord, Lord Sandys, has already said, that the most recent figure we have is of an inflation rate of 17\u00bd per cent. I very much doubt whether the increase will cover inflation, let alone provide for an increase in real value. That is the crux of the matter., 79463=My Lords, could not the Government at least have given an indication of what is the meaning, in terms of contribution, of the increases that have been given? I am sure that the noble Lord is aware that nobody wants to crab him in any way for announcing increases in benefits. Having had to announce them in the past, I know how very satisfying it is. However, the fact is that then the increases in contributions were announced at the same time. May I suggest to the Government that it is only right that they should announce what is the cost to the working community\u2014and to industry, of course\u2014of the increases? It is only right that we should see what these increases are costing the nation. There is no question of one side crabbing the other. It is just a matter of proper accountancy.}",
