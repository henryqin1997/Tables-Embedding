It was imported in the late 1970s to late 1980s (its importation banned in 1989 by the infamous ATF re-interpretation of the \"Sporting Clause\" of GCA-68. In May 1989 the ATF determined that the imported 'assault weapons' were not suitable for sporting purposes as put forth by the older GCA 68.), however many more HK94s were imported into the country than factory original MP5s during that time period. In the early 1980s, it was cheaper to convert the plentiful and less expensive semiauto gun and register it as a Title II weapon. A large portion of the full auto MP5s coming into the country were slated for Law Enforcement and Military sales., 269746=Shortened MP5A2 with added foregrip, that has been developed in hardly more than few pieces in 1976., 296458=German Sport Guns began importing the GSG5 Sporting Carbine into the U.S. in 2007. It is not a Heckler & Koch firearm, but is a .22 LR clone of the MP5. What makes it unique is that many parts are interchangeable with Airsoft MP5 parts, so many gun enthusiasts are putting on telescoping stocks, fake suppressors, tactical flash lights fore ends and rails on these .22 Carbines and pistols., 271732=The SP89 is a semiautomatic version of the MP5K and was imported for a short while in 1989 but was banned from importation by 1990.}",
