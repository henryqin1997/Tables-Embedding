In addition to the SB-66\u2019s new facelift, the visually stunning lines and sculpted tubeset of the SB-66 will certainly capture your attention like love-at-first-sight. Of course, the SB-66 wouldn't be the SB-66 without its mind, body and soul: Switch Technology. Switch Technology is a modified dual-link system that utilizes an eccentric mechanism that switches direction as the bike moves through travel to control pedaling forces and wheel path, resulting in both efficient climbing and descending. With Switch Technology gracing your machine, the suspension is quite active on downhills, yet completely efficient for trekking up steep switchbacks.}",
