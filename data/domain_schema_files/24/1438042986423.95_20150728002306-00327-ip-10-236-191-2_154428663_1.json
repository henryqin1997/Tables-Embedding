Lupul has already stated he won\u2019t rush himself back because of Toronto\u2019s recent success, Gunnarsson has been banged up and could use a game off or two, and that leaves the main guy who needs to be ready for the Playoffs, James Reimer.

James Reimer is Very Good Goalie (Blue Chip Prospects) I don\u2019t see how you could argue otherwise. Reimer Continues Solid Response to Deadline Frenzy (TSN) Jonas Siegel seems to agree with Curt.
