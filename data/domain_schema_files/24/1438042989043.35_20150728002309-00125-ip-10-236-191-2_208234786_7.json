There are three kinds of Dragon Orders: Copper Dragon Orders, Silver Dragon Orders, and Gold Dragon Orders. The higher the level at which you accept the quest, the more EXP & SP you are rewarded upon completion and the better odds you have at a more valuable Dragon Order. The rewards are as follows: Rewards 6 Dragon Order Value 5 Dragon Quest Items 4 Bosses 3 Sequence of Missions 2 Quest Names 1 Rewards Contents Dragon Quests are quests you can start taking at level 20 after completing the \"Love of Dragon\" quest, and every 10 levels (starting at level 31) adds a new Dragon Quest (or \"DQ\" for short), with better odds at better rewards, up to level 91. The rewards, called Dragon Orders, are given after completing the tenth part of each Dragon Quest. Once a Dragon Quest is completed, it can be started again immediately. searchnavigation ,",

To get the molds or other items you usually need many of these Dragon Orders (e.g., 50 copper and 30 silver). The molds are used for crafting legendary armor (levels 40, 60, & 80), legendary weapons (level 50), and legendary ornaments (levels 31, 86, & 87). These items are extremely powerful for their level, thus are quite valuable. They are made from the Legendary Forges near General Summer in Southwest Archosaur, and require more materials than usual, including the blood items you get from doing FBs.
