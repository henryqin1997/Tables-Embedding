SHRP-P-633 and SHRP-P-634, SHRP, National Research Council, January 1991., 70518=For sections within SMP, subsurface temperatures can be extracted from the SMP_MRCTEMP_* tables. However, temperature gradients in the pavement surface layer are also manually collected during FWD testing for both SMP and non-SMP test sections. These pavement temperature readings were taken at regular 30- to 60-minute intervals during deflection testing at each LTPP site and are stored within the MON_DEFL_TEMPS_DEPTHS and MON_DEFL_TEMPS_VALUES tables. We will have to extract the temperatures, depths, and times into a single table and the deflection values, deflection test locations, and times into another table. An interpolation process must then be used to estimate the temperature gradient present within the AC pavement layers at the time of the actual deflection test. Assuming that we want data from site 341003 for a test conducted on 3/11/99, the required SQL statement is:, 162586=Materials Sampling and Field Testing Plan, Louisiana SPS-7 Project 2207, IH-10 Eastbound, Ascension Parish, Louisiana, FHWA, Pavement Performance Division, May 1991., 154462=Construction Report on LTPP 51A300, SPS-3 Project, Petersburg, Virginia, FHWA, Pavement Performance Division, 1990., 136011=Construction Report on Site 320100, Interstate Highway No. I-80, Humboldt and Lander Counties, Nevada, Final Report, FHWA, Pavement Performance Division, March 1998., 34092=Because we did not specify a CONSTRUCTION_NO, we received two sets of layer information. The differences are attributable to a mill and AC overlay operation that occurred in 1994. (The type of operation can be determined by querying CN_CHANGE_REASON in the EXPERIMENT_SECTION table.) The thickness of layer 5 was reduced to 0, layer 4 was reduced in thickness, and layer 6 was added to the cross section of this site at that time.

The drop load is in kilonewtons and the peak deflection is in micrometers. For this information to be of any use in backcalculation, we must also determine the offsets of the deflection sensors. To do this, we must first determine the CONFIGURATION_NO from the MON_DEFL_LOC_INFO table and then query the MON_DEFL_DEV_SENSORS table using this value as follows:, 144808=SPS-1 Project 3501, Strategic Study of Structural Factors for Flexible Pavements, IH-25 Northbound, Dona Ana County, New Mexico, Final Report, FHWA, Pavement Performance Division, April 1996., 184311=Specific Pavement Studies , Experimental Design and Research Plan for Experiment SPS-2 , Strategic Study of Structural Factors for Rigid Pavements, SHRP, National Research Council, April 1990., 192434=SHRP-LTPP Overview: Five-Year Report, Publication No. SHRP-P-416, SHRP, National Research Council, June 1994., 128012=LTPP Seasonal Monitoring Program, Site Installation Report for GPS Section 271028 (27B), Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, FHWA, Pavement Performance Division, January 1996., 157890=Materials Sampling, Field Testing, and Laboratory Testing Plan, Strategic Highway Research Program, SPS-8 Experimental Project (Flexible and Rigid), Federal Aid Project No. ACNH-P099(370)Y, Sycamore Street, Delhi, Merced County, California, FHWA, Pavement Performance Division, February 1999., 137534=Construction Report on Site 060600, Interstate Highway No. I-5, Mt.
