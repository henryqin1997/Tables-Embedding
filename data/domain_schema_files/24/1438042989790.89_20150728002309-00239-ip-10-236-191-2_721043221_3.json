For example (see chart below). If your shoe size is a 7, and your width measurement is 9\u0094 your true shoe size is 7E Then follow the number to the right until you find your width fitting (or the nearest to it) in inches that you have just taken. Using the fitting chart below, find your shoe size up the left hand column. To take your true shoe fitting follow these simple steps: Your true size fitting Firstly you will need a measuring tape. Then to measure the width of your foot stand on the tape measure and wrap it around the widest part of the foot, as shown in the diagram. If one foot is wider than the other, then you should take the widest measurement. Step 1: Find your true shoe width It's an amazing fact, but one in three women in the US don't know their true shoe size. We all know our shoe or boot length, ie size 6, but there are two other important measurements to achieve a perfect fit. For shoes and boots you need your foot width, and for boots you also need your calf width. Follow these two simple steps to find out both, and discomfort caused by badly fitting footwear will become a thing of the past. Take two steps to better",
