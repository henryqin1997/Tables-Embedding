    "textBeforeTable": "SALMON RIVER - STEELHEAD CREEL NUMBERS\u00a0\u00a0 Week 2/24/13 Boat ramps between Salmon and Red Rock are now open, but ramps between Red Rock and Deadwater are still ice affected. In section 18, the boat ramps at Watts Bridge and Cottonwood campground are closed because of ice as well.\u00a0 Also, as of Sunday (24th), the ice jam was approximately one mile upstream of North Fork, and it is receding. - Brent Beller, Idaho Fish & Game Fisheries Technician, Salmon Region Section 16 had the best catch rate of the weekend at 5 hours per steelhead caught, and section 17 had the second best catch rate at 9 hours per steelhead caught. The rest of the river sections (14, 15, 18, and 19) had catch rates equal to, or above, 20 hours per steelhead caught. Fishing downstream of Deadwater was hindered by poor water visibility which most likely factored into the poor catch rates observed in sections 14 and 15. Very few anglers were found fishing upstream of Ellis in section 18, and no anglers were found in section 19 during the weekend. Angler effort on the upper Salmon River this past weekend was fairly similar to the previous weekend, but the catch rates were much more inconsistent between the river section. Submitted by",
