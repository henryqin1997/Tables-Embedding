Comparison Table - Synthetic Fill Sleeping Bags It is important to store your sleeping bag as loosely as possible as excessive compression damages the fibres of both down and synthetic bags. Many sleeping bags, usually down bags, come with a breathable cotton storage sack, but you can always store them in a pillowcase or leave them loose in the airing cupboard. Synthetic bags are easier to wash in a large washing machine than down, we recommend tumble drying all sleeping bags to ensure that the bag dries evenly throughout. Whilst down bags can be washed at home with Nikwax products they may benefit from professional cleaning whenever possible. Care Other ways to stay warm include making sure you\u2019re warm before you get into your bag by exercising or eating, as it is much easier to retain warmth than to generate it. Try wearing a hat, but make sure you don\u2019t wear too many bulky clothes as this will compress the insulation making it less effective - good base layers are ideal. The use of sleeping bag accessories such as liners and mats are great ways to keep warm. Sleeping bag liners add an extra boost of warmth to your existing bag, and are much more comfortable than the nylon inner fabric of the sleeping bag. A liner also prevents you from having to wash your whole bag - just wash",
