This is here to show the relationship between current W3C recommendations and the definition of rich multimedia content: 1.2 Definition of Rich Multimedia Content. Content adaptation, such as when a portal delivers a mixed document with varying capabilities (textual content and interactive animated content, for example) to a user which has been aggregated from multiple rich content sources. Interaction with mixed content, for example interacting with all the parts (graphics, text, images, audio, video, voice and multimodal interaction) of the mixed document. Dynamic content: documents that are generated on the fly or which change over time Rich content for different contexts. Skinnable user interface: the ability to use animations and interactivity as a user interface \"skin\" or template around other content. Presentation can be customized to reflect a brand or user's personality. Portable user interface. Graphical menu systems where items have an animated action when focused on. Navigation (forward/backwards tab, up/down/left/right, accesskey, pointer, voice), graphical menus, interactivity and animations. Layout adaptation: layout can be based upon device characteristics - screen size, color depth, resolution, orientation. Content author/provider has exact control of the presentation, including fonts, layout, color, etc. Graphically rich content, possibly including animated background image. This specification",
    "textAfterTable": "1.3 Relationships With Other Technologies There are many technologies that allow combining different languages. Most extensible languages provide this feature. The combining technologies and issues can be divided in two categories. The first category is how the combining is described. The second category is how the semantics of combining is understood. Each language specifies the first category. The combining recommendations try to solve the second ones. 1.3.1 HTML and XHTML HTML has an <object> element. This element can be used to combine by reference. The <object> element provides a way to link to external documents. 1.3.2 SVG SVG has a <foreignObject> element. This element can be used to combine by reference. The <foreignObject> element provides a way to link to external documents. 1.3.3 SMIL SMIL technologies are closely related to combining by reference. SMIL provides mechanisms (e.g., <animation>, <audio> and <video> elements) to combine content and synchronize them in time. 1.3.4 XLink Xlink specifies a generic reusable vocabulary for links in XML documents. An XLink may be specified on an arbitrary element in such a way that an XLink enabled processor will be able to understand the linking semantics of said element. A variety of linking behaviors (embedding, hyperlinking, etc.) may be further described using additional linking metadata. 1.3.5 XInclude XInclude specifies how to combine different infosets together.
