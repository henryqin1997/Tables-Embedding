Josh Beckett (5.77 ERA, .401 SNWP) and Matsuzaka (4.72, .476 SNWP) have both missed time due to injuries, combining for just 44 starts; Sunday night's turn marked the latter's first quality start since August 5. What's particularly disconcerting about the trio's performances is that they're under contract for a collective $149 million, with Matsuzaka's pact running through 2012 and the other two through 2014. And you thought the Burnett contract looked bad., 37090=2008, 47344=From June 1-August 20, when he went to the DL, Rodriguez hit a hacktastic .242/.298/.479 with 14 homers in 265 plate appearances. He was a mess, with an unintentional walk rate (7.5 percent) well below his career mark (10.1 percent), and a .237 BABIP, due to a minimal line drive rate (10.5 percent according to the data at Fangraphs). Lefties particularly bedeviled him (.130/.215/.261 in 79 PA) during that stretch, and in fact he\u2019s still headed towards an uncharacteristically Grandersonesque showing against southpaws this year (.213/.315/.426 in 165 PA, with a .211 BABIP) after punishing them about as frequently as he has righties over the course of his career. Whether the reasons are physical (he's been dogged by a litany of leg problems all year) or mental (he's Alex Rodriguez, after all, and the wait for his 600th homer was interminable) isn't clear. But he\u2019s suddenly looking like the guy in the catalog again, the one making $32 million this year, at a time when the Yankees need him most., 46308=June, 21742=Forget Derek Jeter's decline, or the nagging injuries to Nick Swisher and Gardner. Nothing threatens the Bronx Bombers' chances of repeating as world champions the way their rotation woes do. Between the All-Star break and Sunday night, Yankees starters had put up a 5.15 ERA while averaging 5.7 innings per start, well off their first-half clip of a 3.68 ERA and 6.3 innings per start. Take away Sabathia, and the second-half numbers get even uglier: 5.73 ERA, 5.3 innings per start. Andy Pettitte, the only other Yankees starter with a Support Neutral Winning Percentage above .500, has made just two starts since leaving his July 18 outing with a groin strain, one good, the other lousy, and he maxed out at 79 pitches. Neither Vazquez (5.07 ERA, .440 SNWP) nor A.J. Burnett (5.05 ERA, .461 SNWP) are pitching at all like guys earning eight-figure deals, though at least the latter's September (4.26 ERA, 8.7 K/9) offers a glimmer of hope. Going into Sunday night's surprise start, Hughes had given the Yankees one quality start out of his last five, and a 5.27 ERA and 1.9 HR/9 in 94 innings since the team first skipped his turn in an effort to manage his innings total back in mid-June. On Saturday against the Red Sox, the Ivan Nova post-season start bandwagon went over a cliff when the 23-year-old rookie failed to get out of the fifth inning for the third time in five starts, helping to send the Yankees to their fourth straight defeat and a 6-13 record for the month., 36718=2007, 41719=1392, 37834=2010, 33528=Ortiz played a big part in Boston's first two wins over New York over the weekend, going 4-for-9 with a walk, a double, two runs and two RBI. Back in May, I wrote\u00a0of the Sox DH's inflated strikeout rate (34.9 percent at the time), and his flagging production overall. He came into Sunday night with 31 homers and a .301 True Average, both his highest marks since 2007, but his strikeout rate, while lower than it was in May, is still the highest of his career:, 46562=July, 35231=2003, 37462=2009, 35974=2005, 45799=April, 44635=I pointed this out at Pinstriped Bible\u00a0prior to Saturday's contest, and since then Rodriguez has added two more home runs to his total. Since returning to the lineup on September 6 following a stint on the disabled list for a calf strain, he's enjoyed not only his best month but his first good one since May:, 18969=Bless Joe Sheehan for reminding me that I'd written this piece\u00a0a year ago. With the help of Eric Seidman, I examined the September/October performances of all the playoff teams in the wild card era, 112 in all. For each team, we recorded their record over the final seven, 14, and 21 games, as well for all of September and whatever fragment of October remained. The result was, as I termed it then, \"a whole lot of nothing.\" None of the correlations between September interval performance and first-round series outcomes even reached .05 in either direction, and six of the eight were actually negative., 26107=Back in spring training, one of the key factors in Hughes beating out Chamberlain for the fifth starter job was the progress of his changeup, but the pitch may as well have spent the summer in the Federal Witness Protection Program. From the beginning of the season through his September 5 start, Hughes threw the changeup just 2.0 percent of the time according to the PITCHf/x data at TexasLeaguers.com. In his three starts since then, he's thrown it 8.4 percent of the time, almost exclusively against lefties. While batters take it more often than not, the changing speeds seems to help; lefties are just 7-for-47 (.149/.259/.340) against him in that span, compared to .249/.320/.431 prior, and Hughes has managed two quality starts out of three., 46817=August, 8299=September 27, 2010, 27134=David Price has begun living up to the promise that pushed him to the No. 2 spot on our 2009 Top 100 Prospects\u00a0list, and rookie Wade Davis has put up a 3.26 ERA in the second half while showing no ill effects from an August disabled list stint due to shoulder woes. The rest of the starting five is cause for great concern, however. Matt Garza has an 8.24 ERA, 3.2 HR/9, and 0.8 K/BB ratio this month after three consecutive disaster starts at the hands of the Red Sox and Yankees. Jeff Niemann, who went on the disabled list at the same time as Davis in August, has a 14.43 ERA, 7.0 BB/9 and 2.8 HR/9 over five starts since returning, while averaging less than four innings per turn. James Shields has been anything but Big Game James; he's got a 5.04 ERA and .429 SNWP while leading the majors in home runs allowed (34); he cost himself Sunday's game when he surrendered a three-run homer to Josh Freakin' Wilson, just his second homer of the year in 361 plate appearances. Rookie Jeremy Hellickson, who sparkled in his first four starts and who will have one of these men's jobs next year, is pitching out of the bullpen right now because he's up against his own innings cap. There's always the possibility the Rays could pull an October surprise and give him a post-season start, but nobody's banking upon it., 46054=May, 18669=While there are reasons to be concerned about the specific circumstances of any playoff-bound team's late-season struggles\u2014particularly with regards to injury availability\u2014there's virtually no correlation between a team's September performance and their playoff fate., 36346=2006, 19826=Looking beyond the first round, the correlations between those September performances and series won or \"playoff success points\" (doubling the value of the LCS and quadrupling the value of the World Series such that the same number of points were awarded each round) only got as high as .137, and they were negative at that. If anything, there's an ever-so slight inverse relationship between success in the final weeks and in the postseason, perhaps because some playoff-bound teams rest their regulars more often, or simply regress to the mean after a summer of beating up on opponents., 47073=September, 35602=2004, 43452=1616}",
