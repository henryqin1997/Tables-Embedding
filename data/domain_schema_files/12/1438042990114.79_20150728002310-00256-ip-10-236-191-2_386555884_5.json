Races: Any race can become a Necromaster but Vithui are the most common as they have a strong link to Negative energy. Abilities: The highest score of a Necromaster should be intelligence as their spellcasting requires it. Following that should be charisma as it determines the power of several of your abilities and at later stages is crucial for your health. Necromasters are generally very fragile spellcasters seldom getting close enough for melee. Instead they manipulate their minions into attacking in their name. They also act as a minor form of support, either strengthening your allies or weakening the opponents. Making a Necromaster[edit] Some mages specialize in blasting or shapeshifting. Some others specialize in the control and creation of Deathless or Undead beings. A Necromaster takes this further and devote all their magical skill to the art of Necromancy. Strangely in the art of necromancy there are two methods of its use, Positive and Negative.
