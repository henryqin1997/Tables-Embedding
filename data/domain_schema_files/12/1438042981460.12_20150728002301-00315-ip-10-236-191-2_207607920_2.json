Prior to Sept. 2004, however, only triggered data was archived for all high sample rate channels. \\epsfig{file=nhfn07_lcl.eps, width=8cm}\\end{center}\\end{figure}\" /> Geophone Calibration Tests: Comparisons of the inferred ground accelerations generated by local earthquakes from co-sited NHFN geophone and accelerometer pairs show that the waveforms generally are quite coherent in frequency and phase response, but that their inferred ground accelerations differ significantly. At times, the amplitudes differ by up to a factor of 2 while the times of the peak amplitudes are identical. This implies that",
