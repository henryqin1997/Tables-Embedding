Its scores on the Home, Creative, Work and the Adobe apps scenarios were noticeably below average. It did pick itself up on the Storage scenario, thanks to its quick SSD. However the key distinction here is that the compared notebooks all have far better processor and memory components that clearly make up for the gulf in benchmark scores. Had Microsoft supplied us with speedier variants, it should easily match up to the compared Ultrabooks the carried high-end configurations. Unfortunately at this point of time, test units are limited and all efforts are going into stocking up adequate inventory for its imminent launch. As such, our sub S$1,400 specced unit can't quite match up with most of the others that are priced around S$2,000. \u00a0 3DMark 2013 The Surface Pro 3\u2019s performance on 3DMark 2013 was not encouraging either as it recorded the lowest scores.
