The 2013 draft saw a run on the fourth-down specialists, and we could see that again this May., 103846=The class is helped overall by the quarterbacks. Teddy Bridgewater, Blake Bortles, Johnny Manziel and Derek Carr all carry a first-round grade, as opposed to the 2013 class that had just one quarterback (EJ Manuel) drafted in the first round., 142807=With eight players ranked inside my top 50, you can see why the wide-receiver position is one of my favorite groups in the 2014 draft., 103631=From top to bottom, the 2014 draft is a very good class. Better than the 2013 group but not quite on par with the 2012 class, this year we see a crop of football players with tremendous potential., 104412=Here are the top 300 players in the 2014 draft class, separated by position, from top to bottom., 165934=Whatever your preference at the position, the 2014 class has a player for you., 106909=The group has four quarterbacks, five offensive tackles, four outside linebackers and four excellent defensive tackles. Sprinkle in three dominant defensive ends, four game-changing wide receivers, two tight ends and three cornerbacks, and you have a very good top 32 to headline the 2014 class., 165470=The 2014 class of tight ends will only add to that. This group features two top-tier talents (Eric Ebron and Jace Amaro) followed by a strong second tier of players featuring guys who are ready to be starters in the NFL., 195578=Pitt's Aaron Donald was one of the most decorated players in college football during the 2013 season and would step into the NFL as an ideal 3-technique pass-rusher. The same goes for Timmy Jernigan, who saved his best for last and dominated the BCS title game.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "\u00a0 With underclassmen Teddy Bridgewater, Blake Bortles and Johnny Manziel adding to a strong senior class, this year looks to put at least three quarterbacks (and probably four) in the first round. Seniors Derek Carr and Jimmy Garoppolo took advantage of the Senior Bowl to improve their stock, while SEC stars Aaron Murray and Zach Mettenberger will attempt to rehab torn ACLs in time to impress NFL scouts. After a year in which only one quarterback (EJ Manuel) went in the first round, the 2014 NFL draft class looks strong.
