By not performing poorly in any specific area, Seattle's overall ranking is relatively high., 29973=The easiest visualization for me is to imagine a bunch of really sucky teams with one good aspect each. For example, a team with horrid defense and ST, but a top-5 offense. They'd rank behind a 10-10-10 team overall, even though one facet is better. Do that with a few teams, and it's not a stretch to get a discrepancy between average rankings (e.g. the 10-10-10) and the overall placement., 98015=Last year was the introduction of DAVE, but actually a terrible year to use for judging DAVE. 2005-2006 had a lower correlation of year-to-year DVOA compared to previous years and the projection correlated to actual performance worse than in previous years. Trust me, when we look back at 2001-2006 and not just 2006, DAVE is more accurate., 21586=Posted by: Aaron Schatz on 11 Sep 2007}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Seriously, after four years the DVOA ratings and/or preseason projections have been higher than conventional wisdom on every team a few times, and lower than conventional wisdom on every team a few times. We could easily go back into the archives to find reasons why Football Outsiders has a bias in favor of all 32 teams and against all 32 teams. If you make a bias complaint at this point, you just look like an idiot. <team> is clearly ranked <too high/too low> because <reason unrelated to DVOA>. <subjective ranking system> is way better than this. <unrelated team-supporting or -denigrating comment, preferably with poor spelling and/or chat-acceptable spelling> To save people some time, please use the following format for all complaints: There are no opponent adjustments in VOA until the fourth week of the season, which is why it is VOA right now rather than DVOA. OFFENSE and DEFENSE VOA are adjusted to consider all fumbles, kept or lost, as equal value. SPECIAL TEAMS DVOA is adjusted for type of stadium (warm, cold, dome, Denver/Mexico City) and week of season. These are the Football Outsiders team efficiency ratings through one week of 2007, measured by our proprietary Defense-adjusted Value Over Average (DVOA) system that breaks down every single play and compares a team's performance to the league average based on situation in order to determine value over average.

WITHOUT A PK and with their rookie punter handling kickoffs. How the 'ell does that happen? 2 by Charles the Philly Homer (not verified) :: Tue, 09/11/2007 - 2:04pm I spit my drink over the Giants defensive VOA. Of course, nobody in my fantasy league believes my constant reservations re: a Mr. Romo, but at least some statistics support the argument that he was essentially throwing to the most open receivers I've ever seen. Well, short of training-camp practice fields. 3 by Al H (not verified) :: Tue, 09/11/2007 - 2:09pm sam, I think it was balanced by the rather nice kickoff returns of MJD. 4 by B (not verified) :: Tue, 09/11/2007 - 2:12pm",
