    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{42805=Update (May 15): Adam Lyth has now been called into the England Test squad and will probably make his debut against New Zealand., 66206=For starters, the England-France match equalled the highest total number of tries in a 6N match (12) and was the second highest points total with 90. The only match that surpasses it in points (and equals it in tries) is the England-Italy match from 2001, but that was an 81-23 thrashing, mid-tournament., 67597=In those years, the outcome of the tournament was also in the balance on the final weekend. Wales won in 2005, securing the Grand Slam, although France had racked up seven tries against Italy to keep their title hopes alive. In 2007, France scored a last-minute try to take the title over Ireland by just 4 points. And in 2014, Ireland\u2019s narrow 2-point victory over France (again with last-minute drama) gave them the title on points difference over England., 66989=In total, 27 tries were scored on the last day of the 2015 6N. That\u2019s 44 per cent of the tries scored in the whole competition. Compare that to 2012, when just four tries were scored on the last day., 72770=In the Double-winning 2009/10 campaign, when we were the country\u2019s outstanding attacking team, we were awarded 12 league penalties., 5417=FOOTBALL You might hate Sepp Blatter, but he understands the world better than you, you irrelevant Westerner. Meanwhile, Qatar\u2019s World Cup death rate is now over 60 per match, and Brazil\u2019s 2014 legacy is already a mess., 67204=The only other years that come close are 2005, 2007 and 2014, which also saw 20 or more tries on the last day (also all above 30 per cent of the total tries)., 73896=Two other teams have also been awarded 12 penalties in one campaign. Can you guess which teams they are? Have a go. Other league winners? Nope. In fact, it was Liverpool, in 2013-14 when they finished second; and Crystal Palace, in 2004-05, finishing in 18th place!, 75186=Put another way: only four times in the sixteen years of data have the team winning the league also been awarded the most penalties (Arsenal 2001-02, Manchester United 2002-03, 2007-08 and Chelsea 2009-10). Penalties are\u00a0not some divine right of the best team. History shows that a team can be given a lot of penalties and still finish low down the league. Just ask Palace. Or Sunderland (6 penalties, 14th place last year). Or Blackpool (8 penalties, 19th place in 2010-11). Or West Ham (9 penalties, 17th place in 2009-10)., 81192=Peter Moores: \u2018We\u2019ll have to have a look at the data.\u2019 That one sentence should stand as lasting indictment of England cricket in 2015., 81344=\u2014 Oliver Brown (@oliverbrown_tel) March 9, 2015, 108511=\u00a9 2015 Rob Minto, 73601=Chelsea did indeed get 12 penalties in 2009-10. But this is an outlier \u2013 in fact, for all the penalties data I could get from the 1998-99 season onwards, it is the highest number given to one team in a single season., 81838=\u2014 Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) March 9, 2015, 61521=But since 2005, there have been none below the 17 second mark. As the chart below of the rolling 10-year average shows, since 1999 the times are getting slower. (I\u2019ve used the 10-year average to smooth out what is otherwise a very bumpy chart, and show the trend. The average also mitigates the impact of the bad-weather years.), 61152=For many years, as boat\u00a0technology improved and crews trained harder and smarter, and the rowers became international pros, the winning time came down. From the 1950s to 2000, typical times went from around 20 minutes to 17. The course record was set in 1998, at 16:19 by Cambridge. From 1996 to 2005, 5 of the 10 winning times were sub-17 seconds., 48750=(In 2011 Marcus Trescothick was the leading run scorer and had the highest average in county cricket, but had retired from the England team. In 2010 the most runs were scored by Mark Ramprakash \u2013 again, retired from the England team.)}",
    "textBeforeTable": "But if you look at the players who have scored the highest total runs in a county season, or had the\u00a0highest average over a season (excluding overseas players and retired England players), there is a better chance of picked for the Test side. Adam Lyth would seem to have a better claim for a Test place then KP. All of the above players have hit 250-plus in county cricket. None have been picked for England\u2019s senior Test side. Alex Gidman Alex Lees James Hildreth Andrew Gale Adam Lyth If it was, then here are a list of people who would have been picked for England in the last 5 years: This is nothing to do with that book (the one that trashed the ECB, former and current coaches and captains). It is quite simply that one innings isn\u2019t enough. KP has been misguided and is confused, and here\u2019s why. \u201cAll I can do is score runs, that\u2019s it. \u201cI\u2019ve got runs, I\u2019ve got a county and I do believe I\u2019m good enough to play for England. \u201cAll I\u2019ve been asked to do by the chairman-elect is to get a county and get runs,\u201d said Pietersen. He thinks so. He said afterwards: When a player hits 300-plus for their county, it\u2019s hard not to take notice. But should Kevin Pietersen\u2019s massive innings for Surrey get him back in the team? \u2014\u2013 Update (May 15): Adam Lyth has now",
