Don't take a chance with inferior, untested brands; your eyesight is simply too valuable to risk. Compare Formulations In the 6-year AREDS research, scientists found that supplementation with lutein, beta-carotene, vitamins E and C, zinc, and copper helped to support and preserve long-term eye health, helping to support a healthy macula and normal vision.3 Beta-Carotene Studies indicate that lutein supplementation supports visual acuity in older patients. One study examined subjects' tolerance to glare. After 4 months of taking lutein and zeaxanthin daily, glare tolerance greatly increased. By 6 months, the time needed for subjects to see clearly again after viewing a bright glaring light significantly decreased.2 Lutein In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, subjects given 50 mg of black currant anthocyanosides (BCA) adapted significantly better to the dark than those receiving the placebo. What's most impressive is those night vision improvements happened in just 30 minutes! After taking BCA, the study participants were able to make out images significantly sooner. Plus, they had less eye fatigue when performing a visually tiring task.1 Billberry and Black Currant Anthocyanosides Science and Quality Science & Quality }); } window.location.hash = 'tab-reviews'; doShowContent : function () { $BV.ui( 'rr', 'show_reviews', {",
