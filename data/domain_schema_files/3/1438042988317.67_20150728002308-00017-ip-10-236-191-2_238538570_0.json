    "textAfterTable": "As the origin for the leap day cocktail is rather clear, we don\u2019t see a ton of variation. Slate\u2019s version is by the far most different, opting for an increased quantity of lemon juice. Savoy Stomp\u2019s quantities aren\u2019t actually different, they instead opt for precision of the original\u2019s quantities. 2/3 of the glass measurement used in the the original book is approximately 1/2 of 3/4 of an ounce. For you fraction addicts out there, 3/8 of an ounce will do. Happy Leap Day!
