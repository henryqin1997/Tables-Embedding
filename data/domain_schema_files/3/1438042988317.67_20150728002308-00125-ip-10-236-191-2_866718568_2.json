In each location, we interviewed the Chief Deputy, warrant supervisor/coordinator, investigative research analyst, and several District Marshals. In addition, we conducted telephone interviews with either the Chief Deputy, warrant supervisor/coordinator (or both) at USMS district offices in: Phoenix, Arizona; San Francisco and San Diego, California; Houston, Texas; Shreveport, Louisiana; Utica, New York; and Miami, Florida. These sites were chosen based on the districts' size, their September 1998 QPI score, and the number of warrants received in FY 1997 (the most current USMS annual report statistics available). In addition, backlog was considered if the district was one of the top 12 districts with a warrant backlog as of September 30, 1998 (See Table 3)., 5359=The USMS provided us with WIN records on all USMS warrants closed from FY 1994 through FY 1998.

We excluded warrants not closed by the USMS. We received over 50 data fields for each warrant. For example, the fugitive identification number (FID), the warrant identification number, the warrant closure date, the type of warrant executed (e.g., probation violations, bond defaults), the manner that the warrant was executed (e.g., physical arrest, surrender), the fugitive's criminal history, and the QPI score., 10170=We applied the USMS current backlog definition from FY 1994 through FY 1998 to assess trends in backlog reduction and to determine whether USMS was meeting its goal to reduce the backlog. Our database included only closed warrants, therefore we requested that the USMS run a report of the number of backlogged warrants at the end of each FY. The USMS has changed the definition of backlog during the years in our evaluation, so we requested the USMS to apply the current definition to each FY we examined. The current definition of backlog includes all warrants over one year old except for those warrants USMS considers unworkable. Unworkable warrants are for incarcerated fugitives who have a detainer in their file; warrants for fugitives who are out of the country and cannot be extradited to the United States; and warrants where the DEA has retained its investigative authority., 449=Follow-up Inspection of the United States Marshals Service's Fugitive Apprehension Program Report Number I-2000-02 January 2000}",

Based on a structured questionnaire, we manually coded all responses and entered the data into the database. The database provided us with a tool to evaluate the responses from all districts simultaneously and compare responses by specific questions. Data from the WIN System The USMS provided us with WIN records on all USMS warrants closed from FY 1994 through FY 1998.

For each FY, the USMS provided data saved as text files in three different tables (a total of 15 tables). Below is a description of each table. The Profile Table contained information on the fugitive's criminal history such as the numbers and types of crimes for which the fugitive was previously arrested and convicted.
