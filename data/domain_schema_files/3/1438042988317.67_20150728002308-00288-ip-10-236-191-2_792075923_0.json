Craft A Shelby County jury convicted the Defendant, Criss Williams, of the second degree murder of Jerry Washington. Subsequently, the trial court sentenced the Defendant to twenty-five years of incarceration. The Defendant challenges his conviction arguing that (1) the evidence was insufficient to convict him, because the state failed to prove his identity as the shooter, and (2) that the trial court erred in not granting his Motion for Judgment of Acquittal. After a thorough review of the record, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.",
