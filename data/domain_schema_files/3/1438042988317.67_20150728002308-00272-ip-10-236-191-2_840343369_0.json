Bucs\u2019 pitchers struck out 7.1 batters per 9 innings in April. Last season they struck out 6.4/9 innings in\u00a0March/April\u00a0and had a high mark of 6.9 K/9 in July. Newcomers Erik Bedard (8.1 K/9) and A.J. Burnett (10.1) have a lot to do with the higher number, as does Jeff Karstens\u2018 injury keeping him off the mound (3.8)., 31059=The Pirates held on for a great win against the Braves last night, 4-2. Erik Bedard struck out 9 in 5 innings. Pedro Alvarez had 2 doubles. Jason Grilli and Joel Hanrahan struck 5 in two innings and Nate McLouth overcame resounding boos to make a leaping catch against the wall for the last out. Same two teams go again today at 1:35., 8774=Summary: The Pirates are probably an average team and in April they played like one; sometimes good, sometimes bad, usually somewhere in between. Theoretically, the upcoming easier schedule should allow them to get a few extra wins and go back above .500., 9064=Filed under: baseball, Pirates | Tagged: A.J. Burnett, April, baseball, Erik Bedard, Jeff Karstens, Pirates, Recap | Leave a comment \u00bb, 12012=Earlier I posted a little about Pedro Alvarez, but I want to reiterate that he was their best player this weekend. He looked loose and confident, which was a marked difference from how I saw him in March. Andrew McCutchen on the other hand looked to be pressing to get the big hit every time up. If both of those guys were hitting at the same time, watch out., 45376=Gametime: 1:35, 6385=The Pirates finished April with a 10-12 record. They got there by winning two in a row twice, losing five in a row once and alternating wins and losses the rest of the time., 7865=Pirates\u2019 April opponents had a combined .570 winning percentage (90-68). That\u2019s like playing a playoff team every game for a month. The only team on the schedule under .500 was 11-12 Philadelphia. May\u2019s schedule should be easier. The teams on the docket combined for only a 113-110 record (.507) in April.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Combined Box All four starters looked good. I watched James McDonald warm up in the bullpen and he was all over the place. When he started so shaky in the first and second it looked like it was going to be a long game. But as he sometimes does, he figured it out and shut the door on the Braves from that point on. Earlier I posted a little about Pedro Alvarez, but I want to reiterate that he was their best player this weekend. He looked loose and confident, which was a marked difference from how I saw him in March. Andrew McCutchen on the other hand looked to be pressing to get the big hit every time up. If both of those guys were hitting at the same time, watch out. Splitting four games on the road versus a good team is a very acceptable result. Nice to see the bats come alive too. Season Record: 10-12, 4th place in the NL Central Scores: Friday: 6-1 Loss at Atlanta. One bad inning from the bullpen. Box score. Saturday: 4-2 Win at Atlanta. Score early and hang on late. Solid pitching. Box score. Sunday: 4-3 Loss at Atlanta. Sloppy defense, 1 for 13 with RISP. Box score. Monday: 9-3 Win at Atlanta. Finally, the bats break out. Box score.
