Minnesota State University, Mankato is a member of Minnesota State Colleges & Universities system and an affirmative action/equal opportunity university., 44764=Owner: Admissions Last Modified: 2015-05-26, 23971=Phone Number: 507-389-2422 E-mail: brian.jones@mnsu.edu, 25040=Advice to incoming Mavericks: My advice to incoming Mavericks would be to be open minded. College is a great time to explore what your interest are, try new things, and meet new people from all over the globe. It may seem at first, but trust me\u2026 If you stick to it, you will have a lifetime of memories! The most frequently played song on your iPod: I can't choose just ONE! I'm a big R&B junkie. I love Fantasia, Jennifer Hudson, Brandy, Letoya Luckett, Usher, Tamar Braxton, Toni Braxton, Monica, Elle Varner\u2026 and the list goes on! What was your first job: My first job was working with a company called Tree Trust. Outside cleaning up highways and planting, long story short I quit after 3 days! What job would you have if you listened to your 6 year old self: If I listened to my 6 year old self Oprah would have a run for her money! I would be the best talk show host on television. Watch out daytime, here comes Ms. Paulette! =) The best thing about MSU is: On campus fairs because it's almost always a guarantee that there will be free. Also, I love when it gets warm out and everyone is outside barbequing, rollerblading, on walks, and doing other activities. It just makes Mankato feel a little more like home. Describe MSU in one word: MAVPRIDE Cookies\u2026crunchy or soft: Not a huge cookie person. CANDY all the way. If I had to choose a cookie, I would say crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. When you aren't working what you are doing: When I'm not working or thinking about work (which often happened ;) I'm singing so loud my neighbors can probably hear me, on my cell phone (go figure), shopping, cooking, camping (I know right!), hanging out with family and friends, and enjoying life.}",
