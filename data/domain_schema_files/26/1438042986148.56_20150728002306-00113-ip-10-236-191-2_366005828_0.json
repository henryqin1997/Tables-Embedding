In order to give students studying in the Graduate Centre as much notice as possible of these potential disruptions, we have compiled the following list of known upcoming events taking place in Y Plas only (other events may take place in the Great Hall or CF10 but these are unlikely to affect activities in the Graduate Centre). Please note that this may not be a complete list of Y Plas events as some events may be scheduled at short notice. Normal clubnights during term time are on either a Wednesday or Saturday evening. For an up to date list of the unions planned clubnights: http://www.cardiffstudents.com/whatson/bars-club/\u00a0 Due to the Graduate Centre being located above the Students' Union Y Plas nightclub / music venue, from time to time the centre is subject to noise disruption caused by loud events, i.e. club night and gigs, taking place in Y Plas.
