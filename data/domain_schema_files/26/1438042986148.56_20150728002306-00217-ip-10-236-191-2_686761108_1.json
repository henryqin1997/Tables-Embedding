This as part of the long awaited 3B9R DXpedition operation. Ned posted on the VHF Reflector that he hoped to be on Rodriguez in grid MH10 the evening of March 31st. If all went well, he should have been fully operational on April 1st, starting with the morning contact opportunities to Japan. He says that he plans to be listening on 50.115 MHZ and will transmit on the normal 6 meter DX frequencies., 10042=Bell Atlantic was the first to throw in the towel. In December it sold off its 1,427 towers to a joint venture with Crown Castle International Corp. Bell Atlantic got $380 million in cash and a 37.7% equity stake in the joint venture, worth $240 million., 8230=Six wireless carriers now compete in most of the top 15 U.S. markets. It's a buyer's market. But the supply of choice transmission sites is short. With at least 92 million dropped or interrupted calls every month, demand for better wireless coverage is intense. There are now about 65,000 towers in the U.S. Carriers will need 35,000 more by 2004., 19707=Please mark June 26-27, 1999 on your calendars. THAT IS FIELD DAY WEEKEND!!!, 22222=If the name Ned Stearns AA7A, sounds familiar, that's because he was a frequent guest and occasional co-host with Len Winkler, KB7LPW, of the now-defunct \"Ham Radio and More\" radio program. Ned plans for AA7A to be running 100 Watts to a long yagi antenna. The station will be located in the town of Port Matherin on the north central side of the island with an unobstructed view of the horizon and on to Japan and Europe. Six meter operations from the island will end on April 11th., 17644=Piedmont-Coastal Repeater Network (PCRN) - Ed, AB4S, gave no formal report, but he suggested the attendees re-read the Minutes in the February FEEDLINE. That was of the \"rule\" that every Amateur who uses repeaters locally, should support their own local repeater. Then, they will feel more comfortable using a repeater away from their home territory. The PCRN does a great job of keeping many repeaters across NC up and running. The labor is donated, BUT the equipment does require some monies. The suggested annual donation is: $15. The mailing address is: PCRN, P. O. Box 12734, Raleigh, NC 27605. They take checks, U.S. funds, gold and silver bullion, rare coins, bearer bonds and other negotiable securities, etc. You really have little excuse for NOT supporting PCRN., 17301=Meeting opened at 7:34 p.m., by Pres., Charles, KE4CDI. All introduced themselves., 7669=REAL ESTATE STOCKS are in the dumps. From operators of trailer parks to collections of Class A office space, the shares of real estate companies are down 26% from September., 23414=Later this year, the cost of applying for an amateur vanity callsign is expected to rise slightly. In a just-released Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the FCC has proposed increasing the vanity fee to $14.20 for the 10 year term. The current vanity fee is $13. The FCC projects 6800 vanity applications in Fiscal Year 1999 for a total revenue figure of more than $96,000. The NPRM itself involves the assessment and collection of regulatory fees for Fiscal Year 1999., 19419=Bob, K4HA, is getting tee shirts with appropriate logos bragging about the great 1998 Field Day showing that CARC made. They have been custom ordered by size. The nominal cost is $10. Frank KE4ZEQ will have the shirts at the club meeting . Thanks, Bob., 7879=But one obscure corner of the real estate business, one that's only a few years old, is in a bull market: wireless towers. This bane of every neighborhood zoning czar is emerging as the hot new play. Shares of the two top publicly traded companies (see table) that own towers are up an average 52% since September., 4969=On Saturday, April 3, Danny K4ITL, Mike WB4TQD, and Bob K4HA made a visit to the 147.15 repeater site to troubleshoot the reduced coverage on both talkout and talkin. An earlier inspection my Mike had revealed that the SWR at the bottom end of the 800 ft transmission line was about 1.6 : 1. With 800 ft of 7/8 inch Heliax, this makes the actual SWR at the fault (assuming it's at the top end of the cable), much higher. Mike climbed the tower and about 40 minutes later he was up top (I knew he was doing that daily workout for some reason!). The jumper that went from the end of the transmission line to the pigtail on the antenna was bad. The elements had just taken their toll on it. Basically the repeater was transmitting on this little open piece of transmission line that was up there at 800 ft. That fixed the talkout coverage problem., 8614=Demand for good sites is so intense that Samuel Zell's Chicago-based Equity Office Properties has seen rents for its rooftops double since 1996, to more than $1,600. In contrast, rents for the new office space below are only up 25%., 9331=With this new Boston-based company, Dodge kept control of the towers the stations used, figuring correctly, that he would have no problem renting antenna space on the towers to cellular phone operators. Shares now trade at $25. American Tower has 3,200 towers, more than any firm in the U.S., and it is buying and building rapidly. Dodge aims to have 10,000 by 2003., 24071=Feedline is a member-supported publication of the Cary Amateur Radio Club and is published monthly. Deadline for submissions is the second Thursday of the month. Editor: Tom Klimala, KM4LB 1545 Seabrook Avenue Cary, North Carolina 27511 klimala@cwix.com, 16043=*Est. 1999 pro forma U.S. operations, excludes managed towers and corporate expenses. Operating income equals net before depreciation, interest and taxes. \ufffd Excluding U.K. operations., 8883=Steven Dodge sees the value in such vertical real estate. In 1995 the former lending officer at BankBoston took his American Radio Corp. public at $16.50 a share, then sold the company's 100 radio stations to CBS three years later in a deal worth $2.6 billion. For each American Radio share, Dodge's original investors got $44 in cash and one share, worth $21, of a newly created public company, American Tower.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Titans of tower Someday there will be a glut of wireless towers. But that's a few years off. Expect more deals like these. Already rural affiliates of AT&T and Sprint are using the tower companies to do the building and managing for them. Clark not only plans to increase the number of cellular tenants on the former Nextel towers, but he also won the rights to build 1,700 more towers for Nextel over the next five years. Build a hotel and you have to fluff the pillows every day. \"With a tower, all you have to do is put down the weed killer and mow the grass,\" says SpectraSite's chief executive, Stephen Clark. American Tower's Dodge gets an average of 4.5 tenants on each of his towers in Florida. In a city, of course, he has to pay rooftop rent to a Sam Zell. Still, Dodge says that in some areas he's seeing a 40% cash-on-cash return, meaning that if he spends $200,000 on a site he will pocket $80,000-a-year over and above the minimal operating costs. But the potential is certainly there. Towers positioned on the ground cost about $200,000 to build. Operating costs hover around $10,000 a year no matter if there's one tenant or ten. Rents run from $2,200 a month per tenant for a city like Boston down to $500 in a rural area. Where's all",

Feedline's April Brainteaser A simple series DC circuit consists of a 10 volt DC source, and two resistors in series. The first resistor is a known value (5 Ohms). The value on the second resistor is missing, but someone measures the heat coming from the resistor and determines that it is dissipating 3 Watts of power. What is the value of the resistor?

CARC Minutes - W3HL Meeting opened at 7:34 p.m., by Pres., Charles, KE4CDI. All introduced themselves. Treasurer's Report - The report from Will, K4IWW, was read in his absence as: Savings, $1,210.83; Checking, $1,107.78; C-O-H, $87.00; Total, $2,405.61. Dues are due at this (March) meeting.
