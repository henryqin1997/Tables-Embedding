            "The effects of the deflation of the Bank of England crossed the Atlantic Ocean to North America and disrupted commercial and real estate markets in the United States and the Caribbean. Britain\u2018s economy was greatly affected by developing disflationary repercussions because it was fighting France in the French Revolutionary Wars at the time.",
            "The Embargo Act of 1807 was passed by the United States Congress under President Thomas Jefferson. It devastated shipping-related industries. The Federalists fought the embargo and allowed smuggling to take place in New England.",
            "The first major financial crisis in the United States featured widespread foreclosures, bank failures, unemployment, and a slump in agriculture and manufacturing. It also marked the end of the economic expansion that followed the War of 1812.",
            "A sharp downturn in the American economy was caused by bank failures and lack of confidence in the paper currency. Speculation markets were greatly affected when American banks stopped payment in specie (gold and silver coinage).",
            "Failure of the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company burst a European speculative bubble in United States railroads and caused a loss of confidence in American banks. Over 5,000 businesses failed within the first year of the Panic, and unemployment was accompanied by protest meetings in urban areas.",
            "Economic problems in Europe prompted the failure of the Jay Cooke & Company, the largest bank in the United States, which burst the post-Civil War speculative bubble. The Coinage Act of 1873 also contributed by immediately depressing the price of silver, which hurt North American mining interests.",
            "The collapse of the Vienna Stock Exchange caused a depression that spread throughout the world. It is important to note that during this period, the global industrial production greatly increased. In the United States, for example, industrial output increased fourfold.",
            "Failure of the United States Reading Railroad and withdrawal of European investment led to a stock market and banking collapse. This Panic was also precipitated in part by a run on the gold supply.",
            "A run on Knickerbocker Trust Company deposits on October 22, 1907, set events in motion that would lead to a severe monetary contraction.",
            "Severe hyperinflation in Europe took place over production in North America. It was a brief but very sharp recession and was caused by the end of wartime production, along with an influx of labor from returning troops. This in turn caused high unemployment.",
            "Stock markets crashed worldwide, and a banking collapse took place in the United States. Although sometimes dated as lasting until the Second World War, the US economy was growing again by 1933, and technically the U.S. was not in recession from 1933 to 1937",
            "The Recession of 1937 is only considered minor when compared to the Great Depression, but is otherwise among the worst recessions of the 20th century.",
            "The decline in government spending at the end of World War II led to an enormous drop in Gross Domestic Product making this technically a recession. The Post War years were unusual in a number of ways and this era has little in common with other recessions.",
            "The 1948 recession was a relatively brief cyclical economic downturn, the mildness of which led to confidence in the notion that the Post War-era would be a period of stronger growth.",
            "After a post-Korean War inflationary period, more funds were transferred into national security. The Federal Reserve changed monetary policy to be more restrictive in 1952 due to fears of further inflation.",
            "Monetary policy was tightened during the two years preceding 1957, followed by an easing of policy at the end of 1957. The budget balance resulted in a change in budget surplus of 0.8% of GDP in 1957 to a budget deficit of 0.6% of GDP in 1958, and then to 2.6% of GDP in 1959.",
            "After President Kennedy\u2019s 30 January 1961 call for increased government spending to improve the Gross National Product and to reduce unemployment, the 1960-61 recession ended in February.[28]",
            "The relatively mild 1969 recession is thought to have been mostly caused by the Federal Reserve raising interest rates to hold down inflation.",
            "A quadrupling of oil prices by OPEC coupled with high government spending due to the Vietnam War led to stagflation in the United States.",
            "The NBER considers a short recession to have occurred in 1980, followed by a short period of growth and then a deep recession. Unemployment remained relatively elevated inbetween recessions. The early \u201980s are sometimes referred to as a \u201cdouble dip\u201d or \u201cw-shaped\u201d recession.",
            "The Iranian Revolution sharply increased the price of oil around the world in 1979, causing the 1979 energy crisis. This was caused by the new regime in power in Iran, which exported oil at inconsistent intervals and at a lower volume, forcing prices to go up. Tight monetary policy in the United States to control inflation led to another recession. The changes were made largely because of inflation that was carried over from the previous decade due to the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis.",
            "Industrial production and manufacturing-trade sales increased in early 1991.",
            "The collapse of the dot-com bubble, the September 11th attacks, and accounting scandals contributed to a relatively mild contraction in the North American economy.",
            "The collapse of the housing market led to bank collapses in the US and Europe, causing the amount of available credit to be sharply curtailed, resulting in huge liquidity and solvency crises. In addition, record oil prices and food prices, stock markets crashed globally, and several high profile banking, automotive, and manufacturing giants collapsed in the United States"

They usually do, saying as always that either gasoline supplies or crude oil on hand is in short supply, hence the increased prices. But that hasn\u2019t been true. Gasoline inventories on Dec. 17 were 217 million barrels, slightly more than gasoline inventories in the last week of February 2009\u2014when the price of crude neared $33 a barrel in the wake of the previous fall\u2019s financial meltdown., 169509=There were more than 25,000,000 Americans unemployed\u00a0 seeking a full time job in May 2009., 239260=\u201c\u2026Harding suffered a stroke and died in San Francisco on August 2, 1923. \u201cAt the time of his death, no president was more popular and admired,\u201d John W. Dean wrote in his biography of Harding. Harding\u2019s body was returned to Washington on a funeral train. According to Dean, \u201cThis trip, reported in every newspaper in the land, resulted in a public outpouring of sentiment the likes of which had not been experienced by the nation since the death of Abraham Lincoln, and would not occur again until the death of Franklin Roosevelt. An estimated 9 million people from factories and farms, schools and shops, in the cities and in the fields, spontaneously appeared along the railroad tracks to silently \u2013 and often in tears \u2013 pay last respects to a president they admired, a friend they\u2019d lost.\u201d, 137542=Schiff is a supporter of the Austrian School of Economics and the Ludwig von Mises Institute[5], and was an economic adviser for Ron Paul\u2019s campaign in the 2008 Republican Party primaries, through which Schiff also expressed support for sound money, limited government, and free market capitalism., 161815=In 1933 there were over 12,800,000 individuals unemployed and seeking a full time job., 109559=At this rate, it won\u2019t take long until skyrocketing oil and gasoline prices drag the current economic recovery to a halt. Worse, if oil and gasoline prices go up for consumers and business in 2011 by a substantial amount, reducing the unemployment numbers may not be possible. \u2026\u201d, 278046=If Coolidge made 1929 inevitable, it was President Hoover who prolonged and deepened the depression, transforming it from a typically sharp but swiftly-disappearing depression into a lingering and near-fatal malady, a malady \u201ccured\u201d only by the holocaust of World War II. Hoover, not Franklin Roosevelt, was the founder of the policy of the \u201cNew Deal\u201d: essentially the massive use of the State to do exactly what Misesian theory would most warn against \u2013 to prop up wage rates above their free-market levels, prop up prices, inflate credit, and lend money to shaky business positions. Roosevelt only advanced, to a greater degree, what Hoover had pioneered. The result for the first time in American history, was a nearly perpetual depression and nearly permanent mass unemployment. The Coolidge crisis had become the unprecedentedly prolonged Hoover-Roosevelt depression., 234470=America\u2019s greatest depression fighter was Warren Gamaliel Harding. An Ohio senator when he was elected president in 1920, he followed Woodrow Wilson who got America into World War I, contributed to the deaths of 116,708 Americans, built up huge federal bureaucracies, imprisoned dissenters and incurred $25 billion of debt, for which he has been much praised by historians., 280659=What swamped the growing acceptance of Misesian cycle theory was simply the \u201cKeynesian Revolution\u201d \u2013 the amazing sweep that Keynesian theory made of the economic world shortly after the publication of the General Theory in 1936. It is not that Misesian theory was refuted successfully; it was just forgotten in the rush to climb on the suddenly fashionable Keynesian bandwagon.

The low point for federal taxes was reached in 1924. For federal spending, in 1925.

Gallaway, in their book Out of Work (1993), noted that the magnitude of the 1920 depression \u201cexceeded that for the Great Depression of the following decade for several quarters.\u201d The estimated gross national product plunged 24% from $91.5\u00a0billion in 1920 to $69.6\u00a0billion in 1921.

These were to be two of the \u201cFour Horsemen of Reaction\u201d who, during the 1930s, courageously struck down FDR\u2019s early New Deal legislation that had been suppressing recovery\u2026.\u201d, 244714=\u201c\u2026It is commonly argued that World War II provided the stimulus that brought the American economy out of the Great Depression. The number of unemployed workers declined by 7,050,000 between 1940 and 1943, but the number in military service rose by 8,590,000. The reduction in unemployment can be explained by the draft, not by the economic recovery. The rise in real GNP presents similar problems. Most estimates show declines in real consumption spending, which means that consumers were worse off during the war. Business investment fell during the war. Government spending on the war effort exceeded the expansion in real GNP. These figures are suspect, however, because we know that government estimates of the value of munitions spending, to name one major area, were increasingly exaggerated as the war progressed. In fact, the extensive price controls, rationing, and government control of production render data on GNP, consumption, investment, and the price level less meaningful. How can we establish a consistent price index when government mandates eliminated the production of most consumer durable goods? What does the price of, say, gasoline mean when it is arbitrarily held at a low level and gasoline purchases are rationed to address the shortage created by the price controls? What does the price of new tires mean when no new tires are produced for consumers? For consumers, the recovery came with the war\u2019s end, when they could again buy products that were unavailable during the war and unaffordable during the 1930s. \u2026\u201d, 136820=Peter David Schiff (born March 23, 1963)[1] is an American economic commentator, author and licensed stock broker who currently serves as president of Euro Pacific Capital Inc., a brokerage firm based in Darien, Connecticut which he owns.[2], 310382=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/12/postponing_reality.html, 139815=http://peterschiff.wordpress.com/2009/06/19/peter-schiff-blog/, 146493=\u201cIt is estimated that in 1933, at the depth of the Great Depression, about 13 million persons in the U.S. were unemployed, which translates into an unemployment rate of about 25 percent.1 However, those estimates were not available at the time. Throughout the Great Depression, there was little information on the extent of unemployment in the country. More important, there was no good way to assess whether the situation was getting better or worse. The wealth of timely statistical information on the labor market that we now take for granted simply didn\u2019t exist.\u201d, 170478=The Ugly Depression is the 2009-2010\u00a0 depression\u2013The Obama Depression\u2013 of the radical socialist Democratic Party., 278960=Ludwig von Mises had predicted the depression during the heyday of the great boom of the 1920s \u2013 a time, just like today, when economists and politicians, armed with a \u201cnew economics\u201d of perpetual inflation, and with new \u201ctools\u201d provided by the Federal Reserve System, proclaimed a perpetual \u201cNew Era\u201d of permanent prosperity guaranteed by our wise economic doctors in Washington. Ludwig von Mises, alone armed with a correct theory of the business cycle, was one of the very few economists to predict the Great Depression, and hence the economic world was forced to listen to him with respect. F. A. Hayek spread the word in England, and the younger English economists were all, in the early 1930s, beginning to adopt the Misesian cycle theory for their analysis of the depression \u2013 and also to adopt, of course, the strictly free-market policy prescription that flowed with this theory. Unfortunately, economists have now adopted the historical notion of Lord Keynes: That no \u201cclassical economists\u201d had a theory of the business cycle until Keynes came along in 1936. There was a theory of the depression; it was the classical economic tradition; its prescription was strict hard money and laissez-faire; and it was rapidly being adopted, in England and even in the United States, as the accepted theory of the business cycle. (A particular irony is that the major \u201cAustrian\u201d proponent in the United States in the early and mid-1930s was none other than Professor Alvin Hansen, very soon to make his mark as the outstanding Keynesian disciple in this country.), 92267=Posted on January 18, 2011.

The number of unemployed fell to 2.8\u00a0million \u2013 a reported 6.7% of the labor force \u2013 in 1922. So, just a year and a half after Harding became president, the Roaring 20s were underway! The unemployment rate continued to decline, reaching a low of 1.8% in 1926 \u2013 an extraordinary feat.

Although the Great Depression was relatively mild in some countries, it was severe in others, particularly in the United States, where, at its nadir in 1933, 25 percent of all workers and 37 percent of all nonfarm workers were completely out of work. Some people starved; many others lost their farms and homes. Homeless vagabonds sneaked aboard the freight trains that crossed the nation. Dispossessed cotton farmers, the \u201cOkies,\u201d stuffed their possessions into dilapidated Model Ts and migrated to California in the false hope that the posters about plentiful jobs were true. Although the U.S. economy began to recover in the second quarter of 1933, the recovery largely stalled for most of 1934 and 1935. A more vigorous recovery commenced in late 1935 and continued into 1937, when a new depression occurred. The American economy had yet to fully recover from the Great Depression when the United States was drawn into World War II in December 1941. Because of this agonizingly slow recovery, the entire decade of the 1930s in the United States is often referred to as the Great Depression. \u2026\u201d, 108969=Fact is, we have more oil on hand today (13 million barrels) and just three million barrels of gasoline less than we did at the end of January 1999, a period when gasoline prices were down near the $1 mark. As for strong economic growth dictating higher oil and gas prices, it should be noted that our GDP grew 5.4 percent in late 1998\u2014and growth would improve to 7.1 percent at the start of 1999. Yet gasoline was a buck a gallon. \u2026\u201d, 162226=The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u00a0 total unemployment rate (U-6) for May 2009 was 16.4% which includes marginally attached, discouraged and part-time workers seeking full time job., 237711=\u201cThe seven years from the autumn of 1922 to the autumn of 1929,\u201d wrote Vedder and Gallaway, \u201cwere arguably the brightest period in the economic history of the United States.

Real gross national product increased every year, consumer prices were stable (as measured by the consumer price index), real wages rose as a consequence of productivity advance, stock prices tripled. Automobile production in 1929 was almost precisely double the level of 1922. It was in the twenties that Americans bought their first car, their first radio, made their first long-distance telephone call, took their first out-of-state vacation.

Mises, then, pinpoints the blame for the cycle on inflationary bank credit expansion propelled by the intervention of government and its central bank. What does Mises say should be done, say by government, once the depression arrives? What is the governmental role in the cure of depression? In the first place, government must cease inflating as soon as possible. It is true that this will, inevitably, bring the inflationary boom abruptly to an end, and commence the inevitable recession or depression. But the longer the government waits for this, the worse the necessary readjustments will have to be. The sooner the depression-readjustment is gotten over with, the better. This means, also, that the government must never try to prop up unsound business situations; it must never bail out or lend money to business firms in trouble. Doing this will simply prolong the agony and convert a sharp and quick depression phase into a lingering and chronic disease. The government must never try to prop up wage rates or prices of producers\u2019 goods; doing so will prolong and",
