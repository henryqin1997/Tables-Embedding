The two super studs who defied the aging processes of their eras were Paul Arizin and John Havlicek. Arizin did so at age 30 in his 7th season (1959). Havlicek hit his peak at age 3o, too, in his 9th season (1970)., 58191=Walt Bellamy is the only other player to set a career-high during his rookie season in the go-go season of 1962. Dave Bing, Charlie Scott, Dan Issel, Bob Lanier, Rick Barry, Julius Erving, and Marques Johnson all set their high ppg during their 2nd season., 56576=Scoring Spike: 1962 is often noted as the most statistically ridiculous season in NBA history. The distinction is well-deserved since it\u2019s the year Wilt averaged 50 points and Oscar threw up a triple double average for the season. However, did you notice that in 2006 and 2007 NINE of the 60 players here set their career high in ppg? Something was definitely in the water., 57853=Baby Faces: Spencer Haywood at 20-years old is the youngest player here to set a career high in ppg. His 30 ppg in 1970 were good enough to take home both MVP and ROY for the ABA that season. LeBron James during his 3rd season at age 21 is the only other player to set a career-high under the age of 22.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "% of career ppg: How much larger the high avg. was than the career avg. Age: the age the player at. Year: the year of their playing career ppg peak was reached. Season: the season the player hit their ppg peak. This leaves us with 60 players and the following data: So, the players sampled here are those who averaged at least 20 points per game for their career and also played in at least 500 games in the NBA and/or the ABA. The points per game minimum is my way of singling out the best scorers, even if it does come with flaws. The 500 game limit is to dispose of players whose careers didn\u2019t last long enough to descend from peak play. For this first installment of Paroxysmal Pursuit, I tackle the issue of when NBA players reach their peak in terms of scoring prowess. Now, there\u2019s no way on earth I could peruse each and every single player in league history. Nor would I really want to. I\u2019m not too interested in seeing when Tree Rollins averaged a career high scoring for this exercise. Photo by gareth1953 via Flickr Welcome to the inaugural edition of Paroxysmal Pursuit! In this and subsequent editions, I will let my mind wander the landscape of the NBA, past and present, in order to answer nonsensical, mostly unimportant",
