    "textBeforeTable": "Water quality at nearby bathing waters A heady amount of other activities is also a quick drive of Masterland: Tenby Leisure Centre for swimming and gymming; lobbing balls at the Haverfordwest Tennis Centre and, slightly further afield, the steamingly scenic Teifi Valley Railway \u2013 keep an eye out for the flat wagons lumbering back from the forest laden with wood. Head to Heatherton for treetop adventures, Oakwood for screamingly good rides and Folly Farm for old-fashioned fun at the undercover vintage fair, huge helter-skelter and farmyard animals by the dozen in the Jolly Barn. Also within five miles, any kid worth their salt is going to want a hugely long visit to Tenby\u2019s Dinosaur Park, where they can spot dinos in the woods, walk on water in giant bubbles or throw themselves around the indoor and outdoor play areas and the games garden. Next up for most families \u2013 or first up depending on how insistent the kids are \u2013 are the three Pembrokeshire theme parks within five miles of Masterland: jolly Folly Farm Adventure Park and Zoo, Oakwood Theme Park and Heatherton activity centre, all without eye-watering theme park prices (Heatherton has free admission and \u2018pay as you play\u2019; Oakwood and Folly Farm have discounts for booking online in advance). Coppet Hall, Wisemans Bridge and Amroth beaches are also nearby: Wisemans Bridge is best for energetic canines as it\u2019s dog-friendly all year round (there\u2019s a pub on the seafront too, we\u2019re just saying);",
