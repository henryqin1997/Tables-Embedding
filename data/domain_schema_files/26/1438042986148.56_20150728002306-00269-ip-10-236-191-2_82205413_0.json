It was co-founded by Dave Neary and Dave Odin., 1160=Louis Su\u00e1rez-Potts, OpenOffice.org's Community Development Manager and Community Lead was sent to the LGM 2007 to find ways that OpenOffice.org might be able to transcend the boundaries of a traditional office suite by collaborating with other open source projects. One of the ways that has been suggested was that open office could suggest another open source application when it could not perform the role a user required. For example when a user needed to edit an image in an office document, OpenOffice.org may suggest GIMP to fill the role required.[7], 4440=Held yearly since 2006 the Libre Graphics Meeting aims to attract developers, artists and professionals[2] who use and improve free and open source software graphics applications. LGM aims to bring these people together in the cause of creating high quality free graphics applications;[3] By collaborating it allows the development of cross-application assets like brushes and enhanced interoperability such as shared file formats.[4]}",
