    "textAfterTable": "Notes: Part 3 of 3 in the series -- collect all 3! Edition of 1,000 Mastered by Shawn Hatfield at Audibleoddities Overview: This is the final album in a 3-part series by San Diego's enigmatic Aspects of Physics -- spanning 5 years, 7 members, and countless pieces of individual audio bits and bytes painstakingly pieced together to form the cohesive Marginalized Information Forms series. Whereas part one in the series represented the marriage of electronic and rock sensibilities and part two focused more on their electronic leanings, part three shifts towards the more organic live-rock-band side of the equation. Children of the post-rock age, MIF3 returns Aspects of Physics back to their roots of amp stacks, drum kits, and crowded rock clubs. Taken as a whole, the MIF series runs the gamut from the bleeps and bloops of synths and computers to the distortion and dynamics of guitars and the human condition. For fans of Battles, Tortoise, Slint, Physics, Fridge, Four Tet, Stockhausen, Kraftwerk, Mogwai.
