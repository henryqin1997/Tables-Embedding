            "Restoration is complete and it looks brand new. I have completely stripped the cabinet down to bare wood inside and out, and rebuilt all mechanisms top and bottom. I repainted the interior and Bill Davis clear coated the playfield. I have installed the following NOS items, Side rails, side rail screw nails, cabinet decals, plastic set, coin door, Start button, Launch ball button, Frankenstein, manual, glass, legs, install 4 balls and caution High Voltage stickers. I also added Kerry's scoop weldmont and hole protector and a set of Pinball Pro subwoofer and backbox speakers. Software version 1.06 This game now ROCKS!",

            "My Monster Bash was made in 9/10/98 serial # 52165400699. Interestingly on the back above the serial # it says MonsterBash - Sweden. I guess it was meant to go to Sweden but I don't know if it ever did as I bought it from a pinball dealer here in Pa. I installed the \"Pinball Pro speaker upgrade kit\" for it and it is great! The subwoofer is awesome. I've got it setup with a really easy 5 ball and managed to get 4 monster bashes and 2 monsters of rock in one game for a total score of 1.2 billion. After a year of ownership my family still loves the game! I've got a picture of it with the Monsters of Rock lit at my website at http://vaness.net/monsterbash/VanEssMonsterBash.jpg",

Mosh MB Champ - 63.5M Bash Champ - 157M Rock Champ - 440M Game is set on 3 ball but with \"my\" mods - special and replay set to extra ball, increased ball saver time - hate it when they go away too quick ;-) When I first got it we had it on 5 ball - used to have all my pins that way since I grew up with it, but finally got harrassed into turning it down. Had a great game once - in the 1.8-1.9B range on 5 ball that included Lyman's Lament.",

            "I got it out of a local 'TILT' arcade. I repaired the scoop hole, fixed a broken pop bumper bracket, replaced the flasher on top the scoop hole. It seems the repair mechanics have a habit of just cutting wires or removing broken items at these arcades :-( I have gotten it back to 100% working and all it needs now is cabinet decals. Maybe someday I can justify the $200-250 for decals plus all the time involved but for right now it plays fine the way it is!",
