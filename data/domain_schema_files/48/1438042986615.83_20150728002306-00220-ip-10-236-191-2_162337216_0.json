All rights reserved., 2700=Pitcher of the last little while: I figured just looking at a week wouldn\u2019t be fair. A number on this list \u2014 Drew Pomeranz, Matt Moore, Tyler Skaggs and Martin Perez (boy, it\u2019s been a good stretch for lefties, hasn\u2019t it?) \u2014 have earned promotions recently and pitched well (taking nothing away from Shelby Miller and Jake Odorizzi, who were promoted a little further back). But I\u2019ll give the nod to Tommy John surgery survivor Jarrod Parker. It\u2019s looking the rust has been shaken off at this point. The Diamondbacks prospect has been outstanding lately, looking much\u00a0 more like his old self while Arizona monitors his innings. In his last five starts \u2014 all in July \u2014 he\u2019s given up one earned run or less. He\u2019s given up just 18 hits in his 26 innings this month for a .196 batting average against. After walking 33 batters in 61 first-half innings, he\u2019s given up just 11 free passes in 31 IP since the break., 1615=I know, I know. My last Top 50 update came back on June 13 and I can only offer my humblest apologies. Since that time, the Top 50 list has changed quite a bit, with several players leaving the ranks thanks to their graduation (read: losing rookie status) to the big leagues., 98407=Portions \u00a9 2012 Minor League Baseball., 20662=Again, many promotions throughout the list. But I\u2019ve got to applaud the work of Dee Gordon. Gordon got a call up to Los Angeles and got sent down after 22 games there. Rather than sulk, though, he has flat out raked in Triple-A. In 16 July games, the speedy shortstop has hit .408/.440/.563. That\u2019s 29-for-71 for those of you scoring at home. He\u2019s also gone 8-for-9 in stolen base attempts, making him a nifty 30-for-34 for the year.}",

For now, though, lets work with the 50 we\u2019ve got and give an update on how they\u2019re doing, starting with the pitchers. And there are even more changes in store. The Team Top 10s have already been reshuffled in many instances, with players moving up in ranking due to their impressive performances (Example: Brad Peacock now at No. 2 on the Nationals\u2019 Top 10 list). And while there are many new names on the overall Top 50 to check out (the point I\u2019m trying",
