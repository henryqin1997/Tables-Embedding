    "textAfterTable": "Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: Savages are proficient with all simple weapons, and with bows. They are proficient with leather, studded leather, and hide armor, but not with shields. Animalistic Senses (Ex): At first level, a savage gains the low-light vision and scent abilities, if he did not possess them before. He also gains the Track feat as a bonus feat. Primary Evolution (Ex): At first level, a savage develops a single natural weapon\u0097 claws, fangs, horns, talons, or a tail. This ability functions as an Evolution (see below), but the natural weapon chosen is a primary natural weapon, not a secondary. This choice cannot be changed later. Nature\u0092s Gift (Ex): As he grows in experience, a savage finds his ties to the natural world developing in mysterious ways. At 2nd level, and every subsequent second level, he chooses an ability from the following list. Unless otherwise mentioned, you may not choose an ability more than once. While the exact nature of a Nature's Gift ability is not immediately obvious, there is usually a related physical mutation. For example, a savage who takes the Wild Senses ability might have his eyes and ears alter to look like those of a cat. A savage taking the Gecko's Foot ability might grow pads on the bottom of his hands and feet. The exact form of these mutations are left up",
