An arrow -> indicates ordering: get the items in the left before the ones in the right. The Extension: list is often more for giving interesting possibilities than an actual build order. This is particularly true for item independent heroes and supports. All builds should be adapted to each different game. Good luck and have fun! What does this guide contain? I try to make is so that each guide includes a short description of the hero and his role, generally accepted, cookie cutter, item and skill builds and some important miscellaneous tips and mechanics clarifications. The objective is to allow a player to get enough info to play a reasonable game, while keeping the guides short enough so",
