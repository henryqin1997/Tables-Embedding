    "textBeforeTable": "RT8002/50 is a dual power MOSFET module designed for fast swiching applications of high voltage and current. 2 devices are serial connected. The mounting base of the module is electrically isolated from semiconductor elements for simple heatsink construction. The RT8002 is a monolithic CMOS clock generator IC designed to minimize cost and component count in digital video/audio systems. At the core of the RT8002 is circuitry that implements a voltage-controlled crystal oscillator when an external resonator (nominally 27MHz) is attached. The VCXO al- lows device frequencies to be precisely adjusted for use in systems that have frequency matching requirements, such as digital satellite receivers. Three high-resolution phase-locked loops independently generate three other selectable frequencies derived from the VCXO frequency. These clock frequencies are re- lated to the VCXO frequency and to each other by exact ratios. The locking of all the output frequencies together can eliminate unpredictable artifacts in video systems and unpredictable electromagnetic interference (EMI) performance due to frequency harmonic stacking. Referenced to VCCA Voltage VCC Isolation Feature \u2212 If Either VCC Input Is at GND, Both Ports Are in the High-Impedance State Overvoltage-Tolerant Inputs/Outputs Allow Mixed-Voltage-Mode Data Communications Fully Configurable Dual-Rail Design Allows Each Port to Operate Over the Full 1.2-V to 3.6-V Power-Supply Range Ioff Supports Partial-Power-Down Mode Operation I/Os Are 4.6-V Tolerant Bus Hold on Data Inputs Eliminates the Need for External Pullup/Pulldown Resistors Latch-Up Performance Exceeds 100 mA Per JESD 78, Class II ESD Protection Exceeds JESD 22 \u2212",
