Gross margins of 82% were stronger than expected, leading to earnings per share (EPS) 50% above analysts' predictions. Operating margins came in at 20%, and net margins approached 18%. The company raised its revenue expectations for 2001 based on its acquisition of Internet Auction, Korea's largest auction site, and strong business momentum generally., 9228=Three Stocks for 2001, 16771=High expenditures in Q1 2000 make the trailing free cash flow number considerably lower than it will be next quarter. If eBay merely replicates in Q1 2001 its average free cash flow over the last three quarters, trailing free cash flow will come to $0.30 per share. Let's take a shot at discounting its future cash flow from there., 13941=Who now will challenge eBay in the secondhand market? It has already stared down competition from powerhouses Yahoo!, Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT), and Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN), all of which launched auctions in 1998 or 1999. What more powerful competitors could build a trading community to compete with eBay? (Well, perhaps AOL Time Warner (NYSE: AOL), but it has bigger fish to fry.), 17120=One possible value Management, which is known as conservative in its guidance, said in September that it anticipated $3 billion in revenue by 2005, a 50% annual growth rate. That's ambitious, to be sure. Let's reckon 40% annual free cash flow growth over the next five years, 25% over the following five years, 15% over the next decade, and 7.5% thereafter.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "1/24/01 as of ~8:30:00 PM EST Rule Breaker Portfolio I wonder when Mr. Buffett will join us at shareholder meetings. Jeff Fischer wrote yesterday that eBay was his favorite long-term holding. I second that. More than any other company I own, I think that eBay has a strong, sustainable advantage and huge growth opportunities. I'm with it for the long haul as well. We think that eBay has an enormous market opportunity in collectibles, CDs, books, used cars -- you name it. We think it has a trading platform and community that provides it with many further possible revenue streams. We think that it won't even occur to the next generation of Americans (or Japanese or Britons",
