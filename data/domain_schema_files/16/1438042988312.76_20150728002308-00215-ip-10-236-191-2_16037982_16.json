Hawaii third baseman Vinnie Catricala caught Hawaii-Hilo baserunner Shane Kessel off the bag for an out last night. Hawaii beat UH-Hilo for the 14th straight time, 5-4.

    "textAfterTable": "UH-Hilo starter Clayton Uyechi befuddled the Rainbows lineup for six innings, allowing just two hits and one unearned run while striking out three. Matt Daly, who threw a one-hit shutout in his last outing against the Vulcans, wasn't nearly as impressive, but matched Uyechi on the scoreboard until a solo home run by Higa with two outs in the sixth gave the Vulcans a 2-1 advantage. Higa made it 3-1 in the eighth on an RBI single by A.J. Satele, but that's when the Rainbows offense came to life. Brandon Haislet, who reached base in all five plate appearances, was hit by a pitch with one out in the eighth. Kevin Macdonald then drove him in with a double to right to make it 3-2. \"It was good to come out here and get this first win under our belts,\" Haislet said. \"Hopefully we can build off this performance and come back and get a couple more (wins).\" After Fujii's run sent the game into extra innings, the Vulcans reclaimed the lead in the 10th. Shane Kessel and Thomas Brown reached on infield singles before Higa drilled a ground ball that got past Rainbows shortstop Nathan Young, which scored Kessel to make it 4-3. Peter Rodgers had a chance to break the game open, but grounded out with the bases loaded to end the threat. Hawaii once again answered as Haislet scored on a sacrifice",
