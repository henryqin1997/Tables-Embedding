    "textBeforeTable": "PURDUE'S 2014 SIGNING CLASS \"What will help the team in the future is how close we'll be and how everyone wants each other to do better.\" \"The best part was just hanging out with the guys,\" said Thompson, who is considering majors but wants to someday own his own business. \"I feel I'll definitely fit in. We've already made a bond. Thompson's new team was at the front of his mind on the eve of signing day, as he reflected on his official visit last weekend. \"He's a team guy, and that's something you always look for in any player, let alone a point guard.\" \"A point guard makes other people better, and we think he's going to do that for us,\" said Painter, who called signing Thompson \"a steal.\" Thompson, whose father, LaSalle played at Ball State and Indiana State before a professional career overseas, averaged 23.6 points in addition to running the point for the Braves. He recently was named to the Indiana All-Star team. Painter said last season's inconsistent point guard play motivated Purdue's coaches to keep pursuing Thompson. But he also likes Thompson's all-around game. \"With me spreading the floor and being able to shoot and make good decisions, and with Bryson's aggressiveness and determination to get where he wants to go ... we bring two different things to the table, but we can go well with each other,\" Thompson said. Thompson joins current freshman Bryson Scott as the only point guards on scholarship",
