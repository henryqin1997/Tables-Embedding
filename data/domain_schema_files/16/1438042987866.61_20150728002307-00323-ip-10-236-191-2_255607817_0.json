    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{31693=Brechnitz worked for Edward Jones in St. Louis, his hometown, after college. He later moved to Decatur and opened his own brokerage firm, which was bought by a predecessor of Wachovia Securities. He joined Morgan Stanley in 1994, just before finishing up a six-year term as mayor of Decatur, and this past May all six partners in The Brechnitz Group joined Raymond James & Associates., 45000=Prior to joining Merrill, she worked as an investment banker at Bankers Trust. When Bankers was bought by Deutsche Bank in 1998, she headed to Merrill because of its \u201cstrong retail roots\u201d and full-service platform. Her extensive background in investment banking and derivatives has given her an added edge over other advisors, she says. It enables her to employ active option-trading strategies and currency overlays in 80 percent of the accounts, either as a hedge or to generate alpha., 40803=It shouldn't come as a surprise that Stern is such a student of history. He's 67 and has been in the business for 47 years \u2014 and though he does business in 34 states, he lives and works in the same town where he was born and raised, Vineland, N.J. He started out in 1959 at Bache & Company, calling people he knew in town, and then asking them for referrals. (Bache & Company, of course, has been devoured a few times over and is now a part of Wachovia). But, he says, \u201cI probably haven't asked for a referral in 25 years \u2014 the business just comes because of good people who are happy with me.\u201d, 37890=His reputation grew as a reliable source, and he began getting requests from companies, like Pepsi and Sears, to offer advice to its employees. After 25 years of doing it his way, Magnesen has $1.3 billion in assets under management and over 2,000 clients. By his fifth year in the business, Magnesen had $100 million in assets and went on to receive Registered Rep.'s Outstanding Broker Award in 1989. Needless to say, things seemed to have gone OK without the cold calls., 39414=But his educating doesn't stop with clients and students. By 1990, his business was growing and he needed an extra hand. \u201cI hired my 57-year-old father, a retired college professor, and put him through a lot of training,\u201d he says. And another generation of educators is on its way to the Oak Brook office as well. Magnesen is already predicting which one of his four sons will be coming to work for him. \u2014 HT, 46071=Taking care of her children, however, is her biggest responsibility, she says. In July, she gave birth to a baby boy, Jack, and she also has a three-year-old daughter, Madison. Balancing work and family is not easy, but her goal \u201cis to be successful at two careers.\u201d It appears she is already hitting the mark. \u2014 Kevin Burke, 20565=When President Gerald Ford signed the Pension Reform Act of 1974 into law \u2014 better known as ERISA \u2014 he made Tetsu Tanimoto's professional life a little easier. Tanimoto was about six years in the advisory game at the time and was looking for a way to stay ahead of the competition. The reform, which established requirements and standards for private pension plans, provided Tanimoto with a new group of possible clients whose retirement money was now being protected by the federal government. \u201cI bought the book and read about ERISA and said, \u2018Wow, this stuff is really important.\u2019 That's when I started making these accounts part of my business,\u201d Tanimoto recalls., 26267=John Fitzpatrick, an advisor with UBS in New York who specializes in high-net-worth families, says he recalls having to go back and redesign his clients' plans after realizing \u201cthat something was missing.\u201d He says estate planning was not talked about when he began practicing in 1985. But, he learned in the early 1990s how important estate planning was, so he had to go back to his clients and integrate estate planning into their plans. Specialization is a learning process, he says. For him \u201cit was a trial-and-error process but, over time, I think we broke the code of what our clients need to have.\u201d, 34771=Kelley wasn't an investing neophyte when he decided to join the money game full time. Since his small manufacturing business threw off enough income to support his family, he was able to invest his wife's teaching salary in the market. The thing was: He generated better returns than a friend who was a stockbroker. Not long after, he gave up his small business and took a job with the St. Louis-based regional firm G.H. Walker & Company. After its acquirer (White, Weld & Co.) was bought out by Merrill Lynch in 1978, Kelley jumped to another regional firm in an attempt to keep his practice away from a large wirehouse. And when his new firm was bought by Paine Webber a year later, Kelley was again forced to change firms, but this time it was for good. \u201cDain has been terrific. Even since we've been sold to RBC, the firm feels the same. I think it's just easier to talk to the home office when you're with a smaller firm,\u201d he says.}",

She later went on to become a three-time all-American at USC, where she played on two NCAA championship teams. After college, she spent five years on the pro tour and played against tennis legend Martina Navratilova. Prior to joining Merrill, she worked as an investment banker at Bankers Trust.
