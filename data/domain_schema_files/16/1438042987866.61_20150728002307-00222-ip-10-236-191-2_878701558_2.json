He holds an A.B. in mathematics, summa cum laude from Harvard College (1962), and a J.D., magna cum laude from Harvard Law School (1966), where he was a member of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau. Tribe won the intercollegiate National Debate Tournament in 1961 and coached the Harvard debating team to another national championship in 1969.[citation needed], 21499=Tribe married Carolyn Ricarda Kreye in 1964. The couple have two children, Mark and Kerry, both visual artists.[citation needed], 13163=In 2014, Tribe was retained to represent Peabody Energy, the nation's largest coal producer in a suit against the Environmental Protection Agency. Tribe argued that EPA's use of the Clean Air Act to implement its Clean Power Plan was unconstitutional.[17] Tribe's legal analysis has been criticized by other legal commentators, including fellow Harvard Law School professors Richard J. Lazarus and Jody Freeman (who described his conclusion as \"wholly without merit\"),[18][19] as well as by Georgetown University Law Center professor Lisa Heinzerling, and current director of the American Law Institute and former dean of New York University School of Law Richard Revesz.[citation needed], 9125=The Supreme Court ruled against Tribe's client in Bowers v. Hardwick in 1986 and held that a Georgia state law criminalizing sodomy, as applied to consensual acts between persons of the same sex, did not violate fundamental liberties under the principle of substantive due process. However, in 2003 the Supreme Court overruled Bowers in Lawrence v. Texas, a case for which Tribe wrote the ACLU's amicus curiae brief supporting Lawrence, who was represented by Lambda Legal., 15926=Tribe is noted for his extensive support of liberal legal causes. He is one of the co-founders of the liberal American Constitution Society, the law and policy organization formed to counter the conservative Federalist Society, and is one of a number of scholars at Harvard Law School who have expressed their support for animal rights.[22] Tribe unsuccessfully argued one case for Al Gore during the disputed 2000 U.S. presidential election., 2157=Laurence Henry Tribe (born October 10, 1941) is a professor of constitutional law at Harvard Law School and the Carl M. Loeb University Professor at Harvard University. He also works with the firm Massey & Gail LLP on a variety of matters.[3], 7991=Tribe served as a law clerk to Mathew Tobriner on the California Supreme Court from 1966\u201367 and as a law clerk to Potter Stewart of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1967\u201368. He joined the Harvard Law School faculty as an assistant professor in 1968, receiving tenure in 1972. Among his distinguished law students and research assistants while on the faculty at Harvard have been Barack Obama (a research assistant for two years), Chief Justice John Roberts (as a law student in his classes), and Elena Kagan (as a research assistant).[9], 10036=In 2004, Tribe acknowledged having plagiarized several specific phrases and a sentence in his 1985 book, God Save this Honorable Court, to a 1974 book by Henry Abraham.[10][11] After an investigation, Tribe was reprimanded by Harvard for \"a significant lapse in proper academic practice\" but concluded that Tribe's error was unintentional.[12], 10765=On May 22, 2013, he was presented with an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Columbia University during its Class of 2013 commencement.[13], 11378=Tribe has represented industry clients in several notable environmental cases. In 2000, Tribe wrote an amicus brief on behalf of General Electric in Whitman v. American Trucking, in which he argued that the Clean Air Act's National Ambient Air Quality Standards program was unconstitutional under the nondelegation doctrine.[14] The Supreme Court unanimously rejected this challenge, with Justice Scalia writing the Court's opinion upholding the program.[15], 17614=Alongside Harvard's Cass Sunstein, Tribe served as a judicial adviser to the Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.[24] In February 2010, he was named \"Senior Counselor for Access to Justice\" in the Department of Justice.[5][25] He resigned eight months later, claiming health reasons.[26]}",

The couple have two children, Mark and Kerry, both visual artists.[citation needed] Personal life[edit] \"[P]rincipally to highlight the extraordinary character of this particularly vitriolic and internally inconsistent dissent ... about how the Court should have decided the very controversy that he says wasn't really before it ... [For Scalia to] accuse the majority of arrogance and then reach the merits after saying that the Court lacks jurisdiction to address the case requires no small dose of chutzpah ... Scalia didn't so much as consider the possibility ... that considerations of federalism might point to a particularly rigorous examination of the purported justifications for a measure like Section 3. ... In predicting that the opinion joined by the five Justices comprising today's Windsor majority would invariably lead to the invalidation of state efforts to limit lawful marriage to opposite-sex couples, Justice Scalia was engaging in a bait-and-switch unworthy of so serious and smart a jurist, one who often displays a principled side",
