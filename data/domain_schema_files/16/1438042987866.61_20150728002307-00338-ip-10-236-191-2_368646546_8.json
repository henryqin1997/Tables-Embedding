    "textBeforeTable": "Part Number Status for Zero Gravity Double Bubble Windscreens - Suzuki GSXR750 - 1996-10 I was looking for more wind protection for my 2013 GSXR 750. It does an excellent job and even made bike easier to ride at speed. It looks good as well. The only problem is it came with a warning label that said it could possibly melt the instrument cluster if left parked outside on a hot day. I have ridden on a hot day but as of yet have not wanted to leave it parked in the sun for a long period of time. Cons: Warning label said could melt insterment cluster on a hot day Pros: Excellent wind protection Recommended by Reviewer: Yes TX Fred Martinez \u00a0 Double Bubble 2013 GSXR 750 - This review is for Zero Gravity Double Bubble Windscreens - Suzuki GSXR600-750 - 2011-13 Hopefully they can help you find the right item and make the best buying decision.
