    "textAfterTable": "\"Soft money\" donations have no limit, but may not be used on behalf of federal candidates. In contrast, regular \"hard money\" contributions can go directly to federal candidates or be used on their behalf, but are limited and regulated by the FEC. The other difference between hard and soft money is that soft money contributions can be made directly from corporate or union treasuries - something that's prohibited when money is given directly to candidates. Totals listed here include all contributions made by the organization itself, its political action committee (if it has one), and its employees, officers and members of their immediate families. Totals are based on contributions received by the Federal Election Commission on December 31, 1969.
