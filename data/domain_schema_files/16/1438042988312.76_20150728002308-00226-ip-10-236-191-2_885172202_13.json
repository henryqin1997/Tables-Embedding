[1], 18986=Fans gathered at Fenway Park on February 8, 2011 in order to kick off the Red Sox preseason by celebrating Truck Day. The first full team workout of the preseason took place on February 19.[8] Playing other teams in the Grapefruit League the Red Sox finished with 14 wins and 19 losses.[9], 20018=The Red Sox made a statement in the offseason, letting everyone know that after missing the playoffs last year, they are striving to win the World Series this year, but instead imploded in dramatic fashion in September and failed to make the playoffs. During the offseason the Red Sox traded for first baseman Adrian Gonzalez,[10] and they followed that move up by signing star outfielder Carl Crawford.[11], 23907=The Red Sox became the first team in the history of Major League Baseball to have a nine-game lead in September and fail to make the playoffs that season, thanks to their 7-20 record in the final month of the regular season.[12] In the days following this historic collapse, the front office and manager Terry Francona decided to part ways, and not exercise either of the additional year options on Francona's contract., 21138=The Red Sox kicked off the year against the defending AL Pennant Winners, the Texas Rangers in Arlington, Texas on Friday, April 1. The Red Sox home opener was Friday, April 8 against the rival New York Yankees., 22010=On May 15, John Lackey and Daisuke Matsuzaka were placed on the disabled list. On June 10, Matsuzaka underwent season-ending Tommy John Surgery. Clay Buchholz was afflicted with what would be diagnosed as a stress fracture in his back and was also put on the disabled list on June 17, where he would remain for the rest of the season. Other pitchers including Rich Hill and Jenks spent significant time on the disabled list. The Red Sox obtained \u00c9rik B\u00e9dard from the Seattle Mariners seconds before the trading deadline, after Kyle Weiland (who was highlighted by his ejection on his MLB debut) proved ineffective. Starting Pitcher John Lackey and ace Jon Lester were ineffective down the stretch, as the Red Sox crashed down to a 7-20 finish, blowing a 9-game wild card lead that they held entering September. Josh Beckett missed a start early in the month after spraining his ankle in a previous start, and was ineffective in most of his September starts after that point., 4732=The Boston Red Sox 2011 season was the 111th in the team's history. The Red Sox opened their 2011 season in Arlington, Texas, playing the Rangers. Breaking from the traditional opening day of Sunday or Monday, Major League Baseball's 2011 season began on a Thursday, March 31, with the Red Sox playing the next day. The Red Sox were favored to win the AL East and reach the World Series in the offseason, with some comparing the team to the 1927 New York Yankees.[4][5][6] After leading the Tampa Bay Rays by nine games in the AL wild card race on September 3\u2014when their odds of reaching the playoffs peaked at 99.6%\u2014the Red Sox lost 18 of their final 24 games.[7] On the last day of the season, September 28, 2011, a Boston bottom of the 9th blown save loss against the Baltimore Orioles coupled (mere minutes later) with an extra inning come from behind Tampa Bay Rays victory made the Rays the American League Wild Card winners, eliminating Boston from playoff contention.}",
