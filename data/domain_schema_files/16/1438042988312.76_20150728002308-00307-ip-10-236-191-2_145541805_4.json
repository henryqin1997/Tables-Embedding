The Yankees' cross-town rival fared much better in the draft. The Mets had three first round selections and picked Darryl Strawberry (number one overall), Billy Beane and John Gibbons with those picks. Three years later, Strawberry was the National League's Rookie of the Year. The 1980 June draft was marked by controversy. The Yankees had to forfeit their selection of Billy Cannon, Jr. after Commissioner Bowie Kuhn ruled that the club was guilty of tampering. Other major league clubs accused Cannon's father, former Heisman Trophy winner and NFL star Billy Sr., who had written 25 teams explaining that his son had planned to attend college and there was no reason to waste a draft pick on him. Those clubs agreed and when it came time for the Yankees to pick in the third round, Cannon, who under normal circumstances would have been a first round selection, was available. After the selection was ruled void, Cannon chose to attend Texas A&M and was later a draft pick of the Dallas Cowboys. 1980 1965-69 \u00a0|\u00a0 1970-79 \u00a0|\u00a0 1980-89 \u00a0|\u00a0 1990-99 \u00a0|\u00a0 2000-09 \u00a0|\u00a0 2010s Draft Report: 1980s Draft History home \u00bb First-Year Player Draft History",
    "textAfterTable": "1981 The 1981 draft illustrated a shift from the drafting of high school players to collegiate players. Of the first 50 players selected in June, 34 were from college programs, more than double the previous highest total. Seventeen first round picks were from colleges. The previous high was nine in 1979 and 1980. It was also the first draft in which college players went 1-2, as the Mariners selected Oral Roberts pitcher Mike Moore and the Cubs followed with Wichita State outfielder Joe Carter. Other prominent picks in the June draft included Kevin McReynolds and Tony Gwynn (San Diego), Ron Darling (Texas), Dick Schofield (California), Frank Viola (Minnesota), Mike Pagliarulo (New York Yankees), Phil Bradley (Seattle) and Sid Fernandez (Los Angeles). The Astros selected Glenn Davis in the secondary phase of the January draft. The Yankees chose John Elway, who did not play in the Yankee farm system in 1981, but signed a contract that allowed him to play minor league ball for New York in 1982. After a few games with Oneonta in 1982, Elway decided to pursue a career in football. First Round - June, Regular Phase \u00a0Pick Team Player Position College/Hometown 1.
