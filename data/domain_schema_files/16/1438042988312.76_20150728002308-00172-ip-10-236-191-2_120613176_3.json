Hector presented the system at the ETH in Switzerland, in Mexico, and at a government meeting. Sean presented our paper at CHI 2008, and Andreas briefly discussed PhotoSpread at MIT. Eric also found interest for the software in the Biology community. A video of PhotoSpread is available on YouTube., 2505=Our paper \"EcoPod: a mobile tool for community based biodiversity collection building\" won the Best Student paper award at the 2006 6th ACM/IEEE-CS joint conference on Digital Libraries. The paper's authors are YuanYuan Yu, Jeannie A. Stamberger, Aswath Manoharan, and Andreas Paepcke. We describe a handheld tool for identifying plants and animals in the field. The tool attempts to minimize the number of interactions required to reach a conclusion., 5580=Stanford University's Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve is a 1,200 acre area in the foothills of the Santa Cruz mountains, just outside the Stanford campus. The area has been a Preserve for the past 30 years, but scientists have studied the region since 1891. Since 1928 aerial photographs have been shot. Starting with 1994 aerials were taken every year and were geo-rectified. Efforts are under way to reach back and geo-rectify at least one of the earlier aerials per decade. This collection is joined by a large number of ground level photos and collected specimens. Biologists at the Preserve record changes in the local climate, and have studied the relationship between biodiversity and the intensity and type of neighboring urban development. Many of the Jasper Ridge studies involve long-term experiments. For example, the Preserve gave researchers an opportunity to observe over multiple years an invasion of Argentine ants and its effect on native ant communities [21, 40]. Ant colonies were mapped and their distributions recorded as the invading species progressed. This research was successful in itself. An important capability, however, is missing that might expand this work further. The biologists cannot easily take advantage of already existing data. For example, the aerial photographs might reveal other changes that took place over the course of the study in the areas surrounding the colonies. It is not possible to quickly retrieve the relevant portions of that valuable photo collection. Similarly, a number of other projects in this well-surveyed stretch of land have been producing data that might well impact the Argentine ant study. Underground humidity measures that are collected for other reasons over selected plots in the area, for example, might coincidentally be of interest to the ant invasion researchers.\u00a0, 19947=Annual report 2006/07., 7491=In contrast to the locally focused Jasper Ridge Preserve, the charter of the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco is more broadly to gather and maintain collections that document biodiversity around the globe, and to educate students and the public about all aspects of natural history. The Academy organizes expeditions to all parts of the world. Participating scientists collect data on plants and animals, and return with specimens and large collections of photographs. This material is prepared, preserved, and maintained in permanent collections back in San Francisco. Identifying and cataloging the volume of material being collected still poses a tremendous challenge to Academy staff, while the diversity of data being gathered is also increasing. Beyond research in biodiversity the Academy helps raise sensitivity to ecological considerations abroad. Academy herpetologists have, for example, worked with colleagues in Myanmar to establish a biodiversity museum. Academy botanists and entomologists are establishing a field station in Madagascar to help study and preserve the long-isolated and now extremely threatened biota of that ancient island. \u00a0, 19813=Annual report 2004/05., 19880=Annual report 2005/06.}",
