The following chart illustrates its usages and similarities[3]: edit Comparison of WiFi frequencies Another problem with Wifi is that its status as a limitless yet valuable resource had led to the advent of douchey guys who go to StarFucks in turtlenecks with their macbooks and drink a tiny $7 coffee while consuming enough wifi to cover the entire country of Africa. There are several inherent problems with using WIFI, especially in small buildings such as that as the family home. Scientists discovered that when no one is using the internet within the wifi area (also known as the 'hot zone') the internet has to spill into somewhere. This is usually out the chimney in most home, however, for those that do not have this convenience windows must be opened to prevent wifi build up. Wifi build up can cause cancer, as found out by Dr. Grog of the University of Southampton. Other problems with wifi are corners, where wifi internet can easily get caught. This problem can easily be solved, and if you find that your internet is slow, a gently waving motion toward the computer can speed the connection up. Newer houses in the UK are made without corners, and instead have rounded edges. edit The Problems with Wifi Since then, the reception of",

Its protocol can be easily adapted to the latest trends without the need of developing an entire new system. WiFi has been extended to refrigerators that automatically receive RSS foods, universal remotes that are even more universal, and to shirts with built-in WiFi music systems. Recently, WiFi was developed for Cell phones. This allowed people to carry their own cell phones without a long cord. Typically before the use of WiFI, cell phone usage was limited to the length of the phone cord. Any use beyond the length required roaming charges or an upgrade",
