    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{98177=The high point of Dean\u2019s time with the Cubs was undoubtedly their pennant-winning season of 1938. Dean allowed a run over 8 innings on Sep 27th as the Cubs won 2-1 in the first game of a series with the Pirates,\u00a0pulling within a half-game of the front-running Bucs. Dean called it the greatest game he ever pitched, not because of his stuff but because he had no stuff and still managed to gut out a win. The Cubs swept that series and cruised to the pennant as Pittsburgh collapsed to a 1-6 finish. Despite that pennant, the Cubs gamble on Dean was likely a loss leader, if only for the cash involved., 335673=Unlike the Cubs in the Dean trade, the White Sox did not make a large gamble on a turnaround by Score. Barry Latman was a 24 year-old prospect who had shown\u00a0a bit of\u00a0promise in 1959, his first full season, with 101 ERA+ in 156 IP as a swingman. But, Latman failed to progress, compiling 89 ERA+ in\u00a0652 IP in 4 seasons with Cleveland.\u00a0, 97686=The Cardinals, evidently, were worried enough to entertain offers for Dean, and they got a good one from the Cubs. The $185,000 was a vast sum in 1938, and getting Curt Davis (#12 on the 5-year WAR list, in only 3 seasons of action) in the deal was gravy. In his 3 years in Chicago, Dean was a competent pitcher (16-8, 116 ERA+, 1.23 WHIP), but in only 226 IP as a part-time starter and with just\u00a02.7 K/9. A positive contributor, but nothing like the former Dizzy Dean., 228282=\u00a0The Cardinals also got some value from the other players in the deal. Clyde Shoun was a reliver and occasional starter, contributing almost 500 innings over 4 seasons at a journeyman level 95 ERA+. Shoun would continue to provide that type of performance for various teams until 1949. Tuck Stainback was a different story. A reserve outfielder, his -7.3 career WAR is tied for the 6th lowest total since 1901 (min. 2300 PA). But, in a\u00a0wartime environment, that was good enough to hang on until 1946.\u00a0, 98801=For the Cardinals, the promise Curt Davis showed in his first 3 seasons was not sustained. After 3 seasons over 200 IP, Davis would exceed that threshold only twice more in his career. Nevertheless, he did compile decent career numbers for a player who started as a 30 year-old rookie. Here are the pitchers since 1901 to compile 30 to 36 WAR from age 30 onwards. Not bad company. The rank shows their WAR placement among all pitchers in this period., 335319=In Chicago, Score cut his 1959 HR/9 in half in 1960 leading to an improved 102 ERA+.\u00a0But, his K/9 started to slide which, combined with continuing control problems\u00a0that Score had always struggled with, led to just a 0.90 K/BB ratio. Score was\u00a0to contribute just 30 more innings in his final two seasons with the Sox.\u00a0, 340773=During McDowell\u2019s 4 seasons with at least 33 starts for Chicago, he compiled a gaudy 73-39 record but did so with only a 117 ERA+. More ominously, his K/9\u00a0declined every year, bottoming out at just 5.5 for the 1993 season. Things started evening out in 1994 when McDowell went only 10-9 despite leading the league with 3.2 K/BB. In New York, McDowell\u2019s walks and\u00a0HR started creeping up, leading to a 15-10 mark and 118 ERA+. A middle finger salute to jeering fans upon being removed from a game would seal his fate as\u00a0just a one-year\u00a0Yankee. McDowell would have one more season as a regular starter, with Cleveland\u00a0in 1996, before winding up his career with an 87 ERA+ in just 135 innings over his final 3 seasons., 340433=This trade had actually occurred the previous December but was just completed at this time when the Yankees sent Lyle Mouton to the White Sox as the PTBNL.\u00a0The Yankees were no doubt expecting\u00a0 big things from\u00a0former Cy Young winner McDowell, though a closer look at his record might have given them pause., 96677=Dean\u2019s dominance continued into the 1937 season. At the All-Star break, Dean was 12-7 in 149 IP, with 14 CG and 4 SHO, a 2.41 ERA (NL avg ERA was 3.91) and 110 SO against only 22 BB. Of course, in that year\u2019s All-Star game, Dean suffered a broken toe on a ball hit back through the box by the Indians\u2019 Earl Averill., 351629=Interesting to see the younger Dean in the table regarding the Score trade. That was about the extent of Paul\u2019s career as he was injured the next spring. I also found it interesting that as a batter his career took a turn after the first two seasons \u2013 a 7 OPS+ for 1934-35 and -48 for the remainder of his career., 334680=Score was hit in the\u00a0eye with a batted ball, a line drive back through the box,\u00a0early in the 1957 season. He was hospitalized for 3 weeks and was still suffering from vision problems at the end of the season. Nevertheless, Score returned to start the 1958 season and\u00a0looked to be regaining his form when he was\u00a0sidelined\u00a0with a torn tendon in his elbow, an injury that recurred soon after his return\u00a0in June so that Score managed only 41 innings for the season. Score pitched a full season in 1959 but was prone to the gopher ball, leading to just a 79 ERA+, despite a league-leading 8.2 K/9.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "\u00a0 Dizzy Dean was unquestionably among the\u00a0premier pitchers of his era. For his first 5 seasons, Dean led the majors in wins and strikeouts, and placed 3rd in WAR, more than 5 WAR ahead of 4th place Lon Warneke. Here\u2019s the WAR list for those 5 seasons,\u00a01932 to 1936. \u00a0 April 16, 1938 \u2013 The Chicago Cubs traded Curt Davis, Clyde Shoun, Tuck Stainback and $185,000 to the St. Louis Cardinals for Dizzy Dean. \u00a0 After the jump,\u00a0I\u2019ll look at these trades more closely and consider the wisdom of the moves. \u00a0 This week (April 16-22) saw a couple of trades\u00a0with similar circumstances. In both instances, a team traded for a player who had been an outstanding performer, but whose performance had declined\u00a0after returning from an injury.
