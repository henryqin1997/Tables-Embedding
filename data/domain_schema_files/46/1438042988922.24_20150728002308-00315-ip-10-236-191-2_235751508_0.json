    "textBeforeTable": "Jeter inches toward history in every at-bat. Offensive Analysis: If the fielders actually caught the balls, the Yankees offense would have been enough. They scored 8 runs on 13 hits. Jeter got 3 more hits, Melky had a 3-run homer after colliding with Johnny in the outfield, which sent me into hysterics. I was worried about them. But\u00a0they were okay, as\u00a0Melky showed with his homer. The Yankees\u00a0were hitting, they just lost for other reasons, ahem,,,catch the\u00a0ball, ahem\u2026They didn\u2019t look dead at the plate like they do in many of their loses. Defensive Analysis: This is not an exaggeration: Yesterday\u2019s game was the worst defensively played game I have ever seen in my young life.\u00a04 errors, 700 misplays, it was disgusting. Jerry made an error, Cano made an error, Swisher lost a ball in the sun, Tex totally missed a grounder, Mitre struckout Encarnacion who reached first on the wild pitch, Hairston paused with the ball and got no one out, Melky and Damon collided,\u00a0bloopers were dropping in in front of everyone, it was gross. Poor Sergio. My\u00a0poor baby. They were forcing\u00a0him to",
    "textAfterTable": "\u00a0 The only bright spots about the game for me were that, well first of all I got to stare\u00a0open-mouthed at Sergio Mitre, which is a treat I will take any day. Melky had a\u00a03-run homer after colliding with\u00a0Damon, so he is okay.\u00a0And I actually\u00a0got to see my Cervelli again!!! He caught at the end of the game. Boy,\u00a0did I miss him. Everything about him is\u00a0cute. I was glad to see him play.\u00a0Hopefully\u00a0he will catch at least 1 game in the doubleheader today. I will be\u00a0very upset if he doesn\u2019t. The Smelly Sox won yesterday, so our lead\u00a0is back to 7.5 games. But hopefully we can increase that lead today. I guess they all just had a\u00a0bad day on the field. It happens, but to the Yankees? No. But yes.\u00a0They are just human. We have just been spoiled with perfectly played games all year long. I guess they can\u00a0mess up once in awhile. ONCE IN AWHILE, boys, that was the \u201conce\u201d and the rest of the season is the \u201cawhile.\u201d So\u00a0be perfect\u00a0for the rest of the year, okay? Hahaha. I still love you guys. Especially you, Sergio.\u00a0love\u00a0you. ;) GO YANKEES!!! **Note** I was so caught up in my frustration over the game that I forgot something: I would just like to thank everyone for making me #11 on the Latest Leader\u2019s list. I can\u2019t believe I was even on it, not to mention that high up on my first time. It really",
