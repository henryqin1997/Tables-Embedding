He probably needs about half a season at double-A before moving up to triple-A and could be ready for the Majors by the end of the season. Chicago tends to be overly aggressive with some of its pitchers so I wouldn\u2019t be shocked to see Molina in triple-A to begin 2012., 15269=DISCLAIMER: This is very limited in telling us much about how 2012 will play out for a large number of reasons., 18061=YEAR IN REVIEW: When his breaking ball improved to the point where the Jays organization felt it could be at least MLB average, Molina was moved into the starting rotation for good in 2011. He had a breakout season and reached double-A. The 22-year-old hurler spent the majority of the season in high-A where he posted a 2.45 FIP (2.58 ERA) in 108.1 innings. He showed his outstanding control by posting a walk rate of 1.16 BB/9. Molina also sent a large number of batters back to the dugout shaking their heads (9.55 K/9)., 17062=CAREER OUTLOOK: Molina has the makings of a No. 3 starter at the MLB level. The big question for him is his durability. Originally an outfielder, he was moved to the bump permanently in 2008 and has pitched more than 100 innings just once (2011). There is also some concern over his delivery and that, unless it gets smoothed out, he\u2019ll be a high-leverage reliever at the MLB level., 18900=BORN: Jan. 9, 1989 EXPERIENCE: 5 seasons ACQUIRED: 2006 non-drafted free agent (Toronto) 2010-11 TOP 10 RANKING: Off}",
