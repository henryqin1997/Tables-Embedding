Student-athletes must possess a 3.0 cumulative GPA, have completed one full academic year the nominating institution and participated in at least 50 percent of the team's competition to qualify for the all-academic squad. The duo helped lead the team to its most successful season in school history and a second-place finish in the league. The Islanders also advanced to the Southland Conference Tournament finals for the first time in school history before falling by a 4-1 final against Northwestern State. During the year, Matuszak teamed with Maider Martin to earn First Team All-Southland in doubles, becoming the first doubles team from the program to ever earn first team honors. They finished 14-3 overall, including a 9-0 mark in Southland Conference matches. In addition to her on-court endeavors, Matuszak holds a 3.24 GPA in mechanical engineering, and has been a part of the academic success for the tennis teams at the University. A three-year player from Katy, Matuszak earned First Team All-Southland recognition during the season, and followed up with all-academic honors for the second straight season. She was named to the second team a year ago, and is one of only two",
