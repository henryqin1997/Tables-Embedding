A5-3500 is a triple core processor with 320 Radeon cores, the same as the discrete Radeon HD 5550. The processor frequency is low (2.1GHz) and the power consumption is low (max 65W). A6-3650 is quad-core with the same graphics as A6-3500. TDP 100W looks pretty high, but it operates at voltage 1.250V with no problem, with much lower TDP. A8-3850 has 400 Radeon cores. Configuration I used: - APU: A4-3400, A6-3500, A6-3650, A8-3850 - Memory: DDR3-1600 2 x 2GB. Memory is used as a system memory as well as video memory. You can use DDR3-1866, but the difference is very small in video playback. - A75 chipset mb - OS: Windows 7 x64 SP1 - Driver: 12.1. In CCC > Video, all video post-processors are disabled except for the following three: + Color > Advanced Video Color > Dynamic Range: Limited (16-235) + Quality > Use automatic deinterlacing + Quality > Pulldown detection - Player: MPC HomeCinema - Video decoder: LAV Video Decoder 0.45 (the latest is 0.46). This version implemented DXVA2 (copy-back) support. I also used ffmpeg decoder of LAV Video Decoder. - Deinterlacer: DXVA2 deinterlacing via madVR (the default setting) - Video Renderer: madVR 0.80, in the full-screen exclusive mode, with one of the following quality settings: + medium: Bilinear/Bicubic 50/Bicubic 50 + high*: SoftCubic (softness: 100)/Lanczos (3 taps)/Lanczos (3 taps) + high: SoftCubic (softness: 100)/Lanczos (4 taps)/Lanczos (4 taps) Clips There are five major video formats in NTSC countries:, 132977=I used the following clip for each of them: - SD film: Ratatouille (2007) (480i60, MPEG-2, AC3) - SD video: Die Zauberflote (2003) (480i60, MPEG-2, AC3) - HD film: Iron Man (2008) (1080p24, AVC, TrueHD/AC3) - HD i video: La Traviata (2010) (1080i60, AVC, DTS-HD MA) - HD i video (VC-1): Life - Plants (2010) (1080i60, VC-1, DTS-HD HRA) - HD p video: La Traviata (2010) (1080p60, AVC, DTS-HD MA) Edit: All moved here. I added HD i video (VC-1) because 1080i60 VC-1, although rare, is often hard to play back using FOSS codecs or Windows built-in codec. The desktop refresh rate used is: - 23Hz for film - 59Hz for video Results I measured during the playback of each clip: - Number of dropped frames (\"DF\"; shown in the screen when pressing Ctrl+J). This should be 0, of course. - Average CPU usage (\"CPU\"; I used Performance Monitor built in Windows). Higher CPU usage may result in dropped frames. - Average GPU usage (\"GPU\"; I used GPU-Z and Excel to calculate average). Higher GPU usage may result in dropped frames. - Average rendering time (\"RT\"; shown in the screen when pressing Ctrl+J). This should be well lower than 41.708 ms for film and 16.683 ms for video. Here is a summary:, 135378=Conclusion DXVA2 (copy-back) can't handle HD p video = 60fps contents well (as sated in the release note). Somehow there are occasional dropped frames with ffmpeg decoder implemented in LAV Video Decoder. Using ffdshow Video Decoder (also ffmepg) fixes the problem, but that requires A6-3650 or higher (as decoding AVC at 60fps is pretty CPU-intensive). The only major source of HD p video is commercial camcorder right now anyway and perhaps you will use Media Foundation in WMC to play them back. Any Llano APU can handle HD p video pretty easily under DXVA2/EVR. As for the formats found in DVD and BD (all except for HD p video), A4-3400 can handle medium quality with DXVA2 (copy-back) pretty easily. All APUs, A6-3500 and higher, can handle high quality setting with either DXVA2 (copy-back) or ffmpeg. (ffmpeg does not support interlaced VC-1 yet.) My recommendation goes to: - A6-3500, $75, that can handle all video formats in DVD, BD and broadcast smoothly at madVR's highest quality settings. It also supports HD p video (= 1080p60 AVC) and BR 3D excellently under DXVA2/EVR. - A6-3650, $110, or higher. If you think the triple core at 2.1GHz of A6-3500 is weak, any of A6-3650 and higher is recommended. GPU-intensive AMD's own video post-processors (notably Mosquito Noise Reduction and De-blocking) will work only in these models (if you are interested).}",
