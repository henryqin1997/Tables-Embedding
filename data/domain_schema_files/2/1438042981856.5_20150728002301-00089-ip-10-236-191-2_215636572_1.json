The values of these inputs are provided below: The minimum of these measures was then used to estimate dividend growth for the next three years. - Return on equity times the earnings reinvestment rate - Analyst estimates for earnings growth for the next five years - Earnings growth over the past five years Payback period estimates depend on earnings growth and dividend payout ratios. Payout ratios were assumed constant, and dividend yield was projected by taking the minimum of the following: Since many dividend investors are attracted to high-paying dividend companies on the premise that they can ignore what the markets do and simply focus on their dividend income, the payback period provides a reality-check for how long payback based on dividend payments could take. The number of years it takes for an investment to pay you back is called the payback period. It is a simple and crude measure of risk. Other investment metrics like required return do not always match up to the calculated payback period. This is because required return takes into account how dividend distributions in earlier years are worth more than the same dollar value paid out in the future. (You would be able to reinvest the earlier distribution and earn a return on it, making earlier distributions worth more.) Calculating Payback Periods Part of the allure of",

To address this limitation, a terminal 3% dividend growth rate was applied for every stock in the list after three years of projected growth rates.
