She returned during winter 2012 for a series of community snow drawings on Rabbit Ears Pass\u00a0 that received national and international attention., 4390=About the artist: An excerpt from Sonja Hinrichsen's artist statement... \u201cSnow Drawings\u201d is an ongoing project where I \u201cdraw\u201d large designs in the environment by walking lines into fresh snow surfaces with snowshoes. Ideal \u201ccanvases\u201d are deforested areas and frozen lakes. The finished pieces are ephemeral. While they take hours to create, their duration is entirely unpredictable.\u00a0 Sometimes they are coated over by new snow shortly after completion. I began this project during an artist residency in Snowmass Village in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Out of play I started designing patterns in my mind, which I then transferred onto the snow. My designs have since become more elaborate and refined, and I have continued this project in other landscapes across the USA. In February 2012 I worked with community volunteers from Steamboat Springs, Colorado. This enabled me to create monumental pieces. During two community events that combined art-making and fun outdoor winter activity in a stunning landscape at Rabbit Ears Pass in the Western Colorado Mountains, we created large drawings that could only be seen from the air in their entirety \u2013 and only for a few days. Volunteers greatly enjoyed their partaking in these outdoor art-making events. As an environmentalist it is important to me that my interventions in nature are subtle and leave no lasting traces. I am not interested in creating lasting artworks, as I believe that our world is over-saturated with man-made products. I like to unfold my work into large immersive experiences, however I prefer that it live on in its documentation only, and \u2013 hopefully \u2013 in the memories of my audiences as well as those who participate in the creative effort. I hope that \u201cSnow Drawings\u201d accentuates the beauty and uniqueness of the natural environment, and thus inspires awe and appreciation for nature \u2013 especially as modern society becomes increasingly disconnected from the natural world., 5869=Sonja returns during winter 2013 to lead a single snow drawing on Lake Catamount. The local community is invited to join her in creating this large, landscape-scale work of art.}",
