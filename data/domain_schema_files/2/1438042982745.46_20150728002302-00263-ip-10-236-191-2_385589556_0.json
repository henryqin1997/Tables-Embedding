The Gravity Jersey fits over pads and body armor. It accommodates a protection jacket, so you can stay well-protected while you ride without feeling like your jersey is trying to squeeze you to death. 3/4-length sleeves offer added protection from sun and debris without bunching up or getting in the way of your gloves. The slightly higher sleeve openings also allow air to flow freely into the jersey. The Gravity Jersey was designed to take the edge off the hottest summer days. The spandex/synthetic blend stretches for an unlimited range of motion, so you won't ever feel the Gravity jersey bind up while you ride. This also adds to the jersey's durability, because it stretches rather than tears. The synthetic fabric pulls moisture away",
