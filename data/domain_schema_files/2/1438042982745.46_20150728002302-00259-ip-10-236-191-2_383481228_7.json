In the lsoter family there are self-reactive grades recommended as co-polyol in order to obtain the desired reaction profile and curing of the system in the various conditions of application. lsoter are very compatible vs. lsoexter therefore it is possible to formulate systems combining the best properties of the two products families. The wide range of grades available allows the selection of the more appropriate type according to the blowing agents used in the system and the final foam properties desired. Isoter have been obtained by designing molecular weights and functionalities in order to satisfy the need of the specific application in terms of process and system performance. The relative foams show very good physical-mechanical properties mainly as far as dimensional stability and adhesion are concerned. lsoter products are polyether polyols used in the formulations of systems for PU rigid foam production.
