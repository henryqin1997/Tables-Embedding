We need a stud on the blue line...until Murray or Reinhart or whoever we draft (and I'm on the \"draft a D\" bandwagon) matures into the NHL player that can anchor that blue line, we can always build our blue line around depth. I'm not convinced the Canucks have that top dman that teams covet, but they sure do have depth...our prospects will provide that to a degree, but so will the next Cam Barker (I'm really hoping the next one ISN'T Cam Barker, but that seems apparent based on the number of games he's played recently). So yeah, if we draft Murray it could be a year or 2 until he is a regular NHL'er, and another year or 2 until he is that top guy we need. Petry is just turning out for us, and he may turn out to be our #1 guy...what's his record and the team record since...say February'ish when he turned his game up a notch? Whitney may be feeling a bit better in September too...with very little tweaking this summer, we may already have the team we need to get into the playoffs...Dubnyk is playing great, Petry has emerged this year, same with Smid, Eberle & Hall took their game to another level, Nuge is in the running for the best rookie of the year...our previous drafting is still picking up the pace...I don't want to see another year of non-playoff hockey, as I'm sure the rest of you don't either...but picking the BPA is my thought, and I don't think you discount that player because he's a dman (if he's Russian on the other hand...maybe)..., 86650=LAST GAME - April 11th, 2015}",

In other words, the comparable season to this year for players picked in the 2012 Entry Draft is 2015-16. The top five picks in 2008 all yielded useful NHL defensemen, and that figure may rise if Colten Teubert is able to carve out a career for himself on the Oilers\u2019 blue line. Drew Doughty had a phenomenal rookie season, but these days his point production has dipped noticeably. I\u2019d still take him in a heartbeat, but it hasn\u2019t all been smooth sailing. In fact, every player on this list has either had a (relatively) slow start to their careers or has had some ups and downs along the way in the NHL. If the Oilers take a guy like Ryan Murray or Matt Dumba, it may be years before we really know who they are as NHL\u2019ers.\u00a0 Many of the best performers immediately after their draft year have since been eclipsed; there are undoubtedly people now who see Karlsson (minus-30 last season) or Pietrangelo (twice returned to junior after <10-game tryouts) as the best players in this group.
