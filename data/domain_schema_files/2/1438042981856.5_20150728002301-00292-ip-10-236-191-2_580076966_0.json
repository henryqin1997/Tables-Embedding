Review the listing below to help begin your search for a mentor. If you find someone who you think could be a mentor it is recommended you introduce yourself to the mentor by email (if available) or phone. Your introduction should include your name, year at Montclair State University, your major or area you are interested in, and your initial question. How do you begin the process of choosing a mentor? Mentors are business or professional people who are in a unique position to introduce you to the workplace as a trusted advisor or guide. The mentors have been chosen because they have demonstrated achievement in their particular fields. You can ask questions and discuss work-related issues with your mentor. The relationship that you develop with the mentor depends on you! Mentors involved in this Program are all Montclair State University graduates who have volunteered to serve as mentors for EOP students. Mentoring is not intended for the mentor to become financially or emotionally responsible for you. The mentor is not a surrogate parent. Your mentor will be a guide to the world of work. Yor mentor can serve as an important liaison between school, the workplace, your neighborhood and business. The mentor will be able to bridge the gap between the theoretical world of the classroom and the real-life working word. What Isn't Mentoring",
