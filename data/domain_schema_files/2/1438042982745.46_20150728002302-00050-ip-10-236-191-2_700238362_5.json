Over the past two years he's averaged better than a strikeout per inning and has given up a miniscule .54 HR per nine innings. He's not developed into a closing candidate, but has remained a solid set-up man. It's a role he'll reprise in 2005 and he may vulture the occasional save when K-Rod can't take the hill., 35076=6/10/2010, 41574=2015, 35900=5/21/2010, 41776=Donnelly proved he wasn't entirely finished in 2009, posting great numbers for the Astros' Triple-A team before joining the Marlins late in the season and maintaining a strikeout-an-inning pace with a very good ERA and WHIP. Someone will probably give him another chance at a setup or middle-relief job, but even in his short stint with the Marlins he hit the DL with a hamstring injury, and at 38 he's getting neither younger nor healthier., 43122=Donnelly returns as the Angels top set-up man in 2006. He will work to regain the consistency that escaped him at times in 2005. When he's on, he's among the elite set-up men in the game. Donnelly had a rather large home-away split in 2005 posting a 2.79 home ERA vs. 4.46 on the road. This is the second straight season that gap has widened and may warrant keeping an eye on in 2006., 30389=Age is determined on July 1st of each season. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jump To:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25b2 Basic Stats \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25b2 Split Stats, 44680=Donnelly became a key cog in the Angels bullpen during their World Series run. He had a 2.17 ERA in 46 games during his rookie season and had a 2.8:1 strikeout/walk ratio. Depending on how he does in the spring, he could see some holds as the setup man to Troy Percival, but won't get more than the occasional save., 42614=2007, 41724=2010, 13184=Age is determined on July 1st of each season. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jump To:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25bc Advanced Stats, 36732=5/20/2010, 34215=6/12/2010, 43555=2005}",
