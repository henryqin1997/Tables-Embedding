Susan Kaplan, Director of Sustainability at the BPCA explains how this large dysfunctional area on the waterfront was seen by the then ex-governor of New York, Nelson A. Rockefeller, as an opportunity to have full jurisdiction over buildable areas and, through the strategy of reclaimed land, start an entire new city jutting out from Manhattan Island [18]. The development of BPC goes through two distinct phases that are visually experienced with a visit to the site. The first goes from the mid-sixties to the new master plan of 1979. It is defined by several master plans that result in closed communities such as the Gateway, which shows exclusion to street life and nature. The second phase stems from the 1979 master plan. This phase begins to include environmental considerations, primarily at an urban design scale, and can be considered the reference driver for the rest of the BPC development., 20822=The source material of this study originates from on-site video interviews carried out during the construction process of the Battery Park City development in the periods 18-26 June and 14-17 November, 2007, and the period 27 September to 11 October, 2009, with the Battery Park City Authority (BPCA) director of sustainability, the architects in charge of the buildings concerned, and the BPC PV installer. The raw interview data is transcribed and subjected to content analysis to show emerging themes in the integration of PV in the building\u2019s design. The content of each theme is interpreted through observation and literature review. Conclusions are then drawn from the findings., 22681=Established in 1993, the mission of the IEA-PVPS program is to accelerate and promote the development and deployment of PV solar energy through information dissemination and a set of scheduled tasks. The program\u2019s premise is that of PV as a sustainable renewable energy source that can significantly contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions and world dependency on fossil fuels. Central issues relevant to the introduction of PV in buildings, accountable for more than 40% of the world\u2019s energy demands are PV economy, government incentives, and technological innovation. In support of the advantages of integrating PV in buildings we find studies, from both IEA-PVPS program and independent sources, which focus on the PV\u2019s economic, environmental, and architectural added value [8,9,10,11]., 45085=It is suggested, however, that it is the very challenges posed by the introduction of PV in the city and the stringent building and environmental guidelines set by the BPCA that has triggered a set of attractive advantages for architects and developers. To begin with, architects were given the opportunity to show, in a highly visible way, the environmental commitment of their practice. BPC has also shown to be an incubator for the use of PV in the city, drawing architects and developers to use PV in their future projects and engage in the use of PV systems with more confidence. An example is the Helena building in New York, by Fox and Fowle architects, completed in 2005. As PV installer of the Helena, Anthony Pereira [23] states that the decision to include PV in the building\u2019s design agenda was fostered by the physical evidence provided by the BPC buildings, bringing forth confidence to the PV initiative. Likewise, the Albanese Developing Corporation, developer of the Solaire, the Verdesian, and the Visionaire has, since their experience at BPC, started to incorporate green buildings strategies as a norm, with the inclusion of PV in most of their projects. Most importantly, the BPC development has triggered the activation of PV government financial support and tax breaks incentives, making the inclusion of PV in buildings\u2019 more attractive to clients, architects, and developers, expanding the use of PV in architecture and pushing for innovative solutions., 87441=\u00a9 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

In fact, the BPCA 2000 Guidelines requirement to provide only 5% of the base energy load, updated in 2004 to 0.75% of the building\u2019s base energy loads calculated on the actual PV energy produced, is a small contribution to a building\u2019s energy demands, particularly when compared to the estimated energy potential of BIPV. To put things in perspective, based on a IEA-PVPS report, it is estimated that if building surfaces are used that generate 80% of the maximum solar power, the ratio between BIPV solar electricity production and current electricity consumption can vary from 15% to almost 60% in IEA countries [13]., 30066=In 2000, the BPCA establishes the Hugh L. Carey Battery Park City Authority Residential Environmental Guidelines [20]. The formulation of the guidelines is coeval to the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System [21]. It distinguishes itself from LEED, however, by setting mandates, rather then options, with stringent requirements for the provision of renewable energy and green power sources. The guidelines mandates that renewable energy sources be incorporated in the BPC building\u2019s design to initially provide 5% of the base energy load of each building; that is: the load of the buildings\u2019 non-tenanted spaces. Several studies are conducted to explore the different renewable energy options, including wind and biomass. The application of PV systems, however, quickly appears to the developers as the most tested and economic option, and as such it is adopted in the BPC buildings., 15895=Buildings 2013, 3(2), 341-356; doi:10.3390/buildings3020341, 18794=Photovoltaic (PV) cells transform the visible spectrum of solar radiation (photons) into electrical energy. The greater the efficiency of the PV cell, the larger the PV surface area exposed, and the better the PV\u2019s position with respect to the sun, the greater the total electrical output produced. It is important to remember that initial use and testing of PV cells occurred in outer space. In 1958, PV cells were installed in the satellite Vanguard to generate energy to power its radio transmitters. The event was significant because it demonstrated the original scope and potential of PV: to effectively generate self-sufficient energy from the sun. This machine-like function and high-tech aesthetic of PV remains fundamentally unchanged and is arguably what challenges architects when PV systems are to be integrated in a building\u2019s design. The integration of PV in architecture, however, can also potentially provide an important supply of electricity for a building\u2019s energy demand and significantly contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions. The application of PV systems in the Battery Park City (BPC) buildings represents a challenge that architects face globally when presented with PV technology; that is, to make PV perform and assimilate it as constituent parts of the design process., 31122=The BPC buildings under investigation, completed between 2003 and 2011, represent a test case in PV application. The details of these buildings are shown below, in Table 1. All the buildings follow tight zoning and geometric constraints on massing, orientation, and envelope directives (i.e., the fa\u00e7ade\u2019s ratio of opaque to transparent).}",

Emerging Themes The emerging themes from the interviews are categorized in four sections, namely: The \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d (discusses the effects of mandating PV systems in the BPC development); PV and building integration (discusses the architect\u2019s different approaches to PV integration in the design process); PV industry and design process (discusses the difficult relationship between PV industry and the design process); Green visible (brings out the PV overall prevailing function at BPC, comparing the short term symbolic function of PV with its potential long term goal). 4.1. The \u201cCarrot and Stick\u201d Residential development is an exceedingly money conscious sector of the building industry. Newly built residential buildings must generate a certain pre-calculated return, and anything outside of a tested financial program is seen with scepticism and as a risk. Kaplan, states that having mandated the use of PV as renewable generation system through the BPCA residential guidelines has fostered the development of the PV industry in the residential sector [22]. According to Anthony Pereira [23], President and CEO of AltPower, the BPC PV installer, \u201cthe reality is that if you did not use the stick, no one would apply the technology, no matter what the incentive. The stick had to happen for it to happen\u201d. For the scope of this study, the question is: what effect",
