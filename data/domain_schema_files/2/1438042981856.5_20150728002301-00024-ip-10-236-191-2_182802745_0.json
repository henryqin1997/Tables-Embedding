    "textAfterTable": "I haven\u2019t narrowed this down to my list of preferred comparable players; generally I would go through and eliminate players who aren\u2019t roughly the same size as Eberle, play a significantly different style, and then I\u2019d filter the remainder by past years to find ones with a similar career curve to Eberle. I\u2019ll likely do that later once Eberle\u2019s rookie season is complete, but for now I think it\u2019s more interesting to consider the range of options. Still, there are items on this list that I feel warrant comment. First off, Sam Gagner\u2019s place on this list is an interesting one to me. Had he recorded just two more assists as a 20-year old, we would find his name above Eberle\u2019s. Yet, the perception of Gagner last season and the perception of Eberle this season are wildly divergent in my experience; it\u2019s as if the Oilers mistaken decision to elevate Gagner to the NHL as an 18-year old has prompted many to lose patience with him. I don\u2019t understand it. Martin Havlat and Alex Tanguay both appeal to me here \u2013 both are good, solid two-way wingers and I think if Eberle follows in their footsteps there won\u2019t be much reason for disappointment. That\u2019s roughly the upper range I have in mind when I watch the player. For those who view those projections as too pessimistic, I would remind them that both players spent multiple seasons in the point-per-game range or higher, and that Havlat\u2019s",
