With the new season edging nearer, our chairman spoke to the Official Site and said that he believed that Johnson was building a very strong squad that was more than capable of challenging at the right end of League 1. 'I think Lee has built a tremendous defence and the midfield is looking really strong at the moment. We probably need to reinforce up front with one or two players but we have the basis for a really good team at the moment.' Corney says that at this stage of the season he always gets incredibly excited about our chances for the coming year, and he's very confident that our manager now knows what it takes to get into the top six, and he believes he is successfully working towards that with the squad he's establishing as time goes by. Of course it's not just on pitch development that Corney is pleased about, with the North Stand progressing nicely he also took the opportunity to discuss that. 'The new stand has given me a real lift. The fans and the workers at the club can see that there is growth and that is very important. It's probably not going to be ready for the start of the season but that's okay. If I thought we had 12-15,000 fans to accommodate, it would worry me a bit more but that's not the case unfortunately. We want to get it right, make sure it's perfect or as near to perfection as we can get it and if it's completely ready by January then I'm happy with that too.' Along with the new stand, it will also host conference and banqueting facilities which should be a nice alternative income source for the club, and of course it will have a gym on the ground floor and a medical unit on the top floor, and they should be big boosts as well.
