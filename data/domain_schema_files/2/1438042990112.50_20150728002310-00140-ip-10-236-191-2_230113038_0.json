    "textBeforeTable": "Whew, well there\u2019s five paragraphs I wish I didn\u2019t have to add to the front-page of the review. Once again, we are benchmarking with the reference card, but it has a 100MHz boost to the memory. We\u2019ll benchmark the other two cards, including Sapphire\u2019s reference using 3DMark Vantage only, for the sake of ease. Rather, Sapphire\u2019s card was actually following the reference clocks. I\u2019m uncertain as to the reason that there was ever a reference to a 900MHz memory clock, but if I had to guess, the HD 5450 was supposed to have a 900MHz clock, but for some reason, AMD backed it down to 800MHz. I\u2019m unsure why, however, as the card at 900MHz memory was absolutely rock-stable throughout all of our tests. Of course, I noticed the discrepancy after all of our benchmarking was completed. Like the reference card, Gigabyte\u2019s model was also overclocked (+50MHz to the core) and I thought Sapphire\u2019s was, but it turned out later on that I was wrong. For some reason there, GPU-Z showed that the card had a default clock of 650/900, but I mis-read it and thought those were the actual clocks. To add to the confusion just a bit more, our performance didn\u2019t exactly match what the press deck we were given showed, either. Our card performed a lot better. But after talking to AMD, it stated that with that 100MHz boost to the memory, it would equate to about a 5.5% performance boost on average, so nothing major. It",
    "textAfterTable": "The HD 5450 is in all regards a very low-end card. It has 5% of the total number of cores as the HD 5870, a 64-bit memory bus, and the slowest clocks of the bunch. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t reveal the HD 5570 clocks at this time, but I can assure you that the card will be faster than the HD 5450, and slower than the HD 5670 (it\u2019s reasons like these that I lack friends). I admit, that for a card that\u2019s to sell for around $50, the reference version straight out of AMD has one of the coolest (no pun) passive coolers I\u2019ve ever seen, if not the coolest. It\u2019s unfortunate, though, because I\u2019m not quite sure how adopted this will be. All I\u2019ve seen of HD 5450\u2019s from other vendors so far have been their own cooler designs. Whether they are cool, or do a good job at cooling, we\u2019ll soon see. The reference card includes HDMI, DVI and VGA ports, and Gigabyte\u2019s card below follows that. The Sapphire card sways from this just a wee bit by offering a DisplayPort connector in lieu of the HDMI. Like AMD itself, Sapphire has also opted to go with a completely passive design, except its card is much, much thinner, and doesn\u2019t at all block other slots. The",
