In a season of such small margins prosperity is likely to hinge on who is able to best hold their nerve when it comes to the crunch, although there is also a nagging worry that weather could also have a fundamental impact on proceedings. After a month\u2019s break - which was either welcomed or maligned depending on your situation \u2013 the County Championship makes it\u2019s much-anticipated return from exile this week.

In comparison Notts were forced to overcome a sticky start which saw them loss two of their three opening fixtures but a run of three victories in four means Chris Read\u2019s side arguably currently carry the momentum, although deciphering where the impetus lies after the break is arguably a futile task. It is difficult to envisage Yorkshire\u2019s solidarity deserting them at this late stage \u2013 their astoundingly consistent batsmen have on 11 of 12 occasions exceeded 400 \u2013 nonetheless there is a nagging feeling that an absence of killer instinct has the potential to deny them ultimate glory.
