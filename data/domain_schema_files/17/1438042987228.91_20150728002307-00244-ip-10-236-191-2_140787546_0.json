    "textAfterTable": "*Replacement costs are subject to change The serious stuff You are financially responsible for damaged or lost items and parts. Normal wear and tear is okay. A hold can be placed on your academic record and registration if replacement fees are not paid. Don\u2019t be late! There is a late fee of $10 per day for AV items, and $5 per hour for laptops ($10 in fines will suspend your library privileges until paid.) All cables and accessories must be returned to avoid late charges. You must have a PolyCard to check out equipment. Please check the laptop software\u00a0page to see a list of all the software installed on each laptop. Checkout for 3-hour items ends approximately 3 \u00bd hours prior to the closing of the Poly Connect desk. Because closing times vary during the quarter, please call 805-756-6546 to verify today\u2019s hours. Enjoy and please treat our equipment with the respect it deserves so that it continues to function well for the next student to use it. Also,\u00a0please give us your feedback\u00a0\u2014 we like that! Renewals As with anything you check out from Kennedy Library, you can manage your account online from PolyCAT. You\u2019ll need your PolyCard number to log in. \u00a0",
