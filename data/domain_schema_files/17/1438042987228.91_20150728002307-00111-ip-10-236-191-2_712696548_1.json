Not only was this situated far from most of the competition venues, personnel and food quality were below par - even for four soldiers. The Dutch team dominated the opening dressage event, placing first through fourth. The leader, Colenbrander, fell in the ranking after the cross-country. As only the top three per country counted towards the gold medal, but with the other riders placing 2nd, 4th and 6th, the Dutch team kept in the lead.
