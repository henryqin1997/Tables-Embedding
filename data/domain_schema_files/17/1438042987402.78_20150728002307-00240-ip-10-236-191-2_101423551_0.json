It lists only main activities to give volunteers an idea of the variety of projects planned as well as free time built into the schedule. Projects this summer will focus on three areas: Education/Learning, General Support of Families in Need, and Ministries. One of our goals is to continually increase involvement of local volunteers in these efforts. For clarification purposes, some activities are described below: School Supply Distribution: This comprises the greatest amount of time and effort in our summer projects. We will be distributing backpacks, school supplies and shoes to 350 children. This is a large undertaking that will take place over 5 different days as we distribute these items and fit shoes to approximately 70 children during each distribution event. Gran Bazar: This event allows local families to obtain clothing, shoes and household goods at greatly reduced prices. It also serves as a fund raiser for Friends of Cozumel scholarships. Distribution of reading magnifier glasses to those who need them may be done during the gran bazar or other events. Support of Vida Abundante Church: Support of EBDV (Vacation Bible School) Volunteers will lead craft workshops and provide refreshments. Facilities Shelves will be constructed to finish off a new storage room that has been built to securely store materials and",
