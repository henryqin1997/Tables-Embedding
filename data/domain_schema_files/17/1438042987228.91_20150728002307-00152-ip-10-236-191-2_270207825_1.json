Music Quizzes\u2019 Top Loves increased by 23,000 MAU, a 329 percent increase that secured the No. 3 position. Olsen Bro Gaming\u2019s Combat Extreme came in at No. 4 with 20,000 MAU, a 50 percent increase. Soccer sim Galatasaray Fantasy Manager took No. 5 with 20,000 MAU, another 50 percent increase. IGG\u2019s Dawn of Darkness (PH) took the No. 1 spot among this week\u2019s emerging Facebook games, up 400 percent with 40,000 monthly active users. This game appears to be a regional version of the original Dawn of Darkness, but featured English-language text when we loaded it; perhaps it\u2019s the version launched in the\u00a0Philippines.
