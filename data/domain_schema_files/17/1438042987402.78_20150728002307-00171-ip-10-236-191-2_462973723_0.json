The hatchback models are still stylish, but against newer competition, the Yaris falls short on features and interior comfort. As one of the shortest subcompacts on sale, it\u2019s better as an urban runabout\u2014and it can park almost anywhere\u2014than as a long-distance traveler. It\u2019s affordable, and has a good reputation for reliability, but falls short on many creature comforts., 384=For more details, see the full review of the 2011 Toyota Yaris on our sister site, TheCarConnection., 1063=We\u2019re not fans of gauge clusters mounted in the center of the dash, and there\u2019s little to love in the rest of the 2011 Toyota Yaris interior. The stylish looks of the instrument panel are betrayed by swaths of hard plastic., 824=Worst of all, the single trim level of the 2011 Yaris harkens back to the days of grim, low-spec \u201ceconomy cars\u201d with extra cost associated with even the most basic of features. You have to pay extra for cruise control, iPod connectivity, and Bluetooth connectivity, for example, which are becoming standard on increasing numbers of subcompacts like the Ford Fiesta.

Worst of all, the single trim level of the 2011 Yaris harkens back to the days of grim, low-spec \u201ceconomy cars\u201d with extra cost associated with even the most basic of features.

We\u2019re not fans of gauge clusters mounted in the center of the dash, and there\u2019s little to love in the rest of the 2011 Toyota Yaris interior. The stylish looks of the instrument panel are betrayed by swaths of hard plastic. Inside, the front seat cushions are short and the skimpy seat backs offer little side support, another incentive not to drive the Yaris too aggressively. Taller drivers will be cramped in front, though average-sized humans will fit in the back of either body style\u2014barely\u2014if they splay their legs around the front seat backs. The sedan\u2019s trunk is surprisingly large, however. The Yaris is small and light enough that this low-powered engine is sufficient for urban traffic, though it\u2019s hardly as responsive and fun to drive as a Honda Fit or that definitive urban roller skate, the Mini Cooper. Toyota has opted for ride comfort over roadholding in",
