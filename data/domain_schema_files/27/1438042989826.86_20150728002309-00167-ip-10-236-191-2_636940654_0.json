Donations to Democrats, Donations to Republicans, and the associated percentages are based solely on contributions to candidates and parties. Independent expenditures and electioneering communications are not reflected in the breakdown by party. While election cycles are shown in charts as 1996, 1998, 2000 etc. they actually represent two-year periods. For example, the 2002 election cycle runs from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2002.\u00a0, 11040=NOTE: Soft money contributions to the national parties were not publicly disclosed until the 1991-92 election cycle, and were banned by the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act following the 2002 elections. Contributions to Outside Spending groups legalized by the 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission Supreme Court decision are listed in the \"Soft/Outside Money\" column as are donations of \"Levin\" funds to state and local party committees. Levin funds were created by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002., 10917=Data for the current election cycle were released by the Federal Election Commission on Monday, June 17, 2013.}",
