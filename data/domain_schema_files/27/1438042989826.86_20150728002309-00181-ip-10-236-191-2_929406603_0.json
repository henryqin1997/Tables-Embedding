This was the year that the engine power overtook the capabilities of the Studebaker Automatic Drive, and thus Borg-Warner supplied stronger but less advanced Ford-O-Matic units to Studebaker. Studebaker also introduced a new sub-series, the upscale President Sky Hawk hardtop coupe, with an above-top-of-the-line separate Golden Hawk line of hardtop coupes added for good measure. These were the \u201cpersonal cars\u201d that Studebaker CEO James Nance had desired, and they beat the four-seat Ford Thunderbird to market by two years. The 1957 and 1958 cars were carried over, with no real substantive changes except for the addition of dual headlamps, tall tailfins and a very attractive \u201ctaller body\u201d two-door hardtop for 1958., 13145=Following Packard\u2019s acquisition of Studebaker in 1954, the President line was added as a new top-of-the-line model for Studebaker, slightly closing the gap between the Studebaker line and the Packard\u2019s mid-priced Clippers. This name had last been used in 1942 for the eight-cylinder Studebakers, which did not return to production after WWII. The President was an excellent addition to the economy Champion and mid-priced Commander lines, and helped Studebaker round out its product lineup., 14376=In 1956, the super-low styling for mainstream Studebaker cars was revamped to look more \u201cimportant\u201d and more similar to competitors. A taller hood and more squared off decklid and overall styling were adopted for the family cars, along with wrap-around windshields which had debuted half way through 1955., 13649=Studebaker\u2019s 1955 cars most prominently featured a large chrome grille. Under the hood, a 259-cid V-8 with a four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts provided the car with 185 hp. The new \u201cPassmaster\u201d V-8 was well named, and was available with overdrive transmission or Studebaker Automatic Drive.}",

Studebaker Presidents are terrific artifacts of 1950s American motoring, with smart engineering and clever design.
