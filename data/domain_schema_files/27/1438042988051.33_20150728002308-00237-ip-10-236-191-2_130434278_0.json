He was named Third Star of the Week for November 4th to 10th after a 6 assists in 3 games. Five of those were on the powerplay, where he hasn't typically gotten much time for Rimouski. Having now tied his point total from last season in just 23 contests, we can hope Kostalek is taking advantage of extra opportunity and not simply on a bit of a streak.\u00a0, 3944=Kevin McCartney November 18 2013 05:45PM, 93720=Lethbridge has a -57 goal differential, and has scored a WHL worst 61 goals.

    "textAfterTable": "This is mostly bad news. The team itself is -1 in goal differential, and playing .500 hockey (though it's been an up and down road to get there). Klingberg has come alive since our last check-in. He had just 2 points in 8 games, meaning he has 3 in his last 5. Lowry continues to struggle with injury and ineffectiveness. With his large frame and excellent skating, I really thought he would be an impact player in the AHL early. Perhaps it's a health issue first and foremost, but this is not a WHL MVP kind of season. Brenden Kichton is having an excellent year, though. Kichton leads defencemen in scoring. Ben Chiarot is second in shots by defenceman, and may even get on the table next update. On a team where defenceman Will O'Neill is -11, Chiarot is +4 and Kichton +5. It's not a good statistic in general, but we can start to see some of the chasm on this team between the top players and the bottom. O'Dell is also having a terrific year, picking up where he left off last season with the team lead in points, shots, and general make-stuff-happen-ness. There may come a point where the team has to consider swapping him with Scheifele on the NHL roster. WHL",
