Used on the ABC-M7A2 CS, ABC-M7A3 CS, and M84 stun hand grenades. The M201A1 is designed for use with the AN-M83HC white smoke grenade, the AN-M14 TH3 incendiary grenade, and the M18 colored smoke grenade. This fuze is interchangeable with any standard firing device. The time delay element is a powder train requiring 1.2 to 2 seconds to burn to the igniter. The igniter ignites the filler or a pyrotechnic starter with a violent burning action and expels the filler from the grenade body. M201A1 pyrotechnic delay-igniting fuze. Igniting Fuze. Igniting fuzes are designed for use with chemical hand grenades. They burn at high temperatures and ignite the chemical filler. The detonator bursts the grenade body and disperses the riot control agent over an area about 5 meters in diameter. At the bottom of the fuze well, the slider strikes the firing pin and ignites the delay element which, in turn, sets off the detonator. When the arming sleeve is released, the slider",

The ABC-M7A3 has 7.5 ounces of burning mixture and 4.5 ounces of CS pellets. The bodies of both grenades are sheet metal with four emission holes at the top and one at the bottom.

The ABC-M25A1 riot control hand grenade is a bursting munition with an integral fuze. All fillers are mixed with silica aerogel for increased dissemination efficiency.
