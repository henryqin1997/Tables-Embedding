    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{22213=The new incarnation is fitted with a new 6,400 DPI optical sensor, which they claim is a world\u2019s first. While other of their mice already contain a dual sensor, in the DeathAdder Razer wanted to retain the feel of an optical sensor which has made this mouse so popular, while boosting its performance. The 2013 edition of Razer DeathAdder still uses the same ergonomic design featured by its previous versions, but was improved with new rubber side grips. They\u2019ve also gone with a textured matte black finish, which makes the mouse much grippier and better to touch then the old glossy smooth plastic on the earlier models., 22850=Razer is a bit stingy with the number of buttons when it comes to the DeathAdder series. The 2013 edition, as the earlier ones, only has 5 programmable buttons which includes the left, right and the scroll wheel button. It\u2019s a bit disappointing that it has no dedicated DPI buttons, but you can still assign those functions to the two buttons on the left side of the mouse. The Razer DeathAdder 2013 gaming mouse comes with Razer Synapse 2.0 software, which lets you set up the mouse just the way you like it. From adjusting the DPI, changing button assignments, and set the polling rate to turning lighting effects on or off. For the more advanced users the software does also support macros. Of course you can have multiple profiles, so you don\u2019t have to use the same settings for each game., 21734=Razer is a company solely devoted to gaming peripherals and most widely known for their superior gaming mice. The original Razer DeathAdder was released in late 2006 and updated in late 2009 as DeathAdder 3500. With the release of the 2013 edition, Razer has once again updated one of its most popular gaming mouse., 35641=But Razer Naga 2012 isn\u2019t the only one wearing the Naga name. It is actually a series of four mice., 36365=This version features the same placement of the 2 DPI buttons as the original Naga. They\u2019re placed on the left side of your left mouse button rather than behind the wheel. Some players find this placement more comfortable and easy to reach, while others found that they were too easy to hit on accident and prefer the new 2012 layout., 35156=The mice we reviewed above we all meant to be used in all kinds of games. That isn\u2019t entirely true for the Razer Naga 2012. This top notch gaming mouse is first and foremost an MMO mouse. This is why it has 17-MMO optimized buttons. In between the left and the right is the scroll wheel button, and behind that are two DPI adjusting buttons. The remaining 12 buttons are placed on the left side in a 3\u00d74 grid formation, which makes this a purely right-handed mouse., 36140=The wireless version of Naga 2012 with an option to plug the cable directly into your mouse and charge it while you play. The Epic also features an anti-slip rubber paint finish., 37667=Razer Naga 2012 and Razer Naga Epic also offer 3 different interchangeable side panels. You can choose which ever you want to fit your hand size and your grip style. This allows you to be comfortable during those long hours if raiding and grinding.}",
