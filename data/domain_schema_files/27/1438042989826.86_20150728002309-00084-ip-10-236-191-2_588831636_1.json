They have been around for 96 years and are rated a 5 star bank by Bauer Financial (www.bauerfinancial.com)., 102454=If safety and stability are paramount to you, a conventional CD may be your best choice \u2013 so long as you ensure that the bank you choose is insured by the FDIC. FDIC coverage is designed to protect funds up to $250,000 per depositor per institution in the event of a bank failure, and it has never failed to cover insured deposits since the FDIC\u2019s inception in 1933., 110701=29 March 2012 at 3:26 pm, 132697=25 August 2009 at 10:51 am, 132223=25 August 2009 at 5:39 pm, 138707=30 June 2009 at 1:40 pm, 141065=20 June 2009 at 3:46 pm, 116997=2 August 2011 at 2:48 pm, 107377=You report State Bank of India paying 2.05% APR for 5 year CD as of Oct. 30, 2013.

For most savers, paying attention to the news headlines is enough. Decisions that could move short-term interest rates are made by the Federal Open Market Committee, which next meets in July and September. The current Wall Street consensus is that the earliest a hike in the federal funds rate could come, if at all, will be in September., 134847=8 August 2009 at 9:59 am, 122685=25 February 2011 at 11:47 am, 123548=26 January 2011 at 6:58 am, 113322=21 November 2011 at 8:08 pm, 109203=9 September 2012 at 5:13 am, 136968=11 July 2009 at 8:41 am, 134141=13 August 2009 at 3:17 pm, 135531=3 August 2009 at 6:40 pm, 130683=8 May 2010 at 12:00 pm, 13002=Rates as of 8/3/2015 FDIC Insured, 111077=If the Monument Bank listed in 5-year CDs is the one in the Maryland-DC-Virginia area, the rates are lower than shown. As of March 1, the 60-month rate was 1.30%, not 1.98%. That discrepancy makes me think this must be another bank - where?, 108895=Hi zaqxsw, Based on Doral Bank Direct's Web site the APY for the 3 year CD is 1.35% effective as of 9/9/2012. They also offer a 6 month CD earning 0.92% APY.

Hmmm...This sounds tempting; however, I am wondering if it would really be prudent to lock my $$$ in for such a long-term. I currently have two existing jumbo CD's - One with Capital One Bank that I opened in August 2008 for 5-years @ 5.12% (5.25% APY) and the other with Sovereign Bank - 5-years @ 2.96% (3.00% APY). My Capital One CD is due to mature in August 2013 & my Sovereign Bank CD will not mature 'til February 2016. I am wondering, at this rate, with the overall dismal outlook on our US economy, if the Federal Funds rate will ever be increased again. The Fed's say inflation remains subdued and under control. Well, I guess that's true if you don't eat or drive an automobile., 118183=15 July 2011 at 12:34 pm, 141294=19 June 2009 at 4:35 pm}",
