These gigabit Ethernet interface modules deliver wire-speed switched connectivity and support several switch fabric connections and traffic forwarding options, these include: Classic, CEF256, dCEF256 and CEF720. With a range of port densities and modular physical layer interfaces, these modules also offer a choice of packet buffer depths for traffic shaping, and QoS granularity with varying number of queues and drop threshold options. These key features are important aspects to in determining best module for a given network application (Table 1). Gigabit Ethernet Applications and Key Features \u25cf\u00a0\u00a0 Extensive management tools: Support CiscoWorks network management platform, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) versions 1, 2, and 3 and four RMON groups (statistics, history, alarms, and events) \u25cf\u00a0\u00a0 Superior traffic management: Available with large per-interface buffers and multiple-priority queues for traffic prioritization and policing, allowing for tight service-level agreement (SLA) enforcement \u25cf\u00a0\u00a0 Maximum network uptime and resiliency:",
    "textAfterTable": "\u00a0 * Queues Legend: 1p2q2t= 1 priority queue, 2 round robin queues, 2 thresholds \u00a0 Superior Traffic Management and Queuing Characteristics of Catalyst 6500 series Gigabit Ethernet Modules The Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Gigabit Ethernet modules support multiple queues per port for Quality of Service. Each port supports Weighted Random Early Detection (WRED) for congestion avoidance within each queue, and Weighted Round Robin (WRR) for scheduling between queues and a strict priority queue for voice traffic. Additionally, multiple thresholds can be configured to manage differentiated levels of service. Ideal for handling mission-critical, bursty, or low latency traffic such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) or voice applications, these interface modules, including the CEF720-based WS-X6724-SFP, scale network performance and intelligent services. These modules also feature transmit and receive packet buffers and a strict priority transmit queue. Cisco EtherChannel Technology\u2014Increases Link Resiliency and Provides Scalable Bandwidth Aggregation The Catalyst 6500 can aggregate up to eight physical Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet or 10Gigabit Ethernet links into a single virtual link using Cisco\u2019s Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) or IEEE 802.3ad technology. This provides network managers a reliable high-speed solution for the campus network backbone. The Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series also supports multimodule channeling technology, providing even greater resiliency by creating channels across ports on separate modules in the same chassis. As a result, connectivity is maintained even if one module (and corresponding ports) fails. This",
