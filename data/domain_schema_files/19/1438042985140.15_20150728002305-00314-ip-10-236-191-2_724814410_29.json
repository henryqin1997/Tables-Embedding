Lap five had Beckner still in the lead, with Thorburn right on his bumper. Kyle Hayden, Robbie Johnston, and Jay Woolworth joined the hunt for the top spot. Hayden took the lead on lap 10, with Woolworth climbing to second ahead of Thorburn and Ed Newman Jr. Dane Long began his march through the field and was sitting fifth behind Mike Ammerman by lap 15. Woolworth grabbed the top spot on lap 20 and brought Newman Jr. along with him while Long was sitting third. Ammerman made a pass for fourth on Hayden on lap 25, as Pat Dent sat just outside the top five. Lap 35 had Long looking high and low for a way around Newman Jr., but to no avail. At the checker, it was Woolworth, Newman Jr., Long, Ammerman, and Hayden. Thorburn and Johnston scored heat wins. Ten Figure 8 drivers lined up for a \u201cshotgun\u201d start with some of the Street Stock regulars doing double duty. Jamie Feguer was scored as the lap one leader, with Ray DerMiner taking over the spot on lap two. DerMiner led through lap5, when Jim Gokee issued a challenge and was the new leader by lap eight. Jeff Cummings made his move on DerMiner for second on lap 15 but could never catch Gokee, who had checked out on the field. At the end of 25 laps, it was Gokee, Cummings, DerMiner, Victor Hitsman, and Frank Erlenbeck. The Q106 Pony Stocks broke out of the starting gate with 14 little ponies all trying to lead lap one. Keith Holden held that honor for two laps before Jimmy Scavarda took over as the new leader. Trei Deubel, fast qualifier, who started at the rear of the field, had climbed to fifth by lap three. Scavarda had a two second lead over the field by lap six, with Willie Conroy and Trei Deubel ready to do battle for the second spot on lap 10. Lap 15 showed Deubel ahead of Conroy as they crossed the line and Julie Dailey moved into the top five ahead of George Wyers. Meanwhile, Scavarda had opened up a good lead when caution flew on lap 19, and at the line it was Scavarda, Conroy, Dailey, Wyers, and John Ward. Heat wins went to Steve Allen and Scavarda. Seventeen Super Pro Late Models started their 50-lap feature with fast qualifier, Logan Beckwith, starting eighth on the grid. Randy Cronenwett Jr. jumped out to lead lap one and led until lap 16, when Tommy Cook had been quietly making his way to the front from his eighth starting position, and Cook went on to show the way for the remainder of the race. Cronenwett Jr., Jake Louden, Robbie Johnson, and John Turnbull Jr. held down second through fourth. Logan Beckwith jumped into the mix on lap 42 when caution came out, closing up Cook\u2019s lead. Rob Buckley jumped into the fray on lap 43, with Beckwith challenging Turnbull, leaving Buckley trying to decide who to follow. At the line on lap 50, it was Cook, Louden, Beckwith, Buckley, and Turnbull Jr.}",
