So it\u2019s with great joy I bring some of these findings. The top pick from that draft, Jake Long, battled offseason injuries and took his time to get up to speed and languishes in 23rd spot after finishing first in 2010. The second tackle taken was Ryan Clady and he\u2019s having an even worse year than Long in 27th spot after giving up six sacks, three hits and 20 hurries. Indeed, the best performer from that draft class happens to be Branden Albert who comes in 10th overall, narrowly ahead of Duane Brown who is currently 13th. Of the other first-round tackles taken,\u00a0Gosder Cherilus is equal 27th with Clady, and Sam Baker is spared a ranking because he hasn\u2019t played enough time. If you take his rating and apply it to the ratings of the others, however, you have a guy who would be dead last., 2548=The Class of 2008, 1074=The best thing about this rating for me isn\u2019t continually pointing out how poor Levi Brown\u00a0is (dead last), but rather looking at the guys who have turned a corner after bad years gone by. Look at Trent Williams for example. Here\u2019s a player that as a rookie gave up 11 sacks, 11 hits and 24 hurries, and this year has knocked that figure down to two sacks, four hits and 13 hurries. The suspension takes the shine off an impressive year, but shouldn\u2019t make us forget the strides he took in 2011. Continuing the theme of the 2010 class coming good, Bryan Bulaga is ninth overall after finishing in the Bottom 15 last year and the eighth overall pick from 2009, Eugene Monroe, is putting in his best year as a pro.}",
