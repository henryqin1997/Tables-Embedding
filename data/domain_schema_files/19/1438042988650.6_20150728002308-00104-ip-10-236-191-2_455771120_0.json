While not growing by leaps and bounds, Merck's combination of pharmaceutical therapies and personal care products has yielded an incredible gross margin of 78.9%. Even more impressive than its ability to get the most out of every dollar has been its dedication to shareholders. Aside from a special dividend in 2003, shareholders haven't seen a drop in their quarterly payout since 1988.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "To find stable companies we need a balance of growth, strong cash flow, and solid margins. Using the Motley Fool CAPS screener, these criteria whittled thousands of stocks down to these 16: Gross margin > 40%. Revenue growth rate (3-year) > 15%. Dividend yield > 1.5%. Beta < 1.00. Market capitalization greater than $1 billion. With that in mind, I set out with the task of finding companies that you could buy right now instead of running for the hills like everyone else. The criteria I used to seek out these top companies are as follows: History has shown that losing a AAA credit rating isn't exactly a death sentence. In fact, when Canada and Japan lost their perfect credit marks, their stock markets actually rose over the following year. Another thing to consider is that many companies have more cash in their coffers than at any time in recent history. Recent data compiled from Standard & Poor's detailed that 444 companies raised their dividend payouts in the second quarter. Now is not the time to panic -- it's the time to be looking for bargains. Relax folks. The sky isn't falling. It's unfortunate that recent economic data show growth is slowing and that Standard & Poor's chose to downgrade the credit rating of the U.S. from its pristine AAA rating down to AA+; but things could be a whole lot worse.",
    "textAfterTable": "Source: Motley Fool CAPS. Of these 16 companies, I excluded five oil pipeline companies since they are too reliant on the price of oil, as well as Frontier Communications in the telecom sector since I don't particularly care for its large debt load and stagnant organic growth. Left with 10 possible choices, six stood out as companies you could buy right now! These companies offer the potential for dividend growth, have ample cash to weather any economic environment, and turn big profits with minimal expenses while offering less volatility than the S&P 500 -- the perfect recipe for a successful portfolio. Anheuser-Busch InBev Think about it; whether the economy is good or bad, consumers are going to buy beer -- and no name is more prominent in the beer industry than Budweiser in the U.S. Beyond our borders, the company has approximately 200 brand names under its belt. For a company as large as this, it might seem impossible for its long-term growth rate to reach almost 15%. But considering its global marketing approach and loyal customer base, this seems easily achievable. J.M. Smucker Companies in the food sector aren't impervious to recessions, but they often handle downswings much better than many other sectors. J.M. Smucker's products, for example, are easily recognizable by consumers and often occupy the median price-point on supermarket shelves, meaning it has a considerably more loyal customer base than many of its peers. It's no wonder Smucker's shareholders have been privy to",
