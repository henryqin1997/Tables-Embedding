            "A unrestricted file upload vulnerability exists in includes/inline_image_upload.php within AutoSec Tools V-CMS 1.0. This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by uploading a file with an executable extension and then accessing it via a direct request to the file in temp.",
            "A stack buffer overflow exist in FlexNet License Server Manager due to the insecure usage of memcpy in the lmgrd service when handling crafted network packets.",
            "This module exploits an unauthenticated file upload vulnerability on TP-Link IP cameras. Due to improper access restrictions, it is possible for a remote unauthenticated attacker to upload an arbitrary file to the /mnt/mtd directory on the camera by issuing a POST request against the file /cgi-bin/uploadfile.",
            "This update adds support for Solaris and Mac OS X platforms",
            "This package updates the Novell Messenger Server exploit.",
            "This module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability during the processing of TFTP Read/Write request packet types and cause a stack-based buffer overflow by sending a specially crafted packet with an overly long mode field.",
            "By including shell meta characters within the second parameter to the 'urt_test_url' XML-RPC methodCall, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands. The service typically runs with root privileges.",
            "This module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the mDNSResponder service running on certain versions of Apple Mac OS X. The vulnerability is exploited remotely by sending a specially crafted UPnP Internet Gateway Device (IGD) packet and installing an agent.",
            "Ricoh DC's DL-10 SR10 FTP Server is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability when handling data through the USER command. This can be exploited by supplying a long string of data to the affected command.",
            "The application is prone to a stack-based buffer-overflow vulnerability that occurs because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data. Specifically, this issue occurs when performing a direct peer file search.",
            "The UNCWS Web Service component of CA Total Defense listens for SOAP requests. The DeleteReports method makes use of the uncsp_DeleteReports stored procedure, which is vulnerable to SQL Injection. A remote unauthenticated attacker can exploit this to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable machine with SYSTEM privileges.",
            "This module exploits a vulnerability in Mac OS X Samba server. When a specially crafted call to \"NetWkstaTransportEnum\" RPC function is processed by the Samba server, it produces a heap overflow. This update adds support to Mac OSX 10.6.0 to 10.6.7 ( Server and not server versions ). Besides, this update improves the exploitation by reverting the Samba server impersonation and installing an agent with root privileges in all Mac OSX supported versions.",
