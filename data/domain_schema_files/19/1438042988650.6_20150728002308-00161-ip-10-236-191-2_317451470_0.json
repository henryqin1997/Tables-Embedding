I was told if Capello was prepared to back down then it probably would have been brushed under the carpet and he would have continued until after Euro 2012. It seems he has gone into the meeting, felt his authority had been undermined and could not continue. It has been a seismic shock for the England team and everybody involved in it., 725=Wednesday's meeting was the first time Capello had met the FA since their decision to remove the armband from Terry pending the outcome of his court case in July.}",

Terry, 31, denies a charge of allegedly racially abusing QPR's Anton Ferdinand. Wednesday's meeting was the first time Capello had met the FA since their decision to remove the armband from Terry pending the outcome of his court case in July. The FA will not be making any further comment until the media conference. A media conference with Bernstein and the Club England management team will take place at Wembley Stadium on Thursday at 1200 GMT. \"We have accepted Fabio's resignation, agreeing this is the right decision. We would like to thank Fabio for his work with the England team and wish him every success in the future.\" Read more of Phil McNulty's blog \"With Capello gone, the timing is perfect for England to benefit from the impetus that almost inevitably follows a new appointment and the arrival of fresh ideas and a different voice ahead of this summer.\" Chief Football Writer, BBC Sport Phil McNulty Analysis Bernstein",
