You'll soon arrive at a town center that is heavily guarded by enemy forces. Thankfully, a squad of allied reinforcements will land and distract the enemy. Use this chance to kill off the remaining Dominion and add the new marines to your controlled squad., 18636=You'll start on a dusty road along Mar Sara's wasteland. Your small squad will consist of five basic marines and Jim Raynor. Raynor is a hero unit, giving him special stats to be more powerful in battle. For this mission he must survive until the end., 272522=As you march forward with the attack command, continue to produce units depending on your resources. Carriers along with interceptors should be the main focus, with void rays being secondary. If you're low on gas, continue to produce zealots to support your stronger vehicles., 157608=With a sizeable army, march towards the hybrid for a final confrontation. Your objective is to free the three preservers, which will end the hybrid's resurrection., 123071=With a strong control group together, advance east to the Protoss artifact. They have set up turrets to stop you. In most cases, attack the pylons to stop their power, rather than going for the turrets themselves. When moving be sure to use the attack command, which will make your units stop to defend themselves, rather than suicide march., 231318=This is a good time to start scouting. Take either a single SCV or marine and march them into the enemy's base. This can momentarily harass them, but more importantly will reveal what they are constructing. You'll want to build an army that will effectively counter their plans. If your enemy is using mostly ground forces, siege tanks and banshees are a strong bet. For fighting an airforce, consider vikings and marines. Set up multiple factories and/or starports--all of which should have control groups--and start building your army. This force will cost a considerable amount of resources, so be sure to build more refineries and a command center in a nearby resource expansion. With a sizable army, place them all into a control group and send them towards the enemy via the attack command. If your assault is effectively damaging the enemy, consider changing your rally points closer to the battle itself., 24978=You'll come to a transport that is shipping off innocent colonists. Kill the marines and then takeout the transport vehicle itself as it has a mounted turret. The colonists will now support you for the remainder of the mission. With your increased numbers, march towards the enemy stronghold and destroy everything along your path. When the base is taken, the mission will end in victory.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Units Protoss Multiplayer Because the Zerg can form armies so quickly and cheaply, it is very easy to rush and/or harass your enemy. Sending in a wave of disposable zerlings will help you considerably as you man up a powerful mutalisk army. Likewise, because your troops are coming from one source, there will be fewer control groups to juggle around. As your assaulting units push more of the enmy, coninute to produce more mutalisks, hydralisks and zerlings to provide reinforcements. After scouting the enemy with an overlord, zergling, or drone, you'll need to form an army to combat your opponent. Roaches make for durable shock troops, though they aren't overly offensive. Hydralisks and mutalisks are excellent as a primary attacker, able to attack both air and ground forces. Be sure to also pump out more zerglings if you find yourself low on gas. Conversely, you may find that you are gaining far more minerals than you can expend. If this is the case, build more",
