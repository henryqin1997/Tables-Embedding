For the game, Tennessee Tech knocked down a total of 13 treys which also marked a school record for most in a single game., 17324=2000-01 HOME OPENER . . . Southern Illinois University's women's basketball team plays host to Tennessee Tech in its 2000-01 home opener Wednesday at 7:05 p.m. The Salukis, who are 145-64 all-time at SIU Arena, will try to put a stop to the Golden Eaglettes' three-game winning streak that currently stands in the 13-year old rivalry., 2764=NO REST FOR THE WICKED . . .

Prior to SIU, Opp served as a graduate assistant coach at Western Illinois (1988-90) and an assistant coach at Eastern Illinois (1990-93), Indiana State (1994-95), and Murray State (1995-98). With over 11 years of Division I coaching experience, Opp brings an unlimited amount of knowledge and enthusiasm to this year's squad as she is now the sixth head coach in the program's 41-year history., 8167=ABOUT THE SALUKIS . . . Southern Illinois returns to SIU Arena for its 2000-01 home opener after a two-game roadswing in Chicago, Ill., and Lafayette, La.

SIU and Tennessee Tech rekindles a series that made its debut in 1987 when the Golden Eaglettes defeated the Salukis 73-65 in Cookeville, Tenn. Since then, both teams have fought to an overall mark of 7-6 which currently stands in favor of TTU. Although the Golden Eaglettes have taken the previous three meetings which included last year's 74-64 win in Cookeville, Tenn., the Salukis will hope to prevail as the Dawgs hold a 25-13 advantage over their opponents in home openers.}",
