Historical prices are adjusted for dividends. General Motors highlights the risk of investing based on bailout expectations. The U.S. government stepped in and saved the operation with cash loans and an equity stake. The stock recently returned to the market with an initial public offering, but not before a bankruptcy that wiped out investors in the old GM, which is now called Motors Liquidation. Shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have lost more than 90% since bailouts were widely anticipated. Clearly a bailout for a company doesn't mean shareholders are safe. After big drops and likely backstops, companies like Allied Irish Banks (NYSE: AIB\u00a0\u00a0) and Bank of Ireland (NYSE: IRE\u00a0\u00a0) may look like tempting, if high-risk, buys. Rather than run the investment case for those banks, I want to review the share price history of some recent U.S. bailouts on the theory that history at least rhymes, even if it doesn't repeat. With all the reports of financial trouble and central bank bailout packages in Europe,",

I don't know how the European bailouts, banks, and backstops will play out. I'm sure some investors will find great bargains in the wreckage and some will lose lots of euros. I do know that in the recent U.S. version of this play, there was no need to rush in. Investors who waited on the details and then waited for bad news or panic to depress share prices did much better than those who bought on bailout and backstop speculation.
