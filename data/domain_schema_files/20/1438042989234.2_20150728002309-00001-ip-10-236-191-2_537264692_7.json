Rookie Marcos Ambrose (#59 Kingsford Ford) finished sixth \ufffd to date, his career best \ufffdand collected impressive statistics in the process. In June, Ambrose had an Average Running Position of 10.9, a Driver Rating of 93.1 and spent 174 of the 200 laps in the top 15. But the real story of the race earlier this summer was Edwards. He notched a perfect Driver Rating of 150.0, an Average Running Position of 2.1, notched 58 Fastest Laps Run and spent all 200 laps in the top 15. Edwards\ufffd perfect Driver Rating was one of just six in series history \ufffd including the most recent perfect line by Kyle Busch two weeks ago at Richmond. Dover is the only series track to produce two perfect Driver Ratings \ufffd Edwards last June and Ryan Newman in this race in 2005. Over the past five Dover races, Edwards has a Driver Rating of 113.1, an Average Running Position of 6.5, 119 Fastest Laps Run and 949 Laps in the Top 15 \ufffd all of which rank highest among drivers who have raced in each of the last five races at \ufffdThe Monster Mile.\ufffd Edwards needs to continue his Dover domination if he wants to keep up with the #29 Richard Childress Racing Chevy in the owner championship battle. The #29 leads Edwards\ufffd #60 Ford by 40 points. Scott Wimmer will pilot the #29 Chevy sponsored by Holiday Inn this weekend in Dover, a track at which he excels. In the three previous Dover races he has run, Wimmer has an average finish of 9.7, an Average Running Position of 11.5, a Driver Rating of 94.3 and has run 81 percent of his laps in the top 15., 117023=The final opportunity of the season for a driver to break the string of single winners at a NASCAR Busch Series track comes next Saturday afternoon at Kansas Speedway. ESPN2 will carry the Yellow Transportation 300 live beginning at 3 p.m. ET. There have been six different winners at Kansas, the most recent being reigning and two-time series champion Kevin Harvick last season. Kansas Speedway is one of five tracks \ufffd along with Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, Kentucky and New Hampshire \ufffd where there has yet to be a repeat winner. Matt Kenseth won the Busch Pole for this event last year, the third different pole winner in the last three events. Michael Waltrip won back-to-back poles at Kansas in 2002-03, the only driver to have multiple poles at the 1.5-mile track. \u00a0 FAST FACTS, 113603=ESPN2 continues its season-long coverage of the NASCAR Busch Series with live racing from Dover International Speedway. The telecast of the RoadLoans.com 200-mile race begins at 3 p.m. ET with NASCAR Countdown. Allen Bestwick will host the Dover episode of Countdown. He\ufffdll be joined in the ESPN Pit Studio by analyst Brad Daugherty, a former winning team owner in the NASCAR Busch Series and NASCAR CraftsmanTruck Series. Dr. Jerry Punch will anchor ESPN2\ufffds coverage from Dover, with analysis by 1989 NASCAR NEXTEL Cup champion Rusty Wallace and two-time champion crew chief Andy Petree. Pit reporters will be Dave Burns, Jamie Little, Mike Massaro and Shannon Spake, while two-time champion crew chief Tim Brewer will report from the ESPN DISH Tech Center., 101750=Two years ago, Martin Truex Jr. (#8 Sea Watch Chevy) and Clint Bowyer (#21 AutoZone Chevy) came to Dover International Speedway\ufffds fall race as the two drivers vying for the NASCAR Busch Series championship. They left as friendly rivals, laying the groundwork for their quick rise in NASCAR\ufffds premier series and a place in this year\ufffds Chase for the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup. They\ufffdll compete again this weekend in the NASCAR Busch Series at Dover, where Bowyer is the defending race winner. In September 2005, Truex \ufffd a Mayetta, N.J., native \ufffd was seeking his second consecutive series title and third consecutive win at his home track. Bowyer was the most resurgent \ufffd and arguably the most surprising \ufffd driver in the series, who was doggedly pursuing Truex. Bowyer finished second that day to Truex\ufffds 12th and was within 26 points of the standings lead. Although Truex never relinquished first place, the battle for the crown came down to the season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Perhaps it will again, albeit at a higher level. The duo used the NASCAR Busch Series as a developmental opportunity leading to their current success in the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series. \u00a0 Bowyer struck first. He won his first career premier series race last week at New Hampshire International Speedway in the first race of the Chase and is fourth in the standings.

We want them to get ample practice time and not \ufffdsave the tires\ufffd for the race.\u00a0 \ufffdAs always at this track, pit strategy will play an important role. Pit road is really compact here \ufffd and has those concrete boxes \ufffd so drivers need to have their cars under control when they come in and not slide their tires, which is a big key on a two-tire stop. \ufffdFuel strategy will most likely play into the final outcome, too, since some teams will probably take a chance on taking fuel only to gain track position.\ufffd, 115709=Kyle Busch\ufffds win at Richmond two weeks ago cemented Chevy\ufffds 14th NASCAR Busch Series Bill France Performance Cup and its fourth consecutive manufacturer\ufffds championship trophy. Now, the manufacturer looks to add to its place in series lore, counting on the Richard Childress Racing driver combination of Jeff Burton and Scott Wimmer to bring home only the second split driver/owner championship in NASCAR\ufffds national series history. In 2003, RCR \ufffd in a Chevy \ufffd captured the owner title with drivers Kevin Harvick and Johnny Sauter while Brian Vickers won the driver championship. The #29 has put up three wins this year (all by Burton) along with 14 top fives (10 by Burton, four by Wimmer) and 21 top 10s (13 via Burton, eight from Wimmer). Wimmer will drive the car this weekend at Dover.

Bobby Labonte (#77 Dollar General Chevy) is the only driver to claim championships in both series, but did so in different years. He won the NASCAR Busch Series title in 1991 and the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup crown in 2000. Kevin Harvick was the first to have the opportunity. The reigning series champion finished fourth in the Chase in 2006. Despite a stout lead in the driver point rankings, Edwards and his #60 Roush Fenway Racing team are seeking a slump-buster. Edwards hasn\ufffdt won since consecutive victories at Dover and Nashville Superspeedway in June. But he\ufffds back on concrete, a surface that has produced each of his four wins this year. In his last 13 races, Edwards has no wins and has finished 20th or worse six times although he bounced back with a second-place finish at Richmond International Raceway two weeks ago. He\ufffds failed to finish on the lead lap in four of the last six races. His team also is in a battle for the owner point crown with the #29 Richard Childress Racing Holiday Inn Chevy shared by Jeff Burton and Scott Wimmer. The #29 is 40 points up on the #60 heading to Dover. \u00a0 In The Loop:\u00a0 Ambrose Boasts Solid Numbers At Dover; Edwards, Wimmer Set For Showdown, 119471=Pre-Race Schedule: Friday \ufffd Practice, 9\ufffd10:10 a.m.; Rookie Practice, 10:20-10:50 a.m.; Final Practice, 1:50\ufffd3:00 p.m. Saturday \ufffd Qualifying, 12:05 p.m., 117938=The Race: RoadLoans.com 200 The Place: Dover International Speedway The Date:\u00a0 Sept. 22, 20071 The Time: 3:30 p.m. (ET) TV: ESPN2, 3:00 p.m. (ET) Track Layout: 1-mile oval Race Purse: $1,127,483 2006 Winner: Clint Bowyer 2006 Pole: Scott Riggs}",
