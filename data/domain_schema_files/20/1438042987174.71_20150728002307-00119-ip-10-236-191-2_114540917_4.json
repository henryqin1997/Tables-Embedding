A member of the 2004 Stanley Cup Champion Tampa Bay Lightning, Stillman also became just the second player in the history of the league to assist on Stanley Cup-clinching goals for two different teams (Bryan Trottier was the first, doing so with both the New York Islanders and the Pittsburgh Penguins). After missing the first 31 games of the 2006-07 regular season following shoulder surgery in the off-season, Stillman has had an impact on the score sheet in his first three games this season, registering three assists. The winger now has points in 16 of his last 18 games played dating back to Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the New Jersey Devils on May 14., 58040=CarolinaHurricanes.com is the official website of the Carolina Hurricanes.
