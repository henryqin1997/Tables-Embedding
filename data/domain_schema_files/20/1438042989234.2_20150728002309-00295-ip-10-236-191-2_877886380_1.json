Later, the 3270 PC/G (graphics) and 3270 PC/GX (extended graphics) followed., 78672=Addresses were encoded in orders in two bytes. For twelve bit addresses the high order two bits of each byte were normally set to form valid EBCDIC (or ASCII) characters. For example, address 0 was coded as X'4040', or space-space, address 1919 was coded as X'5D7F', or ')\"'.[2]:pp.75\u201390 Programmers hand coding panels usually kept the table of addresses from the 3270 Component Description or the 3270 Reference Card handy., 89331=This article is based on material taken from the Free On-line Dictionary of Computing prior to 1 November 2008 and incorporated under the \"relicensing\" terms of the GFDL, version 1.3 or later., 19590=Many manufacturers, such as Hewlett Packard, Memorex, ITT Courier and Teletype/AT&T created 3270 compatible terminals, or adapted ASCII terminals such as the HP 2640 series to have a similar block-mode capability that would transmit a screen at a time, with some form validation capability. Modern applications are sometimes built upon legacy 3270 applications, using software utilities to capture (screen scraping) screens and transfer the data to web pages or GUI interfaces., 77660=3270 displays and printers had a buffer containing one byte for every screen position. For example, a 3277 model 2 featured a screen size of 24 rows of 80 columns for a buffer size of 1920 bytes. Bytes were addressed from zero to the screen size minus one, in this example 1919. \"There is a fixed relationship between each ... buffer storage location and its position on the display screen.\"[2]:p.13 Most orders started operation at the \"current\" buffer address, and executing an order or writing data would update this address. The buffer address could be set directly using the Set Buffer Address (SBA) order, often followed by Start Field. For a device with a 1920 character display a twelve bit address was sufficient. Later 3270s with larger screen sizes used fourteen or sixteen bits., 1519=The IBM 3270 is a class of block oriented computer terminal (sometimes called display devices) made by IBM originally introduced in 1971[1] normally used to communicate with IBM mainframes. The 3270 was the successor to the IBM 2260 display terminal. Due to the text colour on the original models, these terminals are informally known as green screen terminals. Unlike a character-oriented terminal, the 3270 minimizes the number of I/O interrupts required by transferring large blocks of data known as data streams, and uses a high speed proprietary communications interface, using coaxial cable., 16459=Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) Mond Division's Works Records System, the first known shared public spreadsheet, used the 3270 successfully for what was, in effect, a high powered version of today's spreadsheets with additional functions. It remained in continual use for 27 years up until 2001 and, despite its lack of a GUI, cells can be defined anywhere on the screen (not necessarily in rows or columns) and can be instantly re-configured for length, content and formulas as required. It is interesting to note that ICI's online, fully interactive system pre-dated PC spreadsheets by quite a few years and allows multiple users to use the spreadsheets at the same time, similar to today's Web based shared spreadsheets., 26329=By 1994 the \"3174 Establishment Controller\" supported features such as attachment to multiple hosts via token ring, ethernet, or X.25 in addition to the standard channel attach or SDLC, and terminal attachment via twisted pair, token ring or ethernet in addition to co-ax. They also supported attachment of asynchronous ASCII terminals, printers, and plotters alongside 3270 devices.[4]}",

    "textBeforeTable": "The following table shows the 3275/3277/3284/3286 character set for US English EBCDIC. Lower case characters display or print as uppercase. NL, EM, DUP, and FM control characters display and print as 5, 9, *, and\u00a0; characters, respectively, except by the printer when WCC or CCC bits 2 and 3 = '00'b, in which case NL and EM serve their control function and do not print.[2]:p.15 Optional characters were available for US ASCII, and UK, French, German, and Italian EBCDIC. 3270 character set[edit] Technical Information[edit] Telnet 3270, or tn3270 describes both the process of sending and receiving 3270 data streams using the Telnet protocol and the software that emulates a 3270 class terminal that communicates using that process. tn3270 allows a 3270 terminal emulator to communicate over a TCP/IP network instead of an SNA network. Telnet 3270 can be used for either terminal or print connections. Standard telnet clients cannot be used as a substitute for tn3270 clients, as they use fundamentally different techniques for exchanging data. Telnet 3270[edit] The IBM 3270 display terminal subsystem was designed and developed by IBM's Kingston, NY, laboratory (which later closed during IBM's difficult time",
