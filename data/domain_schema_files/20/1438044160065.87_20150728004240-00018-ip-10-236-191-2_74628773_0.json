    "textAfterTable": "The Los Angeles Lakers have a straightforward chart to deal with.\u00a0 Barring any serious injuries four out of the five positions have solid starters.\u00a0 However, the aging Nash and Bryant may be rested more or less throughout the regular season.\u00a0 That leaves some openings for minutes at the one and two spot. Meeks has never really been a substantial threat or even a marginal sleeper throughout his career with the Sixers.\u00a0 I see him as much of the same on this squad.\u00a0 He may be useful for the odd three but the more athletic Goudelock may push for back-up minutes to Bryant. At the PG, Nash will be rested plenty throughout the regular season and that gives Blake some minutes to play with.\u00a0 However, Blake has really been the same old story in Los Angeles.\u00a0 He has had all the opportunity to shine but with a few young bodies in there, we may see him sparsely used.\u00a0 I\u2019d avoid him in most cases; unless you are completely desperate for a couple three pointers and decent percentages. Howard missed some time in Orlando last season and word out of camp has been good in terms",
