    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{510=Toyota reports a 12 percent increase, following a 15 percent gain in March. Deliveries at Volkswagen show a 27 percent gain for the group., 17114=GM deserves what it gets. This company had 29% in 2002 (famously) and 44% in 1980! They are lucky to hit 18% now. The reality is we spent a ton of money on bailouts only to see dealerships and brands shuttered. Product development has also been absurd. How can Cadillac, Buick and Chevy all not have full-size cars right now? This company knew what it was doing for so long (picking up market share in the 1970\u2019s even), but completely fell apart between 1980 and now. The Regal is an excellent car for instance but you cannot compete against Acura and BMW with such a shrunken dealer network and diversity of options., 183=Total sales rose 2 percent in April, the seasonally adjusted annual rate stands at\u00c2\u00a014.4 million, same as in March, and up from 13.1 million a year earlier., 1227=All results of April are in, and large parts of Detroit are unhappy. Sales of GM and Ford declined, the formerly torrid gains of Chrysler slowed down a bit. Reborn Toyota posted another double-digit gain and came within touching distance of outselling Ford, while Volkswagen continues its winning streak., 861=GM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s April sales dropped 8 percent, and Ford\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 5 percent, generally in line with analysts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 expectations. For Chrysler, analysts had expected a gain of 16 percent, Chrysler exceeded with 20 percent.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{135033=I don\u2019t think Toyota 12% gain is much, \u201cnews,\u201d given the fear in the market in 2009, the financial markets climate in April of 2010 and their massive production issues in April of 2011. Lexus remains flat after years of decline and Scion went backwards., 134561=Toyota\u2019s April 2011 sales were down 2.4% from April of 2010, so sayeth Toyota last year., 172907=The mystery drop is for the Fiesta which went from 9,147 in \u201911 to 5,135 in \u201912. With the rising gas prices this past month I would have expected that to be higher, but at least on my lot we suffered from a bad inventory mix \u2013 too many loaded models and not enough cheap entry level ones. I\u2019m seeing the people who were previously buying the loaded Fiestas now bumping themselves up to the Focus, where last April the new Focus wasn\u2019t out in large enough numbers to cannibalize Fiesta sales as much. The people going for Fiestas now are mainly doing it for pure price reasons, so my guess is Ford will switch production to more lower trim models to meet that demand. The Fiesta also had no incentives for much of April \u2013 no rebates and no finance deals that were better than what you could get from your bank with good credit, so that didn\u2019t help., 134744=Now a 2.4% decline may not seem so bad but lets remember, that YoY is against April of 2010, where you needed to know Jesus, personally, to get a new car loan and U6 unemployment was over 17%. Then lets go back one more year to April of 2009, during the heart of the UA witch hunt., 75540=Aside from overlooking the good news for Chrysler (still part of \u201cDetroit\u201d), TTAC overlooks the fact that Toyota\u2019s growth is in comparison to last April\u2019s post-tsunami nos. (while supply wasn\u2019t yet really an issue last April, Toyota did cut back on incentives which hampered sales)., 173811=Redesigned models for 2013 that were actually available on lots all did well and went up: Taurus, Flex, MKS, and MKT all saw increases. Recently refreshed or redesigned models like the Edge, Explorer, F-150, Focus, and MKX also had strong months. The word about the eminent arrival of the redesigned Fusion is out, but the Fusion also grew in sales this month., 73419=I am glad to see Toyota regaining some sales but against last years numbers from April onwards they should do., 76022=In addition, Toyota increased incentive spending over the previous month while GM and Ford cut back on incentive spending and in all likelihood, Toyota sold a significant no. to fleet (in March, 20% of Camrys went to fleet and the Corolla was a big fleet model as well) while GM and Ford having been cutting back on fleet., 93463=My 2011 Tundra was also recalled. It was recalled so they could put another sticker on it to lower the ratings. They downloaded the data from the OBDII port, read the O2 data and told me I did not need to use Premium gas in the 5.7. I told them it ran much better on Shell Premium gas. It\u2019s amazing what the OBDII data can tell them., 69935=Sure, Chrysler made huge gains \u2014 I own a 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Chrysler cannot build them fast enough \u2014 but the gains made by Toyota after the string of disasters far outweigh the gains made by Chrysler., 93811=My wife\u2019s 2008 Japan-built Highlander was also recalled and upon inspection it was found that it was not part of the recall after all. I think the dealer just wanted to download the data from the OBDII port since we never came in for routine service. I do all my own.}",
