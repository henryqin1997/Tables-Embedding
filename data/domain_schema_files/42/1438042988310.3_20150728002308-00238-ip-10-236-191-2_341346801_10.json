            "I have been looking for 'just the right shade of pink' .... and I finally found it. Not too light or too neon... soft and summery. Enjoy!",
            "I've tried so many brands searching for a pastel pink that doesn't make my nails look washed out. WIth its purple-y undertones this polish pops on my nails.",
            "I am obsessed with pastel pinks and have tried many brands including Essie, OPI, and Sally Henson. But this is the only one that doesn't blend into my skin and just look like an extension of my fingers. I can be tan or pale and this pink adds the perfect subtle pop of color to my nails. It has a mild purple undertone so no matter what your skin color it will stand out. Not only does it last all week, but it is definitely worth a try.",
