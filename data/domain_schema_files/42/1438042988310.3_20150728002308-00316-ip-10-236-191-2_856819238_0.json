He paid $2.00 for a general admission seat and kids got in for 50 cents. We would buy a bag of soft pretzels outside the stadium and bring them into the park. We\u2019d get a hot dog and soda for another $1. The entire outing to see a baseball game was about $5. Today, if I wanted to bring my family of five to a Phillies game at Citizen Bank Park (built for $458 million and paid for by the taxpayer) the lowest cost for the outing would be about $200. In 1971, you could spend a vacation week at the Jersey shore for $200. Now it gets you 3 hours of watching spoiled millionaires playing a child\u2019s game while sitting with a bunch of foul mouthed drunks., 36508=http://www.worldcomplex.blogspot.ca/2013/12/the-rise-of-virtual-economy-part-2.html, 23500=There are far more people going to college today than in 1971. With college tuition 1,500% higher, how can this not be reflected in the CPI? It certainly isn\u2019t because the education is better. Statistics show the uneducated poor are more likely to smoke. Lucky for them, cigarette prices have risen at a rate of 4 times CPI due to the government taxing the crap out of them to fund their various taxpayer boondoggles. Inflation always hurts the poor and enriches the peddlers of debt., 11104=The USD has lost 83% of its purchasing power since 1971. The moment Nixon began playing politics with the USD and bullied the Federal Reserve Chairman into pumping up the money supply prior to the 1972 election, the inflation genie got out of the bottle and led to the miserable stagflation of the 1970\u2032s. It took extreme measures by Paul Volcker to get it back under control in the early 1980\u2032s. Since Volcker we\u2019ve had nothing but academics and toadies who have chosen to change the definition of inflation in order to mislead the average American regarding how badly they are getting screwed. Every refinement, tweak, adjustment, or revision to the calculation of CPI has been designed to produce a lower figure. Why control inflation when you can just change the calculation to suit your purposes?, 67318=\"...the dollar itself. It has fallen to less than $0.05 of its 1913 value.\", 67199=\"The goods and services you could buy for $1.00 in 1913 now cost nearly $21.00.\", 7457=\u201cOne only needs to reflect on the dramatic decline in the value of the dollar that has taken place since the Fed was established in 1913. The goods and services you could buy for $1.00 in 1913 now cost nearly $21.00. Another way to look at this is from the perspective of the purchasing power of the dollar itself. It has fallen to less than $0.05 of its 1913 value. We might say that the government and its banking cartel have together stolen $0.95 of every dollar as they have pursued a relentlessly inflationary policy.\u201d - Ron Paul \u2013 End the Fed, 56200=Banks have grown their power over the last few decades in America to surpass the power of other corporations in industry, services and retail, their power now surpasses congress and the president, as the 2008 bailout proves beyond argument. Once their black mail worked in 2008, they have gone on to expand their power even more and to use the Federal Reserve as an agent of wealth Transfer., 22856=By the government\u2019s own measures, the average American\u2019s standard of living has fallen since 1971. But, we also know the government has been manipulating the CPI figure lower since the mid-1980\u2032s. After examining the true cost increases for housing, transportation, energy, food, education and entertainment, you would have to be brain dead or an Ivy League economist to believe inflation since 1971 has only been 473%. If home prices and car prices are 800% higher, while the energy needed to power and heat them are 900% to 1,000% higher, and the cost of food is 500% to 1,000% higher, how could the CPI only be 473% higher?, 49495=I know, it looks like the way to go, but the way to make money like a bankster is to capitalize on the time decay and the volatility decay.\u00a0 I've been watching the Facebook $60 January calls, 3 days ago the stock was at around 53 and the calls peaked at around 1.00 (in fairness, if you bought the dip you could have got them for around .70).\u00a0 Today the stocks' at 55 and the calls are - around 1.00.\u00a0 On the other hand, the $60 January puts peaked today at 6.85, last I checked end of day, they were at 5.40., 100552=Copyright \u00a92009-2013 ZeroHedge.com/ABC Media, LTD; All Rights Reserved. \u00a0Zero Hedge is intended for Mature Audiences.

The combination of the internet and memories from my youth provide a powerful and accurate assessment about the truthfulness of our government. I decided to create a chart of goods and services that average Americans have spent their hard earned wages on for decades. In a matter of minutes I was able to obtain prices from 1971 for various items common to most people. I was eight years old in 1971, being raised in a middle class one earner household on the salary of a truck driver. The chart below provides the proof the government CPI data is a bad joke and the American people are the butt of that joke., 8415=The BLS reported the CPI yesterday morning. They tell me that inflation is well contained and has only risen by 1.2% in the past twelve months. Our beloved Federal Reserve chairman is worried inflation is too low. It is fascinating that the only people worried about inflation being too low are Ivy League educated economists and bankers whose wealth depends upon the middle class sinking further into poverty. As a person who lives in the real world, I can honestly say I like it when the things I need to buy cost less today than they did last year. When did inflation become a good thing for the average American? Our country was somehow able to grow from a fledgling new country to a world power in just over a century while experiencing mild deflation, except during times of war. The fallacy that inflation is beneficial to the common man has been peddled by bankers since 1971 when Nixon and his cronies closed the gold window and unleashed the inflationary boogeyman in the form of feckless politicians, captured Keynesian academics, and greedy soulless bankers., 22199=The BLS tells me the CPI has risen by 473% since 1971. The very same agency also tells me average hourly earnings have risen by 464% since 1971. This means the average worker is earning less than they did in 1971 in real terms. The median wage per worker has lagged CPI dramatically, as the averages have been skewed by those making outrageous compensation in the financial world. Median household income has barely kept pace with inflation even though households were forced to send both parents into the workforce, with the expected consequences of higher divorce rates and children left to fend for themselves or be raised by strangers., 24799=I also found it fascinating that the most regressive tax on earth, the Social Security tax, which hammers the poor and middle class while leaving the rich virtually unscathed has gone up by 2,100% since 1971. The rate in 1971 was 5.2% and the maximum salary level was $7,800. Today, the rate is 7.65% and the maximum level is $113,700. This increased cost for every middle class American is not factored into the inflation figures. Why would the government need to increase the maximum taxable wages by 1,500% when wages have gone up by less than 500%? The hard working truck driver bears the full impact, while Jamie Dimon not so much., 26160=There are those who would blame the people who have chosen to live far beyond their means. They have a point. The American people certainly haven\u2019t shown a penchant for delayed gratification, saving for the future, or consuming less than they produce. But it takes two to tango and the lead in this dance of debt has been and continues to be the Federal Reserve and their Wall Street bank owners. It\u2019s always reasonable to ask \u2013 Who benefits? \u2013 when trying to figure out why something has happened over time. Did the American people benefit by increasing the debt owed to Wall Street banks from $650 billion in 1971 to $16.25 trillion today? I don\u2019t think so, based upon the visible deterioration I am witnessing in my suburban paradise., 89111=The best guess at true inflaton is shadowstats.com using the 1980 method which has inflation around 8% now. This is 1980 goverment methods so that is probably skewed too. Even though GDP is kind of a wild guess statistic Shadowstats has it at about -1\u00b78% now and it briefly peaked at -6% in 2009. There is no doubt the working man at all levels and the modestly capitalized ones too are feeling life stesses caused by declining personal wealth and diminished earning opportunities.}",
