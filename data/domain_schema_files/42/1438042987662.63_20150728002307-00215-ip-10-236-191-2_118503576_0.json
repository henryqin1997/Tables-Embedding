Kasey Kahne and Dale Earnhardt Jr. in 2008. And yeah, David, it still matters to be as high in the points as you can be, because of the tiebreaker. That's why Hamlin and Stewart are in pretty good shape, with the proviso that they score a win. Definitely, and the more Ragan runs well, the better his chances get., 30578=David Caraviello: That's true, Mark -- like Denny Hamlin in the Cup Series, he's been playing from behind for most of the year. But he also had made up enough ground to take over the points lead by Charlotte in May. So he made the climb, and now he's slipped back a little. I still think he has what it takes to catch and overtake Reed, but there are certainly no guarantees at this point.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Dave Rodman: I can tell you one thing for sure, this format has made the entire points table a lot more interesting. David Caraviello: Kenseth is not falling out of the top 10. Gordon's moving in the right direction. And I still think Hamlin is too good to be lollygagging around in 11th. That team has rebounded from an awful start and spent a lot of time making up ground, and I don't think they're done yet. Given that Denny is only three points out of 10th, if he does win again -- as Mark mentioned he might, and I don't disagree -- then he'll almost certainly move up enough in the process that he won't need the wild card, opening a space up for somebody else. Dave Rodman: I think Ragan has run well enough -- as he himself said at Daytona -- to be about 13th in the points. Despite what such notables as Kyle Busch and, I think, Denny Hamlin have said, I believe at this stage if you got two wins and were in the top 15, you'd be about a lock. Mark Aumann: Stewart's the guy who worries me the most. After giving away what appeared to be a sure victory at Las Vegas, he's really struggled to come close. And if he doesn't win a race, he may be on the outside looking in. Obviously, he's only four points out of 10th, but",
