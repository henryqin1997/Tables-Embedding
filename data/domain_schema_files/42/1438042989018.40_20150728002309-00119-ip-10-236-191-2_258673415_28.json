            "Analysis",
            "For the second straight week, the two-time defending champions were less than impressive. Nonetheless, Alabama eventually rolled to a 25-0 win at home against a ranked Ole Miss team. Don't let the final score fool you, the Tide struggled for the better part of three quarters against an upstart Rebel squad - and only led 6-0 at the half. But, when you're Alabama, style points don't matter - all that does is Nick Saban's squad is 4-0. I'll go ahead and pencil in a 5-0 start, as Alabama squares off against mighty Georgia State next weekend in Tuscaloosa.",
            "Clemson bounced back from a near scare against North Carolina State, and absolutely dominated Wake Forrest 56-7 at home. The Tigers looked like the #2 ranked team in the nation, and boy does that Georgia win look better and better each week. Clemson returned to the Boyd/ Watkins show. Tahj tallied 370 total yards and 4 TD's while Sammy Watkins grabbed 6 balls for 113 yards and a touchdown. Two more tune ups for the Tigers (at Syracuse & Vs Boston College) before the ACC showdown of the year against Florida State.",
            "It was wet and wild Saturday night at Autzen, but the Ducks passed their Pac-12 opener against Cal with flying colors, despite not being able to throw the football. Oregon only totaled 381 yards, by far their lowest of the season, but that was due to the monsoon like conditions. Two negatives came out of this game for the Ducks - Marcus Mariota's Heisman hopes took a hit (only 114 passing yards & 33 rushing) but maybe more important, De'Anthony Thomas left the game after injuring his ankle on the opening kickoff. Though all reports out of Eugene claimed that Thomas was smiling following the game, and expected to be OK. On the bright side for Oregon - they won't need DAT next weekend against Colorado.",
            "What's all this blowout stuff about, Stanford? After two disappointing close games against inferior opponents to open the year, Stanford has compiled back to back impressive victories. It wasn't close at the beginning and it wasn't close at the end, as the Cardinal rolled Washington State in Seattle 55-17. How's this for offensive balance: 322 yards through the air, 238 yards on the ground. Stanford is clicking on all cylinders, just in time to get some revenge from last season: Washington comes to the Farm Saturday night.",
            "It was a shaky start for the Seminoles on the road at Boston College, trailing 14-3 at the end of the 1st quarter. It was all Jameis Winston from then on out for the Seminoles, he tallied 330 passing yards and 4 TD's as Florida State outscored BS 45-20 for the 48-34 win. FSU has Maryland this weekend, before a week off to prepare for the real ACC Championship - at Clemson on October, 19th.",
            "Ohio State passed one of their \"tests\" Saturday night, though it wasn't easy. The Buckeyes held a 31-14 lead heading into the 4th quarter, but the Badgers made it intriguing before eventually falling 31-24. It's harder and harder to find a loss on Ohio State's schedule, and not because of their 5-0 start, but simply because of how dreadful the Big 10 is. Yet, another \"test\" looms for Ohio State in the form of undefeated Northwestern.",
            "Georgia is the prime example of why it's better to lose early, rather than late. The Bulldogs have survived arguably the toughest opening four-game stretch of any team in the nation - adding a 44-41 win over top-10 ranked LSU to their resume this weekend. And as a result, Mark Richt and co. find themselves right back in the National Title hunt. The best part of making it through this stretch with some life: Georgia only has one ranked team remaining on their schedule, Florida on November 2nd. SEC title game, here come the Bulldogs.",
            "Teddy Bridgewater's Heisman campaign was put on hold for the weekend, as the Cardinal had a bye on Saturday. They open AAC (your guess is as good as mine) this coming weekend, on the road against Temple.",
            "An absolute heartbreaker for Les Mile and LSU this weekend between the Hedges. Taking on a top-10 ranked Georgia team, the Bayou Bengals led 41-37 with 4:00 minutes remaining - but that proved to be too much time for Aaron Murray and the Bulldogs - who scored the winning touchdown with 1:47 left on the clock. Zach Mettenberger sure didn't disappoint; tossing 3 TD's along with 372 yards in a losing effort. The road map for LSU is clear - win out until November, 9th - when they travel to Tuscaloosa.",
            "The Bruins had the weekend off, in preparation for their Pac-12 opener Thursday night at Utah. UCLA is off to a fantastic start to the season, highlighted by a dominating win at Nebraska. Brett Hundley has been as good as advertised, tossing 8 TD's along with 848 yards through three games. They'll get a chance to prove themselves to the nation in three weeks (if they can survive Utah and Cal) when they get a rematch of the Pac-12 title game October 19th at Stanford.",
            "Whew. Connor Shaw went down early, and it looked like the Gamecocks season could be going up in flames when they trailed 10-0 at the half against Central Florida. But all is right in Steve Spurrior land, after 28 second half points led to a 28-25 win. South Carolina's schedule is the definition of manageable, starting with Kentucky and Arkansas in their next two games.",
            "The Canes' continued to make the case they're back as an elite program - this time routing South Florida 49-21 on the road Saturday. Miami didn't need much of Stephen Morris, because of the blowout, but he was impressive when in there: going 11 of 16 for 222 yards and 2 TD's. Next up for the \"U\" is Georgia Tech in Miami.",
            "It wasn't easy for Johnny Manziel and A&M, but they escaped Arkansas with a 45-33 win over the Razorbacks. Manziel was impressive as always, combining for 300+ total yards and 2 TD's. The Aggies have more in their corner than just Johnny Football, they also have a generous schedule. After a road tilt against Ole Miss this Saturday, A&M has five straight home games against unranked opponents.",
            "Oklahoma pulled off an impressive win on the road in South Bend, taking down the Irish 35-21. Blake Bell has looked impressive since taking over the starting QB job for the Sooners, throwing for 232 yards and 2 TD\u2019s. More importantly, Oklahoma played stout defense, forcing 3 turnovers and holding Notre Dame to 324 total yards. More winnable games loom for Bob Stoops; TCU and Texas are the next two opponents for the Sooners.",
            "It was a rainy, sloppy game for Washington \u2013 but they won their Pac-12 opener 31-13 over Arizona in Seattle. The game wasn\u2019t quite the blowout the final score would indicate \u2013 the Huskies led 11-6 at the half. Nonetheless, we\u2019ll finally find out what Washington is all about the next two weeks. Starting Saturday, when they travel down to the Farm to take on Stanford; then welcome the Ducks to the renovated Husky stadium. Safe to say, splitting these next two would be a huge success for the Dawgs.",
            "The Wolverines had the weekend off, and boy did they need it. Back to back scares against Akron and Uconn will send you back to the drawing board. The beauty for Brady Hoake and Michigan \u2013 the Big 10 is terrible. Three \u201cshould\u201d win games loom; Vs Minnesota, at Penn State and at home against Indiana.",
            "The Gators played their first full game without Jeff Driskel behind center, and luckily for them it was against Kentucky. The final score was 24-7, but something tells me Florida won\u2019t around in the top-25 much longer. How\u2019s this for a stacked deck on the remaining schedule; LSU, Georgia, South Carolina and Florida State.",
            "How good is Baylor? Well, no one really knows. They\u2019ve rolled their first three opponents, looking like an absolute offensive juggernaut\u2026 But the schedule has been easier than apple pie. Next for the Bears is West Virginia, which is a game they should win, but the Mountaineers looked impressive taking down Oklahoma State this past weekend.",
            "Everything said about Baylor\u2019s schedule also applies to Northwestern. Their marquee win? California. We\u2019ll settle the dispute of how mediocre this team actually is after Saturday night \u2013 when Ohio State comes to town.",
            "Welp, safe to say no one saw this coming. A week after West Virginia was boat raced by Maryland (yes, the Terrapins) they knocked off the 11th ranked Cowboys. Kansas State comes to town this weekend, which should provide an opportunity for a bounce back win.",
            "Texas Tech is off to a 4-0 start under new head coach Kliff Kingsbury, and it should be a 5-0 start. Kansas comes to town to Lubbock this weekend.",
            "If I told you a loss to Arizona State would mark the end for Lane Kiffin, you probably wouldn\u2019t have believed me. But that\u2019s precisely what happened Saturday night in Tempe; the Sun Devils rolled all over the Trojans to the tune of 62 points. It was a nice bounce back win for ASU, who get another intriguing matchup this weekend in the form of Notre Dame.",
            "The Bulldogs can put up points with the best of them, and did so again against Hawaii this weekend. Off to a 4-0 start with the younger Carr brother, Fresno likely won\u2019t be tested the rest of the season.",
            "The last time I saw Northern Illinois, they were getting boat raced by Florida State in the Orange Bowl. They reappeared on my radar this weekend, rolling Purdue on the road 55-24. Is there another BCS appearance in their future? The answer could easily be yes; the toughest opponent remaining on their schedule is Central Michigan.",
            "For lack of better options, Nebraska poked its head back in the top-25 after a bye week. The Huskers get Illinois this weekend."
