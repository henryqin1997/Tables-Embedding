    "textAfterTable": "Shved's new haircut = speed. Our Wolves are winning early in the year with a combination of solid defense, timely runs and the benefit of playing mostly crappy teams.\u00a0 While Orlando, Brooklyn, Toronto and Sacramento isn't a murderers row, there are 8 new Timberwolves playing significant minutes that were not on the team last year.\u00a0 This is a testament to how well Rick Adelman can coach.\u00a0 I've seen a dozen different lineups, often with 5 non-starters in together;\u00a0 and yet they still play solid basketball.\u00a0 The one thing that has gotten out of hand at times is the turnovers.\u00a0 For some, like Shved, I'll chalk it up to nerves and for others I'll chalk it up to growing pains as they learn the offense and each other.\u00a0 Shved can play, by the way.\u00a0 Another nice scoop up for our guy KAHN. Some tough games are on the horizon:\u00a0 Friday vs Indiana, Saturday @Chicago and Monday @Dallas.\u00a0 They could easily drop all three of those games against 3 likely playoff-bound squads. In fact, over the next 15 games only 5 look like cupcakes.\u00a0 My hope was and remains that we are no worse than a few games under .500 by the time Love",
