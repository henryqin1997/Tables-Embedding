It\u2019ll also take Wichitans to three busy points on Southwest\u2019s system: No. 1 Las Vegas, No. 2 Chicago and No. 7 Dallas in terms of daily departures. We\u2019ll note that that\u2019ll be a substantial increase in capacity as AirTran\u2019s three flights with 117-seat Boeing 717s will be replaced with five flights provided by Boeing 737, which have 137 seats, 143 seats if converted to the new seating or 175 seats if it\u2019s a Boeing 737-800. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is fantastic news for Wichita and the state of Kansas,\u201d Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback said.\u00a0 \u201cSouthwest Airlines will contribute significantly to our quality of life in Kansas and to our economy statewide.\u00a0 Affordable flights and flight choices are essential for keeping the cost of business competitive and having Southwest at Mid-Continent Airport makes south central Kansas more accessible to the rest of the country.\u00a0 We can\u2019t wait to book our flight!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that they\u2019ll be continuing our history of providing low air fares in this region. The presence of Southwest Airlines will benefit both business and leisure travelers and will support our collaborative efforts to retain and create jobs. It\u2019s going to be great to have the Southwest Airlines reputation and brand at our airport, especially when our new terminal opens!\u201d the mayor said. \u201cI\u2019m",
