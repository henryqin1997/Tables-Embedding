While no relationship was observed with negative affect, we found that latency in the fearful expression condition was positively correlated with the scores on the Fear scale (r\u2009=\u2009.516, p\u2009=\u2009.012)., 21583=Twenty-six infants (15 boys, 11 girls) with no history of perinatal or postnatal difficulties were recruited through local maternity groups in Nagoya, Japan\u2019s third largest metropolitan area, located near the center of the country. Criteria for participation in the study were no known complications of birth or other causes, having been carried to full term (more than 37\u2009weeks gestation), and normal birth weight (2500\u2009g\u20134000\u2009g). The infants were longitudinally assessed four times (at 12, 18, 24, and 36\u2009months of age) through eye movement recordings and behavior questionnaires filled out by their caregivers. All caregivers were Japanese mothers who gave informed consent on behalf of their infants before the experiments. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Nagoya City University (No. 07007) and accorded with the ethical standards specified in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. One participant at 18\u2009months, four at 24\u2009months, and one at 36\u2009months of age could not participate in the experiments for personal reasons (e.g., birth of a sibling or father\u2019s work reassignment)., 81431=\u00a9 2009-2015 BioMedSearch.com.
