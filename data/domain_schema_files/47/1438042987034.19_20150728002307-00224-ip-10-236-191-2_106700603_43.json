For each year the student teaches in the eligible school district, 50% of the loan is forgiven.

The maximum scholarship for first year students in 1997-98 was $2,250. This maximum went into effect for first time recipients in 1996-97. The maximum scholarship for all other students was full tuition and fees at a UW campus or Wisconsin Technical College, or an amount equal to the UW - Madison tuition and fees for the students attending independent institutions in Wisconsin. Half of the scholarship is funded by the state, while the other half is matched by the institution., 115122=October 1998 Board Meeting Agenda \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 October 1998 Meeting Minutes \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Board Reports Index, 11396=Dependent students attending University of Wisconsin institutions in 1997-98 expended the majority of the funds available (over 43%).
