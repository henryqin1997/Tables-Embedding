Vehicle/Beast Features Opening Cockpit, Astromech Droid Port, Wings Open and Close, Retractable Landing Gear Notes The X-Wing Starfighter was released in several, slightly different, versions. Each version was a different squad number, designated by the number of red stripes found on either wing, and came with a different set of figures. \u00a0 The original Series Alpha release had several minor paint variations, the most obvious one being white bands painted around the X-Wing's engines. Later releases did not include the white paint. The Red 5 X-Wing was also sold as a mail order item through Avon. \u00a0 Have something to contribute to this page? Send me",
