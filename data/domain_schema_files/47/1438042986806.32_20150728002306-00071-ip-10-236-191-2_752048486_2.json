We have not at present tested all of these plugins and players, and would be happy to hear of users' experiences with them. Plugins We recommend FreeWRL for use on a Mac. Safari for Mac In contrast to Firefox, IE works great with Cortona and Octaga's most recent versions. Internet Explorer for Windows Cortona worked great in previous versions of Firefox, but with Firefox 3.0 it caused any pages with VRMLs to crash the entire browser. Octaga 2. 3 and 2.2 both crash Firefox as well. At this point Firefox itself seems defective and we can only recommend not using Firefox 3.0 for viewing VRMLs. Firefox for Windows If the frame on the left does not load the entrance to the monastery (give it some time if you have a slow connection - this is a whole monastery!), you probably need to install a viewer - see below for links.
