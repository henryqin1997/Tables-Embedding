The game's return was finalized in 2009 when the NFL and Hawaii Tourism Authority came to an agreement on a two-year deal in which the HTA pays $4 million a game and $145,000 for game-day operations for this year's event. The Pro Bowl's long-term future in Honolulu is also in doubt. The mood in the days leading up to the game has been generally light, although the league's labor issues and the threat of a lockout next season linger on the horizon. \"The third (and) fourth quarter it picks up,\" Peterson said. \"Guys really start playing. You can definitely tell the difference.\" While staying healthy remains a priority, Peterson \u2014 a Pro Bowl pick each of his four years in the league and MVP of the 2008 game \u2014 said he can sense an up-tick in intensity as the winner's check comes into view. The offenses have a few light practices to get on the same page of a simplified playbook. But limitations placed on the defenses in terms of coverages and blitzing tend to turn Pro Bowls into fan-pleasing shootouts. \"Coach Belichick said",
