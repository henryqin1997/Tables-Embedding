Check below to see how we all picked, tune into ABC Thursday at 9:00 to check out Game 1, and stay tuned for the results of this year\u2019s NBA Playoffs Pick \u2018Em. In addition to picking the MVP of the series, and Kobe\u2019s total points throughout the series (as a tiebreaker), all point values have been doubled. That means picking the series winner is worth four points, while the series length and MVP are worth two points. Kobe\u2019s scoring total is for tiebreaking purposes only. Most of us here at SoB are taking the home team (duh) to win it all, behind the leadership of Rajon Rondo, though Ray Allen is also poking his nose into our MVP debate. For the two of us taking the Lakers, Kobe Bryant was an easy choice for MVP. It\u2019s also shaping up to be a long series, with nobody thinking it\u2019ll go less than six games. Together, we\u2019re thinking Bryant will garner about 168 points throughout the series. Well, here we are. It\u2019s the 12th meeting between Boston and (Beat) L.A. in the Finals. 32 of 63 (>50%) of all NBA titles ever belong to one of the two teams. And with the trash talking by both Boston and Los Angeles beginning in full, it\u2019s sure to be a huge four to seven games. Hopefully, concussions and backs won\u2019t be an issue for the Celtics;",
