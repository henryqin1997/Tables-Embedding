This year the company will begin building a new Dreamliner, the larger 787-9, with plans to test-fly it by year's end. Meanwhile, Boeing will work closely with customers \"to continue defining the 787-10X and 777X,\" Conner said. Both are aircraft that Boeing has yet to offer to customers. Boeing's jet backlog, which increased to 4,373 unfilled requests at the end of 2012, is the highest in history. That means the company will need to \"focus on raising production rates and continuously improve how we build airplanes,\" Conner said. As the company looks ahead in 2013, Boeing has \"to step up its game even more,\" Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing for commercial airplanes, wrote Thursday on his blog. Shanahan said he remains upbeat about the 787 program, despite initial production difficulties and a rate-increase challenge. The 787 \"is going to carry this company for many years to come,\" he said. \"We know we need to investigate those things,\" Shanahan said. \"We've got to improve the reliability.\" Boeing has delivered 49 787s to eight customers since late 2011, when the first planes were ready. Of late, though, the Dreamliner has made headlines for mechanical troubles more than for new deliveries",
