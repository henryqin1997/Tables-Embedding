    "textAfterTable": "Comment This case demonstrates how significant hepatic fibrosis and portal hypertension can arise during methotrexate therapy without accompanying symptoms or significant elevations in serum aminotransferase levels.\u00a0 Also characteristic was the mild and nonprogressive nature of the cirrhosis despite continuation of methotrexate.\u00a0 A possible noninvasive marker for the development of significant fibrosis in this case was the decrease in platelet count, which fell from 181,000/\u03bcL at baseline to 105,000 \u03bc/L one year later\u2013a 47% decline and a \u201cplatelet slope\u201d of -74,000/year.\u00a0 In analyses of serial platelet count determinations in patients who developed portal hypertension, a platelet slope of -9,000/year was found to be indicative of the development of portal hypertension and hepatic dysfunction.\u00a0 Whether leflunomide contributed to the toxicity of methotrexate is not clear, but the findings are compatible with the duration and total dose of methotrexate received.\u00a0 The patient did not have typical risk factors for developing methotrexate related fibrosis such as excessive alcohol use, underlying viral hepatitis, renal insufficiency or diabetes (no mention is made of body weight or presence of obesity).\u00a0 While this patient did not qualify for undergoing surveillance liver biopsies (according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology), noninvasive tests such as PIIIP, hepatic imaging or elastography would have been appropriate and would likely have suggested the presence of significant fibrosis much earlier. \u00a0 Top of page PRODUCT INFORMATION Methotrexate REPRESENTATIVE",
