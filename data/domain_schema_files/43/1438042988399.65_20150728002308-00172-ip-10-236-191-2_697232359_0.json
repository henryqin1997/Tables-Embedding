The Lee-Landry lineup is a problem for opponents, because both can score or initiate the offense in the post area. But the duo also leaves something to be desired on the defensive end and in rebounding against bigger front lines. It will be up to the coaches to pick the right times to mix and match the lineups. Jackson says he'll start a conventional lineup - meaning rookie center Festus Ezeli will get the nod if Bogut can't play - but Landry might finish the game. The minutes and position are still a question with the Warriors. Landry is naturally a power forward, but with Bogut still questionable for the season opener, Jackson has toyed with playing Lee and Landry at the same time. \"I've been on a lot of teams that had a ton of individual talent, but couldn't quite win as a team,\" the 6-9, 248-pound 29-year-old said. \"I'm past that point of my career. I have the mind-set that, no matter how many minutes you play and no matter what position you play, it's all about",
