Click here to see our full range Most tables come with 48\" cues as standard, but should you want longer or shorter cues, the recommended room size changes accordingly. If there is the odd tight spot in your particular room, this is quite normal and we do provide half size cues in these circumstances. Snooker Table 12ft - full tournament sized snooker table. Snooker Table 10ft - a smaller sized snooker table where space is limited. American 9ft - considered to be the full sized American table. American 8ft - a slightly smaller version of the American table popular in the UK. British 7ft - full size as played in pool leagues. British 6ft - often found in pubs and homes where space is a bit tight. As a rule of thumb, we suggest allowing 5ft of cueing room around each side of your table. You can use our sizing chart below as a quick",
    "textAfterTable": "Video Transcription (from above): The best way to describe how much cueing room you're going to need around your table is to work using the play surface of the table as your main guide. Now, on slate bed tables when you're looking at a 7 foot by 4 foot table, that is discussing the overall length and width of the table. However, when you take off the rails at the side of the table and also the cushions, you then end up having about a foot less on the actual play surface, and it's at this point we need to measure from, because it's at that point that the first part of the tip of the cue will be striking the ball. So if you're looking at a 7 foot by 4 foot table, we'd normally take off a foot off the length and a foot off the width, so take it down as a 6 foot by 3 foot play surface. We'd recommend about 5 feet worth of cueing room around each edge. So down the length of the table, you'll take 5 foot, then the length of the play surface, which is 6 foot, then 5 foot again, which totals 16 feet. On the width, it's the same, 5 foot, but this time 3 foot across for the play surface and then another 5 foot the other side, giving you a total of 13 feet. Now",
