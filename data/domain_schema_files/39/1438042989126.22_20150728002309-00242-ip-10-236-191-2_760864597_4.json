Binghamton lost its first 26 games last season, but there is a glimmer of hope this time around. A new coach (Dempsey spent the last seven years at Rider in the MAAC) brings a new attitude. Binghamton already has lost 6-foot-4 guard Robert Mansell (knee) for the year; he hurt himself against UAlbany on Feb. 23. Senior guard Jimmy Gray (8.4 ppg) is the leading returning scorer. Binghamton fans do have one thing going for them: The Events Center is the best arena in the league., 14743=Platform: The season started out weird for the Retrievers, who got a new coach right before practice started. Aki Thomas, who has been an assistant in Baltimore for the past five seasons, took over Oct. 10, after longtime coach Randy Monroe resigned (or was he fired?). UMBC won four games a year ago, but it does have more returning players (11) than any team in the league. Chase Plummer, a 6-6 junior who scored 15.4 points per game last year, will be a handful every night. Two other double-digit scorers \u2014 senior Ryan Cook (12.5 ppg) and senior Ryan Neller (11.4 ppg) \u2014 also are returning for the Retrievers., 15922=Platform: Nine letter-winners and three starters are back for the Wildcats, who tied for fifth in the league last season, their best finish since 2009. New Hampshire's defense was stingy, holding opponents to 62.8 points per game, third best in the league. Senior Chandler Rhoads, a 6-4 senior guard, averaged 11.2 points and was an America East All-Defensive selection. The biggest loss is guard Alvin Abreu, who averaged 13.5 points his senior year and finished with 1,564 for his career.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "2011-12 returns Platform: After going to the NCAA Tournament last year and winning 20 games for the ninth time in 11 years, Vermont was expected to keep rolling. Then things sort of unraveled as Four McGlynn, the second-leading scorer on the team as a freshman (11.8 ppg) left school, and Brendan Bald (7.6 ppg) decided he didn't want to play anymore. Also, leading scorer Matt Glass (11.9 ppg) graduated. Luke Apfeld, who scored 10 points per game as a sophomore, will have to pick it up, and the Cats still have rugged 6-6 forward Brian Voelkel, who led the league in rebounding (8.5 rpg) and was second in assists (5.1 apg). Campaign slogan: \"We can reload\" Coach: John Becker (24-12, 1 year) Vermont Catamounts Platform: The past two seasons, Stony Brook made it to the America East championship game. Both times, the Seawolves lost. Last year, they lost to Vermont on their home floor; the year before they lost at Boston University. The Seawolves have won the league's regular-season championship two of the past three years. For Stony Brook to get a spot in the title game this year, the Seawolves are going to have to get a big season out of 6-5 senior forward Tommy Brenton, who averaged 7.8 points and 8.1 rebounds. Stony Brook lost",
