Much better measures are complexity metrics, which, for example, count the number and size of if-then-else blocks, or the number and size of all blocks, or the number of math operators per statement. Maybe someday we'll run one of those tools on this code. For now, this is what we have. On the other hand, we've attempted to count only those files that contain human-edited code, that is, files that are directly edited by humans. The point of doing this is to avoid artificially inflating the KLOC counts by counting automatically generated code (which is why the glade files are not counted: they are large and automatically generated). The table below shows some historical lines-of-code and number-of-files metrics for the GnuCash development project. Note that not all of the code is counted: for instance, the Makefiles and configure.in and autogen.sh are not counted. Also, files that are automatically generated are not counted, nor are files that have been 'borrowed' from other projects. Also not counted are experimental files, miscellaneous perl scripts, various converters, addons and utilities. Finally, glade files are not counted, although large parts of the overall GUI are described in glade files. Given that we have about 400 outstanding bugs in bugzilla, that works out to about one bug per thousand",

If there is only one number in the parenthesis, it is the approriate KLOC count for that statistic. where KLOC == kilo-lines-of-code, as reported by wc. As noted above, wc is not a terribly good code metric, but its what we have handy. Table Column Legend engine Contents of the src/engine and the include directories.

The data storage backend (file-io, sql) was split out in the course of version 1.5 backend Contents of the src/backend directory (version 1.7 and later) or of src/engine/file, src/engine/sql (version 1.6 and earlier) register Contents of the src/register directory (version 1.6 and earlier) or src/register/register-core (version 1.7 and later). The register was split out as a separate component from the motif code in version 1.1. As can be seen from the stats, the register code has been fairly stable.
