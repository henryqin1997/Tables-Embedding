Probably more because at this track the aero advantage of the top teams counts for more (tough I do now see that the fastest quali times of the top 10 were well within 0.7s in Hungary)., 28721=AndrewTanner (@andrewtanner) said on 21st September 2012, 18:19, 66559=HUHHII (@huhhii) said on 21st September 2012, 20:46, 24054=And 4th in 2008, when Raikkonen hit the wall chasing him., 30227=electrolite (@electrolite) said on 22nd September 2012, 0:12, 23648=David-A (@david-a) said on 21st September 2012, 17:59, 44317=cg22me (@cg22me) said on 21st September 2012, 20:03, 60079=AndrewTanner (@andrewtanner) said on 21st September 2012, 18:28, 27095=OOliver said on 21st September 2012, 17:43, 63306=M30 said on 22nd September 2012, 1:11, 19108=sushant.008 said on 21st September 2012, 16:40, 64772=raymondu999 (@raymondu999) said on 21st September 2012, 19:23, 41065=cg22me (@cg22me) said on 21st September 2012, 18:01, 31769=M30 said on 21st September 2012, 16:47, 48106=bosyber (@bosyber) said on 21st September 2012, 17:41, 20495=dennis (@dennis) said on 21st September 2012, 16:54, 12237=Read more: 2012 F1 practice results | 2012 F1 season | 2012 Singapore Grand Prix, 42652=AndrewTanner (@andrewtanner) said on 21st September 2012, 18:25, 46237=Paul A (@paul-a) said on 21st September 2012, 17:26, 55139=davidnotcoulthard said on 22nd September 2012, 0:50, 38032=Tango (@tango) said on 21st September 2012, 16:55, 21960=91jb12 (@91jb12) said on 21st September 2012, 17:56, 56604=raymondu999 (@raymondu999) said on 22nd September 2012, 3:40, 34690=Theo1 said on 21st September 2012, 20:00, 25359=Dan Brown (@danbrown180) said on 21st September 2012, 17:27}",
    "textBeforeTable": "the other Lotus of Kimi Raikkonen developed an hydraulic problem and he had to pit during his high-fuel run at the end of the session. The Force India pair of Paul di Resta and Nico Hulkenberg were sixth and seventh, followed by Nico Rosberg, Felipe Massa and the returnign Romain Grosjean. Kamui Kobayashi spun at turn 18 as the session was coming to an end and had to reverse back to turn 19 so he could get going again. A few other drivers had moments during the session, including Narain Karthikeyan who thumped the kerbs hard at turn ten. Bruno Senna caused a brief stoppage in the session after clipping the barrier at turn 19. He spun to a halt at turn 20 and practice had to be red-flagged so it could be recovered. The other McLaren of Lewis Hamilton had set the pace earlier one, but Hamilton lost time by running wide at the final corner. His lap was beaten by Mark Webber and then Fernando Alonso. The Red Bull driver was one of the last to do a time on the super-soft tyre and set a time over three-tenths of a second quicker than Jenson Button. Sebastian Vettel stayed on top in the second practice session ahead of the Singapore",
