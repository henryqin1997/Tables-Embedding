A team is picked out of a hat and chooses their draft spot live on the air, usually providing a brief explanation. Last year we picked 12th out of 13 teams and tabbed Buster Posey as our first pick, causing a bit of a stir. We followed with Justin Upton, once again demonstrating you don\u2019t win a league with your first couple of picks., 95599=\u00a9 2015 MASTERSBALL. Partner of USA TODAY Sports Digital Properties. All Rights Reserved., 28866=2. Health - I just get done convincing myself to give Troy Tulowitzki nearly regular at bats the rest of the way and he reminds me why I hedged back in the spring. As will be discussed in a minute, upside is a consideration and some perennially injured players have significant upside, but the replacement pool for injured players is much weaker than it was in May. Be judicious with where you hang your hat., 29603=4. Streaks - Riding the hot hand is fine, but not at the expense of a better player. There may be some new research that suggests streaks are real but regardless. what goes up must come down. Again - context - if you need to take a chance then riding the August/September version of Chris Colabello may be the play. But take a look above, where's Colabello? The talk of the early season didn't make the top-20 lists through May. So sure, play a hot guy and bench someone else but have a very short leash. Don't drop a better player for a hot player. Someone else in your league will pick up the dropped player and benefit while you're trolling the wire to replace the now cold player., 45529=As many of you know, I contribute content for ESPN Fantasy Baseball. I was recently tasked with generating my top-250 starting from May 16 through the end of the season. What\u2019s done is done. The instructions were to rank performance going forward. My rankings, to put it kindly, caused quite a stir. So much so, in fact, that a reader felt compelled to honor me with a troll Twitter account dedicated to my stupidity., 56967=What's good for the goose is good for the gander. I\u2019m perfectly fine if I end up with goose egg all over my face come September when Jay Bruce is hitting .260 with his usual 30 HR., 2351=Don't look now but teams have played at least 100 games. That leaves fewer than 60 for most clubs. What we're going to do is look at the leaders in the standard hitting categories through May since that matches the time we have left this season. The reason for this is two-fold. First, you're reminded that there will be some surprises in the coming weeks - there always are. Second, you have a reasonable expectation what the best players may produce for the rest of the season so you can be practical and reasonable in your evaluations.}",
