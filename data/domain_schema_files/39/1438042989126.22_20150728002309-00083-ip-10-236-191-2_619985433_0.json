A discussion and critical appraisal of each system will occur based on a model for evaluation and validation of manipulative therapy. Emphasis will be on the developer of each technique, the biomechanical principles upon which it is based, and how patients are evaluated and treated using the technique. The current research status of each technique will also be discussed. Clearly, this is not a \"how to\" hands on practical class. Rather it is designed to present the information known about some of the more common and not-so-common techniques used by doctors of chiropractic. Foundational information will be presented on the rationale for manipulative procedures in their various forms as well as the lesion they target. 37030:PRINCIPLES AND PHILOSOPHY 3",
