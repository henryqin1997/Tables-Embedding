    "textBeforeTable": "You can now choose from 5 different \u201cSimplicity for iPhone\u201d tariffs which all including unlimited texts. Each tariff is available on either a 1-month rolling contract or a 12 month contract. There is a \u00a35/month discount for the 12 month contract. What tariffs are available? Simplicity for iPhone is a SIM-only tariff for your iPhone. SIM only tariffs are contracts which only provide you with airtime and do not provide you with a free phone. They offer good savings (about \u00a3180/year) to people who already have their own iPhone and have completed the original contract length. It\u2019s also ideal if you\u2019ve purchased a second hand iPhone or had one handed onto you. Yesterday we were the first to bring you news of the updates to O2\u2019s iPhone tariff and the incorporation of \u201cunlimited\u201d texts onto their iPhone tariffs. O2 have today announced a much larger range of \u201cSimplicity for iPhone\u201d tariffs which are all available online. This includes a \u00a315/month tariff which is the cheapest iPhone tariff to date. O2 are offering a range of \u201cSimplicity\u201d tariffs for iPhone users from \u00a315/month with 300 minutes, unlimited texts and internet. photo: Jeff Kubina //--> google_ad_height = 280; google_ad_width = 336; google_ad_slot = \"4841035901\"; /* Blog Top: Square */ google_ad_client =",
    "textAfterTable": "All of the tariffs include visual voicemail. We think that the \u00a315/month iPhone tariff (300 minutes, unlimited texts, unlimited web and wi-fi, visual voicemail) on 12 months is a real highlight \u2013 certainly the cheapest iPhone tariff on the market. Which tariff should I choose? photo: Jeff Kubina The right tariff for you would depend on how many minutes you regularly use. Once you\u2019ve used your inclusive airtime, it will cost 20p/minute to make a phone call so costs can quickly add up. Make 400 minutes of phone calls on a 300-minute tariff for example and you would end up paying \u00a340 that month (\u00a320 for the base tariff plus \u00a320 for calls). It is often better to choose a tariff with more minutes than you require than to exceed your airtime allowance regularly. Another important decision is whether to go with the 1 month rolling contract or the 12 month contract. The 12-month contract has a \u00a35/month discount. If you\u2019re looking to upgrade to the iPhone 4 in the next 12 months, you may be better off with the 1-month rolling contract. How much money will I save by switching to \u201cSimplicity for iPhone\u201d? Typically, about \u00a315/month or \u00a3180 per year providing you are happy to sign the 12-month contract. For example, you might currently be on the old \u00a335/month iPhone",
