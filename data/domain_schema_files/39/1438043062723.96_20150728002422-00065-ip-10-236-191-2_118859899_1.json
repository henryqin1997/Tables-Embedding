These should be posted as a pdf in the Notes column of the table below by the Monday evening before you present. If you don't know how to post them, send them to me (by Sunday evening so that I can get them up by Monday). (ii) A 5-10 min summary of a recent paper (last ~3 years) from the primary literature that is relevant to your topic and specifically addresses conservation in urban settings (rather than simply urban ecology). Others are not expected to read this paper, so you must given enough detail for them to understand the main points. You must, however, send a pdf to me (Chris) before 5 pm on the Sunday before your presentation. AGAIN, THE TIME LIMIT WILL BE ENFORCED. (i) A 5-10 minutes introduction to the material presented in your chapters (see below for more guidance). Everyone is expected to read the assigned chapters and any associated section intros/conclusions. THE TIME LIMIT WILL BE ENFORCED - PRACTICE YOUR PRESENTATION When it is your turn to present, you should prepare: A tentative schedule is posted below. Everyone should sign up to lead the discussion one week (see next section for tips on leading effectively).

    "textAfterTable": "Expectations Here are some general comments about my expectations for the class. Exact details will vary depending on the semester's topic. Generally we will read papers or have presentations and discuss them in class each week. Most discussions will be led by students, and everyone is expected to sign up to lead at least one discussion. The schedule is posted above. Discussion leaders: Generally, my expectation is that you will present a 5-10 minute (NO MORE!) introduction to the topic. Your introduction should draw on the readings, but should not simply re-state what we have all read. Simply reiterating what the readings say is boring and doesn't accomplish much. Instead, your job as leader is to get a discussion going. This is hard (and I will help), but far more interesting for everyone involved. Here are some tips: Make sure that you have enough to say to keep things moving, but do not feel that you have to say everything that you have thought of or cover every idea in the readings. If the conversation is going well, just let it take its course. The worst thing that can happen is that no one says anything. The next worst thing is that the leader completely dominates the conversation (I can be guilty of this sin myself, so feel free to cut me off if I'm talking too much). In your introduction, try to synthesize the material",
