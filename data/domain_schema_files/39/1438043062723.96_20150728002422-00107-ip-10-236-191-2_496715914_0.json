The Hornets (5-7-4, 3-3-2 Big Sky) will close out their Big Sky schedule against the first-place Vikings (7-7-2, 5-2-1) at 1 p.m. on\u00a0Friday before playing a non-league game to finish off the 2012 regular season against the Spartans (4-10-1, 2-4 WAC) at 1 p.m. on\u00a0Sunday. TOURNAMENT\u00a0IMPLICATIONS Sacramento\u00a0State is currently tied for sixth in the conference standings and only the top four teams advance to the Big Sky Tournament. The Hornets and Vikings each close out their conference schedule on Friday, while Northern Colorado, Idaho\u00a0State, Montana and Weber State - the four teams ahead of Sacramento State in the standings - all have two league games remaining. All four of those teams have four conference wins and of the group, the Hornets only hold the tiebreaker with Montana after beating the Griz 2-0 on Sept. 30. The Hornets cannot catch Portland State or Northern Colorado in the standings but the final two seeds are within reach. If the Hornets lose at Portland State, they will be elimated from conference tournament contention. If they win, they will need Montana to lose at least once followed by either one or two losses by Idaho State, Weber State and/or Northern Arizona. Sacramento\u00a0State needs help to get into the tournament, but it all starts with a win at Portland State on Friday afternoon.
