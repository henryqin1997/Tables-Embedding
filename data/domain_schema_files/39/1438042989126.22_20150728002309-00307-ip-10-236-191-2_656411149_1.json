    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{47316=The women have been putting up some impressive scores too- Rosibel threw down a 5:33 static, which is an easy one for her! Jen reached a new personal best and keeps impressing everyone as she pushes those numbers deeper and deeper. Junko turned a bit early, but after announcing that she\u2019s sending her monkeys back to Japan via Fedex Express, we\u2019re sure she\u2019s going to hit it hard next time! Ashley had a little trouble with a squeeze on her 61m dive, but since she\u2019s already done that depth in the past she\u2019ll rock it on Thursday. Francesca did her first competition dive today and got her first white card in the ocean! I had a good dive today too after flubbing my surface protocol on my 63m dive yesterday- the judges were laughing as I VERY deliberately went through the protocol today., 80435=So we\u2019ve just started training now and many of the competitors have arrived already. Junko Kitahama (Japan) showed up early and opened up the condos for us. Kirk, Mandy and Kaila Krack (the youngest freediver we\u2019ve had yet!) arrived with Ted Harty (USA), myself (Erin Magee-USA) and Hawkeye Parker (USA) on May 28 and couldn\u2019t wait to get out and get out on the scooters! We headed out for a day with Duncan at Stingray Charters and got our diving reflexes kicked in at full force with the DiveXtra Cudas. The reefs here in Cayman are incredible- we hit some great swim-throughs and even though our footage didn\u2019t come out it was a memorable experience., 67445=Ashley: Today was my first attempt at a personal best since training began. I spent last night practicing my equalizations in the pool with Rosibel for today\u2019s performance. Feeling pretty confident after all of the practice I suited up this morning adn entered the water with Ted\u2019s last words to me, \u201cIt\u2019s only three more seconds and one more equalization,\u201d in reference to my new depth attempt compared to my old personal best. Warm-ups went well as I decided again to concentrate on FRC\u2019s to get my equalization down. 5-4-3-2-1, peak inhalation, 10 packs and down I go! 1:45 later I surfaced with the tag and a new personal best depth of 58m! See you tomorrow, 61m!, 69660=So I\u2019ve finally got some more photos for you! Kirk was running the camera in the water today and got some great pictures of everyone. Depths went great again today and most people on the boat hit Personal Bests! Garo\u2019s having a bit of ear trouble and will be out of the water tomorrow, but should be back soon to help safety during the competition. Hawkeye\u2019s chest squeeze seems to be all better and he looks like he\u2019ll be going after another Personal Best tomorrow- not too shabby after pulling a clean 7:08 static a couple of days ago! And Rosibel rocked her static the other day too- 5:50! We\u2019re going to have some impressive performances I think during the competition.}",
