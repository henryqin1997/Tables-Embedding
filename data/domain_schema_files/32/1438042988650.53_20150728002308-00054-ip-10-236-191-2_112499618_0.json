Then came \u2018Tropic Thunder\u2019 and the cameo role of a lifetime., 25641=2015 NFL Preview, 27336=In 2011, 12-year-old Garrett Phillips was killed in his upstate New York home. Years passed with no arrest, and now Nick Hillary, a former college soccer coach and an ex-boyfriend of Phillips\u2019s mother, awaits trial on a murder charge.

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{11957=That\u2019s right; this year, Lynch suddenly developed into a great goal-line back, doubling his career high. After requiring an average of 37 carries to score a touchdown before 2011, Lynch was showered with Skittles once every 23 carries during the past season. What are his chances of doing that again? Well, since the merger in 1970, there have been 82 backs who fit Lynch\u2019s 2011 scoring profile, scoring rushing touchdowns at a rate between 21 to 25 carries per score over a 200-carry season. In the season afterward, 47 of those guys got 200 carries again. They scored touchdowns at a rate of one per 35.6 carries, or exactly where Lynch was before last season., 5602=Terrell Davis stands out as the obvious comp for Foster \u2014 unheralded back out of the SEC steps into the starting lineup and puts up numbers like he\u2019s the best running back in football \u2014 but he\u2019s also the cautionary tale. Just like Foster, Broncos fans would have rightly made the case that Davis deserved his big money after years of production. After the 1998 season, when Davis went over 2,000 yards and scored 21 touchdowns, the Broncos locked him up with a seven-year contract extension worth $56 million. Davis lasted four games before tearing his ACL and would average just 3.8 yards on his 312 carries before injuries forced his retirement. The Broncos paid Davis as a reward for his past performance and got very little future performance afterward. We\u2019re not suggesting that Foster is about to tear his ACL, but it\u2019s important to note that the Broncos got roughly similar production from Mike Anderson and then Clinton Portis for not much more than the league minimum., 17506=These signings are another reminder of just how spectacularly risk-averse NFL teams are. Teams are shelling out significant money to exactly the sorts of players who are easiest to replace, just because they\u2019re worried about the unknown. There\u2019s no guarantees that any of these deals will work out and significant evidence that they\u2019re likely to fail. The Steelers and Bengals paid for peace of mind when they franchised Jeff Reed and Shayne Graham in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and got awful results; Reed was released halfway through the year, and Graham missed two crucial field goals in the playoffs against the Jets. The Broncos rewarded a deserving Terrell Davis in 1999, but the money went for naught and his performance was quickly replaced. Good franchises go to the well for undrafted free agents and cheap rookies and realize that there\u2019s talent to be had at certain positions in the well. Naive franchises go to the well, find talent, and spend lots of money to ensure that they\u2019ll never have go to the well again. All they\u2019ve ensured is that they\u2019ll go back to the well with lighter pockets., 13085=Meanwhile, kickers everywhere are being barred from free agency by their organizations, with no fewer than five teams essentially ensuring that they\u2019ll keep their kickers in 2012 by sticking the franchise tag on them. The fact that they\u2019re insistent upon paying a premium for the guys they had last season shows a depressing level of knowledge about the game among decision-makers in front offices., 8734=Seattle beat Houston to the punch by signing Marshawn Lynch to a four-year deal worth $31 million that guarantees him $17 million. As you may remember, the Seahawks acquired Lynch in 2010 for a pair of mid-round picks because the Bills had grown tired of the former first-rounder\u2019s poor attitude and middling play before selecting Clemson back C.J. Spiller with the ninth pick of the first round in that year\u2019s draft. As an addendum to our previous section, note that both Lynch and Spiller have been outplayed during their respective careers by undrafted free agent Fred Jackson, whom the Bills signed out of a career in indoor football and NFL Europe., 7608=In addition, the Texans had little reason to extend Foster on Monday. As a restricted free agent, Foster still had one year left on his contract; Houston could have tendered him a one-year deal at $2.7 million and then matched any contract offer from an opposing team while acquiring the other team\u2019s first-round pick if they declined. (They also could have given him the \u201cexclusive\u201d franchise tag and prevented him from negotiating with other teams altogether.) And by locking Foster up to a long-term deal, the Texans basically punch Mario Williams\u2019s ticket out of town, as it\u2019s hard to see how they\u2019ll be able to afford the unrestricted free agent. Texans fans will now have to hope that the combination of Connor Barwin and Brooks Reed can stay healthy and deliver on the promise they showed in 2011. Ironically, Williams made his way to Houston in 2006 as the first overall pick in that year\u2019s draft because the organization didn\u2019t want to commit serious resources to a running back, Reggie Bush. In 2012, Williams is probably going to be leaving Houston because the organization finally decided to do so., 13499=The reality is that kickers just aren\u2019t consistent from year to year. If kicking were a consistent skill, guys who are scary accurate in one season would also be at the top of the leaderboards the following season. Research has shown that not to be the case. Here\u2019s a simple chart we put together, consisting of every kicker since 1999 who attempted 20 field goals or more in each of two consecutive seasons. You\u2019re about to realize just how maddeningly inconsistent placekickers are., 9403=Lynch isn\u2019t much different from the middling player who thoroughly underwhelmed fans of the AFC East in 2007 and 2008. There are three big differences between the guy who lost his job in Buffalo and the one who just got an extension in Seattle. One is that Lynch\u2019s steady string of legal problems haven\u2019t made their way to Seattle, which is a good sign that he\u2019s matured. Two is that he busted out one of the greatest runs in NFL history during the playoff win over the Saints, who were apparently receiving bounties for falling on their asses and lollygagging down the field during that game. That run\u2019s still awesome, but you don\u2019t pay a guy $17 million for one run from the past. And the third reason? Well, look at the table below and see if you can identify the difference:, 6687=What the Texans needed to do was recognize their strengths and weaknesses as an organization and act accordingly. They have a blocking scheme with a long history of producing successful one-cut running backs on the cheap, and in 2009 second-rounder Ben Tate, they have a replacement for Foster on the ready. And if Tate struggles, they should be able to find the next Foster or Mike Anderson or Reuben Droughns available for the league minimum and plug him in. After they spent all that money on Davis and got very little in return, the Broncos realized how to exploit their competitive advantage and traded away Portis after two fantastic seasons. In return, they got Hall of Fame cornerback Champ Bailey and a second-round pick, which was put to use on running back Tatum Bell, who ran for 2,342 yards and averaged 4.9 yards per carry over the next three seasons. Portis only averaged 4.1 yards per pop., 16511=Even scarier is that two teams franchised kickers who didn\u2019t even have good seasons. Broncos kicker Matt Prater led the league in touchback percentage, but he also spends half his season in the thin air of Denver. He produced a touchback on 30 of his 33 kicks at home during the regular season, but on the road, he only forced a touchback on 18 of his 36 attempts. That 50 percent rate would be good for just 14th in the league. And as a kicker, while he had a pair of game-winners as part of Tebow miracle games, his 19-for-25 season rated out as 28th in the league. (And no, it wasn\u2019t because the thin air forced him into impossible kicks; Prater was 3-for-4 from 50-plus, but just 3-of-7 from the 40-49 range.) And Browns kicker Phil Dawson was franchised despite ranking 19th in field goal accuracy and dead last in touchback percentage. Because he was franchised last year, Dawson will receive a whopping $3.8 million in 2012 after serving as a below-average kicker in 2011., 47974=\u00a9 2015 ESPN Internet Ventures. All rights reserved. Interest-Based Ads, 12635=Perhaps Lynch has really matured and improved since arriving in Seattle, even if that improvement didn\u2019t show up during a dismal regular season in 2010. The Seahawks could have found that out by slapping the franchise tag on him and making him prove it to them for another year before giving Skittles a long-term deal in 2012. Instead, the Seahawks have locked up a player who seems unlikely to reach the same heights of one year ago.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "The problem with paying Foster, though, is that there\u2019s a salary cap. In a league where you can\u2019t just spend as much as you want on whomever you want, owners and team administrators have finite resources to apply to their 53-man roster. And while Foster\u2019s been great the past two years, that production has come in a system that\u2019s basically served as an assembly line for turning unheralded running backs into valuable properties: The Alex Gibbs zone-blocking scheme, which has done wonders in both Denver and Houston. Let\u2019s start with the most notable deal, the five-year, $43.5 million deal given to Texans running back Arian Foster that guarantees the Pro Bowler will receive nearly $21 million. By all accounts, Foster is just about the model football player, with a versatile skill set on the field and a classy, intelligent attitude off it. His production over the past two years ranks with or above any other running back in football, and as we wrote in our agent-style free-agent book on Foster last week, he raised his game when Matt Schaub and Andre Johnson went down with injuries. The Texans really can\u2019t ask for more out of a running back than what they got from Foster these past two seasons. In that sense, he deserved to get paid. History suggests, for a variety of reasons, that they\u2019re wasting their money. After locking out the players",
    "textAfterTable": "Denver\u2019s teams under Mike Shanahan played under Gibbs\u2019s zone-blocking system and famously had a history of producing 1,000-yard backs out of thin air. After Gibbs spent three seasons during the mid-aughts in Atlanta with Warrick Dunn as the inherited featured back, he went to Houston and implemented a system that\u2019s worked wonders with Foster and Steve Slaton. In both stops, the zone-blocking system worked with backs who were rookies with limited pedigrees. Terrell Davis stands out as the obvious comp for Foster \u2014 unheralded back out of the SEC steps into the starting lineup and puts up numbers like he\u2019s the best running back in football \u2014 but he\u2019s also the cautionary tale.
