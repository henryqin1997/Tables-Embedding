Cisco MCS 7845-H2/I2-RC1 and MCS 7835-I2-RC1 servers are supported for upgrades only. However, they are not recommended for use with Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Release 7.0 due to their smaller hard drives. If you are using the DL380-G6 Server from HP, the Application Server software must be at MP_DVD_308-7_0_2_14.iso or higher from manufacturing. IMPORTANT!!! The DL380-G6 Server (AX693A) is shipped with an internal USB Drive, which conflicts with the Linux OS used by the Application Server (MP_DVD_308-7_0_2_14.iso). The problem was fixed in OS 312, but there will be no rebuild of 7.0.2.14. As a workaround, remove the USB Drive from the system.

When installing MP7 or MP8 Application servers, make sure to connect the monitor directly to the server. Using the KVM of any kind (e.g. SIP Based KVM with SMART CABLE) might cause the GUI section of the installation not to be displayed on the monitor and prevent you from continuing the installation.
