It takes a good while to spread and fluff the branches, but if you take the time to do it, the tree looks very real and full. It went together quickly and all of the lights worked. It arrived quickly as promised. This is a great alternative for someone looking to downsize from a large, laborious tree. We love it! -Mary D. 4.5' carolina fir It's a beautiful tree, but would have been nicer if the lights would have been more evenly distributed, rather sparce around the mid section as compared to the lower section. -Sallie J C. Beautiful Carolina Prelit Tree I love this little tree. I was looking for a small tree with lots of lights and this one has 350 on a 4.5 ft.",
