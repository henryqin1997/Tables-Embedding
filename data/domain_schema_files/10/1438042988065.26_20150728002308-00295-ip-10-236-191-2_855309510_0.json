The game is two weeks from today, Friday, May 25 vs the Cubs. Yes, that is a free shirt giveaway night. You can also go to a pre-game reception and recieve an \u201c@Pirates\u201d t-shirt.

    "textBeforeTable": "Looks like I\u2019ll be rooting for Texas and San Diego this postseason. Good luck to my fellow beleaguered fans! There are no real shockers on this list. The Cubs are the most beleaguered and the Yankees are the least, but I think the order has some surprises here and there. What you see below doesn\u2019t take into account number of titles won. It\u2019s just a simple average of the number of years since a franchise has won the World Series, made the postseason, etc. I\u2019ve named that average \u201cBeleagueredness.\u201d A friend (@ryanstats) asked me last night who I cheer for when the Pirates get knocked out of contention each year. At the time I told him that I don\u2019t cheer for anyone else, but today I was toying around one of my spreadsheets and realized that I do cheer for another team. I cheer for whichever contending team has gone the longest without winning. Maybe it\u2019s a kindred spirit I feel with that team\u2019s fans, maybe it\u2019s because I like to fill in empty slots on the page.

The offense still hasn\u2019t been great, scoring 22 runs (3.14/game) but the pitching has really stepped up, allowing only 23 runs (3.29/g) with twelve of those coming in Saturday\u2019s loss. Small Sample Size fun: Pedro Alvarez has a seven game hitting streak (.333), has homered in back to back games (2) and has consecutive multi-hit games. Tim at Buccofans.com had a nice article last week about Brad Lincoln in his first four starts at a level compared to the rest of his starts there. Tonight is Brad\u2019s sixth major league start and it comes in his hometown of Houston. Let\u2019s hope they can keep it up versus the hapless Astros!
