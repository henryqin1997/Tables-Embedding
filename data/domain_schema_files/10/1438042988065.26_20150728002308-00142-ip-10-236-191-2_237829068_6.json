San Diego took Mike Ivie as the draft's number one selection, Montreal tabbed Barry Foote with the 3rd pick and Milwaukee chose Darrell Porter with the draft's 4th selection. The Chicago White Sox may have had the most productive June draft selecting pitchers Terry Forster (2nd round) and Rich Gossage (9th round) in the regular phase and infielder Bucky Dent (1st round) in the secondary phase. The regular and secondary phases of the January draft proved more fruitful to major league clubs than the June draft. Those selected in the regular phase in January included Chris Chambliss (Cleveland, 1st round), Greg Minton (Kansas City, 3rd round) and Joel Youngblood (Cincinnati, 2nd round). In the secondary phase, Doug DeCinces was selected by Baltimore in the 3rd round, Rick Burleson by Boston in the 1st round, Bill Madlock by Washington in the 5th round and Chris Speier by San Francisco in the 1st round. 1970 1965-69 \u00a0|\u00a0 1970-79 \u00a0|\u00a0 1980-89 \u00a0|\u00a0 1990-99 \u00a0|\u00a0 2000-09 \u00a0|\u00a0 2010s Draft Report: 1970s Draft History home \u00bb First-Year Player Draft History History All-Time Picks Video Order Top 200",

In the secondary phase, Burt Hooton (Chicago Cubs, 1st round), Steve Rogers (Montreal, 1st round) and Steve Busby (Kansas City, 2nd round) were chosen. Pitcher Mike Flanagan was selected in the 15th round of the June regular phase by Houston, but enrolled at the University of Massachusetts. One of the more interesting highlights of the June draft was that five quarterbacks were selected including future NFL stars Archie Manning, Steve Bartkowski and Joe Theismann. Danny Goodwin, the nation's top pick, couldn't agree to terms with the White Sox and became the first top choice who did not sign a contract.
