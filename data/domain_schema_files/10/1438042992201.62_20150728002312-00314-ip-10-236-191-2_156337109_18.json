For divisional rivals, it also establishes set weeks each season that you will face a certain team, which I think gives the schedule a bit more traditionalist feel if, e.g., Michigan and Michigan State always meet the first weekend of November, or the Little Brown Jug game is always played the week before Thanksgiving., 101291=JACK: I visited up there today (yesterday, June 14th), and they offered me.

These tiers will serve as a value for calculating the expected difficulty of playing any of these teams over a 10-year span. They were assigned tier levels by recent and historical success, and duh -- if you want to dispute duh you are welcome to do so. The tiers as follows: I broke my conferences up exactly how Delany described, starting by listing competitive balance on a tier level, then protecting rivalries, then geography. Before shouting, wait to see the protected rivalries in the ninth game. How It Was Made The Pac11Ten currently plays nine conference games. They are a separate case entirely, but it's well to point out that, despite what it may say in the record books, USC went to a lot of BCS championship games playing nine conference opponents. The extra losses probably cost them some bowl eligibility at the bottom, which fans won't mourn an erstwhile 6-6 team that finishes 5-7 but the conference certainly will. The downside is it necessarily decreases the number of wins in the conference overall -- 12 games",
