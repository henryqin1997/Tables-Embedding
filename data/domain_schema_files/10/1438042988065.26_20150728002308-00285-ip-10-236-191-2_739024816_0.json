    "textBeforeTable": "Chemical compositions of some wrought copper-nickel alloys and Nickel Silvers Copper-Nickel alloys (Nickel Silvers) are used in decorative applications and for manufacturing resistance wire, optical parts, screws, rivets, clips, tableware, electrical contacts. Copper-Nickel alloys are used for manufacturing coins, sea water equipment, evaporators, heat exchanger tubes, automotive hydraulic and cooling systems. Separate group of copper-nickel alloys is Spinodal Bronzes: copper-nickel-tin alloys possessing high mechanical strength due to a controlled heat treatment called Spinodal decomposition. The alloys are strengthened by cold work (strain hardening). Ductility of the alloys decreases as a result of cold work. Iron, manganese and chromium are added to the wrought Copper-Nickel alloys for increasing their hardness and strength. Wrought Copper-Nickel alloys have moderate mechanical strength and high ductility combined with very good corrosion resistance (particularly in sea water). Copper-Nickel alloys and most of Copper-Nickel-Zinc alloys have mono-phase structure (\u03b1-phase) and possess very good formability in cold and hot states. Wrought Copper-Nickel-Zinc alloys may contain up to 6% of manganese (Mn) as additional alloying element. Copper-Nickel-Zinc Alloys (Nickel Silvers) are copper alloys containing 8-25% of nickel (Ni) and 17-45% of zinc (Zn) as the major alloying elements. Wrought Copper-Nickel-Zinc alloys are designated with the numbers from C73500 through C79999.",
