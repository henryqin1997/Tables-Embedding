Get off at Eschborn S\u00fcd. From the station it's a 10 minute walk to the office. If you can (Klaas for sure), buy tickets with a destination of \"Eschborn S\u00fcd\". In that case, you don't have to buy another ticket when you arrive in Frankfurt. If you can only get tickets to Frankfurt central station, you will have to buy a ticket for the metro destination code 50.  Directions from the airport: buy a one way ticket to destination code 50. Take S8 or S9 in direction to Frankfurt or Hanau. Get off at Frankfurt central station. Switch to S3 or S4 on the other platform and go in direction Bad Soden or Kronberg. Get off at Eschborn S\u00fcd. From the station it's a 10 minute walk to the office.  Frankfurt am Main has the largest german airport and also is the main international hub in germany. The SyroCon office is located in Eschborn which is either a 20 min cab ride from the airport or you can take public transport.  [edit] Travelling",
