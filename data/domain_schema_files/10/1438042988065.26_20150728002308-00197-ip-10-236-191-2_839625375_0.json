The first pitch I prepared as Head Groundsman and to see the players out on it was special and a real highlight. It was England against Pakistan and there were some great players. Michael Atherton was Captain and Pakistan had Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis\u2026 Ijaz Ahmed got 141 before Cork bowled him, caught by Russell. I remember it well!, 31440=Well my golden rule really is don\u2019t ever forget your end of season renovations. I think there\u2019s a tendency for the lower leagues to say, that\u2019s it, the season\u2019s over, leave it now until March and go off and do their own things now that the season\u2019s done with and all the renovations to the pitch and outfield is left to one person. But that\u2019s really the worst thing you can do, the end of season renovations have to be carried out properly and not be rushed, it\u2019ll be much easier and you\u2019ll prepare much better pitches for the start of the season if you look after your pitch and give it some TLC at the end of the season., 10444=Monday 3 August 2015 - Royal London One Day Cup Buy Tickets, 11975=Friday 11 September 2015 - Hospitality Buy Tickets, 3345=Thursday 30 July 2015, 11158=Tuesday 18 August 2015 - Royal London One Day Cup Buy Tickets, 25784=The gap between the off season and season is getting shorter and shorter as the seasons continue to grow, often teams are wanting outdoor nets as early as mid-march so they have to be ready and considering the season doesn\u2019t end until the end of September that only gives the field a five month recovery period and preparation period. So actually, winter isn\u2019t as quiet as it used to be, now it\u2019s every bit as important as summer.}",
