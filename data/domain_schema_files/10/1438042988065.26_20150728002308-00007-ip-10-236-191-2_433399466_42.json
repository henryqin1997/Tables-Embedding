And the loss of Alexis Prince and Kayla Brewer in 2009 further dissipated the team. One can argue that these critical personnel losses are due to recruiting oversights by the coaches., 53838=(03/02/10)\u00a0\u00a0 The Lake Mary Rams redeemed themselves for the past two missed opportunities at the FHSAA 6A title this past Saturday with a 49-40 win over Miami Lourdes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Rams fell two points short in 2009.\u00a0\u00a0 And I don't even wanna talk about 2008, when they clearly had the best 6A team in Florida and lost in the regional semis., 34132=I distinctly remember one game at YBOA 11U Nationals in 2002.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Miracle had blown a 5 point lead against their hated rivals, the Palm Beach Waverunners and trailed 29-28.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Miracle had the ball out of bounds at the far end of the court, on the sidelines.\u00a0\u00a0 There were 4 seconds to play.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Remember, these were 11 year old girls.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Waverunners were implementing a withering backcourt press., 85908=\u00a0\u00a02008, 33508=I've covered a team that couldn't win close games before.\u00a0\u00a0 The 2001-2005 Orlando Miracle had a 93% losing record in games that were decided by 10 points or less.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I found this troubling, since the Miracle's overall winning percentage was 95%.\u00a0\u00a0 Most of their wins were blowouts.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The 5% of games they lost were usually close games against tough teams.\u00a0\u00a0 The effect of such losses to comparable teams was acutely painful, I remember, and usually due to easily rectifiable coaching decisions., 48184=Since the summer of 2008, this once dominant franchise has abandoned its historical player development techniques and has adopted the recruit-the-latest-and-the-greatest strategy of other teams., 81744=\u00a02008, 48610=The Comets started out as a 10U team known as the Cool Waves. They had Brooke Thomas, Briyanna Blair, Jacky Nikic, Denisse Marquez and several other notable local players. They dominated the state up until 2003, when they were forced to reckon with the upstart Orlando Lightning and the Clearwater Heatwave, who'd merged in an effort to take down the queens. Political infighting on that Lightning/Heatwave team undermined their efforts however, and their coach called Comets Coach Jack Givens about yet another merger. From this merger the Comets picked up Krystal Thomas, Asia Wilson and Sthefany Thomas. These players made the regionally dominant Comets into a national power. By 2006, the Comets were National Champions., 37200=Long story short, in a span of 2:15, the Red team's hard earned lead went from 15 points to 3 points.\u00a0\u00a0 Ultimately, the Red team won by 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But easing up off the throttle turned a comfortable win into a nailbiter.\u00a0\u00a0 All of the Blue team's points came at the foul line., 30348=Good, solid team.\u00a0\u00a0 Tough.\u00a0\u00a0 Scrappy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Has all the tools in place to be a contender this year, a presence next year, and a national calibre team in the summer of 2012 if the core players stay together., 49423=I would argue that the Comets were even better in 2007. They added Kelsey Assarian, Jennifer George, Ashley Jones, Andrell Smith, Andrea Smith, Cassie Peoples, Chandler McCabe and Erin Knight to a roster that returned Alexa Deluzio, Brooke Thomas, Sasha Chaplin and Jordan Coleman. Every single one of these players signed with major D1 schools, something that's never been accomplished by any team in Florida. If not for Jenn George's season ending injury, I think this team could and should have won both AAU Nationals and Nike Nationals., 54703=But the 2010 Rams, led by second year coach Rick Weyers, expunged those demons and brought the championship home to its rightful owners.\u00a0\u00a0 The Rams completed a scintillating 32-1 season and earned its third state championship since 1998., 58125=In the championship game, Jones picked up where she left off.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Morgan drained her first triple on the Rams first possession, thus setting the tone for the game.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"I GOTS ta have it today, ladies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You'll excuse my ambivalence towards your youthful ambitions.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And she proceeded to pile up numbers reminiscent of Brittany Waters' 32 point outburst against Norland in the 2007 6A championship game.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jones knocked down shots from every point on the court.\u00a0\u00a0 Here she was knocking down a shot from the elbow.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Here she was driving the baseline.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now she's pump faking and going to the hole., 31297=The Thunder decided to bring their team over to the Comets organization in 2010.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the tryouts in February, only two Comets Red players from 2009 remained with the team--Laniere Coleman and Corrie Duren.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A few players left altogether.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The remainder decided to play with older Comets teams., 88024=\u00a02007}",
