Tendulkar was on his way to his highest Test score i.e. 248 not out. In doing so, he equaled Sunil Gavaskar\u2019s mark of 34 Test tons. Zaheer came in and smashed 75, which remained the highest score for a No 11 in Test cricket for many years. Ghulam Ahmed and Hemu Adhikari\u2019s stand of 109 of 1952 was broken by Shami and Bhuvneshwar. That stand came in Pakistan\u2019s maiden Test and helped India setup a tough total.

This is now the second highest tenth wicket stand for India in Tests and in the third consecutive home season, England have conceded a century stand for the last wicket.

All Rights Reserved., 74470=Sun, Jul 26, 2015 \u00a0at Hambantota, 33203=In three consecutive home seasons, England have conceded one hundred-run partnership for the tenth wicket in Tests. In the latest instance, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammed Shami batted with good application and then attacked England to extend India\u2019s score. This partnership helped tip the balance in India\u2019s favour on Day Two at a time when they had collapsed and were in danger of giving away the advantage. The last wicket stand would continue to haunt England for some time and they would hope they break the streak next here., 40329=2010, 77322=Live Cricket Scorecard: England vs Australia, The Ashes 2015 3rd Test at Edgbaston, Day 2, 43677=1985, 74029=T20 WC Qualifier, 2015, Final, 39937=S Sreesanth-Harbhajan Singh, 44268=Zaheer had smashed 75 against Bangladesh in 2004.

If you look at it in context of the game, it was crucial as England won the game by a whisker on a thrilling last day. Such partnerships not only frustrate an opposing captain but can also change the complexion of a game. Shami and Bhuvneshwar helped take India above not one but two psychological barriers \u2014 400 and 450.
