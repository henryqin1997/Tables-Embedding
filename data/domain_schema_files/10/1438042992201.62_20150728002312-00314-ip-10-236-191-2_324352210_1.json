All other marks are the property of their respective owners., 64366=The iShares\u00ae iBonds\u00ae ETFs (\"Funds\") will terminate on or about March 31 of the year in each Fund\u2019s name. An investment in the Fund(s) is not guaranteed, and an investor may experience losses, including near or at the termination date. Unlike a direct investment in a bond that has a level coupon payment and a fixed payment at maturity, the Fund(s) will make distributions of income that vary over time. In the final months of each Fund\u2019s operation, as the bonds it holds mature, its portfolio will transition to cash and cash-like instruments. As a result, its yield will tend to move toward prevailing money market rates, and may be lower than the yields of the bonds previously held by the Fund and lower than prevailing yields in the bond market. Following the Fund\u2019s termination date, the Fund will distribute substantially all of its net assets, after deduction of any liabilities, to then-current investors without further notice and will no longer be listed or traded. The Funds\u2019 distributions and liquidation proceeds are not predictable at the time of investment and the Funds do not seek to return any predetermined amount. The rate of Fund distribution payments may adversely affect the tax characterization of an investor\u2019s returns from an investment in the Fund relative to a direct investment in bonds. If the amount an investor receives as liquidation proceeds upon the Fund\u2019s termination is higher or lower than the investor\u2019s cost basis, the investor may experience a gain or loss for tax purposes., 45296=as of 30-Jun-2015, 66203=Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times., 3725=as of 03-Aug-2015}",
