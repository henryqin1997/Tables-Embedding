Maybe you'll be the one lady who actually reads this. I'm unemployed & need a ride home from jail. Can I borrow your car? I'm totally irresponsible, sloppy, lazy & insecure, I love to play immature head games- lie, cheat & spend your money on beer. I never come home on time, I have a lot of loser friends. I once held a job for 6 days, but some dude tried to tell me what to do. I know how to make a hamburger. I've been staying with my mommy for about 47 years. I recently stole her car & credit cards but she dropped the charges. So I'm free! I'm ready to get into a relationship that will completely leave",
