    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{17616=While there are still some arguments, particularly from conservative commentators, our experiences suggest that triplets reduced to twins do much better in terms of loss and prematurity than do unreduced triplets. We believe that if a patient\u2019s primary goal is to maximize the chances of surviving children, that reduction of triplets to twins or a singleton achieves the best live born results. The trade off is between morbidity and mortality. More recent analyses suggest that while mortality is lowest with twins, morbidity is lowest with remaining singletons. Recent data have also suggested that adverse perinatal outcomes are more common in IVF patients even in singletons.36, 37 Numerous papers argued over the past several years whether triplets have better outcomes \u201creduced\u201d or not. Yaron et al.38 compared triplets to twins data to unreduced triplets with two large cohorts of twins. The data show substantial improvement of reduced twins as compared to triplets. The data from the most recent collaborative series suggest that pregnancy outcomes for cases starting at triplets or even quadruplets reduced to twins do fundamentally as well as starting as twins. Antsaklis et al. showed a reduction of losses from 15.41% to 4.76% for twins and diminishment of low birth weight from 28% to 11%.39 These data therefore support some cautious aggressiveness in infertility treatments to achieve pregnancy in difficult clinical situations. However, when higher numbers occur, good outcomes clearly diminish. Luke et al. have suggested that in twin pregnancies with assisted reproduction fetal reduction increased the risks for birth at <30 weeks, very low birth weight, and slowed midgestational growth.40 This analysis, however, ignores that starting conditions, i.e., as compared to keeping the quadruplets, how did they do? Kozinsky et al. showed that the perinatal outcomes of singleton and twin pregnancies following ARTs were comparable to spontaneously conceived, matched pregnancies.41 McDonald et al. have recently shown in a meta-analysis that twins from IVF even when matched to spontaneously conceived twins had somewhat higher risks for preterm birth but no significant differences in perinatal deatlhs, congenital malformations or low birth weight.42 A 2001 paper suggested that reduced triplets did worse than continuing ones.43 However, analysis of that series showed a loss rate following MFPR twice that seen in our collaborative series15 and poorer outcomes in every other category for the remaining triplets. Several other recent papers have likewise shown higher risks for \u201cunreduced\u201d triplets than for reduced cases.44, 45, 46, 47 It is clear that one must use extreme caution in choosing comparison groups. Blickstein has reported that triplets do worse than reduced twins in every perinatal category in his large database.48, 12896=In the 2001 collaborative report the subset of patients who reduced from two to one (not for fetal anomalies) included 154 patients. These data suggested a loss rate comparable to three to two, but, in about one third of the two to one cases, there was a medical indication for the procedure, e.g., maternal cardiac disease or prior twin pregnancy with severe prematurity, or uterine abnormality.15 In recent years, however, the demographics have been changing and the vast majority of such cases are from women in their 40s, or even 50s, some of whom are using donor eggs and who, more for social than medical reasons, only want a singleton pregnancy.21, 43, 44, 45 New data suggest that twins reduced to a singleton do better than remaining as twins.17, 34 Consistent with the above, more women are desiring to reduce to a singleton. In a recent series of triplets, we found the average age of outpatients reducing to twins to be 37 years and to a singleton 41 years.17 While the reduction in pregnancy loss risk for three to one is not as much as three to two (15% to 7% and 15% to 5%, respectively), the gestational age at delivery for the resulting singleton is higher, and the incidence of birth weights <1500 g is 10 higher for twins than singletons.1 These data have made counseling of such patients far more complex than in the past (Figure 4). Not surprisingly there are often differences between members of the couple as to the desirability of twins or a singleton.54 There are also profound public health implications regarding these decisions, as 2000 United States data showed that of $10.2 billion spent per year on initial newborn care, 57% of the money was spent on the 9% of babies born at <37 weeks.55, 56, 57 In 2003, more than $10 billion was spent on the 12.3% born preterm.56 The Institute of Medicine in 2006 reported that preterm births cost the United States approximately $26 billion per year.57 Data are now also emerging that there is considerably higher neurologic and developmental disability in 6 year olds who survived birth at 26 weeks or less. The rates of severe, moderate, and mild disabilty were 22%, 24%, and 34%, respectively. Significant cerebral palsy was present in 12%.58 Hack et al. also have now shown that in babies born at less than 1000 g, the rate of cerebral palsy was 14% as opposed to 0% for controls. Asthma, poor vision, IQ <85, and poor motor skills were all also substantially higher.59, 26246=For patients who are \u201colder\u201d particularly using their own eggs, genetic counseling and diagnosis has become an integral part of our process. By 2003, more than 50% of patients in the United States having ART cycles were over 35, and the proportion continues to rise (Table 4).1, 11, 12, 14 In the 1980s and early 1990s, the most common approach was to offer amniocentesis at 16\u201317 weeks on the remaining twins. However, a 1995 paper suggested an 11% loss rate in these cases, which caused considerable concern.19 Fortunately, the issue was settled by a much larger collaborative series in 1998 that showed that loss rates were no higher than comparable controls of MFPR patients who did not have amniocentesis.20 The collaborative data show a loss rate of 5%, which was certainly no higher than in the group of patients postMFPR who did not have genetic studies., 31008=Data taken from National Vital Statistics Report, Volume 56: 242, 2007., 36863=Table 1. Twins and triplets from assisted reproductive technologies: 2005 SART data, 44799=ISSN: 1756-2228, 28941=Despite the increased reliance of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) in infertility treatments, the proportion of cases significantly hyperstimulated and resulting in quintuplets or more has dramatically decreased to less than 5% of all cases seen by us.13 Regardless, the 2004 report of the Society of Assisted Reproductive Technologies (SART) suggested that, of all pregnancies achieved by ART, in the United States 60.3% are singletons, 28.6% twins, 4.9% triplets or higher, and 6.2% were unknown.14 CDC data from 2005 show that the proportion of multiples that are twins, as opposed to higher numbers has increased slightly reflecting more of an increase in the number of twins rather than a fall in triplets and higher order multiples with 2003\u20132005 showing a decrease but being too short a time frame to be certain of a real trend.1, 20411=Several centers with the world\u2019s largest experience have collaborated to increase the power of their data. In 1993 the first collaborative report showed a 16% pregnancy loss rate through 24 completed weeks.33 Such numbers actually represented a major improvement for higher order multiple pregnancies. Further collaborative papers have shown continued dramatic improvements in the overall outcomes of such pregnancies (Table 2).13, 15 The 2001 collaborative data demonstrated that the outcome of triplets reduced to twins, and quadruplets reduced to twins now perform essentially as if they started as twins.15 Even with the tremendous advances in neonatal care for premature babies, the 95% take home baby rate for those who start with triplets and the 92% take home baby rate for those who start with quadruplets clearly represent dramatic improvements over natural statistics. Not only has the pregnancy loss rate been substantially lowered, but so has the rate of very dangerous early prematurity. Both continue to be correlated with the starting number. Data from the past few years show that the improvements are, not surprisingly, greatest from the higher starting numbers (Figure 3).13, 34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 35007=Fig. 1. Prematurity risks as a function of fetal number. Diagonally hatched bars, preterm birth <32 weeks; shaded bars, birth weight <1500 g. (2002 United States Centers for Disease Control data.), 14235=An ever increasing situation involves the inclusion of a monozygotic (MZ) pair of twins in a higher order multiple.49 Our experience suggests that provided the \u201csingleton\u201d seems healthy, that the best outcomes are achieved by reduction of the MZ twins. Obviously, if the singleton is not healthy, then keeping the twins is the next choice. Pregnancy loss is not the only deleterious outcome. Very early preterm delivery correlates with the starting number. However, it has not been well appreciated that about 20% of babies born at less than 750 g develop cerebral palsy.50 In Western Australia, Petterson et al. showed that the rate of cerebral palsy was 4.6 times higher for twins than singletons per live birth, but 8.3 times higher when calculated per pregnancy.51 Pharoah and Cooke calculated cerebal palsy rates per 1000 first year survivors at 2.3 for singletons, 12.6 for twins, and 44.8 for triplets.52 In a small series in a report of a questionnaire Dimitiriou et al. showed no differences between triplets and twins, but there was insufficient power to reach such conclusions.53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}",

Twins and triplets from assisted reproductive technologies: 2005 SART data Incredibly, it is now more than three decades since Louise Brown\u2019s birth, the first IVF baby. Millions of babies have been born benefiting from infertility therapies including more than 2,000,000 IVF babies. These incredible success stories, however, have had corresponding serious side effects. The twin pregnancy rate, commonly quoted for decades to be 1 in 90, has more than doubled in the United States to more than 1 in 30,1 and approximately 65% of all twins in the United States are secondary to infertility treatments. Some IVF programs create as many multiples as singletons. In fact nearly one half of all IVF babies are part of multiples suggesting that nearly a third of all pregnancies are multiples (Table 1).2 Furthermore, monozygotic twinning, per se, and as part of higher order multiples has continued to rise with its associated dramatically increased risks of anomalies, loss, and prematurity.3, 4 Multiple pregnancy rates have continued to rise, and the incidence of prematurity and related sequelae closely correlate with fetal number (Figure 1) (Tables 2 and 3).1\u00a0 With increasing public, professional, and legal attention, some of the very high order multiples have diminished, particularly secondary to lower transfer numbers of embryos in IVF.5, 6, 7, 8 There are some suggestions that the incidence of quadruplets and higher multiples is slowly diminishing, but the incidence is still very high.9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
