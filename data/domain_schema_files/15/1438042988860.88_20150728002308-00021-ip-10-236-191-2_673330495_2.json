I would take Rodgers in a heartbeat, and let's not pretend that the Vikings wouldn't still be at least 9-4 with Tarvaris Jackson. Also the 2008 Packers were snakebit something terrible and the defense blew a ton of games late; they were much, much better than their 6-10 record., 45576=The era in which they play(namely post 2004) simply makes the idea that Rodgers, in his second season, is beating out any season Favre put up worth beating out simply on his own talent. 2004 rules, Jennings+Driver, and he still only has 15 wins when Favre. A good heir, perhaps one day better, but Favre is probably the reason Green Bay isn't Detroit, and that's why he'll always deserve top billing in my book., 21015=This entry was posted on Wednesday, December 16th, 2009 at 2:55 pm and is filed under General.

Both comments and pings are currently closed., 28418=5 worst pass defenses (by passer rating) since 1995: 1. 2008 Lions - 110.9 2. 2009 Lions - 108.8 3. 2005 Titans - 100.7 4. 1996 Falcons - 100.6 5. 2005 Texans - 100.0, 62089=Peyton Manning has an adjusted yards per pass of 6.88 in the playoffs, compared to 6.61 for Tom Brady. He didn't do much with that dominant offense in 2007, so I don't want to hear it really., 24722=And all of that is ignoring that Favre now plays in a dome AND has had a very easy schedule. I've got no doubt that when we adjust Favre's numbers after this season for era, weather and SOS, 2009 will look much more like an average Favre season than anything else. It will almost certainly rank outside of the top five., 47617=I don't know if Brett Favre would have made much of a difference for the 2008 Green Bay Packers. Just ask the 2008 New York Jets., 47426=Re: Bob #12, one guy is locked up thru 2014. The other guy is a coin flip every year if he is returning. I'd much rather have a franchise build a team around the former.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Brett Favre is having an MVP-caliber campaign for the Vikings this season, which approximately no one saw coming after last year's late-season meltdown with the Jets. But you may be surprised to see that, at least in terms of his rate stats, Favre is actually having arguably the best season of his entire career this year, at the ripe old age of 40!
