Note: An abrupt increase in water depth will cause lab-lab to detach and float. Install fine-meshed screens (bastidor or lumpot) at the gates to prevent the re-entry of wild species or the possible escape of stock. Monitor water quality parameters (turbidity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, temperature regularly to check for any sign of risk. Maintain the optimum water condition to support maximum growth of milkfish. Change water at least every two weeks or as frequent as possible. Install a stand-by water pump to maintain desired water depth when water management through tidal fluctuation is not possible. Pond water management Purchase the required fry once every year of operation, especially during the peak season in May. Start production in the nursery pond, then the transition pond, formation pond, and finally the rearing pond. Divide the grow-out process into two phases: formation and rearing phases. Allow the fingerlings to from a 20 g fingerling size to a 50 g post-fingerling size in the formation pond using natural food organisms as primary food for the stock. Transfer the post-fingerlings to the rearing pond. Milkfish will grow to the marketable size of 250 g in three months at an average growth rate of 2.2 g/day. Expect the milkfish to grow",
