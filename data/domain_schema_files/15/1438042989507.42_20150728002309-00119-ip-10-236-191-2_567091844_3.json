The new lineup consists of two 13-inch models, two 15-inch models (down from three in the previous generation) and one 17-inch model. The 13-inch models come with Intel\u2019s integrated HD Graphics 3000, and either a 2.3GHz dual-core Core i5 processor and a 5400-rpm 320GB hard drive for $1199, or a 2.7GHz dual-core Core i7 processor with a 5400-rpm 500GB hard drive for $1499. Both 15-inch models come with Intel\u2019s integrated HD Graphics 3000. The $1799 configuration sports a 2GHz quad-core Core i7 processor, a 5400-rpm 500GB drive, and a discrete AMD Radeon HD 6490M graphics processor with 256MB of GDDR5 video memory, while the $2199 offering features a 2.2GHz quad-core Core i7 processor, a 5400-rpm 750GB drive, and a discrete AMD Radeon HD 6750M graphics processor with 1GB of GDDR5 video memory. The $2499 17-inch model has the same specs as the $2199 15-inch model. All MacBook Pros have 4GB of 1333MHz DDR3 memory.}",

Speedmark 6.5 scores are relative to those of a 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo Mac mini (Mid 2010) with 2GB of RAM, which is assigned a score of 100. We duplicated a 1GB file, created a Zip archive in the Finder from the two 1GB files and then unzipped it. We converted 135 minutes of AAC audio files to MP3 using iTunes\u2019 High Quality setting. In iMovie \u201909, we imported a camera archive and exported it to iTunes using the Mobile Devices setting. We ran a Timedemo at 1024-by-768 with 4X anti-aliasing on in Call of Duty 4. We imported 200 JPEGs into iPhoto \u201909. The Photoshop Suite test is a set of 23 scripted tasks using a 50MB file. Photoshop\u2019s memory was set to 70 percent and History was set to Minimum. For our multitasking test, we timed the Photoshop test again, but with the iTunes MP3 encoding and file compression tests running in the background. We used Handbrake to encode four chapters from a DVD previously ripped to the hard drive to H.264. We recorded how long it took to render a scene with multiprocessors in Cinebench and ran that application's OpenGL, frames per second test. We ran the Evaluate Notebook test in MathematicaMark 7. We ran the WorldBench 6 multitasking test on a Parallels 6 VM running Windows 7 Professional. We timed the import and processing time for 200 photos in Aperture.\u2014Macworld Lab testing by James Galbraith, William Wang, and Mauricio Grijalva, 4204=The 15-inch 2.0GHz quad core Core i7 MacBook Pro was 33 percent faster overall than the 15-inch 2.4GHz dual core Core i5 system introduced last April. The new MacBook Pro\u2019s Handbrake time was 51 percent faster than the older system, while its iTunes encoding times were 24 percent faster. Duplicating and Unzipping files didn\u2019t see much improvement between the systems, and Call of Duty framerate was slower than the older system.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Speedmark 6.5 results: 2011 MacBook Pros The integrated graphics processor in each MacBook Pro has also changed, with Intel\u2019s HD 3000 graphics installed across the line. In the last generation of MacBook Pros, Apple used Intel\u2019s integrated HD graphics only in the higher-end models that had a second, higher-powered GPU, the Nvidia GeForce GT 330M, for graphically intensive applications. Apple didn\u2019t think the older Intel HD graphics were powerful enough to be the only option in those older 13-inch models, which couldn\u2019t support two graphics chips, so the company stuck with Core 2 Duo processors and used Nvidia\u2019s integrated GeForce 320M graphics. With the new HD Graphics 3000, Apple found the improved performance good enough to finally invite the 13-inch models into the Core i era. What we can test is the effect the new processors and graphics have on performance. Intel Core i series processors (known by the code-name Sandy Bridge), are found inside every new MacBook Pro. With the processor, cache, graphics, and memory controller all residing on the same die, these Core i5 and Core i7 processors helped propel the new MacBook Pros well past their predecessors in CPU performance. The only external clue to any changes comes in the form of a tiny icon near what was the Mini DisplayPort connector. It\u2019s now the Thunderbolt port, a new technology that Intel developed with input from Apple. The port looks like the Mini DisplayPort and you can still connect a LED Cinema",
