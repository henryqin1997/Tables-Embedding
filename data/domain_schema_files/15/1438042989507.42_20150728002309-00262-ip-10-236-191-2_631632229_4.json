The pleasant surprise with GMac was his ability to solidly play the point guard position. Unexpectedly thrust into role as the starting point guard his freshman year as a result of Billy Edelin's suspension, GMac started every game of the season at the point, and was a key factor in the NCAA Championship season. He tied an NCAA record with 6 three point baskets in the first half of the championship game; an injury shortly before half time shut him down for the second half. A scrappy player, and one of the most popular players in Syracuse history, McNamara was named to the Big East third team his sophomore year, and the Big East first team his junior and senior years. Busloads of fans would drive up to the Carrier Dome to see 'The Mayor of Scranton' play each",
