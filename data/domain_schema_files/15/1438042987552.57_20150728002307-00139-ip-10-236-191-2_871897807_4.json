With the effective use of VMs, I am able to concurrently run 9 VMs on my workstation. There are three pictures at the bottom of this page: Very interesting to see how the Yum Langpack Plugin and the Udisks disk management improvements are proceeding. Good to see how the iBus Intelligent Input Bus \"input framework method system\" and Ext4 file system \"checksum feature for the journal\" have developed. My latest Fedora 12 (Constantine) kernel is 2.6.32.12-115.fc12.i686.PAE.
