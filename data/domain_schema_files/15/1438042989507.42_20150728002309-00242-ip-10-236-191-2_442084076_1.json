Source of quote Feasibility: Do available off-the-shelf products address the need? How much of the existing equipment and infrastructure will need to be replaced or upgraded? Is there an affordable solution? Trade study and cost benefit: Evaluate alternative approaches, such as retaining existing computers, controllers, cabinets, and communications infrastructure versus replacing some or all of these. Consider alternative communications protocols, their impact on initial and future product choices, communications infrastructure requirements, and options. Stakeholder issues: Consider performance measurement, needs of management, monitoring, control features needed by operations personnel, and self-diagnostic features needed by maintenance personnel. Risk management: Ask product vendors for input and cost estimates to ensure proposed solution is feasible and affordable Base analysis on mature, proven products Forego requirements that would require modification to off-the-shelf software or hardware Give preference to flexible, standards-based solutions",

The system automatically synchronizes the clocks in signal controllers and commands controllers to change timing patterns when appropriate. Operators periodically check status, update signal timings, respond to alarms, use collected data in various analyses, add new signals to the system, and use the system to temporarily adjust signal timings during incidents. Measures of effectiveness for validation: Traffic signal equipment failures are reliably detected and appropriate personnel notified in a timely manner Data collected by the system are successfully used for traffic analysis and signal timing refinement Adjusted signal timings are downloaded reliably when needed The system is used to temporarily adjust signal timings during incidents. Controller clocks are kept synchronized System users give favorable reports as to the ease of use and effectiveness of the system The system has a low failure rate and does not require an unreasonable amount of maintenance The number of citizen complaints that could be avoided by an effective system is reduced",

The absence of new software development, use of COTS components, re-use of existing communications infrastructure, and absence of integration with other systems\u2026 all reduce risk and complexity. On the other hand, selection of the optimum system, ensuring the new system operates effectively, achieving a smooth transition from the old system to the new, ensuring operations & maintenance personnel are adequately trained, and having the project completed within budget and schedule will require careful project management [including appropriate systems engineering]. This project involves replacing an obsolete traffic signal management system with a new system. This system uses computers located at City Hall to provide remote monitoring and control of traffic signals. The existing system is no longer supported by the manufacturer. It is unreliable and not maintainable. It lacks the functionality needed and available in more modern systems. A needs & feasibility study identified needs, high-level requirements, investigated the capabilities, and costs of available off-the-shelf traffic signal management systems. It concluded that an off-the-shelf system using existing communications infrastructure will suffice. However, the existing signal controllers [not cabinets], central computers, and software will need to be replaced. The estimated project cost is $1,500,000, exclusive of on-going operation and maintenance costs. There is no immediate need for center-to-center interaction between this system and other systems. The stakeholders desire is to exchange data in the future. [Please",
