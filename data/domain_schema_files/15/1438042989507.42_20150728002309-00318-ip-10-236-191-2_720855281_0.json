This was my second year appearing at the conference, and meeting the student liaisons is one of the highlights., 7546=The following article appeared in Chad Millman\u2019s ESPN Insider blog on August 10th and\u00a0can be found on ESPN.com.}",

The following table summarizes each year\u2019s activity.\u201d For a more specific breakdown of his math, here is an example I cribbed from his paper: \u201cSeeking a 5-15 percent return over the course of 15 weeks betting college football is hard,\u201d he wrote in an email, \u201cespecially when it is risking tens of thousands of dollars to potentially win seven or eight hundred dollars.\u201d Everyone reading this column presumably knows that you aren\u2019t going to get rich betting heavy money-line favorites. For one thing, unless you already have a substantial bankroll, the price of entry for a decent payoff is very high. For another, no amateur has the willpower to make big dollar wagers that yield more consistent, yet smaller, returns. \u201cI chose 25 points because the offshores offered money-line prices on up to 25-point favorites,\u201d Wohl said. I asked Wohl where he got his data. He told me he spent a semester going through the Covers website, manually inputting the 1,591 games that had a spread between 10 and 25, as well as their money-line price. There is, however, a long-tail advantage \u2014 if you are willing to be patient, something most bettors have a problem with. Wohl found his advantage in betting the money lines for college football teams that were favored by 20-25 points. He wrote",
    "textAfterTable": "Wohl isn\u2019t looking to get rich quick by gambling. That would be nice, but he has a bigger end game. He wants to prove that you can invest in sports betting as a sound portion of an overall investment strategy. That is what he is going to do this year. In Vegas, with his own money. He will email with updates as the season progresses. I promised I would return them immediately.
