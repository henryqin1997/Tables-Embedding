The molar volume of gases is the number of liters occupied by 1 mole of the gas. Determining the molar volume of a gas is dividing the volume in liters by the number of moles gives the molar volume in liters per mole. Back to Top Molar Volume of a Gas The amagat should not be used to express molar volume or reciprocal molar volumes. For",
    "textAfterTable": "Molar Volume of Water Back to Top The extensive properties of one component system at a constant temperature and pressure depend only on the amount of the system present. For example, the volume of water depends on the quantity of water present. If the volume is expressed as a molar quantity however it is an intensive property. Thus molar volume of water at 1atm and 298K is 0.018 L mol-1 no matter how little or how much water is present. Molar Volume Table Back to Top Molar volume for certain gases are listed below.
