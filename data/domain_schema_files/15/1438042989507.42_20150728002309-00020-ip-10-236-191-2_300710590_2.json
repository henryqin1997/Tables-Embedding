They wrote up their plans in the Magazine \"Weltraumfahrt\" of the German post-war organisation \"Gesellschaft fuer Weltraumforschung\" (Society for Space Research) and it was published under the name \"Die Aussenstation\", later included in a book by Heinz Gartmann: \"Raumfahrtforschung\", Oldenburg, Muenchen 1952. Their rocket \ufffd the EBH launch vehicle \ufffd would have a gross launch weight of some 220 metric tonnes for a payload of 3 metric tonnes to a 557-kilometre orbit, with a period of 1.6 hours, giving 15 orbits per diem. They also calculated the launch weights for a second orbit of two hours period, 12 orbits per diem \ufffd interesting enough getting an orbital height of 1669 kilometres against von Braun's 1730 kilometres for the same period., 4894=Some different schools of thought can be discerned. Wernher von Braun, at the time already in the US, presented his monstrous three-stage \"rocket-ship\" in \"Das Marsprojekt\" 1948, at that time in a very stubby form which for aesthetic reasons was slimmed down for the well known Collier' s article series on space flight some years later. The von Braun launcher was rather conventional, three stages in tandem, but it tipped the scale at 6300 metric tonnes, The payload to an orbit with a period of 2 hours was to be some 33 tonnes, plus a cabin for some 10 to 12 people, explicitly \"men\". Much later, in 1955 -56, von Braun had to re-sketch his launcher for the Disney company, for copyright reasons. He then used the opportunity to downsize it to a gross launch weight of 1280 tonnes with a payload of some 10 tonnes., 26952=Status: Design 1949. Gross mass: 220,000 kg (480,000 lb). Payload: 3,000 kg (6,600 lb). Height: 25.00 m (82.00 ft). Thrust: 6,000.00 kN (1,348,800 lbf). Apogee: 557 km (346 mi)., 7526=Engel, B\ufffddewaldt and Hanisch did a thorough study on the ascent to orbit. The launch should be vertical, followed by a free trajectory leading up to heights with rarefied air. During the free ascent the rocket should be tilted over towards the east to take advantage of the rotation of the Earth. A more or less horizontal acceleration period would follow, so as not to carry excess amounts of propellants against the gravitation. After attaining circular orbit in an altitude of some 100 kilometres there would follow a short free flight period to be used for small corrections. From this very low parking orbit a short thrust period would raise the apogee to the final altitude, 557 or 1669 kilometres, where a kick manoeuvre would circularise the orbit. Launch was to take place in Woomera in Australia into an orbit with inclination 45 degrees to the equator.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "EBH-launch vehicle Modified after Gartmann \"Raumfahrtforschung\" art. \"Die Aussenstation\", table 6 (p 147) and text material in pp. 147...150 Masses in kg Looking at the numbers, one could imagine a vehicle with solid propellants for the stages giving an equal performance; of course the visible layout of the vehicle would be quite different from the flying artillery shell imagined by Engel, Boedewald and Hanisch. The number of stages seems excessive today, but it is well to remember that a four-stage vehicle, the Jupiter-C/Juno I, launched the first US satellite. The larger Juno-II was likewise a four-stage vehicle. Also, the principle of a launch trajectory with a free-flying phase with tilting between lofting to altitude and acceleration to orbit, was adhered to in both the Vanguard and the Juno vehicles. In its day, the EBH vehicle was hailed as the most realistic forecast to date, as the size was not too daunting, the propellants were well known and the construction and specific impulse seemed achievable. Today this plan is all but forgotten, when the much more futuristic monster rocket by von Braun, with it's then exotic propellants, nitric acid and hydrazine, crops up in most recapitulations of the prehistoric eras of astronautics. There was also a cost analysis. Taking the dry mass, and estimating the time and cost of producing it from the known amount of time needed to produce A4 (V2) missiles, and the then current aerospace",
