    "textAfterTable": "\u00a0 1. Alabama. Preseason www.valueaddbasketball.com ranked Alabama 30th and Kentucky 18th, which would make Alabama the favorite at home. Kentucky was almost exactly where we predicted at 16th in www.kenpom.com coming into the game, but Alabama was a disappointing 66th and projected to miss the tournament and be a 4-point underdog on their home court. Being able to beat the projection by eight points to pull out a huge 4-point win could put the Tide back on track to make the tournament. 2. Villanova. Even as the road team, No. 2 Louisville was a 14 point favorite over No. 81 Villanova. It would still be a long-shot for Villanova to make the tournament, but Louisville will need to bounce back to get back in line for a No. 1 seed. 3. Kansas. The Jayhawks were a 5-point favorite and won by four, so about what was expected. But that was a small and crucial margin of error visiting their rival for first place in the tough Big 12, so this is a huge win in a dangerous place for a 16th straight win to look every bit like a No. 1 seed and national contender. 4. Michigan State. The Spartans were a 5-point underdog going into Wisconsin to face a Badgers team that had just stunned the Hoosiers in Indiana. The huge 2-point win for 18th ranked Michigan State against the 15th ranked Badgers is key for seeds. 5. Illinois. While the Illini was favored",
