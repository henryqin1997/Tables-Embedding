Greenlight's SMPI reveals:, 5226=London, 10 August, 2010 - The number of UK online searches for PCs and laptops, DVD players and recorders, MP3 players, cameras and camcorders, totalled 11.4 million in June, a 24% decrease on May's 14.9 million. This is according to the latest independent research from Greenlight, a leading search and social marketing agency. Greenlight's 'Brown Goods Sector Report, June 2010', also shows May's search levels were likewise down by one million when compared to March's 16.5 million, which had gone up 9% on February's volume., 8624=\"There will be an increase in searches in the months leading up to Christmas, starting in September as there will be a significant number of consumers who will search for and purchase electrical goods as potential gifts\", says Simon Hollingsworth, lead Researcher at Greenlight. \"Retailers would be best advised to prepare now if they wish maximize their chances of netting a sizeable share of this traffic.\", 43771=\u00a9 Copyright 2015 Greenlight.

Of the top 10 advertisers, seven were retailers, two were brown goods manufacturers (although Sony and Dell also act as retailers) and one aggregator JohnLewis replaced Amazon to become the most visible advertiser for brown goods in paid search, attaining 50% visibility. With a 41% share of visibility, Amazon, in second position, lost 2% visibility since Greenlight's March report Despite considerable offline marketing activity, Comet and Dixons, the high street retailers, achieved low visibility in natural search, which saw their websites rank at positions 23 and 41 respectively Argos lost the greatest share of voice (9%) and therefore",

Greenlight's SMPI reveals: In social media, Amazon was the most followed brand, with a following of over 73,000 on Facebook. However, it produced just one post in June, thereby missing out on vital interaction with social media consumers Very was by far the most interactive brand. It cumulatively produced 486 'posts' and 'tweets' in June. It interacted with consumers well, as it promptly responded to queries and complaints, whilst it also promoted new product lines and special offers Many brands such as JohnLewis and PCWorld do not have active accounts on either Facebook or Twitter. This is a significant issue, particularly for Currys as it was isolated from consumers who posted negative commentary on its customer care services on unofficial Facebook pages (Table 2 below shows the most proactive brands in social media.
