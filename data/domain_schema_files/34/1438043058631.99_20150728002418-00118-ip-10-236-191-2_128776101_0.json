Notwithstanding the Company's current status outside the FTSE 350, the Board has determined that all Directors will retire and offer themselves for reappointment by shareholders on an annual basis. The Chairman meets at least annually with the Non-Executive Directors without Executive Directors present and the Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, K G Edelman, meet annually to consider the Chairman's performance, taking into account the Executive Directors' views. The Chairman conducts a formal appraisal process for the Board, its Committees and individual Directors, including Directors due to offer themselves for reappointment at the AGM, through use of a questionnaire and or one-to-one meetings which facilitates a Board discussion and, where appropriate, agreed actions for improvements. The Executive Directors are also included in the Company's annual performance appraisal arrangements, which include development and training requirements. All Board members receive agendas and comprehensive papers prior to each Board meeting. All Directors have access to the services of the Company Secretary who is responsible to the Board for ensuring that Board procedures are followed and that applicable rules and regulations are adhered to.
