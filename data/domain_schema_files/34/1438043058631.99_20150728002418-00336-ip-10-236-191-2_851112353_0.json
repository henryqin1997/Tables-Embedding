Athletic training includes the prevention, diagnosis, and intervention of emergency, acute, and chronic medical conditions involving impairment, functional limitations, and disabilities. To become an athletic trainer one must earn a degree in Athletic Training from a college or university with an education program accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE), and pass the national Board of Certification exam. The UWM ATEP received initial accreditation in 2003, and is currently in active status with the CAATE. The program will undergo re-accreditation review in 2017-2018., 2522=As of February 1, 2015 the Bachelor of Science in Athletic Training program has suspended admission. This means that unless you have been accepted into this degree program prior to February 1, 2015, you will not be able to earn a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Athletic Training at UWM. Students who are interested becoming Athletic Trainers will be advised to apply to the Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology program., 1946=To continue our leadership in Athletic Training education, we are revising our program to reflect the changed nature of professional practice demanding more interprofessional collaboration, a higher degree of autonomy requiring advanced development of clinical reasoning skills, and a skill set in evidence based practice that allows graduates to actively engage in the rapidly changing science surrounding health care practice. Therefore, we are in the process of establishing a graduate, professional education program where students would earn a Master of Science in Athletic Training. The program is going to be implemented during the 2015-2016 academic year, with the first students beginning the program for the Summer session of 2016.}",
