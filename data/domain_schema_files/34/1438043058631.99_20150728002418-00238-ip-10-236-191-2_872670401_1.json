The winner of the WSOP Main Event is considered to be the World Champion of Poker.[1], 2320=After the announcement was made to delay the final table, concerns arose as to how the delay would affect the tournament.[5] Ylon Schwartz, a 2008 November Nine participant, criticized the four-month delay by saying, \"It ruins the integrity of the tournament. The purity of old-time Las Vegas is gone. The antiquity and purity of the tournament have been liquidated into pure greed and capitalism.\"[6] However, ESPN's Senior Director of Programming and Acquisition, Doug White, stated, \"The movement of the final table has definitely helped in terms of creating buzz.\"[7], 5584=Prior to 2008, the entire Main Event was played without interruption. Starting in 2008, in an effort to build excitement in the WSOP and to increase ratings for the tape-delayed televised shows, Harrah's Entertainment and ESPN decided to delay the final table until shortly before its scheduled broadcast. The delay would allow ESPN to cover the rest of the tournament leading up to the final table without viewers knowing the winner in advance.[2] Due to the U.S. Presidential Election, the final table for the 2012 Main Event was held in October.[3][4], 1344=When the 2008 November Nine was broadcast \"almost live,\" ESPN received criticism because the network showed the winner's name prior to the broadcast. Poker journalist Dan Skolovy wrote, \"It turned out to be a difficult task to avoid hearing the results. Especially since... ESPN scrolled the winner on its sports ticker long before the broadcast aired.\"[2] Nonetheless, coverage of the 2008 final table garnered more than a 50\u00a0percent increase from the previous year in both the number of viewers and households that watched it.[8] The broadcast later received an Emmy Award nomination for \"Outstanding Live Event Turnaround.\"[9]}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{13039=Jeff Shulman, who entered the final table in fourth place, was the president for Card Player Magazine. Shulman openly stated that, if he won the bracelet, he would throw it away. Some initially speculated that this announcement stemmed from the fact that Harrah's Casino had partnered with Card Player Magazine's main competitor, Bluff Magazine.[13] However, an article on the Card Player website indicated that Shulman's supposed disdain for Harrah's Casino was not based on its partnership with Bluff Magazine. \u201cMy comments have nothing to do with that, and everything to do with my disappointment in how the World Series is run,\" said Shulman. \"It used to be run by people who loved and really cared about poker, and had the players in mind, first and foremost. That mission's been derailed by a few executives who now head the Series.\"[15] He also indicated that, if he won the bracelet, he would not throw it in the trash, but instead would pursue one of four options: hold an auction and donate the money to charity, hold a tournament for the players shut out of the 2009 WSOP Main Event, give it away as part of a promotion on SpadeClub.com (an online poker site sponsored by Cardplayer), or give it to television personality Stephen Colbert.[15], 23630=Eoghan O'Dea's father, Donnacha O'Dea, played the Main Event final table in 1983 and 1991, making them the first father-son duo to make the final table.[17] In addition, Martin Staszko, Badih Bounahra and Anton Makiievskyi were the first players to make the Main Event final table from the countries of Czech Republic, Belize and Ukraine, respectively.[18][19][20][21] With seven different countries represented, this was the most internationally diverse Main Event final table in WSOP history.[22], 37121=Mark Newhouse became the first player to make two consecutive Main Event final tables since Dan Harrington in 2003 and 2004. Bruno Politano is the first Main Event finalist from Brazil.}",

Peter Eastgate, from Denmark, was one of only two non-North American players to make it to the final table (Russian Ivan Demidov was the other).[10] By making the final table, Eastgate and 23-year-old Craig Marquis threatened Phil Hellmuth's 19-year record as youngest person to ever win the WSOP Main Event;[10] Eastgate's victory gave him that distinction. Ylon Schwartz was a former professional chess hustler in New York City parks.[10] Two players, accountant Darus Suharto and poker professional Scott Montgomery, were originally from Canada. Kelly Kim, who had the fewest number of chips entering the final table, was an established professional player who cashed in numerous events but never won a major tournament.[10] 2009[edit] Main articles: 2009 World Series of Poker and 2009 World Series of Poker results Original field: 6,494 Total prize pool: $61,043,600 Final table minimum prize: $1,263,602 Final table maximum prize: $8,547,042 Final table total prize pool: $27,220,989 Reference:[12] Name Starting chip",
