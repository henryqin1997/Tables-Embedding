Note that these are US Army - not US Navy - ships: Liberty USAT: Class 1618 Available: 4/42 Endurance: 14000 Fuel: 1400 Capacity: 3750 Upgrade to: 1618 Weapons: The same as the Crater AK class The following ships, formerly Crater AK class, are now Liberty USAT class:, 106817=All \"Squad\" type devices now have a two-digit year abbreviation added to the end of their description, making it easier to identify the type of squads making up a unit. The year corresponds to the year that the squad type becomes available (with all starting squads using \"41\", but all other squads that first appear in December using the following year)., 229310=HMS Warspite now begins the scenario in Seattle, with a small amount of SYS damage. HMS Warspite was in Seattle finishing repairs at the start of the Pacific war, and later sailed to India via Australia in early 1942., 736997=Corrected HMS Vanguard secondary Armament: Class 1448 - Weapons 3 and 4, number adjusted to 8, 706597=The 47th Pursuit Squadron was temporarily based at Haleiwa Field although the pilots took their rest and recreation at Wheeler Field. On 7 December they had to return quickly in order to get airborne. The 47th provided the only really effective airborne resistance to the Japanese that day., 738887=2018 - USMC Infantry Division TOE 2160 - United State Base Force, 35217=11th Bombardment Squadron USAAF arrival date changed from 411208 to 411209 so that it appears in the game., 711060=With Japan\u2019s surrender, the British captured 23,000 INA survivors. As Bose had died in a plane crash in the waning days of the war, the British tried three of his subordinates for treason. To the surprise of both the British and the pro-independence Indian Congress party the \u201cRed Fort\u201d trials revealed mass support for the INA veterans as Indian patriots. After many protests, a widespread mutiny within the Royal Indian Navy, and a sit-down strike within the Air Force, the trio were acquitted in 1946., 36122=The Spitfire Vb has been provided with a starting pool of 11 aircraft. These now allow for some replacements to No.457 Squadron RAAF before January 1943, which is the availability date of the aircraft as of CHS 2.04., 707200=Converted Japanese Leaders 1033, 1015, 682, 526 as follows:, 25334=All Indian Air base forces renamed using the format \"No. 1xx RIAF Base Force\". All now use formation number 2064 as their formation template., 732641=Ichang starts as Japanese. The Japanese captured Ichang in June of 1940., 723023=Daily fuel and supply values at the United States base increased by 2000 each, pending further investigation of US supply levels., 263067=The Japanese also receive 100 Daily Oil at the base of Shikuka on Sakhalin, to represent the Okha oil concessions that they extraced up until 1944. To take into account these changes, the size of the Okha oil field has been considerably reduced., 189242=The arrival date of HMS Vanguard has been put back a month to a more realistic date of 451101., 265159=Q 111 and Q 112 were slightly different prototypes built in Britain - 8 additional boats ordered were taken over by the British when war began in 1939., 265509=Q 113 was then ordered as a prototype in the Philippines (to the same design as Q 112) and completed in October, 1941 Following the completion of Q 113, ten additional boats were ordered with expected completion in March, 1942. Plans were made for a follow-on order of 14 more. None of these vessels were ever completed., 47803=The following LCUs have had their Arrival dates changed to 0 (were in the range 411201 to 411207):, 739327=Corrected Position of 383rd Heavy Bomb Squadron - it must be in slot 1618 to handle the atomic bomb. Switched positions of VMF-215 (in slot 1618) and 393rd Heavy Bomb Sqd (in slot 1686)., 181222=The arrival date of the 2nd Marine Para Bn changed to 421109 instead of 421108., 738308=Added two additional brigades - these were formed in early 1942 from garrison units (most of which are not now in the OOB):, 56311=The US command HQs South Pacific and Southwest Pacific now arrive as reinforcements on 420420 and 411122 respectively. All on-map air groups belonging to these two HQs have been reallocated to Central Pacific HQ. All on-map LCUs, and LCU reinforcements arriving before the HQs themselves, that belong to these two HQs have been reallocated to Central Pacific HQ, and set to switch to the South Pacific or Southwest Pacific HQ after it arrives. In addition the bases formerly assigned to the South Pacific HQ have been reassigned to Central Pacific. To compensate for the Political Points required to properly set up the command areas of these two HQs after they arrive on map, the Allied player has been given a number of additional PPs at the scenario start. Although the Allied player could spend some or all of these PPs on other things, that would result in a reduced ability to operate effectively (i.e. within a HQ radius) in the Pacific. Because of the increased flexibility this provides the Allied player, the number of additional PPs given to the Allied player are fewer than the number required to restore the air group, LCU and base HQ allocations for the South Pacific and Southwest Pacific HQs., 732735=Wenchow starts as Chinese. The Japanese did not occupy Wenchow until July of 1942. Also, the fuel and supply stockpile at Wenchow has been reduced by a factor of 10., 50358=The \"2nd Marine Para\" LCU has had its arrival date changed from 411208 to 411209, so that it will arrive on map., 223802=A new Allied AP class - the Crater AP - has been created, with the following characteristics: Crater AP: Class 1617 Available: 4/42 Endurance: 14000 Fuel: 1400 Capacity: 3000 Upgrade to: 1617 Weapons: The same as the Crater AK class The following ships, formerly Crater AK class, are now Crater AP class:, 246235=* These aircraft have had their build rates increased to allow for the filling out of the new groups and squadrons arriving from the ETO in 1945 (see above)., 46414=The availability date of the SB2C Helldiver is now 8/43 instead of 1/43. Although it was first assigned to squadrons in early 1943 there were problems with thei aircraft and delays in their deployment. The production rate has been increased from 200 to 240 to compensate for this later availability., 710696=By December of 1943 the Japanese agreed that the INA was well-enough trained and equipped to be committed to battle. In January, headquarters and the First Division were shifted to Rangoon, and brigades were sent forward to participate in the 1944 Arakan and Imphal campaigns. The INA fought against the British advance in Burma until the war\u2019s end., 708601=When Singapore fell, the Japanese had captured 67,000 Indian soldiers serving in the British army. Some 40,000 of the captives, either willingly or under duress, joined the Indian National Army (or Azad Hind Fauz), organized to liberate India from British rule. Mistrust between the Indian military leaders and their Japanese patrons prevented the effective organization of the INA until the charismatic and respected Indian nationalist Netaji (\u201cGreat Leader\u201d) Subhas Chandra Bose reached Tokyo from Germany in May, 1943. Bose was one of the pre-war leaders of the Indian independence movement. He opposed Gandhi\u2019s philosophy of non-violent resistance, (while, ironically, admiring him enough to name a brigade after him) and fled India to escape arrest by the British.}",
