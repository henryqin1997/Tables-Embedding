Also, thanks to the controller, Janet , for her helpful suggestions on the courses and map, and to Nancy's organising team for coping with the crises on the day. The map still needs an overhaul, but I hope its minor deficiencies did not detract from your enjoyment of the area. I thought the wood was just about at its best and hope the heavy machinery stays out of it for another year or two, unless to clear out some of the unsightly debris of human activity. And finally, of course, thanks to you, the competitors, for coming to the event and making all the hard work of the SOS team worthwhile.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Organiser's comments - Nancy Powell Davies As usual, a number of stalwart helpers came along to make sure that the event ran as smoothly as possible. I am grateful to everyone who made my 'maiden voyage' as an organiser so much easier. At least next time I shall have more idea what's involved. I must especially single out Colin and Lyn West for answering my early morning plea and coming to my rescue. The weather was kind to us and it was lovely that the only problems that we had were because the event was more popular than we expected. I hope that not too many people were disappointed in having to wait for their run or change course. We will try to learn for next time. I look forward to seeing you all in the woods another time. Planner's Comments - Martin Sellens Firstly, humble apologies to those of you who were unable to run on your course of choice because of the lack of maps. I had planned map numbers on the basis of the last two Straggler's Club Champs/colour coded events but clearly failed to take into account other variables like good weather and lack of other events in the area. Many thanks to those who agreed to sell back their maps. If you want a copy of the map with your course email me at sellm@essex.ac.uk and I'll send you one. Let me know if you can read OCAD8.",
