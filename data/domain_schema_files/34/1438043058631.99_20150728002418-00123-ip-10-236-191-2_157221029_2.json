            "Misty Plains The large emerald clearing is surrounded by dense forest and rolling hills. A small creek runs through the forest, marking an easy pathway in our out of the lands. There are no permanant predators in these lands, however, they do tend to pass through. The land is rich with life and the forest brings shelter from most storms. Mist settles over the larger plain almost every morning. Claimed By: unclaimed Moderator: lynx''",
            "Snowgum Valley Tucked neatly away between two high mountains, lays Snowgum Valley, given the name by a single snowgum tree that shadows over a large pond in the south of the lands. There are plenty caves for shelter here, and a small cluster of trees for when the weather gets too bad. Claimed By: Wooden Moderator: lynx''",
            "Sunset Meadows These fields are large and flat, making it easy to be spotted; there are no trees here, so shelter is best seeked in other lands. However, the grass here is lushious and neverending and a small lake is in the north of the lands. Claimed By: unclaimed Moderator: lynx''",
            "The Forgotton Valley This secret place is mystical, many great equines have ruled here before, it is one of the oldest places on Midnight Acres. The great mountains and surrounding woods protect all inside from most dangers. Food, shelter and water is plentiful. Blooming flowers are everywhere, there is amazing scenery, and a small lake is created by a magnificent waterfall that crashes at the edge of the lands. This land is truely Magical. Claimed By: Black Champagne. Moderator: lynx''",
            "Elixar Grove This luscious land is hidden from most prying eyes, tucked neatly away between two large hills. One end is on a severe decline, keeping it filled with water, making flash floods a constant danger, whilst the other half is on higher ground, with a few patches of trees for shelter. There isn't much vegetation here, especially in the fall months, but life is incredibly easy here. Claimed By: Ketamine. Moderator: lynx''"

There is always an eerie feeling that you are being watched, then again, it might just be the bats, hiding in the thick trees. A dense fog covers the realm in early morning and during the night, making it hard to navigate at times. This land is rather boggy at times, when it rains, it pours, there are small patches of forest where shelter can be found, and a river crashes around the main meadow. Claimed By: Dark December}",
