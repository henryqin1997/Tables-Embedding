The quantity of municipal waste was 349 kg/inhabitant or 0.9 kg/inhabitant per day in 2008.

There are 58 municipal landfills for municipal and other non-hazardous waste (Notification on the annual quantity of municipal waste generated in 2008, June 2009). Collection of non-separated municipal and non-hazardous waste, as well as non-separated non-hazardous and hazardous waste fractions is a general practice.

Composting and anaerobic digestion of biodegradable waste are not practiced in the country and there is, no formal system yet for collection and recycling packaging waste. There are no organised systems for the collection of construction and demolition waste or for the collection and treatment of agricultural and livestock waste.
