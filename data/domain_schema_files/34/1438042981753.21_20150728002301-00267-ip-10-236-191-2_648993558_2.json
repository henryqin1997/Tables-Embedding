            "Luke Tasker and Georgia Pipes took part in today\u2019s Mixed Relay at the Junior European Championships. Despite a fantastic result in the swim, where they placed second, Tasker and Pipes couldn\u2019t quite make the podium. The result topped off a week of mixed emotions for the squad, who struggled to claim a medal after Joanna Muir and Francesca Summers\u2019 silver in the Women\u2019s Relay. Istvan Nemeth, Women\u2019s Team Head Coach, said: \u201cJoanna and Frankie\u2019s relay silver was the result of their perseverance during the day, after a mediocre start in the fencing. \u201cOur Women\u2019s Team is quite young; Frankie, Eilidh and Georgia are first year Juniors and they have really only just started to become Pentathletes. All four of them qualified to the final with relative ease, but during the final our opponents' vigour left us playing the supporting part. \u201cIt was a very good and an important experience for the girls. In August at the Junior World Championships we will see what lessons we have learned from Sofia. \u201cOur three boys (Tommy Lees, Luke Tasker and Harry Sykes), just like the girls, have learned that there is plenty of room for improvement.\u201d",
            "Tommy Lees, Luke Tasker and Harry Sykes made a promising start in the Junior European Championships earlier this week, when Lees and Tasker placed fourth in the Men's Relay and followed up their success by qualifying for the Men's Individual Final. But t wasn't meant to be, as both Lees and Tasker missed out on a medal in a tough final in Bulgaria today. The boys performed well in qualification, with Luke Tasker coming 1st in the swim and Harry Sykes delivering a solid performance at his first ever major championships. Tommy Lees' consistent results in each of the disciplines saw him qualify from Group B in an impressive 8th place. Both Tasker and Lees had a tricky start to today's final, with Tasker scoring 10 victories in the fence and Lees trailing behind with 9. The boys then went on to compete in the swim, managing to emulate the consistently good results of all GB's athletes during the championships. Tasker just edged Lees finishing 5th, while Lees came in 8th. It was on to the show jumping and both Tasker and Lees backed up their strong performances in the swim by jumping clear. Lees completed the course with the third fastest time, while Tasker came 8th. Overall this put them at 30th and 28th in the table respectively. It was always going to be a hard challenge in the combined event but Lees fought back to climb his way up the final table. After completing the run/shoot in 12:05 Lees pushed his overall ranking up to 26th. Tasker crossed the line 20 seconds later which saw him drop on place to 29th. It was Poland's Sebastian Stasiak who took home the gold after a great start to the competition where he secured 24 victories in the fence. It will be onwards and upwards for GB's men as they turn their attention to preparations for the Junior World Championships which will be held in Mexico at the beginning of August. A full list of results can be found on the ECMP website.",
            "After a dream start to the Junior European Championships, the GB Women were unable to match their silver medal triumph in today's individual final competition. All four women found success in the qualification round, with Francesca Summers topping Group A and Georgia Pipes qualifying for her first ever major final. Eilidh Prise and Joanna Muir matched their success in Group B, with Prise qualifying in 2nd place and Muir qualifying in 6th. After the first discipline of today\u2019s final Summers secured 9th place following a successful 21 bouts. Muir finished the fence in 23rd, Prise in 26th and Pipes in 27th. Muir then started her climb back up the table with an impressive 4th place finish in the swim, while Summers dropped to 16th. Debutant Georgia Pipes also had a successful swim which placed her 22nd overall, one place ahead of team-mate Prise. All four went on to have a fantastic round in the show jumping, with Muir, Pipes and Prise all going clear. The team went into the combined event in a good position; Muir in 14th with 792 points, Pipes in 17th, Prise in 18th and Summers trailing in 32nd. Muir showed her grit and determination to cross the line 9th in the run/shoot, bringing her up to 6th overall. Prise crossed the line paces behind Muir, finishing the competition in a respectable 12th. Pipes and Summers finished to take 30th and 31st place in the final table. A full list of results is available on the ECMP website. It's the turn of the men tomorrow and GB's Luke Tasker and Tommy Lees will be hoping to bring home individual medals. You can following the action as it happens via the Pentathlon GB Twitter feed or live on the Pentathlon BG website.",
            "With five weeks until the Modern Pentathlon World Championships in Berlin, kicking off from 28 June, the GB squad has been announced. Current World Champion and Olympic silver medallist Samantha Murray will be joined by Kate French, Freyja Prentice and Francesca Summers, who makes her debut at the Senior World Championships. The women have enjoyed a successful start to the season, with Murray topping the table at the First World Cup and French placing third. Thomas Toolis, James Cooke, Joseph Choong and Joseph Evans have been selected for the men\u2019s team. Toolis, Cooke and Evans will also be heading to the World Cup Final, held in Minsk between 11 and 14 June. Marian Gheorghe, Men\u2019s Team Head Coach, said: \u201cWe have had good results up until now, particularly in the fencing and combined events, but we are only in the middle of the season and we have to continue to get good results. \u201cFor the men\u2019s team, I would like all four of them to qualify for the final and I think it would be the first time in history for that to happen. From there, anything can happen, but the first step is to qualify for the final. I would like each of them to have an opportunity to prove that the British men\u2019s team are a force to be reckoned with, not just the women.\u201d Both squads will now head to Font Romeu in France for an intensive training camp at altitude in preparation for the competition. The 2015 World Championships will be broadcast live on the UIPM YouTube channel. The championships begin on Sunday 28 June, with the Men\u2019s final on Friday 3 July and the Women\u2019s final on Saturday 4 July. Pentathlon GB has also announced a strong squad for the Junior European Championships, held in Sofia, Bulgaria between 25 and 31 May. Joanna Muir will be looking to improve on last year\u2019s 14th position with added confidence after her triumphant performance at the Swiss Women\u2019s International competition earlier this year. Joining her on the women\u2019s team will be Francesca Summers, Eilidh Prise and Georgia Pipes, who makes her debut at a major championship competition. The men\u2019s team has been named as Luke Tasker, Tommy Lees and Harry Sykes, who will also be competing in a major competition for the first time.",

            "Pentathlon GB For immediate use: Sunday 3 May, 2015 Toolis top Brit in men\u2019s final at World Cup 4 in Kecskem\u00e9t, Hungary. Tom Toolis was the highest-placed Brit in the men\u2019s final today finishing 13th overall, his best ever result in a World Cup. Toolis performed strongly in the fencing to record 19 wins that moved him from 18th up to 11th place, a position that he held after a fine ride that scored him 294 points. He finished the run/shoot in 11:26.08, which scored him 1450 points overall. Jamie Cooke, a World Cup winner earlier in the season, finished 27th overall with 1409 points, with team mate Sam Curry coming home in 35th place with 1367 points. Cooke started the day superbly recording the fastest time in the swim of 1:56.82, but dropped down to 25th place after winning only 12 of his fencing bouts. Curry also dropped places after the fencing to 34th, and neither could better their positions after Cooke finished 19th and Curry 28th in the run/shoot. \u201cIt was definitely an interesting weekend,\u201d said Jan Bartu, the GB Performance Director. \u201cIt was a tough competition for the athletes, as all of the nations are now gearing up for the big competitions ahead.\u201d Bartu was pleased with Tom Toolis\u2019s performance. \u201cThis is Tom\u2019s second consecutive solid performance at this level and he has made the most significant improvement so far this season.\u201d In the women\u2019s final yesterday, Kate French produced a strong run/shoot to finish as the highest-placed Brit in 13th, three places ahead of teenager Francesca Summers. Reigning World Champion Samantha had to settle for 29th place after being eliminated in the ride, and Mhairi Spence eventually finished 24th overall in her first World Cup for 12 months. Murray had made an excellent start to Saturday\u2019s competition by recording comfortably the fastest time in the swim of 2:08.73, but saw her chances disappear in the ride as she was eliminated on Zermatt, meaning she picked up no points and went into the final run/shoot ranked 31st. Spence was fourth going into the combined event but, in her first World Cup for 12 months, struggled for pace and eventually finished 24th overall. \u201cIt was a good experience for all of the athletes,\u201d said Bartu, \u201cbut we are looking forward to the big championships now.\u201d The World Cup Final will take place in Minsk, Belarus from June 11-14. A key event on the road to Rio will be the Modern Pentathlon European Championships, taking place at the University of Bath from August 18-23.",
            "Intensity of the men\u2019s semi-finals has been extraordinary so far this World Cup Season. No mistake or moment slump in performance goes unpunished in the terms of achieving places in the Finals. Athletes know too well that every victory in the fencing, second in the swimming or missed shot in the combined event may be difference between make it or break it. Then there is a compensation factor each athlete needs to have in the armoury. Nowadays it seems to be exceptionally strong running. We have some excellent runners in the competition good enough to tackle 8:40min in 3000m athletic track race, standard of performance unthinkable 10 years ago. Lactate tolerance, lower leg strength, core strength, maximum oxygen consumption, running economy and transitions from running to shooting phase and return to running have been improving over the past 3 to 4 years dramatically. Watch this space, characteristics of the future athlete in Modern Pentathlon are emerging. For the finalists the day is long and demanding. Fencing Bonus Round, introduced by the Union in preparations for the 2016 Rio Games, in addition of the pool unique, has been tested in the 2015 World Cup Series. We are still learning how potential gain of 1 to 5 seconds in the Bonus Round would affect the overall Pentathlon results. Bonus Round adds, at this testing stage, about one and half hours to the competition schedule when conducted in One Day Format. There is some outstanding work to be done on the point tables to ensure fairness to all athletes irrelevant to their placing after pool unique and investigate an option to seed the athletes for the Bonus Round after two disciplines. It was a hit and miss competition for the girls. Samantha rode exceptionally well until taking a wrong turn after the obstacle 6 hearing liberating sound of the bell as a result. Kate struggled through the fencing but fought back in the combined event finishing in respectable 13th place. Mhairi experienced a good day returning from prolonged recovery but not yet in full fitness. Francesca should be happy with the 16th place finish. She was well balanced and had some fan too. In the heat of the fencing battle she had a core and core contact with one of the athletes who ended up flat face down on the piste. Frankie did not hesitate a second, followed through hitting gently her adversary helplessly lying on the piste. It was not attempt to score but a clear reminder to her opponent: do not mess with me I bite. Jamie, Tom and Sam compete today in the prestigious final stage of the World Cup 4 in Kecskemet, Hungary, all the best!",
            "It was a day of ups and downs for Pentathlon GB in the women\u2019s final of World Cup 4 in Kecskem\u00e9t, Hungary. There were good individual performances across the disciplines, with Kate French producing a strong run/shoot to finish as the highest-placed Brit in 13th, three places ahead of teenager Francesca Summers. Mhairi Spence was fourth going into the combined event but, in her first World Cup for 12 months, struggled for pace and eventually finished 24th overall. And reigning World Champion Samantha Murray had to settle for 29th place after being eliminated in the ride. She had made an excellent start to Saturday\u2019s competition by recording comfortably the fastest time in the swim of 2:08.73. Spence was 12th in 2:16.79, French 31st in 2:21.49 and Summers 33rd in 2:23.22. Spence and Summers impressed in the fencing, winning 23 and 22 bouts respectively to climb up the rankings. Murray won 16 and French 15. Murray was still well placed overall but saw her chances disappear in the ride as she was eliminated on Zermatt, meaning she picked up no points and went into the final run/shoot ranked 31st. Spence and French both scored 293 points, on Jagello and Boby respectively, while Summers added 282 points to her tally on Londi. That meant she started the final discipline in 16th, a position the 19-year-old maintained by completing the run/shoot in 13:02 to finish with 1,298 points. French was 22nd but surged up nine places to 13th overall on 1,312 points after producing the fourth-fastest run/shoot of the day in 12:30. Murray was 11th fastest in 12:48, meaning she climbed two places to finish 29th on 1,044 points. Spence was five places ahead on 1,266. The men\u2019s final is on Sunday, with Britain represented by Jamie Cooke, Sam Curry and Tom Toolis.",
            "The British trio of Jamie Cooke, Tom Toolis and Sam Curry have qualified for Sunday\u2019s final of World cup 4 in Kecskmet, Hungary. Jamie Cooke, winner of the first world cup of 2015, qualified comfortably in Group A. Cooke started strongly recording 16 wins in the fencing and posted the second fastest time in the swim, which put him first going into the combined run-shoot. He finished fifth overall with 1151 points. Tom Toolis, also in Group A, produced a fine combined run-shoot to climb the rankings and finish 10th overall and secure his place in the final with 1141 points. In Group B Sam Curry finished in 10th place overall with 1157 points to see him through to the final. Curry performed strongly in the fencing competition to record 19 wins and in the swim, which sat him in fifth after the first two disciplines. There was disappointment though for Nick Woodbridge as he finished 19th in Group C and will not progress further. Yesterday in Kecskmet, all four British women qualified safely for tomorrow\u2019s final. Samantha Murray and Mhairi Spence were particularly impressive in Group C, with Murray taking first spot with 1,045 points and Spence \u2013 in her first World Cup for 12 months \u2013 fourth on 1,031. Kate French, a bronze medallist from world cup 1 and Francesca Summers, making only her second world cup appearance, join them in the final after finishing seventh and 12th respectively in Group A.",

            "Pentathlon GB National Training Centre at the University of Bath inaugurated a new Combined Event Facility located on the side of athletic track aiming to provide additional training opportunity to the top British athletes. Built has been fairly lengthy process associated with refurbishment of the Open Air Combined Event Range, resurfacing of the athletic track, installation of the 2012 Olympic Games legacy swimming pool and adjacent Sports Training Village support areas. This has been mammoth project undertaken by the UK Sport Elite Training Centre initiative, University of Bath and its Sports Development Department led by Stephen Baddeley, funding partners, Sport England and National Governing Bodies of Skeleton-Bobsleigh, Swimming, Athletics and Modern Pentathlon. We can\u2019t be thankful enough to the National Lottery Sports Fund for continues generation of so vital support to the British sporting community and in particularly, to the Pentathlon GB programmes. In contrast to recent undoubtedly positive developments and fruitful efforts to add upgraded training facilities to existing portfolio we are occasionally confronted with frustrating lack of appreciation and understanding on the part of the very individuals for whom the negotiations, planning, investments and constructions are undertaken. I am not the only one amongst the Performance Directors who would share concerns about programme athletes that have become accustom to take provided support and opportunities for granted. Risks of diluting the athletes\u2019 focus on the delivery of utmost quality training programmes meanwhile waste unnecessary time and energy on discussions why and where this or that can\u2019t be done is growing. It is very simple the top performance can be only achieved when fundamental hours of dedicated training have been completed. Some of the training volume needs to be purposefully conducted under duress of bad weather conditions and imperfect training facilities. Exposing athletes to additional challenges stimulates their adaptability and coping skills, elementary virtues for any aspiring champion. To me the proposition of conscious continues increase of the training demands is the way forward. I sincerely believe the Rio hopefuls embrace the concept and make it work. Samantha and Mhairi controlled their destiny in the semi-finals from the leading positions thanks to strong fencing and swimming. It could be advantage in the finals to be able dig in to energy reserves not depleted in the qualification round. Kate and Francesca have done exactly opposite in the battle for top qualification places. They had to run flat out in the closing stages of the combined event to secure passage to the Saturday\u2019s finals. That is now history and girls have a day to replenish, relax and have a massage treatment. It will be interesting Final of the World Cup 4 with currently the most experienced British female athlete Mhairi Spence and the youngest contender on the team Francesca Summers going head to head. I suspect it\u2019ll be rather exciting to watch, don\u2019t miss. Good luck today to the Men's Team."
