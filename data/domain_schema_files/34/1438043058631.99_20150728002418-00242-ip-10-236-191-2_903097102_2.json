Tell GHC that you prefer the system libraries first: ghc HelloWorld.hs -L/usr/lib 2012-04-17: The MacPorts version of wxWidgets 2.9.3 can be used. I added a few flags to the Portfile, but they are probably not necessary. 2012-04-14: On MacOS X Lion, to install wxWidgets 2.9 with HomeBrew, you may need to run brew install wxmac --use-llvm --devel 4 Using wxHaskell on MacOS X platforms Even though graphical applications on MacOS X look great, it is a still a developers nightmare to get them working\u00a0:-). This page describes how to circumvent some of the pitfalls. Executables generated with GHC do not work when executed directly if they use the graphical API; they need to be upgraded into so called application bundles for MacOS X. Use the cabal-macosx package to automate this. It can be integrated with Cabal and/or used as a standalone macosx-app script. Note: The following no longer applies to wxcore >= 0.90.0.1. Due to complicated MacOS X restrictions, graphical wxHaskell applications do not work directly when used from GHCi. Fortunately, Wolfgang Thaller has kindly provided an ingenious",
