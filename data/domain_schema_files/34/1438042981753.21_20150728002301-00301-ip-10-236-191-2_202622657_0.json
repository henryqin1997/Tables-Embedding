    "textBeforeTable": "\u00a0 \u00a0 Tim Stauffer \u2013 Similar to the guy right above, Stauffer has found some type of home in the bullpen, could be a dollhouse, could be a doghouse, who knows. \u00a0Maybe he had one of those origami paper games that determined where he lived, the ones that you wrote words on each panel. \u00a0NE-ways, Stauffer has a 18k/9 rate over the last 14 games as he tries show the Friars that he may want back in on the whole starting thing, 2 holds during that same time make him an interesting guy come next year. \u00a0Stay tuned. Luke Hochevar \u2013 Member this whip-tard, yeah, seems like I wrote about him every other week in the 2-start thread. \u00a0Well, he has found his role, now the better question is will he remain a reliever or be given the keys to jump back into the rotation next year. \u00a0I am going to go out on a limb and say that he becomes a starter, and for all you RP/SP hoarders that is a great thing. Has 3 holds in the last 10 as compared to only 6 all year so that news is encouraging. With an ERA below 2 on the year and \u00a0a career ERA of over 5 as a starter, maybe something clicked. Who knows, but numbers help with his sexiness for now. Sean Doolittle \u2013 This guy always seems to be lying in the weeds and then jumps out at you you",
