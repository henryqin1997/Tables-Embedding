Its molecular formula, C30H46O5, was determined by HRESIMS (m/z 509.3243 [M+Na]+, calcd. for 509.3246), corresponding to eight degrees of unsaturation. The IR spectrum showed absorption bands for hydroxyl (3426 cm\u22121) and carbonyl (1712 cm\u22121, broad) functional groups. The 1H-NMR spectrum revealed signals due to an olefinic proton [\u03b4H 5.49 (d, J = 2.0 Hz)], seven tertiary methyls (\u03b4H 0.86, 1.01, 1.16, 1.27, 1.39, 1.40, and 1.47), a hydroxymethylene [\u03b4H 3.74 (d, J = 10.4 Hz), 3.82 (d, J = 10.4 Hz)], and an oxygenated methines [\u03b4H 4.91 (dd, J = 10.8, 2.4 Hz)] (Table 1). The 13C-NMR spectrum indicated the presence of 30 carbon atoms, including one trisubstituted double bond (\u03b4C 121.4 and 149.8), seven methyls, nine methylenes (one oxygenated), four methines (one oxygenated), and eight quaternary carbons (two carbonyl carbons) (Table 2). Previous studies [28,29] showed two carbonyls groups at \u03b4C 170.6 and 182.0 together with the absence of absorption bands for carboxylic groups in the IR spectrum, which indicated the presence of an anhydride moiety in the molecule. Eight degrees of unsaturation were implied by the molecular formula. As well as two carbonyls and one olefinic group, compound 7 possesses a pentacyclic system. This data indicated that this compound belongs to the olean-12-ene family of triterpenoids, with an embedded anhydride function and two additional hydroxyl groups [28,29]. In the HMBC spectrum of 7, the correlations for H-11 (\u03b4H 4.91)/C-12 (\u03b4C 121.4), and for H-12 (\u03b4H 5.49)/C-9 (\u03b4C 45.9) and C-18 (\u03b4C 47.2) indicated that a hydroxyl group was attached at C-11. The HMBC correlations of both H-29 and H-30 with C-19 and C-20 also indicated that the hydroxymethylene group was attached at C-20. On the basis of the previous study [30], the chemical shift of the C-29 (equatorial) hydroxymethylene group resonated at around 75 ppm and the value of the C-30 (axial) methyl group was found at around 20 ppm in the 13C-NMR spectrum. In contrast, the chemical shift of the C-30 hydroxymethylene group appeared at around 67 ppm, while the C-29 methyl group appeared at around 28 ppm. Therefore, the remaining hydroxyl group in 7 was placed at C-30. Detailed analysis of the correlations of the HMBC spectrum gave the location of the anhydride at C-2 and C-3 (Figure 3). The orientation of a hydroxyl group at C-11 was assumed to be \u03b1 on the basis of the NOESY correlations between H-11 and H-25. In according with all these data, the structure of 7 was established as 11\u03b1,30-dihydroxy-2,3-seco-olean-12-en-2,3-dioic anhydride.}",
