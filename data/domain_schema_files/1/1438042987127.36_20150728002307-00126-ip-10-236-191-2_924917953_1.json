    "textBeforeTable": "Water quality at nearby bathing waters Take to the beaches for kayaking, sailing, windsurfing and even scuba diving opportunities - just don\u2019t forget your wetsuit, you\u2019ll need it. Top surfing beaches include Newport, Broad Haven and Tenby South. Bikes and surfboards can be taken on some bus services too, so you\u2019ll be able to get to and from the waves hassle-free. For those who prefer to sightsee more safely, visiting St Govan's chapel is a must. Tucked into the cliffs, you might easily mistake this little place for \u2018just another rock\u2019, but look a little closer and you\u2019ll find a quirky sixth-century chapel. The folklore surrounding St Govan, the hermit and saint who once lived in the here, make for light entertainment as you explore the tiny, hidden building. Want to take to greater heights? Bosherston is a tiny village just south of Pembroke but it provides a real hub for the local climbing scene. Challenge yourself to some of the toughest climbing routes in the country, including Huntsman\u2019s Leap, but beware, these limestone cliffs are not for the faint-hearted. Two miles north of Hangmans Hall you\u2019ll reach Pembroke. Standing tall on a rocky ridge overlooking the town, surrounded by three sides of water, is its magnificent Norman castle. Not just for history buffs, from the top of the keep you can capture some incredible views, including Pembroke\u2019s historic Town Wall. Tudor and Georgian houses, caf\u00e9s, restaurants, pubs and shops line Main Street, which runs",
