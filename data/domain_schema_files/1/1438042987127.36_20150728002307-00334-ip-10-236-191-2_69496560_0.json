Because of their high energy consumption, residential, public, and commercial buildings also offer unparalleled opportunities for energy savings. According to the International Energy Agency, buildings account for some 41 percent of global energy savings potential by 2035, compared with the industrial sector (24 percent) and the transport sector (21 percent). This guidance note outlines how cities can tap into a wide array of proven technologies, policies, and financing mechanisms to improve energy efficiency and capture cost-effective energy savings in buildings. It offers city leaders advice on how to get started in introducing energy efficiency measures, and provides lessons and examples from successful programs that have been introduced worldwide.\u00a0 \u66f4\u5c11\u663e\u793a, 11788=The urban population in the developing world is expected to more than double by the middle of the twenty-first century, from 2.3 billion in 2005 to 5.3 billion in 2050. ...\u00a0\u66f4\u591a\u663e\u793a Large cities are growing very rapidly, and services are struggling to keep up. In particular, some cities have been overwhelmed by the increase in travel demand. The result has been a turn to private vehicles, an increase in fossil fuel consumption, and a subsequent rise in greenhouse gas emissions and pollution levels. This has also led to congestion, making it increasingly difficult for goods and people to move from place to place, as well as an increasing incidence of road crashes. The net effect is a decrease in the health and well-being of urban dwellers as well as the economic efficiency of the cities that they live in. It is essential that the growing needs of urban mobility be met more efficiently. There is an urgent need for planning for urban mobility that not only provides the required capacity to meet growing demand but does so in a manner that minimizes the energy used. Mitigation efforts in most cities have addressed the symptoms rather than the underlying causes. Cities have tried to deal with congestion by widening their roads or building mass transit systems, without first looking at whether the city needs additional road/mass transit capacity or whether it needs other interventions like improved intersection design or improved road maintenance.\u00a0 \u66f4\u5c11\u663e\u793a, 14909=Gender equality and social inclusion are important contributions to fully realize the development impacts of energy programs. The recently released World Bank (WB) energy directions paper clearly supports that the WBG will work to empower women as users of energy, as well as enabling women to become providers of energy services or make productive use of energy for income generation. ...\u00a0\u66f4\u591a\u663e\u793a Following the release of the World Development report 2012 which emphasized that greater gender equality can enhance productivity, make institutions more representatives, and improve development outcomes for the next generation, the WB made gender mainstreaming a corporate priority. Developed in 2009-10, the Africa renewable energy access (AFREA) gender and energy program piloted different approaches, developed the know-how, and worked with energy teams and government clients on integrating gender into existing and new energy access operations. The program\u0092s objective was to develop and mainstream the application of good practices in applying a gender sensitive approach to energy access policies and projects. The program entailed operational support in integrating gender considerations into WBGs Africa energy projects in Senegal, Mali, Benin, Tanzania, Kenya, and Zambia, and preparatory work in Liberia and Mozambique. As the AFREA I program came to a close in FY2014, a second phase of this program started and the gender and energy capacity building and knowledge exchange workshop was held in Dakar, Senegal, from April 7 to 9th 2014 as a forum for country counterparts to document the lessons and approaches on integrating gender issues into their energy programs under AFREA 1, and to begin planning activities under AFREA 2. The overall objective of the AFREA 2 gender and energy program is to increase adoption of gender sensitive approaches across energy projects in the Africa, through technical support, building internal capacity for gender mainstreaming in energy operations, knowledge development, and improved monitoring and evaluation. In this context, the report presents introduction; proceedings; and conclusion.\u00a0 \u66f4\u5c11\u663e\u793a, 4803=The Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) is a global knowledge and technical assistance program administered by the World Bank.

It draws on experience gained in implementing the previous business plan, consultations with the Consultative Group of donors, advice from the Technical Advisory Group, conclusions and recommendations of the external evaluation of ESMAP conducted in 2011-2012, and lessons learned from the annual ESMAP portfolio review, business plan. ESMAPs business plan is based on the following principles: 1) help shape the future; 2) measure results and demonstrate impacts; 3) provide value for money; 4) ensure relevance to the Banks country sector dialogue and lending operations; 5) work across sectors; 6) scaling-up to respond to increased client demand; 7) increase support to low-income countries, while maintaining engagement with middle-income countries; and 8) strengthen cooperation with other multilateral and bilateral development agencies.\u00a0 \u66f4\u5c11\u663e\u793a, 9253=The Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) is a global knowledge and technical assistance program administered by the World Bank.

In FY2013 alone, twenty-four ESMAP activities directly informed WBG lending or the development of client policies or strategies. ESMAP has started collaborating with the World Banks transport and water operational units to develop activities that relate to energy efficiency in transport and water systems. Focus has been increased on gender and social inclusion, which looks beyond household energy and access issues to incorporate gender considerations into a wide range of energy sector programs. ESMAP has also improved its monitoring and evaluation systems in response to stakeholder feedback. A comprehensive online system has been developed to monitor the results of ESMAP activities.\u00a0 \u66f4\u5c11\u663e\u793a, 35961=The worlds urban population is expected to increase by about 2.7 billion by 2050. Virtually all of the increased population will be in developing countries, leading to massive needs for new and improved housing and urban infrastructures (UNDESA 2012). ...\u00a0\u66f4\u591a\u663e\u793a The planning and design of these new developments will reshape or create new urban landscapes with significant implications for energy consumption, infrastructure costs, as well as the livability and social and economic resilience of cities. Studies of cities around the world indicate that a citys livability and its level of energy use are closely linked to its physical form, namely the spatial distribution and dimensions of buildings, streets, and parks, as well as the spatial coordination of residences, jobs, social services, and environmental amenities.\u00a0 \u66f4\u5c11\u663e\u793a, 26616=This report investigates whether, and how, results-based aid (RBA) could be used to support the implementation of the National Program for Improved Household Biomass Cook Stoves Development and Promotion in Ethiopia. ...\u00a0\u66f4\u591a\u663e\u793a The report is intended to assist Energy in its discussions with the Government of Ethiopia regarding how results-based approaches could be used to structure the financial support that it is providing to Ethiopia to promote energy access and emissions reductions. It also serves to illustrate the methodological discussion regarding RBA outlined in an accompanying paper by Vivid Economics. The National Program for Improved Household Biomass Cook Stoves Development and Promotion is an ambitious program for the deployment of more than 9 million improved cook stoves (ICS) in Ethiopia by January 2018. This deployment is expected to lead to a range of benefits including a reduction in emissions of up to 14 Mt of CO2e over three years, a reduction of 1,000 to 2,000 deaths per year from indoor air pollution and the creation of more than 5,000 private sector jobs. The value of these benefits is expected to be significantly greater than the resources that the Ethiopian government estimates it needs from international development partners to deliver the program. The objective of the cook stove scheme seems to be to (i) improve the health and wellbeing of households through increased access to clean energy and (ii) to prevent deforestation and forest degradation. The report also provides discussion about some of the more detailed design characteristics for each the approaches to (RBA).\u00a0 \u66f4\u5c11\u663e\u793a, 2512=The Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) is a global knowledge and technical assistance program administered by the World Bank.

Fossil fuel subsidies are putting strains on government budgets and undermining a level playing field for renewable energy options. Utilities struggle with poor governance and a lack of cost-reflective tariffs. Poor reliability and quality of energy supply hampers economic growth and competitiveness for many developing countries. Over the past four fiscal years alone (FY2009-12), ESMAP has contributed to the identification and design of approved World Bank Group (WBG) lending of US$ 14 billion. These lending operations in turn leveraged a further US$ 13.2 billion in funding from public, private, and other international sources. The energy assessments and strategies program continues to play an important role in ESMAP\u0092s engagement with country clients, supporting analytical and advisory work on energy sector planning, policies, and institutions. Moving into FY2013 and beyond, the program will complement country-level assessments with global analytical and advisory activities, including work on private sector participation in power grids, social impacts of energy policy reform, and electricity planning at times of risk, as well as on country-level deployment of the Model for Electricity Technology Assessment (META) tool.\u00a0 \u66f4\u5c11\u663e\u793a}",
