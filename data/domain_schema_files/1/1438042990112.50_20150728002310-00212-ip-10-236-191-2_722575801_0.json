            "Probability and Statistics for Systems Engineering This course is designed for students with a background in engineering, technology, or science that have not taken a class in statistics or need a refresher class. In this class we will apply probability and statistics throughout a system\u2019s life cycle. Topics include the roles of probability and statistics in Systems Engineering, the nature of uncertainty, axioms and properties of probability models and statistics, hypothesis testing, design of experiments, basic performance requirements, quality assurance specification, functional decomposition, technical performance measurements, statistical verification, and simulation.",
            "Introduction to Systems Engineering The growing complexity of today\u2019s engineered systems presents daunting challenges to those who are charged with creating, operating, enhancing and sustaining them throughout their lifecycles. While the components of these systems require no less design effort than in the past, attention to the components is not sufficient to ensure overall system success. This course focuses on the interactions between the elements of a complex system, the context within which they are designed and operate, and the relationships between the technical systems and the organizations that design them and the enterprises that they serve. Students develop the understanding of techniques and processes that can help them ensure that their individual contributions are not only excellent in themselves, but that they become part of a cohesive, successful whole. This course may not be applied toward a Master\u2019s of Engineering in Systems Engineering or Engineering Management.",
