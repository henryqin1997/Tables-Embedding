The \u201chave and have-not\u201d America that King decried still exists today, he said. \u00a0 \u201cToday if Dr. King were alive, I venture to say he would be very disappointed in us,\u201d Haynes said. \u201cThe civil rights movement had a lot of good white people, a lot of good black people ... who talked about how we should all get along and work together.\u201d \u00a0 Haynes listed three major obstacles standing in the way of the future King envisioned - the lack of effective early childhood education, gun violence and low expectations and achievements of black males. The solution to all three problems is to raise expectations, he said. \u00a0 \u201cA rising tide certainly raises all boats,\u201d he said. \u00a0 PRCC student Melissa Stewart encouraged the audience to actively work against prejudice of all kinds. \u00a0 \u201cThe walls of prejudice are still being built,\u201d she said. Stewart described herself as a gay white woman and recovering drug addict. \u00a0 \u201cIf you strip me down, I am nothing more than a human being,\u201d she said. Labels are the materials used to build the walls of prejudice, she said. \u00a0 \u201cIt would be a great injustice not to continue to knock down the walls of prejudice wherever we find them,\u201d she said. \u00a0 The program also include a performance by The Voices, PRCC\u2019s a capella ensemble. \u00a0 The observance was sponsored by the PRCC History and Humanities Club., 17546=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2013 by Pearl River Community College.
