    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{7063=\u00a0Though Nightwing was released in 7785 Arkham Asylum this version of him is quite different. The biggest difference is red on black colour-scheme, which replaces the blue on black from 2006 and is used to show his special emblem which is also slightly different than the 2006 version which was a flatter V-shape and didn't go up in the middle. His messy black hair sits atop a double sided face which has one side grinning confidently with the other being an angry scowl, both are adorned with a black domino mask with red eye-slits. The front and back of his torso has the muscular printing that's common to the super heroes theme overlaid with the V-shaped Nightwing symbol and his legs a standard black., 5185=First we have the titular Man-bat who is only figure in this set to be all-new since a blue Nightwing figure was featured in the 2006 set 7785 Arkham Asylum \u00a0under the\u00a0Batman theme. The inclusion of Man-bat in a bit surprising, but not unwelcome, given that he's a relatively obscure character in fact there are quite a few more popular characters that lego could have used instead that wouldn't have required any new moulds such as Killer Croc (who at this point is the only figure from the original Batman theme to no be redone for the DC subtheme)\u00a0Black Mask or Katana. An even better choice than those three would have been Deathstroke who in retrospect would have been great opposite Nightwing since the former is primarily the enemy of the Teen Titans, a team which latter used to be on when he went under the alias Robin, but I digress. Man-bat is quite well done utilizing brown versions of the new hair/ear and the winged minifigure arm pieces, introduced in the Monster Fighters theme. His head, like the two other figures in this set, is double sided one face depicting a fierce sort of smile and the other a fearful expression. His front torso printing depicts a muscular chest with some light-nougat coloured fur covering most of the upper middle and his back similarly shows his back muscles with some additional light-nougat fur around the back of the neck. His pants are standard blue which is fine though it would have been nice to have some printing showing tears in his pant-legs or something., 8089=Batman is in his standard DC subtheme printing (this time in black) with muscular armour overlaid with a yellow bat-emblem and utility belt which continues around to the back. His face has the usual Batman expressions (neutral and angry) and his legs are plain black but his cowl is the semi-new remodel introduced in 2013.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "\u00a0 We can get a good understanding of the potential for the set as a whole (MISB) by taking a look at the Brickset ratings and Bricklink prices of other sets of the same price point in the Super Heroes theme.\u00a0 Score: 9 GROWTH POTENTIAL | \u00a0 \u00a0 The box is a standard type for such a set showing some features on the back. Score: 7 PACKAGING | \u00a0 \u00a0 This set is at the normal availability level. Score: 7 EXCLUSIVITY | Super Heroes is one of the most popular themes currently available and is no doubt aided by the recent and ongoing movies and cartoons. The design of the characters in this set are, like all figures not appearing in any movies, based off their appearances in the DC New 52 comics. Score: 9 THEME POPULARITY | Now combining the averages of the sold listings (and substituting Nightwing's Canadian sold average with the for sale average) we get CA $17.53, US $19.90, GBP 15.06 with the averages coming up a little short of the MSRP of the set in its entirety. So while not a superb return for your money if you plan on parting this set out you still get quite a bit back and of course it's always a",
    "textAfterTable": "\u00a0The sets sitting higher on the graph, along with being rated best, generally have more exclusive figures, with the two highest sets have all exclusive figures. Now even though 76011: Batman: Man-bat Attack\u00a0only has two exclusive figures out of three one of those figures is of a very popular character (Nightwing) and the other is semi-popular (Man-bat) much like figures in\u00a076004: Spider-man Spider-Cycle Chase\u00a0of course refering to Venom and Nick Fury respectively. Therefore it's reasonable to assume that\u00a076011: Batman: Man-bat Attack\u00a0will\u00a0perform similarily well. DISPLAY QUALITY | Score: 8 In terms of display and visual appeal this set (aside from the figures) is pretty good with the bat-copter having a nice sleek look to it but the glider is a bit odd looking without a pilot. The completed model makes for a nice display piece especially alongside the other bat-vehicles. CONCLUSION & FINAL ANALYSIS | Score: 8 Though the build is average with a few nice pieces it's the figures and theme popularity that really make this set stand out as a promising investment especially when considering the popularity of Nightwing among Batman fans. \u00a0Considering the Nightwing and Man-bat\u00a0figures are likely to remain exclusive to this set for awhile (possibley permenantly) and Nightwing has a particularily good pontential for growth this set looks well set to become an investment winner once it reaches EOL.\u00a0",
