I am concerned that if the publication standards remain merely guidance councils will be free to ignore them, and without the guidence potential benefits of the government's aspirations will not be realised., 71209=If the argument is \"oh its confusing for english readers\" well why aren't you stipulating a \"12 Dec 2010\" format?, 59876=Extract from joint LGA / CLG press release 4th June 2010, endorsed by Eric Pickles. This press release makes no mention of the \"reuse of the data in innovative applications, mashups, visualisations and analysis\" as an Over-riding Principle., 80958=Is there actually going to be a \" law requiring councils to publish each item of spending over \u00a3500 from January 2011\"?\u00a0\u00a0, 11071=The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has committed local authorities to publish items of spending over \u00a3500 by January 2011. We recommend that where possible data is provided from 1 April 2010. This will add value to the user and demonstrate commitment to complete transparency., 55201=No one can argue with transparency on how the publics hard earned taxes are spent, but we don't need to be lectured by faceless officials on what format to use. For the record my Council has already published the required information since April 2010. It appears to me that CSV is the preferred format as it allows it to be manipulated and then used by other outside bodies either for commercial reasons or to allow Central Government to do some nice graphs. This has nothing to do with being accountable to local taxpayers which should be at the heart of it., 5927=The document below (and attached to this blog post) contains draft guidance for Local Authorities on how to comply with the Prime Minister\u2019s call to publish each financial transaction over \u00a3500 from January 2011. As the guidance is in draft format, we would welcome any comments, suggestions or questions you may have. You can either post your comments below or contact the Local Data Panel directly. We look forward to hearing your feedback to the draft guidance., 100388=See also the Local Government Group \"practitioners' guide\" published\u00a0October 2010, 17395=Councils have also been told they are expected to start publishing new contract and procurement information from Jan 2011, and so all information linking procurement and accounts systems should be published, allowing spending to be linked to contracts and tenders. Procurement systems will also typically have much more information about suppliers (e.g. Company Number) than accounts systems and this will make it much easier for users of the data to identify them.}",

The recommendation therefore is that local authorities where possible should publish whichever classification they can (subject to BVACOP being published under a licence compatible with the It is worth noting that these provide different classifications \u2013 BVACOP is an accounts classification, and Proclass procurement classification. It\u2019s also important to say that while Proclass is published under an open licence, at time of writing BVACOP is not, and is therefore not suitable for use when publishing open data, although there has been talk that this will change. In order for spending to be comparable between periods and between local authorities it is important that it is clearly and consistently categorized. Depending on the accounts system this may be easy or quite difficult. There are two candidates for categorization \u2013 CIPFA\u2019s BVACOP classification and the Proclass procurement classification system (which is widely used in local authority procurement systems). Service categorization This is the part of the entity that has spent the money. It should represent a meaningful part of your organisation structure or activity.
