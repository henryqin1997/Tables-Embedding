    "textAfterTable": "\u00a0 With a downright minuscule 20% drop, \u2018Gravity\u2019 made $44 million in its second weekend for an astonishing $123 million gross. Sure, other movies have opened bigger and have had bigger second weekends, but percentage drops that small are extremely rare. This proves that the film isn\u2019t just a major moneymaker, but a movie that audiences actually love and are talking about. This is the kind of second weekend that comes around when everyone who saw the film told all of their friends to check it out for themselves. Sure, the extra 3D charge doesn\u2019t hurt, but people seem to really like the 3D in \u2018Gravity,\u2019 so all is well for everyone. Although \u2018Gravity\u2019 held onto the top, Paul Greengrass\u2019 \u2018Captain Phillips\u2018 opened very well in second place, grossing $26 million. You can thank the star power of Tom Hanks and the exceptional trailers for that one. We can\u2019t imagine the film being a smash hit in the long run thanks to its difficult, adult subject matter, but it was made for a moderate budget. Unless it has a total drop-off next week, it should be a strong (if not spectacular) success. In many ways, it should play to the \u2018Argo\u2019 crowd. It\u2019s a movie for adults and should continue playing well to them. However, it\u2019s tough to find nice things to say about \u2018Machete Kills,\u2019 which was slaughtered by the critics and completely rejected by audiences. That $3 million opening should hopefully give director",
