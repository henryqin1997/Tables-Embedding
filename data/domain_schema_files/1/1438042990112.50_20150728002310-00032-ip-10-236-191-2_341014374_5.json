This year's course has been great fun to put together. The course is one 80 km loop for the full RAID, and one 40 km loop for the petite raid. It is over 70% single track and the rest is rolling gravel roads. Fall colours will be in full swing and the route offers some awesome vistas. Water crossing from past courses have been taken out as the salmon are running. Last year's winner, Provincial Champion Mike Garrigan, is hoping to break the 4 hours mark this year.
