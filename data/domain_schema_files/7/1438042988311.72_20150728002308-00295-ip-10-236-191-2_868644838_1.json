    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{9242=Metallic silhouette is descended from an old Mexican sport, dating back to the early 1900s, where live game animals were staked out at varying distances as targets. By 1948, metal cutouts of the animals were used instead of live animals, and the first metallic silhouette match was held in Mexico City. Because of its Mexican roots, in America the silhouettes are often referred to by their Spanish names, Gallina (chicken), Javali (pig), Guajalote (turkey), and Borrego (ram).[2], 8178=The International Metallic Silhouette Shooting Union (IMSSU) is the international federation controlling Metallic Silhouette for both rifle and pistol competitions. There are also two major USA-based bodies; the National Rifle Association covers all types of silhouette shooting in the United States, and the USA-based International Handgun Metallic Silhouette Association (IHMSA), founded in 1976.[3] There are some minor differences between the international federations IMSSU rules and those of the NRA and IHMSA, but it is generally possible to compete in all with the same equipment.[2]}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Ranges may be measured in yards or meters, but all targets in a match must be set using the same unit of measure, and the shooters must be informed of the unit used. The exception is the new IHMSA Air Pistol discipline, which is in yards only. Targets for large bore use are 1/2\" to 3/8\" thick steel; small bore targets are 3/16\" to 1/4\" steel, and airgun targets are 1/8\" steel, although some aluminum targets are produced. To allow shooting at ranges which may not have space for a full target layout, NRA rules allow the use of reduced scale pigs, turkeys and rams placed at the same distance as chickens. The scale will be reduced proportional to the change in distance, so the targets will cover the same angular distance as they would if set up at full range. Reduced scale matches fired at paper targets are also popular for informal competitions, especially for Internet based matches where the shooters may reside in different countries. These are generally fired with rimfires or airguns. 27\u00a0in (69\u00a0cm) 23\u00a0in (58\u00a0cm) 14\u00a0in (36\u00a0cm) 11\u00a0in (28\u00a0cm) Height 32\u00a0in (81\u00a0cm) 19\u00a0in (48\u00a0cm) 22\u00a0in (56\u00a0cm) 13\u00a0in (33\u00a0cm) Width Ram Turkey Pig Chicken Silhouette sizes All rifle shooting is done standing, with the firearm unsupported.
