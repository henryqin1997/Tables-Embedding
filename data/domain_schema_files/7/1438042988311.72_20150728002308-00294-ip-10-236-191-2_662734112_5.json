Our prices and inventory change constantly. We calculate the percentage of non-stop/1-stop flights, time between flights, and typical departure times by looking at the most recent winning bids for each route. Every day, we look at a sample of winning bids placed by customers using priceline's exclusive Name Your Own Price\u00ae option. We identify each winning bid's savings over retail by comparing the bid to the price of a comparable retail ticket. We then look at the collection of recent winning bids and calculate the typical savings for the route as a whole.
