            "Students will learn how to use oxy-acetylene cutting, heating, and metal inert gas (MIG) welding on automotive sheet metal. Students will become familiar with how the MIG welding process are used, requirements for metal joining processes and their application to auto collision repair.",
            "Many repairs made to vehicle doors and other glass installations require the removal and installation of glass. Proper removal and installation is necessary to prevent damage to the glass or vehicle. Improper removal and installation can also cause wind noise and water leaks. Selection of proper tools, safe use of tools and proper removal procedures will be emphasized in this course. Installation procedures will be covered.",
            "This course will cover metal straightening, the purpose of plastic fillers and how to use them for their intended purpose in autobody repair.",
            "Proper use and selection of tools is very important to properly remove, install and align bolt-on-panels. Properly removing, installing and aligning bolt-on-parts is essential to restoring the vehicle to pre-accident condition. Proper tools and equipment along with proper techniques are essential for the removal and replacement of weld-on-panels. The fit and finish of the final repair is determined by proper panel installation. Alignment to adjacent panels, gaps at door and decklid, panel warpage and damage to adjacent panels are major factors in the quality of the finished product.",
            "Proper finish of plastic body filler in a quick, efficient manner is necessary to minimize labor costs and maximize earnings. At the completion of this course the student will be able to repair a heavily damaged panel in the most cost effective manner.",
            "Today`s vehicles have finishes that are very refined and free from noticeable defects. To maintain and restore these features in a finish, the technician will learn to identify types of finish defects and the proper correction procedures using the least aggressive methods. This course will cover the characteristics of hazardous wastes and its safe handling, storage, and disposal.",
            "This course is designed to teach the technician specific skills needed to enter the field of reconditioning on new and used cars. It includes buffing and polishing the exteriors, cleaning and detailing the interior, cleaning and painting the engine compartment and installing body accent stripes and moldings. This course will cover the characteristics of hazardous wastes and its safe handling, storage, and disposal.",
            "Following internship guidelines and guidelines in all previous successfully completed courses, the technician will work in a designated auto body repair facility with a journeyman and paint vehicles to manufacturers specifications.",
            "The student will develop a plan for refinishing a vehicle using the correct operation of equipment and paint. Concerns for environmental health and safety will be followed and enforced. This course will cover the characteristics of hazardous wastes and its safe handling, storage, and disposal.",
            "This course will enable the technician to identify type and color of a finish. The student will understand undercoat materials, sanding procedures and masking procedures in the preparation of the surface for refinishing. Manufacturers of today`s vehicles use various refinish systems such as single stage, base coat, clearcoat and tri-stage. To properly refinish a vehicle and meet customer expectations, the technician will understand and apply these types of finishes. This course will cover the characteristics of hazardous wastes and its safe handling, storage, and disposal."
