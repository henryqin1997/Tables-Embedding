The 269 deaths from 29 accidents in 2013 were well below the 10-year average of 719 deaths and 32 accidents, according to the Aviation Safety Network. The airline safety and product rating site analyzed a number of factors related to audits from aviation\u2019s governing bodies and organizations, government audits and airline fatality records. All of the top 10 airlines received seven stars \u2013\u00a0 the most an airline can earn \u2014 for safety and in-flight products. However, 137 of the 448 airlines tracked by AirlineRatings.com earned seven stars. Nearly 50 had three stars or less. The other nine airlines are (in alphabetical order): Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Eva Air, Royal Jordanian, Singapore Airlines and Virgin Atlantic. That\u2019s the result of AirlineRatings.com\u2019s list of 2013\u2032s top 10 safest airlines issued this week. None of the top 10 are a U.S.-based carrier.
