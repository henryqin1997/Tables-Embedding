FIP is an ERA-like stat that looks only at those things a pitcher most controls, home runs, walks and strikeouts. fWAR is Fangraphs' model of Wins Above Replacement. rWAR is Baseball Reference's model of Wins Above Replacement. VORP is Baseball Prospectus' valuation system. SNW is support-neutral wins, Baseball Prospectus' estimate of how many wins a pitcher \"should\" have, given an average team. You can't blame a voter for putting any of these guys (except Cahill, really) on a ballot, depending on what metric they value. But it's a shame Weaver will be overlooked. Weaver has been a top-three pitcher this year. Unfortunately, he hasn't been a top-3 \"inspiring his teammates to score runs while he's sitting on the bench\" pitcher this year. Blame the Angels' offense when Weaver doesn't finish in the top 3 in Cy Young voting this year. Most Popular Update:",
