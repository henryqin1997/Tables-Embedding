Normality of variables was assessed according to Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For the comparison of non-normal distributed values, the non-parametric two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test, the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U-test were used. p values \u2264 0.05 were considered statistically significant., 45957=Total RNA was isolated from tissue samples using Tripure Isolation Reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and treated with DNase I (Fermentas, Hanover, MD, USA) to remove any possible residual genomic DNA. The integrity of RNA samples was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis, visualizing two intact ribosomal 18S and 28S RNA bands. Concentration and purity of RNA samples were checked by measuring the absorbance A260/A280 ratio in a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). This ratio was between 1.90 and 2.0 for all the samples included in this study., 19547=Int. J. Mol.
