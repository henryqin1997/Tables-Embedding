Showed potential to succeed but did not show full competence in one or more aspects, e.g., law, analysis, organization, judgment, logic, and organization. Likely conclusory., 31742=Students choosing to type exams on a personal laptop computer may do so using ExamSoft secure software which can be downloaded from and registered at www.examsoft.com/jfklaw.\u00a0 The registration period for ExamSoft begins at the start of the fall semester and closes approximately two (2) weeks before the start of the December exam period and again approximately two (2) weeks before the start of the May exam period. Registrations are effective through the academic year and expire at the end of August.\u00a0, 655=The National University System was established in 2001 to meet the emerging challenges and demands of education in the 21st century. The System is uniquely aligned to connect a diverse population of students to a network of innovative educational programs that are relevant to their lives, careers, and the marketplace and are delivered in a format that respects competing life priorities., 29177=60 Extremely weak answer. May have spotted some issues but missed obvious ones. Unclear and confused response. May have misstated or misapplied legal doctrine or rules.

May have spotted some issues and given some rules or doctrine but showed inability to analyze and to weave law and facts. Probably misstated law or applied the wrong rule. Little or no redeeming quality to the answer. Errors in judgment. 50 is a completely unacceptable level of performance showing lack of potential to succeed., 27606=80-89 Very good. All major issues and minor issues were spotted. All important rules and analyses were clear and correct. Some analyses may not be as deep as an \"A\" answer. May not have shown subtle distinctions in facts or rules. Clear and coherent presentation. Very clearly showed command of subject matter and high level of analytical skill., 29913=Mandatory Grading Curve The following is the mandatory grading scale that was instituted at JFK University College of Law in July 1999 to ensure that grades are not inflated and that they accurately reflect a student's performance.\u00a0 This curve is based on the standards and norms in legal education and in screening applicants for admission to the Bar. This curve applies to graded courses only., 28914=65 Weak answer. Understood some issues and some rules, but did not spot all key issues or apply the law in an analytical or organized fashion. Confused or incomplete response. Conclusory. May have applied law to facts incorrectly., 28074=75\u00a0 Clearly passing. Demonstrated solid knowledge of subject matter and ability to apply it. May have missed minor issues or glossed over aspects of the analysis. Not as uniformly strong as an \"A\" or a \"B.\" Satisfactory without being a truly strong answer. May have shown some conclusory application of law to facts. Nonetheless, the answer would have satisfactorily passed as a Bar Exam answer., 36219=Pleasant Hill Law Library\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 925.969.3120 Berkeley Law Library\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0510.647.2066}",
