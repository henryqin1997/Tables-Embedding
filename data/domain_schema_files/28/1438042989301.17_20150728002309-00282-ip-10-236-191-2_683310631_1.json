I don\u2019t think it was ever anything serious and nothing since then., 100359=\u201cSo why would Rugby Union people come over to our game in their droves where there\u2019s no money to be gained at all\u201d Well in 2008 when South Africa toured through England I spoke with some of the players and basically they we bored of Union and unless you had conatct within the SARU it hard to get into the top flight and get paid. Basically under the S15 teams and Currie cup, Union doesnt pay either and so there is not difference for them playing Union or league.}",
