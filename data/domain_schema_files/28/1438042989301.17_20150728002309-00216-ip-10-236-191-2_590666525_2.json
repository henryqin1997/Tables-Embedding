    "textAfterTable": "Last update 2 August 17:59 The climate in United States The climate in the US is extremely varied. From a polar climate in Alaska to a subtropical climate in Florida. The south is notorious for its hurricanes between July and November which can cause a lot of devastation, and the north-east is famous for its winter blizzards. Central USA has a continental climate where summer is very warm (30-35 \u00b0C) and winter when the mercury regularly drops below freezing. Most precipitation falls in the summer months. The Western and South-Eastern Seaboards are the wettest regions of the country. On the west coast the differences between winter and summer are less than on the east coast. It doesn\u2019t freeze much in the west, especially when you head south. The North-Eastern Seaboard, with many large cities, sees surprisingly large temperature variations with 28 \u00b0C in summer and freezing in winter. This is due to the fact that the wind usually blows offshore. Climate data for Salt Lake City Temperature Rainfall Sun Humidity",
