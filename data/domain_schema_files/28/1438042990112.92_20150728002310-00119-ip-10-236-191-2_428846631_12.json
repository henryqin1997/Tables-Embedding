Tidal waves ranging from just over one to about four metres inundated many islands. 83 people were confirmed dead and another 25 missing and feared dead and more than 1 300 were injured. Thirty-nine islands were damaged and nearly a third of the population or 100 000 people were affected. Fourteen islands were completely destroyed and had to be evacuated. Approximately 12 000 people were displaced from their islands, and another 8500 temporarily relocated within their home island; thus 7 percent of the population was displaced. The force of the waves caused widespread infrastructure devastation in the tolls. Flooding wiped out electricity on many islands, also destroying vital communication links. Water supply was disrupted in about 15 percent of the islands and 25 percent had major damage to the essential infrastructure such as jetties and harbours., 353491=Figure 17.3. Monitoring of exchangeable Na+ from permanent monitoring sites established at a) Cot Lheu Rheng, Pidie; b) Panteraja, Pidie; c) Lhok Nga, Aceh Besar; and d) Pineuna, Aceh Besar over the period September 2005 and December 2005., 69687=1073, 85461=1260, 225919=1279, 62899=The long-term R3MAS rehabilitation programme set to go beyond 2009, will focus on the rehabilitation of heavily affected paddy fields with an emphasis on the rebuilding of new paddy fields; the establishment of new farms to produce coconut and palm oil; the development of workshops for the servicing of agricultural machinery; the rebuilding the market facilities for livestock; redevelopment of farmers organization and extension workers; redevelopment of the agricultural education and training; development of the new suitable technologies appropriate for agro-industries; the development of market oriented activities through the establishment of agribusiness terminals; and establishing of business partners., 105970=FAO ERCU Maldives opened its office on March 1 and local support staff was recruited in early March. A two-week AFFC mission provided invaluable assistance in setting up the financial management system and training in the related FAO procedures. A 3-day ITO mission from the Regional Office assisted with advice on interconnection arrangements, installing the ICT system, provision of hands-on training and selection of a local IT support service provider. By mid-April the office was fully operational and able to communicate with the rest of the FAO system., 12785=Immediate steps taken in meeting the short-term plan for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are described in Table 1.3. In the Nicobar district 5 000 m of protective dykes were constructed to prevent seawater intrusion to rice fields. Debris was cleared from 1 600 ha This included the clearing of debris from affected agricultural land, the scraping of surface deposits of salt and the application of organic manures and gypsum to salt-affected lands. In addition, equipment and implements were provided to affected farmers to assist in the establishment of agronomic, horticultural and plantation crops. Progress as of the 31 March 2006 in achieving the short-term goals are presented in Table 1.3., 103906=FAO responded swiftly and decisively to the crisis by immediately mounting a mission, coordinated by the Representation in Colombo, to assist MFAMR (Ministry of Fisheries, Agriculture and Marine Resources) in the initial agricultural and fisheries damage assessment surveys thereby establishing a basis for determining the requirements for immediate support. Prior to the tsunami, FAO was not physically present in the Maldives. This changed with the deployment an FAOR a.i. (subsequently designated Officer-in-Charge) who arrived in the country on January 29, 2005. An Operations and Programme Officer (OPO) was out-posted on February 5., 144959=Without the intervention of government, international organizations and NGOs, it would have been very difficult to rehabilitate the livelihoods of affected communities. As part of the rehabilitation effort project (MYA/05/001) that addressed fishing communities, fisher-farmers and homestead gardeners was launched and implemented in accordance with the Letter of Agreement that was signed by FAO with UNDP on 13 April 2005. The project was started on 13 March 2005 and completed at 30 April 2006. The major contributor was the Government of Japan. Total budget used in the project was US$804 000., 109587=The services of an FAO Volunteer were available from 3 May to 5 December 2005. An Information/ Reporting Assistant was recruited over the period 20 November 2005 to 20 May 2006., 65432=Given the scale of the disaster, and the need to restore normality to the lives of coastal communities and internally displaced persons (IDPs) as soon as possible, the Ministry of Agriculture and Development (MoA) and the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) of the Republic of Indonesia officially requested emergency assistance from the international community on 30 December 2004., 217092=1315, 16945=Provisions of farm implements equipment (1000 power tillers), 325099=The Green Belt concept has emerged with the association of many state and other agencies after the Government declared zoning in the coastal zone; 100 m on the west coast and 200 m on the east coast based on the extent of the damage. After much discussion, limits have now been revised and are in line with those declared in the Revised Coastal Zone Management Plan of 1997. These limits vary with the particular site and are based on the coastal bathymetry and other factors of vulnerability., 29030=The Government of Tamil Nadu provided a package under the Rehabilitation of Tsunami Affected Agricultural Lands (ROTAAL). Through this, the government announced compensation packages for crop and livestock loss. Tamil Nadu Government implemented a package of Rs.12500/ha for land reclamation for 3 years initially, which was increased to Rs.15 000/per ha subsequently . This includes soil testing, removal of salt, land leveling, gypsum application, green manures, sowing of seeds, ploughing and cultivation, subsistence allowance every season in the second and third years, and insurance premium for two years., 260177=The level of damage to agricultural land was evaluated and classified into 3 categories. The area of low, medium and high damage were 918.4 (8.7 percent), 8800.7 (83.6 percent) and 807.5 (7.7 percent) rai, respectively. The most highly damaged crops were coconut, consisting of a total of 5245.0 rai, of which 88.4 percent was located in Phang-Nga province. The total damage to cashew nut plantings was 2676.8 rai, and about 2245.6 rai or 84 percent was in Ranong province. The damaged area of paddy was 1104.0 rai and most of it (87.5 percent) was at a medium level of damage. About 65.3 percent of the damage area was in Ranong province (Table 13.4)., 295370=LWR/2005/004 Management of soil fertility for restoring cropping in tsunami affected soils areas of Aceh (6/05-5/07, $0.5 m), 334188=Many people owned land along the coast prior to the tsunami. However, after the event, the Government declared that 100 m and 200 m from the high water line on the west coast and east coast respectively should be declared a no build zone. With time it was reduced and finally it is adhering to the setback levels declared in the 1997 Coastal Zone Management Plan. A setback area is a geographical strip or band within the coastal zone or within which certain development activities are prohibited or significantly restricted. It comprises of the Reservation Area and the Restricted Area lying between the Seaward Reference Line and the Landward Reference Line. The Reservation Area is nearest to the shoreline, is a no build zone in which only uses that are absolutely essential are allowed. The Restricted Area can be used for low impact activities such as small dwelling units. The width of the Reservation Area and the Restricted Area will vary in accordance with vulnerability to erosion of the coastal segment in which it is located., 234153=The effects of the tsumani in Thailand were confined to coastal communities along the Andaman Sea. A total of 5800 people died with 2900 declared missing. 3600 houses were destroyed and 412 communities were affected. The worst affected province was Phang-Nga where 4225 people lost their lives and 4394 households were affected by the disaster. Within the province 957 ha of agricultural land was lost and 412 farmers were affected. Along with this, livestock were destroyed and natural resources (i.e. mangroves, beaches, corals and fresh water) were all negatively impacted upon., 86952=1984, 357054=5 Ref. 1003/10/3/BRR6MonthInfoSheet, Badan Rehabilitasi dan Rekonstruksi (BRR)., 4776=1750, 81570=The distribution of agricultural kits to beneficiaries was undertaken through NGO partners. In 2005 and early 2006, FAO has signed Letter of Agreements (LoA) with 27 NGOs consisting of 10 local NGOs and 17 international NGOs. NGO partners undertook the selection of beneficiaries according to FAO's criteria, distribution of agricultural inputs in their working area as part of livelihood programme, and monitoring and evaluation during plant growth and harvest. The agricultural inputs were distributed in 742 villages in 8 districts of Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam province (NAD)., 250624=The assessment results showed that the most highly damaged provinces were Phang-Nga, Ranong and Satun with a total agricultural area affected by the tsunami of 6671, 3306 and 1183 rai (1 rai is, 47564=Source: GoTN status report, Feb 06., 41192=Overall, 897 villages across 27 districts in 3 states and 2 Union Territories were affected by the 26 December 2004 tsunami. Farmers and fisher were the main groups affected by the tsunami. More than 600 000 agriculturists and agricultural workers were affected (According to the Tamil Nadu unit of the All India Kisan Sabha)., 123473=The immediate challenge for the ERCU is to successfully complete the approved tsunami-relief activities. These relate in the main to the distribution of remaining procured seedlings and cuttings. In addition it is necessary to design and implement an exit strategy that would facilitate smooth closure of the office. Fortunately, it is already agreed to extend operations to September 2006 to allow completion of project activities. Planning the related operational and financial/administrative management activities to effect the foregoing is already in train., 262260=1911.20, 290775=Key findings from an ACIAR-funded missions in 2006 were:\u00a0, 158863=15:15:15 Compound fertilizer (50 kg bags), 184374=The Government of Sri Lanka, having evaluated the relatively slow progress of recovery, decided that improvements needed to be made in the delivery, progress and quality of the interventions provided by a wide range of service providers, ranging from the national government departments, to international and local development agencies. To this effect the Reconstruction and Development Agency (RADA) was en established in November 2005 by a directive of His Excellency the President through the merging of the Taskforce For Rebuilding the Nation (TAFREN) with other agencies. The mandate of RADA is to carry out reconstruction and development work in districts affected by man-made or natural disasters in a cost effective and expeditious manner., 95510=* 2005 1 US$ = 9 000 IDR, 107212=With the out-posting of the ERC in July, procurement on track and in-country activities taking off, there was a surge in the volume of transactions, with expenditure levels increasing almost ten-fold between the second and fourth quarters of 2005 and into 2006. Changing expenditure patterns, contract administration and the logistics and coordination tasks associated with procurement, delivery and distribution in this multi-island archipelagic state made heavy demands on the oversight, management and implementation capacity of the ERCU., 219433=1620, 51128=On Sunday December 26, 2004, Indonesia was hit by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that developed in the Indian Ocean. The quake triggered a powerful 10 m high tsunami, which affected coastal settlements in Aceh and North Sumatra. The impact of the tsunami was felt in 10 districts in Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam Province and 2 districts in North Sumatra (Nias Islands) (Figure 3.1). It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people were killed and injured and 400000 persons displaced., 13542=Table 1.3. Progress as of 31 March 2006 with respect to meeting the short-term plan objectives for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, 65861=Three projects in agriculture recovery have been completed 1.5 years after the tsunami. Support came from the government of Belgium, Japan and the European Community through the projects OSRO/INS/501/BEL, OSRO/INS/503/JPN, and OSRO/INS/509/EC. One project OSRO/INS/513/ BEL is still going on through time extension until October 2006 with the title \"Support to farmers in tsunami affected areas through the provision of agricultural and livestock inputs\"., 260078=11952, 229496=2315, 84984=1583, 61874=Within the short-term plan (2005-2009) of the R3MAS programme the focus will be on the rehabilitation of the tsunami affected paddy fields that are classified as suffering from light and medium damages; optimization of the land used for dry land food and horticulture commodities; the establishment of new paddy fields; the replanting of green crops and fruit crops in backyards; procurement of facilities and agriculture inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, and machinery; the evaluation of crops variety for tolerance to salinity; capacity building of the rural communities/ farmers/and extension workers; rehabilitation of peoples farms that include coconut, palm oil, coffee, rubber, cacao, and nutmeg; education and farmers training; the development of livestock processing facilities and local disease control; and distribution of livestock (goats, cows, buffalos, and poultry) to farmers. It is estimated that for the completion of the R3MAS short-term programme in 2009 a further US$328.2 million is required., 24848=Farmers and agriculture workers in India and in particular those in the states and territories of Tamil Nadu and Andaman Nicobar Islands were shaken and traumatized by the destruction wreaked by tsunami of December 26, 2004. Crops were destroyed and fields contaminated with saline salts and deposited sediments. India had not experienced such destruction of this kind in the recent years., 55541=The budget for the year 2005-2006 is US$69.4 million. The R3MAS activities for the 2005-2006 that are currently being undertaken include the following:, 342120=Table 17.1. Selected chemical and physical characteristics of deposited sediments of marine origin collected from affected agricultural field in January 2005, 144188=The tsunami of the 26 December 2005 had limited impact and was confined to areas of the Myanmar coastal zone. The most severely affected townships in Myanmar were: Labutta and Ngaputaw Townships in Ayeyarwaddy Division; Kawthaung Township in Tanintharyi Division, and Kyaukphyu Township in Rakhine State. In general, the magnitude of destruction caused by tsunami was not as severe as that experienced in Thailand, Indonesia and Sri Linka. The Pyinsalu sub-township of Labutta Township was the worst affected area with 25 people losing their lives, more than one thousand people left homeless and 289 houses totally destroyed. Four villages, namely Khar Pyat Thaung, Lay Yin Kwin, Kaingthaung and Aung Hlaing in the Pyinsalu sub-township were severely affected., 287068=The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) was established in 1982 and together with AusAID, ACIAR forms part of the Australian Government Aid Programme. The mission of the centre is \"To achieve more productive and sustainable agricultural systems, for the benefit of Developing Countries and Australia, through international agricultural research partnerships\". ACIAR facilitates and funds collaborative research and development and training projects, but does not carry out the projects directly. The total annual budget for the centre is USD $45 million/year with its activities having a strong Asia-Pacific focus., 124662=Discussions will be intensified with MFAMR and other partners on proposed new strategies and interventions for FAO to continue to support medium- and long-term agricultural development. These must be seen within the comprehensive framework of the 7th National Development Plan (2006-2010) and the Agricultural Master Plan (2006-2020), both currently in preparation. Of relevance here too are the possible and required linkages with the shelter programme undertaken by UNDP and the Red Crosses; and initiatives being pursued with ADB, WB and IFAD., 212442=Post-tsunami events in December 2004, the FAO became the lead UN coordinating agency for the fisheries and agricultural sectors in Sri Lanka. The current rehabilitation programme that is being lead is worth US$26.5 million and comprises of 9 projects in the fisheries sector worth US$23.3 million; 4 projects in the agricultural sector worth US$2.5 million; and regional project associated with forestry rehabilitation that has a Sri Lankan component worth US$0.75 million., 287732=The livelihoods of communities in the fisheries and agriculture sectors were the hardest hit as a result of the devastating tsunami in December 2004. The need to re-establish food production and livelihoods remains an urgent priority as initial as food and other aid is withdrawn form affected areas. Many issues require technical inputs or training. In this respect ACIAR's mandate effectively means that it has a greater role to play now rather than in the immediate phase after the event., 54586=The recovery process in Agricultural Sectors undertaken by the Ministry of Agriculture has been termed the R3MAS (Rehabilitation and Reconstruction for the People of Aceh and North Sumatra) which will be executed over a 5 year period (2005-2009). The estimated budget required for this programme amounts to US$397.6 million. The programme consists of 3 main areas of focus:, 63925=On 26 December 2004, Indonesia was severely hit by a powerful earthquake, followed by a series of aftershocks that triggered a tsunami that various coastal communities. The most affected areas in Indonesia were the provinces of Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam (NAD) and Northern Sumatra. In Indonesia alone, more than 131 000 people were killed, another 37 000 classified as missing 5, and over 400 000 survivors lost their homes and livelihoods. According to the initial damage assessments of the agriculture sector carried out by FAO together with Indonesia's Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), it was estimated that about 37 500 ha of wet land and 29 000 ha of dry land agricultural lands were inundated by the tsunami, causing erosion of bunds, salinization of soil, siltation of lands and irrigation and drainage canals. About one-third of the affected land was situated along the north-east coast and two-thirds on the west coast of Aceh. The earthquake damaged irrigation networks and canals rendering irrigation schemes inoperative. A significant amount of livestock in affected areas were lost to the tsunami. Survivors of the disaster found themselves without a means of livelihood and lacking the tools and capital to restart productive activities. Moreover, key infrastructure was destroyed and the Government's local capacity to rebound was severely compromised, as several district and provincial level staff and extension workers lost their lives in the disaster., 297788=LWR/2005/118 Restoration of annual cropping in tsunami affected areas of Aceh province, Indonesia (9/06-8/08, $1 m), 32330=(Source: GoTN status report, Feb 06), 129202=The 26 December 2004 tsunami devastated the agriculture sector of the Maldives. Approximately 50 percent of the cultivated area on inhabited islands was destroyed due to salt water intrusion with economic losses in agricultural sector estimated to be US$6.46 million. Fields of perennial trees such as coconuts, breadfruits, mango, betel leaf, guava, water apple were reportedly uprooted by the waves and (except for coconut) died from salt toxicity. Banana stands being highly susceptible to salt stress were severely damaged. The groundwater aquifer in more than 50 percent of the inhabited islands was seriously affected by salt water intrusion and in the remaining islands the water quality was severely compromised. It is estimated that approximately 58 percent of the farmers and 14172 home gardeners on the islands were impacted upon by the tsunami., 114767=The ERCU briefs and makes arrangements for Ministry delegations attending FAO meetings, including the biennial FAO and Regional Conferences and also serves on one of the consultative committees for the preparation of the 7th National Development Plan 2006-2010. In addition, visiting missions of the IFI\u2019s (WB and ADB), IFAD and UN system and other development agencies call on the Unit for briefings on the agricultural sector and on overall development. There is particular interest in understanding how ongoing relief activities fit or may integrate into a broader rehabilitation and recovery framework and within a medium- to longer-term development framework and strategy., 232876=In addition, the organization was responsible in convening the Rehabilitation Programme Workshop in Colombo on the 23rd-24th March 2006, where a large number of actors discussed and assessed activities currently being undertaken., 66964=For the first phase of its overall agricultural relief programme, FAO procured 286 tonnes of rice seed, 119 tonnes of secondary crops, 8000 packages of vegetables, 373000 seedlings of estate crops, 2833.5 tonnes of fertilizer, 38000 pieces of tools, 770 hand tractors, 250 threshers, 50 paddy reapers, and 300 water pumps with a total value of US$2782217. Table 4.1 provides details on the procurement for the first phase of the overall agricultural relief programme., 995=The severe earthquake of 26 December 2004 followed by the tsunami struck the Indian coast line causing extensive damage to property, crops and significant loss of life to communities in the island states of Andaman and Nicobar, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala. The greatest degree of damage occurred in Nicobar districts and in Little Andaman of Andaman district. Extensive damage also occurred in the South Andaman Islands and the intensity of the damage gradually declined towards the North Andaman., 48036=In the aftermath of tsunami, Tamil Nadu Organic Farmers Movement (TOFARM), a network of farmer's associations based in Trichy, decided to assist people to reclaim the lands through the use of organic methods. The activities of the organization were successful in the reclamation of more than 1600 hectares of land through the application organic based approaches in 25 Panchayats, desalination of 1024 ponds, de-silting of 19 km of drainage canals and establishment of 3200 vermicomposting pits directly and influencing the reclamation process of agricultural lands in Nagapattinam., 110545=FAO assistance to victims of the tsunami in the agricultural sector will impact approximately 4200 households comprising just about 21000 inhabitants of 50 islands in 13 atolls across the archipelago. An important feature of this intervention is the FAO collaboration with UNDP Maldives in the replacement of lost assets including tools and other inputs., 86471=12978, 229066=1300, 87715=1231, 219248=1430, 106539=The establishment of the ERCU ensured that attention was focused on working more closely with MFAMR counterparts on the urgent task of collating and refining data re: quantities and specifications (including verification of damage assessment surveys). This was a priority for accelerating procurement of needed supplies for the agricultural relief activities. In addition, considerable time was spent (up to April/May 2005) before eventually convincing the authorities that FAO procedures and arrangements should govern the procurement process. As a result, after much delay the outstanding issue of government signing the relevant project documents was resolved., 44405=The worst affected districts within Tamil Nadu were Nagapattinam and Cuddalore and in the Andamans region: South Andaman, Middle Andaman, Little Andaman, Car Nicobar, Great Nicobar and Nancowry group of islands. Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry have a coastal length of 1025 kms. Tsunami water ingress was recorded to occur up to 1-3 km inland from the coast. Average height of tsunami was 7-10 m. The total number of villages affected was 376 and 33 in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry respectively. Largely, soil testing across the region showed that there were no changes in pH but there were considerable differences in the Electric Conductivity (EC)., 82158=Almost 23000 farmers received benefit from the distributed rice seed. However, only 50 and 69 percent of the rice seed was cultivated by the farmers in the east and west coast, respectively, due to the lateness in distribution. In total more than 10000 ha of rice fields have been re-cultivated and harvested and only 36 percent of the rehabilitated area in west coast. Table 4.2 provides a breakdown of the distributed rice seed. The rice seed was used in the first planting season after the tsunami as the traditional planting season of May/June and September/October were was changed., 317715=Sumatra - Tsunami, the Killer Wave swept over nearly two thirds of the coast of Sri Lanka on 26 December 2004. In total more than 250000 people died in Asia, with Sri Lanka contributing an estimated 40000 to this total. Around 500000 people in Sri Lanka were displaced and more than 119000 houses destroyed or damaged., 117228=Prior to the tsunami, UNDP, UNICEF, WHO and UNFPA were the only external development agencies represented in the Maldives. The period immediately after December 26, 2004 witnessed an explosion in the numbers of such organizations in the country. This has severely stretched the limited human resources in public sector agencies in terms of their capacity for coordination and implementation. What may have been a manageable problem before the tsunami has turned into a crisis following the influx of significant financial resources and the multiplicity of external partners and activities within a constrained time period., 101438=Economic loss was estimated at 62 percent of GDP; the latter recording a 5 percent decline in 2005. Employment was adversely affected by low hotel occupancy rates and loss of assets in the fisheries, agricultural and other productive sectors. Livelihoods needed to be restored. The relief and reconstruction effort encountered constraints of insufficient and untimely financing, inadequate human resource capacity (quantity and quality) and high costs and logistical difficulties of internal inter-island transport., 328113=In the coastal zone, there are many deed holders having land very close to the sea. According to the Revised Coastal Zone Management Plan of 1997, reservations are being set and erection of any permanent or temporary buildings are not permitted on them.

List of major agricultural sector programmes proposed along with their associated funding requirements and current status In an effort to rehabilitate the agricultural sector and provide assistance, 8 major programmes were drafted, out of which 3 programmes are currently progressing with the aid of ADB, FAO, UNDP, World Bank, IFAD and JICS support (Table 6.1). One of the programmes was ruled out after the initial assessments. The rest of the programmes are set to begin as funding becomes available. The 26 December 2004 tsunami devastated the agriculture sector of the Maldives. Approximately 50 percent of the cultivated area on inhabited islands was destroyed due to salt water intrusion with economic losses in agricultural sector estimated to be US$6.46 million. Fields of perennial trees such as coconuts, breadfruits, mango, betel leaf, guava, water apple were reportedly uprooted by the waves and (except for coconut) died from salt toxicity. Banana stands being highly susceptible to salt stress were severely damaged. The groundwater aquifer in more than 50 percent of the inhabited islands was seriously affected by salt water intrusion and in the remaining islands the water quality was severely compromised. It is estimated that approximately 58 percent of the farmers and 14172 home gardeners on the islands were impacted upon by the tsunami.

Under this programme 9 individual projects are being undertaken, namely: Restoration of livelihoods of tsunami affected farmers in the Maldives. Tsunami emergency assistance programme. Emergency assistance to support affected rural communities in the Maldives. Immediate provision of agricultural inputs to worst affected fisher and farmer groups in the Maldives. Rehabilitation of marine fisheries and agriculture sectors. Replacement of inputs to farmers and home gardeners. Forestry programme for early rehabilitation of Asian tsunami affected countries. Island livelihood revitalization and development programme. Provision of agriculture machinery and equipment to strengthen agriculture after the tsunami. The projects 1 and 2 are aided by funding support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). These projects are being carried out jointly as both have similar goals. Under this programme a revolving fund has been setup in 26 of the tsunami affected major agriculture islands. The fund will provide loans to tsunami affected beneficiaries to be used for agricultural purposes. Fund Committees have been elected and Fund Officers have been given training in operating and monitoring the loans. Workshops to introduce the cooperative concept have also been conducted in the 26 target islands. These projects will endeavor to strengthen as well as develop agriculture extension services and facilities. The projects will also promote the concept of cooperative societies to farmers in the Maldives. Projects 3 to 7",
