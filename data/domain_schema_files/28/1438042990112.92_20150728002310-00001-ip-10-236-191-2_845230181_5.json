    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{10807=In 1987, Frost transferred the concept to Yorkshire Television and produced a full half-hour programme for ITV where a celebrity panel tries to guess whose house is being looked at. It ran in primetime on Friday nights for eight years on ITV and was rarely out of the top ten entertainment programmes on TV. Executive producers were Kevin Sim and Chantal Rickards. From 1996, it was produced by Frost's own production company, Paradine Productions, at Yorkshire Television. The show also moved to Sky1 for one series that same year. It was then moved to BBC One Daytime in 1997 until 2006. The final two BBC series were aired on BBC Two in 2007 until 2008, when it was finally axed by the BBC. However, a special aired in March 2011 for Red Nose Day 2011, as part of the marathon panel show 24 Hour Panel People., 14988=The panellists are either successful at identifying the guest, or Frost has to reveal their identity, after which they are interviewed and given a key-shaped trophy as a memento. Starting during Loyd Grossman's reign as location presenter, the geographic spread of the properties was extended with one of the properties on each show being located in the US and one in Europe. When Stefanie Powers took over her role in 2007, she was based in the US and conducted the US property tours, whilst UK based Lisa Snowdon conducted the European property tours., 9911=Through the Keyhole originally started as a segment on TV-am, first being broadcast on its launch day on 1 February 1983.[1] The idea was created by Kevin Sim and David Frost as a chance to look around some of the most influential homes with Loyd Grossman at the helm as the tour presenter. Grossman was mistakenly given the job after someone confused him with a journalist.[2] It became a regular feature of TV-am throughout 1983.[3], 12292=The programme returned in 2013 on its original broadcast channel ITV with Leigh Francis as Keith Lemon taking up the role of presenter and house detective. The new series was filmed at Pinewood Studios.[4][5] Dave Berry was a regular panellist during the first series. Celebrity guests on the show are a closely guarded secret until transmission. The first episode of the revived series aired on the day former host Sir David Frost died.[6], 6090=The show originally aired on ITV from 3 April 1987 to 1 May 1995, then it aired on Sky 1 from 22 February to 23 May 1996 before moving to BBC One from 7 April 1997 to 31 March 2006 and then its sister channel BBC Two from 26 March 2007 to 4 June 2008., 6544=In 2013, it was announced that the show would be revived for ITV, with Keith Lemon as the host., 13335=Before his death in August 2013, Frost gave his backing to ITV's remake saying \"I am delighted that the Keyhole format is now entering its fourth decade on TV. I know the pilot show went down very well with the studio audience and I wish Keith and his team the very best of luck for the series.\"[7]}",

Starting during Loyd Grossman's reign as location presenter, the geographic spread of the properties was extended with one of the properties on each show being located in the US and one in Europe. When Stefanie Powers took over her role in 2007, she was based in the US and conducted the US property tours, whilst UK based Lisa Snowdon conducted the European property tours. At the start of each episode, Frost introduces a panel of three celebrities, with the catchphrase \"And what a panel they are\u00a0...\" and some gently humorous or mocking descriptions. He then hands over to the location presenter who gives the panellists a guided tour of the property, noting particular items, though, there is typically a large amount of misdirection involved as the items pointed out by the presenter are not necessarily the most pertinent clues to the person's identity. Items not specifically mentioned may provide much more useful clues. Once completed, Frost reveals the identity of the guest to the audience, and the panel are given turns at guessing their identity. The audience participate with varying degrees of clapping according",
