    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{6099=Since its inception, the VERA model has been developed to account for regional variances. For example, in FY 1997 a geographic price adjustment was introduced to recognize the impact of regional variations in the cost of labor. In the FY 2002 VERA model, the two VISNs with the highest labor costs are VISNs 21 (San Francisco) and 3 (Bronx); the two VISNs with the lowest labor costs are VISNs 8 (Bay Pines) and 18 (Phoenix). VISNs 21 and 3 received positive funding adjustments of +$70 million and +$53 million, respectively, because of their higher labor costs. VISNs 8 and 18 received negative adjustments of -$57 million and -$20 million, respectively, because of their lower labor costs. In FY 2002, the geographic price adjustment was extended to cover all contract costs, both contract labor and non-labor. These contract costs include the cost of utilities. Additionally, the RAND Corporation is currently evaluating the VERA model and will have a final report this fall. The RAND Study is addressing a quantitative analysis of the following issues: improved case-mix adjustment; geographic differences in prices paid for non-labor inputs and contract labor costs; the impact of teaching and research programs; and, the impact of the facilities' physical plants. The first interim briefing to Congress on the status of the ongoing RAND VERA study, as required by the Senate Appropriations Committee, was provided on March 1, 2002. The next interim briefing to Congress will be provided during July 2002, and a final report will be submitted to Congress in October 2002., 18711=Prior to FY 2002, requests for supplemental adjustments would be evaluated in various ways before the Under Secretary for Health made a final decision. The process was not complete until about mid way into the fiscal year. In FY 2002, VHA reengineered the supplemental request process to make the determination part of the initial VERA allocation. This was accomplished by developing updated estimates of each network's projected FY 2002 financial status, to include estimates of all resources that would be available to each network and their estimated expenses for the year. The estimate of available resources included funds carried over from the prior year, estimated collections, estimated reimbursements, and the estimated VERA allocation of the medical care appropriation. The estimated expenses were based on the actual expenses of FY 2001, plus approved budget increases for inflation and pay raises, minus a two-percent efficiency target. Based on this analysis, it was determined that five networks should receive an adjustment to their initial VERA allocation. This adjustment was included as part of the initial VERA allocations on December 7, 2001. The table below provides a summary of VERA adjustments from FY 1999 through FY 2002. In FY 2000, VISN 9 repaid their FY 1999 adjustment. In FY 2001, funds were withdrawn from eighteen VISNs to fund the adjustment for four VISNs and a Congressional rescission., 8703=This brings me to GAO's most recent report issued in February this year, which is the subject of this hearing. Before I comment on GAO's specific recommendations, I would like to commend GAO for the professionalism and thoughtful analyses that characterize this, their third evaluation of the VERA model. GAO's five recommendations were as follows:, 10359=VHA is currently evaluating proposed changes to the FY 2003 VERA to be responsive to GAO's recommendations. Final decisions will be made by the Secretary. We hope to have final decisions in time to implement for the FY03 allocation. Some of the issues being addressed are:, 17203=The attached table shows the estimated impact on all networks of GAO's recommendations in FY 2002 compared to GAO's report estimates for FY 2001., 29790=Reviewed/Updated Date: November 10, 2009, 16453=While GAO may be correct in recommending more case-mix categories, additional time is needed to evaluate the appropriate method because of the significant differences in allocation results under the three approaches. Therefore, we are considering recommending that the Secretary delay a final decision until FY 2004. Additionally, the RAND Corporation is currently evaluating VERA and will report its conclusions and recommendations this fall. We hope that RAND's analysis will provide information on which a more informed decision can be made on model case-mix adjustment., 3964=May 14, 2002, 26579=Veterans and their family members who wish to contact the Department regarding a claim, benefits, or services, may call VA Toll-Free at 1 (800) 827-1000 or 1 (800) 829-4833 [TDD], or\u00a0Contact the VA\u00a0via the\u00a0web., 13738=GAO has also proposed a change to adjust the price split between Complex Care and Basic Care to reflect the current cost experience between these two groups rather than using a fixed ratio that reflects their FY 1995 relative costs. The Secretary will not approve a change which would create a disincentive for the enrollment and treatment of complex care patients, veterans who need treatment for services such as blind rehabilitation or spinal cord injury., 23963=Although we would like to minimize these adjustments by identifying and correcting the causes as GAO recommends, it is also important to evaluate these adjustments in relation to the system-wide impact of the VERA allocation model. The VERA model was used to allocate funds to 22 networks in FY 2002 and required an adjustment of 1.5 percent. It would be unrealistic to expect any model to be 100 percent perfect. However, we need to better understand what is causing certain networks to require adjustments year after year. It is certainly possible that part of the cause may be in the allocation model. However, the difficulty associated with eliminating excess capacity, adjusting the size of the work force, and shifting costly inpatient programs to more efficient health care delivery models in a Federal system may also be contributing factors., 7834=Additionally, the RAND Corporation is currently evaluating the VERA model and will have a final report this fall.

I will be happy to answer any questions the Committee may have.",
