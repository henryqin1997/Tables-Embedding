Of the remaining 282 accounts, 102 are active accounts, which means their last tweet was sent sometime in 2010. These 500 IDs yield a total of 282 actual accounts. \u00a0The 218 missing accounts no longer exist \u2013 we assume that a lot of them might have been Twitter engineering test accounts. The first 500 Twitter User IDs were generated between Tuesday, March 21, 2006 and Wednesday, July 12, 2006. \u00a0 (Note that 4 years later, Twitter is generating about 15 million new accounts per month.) We\u2019re not sure we can answer the second question, but we ran a quick little script to answer the first one. Who were the first 500 Twitter users? \u00a0And why would you care?
