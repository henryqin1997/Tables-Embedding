It is intersected in a westerly direction by a line of chalk hills, a continuation of the Chilterns, the highest elevation being White Horse Hill, alt. 893 ft. North of this is the White Horse Vale (so called from the figure of a horse cut out on the hill-side), and to the South lies the Vale of Kennet, watered by the Kennet stream. These tracts are well cultivated, and produce good crops of grain and corn, especially in the Vale of the White Horse. Dairy farms and commons abound; much of the surface is under woods, chiefly of oak and beech. Windsor Forest, covering upwards of 50,000 acres, lies in the East. The Thames flows along the entire Northern boundary (100 miles in extent); its tributaries are the Kennet, Lambourn, Ock, and Loddon. The Great Western Railway, the Thames, and 2 canals are the chief means of transit.
