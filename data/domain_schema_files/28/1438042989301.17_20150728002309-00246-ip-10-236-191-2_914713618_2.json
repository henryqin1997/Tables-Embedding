Please contact Kevin Flory (419-234-6200) for details on the work I've done so far. We don't have enough space for all this stuff. To help the group pare things down, I'm going to start an inventory of what's in here. There's a task (on the task list ToDo) to clean up the craft room. However, part of the problem with carrying out this task is that the craft room is simply crammed with cool stuff.
