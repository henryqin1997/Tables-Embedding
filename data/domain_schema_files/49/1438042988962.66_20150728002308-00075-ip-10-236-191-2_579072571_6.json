The differential scanning calorimetric analysis (DSC) of the amino acids before and after irradiation was made on a DSC-1 Star System from Mettler-Toledo. The Optical Rotatory Dispersion (ORD) spectra were obtained on a Jasco P-2000 spectropolarimeter with a dedicated monochromator. The FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Thermo-Scientific infrared spectrometer model Nicolet-6700 in reflectance mode using a ZnSe crystal as spectral window and sample support.}",
