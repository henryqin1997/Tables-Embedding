Shadows will appear in the area they are about to fall, and they can be avoided by running away. Players will be dealt with 600-1000 damage per rock, and being hit by multiple rocks is extremely dangerous., 42947=General Graardor can be fought inside Bandos' Stronghold in the God Wars Dungeon. He has no weakness and moderately high defence, and cannot be stunned or poisoned. He attacks with a powerful arm thrust that can frequently hit over 1500 damage. He also has a Ranged attack that is capable of hitting all players in the room for up to 500+ damage. Additionally, he has three minions: Sergeant Strongstack, who uses melee; Sergeant Steelwill, who uses Magic; and Sergeant Grimspike, who uses Ranged. Since the update on the 28th of January increasing Graador's maximum hit by 800-900 and the ease of K'ril Tsutaroth, he became the second most popular God Wars boss, with the prior having full worlds and several people attempting to take said worlds every hour. He is the only monster in the game to drop the Bandos hilt, used to construct the popular Bandos godsword. Because he is the second most popular God Wars Dungeon boss, the supply of Bandos hilts is the second\u00a0highest of all godsword hilts. He drops the highly coveted parts of the Bandos armour set, making competition fairly intense., 240634=A General Graardor plushie found during the 2010 Easter Event.}",
