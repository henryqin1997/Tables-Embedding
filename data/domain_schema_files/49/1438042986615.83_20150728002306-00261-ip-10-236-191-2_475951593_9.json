These studies are done by combining population-wide estimates of physical activity from national surveys with estimates of relative risk of inactivity for specific diseases from observational research studies. Four of the reviewed studies included both direct and indirect costs; 6 included only direct costs. The one study suggesting that inactive individuals have lower medical expenditures stratified the data by age, reporting an annual cost saving of $109 per inactive person aged 15 to 44 years compared with an expense of $87 per inactive person age 45 years and older. Similar methods have been used to develop estimates for 5 States (GA, MN, NY, SC, WA), with annual per capita direct medical costs attributable to physical inactivity ranging from $19 (WA) to $79 (GA) (185)., 114652=30.0-34.9, 134901=1996\u00961997, 135506=1987, 68682=As shown elsewhere in this report (see Part G. Section 1: All-Cause Mortality and Part G. Section 2: Cardiorespiratory Health), the cardiovascular benefits of regular physical activity for adults outweigh the associated cardiovascular risks, including the risk of sudden cardiac death and myocardial infarction. In addition, 7 epidemiologic studies published between 1984 and 2006 compared the incidence of sudden adverse cardiac events (i.e., cardiac arrest, sudden death, myocardial infarction) during or shortly after vigorous physical activity between less and more active people (Table G10.A3 [PDF - 164 KB] summarizes these studies). These studies uniformly reported a lower risk per minute of activity for more active people (Figure G10.4) (70-76)., 18495=1363.6, 114904=35.0-39.9, 114134=18.5-24.9, 134399=1995\u00961998, 134675=1997\u00962000, 120895=The protective effects of bicycle helmets have been firmly established, and their use is recommended for commuting, recreational, and competitive bicycling. A recent meta-analysis estimated that the use of bicycle helmets reduced the risk of death by nearly 75%, risk of head injury and brain injury by about 60%, and risk of facial injury about 50% (149). An estimated 107,000 unnecessary bicycle-related head injuries, $81 million in direct medical costs, and $2.3 billion in indirect health costs in 1997 resulted from bicyclists in the United States not wearing helmets (150)., 114395=25.0-29.9, 135728=2001\u00962002, 45984=Military recruits are young healthy adults who undergo 2 to 3 months of rigorous, often vigorous, aerobic and muscular training, primarily running, marching, drill, and general conditioning exercises. Typically, recruits have 5 to 6 days of activity per week with, on average, 40 minutes of running or marching, 10 minutes of drill (learning to march in unison), 10 minutes of general condition (calisthenics), and 10 minutes of stretching per day, for a weekly total of about 2,725 to 3,270 MET-minutes (35). This level of physical activity is approximately 6 times the currently recommended amount for the population (36). Recruits experience high levels of overuse musculoskeletal injuries during this period (11% to 37% for men, 22% to 67% for women) (37). The symptomatic onset of injuries corresponds closely to the dose of activity (38) (Figure G10.2)., 134141=1995\u00961996, 82575=7.2-10.1, 200034=Last updated: 7/29/2015, 30501=The methods within each survey enable comparison of injury rates among different sports within the age-group of interest (i.e., collegiate athletes, high school athletes, or children aged 7 to 13 years in organized community sports leagues) and similar enough to allow an examination of general patterns. In all surveys, an athlete participating in a practice or game was an \"athlete-exposure.\" From 1988-1989 through 2003-2004 the National Collegiate Athletic Association used standard methods to monitor the incidence of injury in 15 men's and women's collegiate sports (18;19). Each year approximately 250 schools voluntarily participated in the surveillance system. Injuries were counted if they occurred as a result of participation in practice or game, required medical attention by a team athletic trainer, and resulted in restricted participation for one or more days. From 1995 through 1997 data were collected from 250 athletic trainers working directly with high school sports programs on a daily basis (20). Injuries were counted if they caused cessation or participation on the day of or day after the onset; in addition, all fractures or dental injuries were counted. From 1999 to 2000, injury reports were collected from coaches in the community leagues for children aged 7 to 13 years in Pittsburgh (21). Injuries were counted if a coach came onto the field to check the condition of a player, if a player was removed from participation, or if a player needed any type of first aid during an event., 82750=3.0-4.25}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Table G10.1. Factors Associated With the Risk of Activity-Associated Adverse Events The factors that increase susceptibility to these adverse events also are diverse, and include the type of activity being performed (e.g., walking versus rugby), the dose of activity (the amount, as determined by the frequency, duration, and intensity), personal characteristics (e.g., age, physical activity habits), equipment or protective gear used (e.g., bike helmets), and environmental conditions (e.g., proximity to traffic, weather) (Table G10.1). The chapter also considers in detail sudden adverse cardiac events because they may result in severe outcomes (e.g., death, myocardial infarction), fear of them likely reduces participation in activity, and their occurrence can be reduced. Other types of adverse events (e.g., heat-related illness, infections) are mentioned largely to provide examples and maintain awareness of the broad array of potential adverse events. Physical activity-related adverse events are undesired health events that occur because a person is physically active. They may be mild or severe and include such diverse maladies as musculoskeletal injuries, cardiac arrhythmias, heat injuries, and infectious diseases. Musculoskeletal injuries are the most common type of physical-activity associated adverse event, have generated the most scientific study, and are the primary focus of this chapter. Musculoskeletal injuries may be sudden, such as a torn anterior cruciate ligament in the knee in a soccer player, or slow to develop, such as pain around the knee due to the iliotibial band syndrome in a runner or hiker.
