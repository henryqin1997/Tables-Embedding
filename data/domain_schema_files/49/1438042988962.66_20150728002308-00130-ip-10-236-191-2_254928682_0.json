In 1960 residents gained a voice in presidential elections. In 1973 the Home Rule Act was passed, which allowed DC residents to elect their own mayor and city council. However, all legislation that the city council passes must be approved by congress.

For these reasons, both historic and current, local Washingtonians ask that visitors to learn the reality of DC\u2019s status as an unrepresented district. When utilizing the resources of organizers and activists in DC, also realize that Statehood is a constant fight, and one that requires the support of allies to win. DC\u2019s lack of federal representation is marred in a history of racism and bigotry. Historically, DC\u2019s systematic disenfranchisement comes out of a legacy of racism and segregation.
