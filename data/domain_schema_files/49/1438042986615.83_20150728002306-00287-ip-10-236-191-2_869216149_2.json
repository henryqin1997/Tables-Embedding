            "High-priority, I am hesitant to revamp this dialog if the dialog's icons will be unfitting for this use...This is needed to make the file progress operation dialog be able to be collapsible. This dialog occurs when you copy or move, or delete a big file, or a big directory, and it takes time to perform. Details(default mode=collapsed, to hide excess(not normally used) info.) see: proposed(bottom-left icon vista-ey) http://tinyurl.com/djwymj actual fallback (unpractical): http://tinyurl.com/dl4bfa Bottom left uses \"arrow-up\" & \"arrow-down\". I need 2 arrows, one up, and one pointing down (perhaps arrows), to display that you are going to be collapsing or expanding the dialog to show/hide information. Clicking the arrow that is pointing up will change it to point down, and expand the dialog's size to show more information (technical statistic stuff) These I think need to be more subtle than the green ones, like the vista one (the one in the first image), we don't want this to stick out like a sore thumb. A good name could be in actions \"dialog-collapse\" && \"dialog-expand\" OR \"details-hide\" && \"details-show\" Most likely the first few, they seem to be more specific - sreich",

General purpose icons Missing Icons Table Please sort by module/application/priority As someone already noted, this is not the right page to complain or make suggestions about existing icon, this is just to know the remaining work. Screenshots are sometimes a better way to easily show the usage of the icon. Provide metaphores when possible this will help the artist to visualize our reqest faster and give a better understanding of the reqest. Please provide clear but short descriptions about the icons, it needs to help the artists in imagining a good metaphore to make your icon. This point is extremely important. You may obviously also link your description if it's going to be lengthy. This will help us to manage icon requests, and check if there are any possible duplicates. The most descriptive you are, the best it is for us. When providing icon names please try to make them compatible with the actual naming scheme. This page, being a wiki, obviously does not validate your request. Please take care when providing information about the icons. Note that this page is mainly for the team to know where is mostly needed the work, we'll do our best to fullfill your requests for 4.0 but however we can't guarantee that.",
