The fork outfitted on this XCT Comp is the RST Titan-15 Air. The fork boasts hydraulic lock-out with external rebound damping, tapered alloy steerer, magnesium lower legs, 32mm stanchions, and 140mm of travel. Drivetrain is just as important as anything else, so it makes sense that Jamis has selected Sram drivetrain. A Sram X.5 rear derailleur is matched up with a Sram X.5 front derailleur. Shifters a very vital as well, so it makes sense that Jamis selected the X.5 9 speed trigger shifters. All of these components work in conjunction < /br>",
