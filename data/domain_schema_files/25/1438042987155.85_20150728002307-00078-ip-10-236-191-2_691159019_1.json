I am a single mother with one child and also filed as head of household. It did also mention the EITC as I was going through.

When I attempted to get an estimate both on TurboTax and h&r block the refund that I would be getting back is approximately $77 with the only credit received is the eic.

The EIC is basically a tax credit for certain people who earn and income (hence the name of the credit) and have less than $48,279 of earned income.

To claim this credit you must have at least $1 of earned income, with\u00a0line 2\u00a0showing the minimum amount of earned income required to get the maximum EI credit. The amount of credit you receive or qualify for varies based on income and number of children so will differ from person to person. The \u201cthreshold phaseout amount\u201c\u00a0(lines 3 and 5 depending on filing status) and \u201ccompleted phaseout amount\u201d (lines 4 and 6 depending on filing status) are the adjusted gross income (AGI) ranges from where the EITC begins to phase out to where it reaches $0, or the income at or above which no credit is allowed. Example\u00a0on figuring the EITC:\u00a0Your AGI is $45,000, you are single, and you have two qualifying children. You cannot claim the EITC because your AGI is not less than the 2014 completed (maximum) phase out limit of $43,756.\u00a0However, if your filing status was married filing jointly, you would be able to claim some of the EITC because your AGI is less than $49,186\u00a0complete phase out limit. You cannot get the full EITC because your income is above the $23,260\u00a0threshold phase amount. Further\u00a0scenarios",
