The table below contains a high-level summary of Tested Reference Configurations. For more details on Cisco UCS servers in general, please see http://www.cisco.com/go/ucs , http://www.cisco.com/go/uconucs and the Related Hardware Documentation section below. Hardware Requirements UC on UCS hardware supports servers purchased as Collaboration SKUs or as Data Center SKUs, provided they meet the support policies described below. Mixed deployments of virtualized, non-virtual MCS and non-virtual \"bare-metal Software-only\" servers are supported, see http://www.cisco.com/go/ucsrnd . Note that because Cisco Unified Communications is composed of real-time media applications, there are certain support requirements that must be followed.

    "textAfterTable": "Related Hardware Documentation Monitoring and Alarming for Cisco UCS At this time on Cisco UCS, certain types of serviceability monitoring and alarming (such as hard drive failure) are only available via OS instrumentation. For UC on UCS this means alerts are generated by VMware in CIM format, and require VMware vCenter or equivalent CIM-compliant console. Refer to the UCS RAID Controller SMI-S Reference Guide for detailed information on this topic.
