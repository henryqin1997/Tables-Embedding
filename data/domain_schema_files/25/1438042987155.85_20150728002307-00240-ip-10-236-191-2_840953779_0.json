    "textBeforeTable": "If there\u2019s one thing that we\u2019re reminded of a few times a year here at the Weekend Box Office Report, it\u2019s that films targeted at black audiences are always ignored by many mainstream movie websites \u2026 until they open huge at the box office. \u2018The Best Man Holiday\u2018 is the latest film to prove that there\u2019s an entire group of moviegoers who aren\u2019t being given the films they obviously want to see, and hopefully its success will spur Hollywood into action, allowing for the production of more movies with black casts and filmmakers. Maybe. This is Hollywood, after all.

    "textAfterTable": "\u00a0 Although it couldn\u2019t quite dethrone Marvel\u2019s latest film from the top of the box office, \u2018The Best Man Holiday\u2019 opened to an incredibly strong $30 million, putting it at second place. If it\u2019s not profitable now, it certainly will be in the very near future. Since it\u2019s a holiday movie, it may even showcase strong legs as we approach the Christmas season, so this one may turn into a genuine sleeper hit. Of course, we\u2019ll track its progress here. But the top spot still went to \u2018Thor: The Dark World,\u2019 which took the expectedly large drop to gross $38 million, bringing it to a grand total of $146 million. Unless something disastrous happens, it should surpass the gross of its predecessor pretty soon, putting it well on the road to $200 million. And that\u2019ll be enough, really: the fantasy superhero epic has already done enough gangbusters business overseas to put it into the black. In third and fourth places respectively, \u2018Last Vegas\u2018 and \u2018Free Birds\u2019 showcased some surprising endurance, with each of them grossing various shades of $8 million. Neither are doing gangbusters business, but both are taking small enough drops each weekend to stay in theaters. Expect both of them to crack $50 million by next weekend. Family movies like \u2018Free Birds\u2019 always have legs and films that attract older audiences like \u2018Last Vegas\u2019 often bloom late. In fifth place, \u2018Bad Grandpa\u2018 passed the $90 million mark, so $100 million should",
