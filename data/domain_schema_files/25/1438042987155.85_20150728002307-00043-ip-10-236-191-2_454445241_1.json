Version 2.6.32.32.62 is the same version used in Ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS, and version 2.6.35.28.50 is the one used in Ubuntu Server 10.10 (currently masked). In our testing of 2.6.32.32.62, it has been very reliable and offers very good performance. One exception, which is common among 2.6.32-based kernels, is that it's recommended that you emerge net-misc/broadcom-netxtreme2 (package not on wiki - please add) if you have any Broadcom-based NICs, as the in-kernel drivers have compatibility issues with certain models. This kernel is a very good option if you want a relatively modern server kernel and do not need OpenVZ support. We use gcc-4.4.5 to build this kernel. It will use gcc-4.4.5 automatically, without requiring the user to use gcc-config., 10359=This kernel is based on the latest Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 kernel, and contains additional OpenVZ (virtual containers) patches from the OpenVZ project. It is a very stable and reliable kernel, and is recommended for use in production environments. The only major downside to this kernel is that it is based on Linux 2.6.18 -- some parts of the kernel are out-of-date, and it is not compatible with modern versions of udev. However, it is pretty trivial to downgrade udev to an earlier version on Funtoo Linux and this kernel has a track-record of being rock-solid. When stability is paramount, you put up with the udev downgrade, use this kernel, and can enjoy hundreds of days of uptime. For more information on how to use this kernel with Funtoo Linux, see the RHEL5 Kernel HOWTO., 23443=Once the Debian kernel sources are deployed, you should find a directory named linux-debian-version (e.g. linux-debian-2.6.32.30) under /usr/src. Update your the linux symlink to point on this directory:, 29000=This is needed to ensure that your system can boot up correctly for kernel versions >= 3.10.11.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "This page provides an overview of kernel features and stability information: Kernel Features and Stability Some compile fixes. Genkernel uses Funtoo Linux lvm2 rather than building its own. --firmware-dst - a new capability - you can now define where genkernel installs firmware. --firmware-src - a new option that works identically to --firmware-dir. --fullname can be used to specify the entire name of the kernel and initramfs images -- everything after kernel- and initramfs-. --build-src is a new option that is equivalent to the --kerneldir option. genkernel can use a build directory that is separate from the kernel source directory. This is enabled using the new --build-dst option. Funtoo Linux contains a forked/enhanced version of genkernel with the following new capabilities: Funtoo Linux Genkernel More information can be found in the Funtoo Linux Installation Guide. # boot-update # nano -w /etc/boot.conf # emerge openvz-rhel5-stable # echo \"sys-kernel/openvz-rhel5-stable binary\" >> /etc/portage/package.use  Many of the kernel ebuilds in Funtoo Linux support the very useful binary USE flag. By enabling this USE flag and emerging the kernel, the ebuild will automatically build a binary kernel image, initramfs and kernel modules and install them to /boot. The binary kernel image and initramfs can be used to boot your Funtoo Linux system without requiring any additional configuration. This is a great way to get a Funtoo Linux system",
    "textAfterTable": "Using Debian-Sources with Genkernel Important Debian-sources is now fully compatible with the binary USE flag and recommended for desktop users. The below example is valid for manual installation. At least 12G of /var/tmp required to build This section describes how to build a binary kernel with debian-sources and genkernel, and it also explains how to use Funtoo Linux's config-extract tool to list and create official Debian kernel configurations. First step: emerging the required packages The first step is to emerge: The Debian sources Genkernel itself This is achieved by running the following:  # emerge -av sys-kernel/debian-sources sys-kernel/genkernel Once the Debian kernel sources are deployed, you should find a directory named linux-debian-version (e.g. linux-debian-2.6.32.30) under /usr/src. Update your the linux symlink to point on this directory:  # cd /usr/src # rm linux # ln -s linux-debian-2.6.32.30 linux Alternatively, emerge the debian-sources with the symlink USE flag. Second step: Grabbing a configuration file If is now time to download the kernel configuration file. For this tutorial we will use a configuration file for AMD64 (several others architectures like MIPS or SPARC64 are available.) To view a complete list of available kernel configurations, type ./config-extract -l in the Debian kernel source directory:  ninja1 linux-debian-2.6.32.30 # ./config-extract -l ====== standard featureset ====== alpha: alpha-generic, alpha-legacy, alpha-smp amd64 armel:",
