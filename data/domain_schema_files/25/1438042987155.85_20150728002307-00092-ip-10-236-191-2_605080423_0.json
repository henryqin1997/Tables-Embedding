    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{4543=Kurt Busch is too strong this week to get relegated to dark horse status just because three drivers have already been profiled. Along with Earnhardt, he is the only other driver to sweep the top 10 on cookie-cutter courses in 2011. He also has more momentum than anyone else in the field with seven consecutive top-15s including last week's 14th-place finish that he earned despite crash damage late in the Coke Zero 400. Somehow, he is still not getting the respect he deserves from fantasy owners, however, and that gives you an opportunity to make up some ground on the competition., 8715=Without any previous Cup races at Kentucky, fantasy owners will need to find a suitable comparative. Luckily, this week there are two courses that will help set their roster and both of them have already hosted races in the 2011 season. Given its shape and size, Kentucky can be lumped into the same category as the similarly-configured, 1.5-mile tracks -- or the cookie-cutter courses. With 14 degrees of banking, it is now the flattest of these tracks, but that is only 1 degree less steep than Kansas Speedway -- where NASCAR visited just five weeks ago. Auto Club is slightly longer than Kentucky, but it is banked at 14 degrees -- the same as Kentucky -- which makes it a good comparative this week as well., 7400=The drivers most likely to win are those with the most experienced teams, but this will also be a good opportunity to take a risk on some dark horses. In the inaugural race at Chicagoland Speedway in 2001, Robert Pressley finished second in a Doug Bawel owned car and neither driver nor team were exactly household names. A rookie, Kevin Harvick, won the event. In the first race at Kansas Speedway that same year, a rookie named Ryan Newman finished second to Jeff Gordon. And Pressley earned another top-10 in his lightly-funded Ford., 13858=July 06, 2011, Dan Beaver, Special to NASCAR.COM, NASCAR.com, 5786=This could be a great weekend for Hendrick Motorsports since there are ample reasons to start both Jimmie Johnson and Dale Earnhardt Jr. Like the No. 24 team, the 48 earned five consecutive top-10s at Kansas. Two of Johnson's runs there have been outside the top five with a ninth in 2009 and a seventh this year, but he also has a victory in 2008 and a second in 2010 to offset those slightly more modest results. This season, he has not been quite as strong as in the past on the cookie-cutter courses, but with the Chase looming, it is time for the team to step up their effort., 3079=If one completely buys the premise that Kansas is the best comparative for Kentucky, Greg Biffle might actually be a favorite this week instead of a dark horse. He is so good on that track that he entered the STP 400 five weeks ago with six top-three finishes in his previous seven attempts, but he failed to dominate as projected. His finish of 10th was respectable especially if one discounts the three fuel mileage gamblers, but it was not what was expected of him. On the other hand, he ended the 2010 season with three consecutive top-fives on similarly-configured, 1.5-mile tracks and has three top-15s in his past three attempts on that track type this year, so he is an acceptable risk.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Cookie-cutter tracks (past three years) Fantasy Power Rankings Tony Stewart has thrust himself into the limelight in an unfavorable way after delivering an ultimatum to the entire field that he will punish drivers for blocking. Whether he is one of the reader's favorite drivers or if fantasy owners agree that someone should police this type of on track activity is entirely meaningless -- this has taken the team's focus off the matter at hand, which is finishing in the top 10. Stewart has said that he does not care if his attitude costs him a position in the Chase or robs him of victories, which makes him a risky proposition for the next several weeks. Other drivers may choose to test his resolve and put him in a precarious position or he may alternately get in a situation where retaliation denies him a strong finish -- like at Infineon two weeks ago -- but fantasy owners should allow this to play itself out before committing to the No. 14. Underdogs Last week, Joey Logano had an opportunity to put the No. 20 team in Chase contention. With a slightly stronger push from Kasey Kahne or a little less damage to his Toyota, he might have earned the Coke Zero 400 victory instead of Ragan, which along with getting elevated into the top 20 in points, would mean he has the current claim to",
    "textAfterTable": "Uncertainty is the enemy of fantasy owners. At Kansas, Ambrose was a great dark horse pick on the heels of his three consecutive results of sixth or better in the first three cookie-cutter races this season. His native skills as a road-course racer should also have given him a leg up on the competition since that was one of the flattest tracks on the schedule. Yet, he never found any real speed during the weekend after qualifying deep in the field in 35th, losing a lap during the race and finishing 26th in the STP 400. The same rationale that made him attractive then is still true, so if you are willing to gamble, he could be your ace in the hole, but it is impossible to recommend him before the weekend's activities begin.
