The 14 playoff qualifiers all played best-of-seven series in the first round. The East semifinals were best-of-seven affairs, while the highest remaining seed in the West earned a bye. The remaining two West teams played a best of five series. Conference and League final series were best of seven. The WHL divided into three divisions: The East and Central divisions formed the Eastern Conference, and consisted of five teams per division. The West division was made up of the seven B.C. and U.S.-based teams. The Tacoma Rockets relocated to Kelowna, British Columbia to become the Kelowna Rockets. The Calgary Hitmen joined the WHL as its 17th franchise, playing in the Central division.
