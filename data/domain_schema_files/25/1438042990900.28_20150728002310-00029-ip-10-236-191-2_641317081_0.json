The O'Neal family was one of 10 families that were chosen to have a short history included in the edition because members of the family had lived in Pagosa for over 100 years. The O'Neals arrived in southwestern Colorado in the 1870s. And Mrs. O'Neal was kind enough to help me out with her family's history., 60979=You may not be registered to vote. It will soon be too late to do so. If you didn't vote in the general election last year - and many of you didn't - you need to re-register. You may pick of a form here at the library, or at the County Clerk's office. It will be a mail ballot and Oct. 4 is the last day to register. Almost half of the 4,622 voters aren't registered now., 11532=Chilling omens presaging the coming winter grinned down on Pagosa Country this past week. Snow dusted the higher peaks Sept. 14. The thermometer added its own special warning Monday by dipping to 31 degrees, the first freezing temperature since June 4., 19536=A long-time resident of Pagosa Springs, Mrs. Nellie Hannah O'Neal was born to Ida and Fred Tallman on May 18, 1901, in Penn Yan, N.Y. She died Sept. 18, 1999, in Durango at the age of 98., 119928=Nichol\u00e1s Ad\u00e1n Talamante receives a warm welcome home by big sister, Marissa. Nichol\u00e1s was born June 22, 1999, in Mercy Medical Center of Durango. He weighed 6 pounds, 8-1/2 ounces and was 20 1/2-inches long. Proud parents are Adam and Angelene Talamante. Paternal grandparents are Andres and Della Talamante. Maternal grandparents are Roy and Kathy Vega. Maternal great-grandparents are Frank and Emily Mestas. Maternal great-great-grandparents are Alfonso and Sophia Cantu., 86312=I love watching the Lady Pirates, complete with all the spectacle, the triumphs, the tragedies, the thrills. I've covered the sport for the SUN since 1987 and my obsession grows stronger each year., 78061=\"May this day show me an ocean. / I ought to be on my way. . . . / I'll stay away from you no more, / I've come home to stop yearning.\", 43206=Although we're still counting tickets, we know that attendance this year exceeded all existing records for both the Wine and Cheese Tasting and the Colorfest Picnic and Concert. Well over 300 people attended both evenings and a great time was had by all. I'm sure it is no surprise to anyone that behemoth efforts go into this fantastic weekend by staff, board members and volunteers. Suellen and Morna are first on the list of those who expended large amounts of blood, sweat and tears for weeks in preparation and clearly are largely responsible for the great success. Jean Sanft and Nita Heitz are most likely still nursing sore hands from cutting pounds and pounds of cheese for us. Those who served the wines for us include: Sue Gast, Monica Greene, Ken and Jan Harms, Mike and Lauri Heraty, Ron and Sheila Hunkin, Mike Markley, Don and Mary McKeehan, Kelly McKeenan, Robert and Tina Soniat, Tom and Ming Steen, Lynnis Steinert, Doug Trowbridge, Dalas and Carrie Weisz, Cappy White and Stan Zuege., 102007=At this meeting, it was decided that the director of planning and building, the planning commission and the Vision Committee should proceed on working together on the survey results. The first planning workshop session will be on Oct. 27, at 7 p.m. at the commissioners meeting room and is open to the public., 45296=We've all been there. You have just hired what appears to be the perfect employee after an extensive and exhaustive interviewing process. You're pumped. After a month or so, you notice that your office has been turned upside down - work is incorrect, loyal employees who have worked for you forever are jumping ship. They grab the weekly SUN right off the press to check the \"Help Wanted\" section, mumbling something about how \"things have really changed around here.\" Somehow that \"perfect employee\" has turned into your worst nightmare. Take heart, help is on the way. Jim Lawrence, CIC, of Anco Southwest Insurance Services, Inc., will present \"Interviewing Magic: How to Hire the Ideal Employee\" at the Sports Page Bar and Grill from 1 to 3 p.m. on Oct. 9. In this workshop, Jim will share an interviewing and hiring process that will greatly increase your chances of hiring the ideal employee. This process is implemented by many successful businesses throughout the nation and it works!, 51209=Some of the peaks surrounding Pagosa are already capped with white, a harbinger of things to come. Snow is seriously on my mind. \"Snowriders\" (the latest term for skiers and snowboarders) - Wolf Creek Ski Area pre-season lift passes will go on sale this Saturday, through Oct. 3. To get your pass in person, go to the ski area ticket office from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. You can have a new mug shot taken for this season's pass or if last year's was a real \"glam\" shot, those good folks in the ticket office will recycle. Can't make it up there in person - mail your contract and check to Wolf Creek Ski Area, Box 2800, Pagosa Springs, CO 81147 or phone 264-5639 and give them your credit card number. The pass can then be put together on your first day of skiing., 117002=The family and friends of Leo Landon and Victoria Stewart would like to announce their marriage. Leo and Victoria were united in marriage on Sunday, Sept. 19, 1999, at 2 p.m. at the home of Les and Francis Bleeker with Steve Rogan officiating. It is with great joy, we the family of Leo Landon, welcome our new family member. We look forward to sharing in your love and happiness for many years to come. The Landon's will continue to reside in Pagosa Springs. Special thanks to Les and Francis Bleeker for all your love and hard work to make this a very special day. How blessed they are to have friends like you., 40032=Richard Bracken joins us next with Orton Homes located at 160 Hawk Place right here in Pagosa. You can give this gentleman a call to discuss either your custom home building needs or remodeling plans you might be considering. You can reach Richard at 731-2243 for more information., 55730=Upcoming art classes include: \"Drawing and Painting\" taught by Lisa Brown. This class will provide children with the opportunity to try their hands at a variety of basic drawing and painting techniques and give them the freedom to experiment in making art. Classes will be held Mondays from Oct. 4 through Oct. 25, from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m. Tuition is $15 (materials included)., 12890=Meanwhile, the Tuesday low temperature was 31 degrees, just one step on the thermometer below freezing. On June 4, the mercury recorded 27 degrees as the last freeze of the spring. For 1999, there have been 107 growing days between frosts, better than average, but not quite enough time for corn or tomatoes to mature. The average growing season in Pagosa Springs is 88 days, according to the county agent., 46978=SunDowners 2000, 56428=\"Crafts from Many Cultures\" with Lisa Brown. This class will expose children to a wide variety of folk art crafts from around the world, allowing them to learn the art history of various cultures. Students will then use this knowledge to create two and three dimensional projects. Classes will be held Thursdays from Oct. 7 through Oct. 28, from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m. Tuition is $15 (materials included)., 13592=Precipitation for the week amounted to 0.49 inches, scattered across four days. The precipitation total for September is 1.45 inches, compared to the long time September average precipitation total of 1.89 inches., 109603=It is very hard to support our children in athletic or after-school events. Practices and games fall during regular working hours and when you are struggling already this becomes a major issue. Also, I myself was excited to hear Pagosa schools offered such wonderful after-school programs and even happier to hear we now have a town transit in place. Now, I've learned the city bus does not go to the schools at all when these programs end at 4:30 p.m and 5:30 p.m. Whose idea was it to let the children out of school on Friday at 1:30 p.m.? The parents?, 66926=But it was important to us to get in some trail time before the snows. So in late August we headed south on the Continental Divide Trail from Wolf Creek Pass for a day hike to the rocky bump that is called Alberta Peak. Although there were plenty of people at the Pass, posing for snapshots in front of the identifying sign, few of them left the pavement to follow the trail that crosses the meadow to the bridge. Once we were in the trees we were alone. The trail climbs to a rocky ridge, where marmots and pikas whistled and squeaked at us. Near Alberta Peak a pair of falcons practiced aerobatics in the windy updrafts. All in all it was a heady day and the fact that we made it back to our car at 2 p.m., five minutes before the rain hit, was icing on the cake., 68028=And then we started thinking about sharing the woods with hunters. Until this year, all our hiking in Pagosa Territory has been in July or early August - high summer. Not even near hunting season. We've heard the hunting horror stories, from the guy who shot his wife as she reached for an apple from the tree in the orchard to the couple who were picked off as they road their motorbikes along a forest road. Images of trigger-happy hunters filled our dreams. We didn't want to be anyone's targets., 57847=More special items are coming in for the raffle. We will be displaying them soon. Monograms Plus donated another elegant vest, Liz Allen brought in a beautiful quilted Christmas wall hanging; a money wreath and basket are among the many prizes. The raffle will be on Nov. 6, at 6 p.m. as part of the Civic Club Bazaar. We have raffle tickets here., 108921=A petition has been started to submit to the next board meeting on Oct. 14. I ask RV owners who are members of the association and have RV's, to call me at 731-3858. This action is totally unreasonable to enforce after all these years of indifference., 33422=Nellie had come to Pagosa Springs from Penn Yan, N.Y., where she was born on May 18, 1901. She attended school in Penn Yan and then took secretarial training in Rochester, N.Y. She came to Pagosa Springs with a friend who was ill., 57312=You may call 264-2835 to register by phone or for more information. More program information is also available on our website: www.pagosa.k12.co.us/edcenter., 118492=Carla Marie Verce passed away Sunday, Sept. 19, 1999., 39588=Susan is a public accountant with thirteen years in business plans, budgets and taxes. She can also give you a hand in the area of mortgage lending and/or assistance on first purchase or second home, investment rentals or commercial real estate. A business loan from the small business administration is yet another option available to you. She invites you to call her at 731-2500 to learn more about Balcomb Business Works., 102336=If we are to have long-range planning and we are to implement the changes recommended by the survey then the most important issue before us as a community is the up-and-coming ballot issue Resolution No. 99-54 in November (growth-related revenues). On Oct. 5, there will be a public information meeting held to educate the public on the pros and cons of this issue. Please, if you are interested in long-range planning in our county, attend this meeting at the county fairgrounds building at 7 p.m., 47013=A big reminder to those desiring SunDowner hosting privileges in 2000. On Oct. 1 at 8 a.m. we will accept requests here at the Visitor Center on a first-come, first-served basis. There seems to be a great deal of competition for these babies due to the limited number available (10) and the increasingly large number of businesses who want to host. I can assure that they will go like hotcakes, so please mark your calendar to either be here or send someone to sign up for a 2000 SunDowner., 46348=The fee for this event $15 and Chamber business members will receive invitations in the mail. Give us a call at 264-2360 if you have questions. Mark your calendars for this one, folks, to avoid that \"turnstile syndrome\" in your place of business., 33673=Shortly after her arrival in Pagosa Springs, \"Buck\" O'Neal swept her off her feet. Buck O'Neal and Nellie Tallman were married by Justice of the Peace Archie Toner at the Toner Ranch in Hinsdale County on Sept. 30, 1930., 53958=The Education Center's \"After Hours\" tutoring program begins Oct. 4 in the elementary school.

A snack is served each day at 3:20 p.m. before tutoring and enrichment classes begin. Children must be currently enrolled in tutoring for enrichment classes to attend Klubroom activities., 118032=The wedding party included: Mark Sudden and Brian Leewitt as best men, Joleen Penton as matron of honor, Angela Rubio as maid of honor, Shanley Lujan as junior bridesmaid, and Ryan Sudden as ring bearer., 56134=\"Art with Tessie Garcia.\" This class will enable children to experience a wide variety of art activities. Activities will change monthly. Classes will be held Wednesdays from Oct. 6 through Oct. 27, from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m. Tuition will be $15 (materials included)., 30686=of Sept. 26, 1974, 66716=And since our last major backpack trip took place in spring of 1997, we are not in the best of shape for a major trek. (When I say that, Tom gives me The Look. Okay, I'm not in great shape.), 19743=Mrs. O'Neal married John Eben \"Buck\" O'Neal on Sept. 30, 1930, north of Pagosa Springs at the Toner Ranch in Hinsdale County., 73120=It turns the inside of parked cars into furnaces. It shimmers off highways and parking lots. It makes your hair hot. It makes your glasses slide down your nose. And it does all of this in late September when the worst of it has been chased away by \"cool\" fronts and hurricanes., 55400=October is also Community Safety Month. Children are invited to attend safety workshops on Tuesdays from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m. Guest speakers and topics include: Officer George Daniels (bike safety), Fire Chief Warren Grams (fire safety) and EMS Staff (first aid tips). Tuition for this series or workshops is $12., 59948=The Library of Congress will mark its 200th birthday next April.

Join us by stopping in and signing our large greeting card that will be sent on to Washington., 118566=Mrs. Verce was born in Durango on Dec. 12, 1932, and was a fourth generation, lifelong resident of Durango. Her great-grandfather Dan Pargin moved to the Piedra River Valley in 1876 and started the family ranch which is still operating as a working cattle ranch., 65884=The PSAC is sponsoring a fun-filled evening with a performance by the Creede Repertory Theatre players.

Tickets include dinner, cocktails and the show, all starting at 6:30 p.m. Get your tickets at Moonlight Books, the Library, or Wolf Tracks Bookstore. See you there., 117736=Jean, Jennifer and son Dylan Lindberg were married on Aug. 14, 1999, in Pagosa Springs, at the home of Jenny Bell. Jennifer is the daughter of Ruth and Bud Read of Pagosa Springs. Jean is the son of Mark and Dena Sudden of Pagosa Springs, and Myron Lindberg of Ventura, Calif., 20412=After her husband passed away in January 1953, Mrs. O'Neal made walking her preferred mode of transportation whenever she would go to work, visit friends, attend church, choir practices, various other meetings or conduct business in town. A former clerk and recorder for Archuleta County, Mrs. O'Neal also served as clerk of the 6th District Court, switchboard operator for the phone company, and served on the county's Office of Price Administration during World War II., 66566=Since Tom and I moved here at the end of July, we haven't had much time to do one of the things we came here for, namely, to hike., 63659=Joseph Leal channels his love of the outdoors into the fine art of wood carving and metal sculpture. Living in Pagosa Springs has inspired Joseph to create unique carvings such as bears, eagles, hummingbirds and trout. He refers to his art as \"life's simple things.\" To culminate the trio, Tom Cardin will display his fantastic photography for an additional two weeks.

The seasonal attendance record set was 202,053 skier days, a 28 percent increase. The increase is attributed to early season snowfall permitting the Oct. 30 opening date., 34588=Buck worked a variety of jobs. He was a trouble-shooter for the telephone company, a \"powder\" (demolition) man on construction jobs clearing the roadway, a hunting and fishing guide and town marshal among other things.

Now, I have to tell him I can only make it to one game as it is at 6:30 p.m. and the rest are at 4 p.m. He is not alone as other parents will not be able to make it either. My son filled out a form for Big Brothers in February of this year. In March we received a call stating it had been received. As of Sept. 17, we have not heard another word., 64990=No, this is not a swim meet for local radio and newspaper personalities.

Low-pressure systems containing colder air and originating in the Gulf of Alaska or northwestern Canada and moving from west to east drop into the United States, forcing the monsoon conditions to remain south. The key to moisture in the fall and winter pattern is the location of high altitude jet streams. A jet stream crossing the Four Corners area often causes precipitation.}",
