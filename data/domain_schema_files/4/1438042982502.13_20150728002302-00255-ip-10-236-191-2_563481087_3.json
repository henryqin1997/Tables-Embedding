Hua Hin city provides an excellent example of an area where urbanization has flourished due to tourism. This study focuses on how the dynamic urban horizontal expansion of the seaside city of Hua Hin is constrained by the coast, thus making sustainability for this popular tourist destination\u2014managing and planning for its local inhabitants, its visitors, and its sites\u2014an issue. The study examines the association of land use type and land use change by integrating Geo-Information technology, a statistic model, and CA-Markov analysis for sustainable land use planning. The study identifies that the land use types and land use changes from the year 1999 to 2008 have changed as a result of increased mobility; this trend, in turn, has everything to do with urban horizontal expansion. The changing sequences of land use type have developed from forest area to agriculture, from agriculture to grassland, then to bare land and built-up areas. Coastal urban growth has, for a decade, been expanding horizontally from a downtown center along the beach to the western area around the golf course, the southern area along the beach, the southwest grassland area, and then the northern area near the airport., 3177=Land use and land cover patterns for 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008 were mapped by the use of LANDSAT Thematic Mapper data (row/path: 51/139 for LANDSAT 4 MSS and row/path: 51/129 from LANDSAT 5 TM and LANDSAT 7 ETM+), which have a 30-m ground resolution (except for the thermal IR band (band 6), which has a 120-m resolution) and seven spectral bands. A modified version of the Anderson scheme of land use/cover classification was adopted the categories include: (1) water body or sea (2) urban or built-up area (3) agriculture (4) grassland or scrubland (5) bare land and (6) sparse forest., 18540=The matrix result shows how many possibilities there are by which class I (from column) in the previous land use image can change to be each class in the next period (time t + n). The result shows that it is the possibility of a pixel in the year 1999 to be unchanged after a specific time period (three years). It shows how many pixels of land use in the year 1999 can change to be the state of another land use type in the year 2002, and so on. The percentage of escalating urban pixel of the CA LU in each year is 79.87% (years 1999 to 2002) (Table 3), 75.73% (years 2002 to 2005) (Table 5), and 86.48% (years 2005 to 2008) (Table 7), respectively. This could be an accurate way of displaying the escalating image of urban growth of the Hua Hin municipality.}",

The supervised classification image is well fitted with the representative pixel and can distinguish the land use class efficiently. The overall accuracy assessment from Maximum Likelihood technique ( Figure 3 Supervised classification by the Maximum Likelihood technique was applied to classify the LANDSAT images. The 30 training areas were designed and drawn to scale at the same position in the raw image to reserve the pixel spectral of each land use class. In addition, the separability of each training area ( . LANDSAT images were enhanced using linear contrast stretching and histogram equalization to improve the image to help identify ground control points in rectification. Images were rectified to a common UTM coordinate system based on 1:50,000 scale topographic maps. These data were resampled using the Nearest Neighbor algorithm, so that the original brightness values of pixels were kept unchanged. etc .
