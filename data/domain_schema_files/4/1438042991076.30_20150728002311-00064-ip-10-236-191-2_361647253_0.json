Shooter, who has shared the stage with Alice in Chains and written songs for the Oak Ridge Boys, was playing drums at the age of five, taught himself how to play piano and picked up the guitar at 14. In 1996, at the age of 16, Jennings and his father recorded an album together called Fenixon (a play on the words \"phoenix\" and \"son\") but couldn't find a label to distribute it. It was never released but some of the material was remastered and used for the album Waylon Forever. In 2001, after he discovered rock 'n' roll and, driven by a sound he heard coming together in his head -- something like Lynyrd Skynyrd mutating into Guns N' Roses -- Jennings left Nashville to seek his own musical identity in Los Angeles. Once there, Jennings assembled a band, Stargunn, which tore up the local club scene, built a rabid following and earned praise from the local music press. But the Hollywood party scene eventually began to bother him. \"I was posing as a rocker -- a country guy trying to be something he wasn't,\" said Jennings. In March of 2003, he dissolved Stargunn and moved to New York City to spend time",
