These applications are described below. 1-Wire To demonstrate the Example Programs Public Domain basic API, but can diverge in API implementation by taking advantage of particular system or adapter features. 1-Wire DS1411. A third, 'other' implementation category provides the standard DS9097U-E25 or DS9097U-S09, ds9097U-009, Application Note 192). Maxim sells several DS2480B-based serial adapters, such as the operations into serial communications packets to the DS2480B. The only components that must be provided for a userial platform are the serial port read/write primitives (see 1-Wire operations, and then sends the results back to the serial port. The source code converts the intended 1-Wire Line Driver Master. The DS2480B receives commands over the serial port, performs 1-Wire DS2480B, a Universal Serial Application Note 126). The userial build assumes that the user has a serial port (RS-232) and wants to utilize Maxim's communication functions (see 1-Wire There are three standard ways to code the lowest level of the API. The first method is called \"general\" and the second is called \"userial\". The general build requires an implementation of the primitive link-level All the platform-specific code in the Public Domain Kit is organized into a few files (TODO templates) for easy porting to different platforms. These files represent the lowest level of the API that is hardware-dependent.",

(Application does not currently support the H or Z versions of the Thermochron.) tstfind Simple application that finds all 1-Wire devices on the network. assembly language routines Assembly language routines that represent low-level 1-Wire bus protocol algorithms such as reset/presence detect, byte I/O, and bit I/O. The routines are available for the following types of microcontrollers: 6303, 8051, 808X, ATMEL (ATmega103), and PIC (16C54, 12C508A). What's New in Version 3.10 Added Macintosh OSX builds for serial and usb (libusb) 1-Wire adapters. Removed 16-bit DOS, 16-bit Windows, and Windows CE/PocketPC builds. Updated humutil.c with fixes for convert errors. Added the applications swtduo, swtmain1c, and swtmulti to support the DS2413, DS28E04-100, and the DS2408 respectively. Changed the search CRC calculation to account for the changing DS28E04-100 serial number. Fixed owRelease() in the \"multiport\" and the \"DS9490\" builds. The code should now release the adapter correctly. Precompiled Binary Builds The Public Domain Kit was ported to several platforms, which are available for download below. Each build contains the source code, the make files or project files, and the executables. Note that the userial implementations require a DS2480B-based serial adapter such as the DS9097U-009, DS9097U-S09, DS9097U-E25, or DS1411.",
