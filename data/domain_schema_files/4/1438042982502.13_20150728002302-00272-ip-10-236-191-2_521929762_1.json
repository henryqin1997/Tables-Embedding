The Earth Cruiser helped to spark the beach cruiser revolution which has been a part of beach-city culture ever since. This revolution hasn\u2019t stopped, Jamis has merely shifted focus to other forms of two wheeled machines. Today Jamis develops and produces top of the line Road and Mountain bikes. Leveraging their 30+ years of experience, Jamis is able to craft Race driven performance, as well as high quality trickle down products for the average rider. Jamis has a goal to build the perfect bike, which might be an impossible goal, however to Jamis, it\u2019s the only one worth doing.}",
