    "textAfterTable": "Booking Information We recommend that you book early as dates fill fast. When booking you will be asked for your date, departure station and time of train. Please ensure you include all members of your party as it may not be possible to add extra people at a later date. If you wish to sit with another family it will all need to be on one booking. Seats are in blocks of four around a table - if your party is larger seats will be split across the aisle so that you can all see each other. Please be aware however, in this situation, you may be sharing that table with another party. You will be asked for the ages of the child(ren) in December so that we can give the correct age appropriate gift. It does not matter if this is a little inaccurate, as each child will be asked on the day by Santa and his helpers. If you feel a child over 3 years is mature for their age you may select the next age bracket. However, legal safety restrictions apply to toys for children under 3 years. Babies under 1 year are not allocated a seat but are given a gift for 0-12 months to ensure Santa treats every child equally.
