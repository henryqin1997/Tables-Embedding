The oxygen comprising plasma is preferably derived at least in part from at least one of O2, O3, N2O, and NOx. Preferred parameters for the exposing in a dual plate capacitively coupled reactor include an RF power range of from 300 to 1000 watts, a pressure range of from 1 Torr to 6 Torr, a temperature range of from 100\ufffd C. to 450\ufffd C., a spacing between the plates of from 400 to 600 mils, an oxygen gas exposure flow of from 500 to 1500 sccm, an inert gas flow (i.e., He and/or Ar) of from 200 sccm to 800 sccm, and a treatment time of from 20 to 100 to more seconds. It is a preferred intent of the exposing to further not transform the whole or all of the dielectric layer from one base chemistry to another base chemistry by the exposing. An outermost portion of the exposed layer might experience a slight reduction in carbon content, but otherwise that portion and the whole of the layer is not transformed from one fundamental material to another even in spite of the low k reducing or resulting property. In one preferred aspect of the invention, the exposing comprises at least 20 seconds of processing time. More preferably and in preferred sequence, the processing comprises at least 40 seconds, 60 seconds, 80 seconds, and 100 seconds of oxygen containing plasma exposure. The plasma exposing is preferably ineffective to appreciably etch the interlevel dielectric layer., 32094=In a more specific example, methylsilane or trimethylsilane is combined with N2O in a reaction chamber. A pressure within the chamber is maintained at from about 300 mTorr to about 30 Torr, and is preferably maintained at from about 1 Torr to about 10 Torr. An exemplary reaction chamber comprises a spacing from about 400 mils to about 600 mils with methylsilane being flowed into the chamber at a rate from about 25 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) to about 2000 sccm (preferably at from about 50 sccm to about 250 sccm). The N2O is flowed into the reaction chamber at a rate from about 50 sccm to about 3000 sccm (preferably at a rate from about 100 sccm to about 1500 sccm, and more preferably at a rate of from about 500 sccm to about 1200 sccm), and, additionally, helium is flowed into the reaction chamber at a rate of about 500 sccm to about 5000 sccm (preferably from 1000 sccm to about 3000 sccm). A radio frequency (RF) power within the chamber is maintained at from about 50 watts to about 500 watts, and preferably from about 100 watts to about 200 watts. The semiconductor substrate (such as a monocrystalline silicon wafer) is provided within the chamber and maintained at a temperature from about 25\ufffd C. to about 450\ufffd C., 20723=This patent resulted from a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser.

It is to be understood, however, that the invention is not limited to the specific features shown and described, since the means herein disclosed comprise preferred forms of putting the invention into effect. The invention is, therefore, claimed in any of its forms or modifications within the proper scope of the appended claims appropriately interpreted in accordance with the doctrine of equivalents. After forming the dielectric layer, the nitrogen comprising plasma to which the layer is exposed preferably comprises one or more of N2, NH3, N2H4, N2O, and NOx. More preferably, the plasma exposing is preferably void of oxygen atoms therein. Wherein the dielectric layer is formed by chemical vapor deposition in a chamber, such as described above, the exposing preferably occurs within the chamber without removing the substrate from the chamber between the forming and the exposing. Again, the plasma exposing like in the first described example is preferably conducted to be ineffective to appreciably etch the interlevel dielectric layer. Further, a whole of the dielectric layer subjected to the exposing is preferably not transformed from one base chemistry to another by the exposing. Preferred temperature, pressure, power, space arrangements, flows, and treatment times are as described above with respect to the first described embodiments.
