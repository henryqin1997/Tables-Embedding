    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{65043=The women\u2019s and men\u2019s teams will travel to Piedmont College on Tuesday for a 6:00 and 8:00 double header. On Friday, the Eagles will kick off their 2013 home slate at 6:00 PM against region foes Piedmont International University. Following the men\u2019s game, the Lady Eagles will host Pensacola Christian College at 8:00., 29521=Clearwater carried its momentum into the new half and held a 45-40 lead with 16:30 left. At that point in the game, the visiting Eagles had been whistled for enough fouls to place Clearwater in the bonus for the remainder of the game. Despite being cautious with the foul totals, Toccoa fought back to regain the advantage with 7:17 left to play, 60-59. TFC would not be able to hang onto the lead and would eventually be defeated 84-77., 57681=TFC has now won four of its last five games, and own a 4-2 region record. TFC will travel to Piedmont International University on Saturday. The Eagles defeated PIU 90-50 in December. TFC will host Emmanuel College and Berry College on Monday and Tuesday, respectively. Both games will begin at 7:00 PM., 97316=TFC will travel to Piedmont International University and Warren Wilson College on February 11 and 12, respectively. The Eagles return home to host North Greenville University on February 14 at 7:00. The final home game of the year will be on February 16 at 4:00 as TFC hosts Johnson and Wales University., 32771=The defeat to CIU was TFC\u2019s first loss in its last 6 games. The Eagles will travel to Pensacola Christian College (Feb. 13) and Clearwater Christian College (Feb. 14) for region games that will go a long way in determining region tournament seeding. Currently, the Eagles sit in 2nd place in the region with a 8-2 mark., 54977=Jon Sauls and the Eagles jumped to an early 16-7 lead just 5 minutes into the first half. TFC continued its hot shooting throughout the first 15 minutes of gameplay, and built a lead that swelled to 36-17 when Sauls drained back to back three pointers. Trailing 45-25 with 3:15 left in the first half, Pensacola scored 8 consecutive points in less than a minute\u2019s time to cut TFC\u2019s lead to 45-32. TFC was forced to call a timeout, and slowed Pensacola\u2019s momentum to take a 47-32 lead into the half., 46992=Berry strung together a 13-0 run during the next three minutes of game time and cut the deficit to 65-51 with 6:01 on the clock. With anxiety growing in the stands, TFC appeared to be out of the woods holding a double-digit lead until Berry\u2019s Hunter Smoak completed a four point play to cut the Eagles lead to 77-70 with a 1:34 remaining. After failing to convert on its ensuing possession, TFC found the margin cut to 77-73 after Berry\u2019s Mac Whalen drained a three from the wing. After a TFC timeout, the Eagles regrouped and were able to ice the game from the free throw. Berry scored 40 points in the final 9 minutes of play after scoring just 38 points in the previous 31 minutes of action. Despite the Vikings attempt at a monumental comeback, TFC escaped with an 85-78 victory. The win was TFC\u2019s 6th\u00a0win in its last 8 contests., 42270=TFC began the second half with an enthusiasm that was previously lacking in the game. After both teams traded baskets in the early going, TFC\u2019s Jon Sauls tied the game with his second pointer of the night, 33-33. Sauls would hand TFC its first lead of the game with a free throw and an acrobatic layup. Sauls\u2019 six straight points gave TFC a 36-33 lead. Trinity climbed back on top with 8:38 remaining and would grow its lead to 48-44. Juniors Derek Westfall and Josh Barrett combined to convert four consecutive free throw attempts to re-tie the game at 48-48 with less than two minutes remaining. After Trinity scored in the paint and led 50-48, Josh Barrett converted an old fashioned three point play to give TFC the 51-50 lead with 46 seconds remaining. Trinity failed to score on its ensuing position, but TFC would then miss the front end of a 1 and 1. Trinity scared the home crowd with a desperation three pointer that bounced off the rim as the buzzer sounded. In dramatic come-from-behind fashion, TFC improved its region record to 6-2 and have won 8 of its last 11 games., 44580=The price of playing four games in a week\u2019s time took its toll on TFC in the second half. Warren Wilson quickly broke the deadlock and led 37-31 shortly after the restart, and forced TFC to call a timeout to slow WWC\u2019s momentum. With 12:22 left in the game, TFC trailed 47-35 and would go on to fall 83-69 in the end., 96145=The men\u2019s basketball team of TFC welcomed Johnson University on February 9 for a non-conference game and won\u00a076 \u2013 57. The Eagles have won 6 of their last 9 games including a three game win streak., 25035=Saturday\u2019s win over Piedmont was the third NCAA Division III opponent TFC has beaten this season. On January 21, TFC defeated Berry College 85-78. Additionally, the Eagles were victorious over Sewanee University 70-67 on February 4., 118631=The Eagles will host Bob Jones University on Tuesday night in their first home game of the season. The Lady Eagles will tip off against BJU at 5:00, and the men\u2019s game will follow., 67573=As an exhibition game, the loss at Georgia Southern will not affect TFC\u2019s record. TFC will hit the road again on Monday as the Eagles travel to Presbyterian College for a 7:45 PM exhibition game with TFC\u2019s second NCAA D1 opponent. On Tuesday, TFC will square off with Piedmont College at 8:00 PM in Demorest. The Eagles\u2019 first home game of the season will be on Friday against Piedmont International University at 6:00 PM., 100351=TFC will host region foe Trinity College on February 8 at 7:00. On February 9, the Eagles will host Johnson University at 4:00., 30357=Toccoa will return home for its final regular season game\u00a0on February 22\u00a0as the Eagles host Piedmont College. On February 27, Toccoa Falls will return to Florida to compete in the south region tournament hosted by Johnson University (FL). The Eagles are 8-4 in region play and 11-16 overall., 102383=TFC traveled to Florida to face region opponents Trinity College and Florida Christian. The Eagles defeated Trinity College\u00a078 \u2013 41 on the road on January 25, but lost to Florida Christian College 45 \u2013 87 on January 26., 90180=The men\u2019s basketball team at Toccoa Falls College finished their regular season schedule by going 1 \u2013 3 in a busy week. On February 11, the Eagles traveled to Piedmont International University and were victorious 77 \u2013 74. The following day, February 12, TFC traveled to Warren Wilson College and were defeated 60 -47. NCAA Division II North Greenville University defeated TFC 106 \u2013 65 on February 14. In the final regular season game, the Eagles hosted Johnson and Wales University on February 16 and fell to the visitors 61- 58., 93747=TFC finishes the regular season at 8 \u2013 22, and will be the four seed in next week\u2019s region tournament. The tournament will be hosted by Clearwater Christian College in Florida, and will be played on February 21 \u2013 23. As the four seed, the Eagles will play hosts Clearwater Christian College in the 4/5 matchup. TFC recently beat Clearwater 94 \u2013 79, but lost 90 \u2013 111 earlier in the season at Clearwater., 34240=In the second half, TFC never trailed and would hold a lead that grew as large as 54-44 with just over 8 minutes remaining in the game. Just as Sewanee was gaining some moment and tension was growing, TFC\u2019s Clay Martin threw down a powerful two hand slam to ignite the crowd and the Eagles. Martin\u2019s dunk gave TFC a 61-54 lead. Sewanee\u2019s Seth Brown and Jorden Williams combined to hit three consecutive three pointers to close TFC\u2019s gap to 66-63. Josh Barrett hit a tough jumper and Derek Westfall converted two free throws to extend the Eagles lead to 70-63 with 2:04 remaining. Sewanee\u2019s Keshonn Carter scored four consecutive points to narrow TFC\u2019s margin to 70-67 with 55 seconds still to play. TFC buckled down on defense, and the only shot the Eagles would allow over the last minute of action was a last second three point attempt by Sewanee\u2019s Matt Tome. Even though Sewanee had shot 6-9 behind the arc in the second half, Tome\u2019s attempt was long, and the clock expired for TFC\u2019s 5th consecutive victory.
