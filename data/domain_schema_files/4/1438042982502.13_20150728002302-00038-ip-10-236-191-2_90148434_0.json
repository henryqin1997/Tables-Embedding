Engine assemblers should lay the head gasket on the block and the cylinder head (with front of gasket toward the front of the engine) to make sure there is a path for coolant flow from the block into the head. In some cases, holes may have to be drilled in the block or head, or punched in the gasket. specs Package Dimensions: 0.25 x 8.25 x 22 Package Weight: 1 lbs Part Type: Engine: Gaskets Instruction Sheet: Not Available Warranty Availability: Not Available UPC Code: 756122605080 Country of Origin: United States California Executive Order: No",
