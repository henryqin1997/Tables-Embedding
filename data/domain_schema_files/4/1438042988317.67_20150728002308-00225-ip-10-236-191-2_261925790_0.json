But let\u2019s take a look at the other Anderson film. \u2018The Master\u2019 opened on five screens this weekend in limited release (it expands next weekend) and from those five screens, it made $703,000. That\u2019s $146,000 per screen. That\u2019s a limited release record, folks. For comparison\u2019s sake, \u2018Resident Evil: Retribution\u2019 opened on 3,012 screens and made $7,005 per screen. So, which one is the winner of the week: the film that opened at at a slightly flimsy number one because there was nothing to challenge it or the film that opened at number eighteen and sold out each and every one of its locations? \u2018Resident Evil: Retribution\u2019 may top the list, but let\u2019s",
