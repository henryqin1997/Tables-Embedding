K9 Advantix kills and repels fleas, ticks and mosquitoes. What makes K9 Advantix so different is it has permethrin in it. Permethrin will kill and repel just about anything. (It's the same chemical they use to fog dog kennels and horse barns to kill fleas, ticks, flies and practically everything else.) However, we live in an area where ticks are problem, and our dogs have actually had a couple of ticks (either attached or embedded under their skin) while on this product. It does appear that the ticks were shriveled up and dead by the time we spotted them.",

If money is an issue, and/or you've only got a really bad flea problem that you're trying to combat fast, then you might want to try Advantage first.
