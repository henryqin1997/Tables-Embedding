Involved in the clearance of damaged mitochondria via selective autophagy (mitophagy) by mediating activation and translocation of PARK2. Targets PARK2 to dysfunctional depolarized mitochondria through the phosphorylation of MFN2. Activates PARK2 in 2 steps: (1) by mediating phosphorylation at Ser-65 of PARK2 and (2) mediating phosphorylation of ubiquitin, converting PARK2 to its fully-active form (PubMed:24660806, PubMed:24751536, PubMed:24784582, PubMed:25527291)., 263493=This gene encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase that localizes to mitochondria.
