Details and Timing: Implement a re-certification program in Trademarks. USPTO Recommended Course of Action: In order to maintain the core competency and the proficiency of the trademark professionals, the Office should create a series of tests that enable individuals to demonstrate their competencies related to the examination process and their ability to work independently throughout their career at the USPTO.\u00a0 Upon passing a test, the individual will be promoted.\u00a0 The test content and difficulty will be based on the individual\u0092s grade and the job that the individual is performing.\u00a0 For trademark examiners, at the GS-11 and GS-12 level, we would test for legal competencies. \u00a0After the",
