With the end of the war, however, UMWA negotiators renewed their efforts for medical care reform. When negotiations opened in 1945, the UMWA proposed a royalty of 10 cents per ton of coal to be paid to the Union to \"provide for its members modern medical and surgical service, hospitalization, insurance, rehabilitation and economic protection.\", 26812=Note: Pension Fund numbers (1st two rows) as of 9/1/2008; Health benefit numbers (last three rows) as of 6/1/2008. \u00a0, 11247=Because of nationwide concern about health care matters during the Great Depression, President Roosevelt in 1935 appointed a federal Interdepartmental Committee to Coordinate Health and Welfare Activities. He named as chairman of the committee Josephine Roche, who later became neutral trustee and executive director of the UMWA Funds. One of the major activities of the committee was to convene a National Health Conference, at which Dr. Walter Polakov, Director of the UMWA Department of Engineering, called for the establishment of \"group medicine and group hospitalization\" in coal mining communities., 13227=When the National Bituminous Wage Conference convened in early 1946, a health and welfare fund for miners was the union's top priority. The operators again rejected the proposal and miners walked off the job on April 1, 1946. Negotiations under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Labor continued sporadically through April. On May 10, 1946, President Truman summoned John L. Lewis and the operators to the White House. The stalemate appeared to break when the White House announced an agreement in principle on a health and welfare fund., 22781=Medical benefits for retired miners became a sorely disputed issue between labor and management in the 1980s, as companies sought to avoid their obligations to retirees and dump those obligations onto the UMWA Funds. Courts had issued conflicting decisions in the 1980s, holding that retiree health benefits were indeed benefits for life, but allowing employers to evade the obligation to fund those benefits. The issue came to a critical impasse in 1989 during the UMWA-Pittston Company negotiations. Pittston had refused to continue participation in the UMWA Funds, while the union insisted that Pittston had an obligation to the retirees., 18101=The failure to agree on pensions caused the miners to walk out of the mines in March 1948. Recognizing the intractability of the situation, the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Joseph Martin, asked the trustees to meet with him. At that meeting in the Capitol, Speaker Martin suggested Senator Styles Bridges of New Hampshire as a neutral trustee and both sides agreed. Senator Bridges pointed out the delay of almost two years since the Krug Lewis agreement. He proposed to set the retirement age at 62 with 20 years of service. By vote of Lewis and Bridges the resolution was adopted and the long stalemate was Broken. The first pension check was provided to Horace Ainscough of Rock Springs, Wyoming on September 9, 1948., 30614=United Mine Workers of America 18354 Quantico Gateway Drive Suite 200 Triangle, VA 22172 703-291-2400, 19961=The Funds also made great strides in improving overall medical care in coal mining communities, especially in Appalachia where the greatest inadequacies existed. Recognizing the need for modern hospital and clinic facilities, the Funds constructed ten hospitals in Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia. The hospitals, known as Miners Memorial Hospitals, provided intern and residency programs and training for professional and practical nurses. Thus, because of the Funds, young doctors were drawn to areas of the country that were sorely lacking in medical professionals. A 1978 Presidential Coal Commission found that medical care in the coal field communities had greatly improved, not only for miners but for the entire community, as a result of the UMWA Funds. \"Conditions since the Boone Report have changed dramatically, largely because of the miners and their Union--but also because of the Federal Government, State, and coal companies.\" The Commission concluded that \"both union and non-union miners have gained better health care from the systems developed for the UMWA.\", 9052=The UMWA Health and Retirement Funds (the Funds) was created in 1946 in a contract between the United Mine Workers of America and the federal government during a time of government seizure of the mines. The contract was signed in the White House with President Harry Truman witnessing the historic occasion., 24669=Based on the Coal Commission's recommendations, Senator Rockefeller introduced legislation, known as the Coal Act, that was ultimately signed by President Bush in 1992. Under the Coal Act, all companies (including those that had abandoned their retirees) were required to pay for the cost of their retirees. Orphan retirees, or those without a surviving employer, would be paid out of transfers of surplus pension assets and interest from the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Fund.}",

But mostly the success of the Funds is a testament to the men and women of the coal industry, members of the United Mine Workers of America, who made innumerable sacrifices to secure for themselves a part of the American dream. The structure of the UMWA Funds has changed over the years, but the original promise to retired miners is still being kept. Today, the Funds provides health care benefits to approximately 75,000 retired miners and their dependents. It also provides pension benefits to nearly 110,000 retired miners and widows. It has contributed billions of dollars to improve the lives of those who worked in dangerous conditions to provide the nation with energy. And it has helped alleviate untold suffering and mind-numbing poverty. As John L. Lewis said on the twentieth anniversary of the UMWA Funds \"I don't know of anything that runs further into the emotions of a human being than the matter of our Fund, with its security for our people. It is a dream that has come true, long",
