    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{40699=Most commonly available DC voltages range from about 3 VDC to 30 VDC and most commonly available AC voltages are near 115 VAC or 230 VAC. There is no known power manager, power converter or battery charger that accepts all of these ranges of input voltages while simultaneously providing a wide range of programmable constant output voltages e.g., 2 VDC to 30 VDC or constant output currents, e.g., 0.01 ADC to 2 ADC, efficiently, with compact solid-state hardware. There is a need in the industry for a self-contained, multi-featured, robust, universal power manager that has high selectivity resolution for providing a high resolution selectable current output (on the order of 0.01 ADC resolution) for providing a constant high resolution voltage output (on the order of 0.01 VDC resolution) and while accepting a wide range of input voltages with compact solid-state electronics in an easily programmed fashion for performing the multiple desired operations listed above., 61961=In FIG. 4, each of DP1 102 and DP2 104 has two associated resistance strings 150 and an associated switch 125 to select an associated tap point on one of the two resistance chains 150. Three serial inputs 112, and one H/L (High/Low) potentiometer 114 input are used to select one of 1024 tap point positions (two points for each of two potentiometers, with each tap point having 256 possible positions) on a resistance chain. One tap point 122, and its respective position, is selected by the three serial inputs 112 for each of two resistors 150 of DP1 102 and each of two resistors 150' of DP2 104, and one of DP1 102 or DP2 104 is selected by the H/L potentiometer input 114. Routing the selected tap point of the selected one of DP1 102 and DP2 104 through an analog switch 108 (controlled by the H/L potentiometer signal) to ground 120 realizes a single wiper function., 62855=In FIG. 4, each of DP1 102 and DP2 104 consists of two 256 position potentiometers on a single IC substrate. These commercially available IC's allow each of the 256-position potentiometers to be wired in series and include a wiper selection circuit to effectively produce a device with 512 positions. Since the universal power manager application of the present embodiment requires more than 512 positions to adequately provide constant current control, two IC's are wired in series to create a 1024-position potentiometer. Each separate 256 position potentiometer has a separate wiper function or tap point but only one of the four tap points is grounded, so as to yield a single wiper device. The analog switch 108 along with the four digital potentiometer tap points 122 and 2 resultant tap points (one selected from each IC) are all properly controlled by embedded computer programs 26 that modify the microprocessor in order to provide for the single effective tap point (or wiper).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention herein disclosed has been described by means of specific embodiments and applications thereof, numerous modifications and variations could be made thereto by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention set forth in the claims. Software algorithms are incorporated in the microprocessor 24 to convert the microprocessor's crystal oscillator to an elapsed timer clock displaying hours and minutes as shown in display 500 for automated charge and discharge functions. The elapsed timer is also displayed in operations menus for Constant Voltage, Constant Current and Test Load. The elapsed timer assists a user to determine charge delivered when manually charging or discharging a battery. As described above, exemplary displays are shown in FIGS. 6B-E. During operation, as mentioned above, four analog signals are digitized. These four signals can then be displayed. They are \"DC-in\", \"V-out\", \"I-out\", and \"temp\", and represent, respectively, input voltage at the source (i.e., DC input or, when an AC source is used, the DC input generated by the external or internal converter), output voltage at the power output, output current sensed by the current sense circuit, and ambient/surface temperature detected by the temperature sensor. A timer in the microprocessor provides an elapsed time measurement for diagnostic use. Displays The input or output voltage measurement display 700 of the operations screens can also be used for non-precision voltmeter applications within the voltage range of the variable",
