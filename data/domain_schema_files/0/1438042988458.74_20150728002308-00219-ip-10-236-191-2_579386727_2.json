    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{153192=Laboratory spectroscopic studies of the SO+ cation have been undertaken for more than three decades. The first observations were made by Dyke et al. [10] in 1974, who characterized the SO+ ion by vacuum ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). Dyke et al. [10] determined the potential energy curves (PECs) of six electronic states, but failed to locate the origins of the A2\u03a0 and a4\u03a0 due to impurities. Next, Tsuji et al. [11] in 1980 observed the extensive bands from the helium afterglow reaction of SO2 in the 250\u2013540 nm region and assigned these transitions to the SO+(X2\u03a0-A2\u03a0) band system. Shortly after in 1982 [12], they determined the absolute vibrational quantum numbers for the SO+(X2\u03a0-A2\u03a0) emission system by measurement of isotopic shifts between the S16O+ and the S18O+ bands. Cossart et al. [13] in 1983 made the rotational analysis for the first time for the X2\u03a0-A2\u03a0 as well as b4\u2211\u2212-a4\u03a0 band systems of the SO+ cation, and determined some accurate spectroscopic parameters of the four electronic states, X2\u03a0, A2\u03a0, a4\u03a0 and b4\u2211\u2212. In a parallel study, Coxon and Foster [14] in 1984 recorded nine bands of the A2\u03a0\u2192X2\u03a0 band system. Hardwick et al. [15] in the same year recorded 0\u20135, 0\u20136, 1\u20135 and 1\u20136 bands of the A2\u03a0-X2\u03a0 band at high resolution. The corresponding rotational analyses were also made in their work [14,15]. A number of spectroscopic parameters and molecular constants were determined for the two electronic states in these investigations [10\u201315].}",
