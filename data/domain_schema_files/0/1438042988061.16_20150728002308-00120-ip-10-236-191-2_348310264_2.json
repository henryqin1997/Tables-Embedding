Speaking on his icons.com homepage, Hayles highlighted the new additions to Cardiff's squad: 'Cardiff are our visitors this Saturday and they are going to put us to the test. They have brought in some quality players, especially the boys up front Robbie Fowler and Jimmy Flyd Hasselbaink. They are big name players who have been there and done that.' Hayles expects his side to do well however, and pointed to thie attacking line-up as a source of strength for the home side. 'I think we're looking very strong now and up front we have four strikers who are all scoring.' Plymouth are a decent side, and Cardiff are still yet to gel as a new squad. Nevertheless, a peculiar feeling of optimism has been gripping the message board users - nearly all of whom feel a Cardiff victory is likely: Click here to read or leave your prediction for the game!
