Genesee is 17-16 overall and 16-8 in Region III. Both teams are expected to receive playoff bids when the NJCAA Region III tournament field is announced later Sunday. \u00a0 In the opener, sloppy defense cost the Panthers, as Genesee scored three unearned runs in the third inning to take the lead and another three unearned runs in the fifth to put the game away. TC3 was held to just six hits, with Rose Dovi (Cortland HS/Cortland) the only Panther to record multiple hits. Ashley Morey (Owego Free Academy/Owego) doubled for TC3's only extra base hit. \u00a0 In game two, Genesee scored a pair in the third to take the lead. TC3 responded with a single run in the fourth, but Genesee answered with a run in the top of the fifth to make it 3-1. In the bottom of the inning, TC3 scored twice, with Morey and Casey Ebeling (Pearl River HS/Pearl River) driving in the runs. Ebeling's two-out RBI tied the game at 3-3 heading into the sixth. \u00a0 After holding Genesee off the board in the top of the inning, TC3's Amber Harmon (Whitney Point HS/Lisle) reached on her second bunt base hit of the game, and moved to second on a throwing error. After two outs, Bethany Williamson (South Lewis HS/Lyons Falls) came through with a clutch hit, scoring Harmon with what proved to be the game-winning run. Niki Rieman (Lake Shore HS/Derby) completed the win in the seventh, holding Genesee off the board to pick up the victory. \u00a0 Rieman and Harmon were the only Panthers to record multiple hits in game two. Williamson collected two hits on the afternoon, giving her 48 for the season, tying the TC3 season record set by Amber Wallace in 2004. Williamson has 78 hits for her career, one behind Wallace's career record. \u00a0 The NJCAA Region III playoffs will include eight teams with the first round of games Tuesday. \u00a0 Boxscore - Game 1 Boxscore - Game 2, 3860=May 19. 2015, 25714=106 Colleen Bannon (2009-10) 72 Heather Weber (2005-06) 61 Ashley Morey (2007-08), 86755=Thursday, April 12, 2007, 21899=.516 Samijo Scheer (2011-12) .500 Colleen Bannon (2009-10) .492 Brooke Wierzbicki (2009-10), 84691=Friday, April 13, 2007}",
