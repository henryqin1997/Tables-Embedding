This story is far from over, though. \u00a0Multiple sources have reported that Brady is expected to take the decision to court. \u00a0That process could take months. \u00a0And Brady would be able to play while the legal process plays out. \u00a0For now, fantasy owners should continue to assume Brady will miss 4 games at some point this season, but this remains a fluid situation. \u00a0Brady's\u00a0MFL10 ADP has held steady in the early 10th round throughout July. Full Story Jul 28, 2015 Brady suspension could go to court ABC News' Ryan Smith hears that the NFLPA is prepared to go to court if Patriots QB Tom Brady's appeal results in a suspension for any games. \u00a0Brady is currently looking at a 4-game ban, and the odds of that being wiped down to 0 seem slim. \u00a0If the situation is taken to court, it could become a long process. \u00a0And it's possible that Brady is allowed to play while the legal process plays out. \u00a0We'll continue to keep a close eye on this story. \u00a0Brady's\u00a0ADP is sitting in the early 10th round as the 10th QB off the board in recent MFL10 drafts.
