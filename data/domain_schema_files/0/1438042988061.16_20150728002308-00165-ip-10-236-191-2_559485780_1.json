Grayson led his side to the fourth round last season, in a cup run that saw his side beat Manchester United in the third round at Old Trafford 1-0. They eventually lost out to Tottenham in the fourth road after firstly holding them to a 2-2 draw at White Hart Lane and is sure his players will once again be up for the challenge. Speaking on the official website after the draw was made, Grayson said, \"After knocking out Manchester United in the third round last season and taking Tottenham to a replay in the fourth round, the current crop at Leeds have shown they relish the big occasion.\" It will be the first time the two clubs have met in the competition since meeting at the same stage in 2004 at Elland Road when Arsenal won 4-1. The two sides both have a great tradition of great clashes in the cup, including Leeds only triumph in the competition when a solitary Allan Clarke goal was enough for Leeds to bring the trophy home to Yorkshire in 1972. It will be the first time the two sides will have met at The Emirates, the last time the two clubs met in the competition at Highbury Leeds won through to the fifth round thanks to a solitary Rod Wallace goal. They have previously met in the competition on six other occasions with Leeds winning two and Arsenal four. There have also been six replays, the most memorable being the epic ties in 1982/83 when it went to a third game and the clash in 1990/91 going to four games with Arsenal eventually winning through in both ties. Leeds fans will be looking forward to hearing ticket arrangements for the tie as its another chance to take a huge vociferous following away from home.
