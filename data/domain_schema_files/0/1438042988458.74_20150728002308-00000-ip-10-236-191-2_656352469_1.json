I have opinions on everything, and can be quite sarcastic. I use my witty humour to ensure that everyone around me has a good time....but know when to stop and be serious. As the title says, I am just a plain and simple guy. I work in a profession that I enjoy and makes me happy, I workout, I play sports, and I hang out with my friends. I have been on this site from time to time but never really took it seriously as still I am still skeptical. Overall, I just a normal person going through this world called life. If would be nice to meet people, converse and have fun. I can have a great conversation about anything, but can be a bit stubborn about my opinions, while still valuing yours. But enough about me...feel free to msg me! First Date",
