Smartbench 2012 is a multi-core friendly benchmark application that includes both the Productivity and Gaming indices for a more complete gauge of the overall performance of Android tablets. Quadrant evaluates the CPU, memory, I/O and 3D graphics performance. This is an Android OS based test. The following benchmarks were used for raw performance evaluation: We will be pitting the Tablet Z up against a few of the most popular 10-inch choices out there, including Apple's iPad (4th Gen), Samsung's Galaxy Note 10.1, and Toshiba's\u00a0Regza Tablet AT300. We'll also see how it fares against Sony's previous tablet, the Xperia Tablet S. The Sony Xperia Tablet Z is one of the first tablets on the market to use Qualcomm\u2019s 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro processor with 2GB of RAM making it one of the more powerful tablets currently available.
