    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{40050=Chip 19 is electrically connected to the flexible substrate's signal lines 23 at the illustrated, respective contact sites 21. Such connection is to a small projecting portion of the signal line 23 which projects from beyond the internal edge 28 of the dielectric layer 29. Each projecting portion of lines 23 thus forms a projecting lead portion 31. In FIG. 1, no strain relief exists between chip 19 and the flexible substrate 15, due to the direct physical bond (connection) at contact site 21. The bond at site 21 is typically rapidly formed using a known thermal compression process with a known hot bonding apparatus 33 (e.g., as depicted in FIG. 2). Such a procedure normally only takes about one second, including connection of all sites simultaneously in this manner. In one example, a total of 647 sites have been bonded. During this procedure, the bulk (larger, remaining portion) of the substrate and the metal stiffener remain at or near room temperature. Subsequent heating of the entire package 11 may thus bring about high tensile stresses in the portion of the substrate 15 located immediately below the gap between the stiffener member 13 and chip 19, due primarily to the higher CTE of both the stiffener 13 and substrate 15 compared to that of the chip 19 (typically by a magnitude of about 5:1 to 7:1). Because of the lack of acceptable strain relief between chip 19 and substrate 15, a detrimental condition known as \"wrinkling\" may occur to the flexible circuitized substrate 15 due to these high tensile stresses. This wrinkled condition can even delaminate substrate 15 from adhesive 17, and also prevent successful utilization of external conductive elements 25 to form an electrical connection to external conductive elements, e.g., conductive pads, on a circuit board. (The pads (26) are only shown in FIG. 7 of the drawings, and are understood to lie on a circuitized substrate such as a printed circuit board 26' located below the embodiments in the drawings such that elements 25 each physically engage a respective pad to form a connection thereto. None of the other parts shown in the drawings physically engage the board in the final version of the invention.), 39481=Typical materials used in flexible circuitized substrate 15 include copper (or copper alloy) for the signal lines 23 and any associated ground plane 27 (if used), and polyimide for the flexible substrate's dielectric layer 29. Stiffener member 13 is typically copper or aluminum. Conductive elements 25 can be either high-melt (e.g., 90:10 which is 90 percent lead and 10 percent tin) solder or lower melting point (e.g., 37:63) solder. Adhesive 17 is typically a soft elastomeric film, and may be selected from several known adhesives in the field., 20463=This application is a divisional of U.S. Ser. No. 08/595,108, filed Feb. 1, 1996, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,760,465.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes While there have been shown and described what are at present considered the preferred embodiments of the invention, it is understood that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Thus there has been shown and described an improved electronic package in which strain relief means are provided to substantially prevent adverse conditions such as tape \"wrinkling\" should excessive CTE differentials exist. The modifications are readily possible using many known processes and thus do not significantly increase the final cost of the finished product. In FIG. 7, the improved electronic package is further enhanced by including a tab portion 71 along the outer peripheral portion of stiffener 13'. This tab is shown interlocking with a corresponding slot 73 formed in heatsink 61. The improvement of stiffener 13' over stiffener 13 (as depicted in previous figures) by including tab portion 71 provides added positive retention of the heatsink to the rest of the electronic package, providing further stress relief to the thermal adhesives 65 and 67 (useful prior to curing of the adhesives), which can be particularly important if a relatively heavy heatsink 61 is utilized. Tab portion 71 can be of two types: permanently deformable or spring-locking; the choice primarily being economic. It has been found that using an extension of the stiffener, formed by stamping it approximately 10 mils thick",
