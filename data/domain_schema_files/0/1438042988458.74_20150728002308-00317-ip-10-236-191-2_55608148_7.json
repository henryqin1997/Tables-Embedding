New Orleans set an NFL mark for most yards allowed in a single season with 7,042, shattering the previous mark of 6,793 set by the 1981 Baltimore Colts., 77841=Cam Newton battled through a leg injury in the fourth quarter and threw for 248 yards with an interception in the victory. The Panthers rebounded nicely after a 1-6 start, with their lone victory in that stretch coming in Week 2 against a Saints team that had its own problems throughout an up-and-down 2012., 78400=New Orleans (7-9) had a chance to finish at .500 after a disastrous 0-4 start that followed numerous off-field issues, but instead wound up with a losing record for the first time since 2007., 80535=Brees tried to rally the Saints, throwing TD passes of nine yards to Marques Colston and 33 yards to Darren Sproles around a 42-yard Graham Gano field goal. The Sproles touchdown pulled New Orleans within six with 2:52 to play, but the Saints failed to recover the ensuing onsides kick., 80834=Carolina, thanks to an 11-yard run from Williams and 10 more on three carries by Tolbert, chewed up the remaining time to complete a sweep of New Orleans for the first time since 2008.}",
