    "textBeforeTable": "Patentzitate It should be understood that many substitutions or modifications can be made by those skilled in the art, without departing from the scope and spirit of the appended claims. Although, in the above-described embodiments, the power source applies positive voltage to the apparatus, negative voltage is also applicable. In this structure, abrupt transition of electric current feeding can be further restricted during insertion of the peripheral unit. This embodiment is more advantageous than the third embodiment, in that it does not need a large value of capacitance for each capacitor. In the third embodiment, a capacitor having a large capacitance was used for C2 for the purpose of increasing the time constant for insertion, while maintaining the time constant for extraction. The size of the capacitor tends to be in proportion to the capacitance thereof, the sixth embodiment is superior to the third one. When the short terminal pair is disconnected, the drain of the second FET 12 is in the state almost equal to the open state, and the second delay circuit is isolated. The time constant for the extraction is represented as C1*R1. [2] Extraction of the Peripheral Unit When the peripheral unit is in the completely inserted state where both long and short terminal pairs are connected, electric current flows through R5 and R7 in the second delay circuit to charge the capacitor C2, and the gate voltage of the second FET 12 gradually",
