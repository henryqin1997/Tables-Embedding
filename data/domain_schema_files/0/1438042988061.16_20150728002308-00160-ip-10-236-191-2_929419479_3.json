The rankings, combined with those of the four previous campaigns, determine the number of places allocated to each association (country) in the forthcoming UEFA club competitions. Points system 1. Each team gets two points for a win and one point for a draw (points are halved for matches in the qualifying and play-off rounds). 2. Clubs that reach the round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals or final of the UEFA Champions League, or the quarter-finals, semi-finals or final of the UEFA Europa League, are awarded an extra point for each round. 3. In addition, four points are awarded for participation in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League and an extra four points for qualifying for the round of 16. Coefficient calculation The coefficient is calculated by working out an average score: dividing the total number of points obtained, by the total number of clubs representing an association in that season\u2019s two club competitions. These rankings will be updated after each round of UEFA",
