Further details are set out in applicants' U.S. provisional patent application, Serial No. 60/130,368, filed on Apr. 21, 1999, and entitled \u201cTRACKING SYSTEM FOR GAME OF CHANCE.\u201d, 120995=In step 722, the DSP CPU 162 determines if the item 41 is from the 1996 or later series. If the item 41 is from a series before the 1996 series, the DSP CPU 162 stops testing, concludes the item 41 is valid, and passes control to step 724 identifying the item 41 as valid. If the item 41 is from the 1996 series, or a later series, the reader continues testing, examining the micro-print on the item in step 726. Micro-print is a security feature added in the 1996 series to foil forgery using high quality color copiers. If the DSP CPU 160 determines that the microprint is invalid, control passes to step 718 indicating that the item 41 is invalid. If valid, the DSP CPU 162 examines the item 41 for a security thread or security band in step 728. The security thread or band is a thin strip incorporate in the U.S. currency. If the DSP CPU 162 determines that the security band is invalid, control again passes to the step 718 indicating the item 41 as invalid, otherwise the item 41 is considered valid and control passes to step 724 indicating that the item 41 is valid. The DSP CPU 160 can examine other security features as desired, such as a watermark., 41981=This application claims the benefit of Provisional Application No. 60/130,368, filed on Apr. 21, 1999, which application is incorporated herein in its entirety.}",
