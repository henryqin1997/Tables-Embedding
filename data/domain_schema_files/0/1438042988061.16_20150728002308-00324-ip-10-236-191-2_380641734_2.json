Although some clubs will argue that emergency loans allow them to better balance the books by reducing on permanent squad numbers, others have commented that it will give younger players more of a chance of first-team football. Middlesbrough manager Tony Mowbray for instance told BBC Sport: 'Clubs are going to start looking at their youth systems. If they can't loan a player when they get injuries and suspensions, maybe they have to dig deep into their own resources.' Partly through good intentions and partly through financial necessity, Sky Blues manager Andy Thorn has largely eschewed the emergency loan system this season, preferring instead to blood youngsters such as Cyrus Christie and Gael Bigirimana. Christie in particular has been a shining light in a dismal season but who knows whether the right signing at the right time would have given Thorn`s side a real kickstart.
