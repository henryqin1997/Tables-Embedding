The dense lush string arrangements by Wally Stott seemed to evoke a Vegas-style lounge crooner atmosphere, but one tinted with surreal drones and touches of dissonance., 7624=A cover of \"30 Century Man\" by the Jigsaw Seen was used in the animated film Futurama: Bender's Big Score. Marc Almond covered the song \"Big Louise\" in 1982 with his band Marc and the Mambas on the album Untitled., 7039=Since its release, it has been regarded by many of Walker's fans as a favourite. The title of the compilation Fire Escape in the Sky: The Godlike Genius of Scott Walker is taken from the lyrics of the song \"Big Louise\", and the 2006 documentary Scott Walker: 30 Century Man is named after \"30 Century Man\".}",
