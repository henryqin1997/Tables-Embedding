    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{175105=In the version of the MVP award that existed in the AL from 1922-28, prior award winners were ineligible, so after winning it in 1923 Ruth was ineligible for the next several years., 158481=Looks like our new earliest game with two living players is July 2, 1940 with Athletics\u2019 pitcher Carl Miles (making his second and final career appearance) facing Bobby Doerr and the Red Sox in a 15-9 Boston win., 152011=For the period 2011-2013, the Tigers have both the top WAR everyday player (Cabrera just ahead of Cano, 22.1 to 21.5) and the top WAR pitcher (Verlander just barely ahead of Kershaw, 20.8 to 20.6). Over that three-year period, Detroit has the fourth-best regular season winning percentage: 1. Rangers 280-207 (.575) 2. Braves 279-207 (.574) 3. Yankees 277-209 (.570) 4. Tigers 276-210 (.568) 5. Cardinals 275-211 (.566), 138929=I\u2019d probably rate Cabrera amongst the Top Ten RIGHT-HANDED hitters ever. Here\u2019s the best right-handed hitters since 1900, listed chronologically (my Top-Dozen in CAPS):, 165963=Now, maybe if Piazza had transitioned to first earlier on he would have succeeded there (and maybe done a little better at the plate), BUT his Rfield and his Rpos net out to a positive 19 runs for his actual career. I doubt they would do that if he played first. Keith Hernandez, who might be the best defensive first baseman ever, nets out as +8 runs (117 Rfield, -109 Rpos). Mark Grace, who was a really good defensive first baseman, nets out at -43. Frank Thomas, through 1997 (the last year he played first full time), is at -126 Rfield+Rpos. So Piazza would have had to have a huge increase in offensive performance (in my opinion) to actually have been more valuable as a first baseman., 155180=The eight other 500/500 guys at first and third: Killebrew, Rose, Torre, Dick Allen, Tony Perez, Darrell Evans, Enos Cabell and Dave Magadan (Magadan being one of my all-time personal favorite players for some reason). Seven of these eight guys, all but Magadan, were active in the majors during the 1972 season, and the 1973 season, and the 1974 season and the 1975 season. Roberta Flack on the radio and 1B/3B guys in the majors., 160762=Doerr and George Yankowski appeared in the same game on 8-22-42., 159350=Earliest post-season game with two still-living players appears to be game 1 of the 1946 Series, with Doerr, Red Schoendienst and Joe Garagiola. Lennie Merullo and Ed Mierkowicz appeared in different games of the 1945 series., 127074=Guerrero: 1603 G, 49.5 WAR Cabrera: 1660 G, 54.6 WAR, 158939=Next would be Fred Caligiuri and Chuck Stevens, who both appeared in the Sep 14-16, 1941 Browns/Athletics series, though not in the same game (Caligiuri and Doerr also appeared in different games of the season-ending Athletics/Red Sox series). By 1942, there are several still-living players who were active in the AL. But, looks like the earliest NL game with two living players is in 1943., 129163=Through age 30, Cabrera ranks only 35th in WAR among post-1901 players. Even if you were to \u201coverlook\u201d his -12.2 dWAR and just compared his oWAR (62.4) to the other players\u2019 total WAR, that would only move him up to 26th spot, just behind Al Kaline and Yaz., 156756=Don\u2019t know where to put this so I\u2019ll do it here if you don\u2019t mind Doug. With the recent passing of Mike Palagyi, Bobby Doerr and Art Kenney are the only 2 still living players who played in the 1930s. Palagyi played in one ML game on 8-18-39. Doerr also was in that game and it had currently been the furthest back in time that 2 still living players had faced each other. I also saw that Lou Brissie also just passed away. He made it to the ML despite playing with a rebuilt leg due to a serious WWII injury., 146547=Are you sure you didn\u2019t scan the Rbat list? Going back to 1890 (to capture all of Wagner\u2019s and Lajoie\u2019s careers) there are only 28 right-handed batters with 400+ career Rbat., 146743=Al Simmons (388), Ralph Kiner (369), and Roberto Clemente (373) don\u2019t make the list but they are close. You have 25 players, minus Mize and those 3, so 21 of those players have over 400 Rbat. Throw in Cabrera and there are 22 of the 28 players, and the 1890 cutoff gets us Ed Delahanty (who wouldn\u2019t have been on your list) so that\u2019s 23 of 28 players.}",
