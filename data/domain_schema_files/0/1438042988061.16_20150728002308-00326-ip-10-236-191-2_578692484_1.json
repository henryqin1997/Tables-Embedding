The 23-year-old defender is playing for Lokomotiv Moscow and plays alongside Vidic (who had been signed from Moscow, by the way) in the Serbia team. Italian Juventus are interested in him but Tuttosport (not very credible source, mind you) reported that Vidic took on the role of a scout or player agent and recommended his team-mate to Sir Alex. Why would we sign another central defender is beyond me but this rumour seems to have more solid foundations than the one about Barcelona wonderkid Giovanni Dos Santos. It's been said in the press that Barcelona are concerned they'll lose the player whose agent Pini Zahavi did not deny Dos Santos would attract many suitors from all around the world. \"Until then I will not speak to anyone about him. There has been no contact with English clubs. But obviously Giovani is a diamond of world football. He has a contract until 2008 but he signed when he was under 18, so you can look at that how you wish.\" Yet another stupid rumour. We bought Anderson, another Ronaldinho-successor and bought Nani - I'd prepared to risk something valuable and bet we won't buy another skillful attacking midfielder. It will be a striker or a right-back if Fergie decides to strengthen in January., 14795=Young Set to Sign New Old Trafford Deal (Thursday July 30 2015), 14583=Where`s Our Missing Angel?
