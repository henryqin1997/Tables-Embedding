Matinees have been a tradition since 2003., 50842=Friday, April 25, 2014 5:28pm, 54136=Pacing nearby, a shaggy-haired man checked his watch as time ticked past 11:30 a.m. and the track had yet to open. Frustrated, he slapped a program against his leg. Another regular, clutching a frayed clipboard that held his race notes, reminisced with a security guard about how long the lines stretched decades ago., 55107=Since 2007, the St. Petersburg Kennel Club has reported dog track losses of more than $20 million, including $3.2 million last year alone. In fact, not a single Florida parimutuel posted an operating profit from dog racing in its most recent state financial filing., 56693=It was a morning for postcards: sunny and dead-on 70 degrees. The air smelled of coffee and chili and hot dogs. Over the pops of cigarette packs slapping palms, Barenaked Ladies' 1998 hit One Week (among the most current offerings all day) squawked overhead., 53106=This photo from May 8, 1987 \u2014 a Thursday \u2014 shows a crowd of 9,881 on hand for the season\u2019s final night of dog racing at Derby Lane. Track officials had projected a season attendance of 990,000, the first time in the track\u2019s history it would fail to attract over 1 million attendees., 54799=Inside, the patrons spread thin across a stadium that once held 12,000 people. Racing since 1925, Derby bills itself as the world's oldest continuously operating greyhound track. To those who care, it is an iconic site, the Lambeau Field of its sport. But those who care grow fewer every year., 71216=Derby Lane: Love for a dying sport 04/25/14 [Last modified: Saturday, April 26, 2014 8:56pm] Photo reprints | Article reprints}",
    "textBeforeTable": "The Tampa Bay Times recently obtained financial records for the Florida businesses permitted to hold greyhound races. The Times found \u2014 in their most recent state filings \u2014 not one of the permit holders posted a positive operating income from its parimutuel activities, although several made up for those losses with robust profits from card rooms or slot machines (some permit-holder totals have been consolidated under their parent company). Losing at the track Times artist Don Morris contributed to this report. It was 11 p.m. on a Wednesday. Inside, chips clacked and cards snapped. About 70 players sat around the poker room's tables. They wore sunglasses and checked their smartphones between hands. They sipped energy drinks and pumped their fists at wins. As the last few walked out, on the far west side of the concession stand, light filtered through a glass door. \"So long everybody,\" the announcer said, \"from St. Petersburg.\" A man swept stray tickets and cigarette butts as a waitress bagged leftover popcorn for the security guards. The windblown buntings were twisted tangles around the fence. When the day's 30th and last race ended, a family from Michigan took a photo beneath the aqua-neon greyhound before it was shut off. The staff included a bartender, a tractor driver, a sweeper, a cameraman, an announcer, two waitresses, two cooks, two security guards, at least seven cashiers and nearly 20 dog handlers, a total that appeared to outnumber the fans. Still, more",
