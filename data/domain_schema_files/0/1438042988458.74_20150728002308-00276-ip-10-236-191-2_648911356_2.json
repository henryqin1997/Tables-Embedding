    "textBeforeTable": "\u00a0 Top 200 Products of 2012 by Total Dollars The decline in prescription drug sales may be the product of drug therapy optimization and streamlining, which would ultimately lead to improved outcomes. Alternatively, this decline may also reflect a tendency for some patients to defer health care costs and preventive treatments, leading to more advanced complications and ultimately higher health care costs. Changes in health care coverage may benefit the majority of patients using low-cost generics for the most commonly treated disease states, but there will likely continue to be a small segment of patients facing large out-of-pocket expenses for specialty medications treating specific conditions. It is likely that growing availability of new agents and treatment options for a number of diseases will continue into the next few years. The 2012 FDA Safety and Innovation Act included a provision for the designation of Breakthrough Therapies, which can lessen the burden of the development and review processes for some new medications aimed at treating serious diseases. Additionally, there are several highly anticipated agents on the horizon that have been approved or that are expected to gain FDA approval in 2013. Kadcyla (ado-trastuzumab emtansine) was approved in February 2013 and has been called the \u201csmart bomb\u201d for breast cancer. Invokana (canagliflozin) is the first agent approved in a new class of agents targeting type 2 diabetes. Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) is a newly approved oral agent targeting multiple sclerosis.",
