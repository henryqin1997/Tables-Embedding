[edit] Double Check! Prioritizing is good. We're especially interested in problems that result in an unuseable desktop. Let's keep track of them. [edit] Is it a big bug? If something has no clear instructions on how to reproduce it, or has little useful information, add a comment asking the reporter for more detail. Then list it in the bugs awaiting feedback section. Be polite, we want to be nice to our bug reporters! [edit] Unclear Some bugs might have documents that expose the bugs attached, for some bugs you might be able to create data that shows the buggy behaviour. In both cases we have to add the testcase keyword. If you lack permissions to do so, additionally add the bug to the \"Needs testcase keyword\" section. [edit] Testcases If you're done with your batch, pick another one and start from the top\u00a0:-) Mark the bug as triaged by adding the triaged keyword",
