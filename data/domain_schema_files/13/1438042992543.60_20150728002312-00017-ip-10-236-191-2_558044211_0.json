    "textAfterTable": "Cyanine5.5 NHS ester is a reactive dye for the labeling of amino-groups in peptides, proteins, and oligonucleotides, an analog of Cy5.5\u00ae NHS ester. Cy5.5 is a far-red (and near-infrared) emitting dye which is ideal for fluorescence measurements where background fluorescence is a concern. It is also suitable for in vivo NIR imaging experiments. This reagent can replace NHS esters of Cy5.5\u00ae, Alexa Fluor 680, and DyLight 680.
