TC4 Trust, which has since folded, and Freedom Partners, which remains on top of the Koch pyramid, shelled out more than $204 million to the network\u2019s 10 other nonprofits. But instead of giving the money directly to the nonprofits, TC4 and Freedom Partners gave those millions to the groups\u2019 disregarded entities., 34476=Their use might be catching on: In July 2012, the American Future Fund, a dark money behemoth that received most of its money through the Koch network but is not part of it,\u00a0formed\u00a0its own disregarded entity, Franklin Squared., 22513=The first such LLC sprang up in February 2010, when Sean Noble, the head of a Koch network nonprofit called the Center to Protect Patient Rights,\u00a0formed SDN LLC, using the initials of his own name. (ProPublica\u00a0wrote a story last month about Noble, the Koch network\u2019s money man in 2010 and 2012.), 27432=Koch network groups came to have a total of 19 disregarded entities, tax records show; Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, a trade association that distributed almost $236 million to other nonprofits in the year before the 2012 election,\u00a0led the way with five., 19431=After a top Cato official ridiculed Charles Koch in\u00a0a 2010 New Yorker article, the brothers pushed to put allies on the think tank\u2019s board. The following year, they\u00a0pressed Cato to provide \u201cintellectual ammunition\u201d\u00a0for their oldest politically active nonprofit, Americans for Prosperity, Cato officials later alleged. The dispute was\u00a0settled in 2012, with the departure of Crane and the installation of a traditional board.

And it\u00a0showed the group\u2019s disregarded entity: TOHE. Concerned Veterans spent most of its money on ads criticizing the government for not doing more to help\u00a0veterans vote\u00a0and for the rising\u00a0national debt. \u00a0, 22313=As of 2012,all 12 Koch network groups had offshoots known as \u201cdisregarded entities\u201d \u2014 LLCs that are \u201cowned\u201d by their parent nonprofits and are considered part of them for tax purposes., 35132=But nine of the 12 nonprofits in the Koch network were formed as trusts \u2014 an approach several tax experts said they had rarely, if ever, encountered. The first was TC4 Trust, which was established in August 2009 and folded in 2012. Eight more Koch-affiliated groups were set up as trusts in 2010 and 2011., 29476=Consider the case of the LLC with the inscrutable name of TOHE. (No, that\u2019s not a typo.) Records for TC4 Trust show that it\u00a0gave a $1,968,500 grant to TOHE\u00a0between July 2011 and June 2012., 37357=Little else is known about these LLCs except that they, too, were formed by Graber in 2010 and 2011 in Delaware, a state that requires virtually no disclosure., 33634=Seven disregarded entities in the Koch network took in more than three-quarters of the money received by their parent nonprofits. POFN,\u00a0the disregarded entity of a nonprofit called Public Notice, for instance, brought in more than 75 percent of its parent\u2019s $6 million in revenue from May 2011 through April 2012. POFN\u2019s manager \u2014 whoever that may be \u2014 would control how that money was spent, nonprofit experts said., 21055=In this story, we define the Koch network as including 12 nonprofits active in 2012 \u2014 11 social welfare nonprofits and one trade association. These nonprofits all shared the same attributes: They used LLCs, installed Koch allies at the helm and hired the same set of lawyers. (We did not include think tanks, foundations or other charities, nor the like-minded groups that are funded by the Kochs.), 34181=So far, the Koch network\u2019s use of disregarded entities has been unique. ProPublica reviewed tax returns filed by more than 100 liberal and conservative nonprofits that reported spending money on elections in 2010 and 2012. No group unaffiliated with the Kochs had such offshoots., 18003=A review of 2012 tax returns filed by Koch network groups shows that most have been set up as nonprofit trusts rather than not-for-profit corporations, an unusual step that reduces their public reporting requirements.}",

When asked about his involvement with Americans for Prosperity in\u00a0a rare interview with the Wichita Business Journal\u00a0last month, Charles Koch downplayed his political activity, saying he and his brother did not have day-to-day involvement with the group. Officials with Koch Industries and groups in the Koch network did not respond to calls or written questions from ProPublica.

Koch network groups came to have a total of 19 disregarded entities, tax records show; Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, a trade association that distributed almost $236 million to other nonprofits in the year before the 2012 election,\u00a0led the way with five. Unlike corporations, LLCs set up in Delaware are not required to disclose who runs them. The only documentation available is the name of the person who creates them. In the Koch network, 11 of the disregarded entities were formed by the same Chicago trust lawyer,\u00a0Jonathan Graber. Most had nonsensical strings of letters for names, like\u00a0SLAH,\u00a0ORRA\u00a0or\u00a0DAS MGR. All were set up in Delaware. Charities typically use disregarded entities to protect themselves from liability. For instance, they\u2019ll hold property in a disregarded entity to shield the nonprofit from lawsuits over anything from environmental pollution to slip-and-falls. But these LLCs appear to serve different purposes for the Koch network, experts said. Before the 2012 election, two groups sat at the top of the Koch money spigot.
