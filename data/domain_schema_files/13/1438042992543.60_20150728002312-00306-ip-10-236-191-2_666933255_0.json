First is Desecration: If worshipping a god, you can smash up another god's altar to gain 25 piety and immunity from the next \"major punishment\" you would receive; in turn, however, the god whose altar you desecrated will punish you as if you had been a follower but reached 0 piety. Second, you can convert from any god to any other god, at any time, at the cost of half your piety (you must have at least 50 piety to do so). The exception is, naturally, if you destroyed an altar, in which case you can't damn well worship there, can you? Sometimes you can really be quite daft. In addition, no altars will spawn at the beginning of the game. Occasionally, the player will find a subdungeon with a particular challenge; this challenge, when conquered, will convert the player to the god they just discovered (even if they were already worshipping another one) and allow this god's altars to spawn in any dungeon. Generally, 3 altars will spawn per dungeon (assuming at least 3 gods have been discovered). Gods work much the same way in the beta version, but all the gods that are implemented have their boons and piety actions changed up, making them in some cases just slightly different (e.g. Tikki Tooki) and in others encouraging an almost entirely different playstyle than before (e.g. Mystera Annur). Some boons can even be used more than",
