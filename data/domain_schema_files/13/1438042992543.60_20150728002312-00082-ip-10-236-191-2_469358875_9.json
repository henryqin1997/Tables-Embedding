Made the first and only start of his career thus far versus Southern Utah (10/27/12) and finished with three tackles and half-sack. He played a big role in Eastern\u2019s unconventional, 27-24 come-from-behind victory over second-ranked Montana State (10/13/12) to earn team special teams player of the week honors. The Bobcats out-gained EWU 375-211, but EWU managed to take the lead for good on a blocked punt by Zylstra that was recovered for a touchdown by Evan Day. Just 59 seconds later, an interception by Jordan Tonani was returned 21 yards for a touchdown to give EWU a 10-point advantage it didn\u2019t surrender. He had a season-high six tackles against Cal Poly (11/3/12) and one game later had four versus UC Davis (11/10/12). In the spring, he was selected as Eastern\u2019s co-most improved defensive player. Zylstra and teammate Ashton Boothroyd were recognized by EWU and the Big Sky Conference for their role in rescuing a kayaker, who had fallen into Long Lake, northwest of Spokane, Wash., on May 31, 2012. The two were fishing when they saw the man struggling, and yelling for help. They were able to borrow a row boat and Zylstra pulled the man from the frigid waters., 220154=Fax: (509) 359-2828, 33888=2011, 220067=Cheney, WA 99004-2476, 31796=HS: Graduated from Kentridge HS in 2010.

Was selected to the Seattle Times \u201cStar Times\u201d All-Area team as a defensive end/linebacker. He was the South Puget Sound League North Division Defensive Back of the Year and earned first team all-league honors as a linebacker. He had 67 tackles as a senior with 5 1/2 sacks, 13 1/2 total tackles for loss, four blocked kicks and two passes broken up. He helped Kentridge to a 6-4 record overall, including a 6-2 league mark.

He helped lead Kentridge to third place in the 2009 State 4A Tournament and a final record of 20-9., 220117=Phone: (509) 359-2463, 34468=2012, 31354=2011: Zylstra played sparingly as a redshirt freshman in 2011, but finished with 11 tackles and a quarterback hurry. Seven of his tackles came versus Portland State (10/29/11).}",
