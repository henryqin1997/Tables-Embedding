    "textBeforeTable": "Patentzitate In the embodiments described above with reference to FIGS. 12 and 13, the structure of the beam deflectors is that described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 11. However, it is also possible to provide the optical switching systems shown in FIGS. 12 and 13 with beam deflectors, each comprising a mirror which is mechanically pivotable in respect of a mirror support. Such beam deflectors can be manufactured in miniaturized form and are described, for example, in the article of James A. Walter \u201cThe future of MEMS in telecommunications networks\u201d, Journal Michromech. Microeng. 10 (200) R1-R7/PII: S0960-1317(00)06735-8. FIG. 14 schematically shows a beam deflector 1 c provided as so-called MEM mirror. A circular mirror surface 103 is punched out of a plate material 101, with pairs of hinges 105 and 106 which are diametrically opposed in respect of the mirror surface respectively supporting the mirror surface 103 cardanically relative to the remaining plate material 101. Below the mirror surface 103, there are provided four sectors of drive electrodes 109 on an electrode support 111 spaced apart from the rear side of the mirror by a little distance, said electrode support being fixedly connected to the plate material holding the mirror surface 103. By applying appropriately dimensioned electric voltages to the sector electrodes 109, an electrostatic field is produced between the mirror 103 and the electrodes, said field imparting mechanical shift forces on the mirror surface 103 so",
