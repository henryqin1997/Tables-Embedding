Top Score: Rumer Willis & Valentin Chmerkovskiy - 80 points (Rumba 40 pts., Paso Doble 40 pts.) It was all up to the fans as\u00a0Dancing with the Stars\u00a0season 20 celebrated America's Choice Night\u00a0as each of the six remaining couples had to use a song and dance style chosen by fans on Twitter. Then, everyone had to pick an eliminated pro or member of the dance troupe to team up with for a Trio Dance. While the added pressure brought out the best in some of the competitiors, others crumbled and at the end of the night it was not one, but two couples that were eliminated. Once again, our hosts\u00a0Tom Bergeron\u00a0and\u00a0Erin Andrews\u00a0welcomed us back to the ballroom and judges\u00a0Carrie Ann Inaba,\u00a0Len Goodman,\u00a0Julianne Hough\u00a0and\u00a0Bruno Tonioli\u00a0were on-hand to critique the performances. And by the end of the Week 8 Results show, it was time to say goodbye to Bachelor Chris Soules and Shark Tank's Robert Herjavec.",
