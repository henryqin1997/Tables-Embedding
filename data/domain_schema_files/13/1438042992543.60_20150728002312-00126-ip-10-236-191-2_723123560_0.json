    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{32675=The stock-purchase agreement signed by the Koch siblings called for the company to purchase the shares within 180 days after Will Koch\u2019s death, or Dec. 10, 2010. If the purchase wasn\u2019t completed by that date, Dan Koch was supposed to make the purchase himself within 30 days, with a down payment of 25 percent and the balance paid over three years., 38160=Dan Koch announced last fall that the park would invest $6.5 million in improvements and upgrades for the parks\u2019 2013 seasons. It was unclear if the ongoing legal battle had affected those plans., 37062=\u201cHoliday World & Splashin\u2019 Safari have been owned and operated by the Koch family of Santa Claus, Indiana, since the park opened as Santa Claus Land in 1946. Following the death of park Chief Executive Officer and President Will Koch in 2010, questions involving the interpretation of the company\u2019s shareholders agreement arose. Koch family members turned the issue over to the court system,\u201d the statement said., 46584=Copyright \u00a9 2015, 33040=The estate\u2019s suit claimed that Koch Development failed to abide by the agreement to pay the full amount owed for the shares. Instead, Koch Development Co. presented the estate a check for $5 million Dec. 7, 2010. On the same day, Dan Koch presented a check for $4.7 million and a promissory note for $14.1 million., 32101=An agreement signed in 2002 by Will and Dan Koch and their sister, Natalie Koch, stipulated that upon the death of any partner in the company, the holding company would purchase the deceased family member\u2019s shares. At the time, each sibling owned equal shares of the company., 36229=The estate argued in court that the alleged deficient payment constituted a breach of the agreement signed by the Koch siblings. Attorneys for the two sides presented evidence during a three-day trial in late November and early December. Heldt issued his ruling Dec. 3., 35376=Koch and the company also asked the court to consider the historic role of the Koch family as owners of the business. Established in 1946 as Santa Claus Land Inc. by Louis J. Koch, the park has always been owned by family members. Dan Koch said the share-purchase agreement signed by the three siblings reflected a desire to keep ownership within the family. The suit, he said, threatened to overturn that control., 29725=SANTA CLAUS \u2013 The Kochs of Santa Claus, Spencer County\u2019s most recognized family, entered 2013 on a legal roller coaster that has left, at least for now, majority control of family-owned Holiday World and Splashin\u2019 Safari in the hands of the widow of the park\u2019s former president., 31433=Lori Koch filed her civil suit in January 2011, claiming Koch Development Corp. and Dan Koch failed to abide by a purchase agreement in which the company was obliged to purchase Will Koch\u2019s shares in the company after his death., 30294=Son of William A. Koch and grandson of park founder Louis J. Koch, Will Koch drowned at his home June 13, 2010. His brother, Dan Koch, who was elected president of Holiday World and Splashin\u2019 Safari shortly after Will Koch\u2019s death, was fired by Lori Koch shortly after the verdict was handed down Dec. 3., 30020=A December verdict in a civil suit fought over the past two years in Vanderburgh County left controlling interest of the nation\u2019s oldest theme park with Lori Koch, widow of the park\u2019s late president, Will Koch, and the personal representative of his estate., 37495=\u201cRegardless of the outcome, the park will continue to be owned and operated by members of the Koch family. Holiday World & Splashin\u2019 Safari will open for the 2013 season in May.\u201d Will and Lori Koch have three children, Lauren, Leah and William.}",
