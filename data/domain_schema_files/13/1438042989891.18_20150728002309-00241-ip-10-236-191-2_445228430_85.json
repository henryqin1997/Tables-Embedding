The 2003 SSBF, however, was based on a complex design that involved extensive subsampling and unequal selection probabilities. Complex designs like this typically introduce a design effect that tends to reduce the effective sample size. Design effect (DEFF) is defined as the ratio of the sampling variance reflecting all complexities of the design to the sampling variance expected from a simple random sample of the same size (Kish, 1965). If the design effect is, the effective sample size is the nominal sample size divided by. Thus, to achieve the required precision under the current design, the sample size per size class should be 400*, where indexes the size class . For sample allocation purposes, we assumed a conservative within-class design effect of 1.2556. Therefore, at least 400x1.25=500 completed interviews should be allocated to each size class.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{59721=Owing to a number of changes in the 2003 study from the 1998 study, including changes in sample design, the implementation of new automated lookup procedures for firm and financial institution location, the offer of an incentive, and efforts to improve response rates, there were substantive changes required for both the screener and the questionnaire. The general organization and content of the screener and questionnaire are listed below in Sections 2.7 and 2.8, respectively., 893326=In discussions between project staff and FRB staff, many uncertainties were identified with regard to the methods used by InfoUSA to conduct a match. We therefore determined that pretesting was necessary. After many conversations with InfoUSA, we identified three match procedures to test, using the 1000 sampled cases intended for the two pretests., 295806=\u2022 If the firm was in business during the last month in which the firm could have been called for a screening interview (e.g., August 2004 for batch one), 675547=This section discusses nonresponse subsampling and its impact on sampling errors. Subsampling of screener and main interview nonrespondents was a major design innovation introduced to the 2003 SSBF59. The purpose of subsampling was to improve the chances of achieving the challenging response rate goal while controlling for cost and nonresponse bias more effectively. The basic concept was to conduct the survey in two phases or passes. We first attempted an interview with all cases that were available for the screener or the main interview in pass 1. Then, in addition to businesses that made appointments with the interviewers to complete the interview, we selected a subsample of nonrespondents (screener and main interview) for further interview attempts in pass 2. Since the pass 2 sample, including all the hard appointment callbacks, represented a fraction of all nonrespondents, we were able to focus limited resources more effectively on a smaller sample in pass 2., 567628=Main Interview Eligibility Rate. The main interview eligibility rate among screener completes also showed significant variation in 1998. The eligibility rate was lower among larger businesses and rural businesses, and the variation was quite substantial. To avoid relying too much on the 1998 experience, we computed the eligibility rate for eight groups formed by the cross of size class and urban/rural status. Table 6.10 presents the 1998 group rate, the ratio of the group rate to the overall rate, and the expected eligibility rate for each group in 2003. The expected 2003 eligibility rate per group was estimated as .65 times the ratio. For example, the expected rate for group one (1-19, urban) was estimated as .65*1.0405=.68., 17058=Table 6.5 Screener Eligibility Rate Among Pass 1 Finalized Nonrespondents/Noncontacts: Estimated From Table 8.18 in the 1998 SSBF Methodology Report 135, 345246=In October NORC implemented the Oktoberfest incentive plan, with the intent to encourage high energy and increase productivity by creating an atmosphere of friendly competition. Interviewers were assigned to one of two teams. The teams competed on daily, weekly and cumulative production projections, which were divided between the teams. Supervisors held team meetings to inform members of the standings and discuss strategies. At the end of the competition, if one team exceeded its cumulative projection, each member of the winning team received a prize valued at $10 to $15. If both teams exceeded their projections, all SSBF interviewers received a more expensive prize. In addition, Oktoberfest included other incentives such as pizza parties., 894967=As described in Section 2.6, NORC ended up using 750 of the 1000 firms that were originally selected for pretests 1 and 2 for pretest 1. By calling these firms to conduct screening interviews, NORC was able to classify most businesses in the Pretest 1 sample as either operational or non-operational. In addition, NORC conducted various locating activities to resolve any unknown classifications., 7064=4.7.13 Level of Effort 99, 476330=\u2022 Businesses that were in operation December 31, 2003 under one or more of the current owners and were still in operation as of the date of the main interview., 33025=Study the effects of bank mergers, bank consolidation, and interstate banking on credit use by small businesses. The 2003 SSBF will provide a fourth cross section to study these issues, enhancing analysts' ability to study changes in bank lending behavior over time. The SSBF questions on the types of credit used and the amounts of each type of credit from various sources and credit turn downs are important for this objective. The 2003 SSBF will also provide a benchmark for statistics collected from large banks on small business lending under the Community Reinvestment Act., 220483=This section discusses more fully the implementation of the fourth batch, which was not part of the original design and which was treated differently than other batches. Response rates were lower than originally anticipated. As a result, in October 2004, the FRB and NORC agreed that a fourth sample batch was necessary to ensure that NORC would complete 4,000 main interviews by January 31, 2005. Batch four differed from the previous batches in three ways: size, schedule and protocol., 549915=Screener Completion Rates. Table 8.21 in The 1998 SSBF Methodology Report contains the screener nonresponse adjustment factors for 352 subgroups defined by employment size, urban/rural status, and census division. From this table, we derived the 1998 screener completion rates for the subgroups corresponding to the 2003 sampling strata. Our analysis showed that urban businesses, smaller businesses, and businesses in the New England and Middle Atlantic Census divisions experienced lower completion rates than their counterparts. To capture this variation, we computed the 1998 screener completion rates for nine groups of businesses. We first combined size classes 20-49, 50-99, and 100-499 to form a single 20-499 size class. Next, we divided each of the two redefined size classes (1-19 and 20-499) between urban and rural. Finally, we divided each size and urban/rural combination into two geographic categories (region 1 and the other three regions combined) except that urban businesses of size 20-499 were divided into three categories (region 1, region 2, and the other two regions combined)57., 359179=Table 4.24 shows the incidence of returned worksheets by sample batch. Interviewers may have gotten more adept over the course of study in asking respondents to return materials. In December, NORC provided interviewers with an alternative text to the CATI text asking respondents to return their materials; NORC believed that the new script was more forceful and persuasive (see Appendix C.17). Both may contribute to the observed improvement in the percentage of returned worksheets among batch four respondents compared to those in the first three batches., 43490=The first activity undertaken after contract award was questionnaire development. Prior to the start of the contract, the questionnaire from 1998 was modified to incorporate changes made by the FRB as well as to improve question wording, to include additional questions on respondent incentives, to re-order questions within the loan type section, and to re-work numerous skips in the questionnaire. Testing for the study was conducted through two pretests, executed sequentially. In addition to informing questionnaire design, the pretests helped to test the sample drawn from Dun and Bradstreet, allowed a trial run of data collection processes and protocols, and assisted in testing the Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) instrument. The preparation for the initial pretest began in February 2004. Data collection took place over a five-week period during March and April 2004. The preparation for the second pretest began in early April 2004. The second pretest began in late April and was completed in early June 2004., 55321=NORC and FRB staff engaged in ongoing questionnaire design over a nine-month period, between October 2003 and June 2004. The activities began with a review of the questionnaire in consultation with FRB and NORC staff and an outside small business accountant. Included in the design period was the programming of the two instruments into a computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) package. A significant amount of time was spent during the design period testing the CATI instrument. The questionnaires were reviewed for questionnaire wording, format, and flow and skips. Following each pretest, a debriefing with the pretest interviewers helped inform additional changes., 890548=NORC's past experience with the D&B database suggested that these data contained errors, one of which is the inclusion of firms no longer in business and hence ineligible for the 2003 SSBF. Our original proposal called for matching the D&B to data from InfoUSA, a compiler of business telephone directories. The idea was to use a second source of information to identify firms with a lower probability of being in business, so that these firms could be subsampled in an effort to reduce data collection costs. Firms in the D&B file for which no match could be found in the InfoUSA file would be considered suspect in terms of still being in business. The premise of such a match is that two sources showing a business in operation increases the ex ante probability that the business is genuinely in operation. Thus, our original approach involved matching our D&B sample to InfoUSA, treating all matches as very likely to be in operation and including those in the fielded sample with certainty. For those businesses in D&B with no match in InfoUSA, we planned to assume a lower likelihood of being in operation and therefore, to subsample from this group to reduce the number of non-existent businesses we would try to reach., 203670=As originally planned, the first two sample batches would each comprise about 40% of the sample with a third and final sample batch comprising 20%. However, due to a lower-than-expected completion rate, batch three was increased to be the same size as the first two batches, and a fourth sample batch of 6,800 cases was released in November 2004 (see next section). With the addition of the fourth batch and the increased size of the third batch, each of the first three batches comprised 23.8% of the total sample with the larger batch four comprising 28.6% (Table 4.4)., 298887=Send 1st-class mailing. NORC sent 1st-class mailings to 112 noncontacts on December 20-21, 2004. The contents of the mailing were:, 980551=Haggerty, C., Grigorian, K., Harter, R., and Stewart, A.

This chapter analyzes each of these elements individually and makes some suggestions as to what might be done to improve the study the next time. The chapter concludes with a discussion of a realistic project schedule and budgeting of time and resources., 465377=NORC reviewed and coded approximately half of the business problem coding, and sent the results to the FRB for review and comments on January 21, 2005. During this initial review, NORC identified more categories and proposed that these categories be added to the code frame:, 191768=Sample batches. For the main study, cases were released in discrete batches rather than all at once. The sampling plan originally called for releasing two batches of 5,666 cases and a third batch of approximately 3,800 cases. Because of a lower-than-expected completion rate, batch three was increased to be the same size as the previous two batches, and a fourth batch of 6,800 additional cases was released in November 2004. Sample batches are discussed in more detail in Chapter 6., 222451=In main interviewing, batch four cases were called by interviewers who tended to be among the strongest interviewers on the project. Main batch four cases were sent conversion letters offering a $200 incentive on a rolling basis - once per week during December 2004. Near the end of data collection, in January 2005, all eligible batch four cases completing the screener were offered $200 to complete the main, as opposed to the $50 dollars offered to batch four respondents completing the screener prior to this. Because of the impending end of the data collection period, NORC accelerated the process of offering the larger incentive amount, rather than wait to make this offer when respondents were contacted to complete the main interview., 298447=Match sample to more current D&B database. NORC sent Duns numbers for all 113 cases to D&B. D&B matched the original sample, which had been drawn from D&B's database of businesses as of May 2004, to a more current database of businesses as of December 2004. From this step, NORC identified one firm (1%) as having gone out of business; additional locating steps were not performed for this firm., 54926=Questionnaire development for the 2003 SSBF screener and questionnaire began shortly after the contract award in October 2003. The FRB provided NORC with a modified version of the 1998 SSBF questionnaire, at which point NORC, the FRB, and an accounting consultant worked together to design the screener and questionnaire for both pretests and ultimately for the main data collection., 110640=\u2022 Screened for whether the business was in operation during December 2003 under one or more of its current owners, 332078=Email follow-up. One day after sending conversion letters, NORC sent email messages to owners for whom we had email addresses43. The message was a shorter version of the conversion letter - a review of the reasons for participating. The email message asked recipients to look for a Federal Express package from NORC. The text referenced the SSBF hotline and links to NORC's and the FRB's websites for the 2003 SSBF. A copy of the email letter is in Appendix TT., 231183=\u2022 In 1998, interviewers completed screeners with 69% of sampled respondents (see The 1998 SSBF Methodology Report Table 6.4). In 2003, interviewers completed screeners with only 59% of sampled respondents (see Table 4.13 below). This lower-than-anticipated response rate worked to increase the average administration time., 81884=Data collection was conducted for the first pretest between March 10 and April 6, 2004, and for the second pretest between May 11 and May 27, 2004. Assessing completion rates was not an objective of either pretest. Rather, NORC wanted to complete 50 main interviews as quickly as possible with small business owners whose businesses were determined to be eligible for the survey based on the screening interview., 17547=Table 6.9 Expected Screener Completion Rate by Group: Estimated from Table 8.21 in the 1998 SSBF Methodology Report 142, 347202=NORC believed that increasing the respondent incentive would have a positive effect on response rate: a larger token of appreciation would likely help convince some reluctant respondents to participate. NORC began increasing respondent fees with sample batch four. Batch four main cases that were sent conversion letters were offered $200. This was double the $100 fee offered in the previous batches. On January 6, 2005, all pending main cases from any batch became eligible for a $200 incentive, and interviewers were instructed to mention the increased incentive in their introductions., 110029=The screener questionnaire can be found in Appendix D. The median administration time for the screener was 11.2 minutes and the mean administration time was 13.2 minutes17. (See Appendix E for an explanation of how these statistics were calculated.) The 2003 SSBF screener accomplished the following:, 476869=The second criterion stated that only businesses that were not branches, divisions, or subsidiaries of a parent business were eligible for the survey. The third criterion included only businesses with less than 500 employees in the target population. An employee was an owner or some other worker in the business whether he or she was paid or not. The last criterion about operational status was more stringent than its 1998 counterpart, in that the business needed to be in operation at the time of the main interview. To be eligible in 1998, a business only needed to be in operation as of December 31, 1998., 33633=Provide important financial statement data for small businesses that are not available systematically from any other source. The 2003 SSBF will be a current micro database containing information on small firms' financial statements. No private or publicly available data set provides such comprehensive, nationally representative data on the financial condition of individual small businesses. One use for the SSBF data will be to improve the quality of estimates of aggregate statistics in the Board's Flow of Funds Accounts. The Statistics of Income Division of the Internal Revenue Service, the primary data source for the noncorporate business sector in the Flow of Funds Accounts, provides an income statement but no balance sheet data for proprietorships. The three previous surveys' data for proprietors' income statements and balance sheets were used to construct a benchmark for estimating asset and liability amounts for this sector; the 2003 SSBF will be used similarly., 36240=Small businesses are extremely important to the U.S. economy. According to the Small Business Administration (SBA), in 2001, 99.7% of all firms had fewer than 500 employees. These firms employed more than half of the private sector workforce and accounted for 75% of the new jobs created. Small businesses accounted for approximately half of the gross domestic product (GDP). Starting and maintaining a small business is fraught with challenges. In 2001, almost 585,000 new firms with fewer than 500 employees were created, but almost 553,000 went out of business during that same period. Small business loans increased between 1999 and 2000 from 7.73 million to 9.8 million, with almost 27% of the increase attributable to loans of under $100,000. In part, the SSBF is conducted to help researchers better understand how such changes in the financial marketplace affect the acquisition and use of financial services by small businesses., 230661=\u2022 The number of calls required to complete a screener increased from 5.4 in 1998 to 6.7 in 2003 (see Appendix HH for 2003 number of calls). Median administration time increased from 4.5 minutes per case in 1998 to 11.2 minutes per case in 200330. Overall, the average number of calls made to firms during screening increased from 6.9 calls per case in 1998 to 9.5 calls per case in 2003., 479661=As in all prior rounds of the survey, the 2003 SSBF used the DMI file to construct the sampling frame to represent the target population. However, unlike in previous years, NORC used a complete listing of all population firms to draw the sample rather than having D&B draw the sample. The DMI is based on D&B's credit rating services and business telephone listings, and it is widely considered the best commercially available business database. NORC considered supplementing the DMI file using the InfoUSA business database. After extensive research, however, we decided not to use the InfoUSA database for this purpose. Section 6.11.2 summarizes this research., 981240=Small Business Survey Group. (1999). Codebook for 1993 National Survey of Small Business Finances (NSSBF). Washington, DC: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System., 892520=After the start of the project, an additional fact came to light, which is that InfoUSA collects information to flag businesses on their list as being non-operational, or out of business (OOB). For our purposes on the 2003 SSBF, this results in three categories of businesses: 1) D&B businesses that match to InfoUSA businesses as operational, 2) D&B businesses that match to InfoUSA businesses as non-operational, and 3) D&B businesses that do not match to InfoUSA businesses at all., 295708=\u2022 If the firm was in business in December 2003 under one or more of its current owners, 886733=Final Screening Sample: As discussed in Section 6.5, the final screening sample size was bigger than initially estimated under the most optimistic assumptions. We first increased the size of batch 3 as soon as it became clear that the actual screener and main interview completion rates were much lower than expected. We then added a batch 4 based on various realized outcome rates in early October 2004. Analytical results indicated that sample balancing was not necessary for batch 3 or batch 4 since the productivity of the five sample balancing groups was similar at the time of the evaluation. Finally, the added batch 4 was not subjected to nonresponse subsampling due to timing constraints., 272627=NORC attempted to complete as many screeners as possible. The number of screened eligible cases determined the number of cases that could become completed main interviews. For screening, the unweighted completion rate is defined as the percentage of cases worked that resulted in completed interviews. When screening ended on January 21, 2005, NORC interviewers had completed 14,061 cases for an unweighted completion rate of 59.1%. Completed screeners comprised:, 242811=As previously stated, the two-pass protocol was not used for sample batch four. Instead, batch four screening cases that had been worked to the pass one protocol and had the last four dispositions in the above list were sent screener refusal letters after being worked for about four weeks. There were two mailings to pending batch four screener cases that had a refusal call outcome; both mailings were in December 2004., 135524=\u2022 D&B Small Business Solutions \u00ae Brochure. NORC offered respondents access to Dun and Bradstreet's (D&B) Small Business Solutions \u00ae package as an alternative to a monetary incentive. The package that SSBF respondents were offered provided the respondent with one comprehensive report on any company in the Dun and Bradstreet database, one credit evaluator, one industry research report including 25 leads, and two Duns demand letters for collections. The package, which retailed for $199, was described in the color brochure, and the information was also made available to interviewers. The incentive and the brochure (Appendix W) describing it were new for 2003., 138205=Worksheet mailings were sent to firms that screened eligible for the main survey. In preparation for data collection, NORC reviewed the contents of the 1998 worksheet mailing and made a number of changes, some of which are described in Section 3.2. Generally, the purpose of the changes was to make the worksheet mailing more appealing and user-friendly. Besides the materials themselves, NORC thought about which pieces should be on top to make the packet inviting when initially opened., 944321=Finally, NORC used the information gained in the pretest about the operating status of the firm to evaluate InfoUSA's Out-of-Business flag. InfoUSA's term for those records flagged as not in operation is \"nixie.\" In all, 19 of the 1000 firms in the pretest sample were flagged nixies; 12 of these appeared among the 750 firms comprising the sample for Pretest 1. Of these 12, six were determined to be in business during the pretest and six were determined not to be in operation. Given that less than 8% of the overall sample was found not to be in operation, a 50% out-of-operation rate for nixies shows that this flag has some predictive power. However, given the level of effort InfoUSA claims to make before it flags a record as out of business, a 50% in-business rate is a dismal failure. Given the small sample size, we hesitate to draw too firm a conclusion. It is possible that we encountered a very bad draw, i.e., that if we had a larger sample of nixies, perhaps the in-business rate would turn out much lower. However, based on what information we have, we do not consider the nixie flag to be of value for the 2003 SSBF sample design., 697169=Design effects could arise from various sources: clustering, stratification, unequal weighting, post-stratification, and other complex design features. Unequal weighting was the main source of design effects for the 2003 SSBF. The design effects due to unequal weighting may be estimated by,, 131245=\u2022 Buckslip. For the 2003 SSBF NORC added a buckslip to the advance mailing (Appendix O). The green buckslip was about the size of a No. 10 envelope; printed on it was an official FRB seal and three bulleted sentences. Its purpose was to increase the incidence of recipients who came away from the mailing with the major communication points, even if they looked at nothing else in the mailing. The buckslip was the first item respondents saw when they opened the envelope., 542440=The second approach to estimating the screening sample size was based on stratum-specific assumptions of completion rates and eligibility rates derived from the 1998 survey results. We started by allocating the 4,000 interviews to the strata through a raking program to meet the survey's precision requirement. We then inflated the stratum allocation by stratum-specific eligibility rates and completion rates at various stages to derive the screening sample size per stratum. Therefore, the second approach was the same as the first approach except that it was separately done for each stratum using stratum-specific assumptions. The total sample size was the sum of the stratum sample sizes. The advantage of this approach is that it led to an allocation of the screening sample across strata., 340865=The program continued through January 15, 2005 to help ensure that production goals - completing a certain number of screeners and main interviews each week - were met to complete data collection by the end of January., 112273=The 2003 SSBF questionnaire had a median administration time of 57.6 minutes and a mean administration time of 59.1 minutes18. It would be impractical to attempt to describe all of the types of information asked for in the questionnaire; for that level of detail, one should consult the questionnaire itself. This report section provides a highlight of the questions and purposes of each section of the questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised the following sections:, 896449=NORC's analysis of the resulting matches spawned questions about the Loose Match (LM) and the 6-digit Match (6M) that were never satisfactorily answered by InfoUSA. The Standard Match (SM), however, lived up to expectations. As InfoUSA predicted, the SM resulted in matches for approximately 60% of the D&B sample (n=592 of 1000 in-business firms). There were also 19 out-of-business firms, which InfoUSA refers to as \"nixies.\" Moreover, close inspection of the matched records revealed that these matches appeared to meet the specified matching criteria., 48161=Main interviewing began June 29, 2004 and ended January 31, 2005. The main questionnaire interview collected information on the following:, 306512=NORC sent the FRB all information it had amassed for each noncontact, including call records, call notes, outcomes of online searches and certified mailings, and completed or partially completed questionnaires, plus, for each case, NORC's recommended status. The FRB reviewed all of the materials, for some cases changed NORC's recommended status, and on February 3, 2004 provided NORC with a final, FRB-approved eligibility status for all noncontacts as well as all nonrespondents., 133157=\u2022 FAQ Brochure. A revised version of the General Information brochure, called the Frequently Asked Questions Brochure, was included in the worksheet mailing (Appendix R). It included a description of the tokens of appreciation under the heading \"What will I get out of this?\" This information was omitted from the pre-screening brochure to ensure that screener respondents did not form the incorrect impression that they would receive an incentive for completing the screening interview only. The brochure was not significantly changed from 1998., 195717=NORC used a two-pass approach for screening and conducting main interviews. The approach was new for SSBF in 2003 and not been used previously at NORC. Previous SSBF surveys used a single-pass approach that involved working all cases with equal intensity. NORC's proposal for the 2003 SSBF specified using a two-pass approach, introducing subsampling among cases not easily completed. The anticipated benefit of the two-pass approach was to reduce excessive efforts in trying to reach cases with low probabilities of completion by quickly completing the easiest of cases and then only attempting a subsample of the more difficult cases. Table 4.2 highlights the purposes of passes one and two., 722031=These changes have important analytical implications. The analyst is likely to use the updated information to define size classes, and such a redefinition would drastically increase the design effect per size class. The impact on design effect is greater when businesses moved from a lower class to a higher class because such businesses were sampled with lower probability and they would carry extremely large weights in the new size class. As a result, the design effect was dramatically increased in the three larger size classes, as shown in Table 6.21. We implemented weight trimming procedures to reduce the impact of the extreme weights; these procedures are discussed in Section 6.9.10. The final design effect due to unequal weighting per size class is reported in Table 6.22., 973395=There are many questions in the SSBF questionnaire that request dollar amounts. The amounts reported by respondents vary widely across firms. Because it is possible to indicate the same amount using a variety of expressions (e.g., one million six, one million six hundred thousand, and one point six million), the 2003 SSBF displayed all dollar amounts in words after they had been entered numerically. Interviewers read back the dollar amounts in the words displayed on the screen, to verify that amounts had been interpreted and entered accurately. Errors were immediately corrected. To this point, no further analysis has been done on the reliability of the data collected. Anecdotally, interviewers indicated that errors were occasionally identified and corrected. Some respondents expressed irritation or annoyance with this procedure, but interviewers were trained to explain the need for it, and respondents quickly learned to accept their role in ensuring the accuracy of these critical data., 346348=NORC introduced two other bonus programs in January 2005. The programs' purpose was to keep interviewers working on SSBF into the new year. One program encouraged interviewers to work all their scheduled hours to the end of the data collection: interviewers received a $50 bonus for staying to the end of SSBF data collection and working 90% of their scheduled hours; $75 for working 91% to 99% of their scheduled hours, and $100 for working all their scheduled hours. The other program paid interviewers an extra $100 for working 40 hours in the last week of January., 6950=4.7.10 Drop/Add Forms 93, 58200=As discussed previously, business owners were sent a worksheet to fill out prior to the questionnaire interview to aid the telephone interview. The design of the worksheets was a two-sided form that requested financial record data on one side and financial services and sources of financing on the other side. Each of four possible business types (sole proprietorship, partnership, S corporation and C corporation) had a unique worksheet. Although the worksheets were similar to those used in 1998, some changes were necessitated by changes in business tax law and tax forms. One difference from 1998 was that the worksheets no longer needed to be customized by fiscal year-end date since the tax forms for fiscal year end 2003 and fiscal year end 2002 were identical7. As a result, there were only four worksheet versions as compared to the ten required in 1998. In addition, the worksheets were somewhat redesigned so that the layout and flow of the worksheet questions was easier to follow, the instructions were more easily understood, and the explanations of how to use the worksheet as an aid in providing data were clearer., 261775=NORC and the FRB decided that beginning in mid-December, screener refusal letters (and other respondent correspondence) would be modified to include the end date of data collection, i.e., January 31, 2005, the last day on which respondents could complete the main interview. The purpose was two-fold: 1) to create a sense of timeliness, if not urgency - completing the survey could not be delayed or postponed indefinitely; and 2) to provide respondents with needed information - after a certain date they would no longer be able to take the survey or be eligible for an incentive., 333734=Accountants that completed portions of the SSBF main interview for their clients were paid by NORC at one time. Checks were processed and mailed on February 23, 2005. Payments ranged from $75 to $262.50, with a mean payment of $162. The majority of the payments were between $100 and $200. Nine accountants were paid., 356043=Monitoring observations were shared with interviewers during one-on-one sessions and group meetings. Feedback was typically provided within several days of monitoring. Through December 2004, the FRB sent electronic monitoring forms to NORC; the FRB's comments and ratings were communicated to interviewers., 155723=NORC conducted four interviewer training sessions beginning in June 2004 (in addition to the trainings conducted for the pretests). For the first three sessions, trainees were instructed on administering both screener and main interviews. Briefly, the focus of screener training was on familiarizing interviewers with the purposes of the study and instructing them on how to adhere to the research protocol and gain respondent cooperation. Topics specifically addressed were the importance of the survey eligibility criteria (e.g., whether the firm was in business during December 2003 with one or more of its current owners), the protocol necessary to identify the appropriate respondent, and relaying to the respondent the confidentiality of information provided to the interviewer. The training for the main interview delved more deeply into the substance of the survey to assure NORC that interviewers were familiar with the terms used, and could elicit meaningful data from the respondents, particularly about complex financial activities., 76360=Programming for the 2003 SSBF screener and questionnaire began in early January 2004 and continued into September 2004. The CATI program manager attended meetings in which the questionnaire content was reviewed and changes discussed. The program manager asked questions about presentation, response categories, allowable ranges, and consistency and contingency checks. The desired specifications were noted in a hard-copy questionnaire and then documented electronically in the programmer's log. The specifications were then translated into SurveyCraft code (the programming language used for the CATI instrument). As changes were made to the questionnaire, this process was repeated until the questionnaire was deemed final., 309266=The letter asked respondents to return the SAQ to NORC by December 30, 2004. This is consistent with professional standards that recommend allowing respondents two weeks to return an SAQ. Respondents were given the option of mailing or faxing the SAQ, or they could call the SSBF hotline and have the interview administered over the telephone by an SSBF supervisor. NORC trained the supervisors who maintained the SSBF hotline to administer the SAQ and to answer respondents' questions about the 5% follow-up., 131746=\u2022 General information brochure. The brochure was included in the advance mailing and contained answers to frequently asked questions about the study (Appendix P). The brochure was updated from 1998, including the logo; the name, address and phone number of the project director; and the SSBF website addresses., 31713=In October 2003, the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago was awarded the contract to conduct the 2003 SSBF, which was to have similar content to the previous three surveys. This report documents the methods used to conduct the 2003 SSBF, from the planning stages in October 2003 and through its completion in April 2005., 111328=Although most screener questions used in 2003 closely resembled those used in 1998, a major change was that the demographic information of the owner was not collected during screening. Minority oversampling was dropped for the 2003 survey, so there was no need to collect this information during screening. In addition, NORC reviewed the 1998 version of the screening questionnaire to update the eligibility questions for 2003, identified and removed questions that no longer applied, improved the wording on a few questions and interviewer scripts to make them clearer and more respondent-friendly, and mentioned the financial incentive in the closing statement to eligible firms., 142346=The FRB provided a page on its website for the 2003 SSBF (www.federalreserve.gov/ssbf/). The page explained the purpose of the study; had excerpts from speeches given by FRB officials referencing the SSBF; and had links to the Alan Greenspan letter, frequently asked questions, and references and abstracts of research that used data from the 1987, 1993, and 1998 SSBF surveys (Appendix DD)., 223450=NORC originally planned to start main study data collection in March 2004, and finish in October 2004. However, delays in developing the sampling plan and in developing, programming and testing the CATI questionnaires, resulted in the start date being moved to June 10. The end date was subsequently moved to November 2004, but with the introduction of sample batch four, the final end date was January 31, 2005., 905416=As Table 6.35 shows, 92% of the firms sampled from D&B for Pretest 1 were operating as a business at the time of the pretest. The driving force behind the matching with InfoUSA data was the assumption that in-operation rate of firms in the D&B sample would be lower than 92%. The five percent follow-up subsample of the 1998 SSBF suggests an estimate of 88 to 90%67. Nevertheless, 8% of the main survey sample of 37,600 firms translates into 3,008 out-of-business firms. Therefore, the value of predicting out-of-business firms, without having to go through the screening process, is still valuable. It is noteworthy that, of the 62 pretest cases finalized as either N or U, the average number of calls made to reach this disposition was 5.4 (minimum calls=1, maximum calls 26, mode=4). Therefore, potential cost savings do exist by identifying firm characteristics that make an enterprise likely to be out of business., 964184=Reducing this interval seemed to have been effective. Interviewer labor associated with the main questionnaire was lower in 2003 compared with 1998, suggesting that respondents were able to recall screening, and that the rapport established during screening was still in effect. It posed other operational and logistical challenges (i.e., the need to ship worksheets promptly to eligible businesses, coordinating the close-down of screening interviews in order to subsample for pass two of main interviewing within batches), but NORC was prepared to handle these challenges. NORC has not conducted any in-depth cost-benefit analysis to determine whether data quality was improved or other possible benchmarks were improved compared to the 1998 survey. It is safe to conclude, though, that it is logistically possible to run the study under the new time frame., 509205=The three scenarios represented different levels of expected completion rates. Under Scenario 1, which assumed the lowest completion rates, the screening sample needed to include 28,775 businesses. Scenario 2 was based on higher completion rates that were expected with improved operational procedures for the 2003 survey. Under Scenario 2, the screening sample would consist of 18,910 businesses. The most optimistic Scenario 3 was designed to achieve an overall response rate of 60% as required by the FRB. Under Scenario 3, the sample would include only 13,660 businesses. Since the goal was to achieve a 60% response rate, the estimated screening sample size under scenario 3 was taken as the final estimate under the first approach. The specific assumptions used in the scenarios are discussed in the following section., 24020=Appendix F. 2003 SSBF Logos, 347803=On January 19, 2005, NORC increased the financial incentive from $200 to $500 for all pending main cases excluding those in batch four. Again, interviewers were instructed to mention the increased incentive in their introductions. The higher incentive caught the attention of some respondents from the earlier batches, respondent who had expressed their reluctance many times over the weeks or months since they had completed the screener, or who had completed part of the main interview but for some time had been unwilling or unable to complete it. Because sample batch four had only recently been released at this time, NORC decided that it was not necessary to raise the incentive for batch four. Batch four cases had not aged to the degree that the increased incentive would be warranted., 140995=NORC created a website specifically for 2003 SSBF, compliant with Section 508 of the Federal Disabilities Act. The address (www.norc.org/ssbf) was included in project director letters and other materials. The purpose of the website was to encourage respondent cooperation, by reinforcing the legitimacy of the survey and by providing an inviting and helpful repository of information and documents for the study. Even if a respondent only read the home page (Appendix CC), he or she would understand the study's objectives and the benefits of participating., 885544=500+ firms: In order to minimize the potential of frame error, the initial proposal was to subsample a small number of cases with more than 500 employees to determine what proportion of them would actually qualify for the study. This had been done in the previous years of the SSBF. Unlike the previous SSBF, the 2003 survey excluded businesses with 500 or more employees from its target population., 466807=Nearly 60 percent of all respondents indicated an \"other/specify\" response. NORC delivered the final file of all responses on March 2, 2005, which included 5613 coded items in total, all but 234 of which were coded into existing or proposed categories., 6985=4.7.11 Weekly Production Reports 94, 530202=Screener Eligibility Rate Among Those Ineligible for Subsampling. We next estimated the screener eligibility rate (i.e., proportion of live businesses) among finalized nonrespondents/ noncontacts. This eligibility rate was needed to calculate the final screener completion rate since businesses ineligible for the screener would be subtracted from the denominator in calculating the screener completion rate. In 1998, a 5% subsample was selected from screener incompletes for follow-up screening attempts. Based on the current definition, this sample of 621 screener incompletes included 247 noncontacts. The 1998 follow-up survey was able to contact 95 (38%) businesses among these former noncontact cases. If we consider a contact as evidence that the business was still in operation, then the contact rate provided a reasonable estimate of the proportion of live businesses among the initially noncontact cases. We used this contact rate to estimate the proportion of live businesses among finalized nonrespondents/noncontacts after pass 1 of the 2003 screening interview. Table 6.5 lists the types of cases in the 1998 5% sample that were considered finalized nonrespondents or noncontacts., 473436=The final SSBF analysis sample consisted of the businesses that completed the main interview (see Chapter 4 for a discussion of completeness requirements). An analysis weight was calculated for each complete case to support weighted estimation. The primary purpose of weighting was to correct for potential bias due to unequal selection probabilities and nonresponse. A secondary purpose of weighting was to adjust for ineligible businesses that were part of the original sample of 37,600 businesses. Informally, the analysis weight approximated the number of businesses in the target population that the responding business represented. The final analysis weight was calculated in multiple stages. The first stage was the calculation of the initial base weight to account for the sample design. The base weight for a sample business was the reciprocal of the probability of selection under the sample design. The subsequent weighting stages represented adjustments to the base weight for batch selection, sample release, screener and main eligibility, screener nonresponse subsampling, screener nonresponse, main interview nonresponse subsampling, and main interview nonresponse. Finally, outlier weights were trimmed as described in Section 6.9.10., 302205=As part of locating, in January 2005, NORC sent certified letters to all noncontacts for which eligibility status had not been confirmed. The contents of the certified mailing were identical to those of the 1st-class mailing sent in December 2004. Undeliverable certified mail was an indication that a firm, while not necessarily out of business, was likely to no longer be at the D&B-preloaded address. A delivered certified letter was an indicator, though less reliable, that a firm existed at the address we had for the firm37., 24599=Appendix Q. Worksheet Mailing: 1998 Results Brochure, 174385=The 2003 Survey of Small Business Finances Trainers' Guide for Main Screener (June 2004) consisted of modules describing the concepts and materials covered during training. The module instructions outlined the learning goals for that section, the presentation mode (e.g., lecture, round-robin mock interview), the materials needed, and an explanation of the importance of each topic., 65223=A number of changes were made to the 2003 questionnaire from the one used in 1998. Table 2.2 provides an overview of the key changes. In addition to the changes in Table 2.1, NORC and the FRB made many improvements to the 2003 questionnaire including question wording, question-by-question (QxQ) help notes9, interviewer instructions, and question ordering., 63661=One substantive change in the screener resulted from a change in the sampling design. In 1998, minority businesses were oversampled. This requirement was relaxed in 2003 and hence questions on race and ethnicity were no longer needed in the screener8. Firm names and physical locations were verified to better deal with known problems with the D&B frame data. The question about the most significant problem facing the firm was moved from the main to the screener so that this information could be used to help convince firms to participate in the main questionnaire or later in the field period. In the end, it was not used in this manner. The introduction text was significantly enhanced and a protocol was implemented to ensure that interviewers made three attempts to speak with the owner before they were permitted to collect screener data from a knowledgeable proxy. These changes were made to maximize the number of screeners completed with the most knowledgeable screener respondent (an owner), reduce the number of screeners completed with someone at the firm other than the owner, and exercise greater control over the selection of proxy respondents to ensure data quality., 56010=Because of the technical nature of some of the questions asked in the questionnaire, eligible firms were mailed and asked to complete a worksheet prior to the interview and to use the worksheet as an aid during the interview. At the end of the interview, respondents were encouraged to return their completed worksheet6 to NORC. Some changes to the 1998 worksheets were required. NORC and the FRB spent some time modifying the worksheet to reflect current tax laws and questionnaire changes., 130797=\u2022 Letter from Alan Greenspan. The FRB provided NORC with a persuasion letter from Chairman Greenspan, used in the 1998 study and updated for the 2003 SSBF (Appendix N). The letter explained the purpose of the survey and asked for respondents' cooperation. To allay concerns about confidentiality and privacy, the letter was not personalized. The letter was sent both in the advance mailing and in the worksheet mailing., 294273=The 5 percent follow-up task was originally scheduled to start on September 16, 2004 and last three weeks. However, with the introduction of batch four in November and its inclusion in the follow-up, data collection actually started during the first week of December., 972850=Many enhancements to questionnaire ordering, wording, and skip patterns were implemented in the 2003 SSBF CATI. Of particular importance are the dollar amount read-back and the institution look-up, both of which were implemented to improve overall data quality., 4565=3.5 2003 SSBF WEBSITE 34, 962664=The sampling design for the 2003 study differed from 1998 in two main ways. First, no minority oversample was required, which had a large impact on the amount of time necessary between the screening and the main interview. Second, the sample was drawn in batches and then systematically subsampled for both screening and main interviews, which introduced significant logistical problems in managing the batches and the subsampling. The next subsections discuss various aspects of the design from an operational standpoint., 884539=The design of the 2003 SSBF evolved somewhat from the initial proposal to the formal plan and to final execution. All changes were made with the active participation and consent of the FRB. Most of these changes are described in the prior sections. This section provides a summary of all the design changes. Then, it focuses on the decision not to match the sample to the InfoUSA database., 541856=The last row of Table 6.3 shows the expected overall response rate under each scenario. Under Scenario 1, the overall response rate would be 32%, a rate close to the 1998 level; under scenario 2, the overall response rate would be 46%; and Scenario 3 would achieve a response rate of 60%, the rate required by the FRB., 206864=Telephone data collection began on June 10, 2004, when the initial sample replicates were released for interviewing. Table 4.5 shows the weekly release of cases and production data., 157307=As mentioned, the fourth training session in September was for the screener only because NORC needed more interviewers to increase screener production. The fourth training session ran on a Thursday and Friday, with certification the following week. The next table shows basic information on training, including the attrition rate for each group of certified interviewers., 337542=Providing additional training on financial questions. Many respondents were reluctant or unwilling to provide information about their firm's financial profile. These questions about a firm's income and expenses, assets, liabilities and equity were in sections P, R, and S. When the FRB began identifying cases with insufficient data (i.e., too many don't know (DK) or refused (RF) responses), most DKs and RFs came in sections P, R, and S. In early October, NORC provided interviewers with a special training session. Interviewers were reminded about the importance of these items, and about techniques they could use to convince respondents to answer these potentially sensitive but critical financial questions. The techniques were:, 249227=NORC made several protocol changes for the screener once the main study began. Interviewers were instructed to break off an interview and report the case to a supervisor if the firm's primary business appeared to be ranching or raising livestock. These firms were considered to be farms and therefore out-of-scope for SSBF 2003., 7031=4.7.12 CATI Changes 94, 134693=In updating the 1998 worksheets, NORC's consulting accountant revised the tax-form line-number references to match the appropriate tax forms and ensure that each worksheet version reflected current tax laws and accounting practices. NORC's instrument design team redesigned the worksheet so that the layout was more attractive and logical to follow, the instructions were more easily understood, and the explanation of how to use the worksheet as an aid in providing data was clearer. In addition, because the federal tax forms did not change between 2002 and 2003, worksheets did not need to be customized by fiscal year-end date as they had in 1998. This change reduced the number of worksheet versions from ten in 1998 to four in 2003. In addition, NORC added a fax number to the bottom of side one of the worksheet., 951082=Because of the technical nature of the study, the ideal SSBF interviewer needs strong numerical facility, a good understanding of business and accounting terms, and the communication and persuasion skills that NORC has found essential to interviewing success. Many potential candidates possessed some but not all of these characteristics. For the 2003 SSBF, we looked first to find candidates with financial backgrounds, and second to find those that had the communication and persuasion skills required of interviewers., 129724=The second project director letter was mailed with the worksheets in preparation for the main interview (Appendix M). The letter expressed appreciation for the respondent's participation in the screener, and emphasized the importance of continued participation. It described the materials included in the package and the task we wanted the respondent to complete in filling out the worksheet. It provided an estimate of the amount of time for the phone interview. The letter discussed the respondent-fee options in more detail. It included a telephone number and email address for respondents to contact NORC with questions, and provided a toll-free number for respondents to return their worksheets or other financial records by fax. Changes for 2003 included: 1) adding boxed text to the top of the letter stating \"Please read this letter first.\"; 2) adding summary statements in bold text to the beginning of each paragraph; and 3) emphasizing that respondents may not need to complete the entire worksheet, depending on their firm's circumstances., 31120=To measure the extent to which the financial environment of small businesses has changed since the last survey, the 2003 Survey of Small Business Finances (SSBF) was proposed. The 2003 SSBF was established to collect information from the owners of a nationally representative sample of up to 5,000 business enterprises. It was intended to gather data from small businesses on their financial relationships, credit experiences, lending terms and conditions, income and balance sheet information, the location and types of financial institutions used, and other firm characteristics., 133742=\u2022 Customized Worksheet. NORC revised the 1998 worksheets that were sent to respondents. Respondents were asked to complete the worksheet prior to the interview and to use the worksheet as an aid during the interview. The design retained the structure and overall appearance of the worksheets used in the 1998 survey. The design was a two-sided form, printed on 17x11-inch paper, requesting financial record data on one side and financial services and sources of financing on the other side. Each of four possible business types had a unique worksheet with the appropriate reference lines in the tax return to assist respondents in looking up the data: sole proprietor (Appendix S), partnership (Appendix T), S corporation (Appendix U), and C corporation (Appendix V). The worksheets were printed in red, white and blue for functionality - columns were color-coded - and to reinforce the patriotic element of participation., 849053=Professional organizations such as AAPOR (2004) and CASRO (1982) have defined standard procedures to calculate survey response rates. NORC (2001) has developed its own standard response rate procedures that are consistent with the AAPOR and CASRO guidelines. The methods considered for the 2003 SSBF follow the basic principles in these standard procedures., 13354=Table 2.1 Key Screener Changes from 1998 11, 6324=4.6.11 Eligibility Rate 70, 487563=The current MSAs were those defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) based on application of 2000 standards to 2000 decennial census data and announced by OMB effective December 2003. According to OMB's definition, an MSA consists of one or more whole counties. An MSA is a core area containing a substantial population nucleus, together with adjacent communities having a high degree of economic and social integration with that core. The physical-location zip code in the abstract file was linked to state and county FIPS52 codes. These state and county FIPS codes could link counties and county aggregates to the MSAs, and thus, to urban areas., 963498=One major design change in 2003 was to considerably shorten the time between completion of the screener and the first call to complete the main interview69. The design called for calling a respondent within one week of completing the screener, shortly after he or she had received the worksheet mailing. The intent was to heighten the study's sense of immediacy, reduce the gaining-cooperation challenge for main interviewing, and reduce locating that could result when firms move or go out of business between the screening and the main interview., 179188=The 2003 Survey of Small Business Finances Trainers' Guide for the Main Interview (June 2004) consisted of modules describing the concepts and materials covered during training. The module instructions outline the learning goals for each section, the presentation mode (e.g., lecture, round-robin mock interview), the materials needed, and an explanation of the importance of each topic., 968933=The study used many different respondent materials throughout, most of which were similar to materials used for 1998. For the most part, the materials performed as expected. NORC and the FRB experimented with the content and format of advance and refusal conversion mailings and the wording of refusal conversion letters. The next subsections discuss some of these changes., 975985=In response to the declining response rates observed in previous surveys, the 2003 SSBF design called for offering respondents a token incentive for completing the main interview. Initially, the respondents were offered the choice of either $50 or a Dun & Bradstreet package of reports for small businesses which retailed for $199. As the study progressed, NORC increased the respondent incentive fees. Over the course of the study, the incentive was raised for pass two refusal conversion to $100, then $200, and finally $500., 715925=The overall design effect estimate was 1.664, an increase of about 16% over the 1998 design effect of 1.44. The reason for the moderate increase was that only a small fraction of the complete cases would actually have extreme weights. Based on our analysis, about 80% of all complete cases would be S1M1 cases; about 19% of complete cases would either be S1M2 or S2M1 cases; and less than 1% of the complete cases would be S2M2 cases., 470487=In order to meet the contractual requirement that all items be delivered and approved by March 31, 2005, NORC sent individual deliverables as they were completed. This approach allowed time for the FRB to review each piece and provide comments to NORC, and for NORC to respond to these comments before the deadline., 60465=The major changes made to the 1998 screener are described in Table 2.1., 980342=Council of American Survey Research Organizations. (1982 ). \"On the Definition of Response Rates. A Special Report of the CASRO Task Force on Completion Rates.\" Port Jefferson, NY: CASRO., 32309=The 2003 SSBF had several specific objectives that governed the basic content of the survey. The following list briefly describes each objective requirement associated with the objective., 16813=Table 6.3 2003 SSBF Screening Sample Size Estimation 131, 45929=Screener data collection began on June 10, 2004 and ended January 21, 2005. The screening was designed to verify the name of the business owner and the physical address of the business, screen the business for eligibility to participate, identify the business's legal form of organization, and record the fiscal year-end date. In addition, the screener asked for an address to which Federal Express could deliver a package to the firm's owner and an email address for the firm. The screener included an open-ended question asking respondents to name the single most important problem currently facing their business., 549224=This section discusses procedures to inflate the allocation of complete interviews to derive the size of the screening sample per stratum. Based on the 1998 SSBF report, the screener completion rate, main interview eligibility rate, and main interview completion rate varied significantly across strata. We assumed that such variation was likely to continue in the 2003 survey and should be taken into account in determining the screening sample size. On the other hand, the nonresponse subsampling rate at both screener and main interview stages would remain constant across all strata. We now discuss how the various stratum-specific rates were estimated from the 1998 results., 38210=The target population of the study was headquarter locations1 of nongovernmental, nonfinancial, nonagricultural for-profit businesses with fewer than 500 employees. These firms also had to be in business at the time of data collection as well as during December 2003 under one or more of their current owners., 396279=Allowable response and range changes. Problems of this type were detected during interim data review and testing of training scenarios. Typically, this problem involved a response that was accepted by the CATI that should have been out of range. Several such changes were required with early versions of the CATI program. One such change was necessitated when the data collection period extended into 2005. At that time, NORC changed the date ranges of some questions, such as when the firm had most recently applied for a loan, and when the firm had become listed on a stock exchange, to allow for entries of 2005., 907062=Based on these results, there appears little to be gained from stratifying the 2003 SSBF sample by match and non-matches. However, since the sample design involves a variety of stratifications, NORC might still consider subsampling within a set of cells if there were sufficient differences between the matches and non-matches. Two possibilities would be to partition the SM matches and SM non-matches by employment size (0-19, 20-49, 50-99, and 100-499) and/or business type (sole proprietor, partnership, and corporation). The results in Table 6.38 through Table 6.42 show a familiar pattern: most subgroups of the SM non-match group have lower in-operation rates than their SM match counterparts, but the non-match SM subgroups nevertheless have high in-operation rates. Thus, we may not assume that any subgroup of the non-matches is largely comprised of enterprises that are not operating as a business., 136784=\u2022 Folder. A folder was used to contain all the materials sent as part of the worksheet mailing. The materials were inserted into the inside pockets of the folder. Minor updates were made to reflect changes since the 1998 survey; otherwise, the folder was unchanged from the 1998 survey. It was made from glossy card stock with a red, white and blue patriotic design. The SSBF logo and the SSBF web site address were on the front cover and the toll-free telephone number was printed on the back cover (see Appendix Z)., 6277=4.6.10 Unweighted Completion Rate 68, 4001=2.8 2003 SSBF QUESTIONNAIRE 24, 185330=A portion of main interview training focused on using the look-up function of branch names for depository institutions. The look-up function, used for the first time in the 2003 SSBF, could be administered up to eight times during subsection H of the questionnaire to attempt to pinpoint the exact office or branch used most often25 by respondents, and to capture the bank ID. Mastering the look-up function required knowing what questions to ask respondents and what searches to use to find a match. In training, respondents watched a trainer demonstrate the look-up function, and then were able to practice using it themselves during mock interviews., 54226=As in previous surveys, two instruments were prepared for 2003. The first was a short screening questionnaire (referred to as the \"screener\") that was used to establish contact with the firm, verify contact information (name and address), and establish firm eligibility. The screener was necessary because not all eligibility criteria were available from the sample frame, and because the frame data were sometimes incorrect. The second instrument was the main interview questionnaire, referred to as the \"questionnaire.\" The questionnaire was administered to firms whose eligibility status had been confirmed in the screener, either by a business owner or by a proxy., 6393=4.6.13 Nonresponse Follow-Up 71, 49898=Data preparation and delivery tasks began during the data collection period and were completed at the end of March 2005. Throughout data collection, periodic deliveries of the questionnaire data were sent to the FRB. Editing and coding activities spanned the data collection period and continued for about six weeks after data collection ended. The final data files, code books, and data documentation were sent to the FRB by March 31, 2005., 13408=Table 2.2 Key Questionnaire Changes from 1998 12, 468760=After completion of the data collection period (January 31, 2005), NORC began the final delivery process. The final delivery included all of the interim deliverables for all complete and partial interviews (both main and screener), plus the following items:, 460152=A batch of approximately the first half of the industry coding was sent to the FRB for review and comments on January 21, 2005. The second file, containing all of the coded data, was sent on February 23, 2005., 568392=Main Interview Completion Rate. Table 8.28 in The 1998 SSBF Methodology Report contains the main interview nonresponse adjustment factors for various subgroups defined by minority status, employment size, urban/rural status, type of industry, credit score range, and census division. Extensive cell collapsing was performed in 1998 within minority groups and across census divisions within non-minority groups, making it impossible to calculate the 1998 completion rate for subgroups corresponding to the 2003 strata. However, it was possible to examine the variation of main interview completion rates between urban and rural businesses and across size classes. Based on that examination, we computed the 1998 main interview completion rate for four groups of businesses. The 1998 group rates and the expected 2003 group rates are presented in Table 6.11, where and represent the main interview completion rate at pass 1 and pass 2, respectively. Again, the 1998 group rates were used to modify the overall main interview completion rates assumed for pass 1 and pass 2. For example, the first group (1-49, rural) achieved a main interview completion rate of .36 in 1998, which was 1.0909 times higher than the overall 1998 completion rate of .33. This ratio of 1.0909 was used to modify the overall completion rates assumed for pass 1 and pass 2 under each scenario. Thus, under scenario 1, the expected pass 1 completion rate was estimated as .40*1.0909=.44, and the expected pass 2 completion rate was estimated as .20*1.0909=.22. Expected main interview completion rates under the other two scenarios were derived in the same manner., 56636=This chapter first reviews the expert consultation and worksheet development, describes the two pretests, and then details the final phase of questionnaire development. The chapter ends with a brief description of the 2003 SSBF screener and questionnaire., 72835=In addition to these general changes, the most significant changes were a total revamping of the owner demographics section and the addition of an automated institution look-up procedure. The FRB redesigned the owner demographics and characteristics section (subsection C) to better match the U.S. Census Bureau's redesigned 2002 Survey of Business Owners. This was in part motivated by the Office of Management and Budget's guidelines regarding ethnicity and race information, which encourages agencies to collect information in a \"check all that apply\" format. Instead of collecting the ethnicity and racial information at the firm level, the redesign calls for collecting the information at the individual owner level. For the 2003 questionnaire, demographic data were collected on up to three owners/partners of corporations and partnerships compared to the majority owner and the firm as a whole in 1998. For sole proprietorships jointly owned by a husband and wife, the 2003 questionnaire collected demographics on both spouses. For any organizational type, if a single owner/partner/ shareholder owned more than 50% of the firm, data was only collected for that person., 6361=4.6.12 Nonresponse 71, 16880=Table 6.4 Nonrespondents and Finalized Nonrespondents/Noncontacts Among Pass 1 Screener Incompletes: Estimated from Table 6.6 in 1998 SSBF Methodology Report 134, 524060=Pass 1 Screener Completion Rate. The first important assumption is the screener completion rate at pass 1. All live businesses in the sample were considered eligible for the screening interview53. The screener completion rate is defined as the number of businesses that completed the screener as a proportion of the screening sample size. The screener completion rate of the 1998 survey was about 70%. However, the 2003 survey design involved subsampling of screener nonrespondents for further attempts in pass 2. As a result, the 2003 pass 1 cases were to be in the field for a shorter period of time than the 1998 sample, and the 2003 pass 1 screener completion rate was likely to be lower than the 1998 rate. We assumed three rates for the three scenarios: Scenario 1 (40%) represented the worst case, Scenario 2 (50%) represented an improved rate, and Scenario 3 (60%) represented the most optimistic assumptions., 310253=Call firms that did not return SAQ. Starting in January 2005, NORC's team of locators and refusal-converter interviewers began calling the nonrespondents that had not yet returned an SAQ. The original protocol was for interviewers to make up to 14 call attempts - two calls a day for two weeks - and to stop working a case after the first owner refusal. In reality NORC worked some cases well beyond the protocol, particularly in converting refusals. NORC called nonrespondents for approximately three weeks, through the end of January 2005., 547576=Within each size class, the number of complete interviews was further allocated to the 18 strata that make up each size class. As in the 1998 survey, the sample allocation to strata within each size class was accomplished through a raking routine. Raking, also known as iterative proportional fitting, is a technique for applying multiple marginal constraints through iteratively adjusting the size of individual cells that determine the marginal distributions. For the current application, the sample allocation to strata was constrained by the requirements that 1) each size class receives a fixed sample size and 2) the overall sample size is 4,000. The raking program started with an arbitrary allocation per stratum. These initial allocations were then adjusted iteratively, one dimension at a time, until all constraints were met., 570284=The estimated 2003 screener completion rate, main interview eligibility rate, and main interview completion rate were then used to replace the corresponding rates assumed for the overall sample. In doing so, the group rates were applied to all strata within that group. For example, the first group in Table 6.9 corresponds to strata 111 and 112. For these two strata, the expected screener completion rates were .36 and .27 for pass 1 and pass 2, respectively under Scenario 1. The first group in Table 6.10 corresponds to strata 111-119. For these 9 strata, the expected main interview eligibility rate was 0.68 under Scenario 1. Similarly, the first group in Table 6.11 corresponds to strata 111-119 and 211-219. For these 18 strata, the expected main interview completion rates were .39 and .19 for pass 1 and pass 2, respectively under Scenario 1., 74033=Another important change from 1998 was the addition of the automated look-up of depository institutions. The lookup function was added to improve the identification of financial institutions, minimize post-processing, and reduce the number of uncodable institutions. In previous rounds respondents often reported financial institution name and address data that were not sufficient to accurately determine geographic location, which is critical to market analysis. For 2003 the questionnaire included a link to a database of more than 100,000 U.S. depository institutions and branches. Working with respondents, interviewers searched this database to identify the exact location of institutions reported by respondents. Thanks in particular to the guidance of Dr. Mach during development and testing, NORC programmers delivered an effective look-up application that interviewers found easy to use., 634460=To determine the composition of batch 4, we analyzed the relative productivity of the 5 sample balancing groups in early October of 2004. There were three batches in the field at the time. However, only results from the first two batches were used in this analysis since batch 3 was too new to be reliable. The analysis showed that group productivity was similar although there seemed to be a small disparity among the groups. We measured group productivity by the number of complete interviews as a proportion of the total targeted number of interviews per group. Table 6.14 shows the total number of complete interviews from the first two batches, the total targeted number of complete interviews, and the number of complete interviews as a proportion of the target per sample balancing group as of the date of the evaluation., 37189=Since the 1998 survey, consolidation has continued in the banking industry; current data are needed to understand the impact of this consolidation on small business lending practices. Data from the 2003 SSBF will help researchers understand the ongoing impact of banking mergers and consolidations, as well as the continued rise in interstate banking. This data set, together with data collected for 1987, 1993, and 1998, will permit researchers to identify trends in the use of local and non-local banks, and non-bank institutions, and to identify any changes in the types of financial services used by small businesses, such as in credit card and trade credit use. The survey contains an expanded set of information on small businesses' recent borrowing experiences, which can be used to identify segments of the small business sector that have the most difficulty obtaining credit. The data from four points in time, taken together, will be a significant contribution to the body of knowledge in this area., 50834=At the close of data collection, 13,864 firms completed the screening interview, from the 23,798 initially released for screening. There were an additional 197 cases that were determined to be ineligible, although the screening interview was not administered. Of the 14,061 firms where eligibility was determined, 9,687 (69%) met the eligibility criteria for the study. This was a decrease from 1998, when 73% of the screened firms were eligible. The final raw screener completion rate3 was 59% compared to 69% complete in the 1998 survey. The final 2003 sample consisted of 4,268 firms with completed interviews and a weighted overall response rate of 32.4%4. Complete details on the preparation for and experiences of data collection, in addition to the survey outcomes, can be found in Chapters 3 and 4. More information on survey response can be found in Section 6.10., 17758=Table 6.11 Expected 2003 Main Interview Completion Rates by Group: Estimated from Table 8.28 in the 1998 SSBF Methodology Report 143, 146462=NORC began recruiting SSBF telephone interviewers in February 2004. The first phase was to hire interviewers for pretests one and two. The second and larger phase was to hire interviewers for the main study. NORC's goals were for all SSBF interviewers to: 1) exhibit all of the qualities of good telephone interviewers; 2) gain respondent cooperation; 3) conduct the interview accurately; 4) adhere to all research protocols for the study; 5) demonstrate numerical literacy; 6) have an understanding of the financial and accounting terms used in the main interview; and 7) meet the productivity expectations of the telephone operations center., 3950=2.7 2003 SSBF SCREENER 23, 249567=By the beginning of January, 2005, newly screened eligible batch four cases had four weeks or less to complete the main interview - much less time than was given to respondents in the first three sample batches to complete the main interview. NORC was challenged to shorten the interval in which respondents were able complete their worksheet, assemble tax forms and financial records for their firm's 2003 fiscal year34, and find time to complete a telephone interview that could exceed an hour. Accordingly NORC made two changes to its screening protocol beginning in January:, 262600=Finding firms is a challenge of business surveys. Firms quietly go out of business. They change their names. They move headquarters, they merge with other firms, and they get purchased outright. For smaller firms in particular, the churn of dynamic capitalism often leaves little tangible documentation in its wake. For these reasons, many firms were not easily or quickly located from their sample information. For the 2003 SSBF, screener cases were sent to locating if:, 270728=The vast majority of CATI changes were made prior to data collection. Inevitably, however, issues were discovered that required changes to the CATI after data collection started. On June 23, 2004, NORC put a new version of the screener CATI into production. The primary fix enabled interviewers to continue calling cases after three call attempts. Before the fix, on the fourth call to a case, CATI was programmed to go the Suspend screen, terminating the call. On October 6, 2004, another version went into production that corrected the criteria for eligibility flags 4 and 6 to include don't know and refused responses to question A9_2, \"Was [STREET ADDRESS] ever the firm's headquarters, or ever a branch location?\", 533764=Screener Eligibility Rate among Pass 2 Incompletes. In order to compute the weighted screener completion rate, it was also necessary to estimate the screener eligibility rate among pass 2 incompletes, i.e., the proportion of live businesses among pass 2 screener incompletes. Again, we derived this estimate from the 1998 5% follow-up sample. Based on our definition, the 1998 5% follow-up sample included 374 screener nonrespondents. NORC was able to establish contact with 334 (89%) of these nonrespondents. If a contact may be considered as evidence that the business was still in operation, then this contact rate provided a reasonable estimate of the proportion of live businesses among the nonrespondents. We used this rate as the proportion of live businesses among pass 2 screener incompletes. Table 6.6 lists the types of cases in the 1998 5% sample that were considered nonrespondents., 247997=At two intervention points, NORC reviewed pending batch-four screening cases to determine which ones were ready to receive a refusal conversion letter. The first point was four weeks after screening began; in the first week of December, nearly 1,000 batch four refusal cases were sent a conversion letter via Federal Express and recontacted three days later. Eight weeks after screening, an additional 334 refusal cases were sent conversion letters and recontacted several days later., 752244=\u2022 Businesses not in operation on December 31, 2003 or/and the date of the interview., 71680=In 1998, NORC programmed CATI to translate numeric dollar amounts that had been entered by interviewers into words that interviewers were to read back to respondents to verify that the dollar amounts had been captured accurately. Large dollar amounts are often expressed using verbal \"short-hand\" such as \"one million six.\" Such expressions are subject to misinterpretation by interviewers. This example could be understood to mean \"$1,600,000\" or it might be more literally interpreted to mean \"$1,000,006\" which is unlikely to be correct. Dollar amounts with many zeros are also subject to keystroke error. In 1998, the procedure for reading back amounts after they had been programmatically translated into words was applied to only a subset of the dollar amount items in the questionnaire. In 2003, this procedure was applied to all dollar amount items. Despite pressure from respondents to complete the interview as quickly as possible, interviewers were instructed that adherence to this procedure was critically important to ensure data quality, and this was strictly enforced through monitoring., 466442=\u2022 War and September 11th., 473123=In sum, the 2003 SSBF design involved four major components: the selection of the initial sample, the subsampling of screener nonrespondents, the subsampling of main interview nonrespondents, and an additional follow-up sample of screener incompletes. Figure 6.1 describes the entire sampling process., 474698=The remainder of this chapter describes the sampling methodology and weighting procedures in greater detail. Section 6.2 defines the target population of the 2003 survey. Section 6.3 discusses the construction of the sampling frame from the DMI file. Section 6.4 presents the sample stratification scheme. Section 6.5 illustrates how the screening sample size was determined based on assumptions regarding rates of eligibility, completion, and nonresponse subsampling. Section 6.6 describes the procedures for assigning the sample to batches and replicates. Section 6.7 presents an analysis of nonresponse subsampling and its impact on design effects. Section 6.8 discusses the selection of the five percent follow-up sample of screener incompletes. Section 6.9 describes the procedures of calculating the final analysis weights. Section 6.10 discusses the calculation of the response rates. Finally, Section 6.11 explains where actual implementation of the sampling methodology differed from the NORC sampling plan, including a detailed look at InfoUSA matching., 526165=Proportion of Pass 1 Screener Incompletes Eligible for Subsampling. According to the sample design, sample businesses that failed to complete the screener at pass 1 would be divided into two groups for subsampling purposes: nonrespondents and finalized nonrespondents/noncontacts. The former category was eligible for subsampling while the latter was not. The nonrespondents were businesses that did not complete the screener but with which a human contact or other promising contact was established during the field period. All other incompletes were either finalized nonrespondents or noncontacts, including disconnected numbers, computer/fax numbers, fast busy signals, hostile refusals, language barriers, locating problems, unavailable during the field period, or incapacitated. Based on this definition, nonrespondents accounted for 59% of all screener incompletes in 1998. The remaining 41% of screener incompletes were finalized nonrespondents/noncontacts. Table 6.4 shows how this breakdown was estimated from the 1998 results., 273773=\u2022 Cases confirmed by locators to be currently out of business or not in business as of December 2003., 467333=NORC delivered screener and main data on a staggered schedule, originally biweekly so that main data and screener data were delivered on alternating weeks. In early September 2004, the FRB agreed to move screener deliveries to a monthly schedule (every 4 weeks) rather than biweekly. The delivery schedule was altered to accommodate holidays and staff vacations when necessary. Please see Appendix BBB for the interim delivery schedule., 248493=NORC continued batch four screening until it yielded a number of screened cases comparable to the yields of batches one through three. NORC had calculated the size of sample batch four, based on data from the previous batches, to yield enough completed screeners to reach the goal of 4,000 completed interviews. Batch four screening ended on January 21, after which time interviewers worked on main interviews for the duration of data collection., 476013=The 2003 SSBF target population included U.S. businesses that met the following criteria:, 533327=Pass 2 Screener Completion Rate. The next important parameter is the pass 2 screener completion rate where we had no guidance from the 1998 survey. We assumed that the pass 2 rate would be lower than the pass 1 rate since the pass 2 sample would include more difficult cases. As shown in Table 6.3, we assumed the pass 2 screener completion rates to be 30%, 35%, and 40% for the three scenarios respectively., 70861=Two general changes from 1998 were a change in the reference period for some questions and the automated read back in words of dollar amounts. In 1998, the reference period for all questions was the latest fiscal year or fiscal year end. For some firms, this meant that data on account balances and loans outstanding, for example, would have to be obtained from records that were as much as 18 months old. In 1998, it appeared that many firms instead reported amounts and other data as of the interview date. Consequently, the reference period in 2003 was changed to the date of the interview (or the last statement date in the case of checking accounts and loans). Since the balance sheet and income data were tied closely to tax forms, the reference period for these items remained the latest fiscal year., 308674=Send Federal Express packages. On December 13, 2004, all 201 nonrespondents were sent a package by standard overnight Federal Express containing the following materials:, 144087=NORC established two email addresses for SSBF: 2003-SSBF@norc.uchicago.edu and cemmons@norc.net22 for respondents to use if that was the business' preferred method of communicating questions or information. The second address was based on the name of the SSBF project director at the start of the study, and appeared on all letters sent by the project director, including refusal conversion letters. The first address appeared at the top of worksheets. The accounts received very few inquiries, until the time NORC started following delivery of main-interview conversion letters with email reminders. The responses to these email follow-up messages are discussed in Section 4.7.3.4., 463551=A batch of approximately the first half of the race coding was sent to the FRB for review and comments on December 10, 2004, at which point NORC proposed the three additions to the code frame described above. The FRB approved of the code frame additions and provided feedback that was used in preparing the final (cumulative) batch of race coding, which was delivered on February 26, 2005. In total, NORC coded 283 verbatim responses of \"Other\" races., 25402=Appendix DD. 2003 SSBF Homepage at the FRB Website, 99065=Details about the two pretest instruments, respondent materials, survey processes and protocols, and debriefings are included in The 2003 Survey of Small Business Finances Pretest I Report and The 2003 Survey of Small Business Finances Pretest II Report. These reports were delivered to the FRB in May and October 2004, respectively. Notes from the interviewer debriefing following pretest one can be found in Appendix A., 551174=These 1998 screener completion rates were used to estimate the expected screener completion rate per group for the 2003 survey. However, the 1998 rates were not used directly as the expected completion rates in 2003. Instead, they were used to modify the overall completion rates assumed for pass 1 and pass 2 under each scenario. The estimated 2003 rates were derived through the following steps. First, the ratio of the 1998 group rate to the overall rate was computed for each group. For the first group (1-19, rural, and region 1), the ratio was (.73/.70)= 1.0429. Second, this ratio was used to modify the assumed overall screener completion rate for 2003 to derive the group-specific rate. For example, under Scenario 1, the assumed screener completion rates were .40 and .30 for pass 1 and pass 2, respectively (see Table 6.3). The expected 2003 screener completion rate for the first group for pass 1 under scenario 1 was estimated as .40*1.0429=.42, and the pass 2 rate was estimated as .30*1.0429=.31. The expected 2003 screener completion rates for the other groups under each scenario were derived following the same procedures., 948840=The SSBF collects complex, detailed financial information, as well as many other details about ownership and business practices. Small business owners represent a wide variety of backgrounds and have varying levels of familiarity with the concepts and terminology used during the interview. For these reasons, NORC planned to employ a well-informed and highly trained staff of interviewers who would be able to gain respondent cooperation, answer respondent questions, explain the intent of complicated questions and questions that require specialized knowledge to answer, and collect high quality data. To address shortcomings identified in previous iterations of this survey, NORC attempted in the 2003 survey to first determine the characteristics of effective SSBF interviewers, and then develop a recruiting plan to find them., 459675=In total, NORC coded 1572 verbatim responses into the 4-digit SIC code frame. 728 of the verbatim responses were found to not be significantly different from their preloaded value, and were thus coded back to that original SIC code. 53 items were deemed uncodable (usually because they were too vague or otherwise incomprehensible). The remaining 791 items were assigned a new SIC code to match the new industry as described by the respondent in the verbatim entry., 24194=Appendix J. Press Release for the 2003 SSBF, 976528=NORC has not studied the data extensively, but anecdotally, there appeared to be an increase in willingness to cooperate at the $200 level if respondents were not initially cooperative. NORC moved to $500 over the holiday season because the end of the study was approaching and interviewers began recontacting some of the oldest cases. For cases that had been cooling off for a significant amount of time, i.e., from batches one, two, and three, the $500 offer was a successful incentive. NORC was able to complete almost 300 more cases than it had planned between December 6, 2004 and January 1, 2005 and believes that the high incentives of $200 and $500 were a major contributor to its ability to accomplish this. Whether $300 or $400 would have had the same effect as $500 is unknown. However, the next round of the study should provide sufficient funding to pay incentives higher than the equivalent of $50., 258321=The screener refusal mailing changed for batch four. Batch four started in early November. Due to the holiday season, NORC was concerned that the previous configurations - a mix of letters and other materials sent by 1st-class mail - would get lost in the volume of holiday-period mail. The 1st-class No. 10 envelope and its contents were replaced by an overnight Federal Express envelope containing only a personalized refusal-conversion letter from the project director (PD)., 738701=The 2003 SSBF attempted screener interviews with 23,798 firms in four batches. The main interview eligibility status was determined for 14,061 firms, of which 9,687 were found to be eligible. The interviewers were able to complete the main interview with 4,268 firms and these firms formed the final SSBF analysis sample. A final analysis weight was calculated for each complete case to support weighted estimation. The primary purpose of the weights was to correct for potential bias due to unequal selection probabilities and nonresponse. A secondary purpose was to compensate for ineligible businesses that were part of the original sample. Informally, the sum of the analysis weights of responding firms approximate the total number of firms in the target population., 296168=\u2022 The firm size, including employees and working owners, during a typical pay period in 2003, 16757=Table 6.2 2003 SSBF Sample Stratification 127, 472251=One of the important goals of the 2003 survey was to increase the overall response rate. To achieve that goal, the sample design included extensive nonresponse subsampling. Nonrespondents to the screening interview were subsampled for further screening attempts to improve the screener completion rate. The intent of the subsampling was to allow the interviewers to concentrate more intensive efforts on a subsample of the more difficult cases, ultimately leading to more completed cases. Nonrespondents to the main interview were also subsampled48., 132085=\u2022 Results brochure. This brochure was included in the worksheet mailing (Appendix Q). It was revised from the 1998 \"Important Facts\" brochure to make a more powerful cooperation-gaining tool. NORC deleted bullet points describing the study's purpose; this information was available from other materials in the worksheet mailing. NORC added narrative text to provide context for the statistics presented. The text discussed changes in the business environment since 1998, reinforcing the need to update the 1998 data with another round of research. The brochure provided the following results from the 1998 SSBF: 1) selected characteristics of small businesses and their owners; 2) the most important problems facing small businesses; 3) credit and borrowing activities; and 4) where small businesses went for financial services. By presenting summary percentages from the 1998 survey in this manner, NORC hoped to show by example how the 2003 data would be used, and how these uses did not involve release of identifying information., 78515=CATI testing began in March, before the first pretest, and continued into December for changes made during the main data collection. The testing protocol followed these general steps:, 25344=Appendix CC. 2003 SSBF Homepage at NORC Website, 47083=Within a few days of receiving the mailing, businesses were called and asked to complete the screener. To ensure that interviewers reached the most knowledgeable screener respondent, the initial conversation with the person at the firm who answered the telephone call was fully scripted for the 2003 survey. A protocol was developed to ensure that at least three attempts were made to speak with owner, before accepting screener responses from a knowledgeable proxy., 229572=NORC had initially estimated that screening would require 0.5 hours per case, calculated by dividing total interviewer time spent screening by the number of completed screeners. The increase to 1.1 hours per case could be due to several factors. While questions about the firm's owner's race and ethnicity were removed from the screener because minority oversampling was dropped for the 2003 survey, other factors may have contributed to the increased administration time:, 299397=Mailings were sent to firms' preloaded address, or to the most current address for the firm at the end of pass one locating. The letter explained the purpose of the study and asked the recipient to complete and return the SAQ by January 21, 2005. The letter mentioned that NORC would send $25 as a token of appreciation to anyone who returned the completed questionnaire. The SAQ was identical to the version developed for nonrespondents (see below)., 128883=\u2022 Letters from the project director. NORC prepared two letters from the project director for 2003. The first was for the advance (pre-screening) mailing (Appendix K). The 2003 advance letter was slightly shorter and used a larger font than in 1998. Each main paragraph began with a summary statement in bold text. The redesign was intended to make the letter more readable. With the summary statements, NORC hoped that respondents who only skimmed the letter would still recall the main points - and would be expecting a telephone call from NORC. The letter was personalized and included logos for NORC and the 2003 SSBF. In addition, the official Federal Reserve Board logo was used on the envelope to further promote the legitimacy of the study. (An image of the envelope with the logo is found in Appendix L.), 20565=Figure 6.1 2003 SSBF Sampling Flowchart 123, 334943=Main interviewing for batch four started in the first week of November and continued through January 2005. To fully exploit the shorter, 13-week schedule, NORC conducted a rolling wave of more intensive interviewing concurrent with the first wave. Cases still pending four weeks after their worksheet mailing date moved into the rolling wave. Each week for five weeks, starting on December 1 and ending on December 29, main batch four pending cases were rolled into the more intensive interviewing, which started with the shipment of a conversion letter that mentioned a $200 financial incentive via Federal Express. The protocol for the more intensive working of batch four cases was similar to the protocol employed in pass two for the first three batches., 525132=Main Interview Eligibility Rate. The second important assumption was the main interview eligibility rate among completed screeners. This eligibility rate is defined as the number of businesses that are eligible for the main interview as a proportion of all businesses that complete the screener. In 1998, 73% of the businesses that completed the screener were eligible for the main interview (see The 1998 SSBF Methodology Report, page 58). We assumed that the eligibility rate for this round might be as low as 65% due to stricter eligibility criteria. To be eligible for the 1998 SSBF, a business had to be in operation at the end of 1998. To be eligible for the 2003 SSBF, however, a business should have been in operation at the end of 2003 and at the time of the main interview. The expected decline in eligibility rate assumes that about 1% of small businesses go out of business each month. The same eligibility rate is assumed for businesses in both pass 1 and pass 2 of the screening interviews., 315650=Despite higher average administration times than expected, hours per completed case (HPC) for main interviewing were lower than expected. Many factors may have contributed to the decline in HPC from 1998, including improvements since the 1998 survey in the caliber of interviewers, the content of interviewer training, and the quality of the respondent contact materials. The most significant contribution may have been derived from the shorter interval between screening and interviewing. In 2003, interviewers were able to build on the rapport they had established during screening when recontacting respondents to complete the main approximately one week later., 126194=First we decided on standard logos that would be used on all materials, making them easily identifiable with the project. NORC prepared two project logos for the 2003 survey, both based on the 1998 project logo. One logo, with no reference to year, appeared only on worksheets. The reference to year was removed to allow respondents to focus on the definition of the fiscal year without distraction. The other version, in which 1998 was replaced by 2003, was used on other materials including the worksheet mailing folder, the letterhead for letters to respondents, and the General Information and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) brochures. Word graphics of the two SSBF logos can be found in Appendix F., 340167=In order to keep interviewers working sufficient hours over the holiday season (Thanksgiving to New Year's), NORC initiated an incentive program to encourage interviewers to work more hours. The program, which started in the first week of November, paid a $5-per-hour bonus to interviewers who worked more than 30 hours a week. The program increased average hours per week per interviewer (see Table 4.21). After declining through October, total interviewer hours and average hours per interviewer jumped sharply in November and into December. Average hours per interviewer remained high, although total interviewer hours declined again over the Christmas and New Year's holiday period., 658837=Due to the uncertainty surrounding eligibility and completion rates, the batches were not all drawn at the same time. The first two batches, consisting of 5,666 businesses each, were selected from the initial sample of 37,600 businesses. Initially 11,332 businesses were drawn simultaneously from the original sample of 37,600 businesses. They were assigned to either batch 1 or batch 2 systematically. Before batch 1 and batch 2 results could be analyzed fully, batch 3 was drawn. Batch 3 consisted of 5,666 businesses from the remaining sample of 26,268 businesses. Batch 3 had the same composition as previous two batches. Following the analysis of batch 1 and 2 results, the final batch was drawn. Batch 4 consisted of 6,800 businesses from the remaining 20,602 businesses. Similarly, batch 4 had the same composition as the previous three batches. The remaining 13,802 cases were placed in the reserve sample that was never needed in the 2003 SSBF., 17227=Table 6.6 Screener Eligibility Rate Among Pass 2 Nonrespondents: Established From Table 8.18 in the 1998 SSBF Methodology Report 135}",

Introduction While data on small businesses exist from a variety of sources, no source provides detailed information on the finances of small businesses and their use of credit from all sources. In 1987, 1993, and 1998, small businesses were surveyed about their finances on behalf of the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) in order to provide a nationally representative sample of the aforementioned information. These surveys provided information on small businesses' income, expenses, assets, liabilities, characteristics of the firm and firm owners, in addition to characteristics of small businesses' financial relationships with financial service suppliers for a broad set of financial products and services.
