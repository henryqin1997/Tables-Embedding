Probably it won't be a problem, if you find a smarter way to rearrange the contents, do it! Another plus of maintaining a such register is that a quick glimpse at it gives the current picture about internationalization of various documents. In order to minimize this kind of hostile and *non*-DRY situations it could be a good idea to track translator's movements using some sort of mechanism, and this page could be a solution. potentially everyone can take some chapter and start new translations self-directed, so the risk of duplicate efforts is very concrete (think of different people that, being unaware of this, are working on the same document providing different and separate outputs). I know that some people have already started to translate some documents, but I don't know which ones and their status; in translation process some sort of harmony and coordination is IMO desirable; This page is meant to be kept up-to-date by members of the translation teams and maintainers and exists for some simple facts: We have had a lot of beautiful documents about Django, and even more noticeable they are updated as quickly as possible to reflect changes in code: let's",
