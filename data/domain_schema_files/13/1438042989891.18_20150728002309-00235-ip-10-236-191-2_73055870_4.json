(In my memory he reached level 23 but everybody says that is impossible so it must have been level 22) This happened in Tilburg, Netherlands(gameroom: 26). In my oppinion he still holds the World record. He never played the game again because of disappointment of this death level., 148674=IMPORTANT: In March 2014, Twin Galaxies\u2014which disappeared for several months after the Kong Off 3 in November 2013\u2014re-emerged with a new owner, Jace Hall. The organization has been in the midst of a long restructuring period and has just recently (January 2015) finally begun accepting score submissions again. Bear with them! Please see this post for background., 150478=Neither Steve Wiebe nor Billy Mitchell hold the Donkey Kong world record anymore, though both are still highly revered. Wiebe remains active and a serious force to be reckoned with, particularly in live events like the recent Kong Offs. While he has not had the time or inclination to pursue the world record since 2010, most of today's top players agree that Wiebe has the potential to reclaim it. Mitchell, on the other hand, is no longer competing., 148766=This leaderboard was last maintained on June 25th, 2015., 134270=A note on world records: The Donkey Kong world record as it is known and recognized by Twin Galaxies, Guinness, other score-trackers, the media, the general public, and purists/traditionalists can only be set on an original 1981 arcade machine. Hence, Robbie Lakeman is the reigning world champion, even though Dean Saglio's MAME Arcade Machine Emulator score is higher than Lakeman's arcade score., 94162=I have a quick question i have a 60 in 1 arcade machine it has a small computer chip that runs 60 games would this be consider a MAME style of play even though it has a the classic arcade conrtols and body style? thnx also ive been playing since march 7th 2013 and my best score is 214,600 on lvl 7 is that good, 149909=In 2010, the world record was taken by Dr. Hank Chien, a plastic surgeon from New York City. Mitchell reclaimed it that year, with Wiebe then taking it from Mitchell, but Chien soon beat both and held the record for almost four years (and through a couple of very close calls) until he was finally dethroned by Robbie Lakeman in September 2014., 90382=Thanks Chrispy i have gotten a score of 287,300 since then but ive been practicing point pressing and it is difficult. I live 35 minutes from Funspot and been playing there at least twice a week the original game has a better joystick then mine. They have a classic arcade tournement the first week of june from thursday to sunday i hope to see some top cuntenders there, steve weibe was there a month ago but i didnt get to see him he did a random pop in when he was on vacation with his family in maine. But i hope to get alot better by then but who knows thanks again and if anyone is going to funspot in june hit me up on this post my name is roger champagne and could always use some pointers from the pros., 115196=Ive had my machine since May and Im in the 480,000 range for my high score. For you experienced players, is this decent progression?, 151850=Presented for your information and adulation: the official top 20 Donkey Kong scores, as tracked/verified by Twin Galaxies International (from 1982-present), with additions from the community of experts and top players at Donkey Kong Forum (since 2013)., 119708=Interesting fact: NES Tetris scores are highly analagous to DK scores.

Hence, Robbie Lakeman is the reigning world champion, even though Dean Saglio's MAME Arcade Machine Emulator score is higher than Lakeman's arcade score. Some maintain an alternate view that since the game is emulated 100% accurately on MAME, the record should be whatever the highest score is, irrespective of platform. This view would see Saglio as the champ, with Lakeman in 2nd. Without delving into the particulars of the debate, let it be sufficient to note that there are strong cases for both positions. For neutrality's sake, the two records are treated here as parallel entities, or perhaps a split title, with neither being ranked as \"1st\" or \"2nd\", and the rankings from there on starting at 3rd place. This solution honors the traditional perception of the world record being necessarily tied to the original arcade hardware (and Lakeman's publicly-recognized status as the Donkey Kong champion), while also respecting the fact that Saglio has technically achieved the highest score.",
