    "textBeforeTable": "The Three Lions, who suffered a difficult first day, reached stumps on 302-5 as the batsmen found their groove. England smashed through the Australian lower order to set themselves a first innings target of 304, a number they are likely to pass within the first over of the third day. England trail an Australia Invitational XI by two runs with five wickets remaining at the close of play on the second day in Sydney.
