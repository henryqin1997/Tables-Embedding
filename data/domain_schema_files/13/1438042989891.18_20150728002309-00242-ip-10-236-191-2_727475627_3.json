The first ever 26 mile marathon distance SUP event in the UK was held at Brighton on 8 th July as part\u00a0of the fantastic annual Paddle Round the Pier free beach festival. Conditions were looking ok with the wind gusting up to around 12knots, a\u00a0basic 3 lap course was laid and we were in the water and off by 9am. Ryan James (14') got\u00a0off to a good start and pulled away into a convincing early lead, myself (12.6), James Hardy\u00a0(14') and Shaun Taylor (14') jostled for positions on the first upwind leg with Nick Healey\u00a0(12.6), Charlie Grey (12.6) and Rich Moreton (12.6) following. Mark Slater and Ryan James. The downwind leg of the first lap saw James & Shaun pull ahead of me, but after completing\u00a0lap 1, I stayed closer inshore for the next upwind section, as did Nick & Charlie and we\u00a0managed to pull quite a bit of ground back and I rounded the upwind bouy 2nd behind Ryan. Unfortunately Shaun had problems with the rudder system on his board and had to pull out.\u00a0I found it very hard both mentally and physically starting the 3rd lap, we were all having\u00a0to start digging deep into our reserves now.
