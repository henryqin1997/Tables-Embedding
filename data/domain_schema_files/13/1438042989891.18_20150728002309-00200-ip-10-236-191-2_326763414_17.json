If you miss out on something you really wanted just resubmit another email request and we apologize for the inconvenience. Our In-stock Alerts only send one time for each item requested so that you don't receive a flood of e-mails for the same request. If you would like to delete any of your requests simply log into \"my account\" and edit your list. Because the species and size variations come available at different times, emails are sent out for each item separately to give our customers notice asap. Thank you for participating, we hope we can provide everything you are looking for. \u00a0",
