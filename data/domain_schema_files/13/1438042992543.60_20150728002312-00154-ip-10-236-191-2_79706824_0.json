The current version 1.99.3.1 of OSELAS.Toolchain() contains support for arm, x86, avr, mips and PowerPC. In addition, there are toolchains for bare metal platforms like Cortex-M3 and AVR-8-Bit. OSELAS.Toolchain() Crossdev is a project sponsored by Timesys, completely unrelated to the Gentoo cross toolchain generation system. The projects main focus is on a tool called tsrpm which is used to build cross development toolchains and generate cross-compiled software packages. Currently only x86 and select PowerPC architectures are supported. Link: Crossdev Crossdev/tsrpm (Timesys) Crosstool-NG is a well-maintained fork of crosstool, targeted at easier configuration, re-factored code, and a learning base on how toolchains are built, with support for both uClibc and glibc, for debug tools (gdb, strace, dmalloc...), and a wide range of versions for each tools. Different target architectures are supported as well. It offers a kernel-like configuration system to select the different configuration options of the toolchain (component versions, component configuration, etc.). Crosstool-NG has an active and responsive user and developer community. Crosstool-NG Crosstool is probably the first publicly-released script which downloads source tar-balls and builds simple gcc/glibc cross toolchains. Originally written by Dan Kegel, it only supported glibc toolchains, and is now unmaintained. Crosstool Crossdev is specific to",
