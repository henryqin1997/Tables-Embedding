    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{55431=USA Baseball will select its Collegiate National Team based on its Professional Teams selection model. The player pool will primarily be comprised of non-draft-eligible college players. Under certain and rare circumstances, draft-eligible players and players under control with one of the 30 Major League Baseball clubs may be considered for selection to the team. Trials will no longer be utilized to select the team. Players will be named to the 24-man roster on data from 2013 and/or the 2014 college baseball season. A selection committee will be formed to select players for training camp. The 2014 USA Baseball Collegiate National Team field manager, three coaches and one former athlete from past USA Baseball National Team programs will form the committee (other members may also be added to the committee). The director of the Collegiate National Team program will assist the committee by providing statistical information and selection notifications and will serve as the committee's moderator., 57690=Players from the 2013 USA Baseball Collegiate National Team and players with extraordinary results in the 2013 collegiate wood-bat summer leagues may begin to receive conditional invitations to the 24-man roster as early as February 2014., 58559=Contact Eric Campbell, General Manager, USA Baseball National Teams, with any questions regarding the 2014 USA Baseball Collegiate National Team selection process., 22748=* Available to Team USA from July 1-6 for 26-man roster, 57946=Players can be nominated to USA Baseball at any time by any individual. USA Baseball will work closely with college baseball coaching staffs and college baseball sports information directors to identify players who should be considered for the Collegiate National Team. The working watch list for team selection will be collaboration between the selection committee, USA Baseball program directors, the professional scouting community and the college baseball coaching community. The 2014 USA Baseball Collegiate National Team will assemble on June 19, and the team will embark on a 39-day tour., 57322=Beginning in 2013, the USA Baseball Collegiate National Team adopted a 24-man roster (12 position players, 12 pitchers). The selection committee may stop selection to the 24-man at a non-binding number and thus give more and better opportunities for alternate players to earn a spot on the final roster during the first 10 days of the tour, June 19-29., 63736=\u00a9 2001- USABaseball.com All rights reserved., 56453=The selection committee will first meet as early as December 2013 and will continue to meet throughout the college baseball season, with a final meeting on or around June 11, 2014. The selection committee will continue to follow the college season through the end of the NCAA Division I College World Series. Because the 2014 USA Baseball Collegiate National Team will assemble on June 19, 2014, additional players (alternates) will be selected to the team in the absence of players on the 24-man roster who are competing in Omaha for a national championship. Players who have exhausted their age-specific eligibility to the 18U program from the 2012 18U National Team will also be in the candidate pool to replace players competing in the College World Series. June 29 will be the last day to report to the 2014 USA Baseball Collegiate National Team.}",
