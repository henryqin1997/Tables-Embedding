However, the last team to beat them on a Monday night was\u0085\u0085\u0085.Chelsea, when we won 2-1 back in December 2011. 5 - With reference to Chelsea`s form in Monday night fixtures, 5 of our last 8 fixtures have ended in draws with 3 ending 0-0. 6 - City are in fine form at the Etihad Stadium having won the last 11 fixtures in a row.
