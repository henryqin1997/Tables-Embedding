The two dominant Horde guilds, DarkStorm and The Forgotten Few (TFF), collaborated and raided together tackling encounter after encounter with no notable competition, whilst The Void followed closely behind snapping up all of the guild-only kills. The combined guild raid force, using noggenfogger pot spam, killed Ragnaros on May 18, 2005 (Movie). It wouldn't be until 2 months later on July 22nd that their kill was followed by Stature of the Gods, closely followed by Midnight Reveries and The Void., 18311=The opening of the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj was a well coordinated serverwide event on Al'Akir. The dedicated pages to view progress on the war supplies gathering and cross faction trading of materials resulted in Al'Akir being the 7th server in Europe to open the gates on February 17, 2006., 16226=Eventually, the first legit Alliance Razorgore kill came from SotG. Both DS and SotG were hammering on the next boss, Vaelastrasz, night after night (for an hour tops, as that was how the Vaelastrasz fight worked in those days). This eventually resulted in a turning point in server history: the first time an alliance guild achieved a server first, as it was SotG that killed Vaelastrasz on August 29, 2005 (Movie). DS was quick to follow though and killed Vaelastrasz soon after, followed by a server-first on Broodlord Lashlayer that same night. It would be their last achievement in Blackwing Lair, since SotG killed Firemaw, then steamrolled over Ebonroc, Flamegor and Chromaggus in one night and eventually downed the final boss Nefarian. It would take considerable time, due to various internal issues, for DS to follow., 25251=SotG killed Sapphiron first, on Sunday October 22, and proved to be more then ready to face Kel'Thuzad, as they downed the chief lieutenant of the powerful Lich King just 2 days later on Tuesday October 24 as the 15th guild in Europe. DS followed their footsteps by killing Sapphiron 1 week after SotG and killing Kel'Thuzad 3 weeks after SotG as the 25th guild in Europe., 25703=With Christmas time (anno 2006) constantly getting closer both MR and DoV realised they couldn't gather the strengh anymore to kill Kel'Thuzad alone. The leadership of both guilds therefor agreed to create a raid alliance with the aim to kill Kel'Thuzad before The Burning Crusades arrival. Within the first week they managed to down The Four Horsemen, Friday December 22, and just 4 days later Sapphiron shared the same faith, Tuesday December 26th. Happy about the impressive progression they kept the raid alliance going and suceeded their aim by killing Kel'Thuzad late night, Sunday January 7th (Even thou some think it was Monday January 8th).}",
