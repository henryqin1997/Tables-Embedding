    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{2463=Lee, 35, is the senior member in the group of lefties on the market. He's made only two starts since spending more than two months on the DL with a flexor strain in his elbow, so he's more likely to be a trade consideration in August, when the waiver situation comes into play. He's due $25 million next year and has a $12.5 million buyout of his contract for 2016. That season could cost a team $27.5 million if he pitches 200 innings in '15, triggering a vesting option., 3416=Price, by contrast, has one final arbitration season in 2015 before reaching the free-agent market. He could seek more than $15 million for next season -- although most teams interested in him consider it a plus that they'll have him next year, not just this season. At this point, that's probably moot, as Price is giving Tampa Bay a chance to win. He could still be traded in the offseason, when teams not currently in contention (the Cubs, for instance) could join the bidding., 3862=Lester, 30, has been a bargain for the Red Sox. He's in his sixth and final season of control in a deal that pays him a total of $43 million, including the $13 million option for 2014 that Boston exercised after he outpitched Adam Wainwright in the World Series last October. A team trading for him at this point would owe him only a little more than $4.2 million., 1297=Don't completely overlook the Cubs in these considerations. They're always looking for some pitching to go with their collection of young hitters, and Hamels, Lester or Price (if he was available) would definitely jump-start their efforts to field a perennial contender. They've been expected to make a splash in free agency but a trade for Hamels could forestall that need. However, if they were going to trade a top prospect they would be more likely to seek a pitcher entering his prime, as Josh Beckett was when Boston acquired him for Hanley Ramirez in 2005., 4753=Lester and Price have been among the hottest pitchers in the Majors this summer, continuing to roll out impressive starts after many others have begun to show wear and tear. Lester is 5-1 with a 1.54 ERA since June 1; Price is 7-3 with a 1.82 ERA in that span., 6697=It wasn't the kind of war between left-handers that Lester and White Sox ace Chris Sale had engaged in back in April, when they both took no-hitters into the sixth inning, but it was a good showing by Price and Lester. The notes taken by dozens of scouts on hand will do nothing to slow interest in either of them as the non-waiver Trade Deadline approaches on Thursday at 4 p.m. ET., 5456=Tampa Bay has gone 19-5 since splitting a doubleheader in Baltimore on June 27, and it has caught the pack in the race for the American League's second Wild Card spot. It will be surprising if Rays president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman pulls the plug on the comeback with a Price trade, which could be a major advantage for the Red Sox and the Phillies.}",

Don't completely overlook the Cubs in these considerations. They're always looking for some pitching to go with their collection of young hitters, and Hamels, Lester or Price (if he was available) would definitely jump-start their efforts to field a perennial contender. They've been expected to make a splash in free agency but a trade for Hamels could forestall that need. However, if they were going to trade a top prospect they would be more likely to seek a pitcher entering his prime, as Josh Beckett was when Boston acquired him for Hanley Ramirez in 2005. Both Hamels and Lee have no-trade clauses in their contracts that allow them to block deals to 20 teams. They appear too expensive for many of the teams chasing Lester and Price, which could make it easier for teams like the Dodgers or Yankees to add them. Depending on how much talent they are offered and how deeply they are committed to rebuilding manager Ryne Sandberg's roster, the Phillies could offer to pay significant portions of what is owed Hamels or Lee. It would be a real shock if they traded both, but left-handers rule this market and their position will be a lot better if the Rays turn down offers for Price.
