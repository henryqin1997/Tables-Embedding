    "textBeforeTable": "That makes him the highest scorer of all time away from his own turf. While his 23 tries in 32 matches on away grounds place him just behind David Campese's 24 in 39, when you add his seven in nine on neutral territory he overtakes Campo, with a total of 30 tries to the great Australian's 27. Next up on this list are Doug Howlett, an example of a player who was more prolific away, with 27 tries and Bryan Habana with 25. Shane's 60 international scores were, though, split exactly half and half - 30 at home for Wales, including two against Romania at Wrexham in 2003 - and 30 away or on neutral ground, 28 for Wales and the other two for the Lions against the Springboks in 2009. Such records inevitably favour players from the Six Nations, and in particular those from the British and Irish quartet, who play almost all of their home games on a single ground.

His 30 tries at home, 21 away and seven on neutral territory all lead his compatriots - Gareth Thomas with 17 home, 17 away and six neutral, tied with Ieuan Evans, stands second in each category. He is also Wales's highest World Cup scorer with 10 tries in 11 matches. Evans and Thomas, with seven each, again share second place. But his impact goes beyond his own national listings. Scotland have been playing international rugby for 141 years. In all of that time nobody has crossed their line more frequently than Shane, who scored against them nine times, taking the record previously held for most of a century by Willie Llewellyn with seven. He holds the corresponding marks for tries against Italy - also nine, one ahead of Dennis Hickie - and Japan, one up on Gareth Thomas. Some critics might put that trio together with comparatively moderate records against England (2 in 11 matches), Ireland (2 in 9), France (2 in 10) and New Zealand (1 in 7) and begin to make a case for him as something of a flat-track bully. That case, though, begins to evaporate when his record against the rest of the southern hemisphere is continued. The lists of leading scorers against",
