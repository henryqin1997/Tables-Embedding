Beyond that you will need to build a storage facility in which to store the resources you gather. A level 1 storage building can hold 2500 units of each resource. Upgrading these buildings will increase their capacity to 3500 units at level 2, and 4500 units when maxed out at level 3. More about upgrading later., 5560=Professor Milton Clodbottle has quite the interesting invention. Using his \"Habitariums,\" Neopians could, for several years, raise their own petpeptets (or P3s) and watch them work, grow, and even interact with their friends' Habitariums. Those that took care of them could create quite a money-making machine. Habitariums were discontinued in September 2014, when the Neopets servers moved., 66808=Following their purchase by JumpStart in early 2014, Neopets moved to new offices, and new servers. As a result of the move, the site had to be shut down for several days. During this period it was announced that Habitarium was no longer going to be featured on the site. As such, Habitarium officially closed on September 17, 2014.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Resources To buy things from the shop, you need resources. Handily enough, both Workers and Nesters can help you with that. To make your petpetpets gather a specific resource, place them near the resource tile that yields the resource you want. After a bit of scurrying around, your petpetpets will start to gather that resource. Not sure what resource yields what? Not to worry. Just check the table below to find out! (Keep in mind that of these six, wood, mud, and stone are the resources that you will need the most of.) Gathering Mama knows best! By placing a Nester petpetpet on a nest, that petpetpet will start to lay an egg. Once the egg is laid, it will need to be incubated for a short period of time. However, after the egg has been cared for properly, you can do a number of things with it. First, you can hatch the egg by clicking the center \"hatch\" button located at the bottom of the petpetpet viewer. This will hatch the egg and give you a new member for your Habitarium. However, you might not have enough room for another petpetpet. If this happens, you will be forced to harvest the egg by clicking the \"harvest\" button located at the bottom",
