I am working on a jewellery box in oak at the moment. The grain has some nice and interesting medullary rays showing which I would like to highlight when it comes to the finish. I had in mind a sort of arts & crafts medium oak colour. Can anyone advise on the best stain and approach to achieve something like this? I was thinking of applying a couple of coats of danish oil after the stain and then a final wax. Thanks in advance for opinions / help. Cheers, Tony",
