While testing, we found that the rangefinders struggled to detect objects past 5 meters. However, since our device is aimed for indoor use, 5 meters is more than enough range to detect nearby obstacles. We also found that the rangefinders could detect objects with about 1 inch resolution. This was especially applicable in our tactile sensor as it allowed the sensor to detect small changes in ranges, which in turn allowed it to detect small objects such as a door knob on a door., 20775=The microcontroller used for the ultrasonic wayfinder is the ATmega1284 mounted on a custom PCB. We initially went with the ATmega1284 as we expected to use Timer3 to accommodate the use of the pulse width output from the ultrasonic rangefinders. However, when we ultimately decided not to use the pulse width output, we already had most of the device built. With the given time time constraint of this project, we decided to use ATmega1284 to ensure a finished product., 48689=code available upon request trtSettings.h trtkernel_1284.c, 22884=Figure 4: Beam pattern of LV-MaxSonar-EZ0 Sonar Sensor (from the MB1000 datasheet), 23038=The ultrasonic rangefinders we used are the MaxBotix MB1000 sonar rangefinders. We used three of these rangefinders, with two mounted on the head-mounted navigation system and one used for the hand-mounted tactile sensor., 23950=The MB1000 sonar rangefinder supports three different outputs: 1) analog voltage with the voltage corresponding to the ranged distance, 2) pulse width output with the width corresponding to the ranged distance, and 3) ranged distance in RS-232 format., 40779=ATMega1284, 34547=IEEE safety standards for consumer products outline the need for a \"better user interface\" [ISO 9241-920:2009, \"Ergonomics of human-system interaction -- Part 920: Guidance on tactile and haptic interactions\"] To comply with these standards, we integrated several design features into our device. Our device is completely external and only interacts with the user via small vibrating motor discs. There can be up two motors buzzing at once, but they are isolated so only one motor per headpiece or handpiece system can buzz. This is to prevent the user from being confused by the navigation instructions. Additionally, to prevent discomfort from extended vibration in a fixed area, we pulse the motors with a duration inversely proportional to the distance away from an object instead of using a steady vibration. We also use a threshold of 2 meters to determine if an obstacle is in the user's immediate vicinity. The device overall is is hands-free which increases usability., 15512=The first term converts the ADC bit value proportionately from 0 to 255 (since the value is 8-bits) to 0 to 5V. The second term converts the voltage to distance in inches -- according to the MB1000 datasheet, the analog output from the sensor corresponds to (Vcc/512)V per inch. Finally, the third term converts the distance reading from inches to meters., 23284=Our two main criteria for choosing an ultrasonic sensor are to maximize range and beam width. As shown in the beam pattern diagram in Figure 4, the MB1000 sensor has a maximum operating range of 6.45m and a beam width that is wide enough such that two of such sensors placed next to each other would be able to cover as wide a field-of-view as possible.}",

However, as a disclaimer, users should be advised that our device is not foolproof. Just as with any visual aid, our device can sometimes miss a certain object if the user is walking too quickly. Users must use the same amount of caution while using our device as they would using a \"Hoover\" cane. Legal Considerations A comprehensive list of ethics that we followed while designing our device can be found on the IEEE website. We maintained a safe and controlled environment when testing our device on a variety of users. Individuals closed their eyes briefly and could open their eyes at all times. When testing, we constantly monitored users and gave a warning if they were dangerously close to an obstacle. Another aspect of ethics that we considered was the trust that the visually impaired would have in our device. By advertising our device as an aid for indoor obstacle detection and navigation, users would expect our device to perform its defined task reliably . We made our prototype as robust as possible, using a majority of our budget on quick and accurate rangefinders and coupling them with clear instructions from vibrating motors. We gave proper acknowledgement to our project inspiration and",
