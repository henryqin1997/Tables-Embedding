Feb, 23095=With the introduction of OS X 10.5 Apple had defined an gcc-extension for Objective-C which brings many interesting features to the language: garbage collection, properties, synchronization, fast enumerations, dot-notation for getters and setters, code blocks, etc. Although Apple provides their extensions back to gcc, integration is slow because it has to be tested against all other gcc features and also needs special considerations for different target architectures. So let's dicsuss another approach: write a preprocessor that maps the new Obj-C 2.0 features back to any existing Obj-C 1.0 compiler (plus some library calls if needed). This should allow to faster follow new developments of the language. The talk offers for discussion a flex/bison grammar for Obj-C 2.0 and some strategies for translating the new features., 28732=has internet access, will make breakfast room available for developers after 11:00 am.

We expect many lead developers and contributors to be present, so if you have never met them, you shouldn't miss this occasion!

Please send your proposals to GNUstep discussion list, the organizers mentioned above or - if you've got a wiki account - enter them right here. At first a title, a short summary, proposed duration and a preffered time slot would do, so we can start scheduling as soon as possible. deadline for filing is Sunday 2010-01-03, deadline for the papers is Sunday 2010-01-10 Note: The FOSDEM organizers strongly recommend a granularity of 15 minute blocks. So if a talk is just 15 (lightning talk), 30 or 45 minutes long - fine! But we should have 15 minutes breaks between the talks so that the visitors have enough time to find a seat and the presenters have enough time to get ready.
