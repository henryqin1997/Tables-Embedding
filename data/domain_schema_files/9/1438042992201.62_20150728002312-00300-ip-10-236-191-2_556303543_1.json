Update on Systems batch withdrawals from IRIS - Due to the increasing backlog of items in the queue, Systems will longer wait for RLIN to resume our batchloads and will resume processing withdrawals out of Unicorn either late this month or early November. Systems will create the necessary backup files should RLIN determine that any of the files already ftp'ed are corrupt., 6191=Items with no barcode and items with a barcode but no Unicorn record were pulled and stored in Ann's office. Ann asked how she should proceed with these. ISAWG responded that these items should be put back on the shelves but marked in some way so that they can be pulled and reviewed for appropriate action at a later date. Gracemary and Chris volunteered to visit Newark in early November to review the uncataloged material and begin to determine a course of action.}",
