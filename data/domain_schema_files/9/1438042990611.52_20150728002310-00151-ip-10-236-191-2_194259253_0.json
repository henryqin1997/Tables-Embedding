That suggests that the film may be naturally back-loaded going forward. Over the three-day frame, Vacation had an opening weekend to Friday ratio of 3.25 to 1 (the film took in $4.52 million on Friday, increased 28 percent on Saturday to gross $5.80 million and decreased 25 percent on Sunday to gross $4.36 million). Vacation may also be aided by the relative lack of new comedies arriving in the marketplace throughout the rest of August. On the other hand, the film's modest B rating on CinemaScore isn't the most encouraging early sign, though it does suggest that the film is going over better with moviegoers than it has with critics.}",
