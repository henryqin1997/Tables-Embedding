These included problems with USB 1.x peripherals that use split transactions, a fixed number of channels (causing problems with Kinect) and the way the ARM processor handles the SMSC95xx interrupts. [1] [2] A large number of fixes were included in the 2012-08-19-wheezy-raspbian Linux image., 53293=Here It is another option: http://www.dealextreme.com/p/hdmi-v1-4-male-to-vga-female-converter-adapter-cable-white-15cm-130458, is cheap (it's free shipping from china) and works perfectly, I tested it with an Acer VGA monitor (AL1511), without no change in my XBMC distribution. The config.txt for Raspbian (Flatron VGA monitor 1024 * 768): hdmi_drive=2 hdmi_group=2 hdmi_mode=16 hdmi_force_hotplug=1 disable_overscan=0, 103674=This adapter works, but (probably) requires a bit of work. The driver for the chipset (Asix AX88178) included with the Raspbian kernel (v 3.1.9+ Aug 7 2012) does not work. With that driver the device is detected, but it does not seem to be possible to actually put any traffic through it.\u00a0:-( In order to make it work you need to download the latest driver from the chipset manufacturer. The version I used was \"Linux kernel 3.x/2.6.x Driver\" v4.4.0, released 2012-05-18. Fortunately this is GNU GPLv2 -licenced source code and not a binary blob, so compiling it for the Raspberry Pi is perfectly doable. The hardest part was in fact getting the Linux source code required, because the repositores contained the source for the wrong kernel version. >:-( Fortunately there is a very useful guide for how to get the sources from github, and preparing that source so that you can compile modules. Unfortunately you will have to compile the kernel (even if you don't actually install it) - which will take the better part of the day on the Raspberry, but once that's done you can unpack the driver source and just run \"make && sudo make install\". Reboot and you should have a fully working ethernet adapter., 60293=The HDMI to DVI-D cable provided by Apple with the 2010 Mac Mini worked. It does not appear this adapter can be purchased separately., 58692=Sanoxy HDMI to VGA converter, $27 from Amazon, no changes required with official Raspbian Wheezy image (2012-Jul-15), note: had already disabled overscan previously, 47642=Note that manufacturers change their designs over time, even as the specs stay the same. (E.g. an ACME 8 GB class 4 card manufactured in 2011 might work, while one manufactured in 2012 might not.) For this reason, please specify product numbers in the lists below, when possible., 225605=Model B Hardware Revision 2.0 and Revision 1.0 with ECN0001 change This had the polyfuses removed, removing the 100mA current limitation for each USB port (but leaving the main fuse F3 intact). Users should still ensure their power supply can power the RPi and the USB peripherals. Revision 2.0 was released in August 2012., 52679=And another one: http://cgi.ebay.pl/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=251086464644. Very cheap but works perfectly. No config.txt changes was needed at all. I've booted Raspbian and OpenELEC. Monitor is detected correctly and the optimal resolution is set (Raspbian) or you can change the res in the menu (OpenELEC). The /opt/vc/bin/tvservice is able to read monitor edid data. I tested the adapter using NEC 72VM 15\" LCD. (1280x1024 60Hz, 1024x768 60Hz, 640x480 works) The adapter is based on Lontium LT8511A chip, but I was unable to get the spec for it. The D1 diode is getting very hot though. Most likely the adapter drives more than 200mA. The standard RS Components 1,2A usb power supply is able to provide enough power for the RPi and the adapter. I'll try to modify the adapter to connect external power to bypass D1.

    "textBeforeTable": "Working USB Hubs If you use a powered hub and PI PSU together consider powering them from the same power bar with switch, so you can turn them on simultaneously., especially if the HUB tries to feed the PI through their interconnect cable, due to the 100mA limiting fuse in the PI the PI will be partially powered which may cause problems (unwanted writes to the SD card). A number of low-cost powered USB hubs are known to have caused problems. Members of the Raspberry Pi forums have reported low power or no power at all in some cases. The following is a list of specific Powered USB Hubs which appear to be fault-free.

It is bus-powered hub, but very cheap and small and works after a small modding: on usb-hub board you have 4 holes: V, D+, D- and GND. Connect GND, D+ and D- to the RasPI, and additionally connect GND and +5v from power supply to the same holes on usb-hub GND and V. Now there is common contacts: GND, D+ and D- between RasPI and hub needed to work, and additional power for USB devices, connected to the hub. Tested on my RasPI.
