That was a surprise to me and a rumour I\u2019d not heard or read before., 223042=Of course I\u2019m joking Wath,but its partly true. When we put 5 past Chelski,the narks were out\u2026\u2026its papering over the cracks. We came from behind v the Dippers\u2026\u2026the narks screamed we were lucky,as we were totally outplayed. Sunderland\u2026.same thing,came from behind,played flat but got the result. Last week,we were in total control,yet we should\u2019ve buried them. These were actually games we won! I\u2019ve said it a hundred times,these were games we would have drawn at best,lost at worst,over the last few,seasons. I understand we all want the best for the club,but sometimes our support is strange,to say the least. I go back to one thing\u2026..in September,would we have taken a top 4 finish??? Bloody oath we would have,and we\u2019d have kissed Wengers arse at that time if it happened. We are there now,and I realise we can look back and think what if,but I don\u2019t see the point. Let\u2019s look forward\u2026..plenty of good stuff coming. 2-0,over Wigan\u2026..go you good things., 62275=http://www.thisisanfield.com/2012/04/are-liverpool-set-to-appoint-former-arsenal-chief-david-dein/}",
