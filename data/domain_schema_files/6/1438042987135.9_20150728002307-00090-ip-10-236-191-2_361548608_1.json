Literal question If a member of your family became infected with the AIDS virus, would you want it to remain a secret? Interviewer instructions The following four questions are meant to ascertain the respondent's personal opinion and attitude towards people with AIDS. We present a situation to the respondent, asking her to imagine a particular scenario. Then we ask her to tell us how she would react to the situation. Circle the code for the response given. Once again, do not prompt the respondent or indicate the 'correct' answer in any way. If a respondent says she doesn't know, is unsure, or that it depends, circle '8' for 'DK/not sure/depends'. --- Generated: MAR-03-2008 using the IHSN Microdata Management Toolkit",
