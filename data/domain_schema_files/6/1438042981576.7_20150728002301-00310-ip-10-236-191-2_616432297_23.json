Our review sample that featured eight GB of DDR3 RAM, a 500 GB SSD,\u00a0Core i7-4800MQ, and Windows 8.1 64-bit would currently add up to approximately 1600 Euros (~$2207)., 21182=A brightness of 308 cd/m\u00b2 is just as above average as a contrast of 936:1. The latter results from the decent black level. Although 0.35 cd/m\u00b2 will not excite photo enthusiasts, the black reproduction is good from the \"average\" gamers\u2019 point of view. A higher result would cause dark game and movie scenes to clearly drift into the gray range. This is supplemented by an\u00a0acceptable color space coverage. 84% of sRGB and 58% of AdobeRGB are not a matter of course in the laptop sector.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{37694=As can be seen in our graphic tests, the GeForce GTX 870M has earned its name. The Unigine Heaven 3.0 benchmark, among others, proves that Nvidia has made a big step forward. The K73-4N performed the test\u00a0with a velvety 65 fps\u00a0using 1920 x 1080 pixels and high tessellation. This frame rate places the DirectX 11 chip exactly between the GTX 770M (49.5 fps @ One K73-3N) or GTX 860M (49.5 fps @ Schenker XMG A504), and GTX 880M (81.2 fps @ Schenker XMG P704). AMD's main competitor, the Radeon R9 M290X, performs in the same regions (62.0 fps @ One K56-4N)., 36910=Nvidia uses the so-called GPU Boost as the counterpart to Intel's Turbo Boost. The GTX 870M's core is accelerated\u00a0up to 967 MHz\u00a0during load. The current GeForce GTX 880M top model (1536 CUDA cores, 8 GB of GDDR5 VRAM @256-bit) clocks with a maximum of 993 MHz. The Maxwell version of the GTX 860M even surpasses the magical 1 GHz limit. However, no matter whether Maxwell or Kepler: They are both build in the 28 nm process., 449529=$88.26 17.3\" LCD Screen For Clevo P170SM-A (One K73-4N) P177SM P704 EUROCOM X7 P375SM ( ONLY 1920x1080, NOT FOR 1600x900 ,NOT FOR 3D ), 35986=It is a bit better with the\u00a0GTX 870M. Compared with the\u00a0GTX 770M, not only does it have a higher clock (941/2500 vs. 811/2000 MHz), it also has a higher shader unit count. The GTX 870M offers\u00a01344 arithmetic units\u00a0rather than 960 CUDA cores, which corresponds to the level of the\u00a0GTX 680M. Other modifications are found in the memory. It is possible to argue about how much sense\u00a0six GB of GDDR5 RAM\u00a0makes. We believe three GB, like in the GTX 770M, would have easily sufficed, especially since the memory interface (192-bit) has not been increased.}",

Excluding extremely hardware-hungry games, such as\u00a0Crysis 3,\u00a0Far Cry 3, and\u00a0Hitman Absolution, the GeForce GTX 870M\u00a0even copes with very high details and multiple anti-aliasing without complaint. For example,\u00a0Battlefield 4\u00a0ran with just under 36 fps even in ultra presets (at least in our test sequence).

While AMD could score with a better price-performance ratio in the last generation (HD 8970M vs. GTX 770M), the \"red manufacturer\" does not have much to speak for it now. Although the GTX 870M is slightly more expensive than the Radeon R9 M290X, the customer gets an equal performance, a better developed driver, and a better designed graphics switching.
