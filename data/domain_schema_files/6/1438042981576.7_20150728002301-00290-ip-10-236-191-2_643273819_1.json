Wycombe Wanderers FC has agreed to host a Fans United Safe Standing Day at its home match on Sunday 9 September 2007 kick-off 1.30pm. This game is live on Sky. Long time campaigner and spokesperson for Stand Up Sit Down Amanda Matthews explained: 'As one of the few clubs left in the country with terraces, Wycombe Wanderers FC are firmly behind the safe standing campaigns run by SUSD and the Football Supporters Federation. They've agree to highlight our cause at their forthcoming match on 9th September by inviting fans from all clubs to come and show their support. The event is with the co-operation of Thames Valley Police and we appreciate their agreeing to it.' 'If we can just get one fan along from each club in England, wearing their own colours, we feel it would bring massive publicity to our cause and help persuade the Government that, at the least, an open and honest debate is needed on the subject, so important to many supporters, regardless of their club.' The campaigners say: WE NEED HUNDREDS OF FANS FROM OTHER CLUBS DESCENDING ON WYCOMBE THAT DAY DRESSED IN CLUB COLOURS! Importantly, subject to interest, the Football Supporters Federation will consider laying on free coaches. Anybody interested to email me at info@standupsitdown.co.uk as soon as possible. Let us know about your attendance and how many you'll be bringing. Let's turn Wycombe into a football United Nations for the day, make it a great day out for everybody. Both SUSD and the FSF are fully behind this. The club will be invited all the other 91 clubs and all the 145 MPs who have signed the pro safe-standing House of Commons Early Day Motion. Please give this event your support. For more details see the forum at www.standupsitdown.co.uk or email the SUSD team at info@standupsitdown.co.uk, 17936=Date:Tuesday August 28 2007, 9152=Posh Away Fans Decreased In 2014/15 (Monday July 20 2015), 10950=Posh Shaping Up Well Ahead Of League Campaign (Sunday July 26 2015), 10737=Stalemate Between Posh And Tractor Boys (Sunday July 26 2015)}",
