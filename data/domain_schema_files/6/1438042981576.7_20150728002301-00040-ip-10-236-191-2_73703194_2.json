G1K-4 cards manufactured prior to August 2003 do not support CWDM or DWDM GBICs., 45770=The E1000-2-G card also has one bicolor LED per port (Table 5-6). When the LINK LED is illuminated green, carrier is detected, meaning an active network cable is installed. When the LINK LED is not illuminated green, an active network cable is not plugged into the port, or the card is carrying unidirectional traffic. The port ACT LED flashes amber at a rate proportional to the level of traffic being received and transmitted over the port., 47221=The E1000-2-G is compatible with any traffic card slots (Slots 1 to 6 and 12 to 17) and with the XC-VXL-2.5G, XC-VXL-10G, and XC-VXC-10G cards., 104486=1310 nm multimode fiber, 99536=The ONS 15454 SDH Ethernet cards use industry standard small form-factor pluggable connectors (SFPs) and gigabit interface converter (GBIC) modular receptacles.

If the ACT LED is green it indicates that the E1000-2-G card is active and the software is operational., 104731=1310 nm single-mode fiber, 27119=The CE-MR-10 card provides ten IEEE-compliant, 10/100/1000-Mbps ports. The CE-MR-10 card can operate with the XC10G, XC-VXC-10G, XC-VXL-10G, or XC-VXL-2.5G cross-connect cards., 100300=For the E1000-2-G, G1K-4, ML1000-2, ML100X-8, CE-1000-4, or FC_MR-4 cards, use the SX, LX, ZX, or DWDM GBICs shown in Table 5-23., 116897=1558.98 nm, 115836=1535.04 nm, 116566=1550.92 nm, 83320=Note: For hardware specifications, see the CE-1000-4 Card Specifications., 43119=The E1000-2-G Gigabit Ethernet card provides high-throughput, low-latency packet switching of Ethernet traffic across a SDH network while providing a greater degree of reliability through SDH self-healing protection services.

The Ethernet ports support speeds of 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, or 1000 Mbps through pluggable SFPs. SFP modules are offered as separate orderable products for flexibility. For details, see the Ethernet Card GBICs and SFPs., 92334=The CE-MR-10 provides ten IEEE 802.3-compliant 10/100/1000-Mbps Gigabit Ethernet ports at the ingress. At the egress, the CE-MR-10 card provides an integrated Ethernet over SDH mapper with ten virtual ports to transfer Ethernet packets over a SDH network., 116243=1544.53 nm, 115760=1532.68 nm, 116490=1548.51 nm, 116015=1538.98 nm, 68172=The ML1000-2 card has two LEDs for each of the two Gigabit Ethernet ports. The port-level indicators are described in Table 5-14., 91729=The CE-1000-4 card can be installed in Slots 1 to 6 and 12 to 17 when used with the XC10G, XC-VXC-10G, and XC-VXL-10G cards. When the shelf uses the XCVT card, the CE-1000-4 card can only be installed in Slots 5, 6, 12, and 13., 116973=1560.61 nm, 42239=The E1000-2-G card uses GBIC modular receptacles for the optical interfaces. For details, see the Ethernet Card GBICs and SFPs., 72005=The ML-MR-10 card supports 1:1 protection at the port level. It also supports 1:1 card protection with redundant cards installed. For more information on ML-MR-10 protection, refer to the Cisco ONS 15454 and Cisco ONS 15454 SDH Ethernet Card Software Feature and Configuration Guide., 64719=The ML1000-2 card provides two ports of IEEE-compliant, 1000-Mbps interfaces. Each interface supports full-duplex operation for a maximum bandwidth of 2 Gbps per port and 4 Gbps per card. Each port autoconfigures for full duplex and IEEE 802.3x flow control., 29476=E1000-2, 67486=The red FAIL LED indicates that the card processor is not ready or that a catastrophic software failure occurred on the ML1000-2 card. As part of the boot sequence, the FAIL LED is turned on until the software deems the card operational., 101919=Single-mode fiber, 1310 nm, 84215=The Ethernet frames are encapsulated using the ITU-T generic framing procedure (GFP) (with or without CRC) or LEX, the point-to-point protocol (PPP) with high-level data link control (HDLC). The CE-1000-4 card can interoperate with G1000-4/G1K-4 cards (using LEX encapsulation), CE-100T-8 cards (using LEX or GFP-F), and ML-Series cards (using LEX or GFP-F)., 64447=Note: For specifications, see the ML1000-2 Card Specifications., 113993=1530 nm}",
