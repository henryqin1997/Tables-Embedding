    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{22609=The main event matches for the Elimination Chamber event consisted of two Elimination Chamber matches, with Raw's WWE Championship defended in one and SmackDown's World Heavyweight Championship defended in the other.[12] Qualifying matches were held on the February 1 episode of Raw to determine the five challengers who would face the WWE Champion Sheamus in Raw's Elimination Chamber match. In qualifiers, John Cena defeated Cody Rhodes, Triple H defeated Jack Swagger, Randy Orton defeated Shawn Michaels, Ted DiBiase defeated Mark Henry, and Kofi Kingston defeated The Big Show by disqualification.[18] In the weeks prior to Elimination Chamber the participants faced off in several matches, which included DiBiase vs. Cena ending in a no contest, Sheamus defeating Orton by disqualification, DiBiase defeating Kingston via pinfall, and Cena vs. Triple H ending in a no contest due to Sheamus interfering and attacking both participants.[19][20] The February 5 episode of SmackDown saw the five wrestlers qualify to challenge The Undertaker for the World Heavyweight Championship in a similar fashion. John Morrison defeated Drew McIntyre and Kane in a triple threat match. Throughout the rest of the episode, this was followed by R-Truth defeating Mike Knox, CM Punk defeating Batista via countout, Chris Jericho defeating Matt Hardy, and Rey Mysterio defeating Dolph Ziggler.[21] In the following weeks, the six wrestlers faced off in different combinations in singles matches that saw Mysterio pin Punk, Morrison vs. R-Truth end in a no contest due to Morrison suffering a storyline ankle injury, and Jericho defeating The Undertaker.[22] On the February 19 episode of SmackDown, Morrison and R-Truth teamed up to face CM Punk and his 'follower' Luke Gallows in a tag team match, which Morrison and R-Truth lost via referee stoppage.[23], 27615=In late December 2009, WWE Divas Champion Melina tore her anterior cruciate ligament, and was forced to vacate the championship.[24] As a result, it was announced in January 2010 that a single-elimination tournament would be held to determine a new champion.[24] The tournament began on the January 4 episode of Raw, when Maryse advanced to the semi-finals by defeating Brie Bella.[25] She was followed into the semi-finals by Gail Kim, Alicia Fox, and Eve, who defeated Jillian Hall, Kelly Kelly, and Katie Lea Burchill respectively.[26][27] In the semi-finals, Maryse defeated Eve and Kim defeated Fox.[28] It was then announced on the February 8 episode of Raw that Maryse and Kim would face one another in the final at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view., 40351=The next match was scheduled to be the final of a tournament to determine a new Divas Champion after the championship was vacated. Maryse and Gail Kim had entered the ring when official consultant to the SmackDown General Manager, Vickie Guerrero interrupted. Guerrero stated that a result of the Raw Divas making disparaging remarks about the SmackDown Divas, she was changing the match to an interbrand Divas tag team match, with Raw Divas Kim and Maryse facing LayCool (Michelle McCool and Layla) from SmackDown. The story of the match was that Maryse and Kim could not work together, and Maryse attacked Kim, allowing McCool to hit her finishing move for the victory. Following the match, Maryse performed her \"French Kiss DDT\" on Kim.[8][30] Following the match, The Miz was interviewed backstage by Josh Mathews about NXT, on which he was a mentor. He was interrupted by Montel Vontavious Porter, who informed The Miz that the two had a match next.[8][30] This was followed by William Regal cutting an in-ring promo about NXT. He was interrupted by the winner of the 2010 Royal Rumble match, Edge, who stated that he would be deciding which championship to challenge for at WrestleMania on the next episode of Raw. Edge then speared Regal.[8][30], 56019=After being eliminated from the Elimination Chamber match by Triple H, Sheamus attacked him on the March 1 episode of Raw in retaliation.[42] The following week, Sheamus challenged Triple H to a match at WrestleMania, which Triple H accepted.[40] On the final episode of Raw before WrestleMania, Sheamus teamed up with Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase to defeat Triple H and Randy Orton in a two-on-three handicap match.[43], 4508=Elimination Chamber (2010) (also known as No Way Out (2010) in Germany)[3][4] was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which took place on February 21, 2010 at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis, Missouri.[5][6] It was the first event in the Elimination Chamber series. Six matches were aired on the broadcast and one dark match occurred prior to the live broadcast., 14096=In late 2009, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) held a poll on their official website to allow fans to choose a name for their February pay-per-view. The choices included Elimination Chamber, Heavy Metal, Battle Chamber, Chamber of Conflict and No Way Out, which had been the name of the preceding Elimination Chamber-based event.[11] The name Elimination Chamber won, but the event was still promoted as No Way Out in Germany.[12][3][4], 50823=Edge returned from injury at the Royal Rumble as a surprise entrant in the Royal Rumble match, which he won, earning a guaranteed match for any WWE world championship.[36] Following Jericho's victory in the Elimination Chamber, in which he won the World Heavyweight Championship, Edge speared him the following night on Raw and announced that he had elected to face Jericho at WrestleMania.[34] Following this announcement, Edge began a campaign of surprise attacks on Jericho, spearing him on several occasions in an attempt to play mind games with Jericho.[37][38] On the March 12 episode of SmackDown, Jericho hosted a special edition of his talk show segment, The Highlight Reel, with Edge as the guest. Edge attempted to spear Jericho again, but Jericho was able to avoid it and hit Edge with the World Heavyweight Championship belt instead.[39], 62126=17,000 people attended Elimination Chamber at the Scottrade Center, drawing a gate of US$850,000.[2] The event received 285,000 buys on pay-per-view, an increase of 13,000 compared to No Way Out 2009's 272,000 buys.[7] The DVD of the event was released on March 23, 2010.[45], 9054=The event received 285,000 pay-per-view buys, an increase on the figure earned by the 2009 No Way Out pay-per-view.[7] Despite the increased number of buys, the event received mixed reviews, with reviewers criticising the undercard of the show as being \"weak\" and consisting of \"filler\" material.[8][9][10], 29798=On the February 12 episode of SmackDown, the WWE Intercontinental Champion Drew McIntyre faced Kane in a non-title match. After the match went to a double-countout, Kane chokeslammed McIntyre.[22] It was announced the following day on WWE's official website that Kane and McIntyre would meet at Elimination Chamber for the Intercontinental Championship. The following week, on the February 19 episode of SmackDown, Kane defeated Dolph Ziggler in a singles match. Following the match, he was attacked by McIntyre, but Kane was able to fight back and fend off the attack.[23]}",
