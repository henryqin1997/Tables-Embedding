    "textAfterTable": "Take note that the Xeon processor 5100 series (Woodcrest core) shown here greatly differs from the similarly numbered 5000 series (Dempsey core). Woodcrest is basically what Conroe is to the desktop segment but with SMP capability and a 1333MHz PSB, while Dempsey is similar to the Presler core (used in the Pentium D today) with SMP capability and a 1066MHz PSB. Given the massive comparisons we've shown you between the Core microarchitecture used in Core 2 processors versus the Netburst microarchitecture in the Pentium D processors, the difference between them is as clear as day and night. Thus you can see why the Xeon 5100 is a crucial pawn in Intel's lineup to move forward. From the Xeon processor 5100 series stack, you can see that there's a wide variety of processor configurations available to meet funding quota and/or performance needs. These processors are best designed to be used in dual processor (DP) platforms right from the start to give you give multi-threading support of two threads per socket or up to four when both processor sockets are populated on the DP platform. There's even one SKU that's ideal for high-density computing needs via the low voltage 40W TDP part. All have Virtualization Technology, true 64-bit processing, 64-bit memory addressing capability among other well-known features such as supporting Execute Disable Bit and more. Demand-Based Switching (DBS) however, isn't available on all processors. For those who aren't too familiar with this feature, it's based upon Intel's SpeedStep technology that stemmed",
