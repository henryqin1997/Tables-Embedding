This scheme is implemented in the State through 263 Government owned Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) having 1,04,473 sanctioned seats, 126 Grant-in-Aid Industrial Training Centers (ITCs) & 314 Self Financed ITCs. Director General of Employment & Training, Ministry of Labour, Government of India, under the aegis of National Council of Vocational Training (NCVT), lays down the guidelines for implementation of CTS. Under this scheme, the duration of various vocational trades training courses varies between 1 to 3 years. Every week, the trainee is expected to undergo 28 hours of practical training besides 10 hours of theoretical instruction ( 4 hours for trade theory + 2 hours for workshop calculation + 2 hours for engineering drawing + 2 hours for social studies ) and another 4 hours for extra curricular activities including library studies and physical training. At the end of the training 80 % attendance is must for appearing in the examination. Every year, in the months of July and February, the NCVT conducts All India Trade Test and successful trainees are awarded National Trade Certificates (NTCs).

Only 5% of the Indian labour force in the age group 20-24 has vocational skills as against 60-80% in the industrialized countries. Few important conclusions, which emerge from the World Employment Report 1998-99, are such as the limited demand for unskilled and less skilled labour, increase in demand for skilled labour on account of technological developments etc. Therefore, expansion of vocational training facilities in the emerging areas of employment has been recognized as an important strategy. Accordingly, DET has started 3-month duration computer related training programmes in several ITIs in the state (See Institute List). All registered jobseekers, if interested, are entitled to get admissions in such courses subject to the applicable admission terms and conditions., 19682=Under the proposed scheme 37 ITIs of Gujarat, are covered for upgradation as Centre of Excellence w.e.f.
