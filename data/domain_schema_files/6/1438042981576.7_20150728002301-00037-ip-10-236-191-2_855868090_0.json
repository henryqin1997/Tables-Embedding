My parents have a lake house at Lake Anna that Will and I go to often in the summer. Last summer, we went fishing with a guide who led us to catch 14 striped bass within four hours! It was the most chaotic, amazing fishing experience either of us have ever had. We also went fishing in the Bahamas last March. Will almost caught a shark (key word, almost). Nonetheless, it was unreal. I also love to go running. Last year my sister and I participated in the Army 10-miler and the Walt Disney World Half Marathon. Our next goal is to take on Disney's full marathon!}",
