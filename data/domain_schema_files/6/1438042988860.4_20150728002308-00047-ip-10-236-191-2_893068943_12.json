If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. This update resolves several newly discovered, privately reported and public vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in its own subsection in the Vulnerability Details section of this bulletin. Executive Summary: Executive Summary General Information The software in this list has been tested to determine whether the versions are affected.
