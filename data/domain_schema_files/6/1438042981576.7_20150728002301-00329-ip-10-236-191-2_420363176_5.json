This page displays the differences recorded in the full Gene Ontology OBO v1.2 file as audited by the UniProt-GOA database during its daily update cycle. Introduction The default number of records returned is 500, however you can increase or decrease this limit. In order to prevent possible browser problems, the maximum upper limit is 10,000. Limit You can enter a list of GO Terms in this field to limit the changes displayed. Please note that only changes made to directly listed terms will be displayed, not term descendants. Terms You can use this field to specify what types of term changes you are interested in seeing. Category If you do not enter a \"To\" date, then the period will be relative to the current date. If, however, you do specify a \"To\" value, then the \"Period\" value will display records in the timeframe up to and including that specified date.
