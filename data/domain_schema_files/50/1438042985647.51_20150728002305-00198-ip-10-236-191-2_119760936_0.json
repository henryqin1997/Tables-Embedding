When you research HVAC systems, be sure to talk to Mitsubishi Electric, the leader in INVERTER-driven split-ductless and ducted comfort systems and VRF zoning solutions in the United States. We will show you how our zoning solutions can save you money on a total-installed-costs basis. And when you consider the many other advantages of a Mitsubishi Electric system \u2014 precise comfort zoning, energy efficiency, scalability, simultaneous cooling and heating, low service requirements, and more \u2014 you soon will discover why we are the smart choice for just about any application. The Mitsubishi Electric Advantage Building uptime Less time spent renovating and installing means less disruption to building occupants. Financing Less time spent on projects means shorter borrowing periods and less interest paid. Mitsubishi Electric also can help with: Other Considerations Ceiling height With no ductwork needed, buildings can have finished ceilings, higher ceilings, more natural ambient light, and, potentially, more floors. System scaling Mitsubishi Electric units can be added easily and efficiently as building needs grow and change. Space Mitsubishi Electric's small refrigerant lines take up less space in mechanical chases and rooms, allowing chases to be made smaller. Unit placement Mitsubishi Electric's indoor and outdoor units are compact and quiet, providing greater flexibility in terms of placement.",
