He won his first Tour event and dominated the field at Pickwick Lake, winning by more than 5 pounds. Throughout the years, Rose has amassed a total of over $1.5 million in earnings and has finished in the top-10 over 30 times. 2010 and 2011 were banner years for Rose as he finished third in the Angler of the Year race consecutively. 2011 also marked a career-high third-place finish at the Forrest Wood Cup. Rose is known as structure fishing master and an electronics aficionado, harboring several large GPS and sonar units on the front deck of his boat. Rose is also known for his love of fishing crankbaits on the Tennessee and Mississippi River systems \u2013 thus prompting on-stage references to Rose being a \u201criver rat\u201d. He believes that his versatility as an angler is one of his greatest strengths. As a former centerfielder for the Arkansas State University baseball team, Rose loves watching baseball when he\u2019s not fishing. He also enjoys hunting and spending time with his daughters.}",
