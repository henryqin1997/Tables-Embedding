You tempted fate by drafting a guy we labeled as a bust at his draft position, and he rewarded you handsomely in Week 1. Don't give up on him already., 131776=The Bucs are going to get Martin rolling, particularly with Josh Freeman on notice. The Saints were the worst run defense in the NFL last season, and the Bucs certainly learned something from their 41-0 loss to the Saints in their previous meeting (Dec. 16). Martin had only nine rushing attempts.}",

We already outlined Wilson as a potential sit because of the matchup, but the health of the Falcons receivers has to have you questioning Matt Ryan as a full-go fantasy starter right now. Roddy White has a high-ankle sprain he says has him playing at less than 100 percent, and Julio Jones was limited in practice this week with a knee issue. Week 2 duds \u00a0 Josh Freeman +3 Philip Rivers +9 Eli Manning +3 Robert Griffin +4 Colin Kaepernick +2 Here are the quarterbacks in my rankings below I like more than other analysts: Philip Rivers threw for four touchdowns against a Texans defense that is much better than the Eagles'. The pace of this game should help him have a decent second half like Robert Griffin III did last Monday night. While Chip Kelly's offensive tempo seemingly does more for the running game, the production will get Vick more red-zone opportunities. He just needs to develop some trustworthy targets there. Brent Celek was one in Week 1. DeSean Jackson is more of",

Brown is now No. 35 in the rankings below. \u00a0 Outside of Adrian Peterson and LeSean McCoy, your elite running backs let you down in Week 1. Don't worry, they will pay you back. While he had a modest Thursday night performance against an underrated Jets run defense, Stevan Ridley gives us hope there is life after the doghouse. \u00a0 Week 2 star Remember how much the Jets run defense was picked on",
