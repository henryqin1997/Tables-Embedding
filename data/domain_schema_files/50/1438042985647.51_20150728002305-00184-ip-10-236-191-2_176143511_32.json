When set into a socketed item these gems can add powerful magic effects. Higher grades of gems have stronger effects. There are five grades of gems: chipped, flawed, standard, flawless, and perfect. Once inserted, gems cannot be removed from a socket. Touching a gem shrine either produces a gem or upgrades one gem (randomly chosen from your character's inventory) to the next higher grade. The skulls of some demonic creatures, inscribed with eldritch symbols, are said to work much like gems. Upgrading Gems You can upgrade gems by using a Gem Shrine or by using the Horadric Cube. You can use the Horadric Cube to convert gems into higher quality gems. Place 3 Gems of one type into the Horadric Cube and hit the Transmute button. Vendors do not normally sell Gems If another player in a multiplayer game sells a Gem to a Vendor you may be able to buy it. Vendors also will not typically pay you full price for socketed items. Gem effects Stackable If you place 3 Gems of the same type in",
