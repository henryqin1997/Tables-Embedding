The raw power figures are multiplied by the correction factor, giving us the ability to adequately compare engines tested in varied conditions of temperature, pressure, and humidity. Because engines make more power at oxygen-rich sea level locations than they do atop the Rocky Mountains, or in dry and cool climates as opposed to hot and humid ones, it's necessary to have a formula that takes into account these conditions to level the playing field between different dynos, or even different test days on the same dyno. The Society of Automotive Engineers developed several correction factors for dyno testing, and it's important that if you compare numbers from one dyno with the next that the factor be the same. Two of the dynos we tested used the SAE J1349 correction factor, which utilizes the following numbers for reference: 77 degrees Fahrenheit, 29.234 in-Hg barometric pressure, and zero percent humidity. The other three dynos used the SAE STD factor, which references 60 degrees Fahrenheit, 29.92 in-Hg, and zero percent humidity. Using the STD factor usually pushes the raw power numbers approximately 4 percent higher than the J1349. Keep in mind that weather correction factors do not change the rpm points at peak power., 38311=Dyno 2 Hours later, on Granatelli Motorsports' Mustang all-wheel-drive dyno in Oxnard, California, a location just a few hundred feet above sea level, the Super Snake put down 568 hp and 617 lb-ft of torque using the SAE J11349 correction factor. The first shop was located 790 feet above sea level, and this one was near the ocean. The dyno was using a 0.98 percent correction factor that actually reduced the raw numbers from 577.5 hp at 5,451 rpm and 626.9 lb-ft at 3,633 rpm. We were stumped as to why the Super Snake seemingly was down 87 hp (the equivalent of two air-cooled VW Beetle engines) and up 15 lb-ft of torque after travelling just 41.7 trouble-free miles from one shop to the next. More curious was that the Mustang dyno showed peak torque and horsepower occurring much earlier in the power curve than it had that same day at Muscle Motors.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Types of chassis dynos Dynos can be categorized as either inertia, hydraulic, or electric. An inertia dyno can only do full-throttle acceleration runs, but the best load-bearing hydraulic and electric dynos can do step tests, constant-speed pulls, and even part-throttle testing so that full road-load simulations can be conducted right on the dyno. 10/10 Westech Performance offered the only dyno built into the surface of its shop, a SuperFlow unit. Inertia Dyno: These extrapolate rear-wheel power output by analyzing the dyno drum's acceleration rate using a sophisticated accelerometer and computer software. A vehicle is placed on the dyno with its drive wheels sitting on heavy roller drums of known mass. The car is placed in gear and accelerated at wide-open throttle. It takes a certain amount of time and force for the tires to accelerate the rollers. The acceleration rate is directly proportional to how much power the tires place on the heavy roller to get it to rotate. Inertia dynos have the reputation for reading \"high.\" Generally, with mainstream vehicles in the 3,500-pound class, they'll yield consistent results with minimal setup time. They may have trouble obtaining accurate results with extremely heavy or light vehicles. Turbocharged engines won't build boost as they do in the real",
