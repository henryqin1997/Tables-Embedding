It's also expected that the Mexico City season-closer will be made a double points race so that Bourdais is not quite yet home and dry. Jimmy Vasser got his first podium of the year by finishing third in his hometown race, three seconds behind the Newman/Haas pair while Tracy's teammate Mario Dominguez won a fierce duel for fourth from Rodolfo Lavin, Bjorn Wirdheim and Alex Tagliani. Tracy said he did not believe Bourdais. \"They constantly monitor our radios,\" Tracy said. \"They knew what we were doing. It's frustrating. He didn't have the car to beat us tonight. He didn't have anything for us.\" \"He ran me up into the wall in turn two,\" Bourdais said. \"Then he ran me down to the white line on the backstraight and then he was jumping on the brakes. I was right on his gearbox and I was so surprised. I had no idea he was going to pit. We're very lucky because both of us could have ended up in the wall. I'm amazed we made it through because it could have been a big, big two-car wreck.\" Tracy emerged uninjured but his car was comprehensively destroyed and team owner Jerry Forsythe angrily confronted Carl Haas before going to complain",
