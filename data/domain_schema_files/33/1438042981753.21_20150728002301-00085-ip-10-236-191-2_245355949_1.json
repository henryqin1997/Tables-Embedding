We expect many lead developers and contributors to be present, so if you have never met them, you shouldn't miss this occasion! Who will attend FOSDEM t.b.d. Lars Sonchocky-Helldorf Organizers Note: this year we will have a joint devroom for GNUstep + Etoil\u00e9 + OpenGroupware.org but no stand/booth since running a stand consumes a lot of effort and there were complaints about the split up of folks between the devroom and the stand in the years before (and until now less people than in the years before have confirmed an attendance at FOSDEM this year) This page is for organizing GNUstep's participation in the event. This includes the organization of a developer meeting the Friday before FOSDEM. FOSDEM 2009 will take place at at the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, in Brussels on the 7/8. Feb 2009.
