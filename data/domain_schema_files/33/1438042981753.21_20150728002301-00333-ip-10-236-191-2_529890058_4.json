They are written in Hebrew, with a Yiddish spelling of names and street names. Dates are both the Hebrew date and the Polish one, written in Hebrew. In the notebooks is one consecutively numbered, chronological listing of primarily of births, licenses to marry and marriages, all together, from May 1927 until June 1935. (However, at entry #690, Rabbi Grushko went back and repeated numbers as if 690 were 670, and at 904 he jumped to 924.) The registry appears to be somewhat random, not a comprehensive list of all these events in Pinsk. According to Rita Margolin, formerly from the Pinsk archives, the addresses are mostly from one particular neighborhood. Apparently, this registry had an official meaning, because of the wording with regard to the licensing of marriages., 2679=In additional material, which was placed in the early notebook, is an advertisement in Yiddish for the Rabbi\u2019s services, which was probably distributed in mailboxes, in which he says he has lived in Pinsk since 1919, having moved there from Plotnitsa. At the time of the ad, his address was 47 Honcharska Street in Pinsk., 3011=Rabbi Grushko immigrated to Israel in 1935; there is evidence of this from the Pinsk Memorial Book [Volume I, part 2, Hebrew, page 257, table], in which it states that Rabbi Grushko was budgeted for the sum of 1500 zloty by the Jewish Community Council for immigration to Israel., 218038=\u00a9 2004 Belarus SIG}",

I also wish to thank the other volunteers who have helped translate these records: Shira Golandsky, Vera Novitskiy and Riki Shefi-Vered. The dates do not always match. I have never changed a date, so that the Gregorian date corresponds to the Hebrew one, or vice versa, because it is not for me to decide which is the correct date. In cases where only one date is used, that is the only date I have recorded. The amount of information in the entries is not always uniform. Some give addresses, others don't. Earlier registries tend more often to have addresses. Some are missing other data, such as the mother's name. This translation has listed every legible bit of information of importance for people searching for their families. There are some records of licenses to marry, for which there is no marriage entry. This does not mean that the marriage did not take place, but this is simply not confirmed in the notebooks. Where there is only the",
