            "Rarely does anyone put on the kind of old-fashioned butt-kicking that Johnson administered at Martinsville on Sunday. Then again, only two drivers in NASCAR history have more championships than Johnson. Team: Home | Stats | News | Gear",
            "After a brief stumble at the start of the season, Kahne has one victory and three top-four finishes in his last four races. With a fourth-place finish at Martinsville, he\u2019s red-hot right now. Team: Home | Stats | News | Gear",
            "Martinsville isn\u2019t one of Kyle Busch\u2019s better tracks, but he posted a fifth-place finish and led 56 laps. Busch is on track for a breakout season this year. Team: Home | Stats | News | Gear",
            "One of only two drivers with five top 10s in the first six races, the defending NASCAR Sprint Cup champion was seventh at Martinsville. Team: Home | Stats | News | Gear",
            "For the first time all year, Junior failed to finish in the top 10. Or the top 20, for that matter. That said, he\u2019s still off to a great start on the season. Team: Home | Stats | News | Gear",
            "A great rebound for Bowyer after losing an engine in California two weeks ago. Despite getting caught in a wreck, Bowyer recovered to finish second at Martinsville. Team: Home | Stats | News | Gear",
            "Martinsville is not a place where Biffle usually runs well, but he finished in the top 10 on Sunday. Team: Home | Stats | News | Gear",
            "Like his Roush Fenway Racing teammates, Edwards usually struggles at Martinsville. This week was no exception, as he finished 15th. Team: Home | Stats | News | Gear",
            "Although he led more laps than anyone not named Johnson, Kenseth had to settle for a 14th-place finish, not what he hoped for. Team: Home | Stats | News | Gear",
            "Certainly, Menard was looking for something better than a 19th-place finish, but he\u2019s still in the top 10 in points. Team: Home | Stats | News | Gear",
            "Third place was the best finish of the year so far for the four-time Sprint Cup champion. Team: Home | Stats | News | Gear",
            "A nice seventh-place result for McMurray, who is quietly moving up in the points. Team: Home | Stats | News | Gear",
            "No controversy for Logano this week, but no good finish, either, as he was 23rd. Team: Home | Stats | News | Gear",
            "Six races into his final season with Richard Childress Racing and Harvick has just one top 10 to his credit. Team: Home | Stats | News | Gear",
            "A horrible day for the elder Busch after his car went up in flames. Still, he\u2019s been strong this year. Team: Home | Stats | News | Gear",
            "For the second race in a row, Stenhouse failed to finish in the top 20. Team: Home | Stats | News | Gear",
            "The tough season for the three-time champ continued on Sunday, as Stewart finished 17th. Team: Home | Stats | News | Gear",
            "A 20th-place run wasn\u2019t too bad for Almirola and the No. 43 Richard Petty Motorsports Ford. Team: Home | Stats | News | Gear",
            "Obviously, Hamlin didn\u2019t race on Sunday. Lots of folks think he can still make the Chase for the Sprint Cup. Team: Home | Stats | News | Gear",
            "An impressive run for Patrick, who came from two laps down to finish 12th. Team: Home | Stats | News | Gear"
