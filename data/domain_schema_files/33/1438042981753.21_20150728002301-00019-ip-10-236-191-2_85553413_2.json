    "textBeforeTable": "The Fertrell Fruit Tree and Grape Recommendations Apply fertilizer around base of fruit trees in a circle equal to the length of the branches. This will cover the root system which, is equal to the expanse of the braches in size. All recommendations are in pounds per inch diameter of the base of the tree. A tree that measures four inches across the base and is recommended 2lbs per inch diameter should have 8 pounds of fertilizer spread on the ground covering out to the edge of the branch length. Soil Mineralizer and gypsum or Aragonite are added for mineralization and root growth in the fall. Super N and Foliar fertilizer are added in the spring for leaf, blossom, and fruit growth.
