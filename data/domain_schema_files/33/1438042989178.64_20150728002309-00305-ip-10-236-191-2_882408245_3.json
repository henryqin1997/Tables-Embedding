One project under construction in Marina Centre is the Marina Bay Financial Centre, which includes 3 office towers offering 3\u00a0million square feet (280,000\u00a0m2) of prime Grade A office space, 2 residential developments offering 649 luxurious apartments and a 176,000-square-foot (16,400\u00a0m2) retail mall, named Marina Bay Link Mall.[11] First phase of MBFC was completed in 2010. The second phase which includes MBFC Tower 3 will be ready by 1Q 2012. Marina Bay Suites which is part of Phase 2 will attain TOP in 2013. There are also several new developments in the city's shopping hub, Orchard Road. The Orchard Residences is an under construction 245\u00a0m (804\u00a0ft), 43-floor tower being built in conjunction with ION Orchard, a planned shopping mall.[12] In addition, the 218\u00a0m (715\u00a0ft) Ocean Financial Centre, a planned 43-floor skyscraper, has begun construction in Raffles Place.[13], 7733=Singapore's history of skyscrapers began with the 1939 completion of the 17-storey Cathay Building.[7] The 70-metre (230\u00a0ft) structure was, at the time of its completion, the tallest building in Southeast Asia; it was superseded by the 87-metre (285\u00a0ft) Asia Insurance Building in 1954, which remained the tallest in Singapore until the 100\u00a0m (328\u00a0ft) Shaw Centre was completed in 1958.[8][9] Singapore went through a major building boom in the 1970s and 1980s that resulted from the city's rapid industrialisation. During this time, the Overseas Union Bank Centre became the tallest building in the city-state; the 280\u00a0m (919\u00a0ft) structure was also the tallest building in the world outside of North America from its 1986 completion until 1989, when the Bank of China Tower in Hong Kong was completed.[3][10] The skyscraper-building boom continued during the 1990s and 2000s, with 30\u00a0skyscrapers at least 140\u00a0m (459\u00a0ft) tall, many of them residential towers, constructed from 1990 through 2008.}",
