England trounced Uruguay 43-5 to take second place behind Samoa in Pool C, Dan Norton scoring a hat-trick and David Williams a double in a seven-tries-to-one rout.

Fiji were left to rue their 22-21 loss to Australia and dropped to the Bowl. Australia began day two with a 26-7 victory against Scotland in Pool B. Cameron Clark scored two tries in a 16-point haul, while Allan Fa'alava'au and Tom Lucas also touched down.
