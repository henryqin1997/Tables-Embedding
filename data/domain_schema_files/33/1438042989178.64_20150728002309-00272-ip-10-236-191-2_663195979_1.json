    "textBeforeTable": "\u00a0 Results US only PhD/DBA only Assistant Professor: \u00a0 The correlation between salaries and teaching load has strengthened, as salaries in teaching institutions have declined moderately, at -.4182.\u00a0 The correlation between summer support and teaching load remains very strong, at -.6243. Teaching loads appear to have moved sharply upwards in both types of institutions, although 2005-2006 preliminary figures are extremely encouraging with a similar rebound to earlier times. \u00a0 We only have records covering 57 offers this year (down from 77 offers recorded last year and 90 the year before). I have not investigated whether this decrease was due to the availability of fewer jobs, fewer offers, or some technical problem.\u00a0 It is possible that more intrusive data might have continued to play a role too.\u00a0 The most important statistic in my informal analysis is that US PhD-only hires in research institutions still seems to be holding relatively steady at $98,286, down about 2 percent from last year's $100,448. In teaching institutions, offers declined 8.6%, moving the average to $79,316 from last year's $86,769.\u00a0 \u00a0 2004-2005 RESULTS: The final spreadsheet, in Excel Pivot Table form, is available by going to http://www.milletsoftware.com/Download/SalaryOffers.xls.
