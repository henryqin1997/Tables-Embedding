He was a star, and he won the 2006 American League MVP Award while playing for a series of very good Minnesota teams. In fact, Morneau won a Derby title while wearing a Twins uniform., 4651=The 2014 Gillette Home Run Derby would be a logical place to look. And, yes indeed, home runs could be found here. True, these are home runs hit against batting-practice pitching, but again, if you're way below your long-ball quota, this was the logical place to be., 4218=Monday night at Target Field, there were some impressive displays of power. But nobody was as impressive as Yoenis Cespedes of the Oakland Athletics. He won the Derby for the second year in a row. There has only been one other back-to-back Derby winner -- Ken Griffey Jr., in 1998-99.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "2014 Home Run Derby results The Derby remains one place where the homer is not an endangered species, but is instead, a way of life. As long as baseball can keep uncovering the occasional Yoenis Cespedes, the Derby will have a reason to live. The new Derby format, which was structured to have a player from each league meet in the finals, might have been potentially intriguing, but it was not completely equitable. The two players with the most home runs in the first three rounds were Bautista and Cespedes. But with this structure, they met in the semifinals rather than the finals. The Cespedes-Frazier final was anticlimactic. But anybody who wanted to be in the presence of power found Target Field the right place to be Monday night. Home runs were hit without any help from the Minnesota climate. An unusually cold day led into a rain delay for the Derby. This, in turn, was followed by temperatures in the 50s during the Derby. With conditions damp and, even for the upper Midwest, unseasonably cool temperatures, this was not ideal power-hitting weather. And Target Field is no hitter-friendly band box. More recently, Morneau's career was sidetracked by post-concussion syndrome. But he has come back in a big way with the Colorado Rockies this season. The Twins fans cheered Morneau repeatedly, and they cheered him as though he would always be, for them, that MVP-caliber player. It was touching. Morneau did not advance",
