At its first meeting, which was held in October 2005, the SMB confirmed that the highest priority for DFO Science is providing scientific support for ecosystem-based management. To provide this support, DFO Science needs a framework for realigning its focus to ensure the long-term stability of the monitoring and data management programs, and to maximize flexibility in the area of research and the provision of products, services, and, particularly, scientific advice to respond to changing needs.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{42567=Northumberland Strait, separating Prince Edward Island from New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, is 225 km long and ranges from 14 to 48 km wide. It features Canada's warmest ocean water temperatures. Surface water temperatures reach about 10\u00b0C by early June, and 20\u00b0C to 23\u00b0C by late July. Estuarine temperatures are higher and rise more rapidly in the spring. Shallow depth causes strong tidal currents, mixing of the water column from surface to bottom, turbulence, and a high concentration of suspended red silt and clay. Between December and April, sea ice generally covers the strait to thicknesses up to 120 cm, and water temperatures fall to about -1\u00b0C. The strait is less than 20 m deep over a large central area and about 70 m deep at its ends. About 140,000 inhabitants (2001 Census) in 55 communities reside along the strait., 48303=Since 2003, approximately 10,000 rainbow trout have been introduced every May and raised in the farm cage located in Lake 375. Changes in the size of cultured trout in relation to water temperature, nutrient retention by the farmed fish, and digestibility are carefully monitored to model waste production. Waste production and delivery to the sediments is also being determined directly, using a network of sediment traps located below the cage and throughout the lake. A mass balance model is being constructed to quantify the fate of phosphorus, carbon, and nitrogen added to the ecosystem by the fish farm., 37965=The strait is a major rearing area for juvenile Pacific salmon that traditionally contribute about 35 to 40 percent of the total Pacific salmon catch. Pacific herring in the strait are currently at historic high levels, amounting to 60 to 70 percent of the total annual B.C. herring catch over the past five years. There are major commercial fisheries for Dungeness crab, spot prawns, geoducks, and sea urchins, representing about 35 percent of the total billion-dollar B.C. shellfish industry in 2005., 47275=The study is quantifying the effects of aquaculture on water quality, primary production, sediments, and the composition and behaviour of native invertebrate and fish communities. A mass-balance approach along with measurement of stable sulphur, nitrogen, and carbon isotopes is being used to trace the movement of aquaculture-related waste materials through the ecosystem. The study lake, Lake 375, was studied for two years prior to the establishment of a small fish farm in 2003. DFO researchers are now following changes in key ecosystem variables in Lake 375 and a nearby reference lake, Lake 373, for which there is long-term reference data. In conjunction with these studies, a parallel set of observational data are being collected from active fish farms in Georgian Bay, Lake Huron, and in Lake Diefenbaker, Saskatchewan. These data will be used to develop models scaling the results from Lake 375 to larger systems currently used for aquaculture operations., 35913=More than two-thirds of the population of British Columbia is concentrated on the lower mainland and on southern Vancouver Island, on either side of the Strait of Georgia. In the next 20 years, this population of just over 2.7 million people (2001 Census) is forecast to grow 30 percent or more. Already a heavily used waterway, the Strait of Georgia is \u201cthe most at-risk natural environment in Canada,\u201d according to Parks Canada., 26226=The ecosystem approach to management is relatively new. It was pioneered in the Canada/U.S. International Great Lakes Water Quality Agreements (GLWQA) of the 1970s. Since 1989, Canada has spent nearly $300 million in federal resources on actions designed to restore and protect the Great Lakes. As a result, the lakes are cleaner and healthier today than they have been in the past 50 years.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Table 1 - Illustration of the common support each priority area of Ecosystem Science provides to the major clients of DFO Science. As illustrated in Table 1, these priority areas are common to the DFO program areas requiring science support (Fisheries, Aquaculture, Oceans, Habitat Management, and Species at Risk) and are important for the integrated management of human activities in aquatic ecosystems. Understanding climate variability and impacts on resources Understanding pathways of effects driving changes Considering impacts on aquatic biodiversity (Species at Risk Act and invasive species) Identifying habitats of special importance and sensitivity Generating integrated information for fisheries management Developing risk-based frameworks Developing ecosystem indicators and reporting systems Setting clear objectives for monitoring and protection The following eight priority areas, identified by the SMB under \u201cScience in Support of Ecosystem-based Management,\u201d provide a sound basis for the development of an ecosystem science framework. At the same time, improving the knowledge base for managing one activity will likely improve the information available to manage other activities in that ecosystem. Effective fisheries management, for example, requires much more knowledge about an aquatic ecosystem than simply the fish stock abundance and population dynamics. A good ecosystem science framework will benefit both activityspecific management and management of all activities considered together. DFO Science cannot continue to focus primarily on information collection and analyses",
    "textAfterTable": "(1 = direct and immediate supporting relationship; 2 = indirect but immediate benefits to clients from Science advances; 3 = indirect longer term benefits) An ecosystem approach is consistent with global trends, both in terms of other countries and research organizations. The European Commission is consulting on a comprehensive European Marine Strategy, which features an ecosystem approach to integrated management of human activities in the seas. The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) is reorganizing its expert groups to focus on integrated ecosystem assessments and its advisory committees to provide integrated advice to fisheries, environmental agencies, and commissions. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Ecosystem Review Team of the United States is recommending that NOAA marine science refocus on integrated regional assessments as the starting point for support and advice to all management clients (fisheries councils, sanctuary managers, and coastal zone planners). Benefits and challenges of moving to an ecosystem science approach Benefits An ecosystem science approach will enable DFO Science to identify, monitor, and interpret trends in the features that are most important to an ecosystem's sustainability, and integrate existing knowledge about the effects of fisheries, aquaculture, habitat, and oceans activities on these important ecosystem features. It will also help identify knowledge gaps and bring specialists together so that DFO Science can build its advice around increased understanding of these features (which vary naturally and in response to human activities) and provide",
