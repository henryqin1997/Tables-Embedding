For details, have a look here. This is very much unimplemented at the moment. Power management is of utmost concern to any mobile device. Battery power is quite limited, so we need to make sure we try our best to conserve it. (See also Power management requirements.) This page details the power management of the Phase 1 Neo1973. Much of it is inapplicable to earlier models. In progress: This article or section documents one or more features whose implementation are in progress.
