For example, the first MMTs did not have Short Mountain. Kerns Mountain was added even later. On the other hand, the early MMTs had the very tough Waterfall Mountain climb which has not been in later versions of the event. Also, the trail conditions have improved greatly over the years. The course in 2010 and after was significantly changed from prior years in that the start/finish was in a different location. Most of the trails were the same, however. Consequently, these are more properly Event Records not course records. True course records would be very complicated to maintain. We call these \"course records\" because that is the term commonly, though imprecisely used., 792=Updated through the 2015 Event}",
