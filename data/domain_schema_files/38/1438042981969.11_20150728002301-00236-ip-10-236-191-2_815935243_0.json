This stage has a pretty large part count.. It consists of four unitary gain op-amps, arranged in pairs, one per stereo line out signal into the board. The left channel's input resolves to two signals: 0\ufffd and 180\ufffd. The right channel's input resolves to two signals: 90\ufffd and 270\ufffd.

R21/22 form a voltage divider on the 5 volt rail and you should see one-half the 5 volt rail voltage WRT regular ground (about 2.5 Vdc).
