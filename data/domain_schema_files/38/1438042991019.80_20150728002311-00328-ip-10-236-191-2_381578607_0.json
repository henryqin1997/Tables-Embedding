Unfortunately, there's no back camera, a fact sure to disappoint those accustomed to dual-camera tablets. And by \"those,\" I mean pretty much everyone. The A200 sports what's probably the most adhesive back I've seen or rather felt on a tablet, doing an effective job of keeping the tablet firmly in my hands. The tablet is available in two different color schemes: a gray-backed version and one with a strawberry-red back. Dat grippy back! Tablets with corners that don't dig into your hands as you hold them always earn points on the comfort scale. The A200, with its smooth, rounded corners, is comfortable to hold over extended periods and likely won't give you blisters. For connections, the A200 has Micro-USB and full USB, and a microSD card slot (for cards of up to 32GB) is concealed behind a small door. It also has a headphone jack, a volume rocker, a rotation lock switch, a power/lock button, and a small pinhole-style AC adapter input hole. Unlike the A500, it doesn't have a Micro-HDMI port, unfortunately.",
