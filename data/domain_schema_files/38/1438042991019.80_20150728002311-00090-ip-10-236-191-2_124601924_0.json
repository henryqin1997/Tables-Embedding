It was a place where investors got research as well as access to deals for the dot-com boom. Tom also wrote the top-selling book, Investing in IPOs. In it, he covers all the aspects of analyzing an IPO, such as reading the prospectus, detecting the risk factors and understanding some of the arcane regulations. But don\u2019t worry \u2014 if that process is too intimidating for you, thankfully Tom will do the legwork for you right here in the IPO Playbook blog.}",
