The Wiltshire-based ref is in his first season in the top flight, officiating in three Premier League games so far. East was also the referee for Argyle's Devon Derby game against Torquay United in September and has been a regular in the Championship this season. East will be assisted at Home Park by Andrew Bennett and Brett Huxtable. The Southern Section Quarter-final on Tuesday 4th December will kick-off at 7pm. The tie will be settled on the night with no extra time. If the scores are level after 90 minutes the outcome will be decided by a penalty shoot-out. Each team must play at least six regular first-teamers, based on overall appearances or previous games. Argyle are ranked at 11/8 to win the game, Oxford placed at 9/5 to win and the draw has odds of 9/4 at 90 minutes.}",
