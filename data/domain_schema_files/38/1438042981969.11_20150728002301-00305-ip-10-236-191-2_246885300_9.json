            "Lots of changes from Romain Chossart, thanks for that! - The buffer is not displayed (actually, it is displayed then deleted quickly) when \"no Python doc found\". If the buffer was already displayed, it does a \"u\" to go back to the last pydoc. A message is displayed if no corresponding doc is found. I did that because otherwise, it forces the user to close (or to type \"u\") for \"uninteresting results\". (implementation is not very pretty, but it does the job). - The mappings are only set for \"python\" and \"man\" filetypes (the latter being useful for pydoc search inside pydoc) - Added two mappings : pk (for pydoc -k word) and pK (for pydoc -k WORD)",
            "The highlighting of the search-term is now optional and can be disabled. Set in this in your .vimrc to disable the highlighting: let g:pydoc_highlight=0",
            "This updates adds a simple highlighting to pydoc.vim. All occurrences of your search-term will be highlighted. It uses gui=reverse to be color-scheme independent.",
            "Version 1.0.5 contains some debug code (call to \"input\" twice), this versions removes it. Sorry for that.",
            "Changed the defaut mappings, because many other scripts are using the Function-keys. New mappings are pw for the current word and pW for the current Word.",

Just put a line like let g:pydoc_cmd = \"/usr/bin/pydoc\" into your .vimrc and the scritp will use the specified command.",

Life Changing Helpful Unfulfilling\u00a0 rate this script \u00a0 In order to install pydoc.vim download it from vim.org or clone the repository on githubi and put it in your .vim/ftplugin directory. pydoc.vim is also fully compatible with pathogen, so cloning the repository into your bundle directory is also a valid way to install it. (I do this myself. see https://github.com/fs111/dotvim). If the pydoc-command is not in your PATH, you can put a line like let g:pydoc_cmd = \"/usr/bin/pydoc\"\u00a0\u00a0in your .vimrc to get it working. The script will highlight the search-term by default. To disable this behaviour put \"let g:pydoc_highlight=0\" in your .vimrc. Note: You do not need a python enabled version of vim to use pydoc.vim, everything is done with plain vim scripting and should work on any version >6. install details \u00a0 This plugin integrates the Python documentation view and search tool pydoc into Vim. It allows you to view the documentation of a Python module or class by typing: :Pydoc foo.bar.baz (e.g. :Pydoc re.compile)",
