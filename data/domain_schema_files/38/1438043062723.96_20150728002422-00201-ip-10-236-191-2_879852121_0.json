In R/3 transactions such as ST04, on the other hand, times are generally specified in 1/1000 seconds. In more recent Oracle releases, more and more times are stated in 1/1,000,000 seconds (that is, microseconds)., 37241=Check whether there are tables that are greatly fragmented as described in Note 821687 (question 5). If over a period of time, the data quantity in a table is smaller than the allocated space, you should consider a reorganization., 44431=Some older Oracle patches still contain bugs that can cause performance problems. Therefore, check whether there is a newer version of the Oracle patch set than the one you are using (Note 362060 for 8.1.7, Note 539921 for 9.2)., 62476=12 Saturday Apr 2014, 24493=Note 521264 contains causes and analysis options in the event of Oracle hanging., 29319=If parallel query is activated, this can have a significant effect on cost calculation and database accesses. As described in Note 651060, check, therefore, whether there are segments where parallel processing was accidentally activated and deactivate it., 14940=See Note 842240., 40900=However, in certain circumstances, increased page-out on Windows may lead to problems (for example, due to the problems regarding Windows 2003 that are described in Note 1009297)., 48251=Make sure that the parameters rsdb/max_blocking_factor and rsdb/max_in_blocking_factor are set in accordance with the recommendations from Note 881083.

You can use Note 582427 to correct this problem. If objects are INVALID, validate them as described in Note 648203. In certain cases, serious performance problems may occur when the catalog information is obsolete., 76030=14 Wednesday May 2014, 8682=03 Monday Feb 2014, 27445=Check whether there are segments in dictionary managed tablespaces that include more than 1000 extents. If so, see Note 787533 and construct the segments with fewer extents when you have the opportunity., 79867=06 Friday Jun 2014, 46654=Ensure that you only maintain customer-specific entries that are actually still necessary in the statistical exceptions table DBSTATC. See also Note 122718, which contains the SAP standard exceptions. Avoid entries with OPTIO values with P<number> or R<number>, since this may cause the program to create statistics that are not sufficiently accurate. The DBSTATC entries suggested as standard by SAP can be taken from the dbstatc.sql script (for Oracle 9i or lower) or dbstatc10.sql (Oracle 10g or higher) , which is attached to Note 403704 and can be executed to initialize the exceptions table., 46957=Use Note 132861 to check whether statistical runs are scheduled on a regular basis and whether their parameters are set correctly., 25859=To optimize accesses to DBA views such as DBA_SEGMENTS, refer to Note 871455., 49443=Using Note 124361 (for Oracle 9i and lower), Note 830576 (for Oracle 10g) or Note 1431798 (for Oracle 11g) and the notes to which they refer, check whether the parameters correspond to the recommendations, and correct any that do not. For R/3 3.x, see also Note 160063. For I/O configuration, see Note 793113. The following parameters are particularly relevant to performance: DB_FILE_MULTIBLOCK_READ_COUNT, OPTIMIZER_MODE, OPTIMIZER_INDEX_COST_ADJ, OPTIMIZER_INDEX_CACHING, HASH_JOIN_ENABLED, STAR_TRANSFORMATION_ENABLED, DISK_ASYNCH_IO, EVENT, FILESYSTEMIO_OPTIONS, _FIX_CONTROL, and other underscore parameters.}",
