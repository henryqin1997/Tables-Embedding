And these speeds are provided by grearing. The Hydramatic use two fluid coupling and three planetary gearsets. The power flows through the gear assembly. Then by the fluid coupling, the power is trasnfferd. In each gear, the different gear ratio make a differences between the output and input torque.

Manual transmission is one and continuously variable transmission is another. The first advantage of manual transmission is a driver can pick any gear anytime during driving. This advantage brings more power at right time and better fuel efficiency. Downshifting makes high rpm and it will give extra power faster. Controlling rpm allows car keeps running with low rpm. Unlike manual transmission, automatic transmission is set shifting timing by computer, so if shifting timing is set 3500rpm, driver has to drive same gear until rpm reaches 3500; However, driving with manual shifting allows rpm controlling. Driving with lower rpm gives better fuel efficiency than driving with higher rpm. Second advantage is car with manual transmission is usually cheaper than car with automatic transmission. CVT, continuously variable transmission, has some advantages. CVT makes better use of a engine power. Even though manual transmission can control each gear level, there is a always better gear ratio between each gear level. Unlike conventional transmission, CTV has no gear level, so CVT allows driving with best gear ratio all the time. Because CTV has no gear level, there is no impact during shifting gear. Other advantage for CVT is CVT has simple structure and is lightweight. First disadvantage of manual transmission is driver has to use clutch when driver wants to shift gear, car starts to move, and stop. This inconvenience makes people choose automatic transmission. Another disadvantage is there are fewer people can drive manual transmission. Many people who don\u2019t have experience with clutch cannot drive car well with manual transmission. This fact affects car price too especially used car. People who only can drive buy automatic transmission car and people who can drive car with either automatic or manual transmission have option to choose either. Car with manual transmission only is chosen by people among people who can drive manual transmission car and want to buy one. Higher demand is higher price. CVT is kind of next generation for conventional transmissions, manual and automatic transmission, so CVT can cover many disadvantages of conventional transmissions. One disadvantage of CVT is according to Wikicars(2009), \u201cCVT torque handling capability is limited by the strength of their belt or chain, and by their ability to withstand friction wear between torque source and transmission medium for friction-driven CVTs. CVTs in production prior to 2005 are predominantly belt or chain driven and therefore typically limited to low powered cars and other light duty applications. More advanced IVT units using advanced lubricants, however, have been proven to support any amount of torque in production vehicles, including that used for buses, heavy trucks, and earth moving equipment.\u201d These alternatives can be compared first by gear level. Automatic transmission and alternative for automatic transmission, manual transmission, has gear levels but another alternative for automatic transmission, CVT, doesn\u2019t have gear level. Second is method of shifting gear. Automatic transmission is computer shifts each gear level automatically at certain rpm but manual transmission is driver need to shift manually when driver think it\u2019s right time. Price of each type Our project turbo hydra-matic, automatic transmission is from very old car, so for fair comparison, price will be compared modern automatic transmission with modern CVT and manual transmission., 33279=Start dissecting: Oct. 8th Meeting date in the Lab: every Wed. 7pm~9pm, 87433=Gear Ratio 1st 2.315:1 2nd 1.568:1 3rd 1.195:1 4th 1.000:1 5th 0.915:1}",

We will work on stage 1 for 2 weeks. Further stages will take 1 week for each since further stages required few new information and improving previous stage. Reversing engineer our product is another task that will take us a lot of time. We need to take the engine apart. Taking out the pump is going to be the first step. Then you put the transmission on its pan to remove the tail shaft housing, governer assembly, and speedometer gear. The right tools are going to be a necessity for the successful outcome of this project. Some tools that will be required to take apart our project will include screwdrivers, both standard and Phillips head; socket wrenches, either English or metric; and pliers to remove the small parts.
