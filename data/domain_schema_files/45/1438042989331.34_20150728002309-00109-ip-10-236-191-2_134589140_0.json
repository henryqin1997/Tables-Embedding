If you would like to help out with the Cubs, either as a uniformed leader or on a more irregular basis, please ask any one of the leaders. It is both rewarding and enjoyable and a role we would recommend to anyone. Parent Helpers Term fees are due on the first week back. These are \u00a320 for existing Cubs and \u00a325 for new Cubs, to cover investiture. These can be paid either using the online system or in cash or by cheque, if you prefer. Be aware that the payment system may send out emails even if you have paid manually. In that case, you can ignore the request for payment. Term Fees As you may be aware, Kirkhill Church has a new minister, Dr Jonathan Humphrey. We would like to extend a warm Scouting welcome to Dr Humphrey and his family. It is hoped that he will be coming to visit us some time this term to see what the Cubs get up to.
