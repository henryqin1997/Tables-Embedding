The reform significantly impacted the methods used for depreciation of assets in Japan and provided new guidelines on the calculation and treatment of depreciation of assets. The purpose of the new deprecation rules laid down in the FY2007 Tax Reforms is to increase the Depreciation expenses by abolishing salvage value and increasing the depreciation limit on assets so that the companies can reduce National and Local taxes. Additionally, new depreciation methods were introduced and extended depreciation feature made available for assets acquired before April 1, 2007. In order to address the Japanese depreciation requirements, the following Japan specific depreciation methods have been created and seeded within Oracle Assets., 334005=The Dual Rate Evaluation depreciable basis rule is part of the predefined rules. This depreciable basis rule determines the basis for the calculation of depreciation.

That is, if the asset is retired one year later on 04-JAN-1999, no depreciation is taken during the depreciation period January 1999. If the asset is retired in the second half of the last depreciation period of the asset's life, half a month of depreciation is taken. For instance, if the asset is retired on 18-JAN-1998, depreciation is taken for the prorate period 01-JAN-1998 through 15-JAN-1998, but not for the prorate period 16-JAN-1998 through 31-JAN-1998., 158501=Note: To meet the requirements for the Japan Tax Reforms, the Cost and NBV at Beginning of Year parameters were added to the Test Formula tabbed region. The system displays these parameters only when the FA: Japan 2007 Tax Reforms Features profile option is set to Yes. For more information, see Japan Tax Reforms features., 340053=The reform provided an extended depreciation benefit to assets acquired before April 1, 2007 which have already reached the earlier depreciation limit of 95%. Under this benefit, these assets could now be depreciated further to 1 Yen using the Straight Line method over a 60 month period. Through the Find Eligible Assets window, you can search for the eligible assets and then use the Set Extended Depreciation window to record the decision whether or not a particular asset should be avail for extended depreciation. Once the decision is recorded on the asset and then you click on the Submit button of Set Extended Depreciation window, a concurrent process is launched to update the depreciation method to JP-STL-EXTND and depreciation limit is set to 1 Yen., 329544=As a result of the reform, new Straight Line depreciation rates were published for assets acquired on or after April 1, 2007. The Straight Line depreciation rate calculation for assets acquired prior to April 1, 2007 used rates rounded downward rather than upward as required by the new reform. As a result, the existing seeded JP-STL XXYR depreciation methods were modified. For depreciation terms where the rate calculation required by the reform impacted the rate, an additional rate line was added to the depreciation method. For depreciation methods where there was not an impact, the method continues to contain a single rate line. For example, in the JP-STL depreciation methods for assets with a life of four or five years the change in the rounding did not impact the rate, therefore, only one rate line is defined. Whereas in JP-STL deprecation methods for asset with lives of three to six, there was an impact on the rate, so an additional rate line was added. The method contains one rate that can be used for assets with a DPIS of prior to April 1, 2007 with another for assets with a DPIS on or after April 1, 2007., 365105=Fiscal Year: April \u2013 March, 186258=FY 2018 = 6.667% * (1 - 50%) = 3.3335%, 397049=On April 1, 2000, an asset was recorded into Oracle Assets with the following details:, 344723=The system adds the Extended Depreciation menu option to the Depreciation menu if the FA: Japan 2007 Tax Reforms Features profile option is set to Yes.
