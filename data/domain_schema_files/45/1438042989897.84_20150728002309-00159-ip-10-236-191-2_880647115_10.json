MBSA 1.2.1 will determine whether this update is required for Exchange 5.0, Exchange 5.5 Server and Exchange 2000 Server. For more information about MBSA, visit the MBSA Web site. MBSA 1.2.1 for Microsoft Office will determine and support local scans for Office 2000, Office XP, Office 2003, Office XP Multilingual User Interface Packs, and Office 2003 Multilingual User Interface Packs. MBSA uses an integrated version of the Office Detection Tool (ODT) which does not support remote scans of this issue. For more information about MBSA, visit the MBSA Web site. For more information about MBSA support, visit the following Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer 1.2 Q&A Web site. Note Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) 1.2.1 will not determine whether this update is required for Microsoft Office 2003 Language Interface Packs., 29050=For more information about Exchange 2000 Server Post-Service Pack 3 Update Rollup see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 870540., 22009=I am still using Microsoft Exchange 5.0 Server or Microsoft Exchange 5.5 Server. Originally, extended security update support ended on December 31, 2005. This bulletin has a security update for Microsoft Exchange 5.0 Server or Microsoft Exchange 5.5 Server. Why is that? Microsoft Exchange 5.0 Server or Microsoft Exchange 5.5 Server had reached the end of their life cycles on December 31, 2005. However, in order to create greater consistency and predictability for customers, Microsoft is matching the date that the product support lifecycle ends, with the regular monthly security update release cycle. Exchange 5.0 Server or Exchange 5.5 Server extended security support ends on January 10, 2006. For more information about the Windows Service Pack Product Life Cycle, visit the Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site. For more information about the Windows Product Life Cycle, visit the Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site., 2379=For additional information about how to determine the version of Office 2000 that is installed on your computer, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 255275., 31085=Microsoft Office 2003 Software:, 3231=Windows Installer 2.0 for Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0, 25135=What are Office 2000 MultiLanguage Packs (MUI)?

It includes the Microsoft Office Proofing Tools, which provide spelling checkers, grammar checkers, and other tools for editing in a variety of languages., 19622=Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) 2.0 to determine whether this update is required? Yes. MBSA 2.0 will determine whether this update is required for Office XP, Office 2003, Office XP Multilingual User Interface Packs, Office 2003 Multilingual User Interface Packs and Exchange 2000 Server. MBSA 2.0 can detect security updates for products that Microsoft Update supports. For more information about MBSA, visit the MBSA Web site. MBSA 2.0 does not support the detection of Exchange 5.0 Server, Office 2000, Office 2000 MultiLanguage Packs or Office 2003 Language Interface Packs. You should use MBSA 1.2.1 to determine if this update is required. MBSA 2.0 can detect security updates for products that Microsoft Update supports. For more information about the programs that Microsoft Update and MBSA 2.0 currently do not detect, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 895660. Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required? Yes. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update. However, SMS uses MBSA for detection; therefore, SMS has the same limitation listed earlier in this bulletin related to programs that MBSA does not detect. SMS can also use the Microsoft Office Inventory Tool to detect required updates for Microsoft Office applications, 23034=I do not have Outlook installed, but I have Office 2000 MultiLanguage Packs (MUI), Office 2003 Multilingual User Interface Packs(MUI), Office XP Multilingual User Interface Packs (MUI) or Office 2003 Language Interface Packs (LIP) installed.

    "textBeforeTable": "Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers: We recommend that customers apply the update immediately. On vulnerable versions of Exchange, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. This vulnerability could be exploited automatically without user interaction. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. On vulnerable versions of Outlook, Office Language Interface Packs, Office MultiLanguage Packs or Office Multilingual User Interface Packs, if a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the client workstation. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. This update resolves a newly-discovered, privately-reported vulnerability that could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code on the system. The vulnerability is documented in the \u201cVulnerability Details\u201d section of this bulletin.
