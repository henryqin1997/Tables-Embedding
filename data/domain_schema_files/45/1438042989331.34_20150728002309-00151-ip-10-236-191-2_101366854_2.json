Web. 07 Dec. 2012. <http://www.familyhandyman.com/DIY-Projects/Saving-Money/Buying-Tools/how-to-use-an-angle-grinder/View-All>, 7331=Our group plans to perform the disassembly October 10 and 12 in the lab. Given the relatively small size of our product, we do not expect the dissection process to take longer than these two three hour sessions. During the disassembly process we will have one member take pictures of the product after each step of the dissection and one member record a written description of each step. This will facilitate the eventual reassembly of the part. Once the product has been fully disassembled and analyzed, we will reassemble the product by putting the parts back together in the same order we took them apart. The same tools used for disassembly should suffice for this part. Our preliminary dates for completing the reassembly are November 19 and in the lab. The remaining jobs such as part analysis and written submissions will as a rule be completed two days before each gate is due.

    "textBeforeTable": "In this section our group provides a brief summary of each group member's skills and flaws relevant to the project. The primary traits we were concerned with were general experience with machines, experience with angle grinders, computer and solid modeling skills, people skills, and availability. We decided that these factors would provide an adequate idea of which parts of the project each group member would be best for, as well as helping us figure out which skills we would have to develop over the course of the project. This self-evaluation is provided in Table 1 below. Analysis of Group Members Figure 1: Proposed Timeline of Events for Project Needle Nose Pliers T-15-T-25 Torx wrenches In addition, these are the tools our group may or may not need, depending on the nature of the internal components: 4 mm-6 mm Crescent Wrenches or Sockets w/ Socket Driver 5/32\u201d-1/4\u201d Crescent Wrenches or Sockets w/ Socket Driver 1/16\u201d-1/8\u201d Phillips Head and Flathead Screwdrivers Based on an initial assessment of the product's exterior and the fasteners in place, these are the tools we expect to need for reassembly and disassembly: Our group plans to perform the disassembly October 10 and 12",
