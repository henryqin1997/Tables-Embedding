Either way, I\u2019ve started to sour a bit on the Lions recently, and it largely has to do with them having greater success than my favorite team in the Vikings. Now, I DO foresee a crash back to earth this season where they play some middling ball largely because they didn\u2019t upgrade their defense this offseason, and also partially because they\u2019ve turned into a team with a bunch of criminals (says the guy who writes a blog about the Vikings, I get it). The Detroit Lions sure are cute. I\u2019ve raved about their awesome wide receiver Calvin Johnson, the boner-inducing defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, and have been jealous of their metal music listening head coach in Jim Schwartz.
