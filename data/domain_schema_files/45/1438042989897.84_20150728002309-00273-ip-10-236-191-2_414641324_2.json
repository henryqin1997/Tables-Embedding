As the name suggests, this laptop has a wonderfully responsive touchscreen, making it easy for the kids to use Windows 8 and its apps. Some corners have had to be cut and the AMD A4 processor is a little slow. It will cope with day-to-day apps and the Internet, but editing photos and videos could be a bit slow. Likewise, the integrated graphics will struggle with modern 3D games, although they will cope with older titles. With decent battery life and a 500GB hard disk, this HP is a good choice if portability is more important than power.

    "textAfterTable": "Size and weight For most families, a laptop with a 15.6in screen will do the job nicely. This gives you a nice trade-off between a comfortable screen size, weight and overall portability. Get the lightest laptop you can afford, but you'll be looking at a model that most likely weighs between 1.8kg and 2.3kg at this size. If you want something a bit more portable that you can take everywhere with you, a model with an 11.6in or 13.3in screen will do the job. These will weigh somewhere between 1.4kg and 1.8kg. The trade off here is that you'll have to make-do with a slower processor in order to keep the price down. \u00a0 Battery life As you'll mostly be using your laptop around the home, battery life isn't such an important consideration, but it's still good to get one that can be used away from the mains socket for a decent amount of time. That will give you more flexibility to use it around the house, and perhaps out in the garden. Judging the longevity of a laptop\u2019s battery is always difficult, as it depends on the applications you use. Relatively undemanding programs such as web browsers, email clients and word processors use far less battery power, for example, than games and video playback.",
