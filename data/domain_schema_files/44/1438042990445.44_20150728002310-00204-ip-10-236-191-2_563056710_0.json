The \"HVR\" stands for Hybrid Video Recorder. WinTV-NEXUS Hauppauge used the WinTV-NEXUS moniker for digital TV PCI cards that included an onboard MPEG-2 decoder; these were rebranded Technotrend SkyStar 1.x full-featured cards to which a second PCI card could be interconnected to provide hardware support for Common Interface subscription-TV modules. WinTV-NOVA Hauppauge uses the WinTV-NOVA moniker for their digital TV PCI cards that lack an onboard MPEG-2 decoder (i.e. the designation is used for their so-called \"budget\" or software decoding cards). The -C, -S or -T suffices respectively signify whether the device is intended for DVB-C, DVB-S or DVB-T reception. Many of Hauppauge's early DVB-S and DVB-T products were actually rebranded TechnoTrend devices. This, however, is no longer the case today.
