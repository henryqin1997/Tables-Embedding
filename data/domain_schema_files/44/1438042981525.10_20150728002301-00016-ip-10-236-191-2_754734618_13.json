Thursday Night Update: Devin Hester has been held out of practices because of his calf and now he runs a big risk of not playing on Sunday. I am removing him from the projections now though he has not been ruled out. He has a bad matchup anyway and now is not healthy. This rematch has the 8-4 Packers playing for a wildcard berth and on a four game winning streak. The Bears are 5-7 and not likely to contend but they are 4-2 at home this year and the Packers are 3-2 on the road. The Packers opened the season with a 21-15 home win over the Bears. *updated *NYJ @ TB *MIA @ JAC *DET @ BAL ARI @ SF SD @ DAL *CAR @",

The lone remaining home game against the Seahawks should be easy enough but the Packers end with three road trips to Chicago, Pittsburgh and Arizona. This week is a must win because the Steelers and Cardinals will be trouble. Quarterback: Aaron Rodgers remains one of the elite quarterbacks in the league with a score in every game and 25 passing touchdowns on the year. He has only thrown seven interceptions and eight games have no turnovers. He's a lock",
