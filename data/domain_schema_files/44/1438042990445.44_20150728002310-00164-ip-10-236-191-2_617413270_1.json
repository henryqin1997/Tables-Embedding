This leads to quicker acceleration and an expanded wind range. Following the extremely successful WARP F2012 the compact shape got taken over, but with a slightly longer CROSS.BATTEN. This results in greater comfort and control during acceleration and in overpowered conditions, because the longer CROSS.BATTEN flexes more. These and many other details secure that the S_TYPE combines planing with impressive performance and incredible speed. Better than any other sail - without any disadvantages in control or handling! The medium wide luff sleeve supports this, CONICAL.AERO.SLEEVE.DESIGN that offers the best combination of optimum propulsion and great for water starting., 7954=With the new S_TYPE the incredible story of our most successful sail continues! International magazines have repeatedly declared the predecessors as test winner, which made the S_TYPE the benchmark in its class. To maintain this, for 2013 Kai Hopf developed new features and an optimized profile which increase the outstanding performance yet again.}",

Simply ingenious: All S_TYPE sizes work with one mast length! Another reason for the huge range of use is the medium-size CONICAL.AERO.SLEEVE. DESIGN mast pocket. This represents the ideal compromise between optimum propulsion and comfortable waterstart behaviour. Regardless whether at high speed or simply cruising and jibing, the S_TYPE has many faces - the perfect universal performer.
