It was 1.20 for CHD and the paper noted a factor of 1.22 to be applied for all-cause mortality (calculated from a slightly different eight studies). Overall inactivity (table 1) was noted as 42.9%. Multiply inactivity (42.9%) by what has been assumed to be the risk factor for inactivity (0.22) and this gives 9%. Then declare that 9% of the 57 million deaths worldwide, which occurred for reasons from war to famine to infectious disease to non communicable disease, could have been avoided if only people did a magic number of 150 minutes of activity each week, as recorded in eight studies back as far as 1978., 30003=\u201cFor all-cause mortality, the overall median PAF was 9%. Applying this figure to the 57 million deaths worldwide in 2008, we estimated that more than 5\u00b73 million deaths (ranging from 525\u00a0000 in the eastern Mediterranean to 1\u00b75 million in the western Pacific region) could be averted every year if all inactive people become active.\u201d, 18187=\u2013 Taking the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study as an example, baseline activity levels as far back as 1978 are assumed by this study to determine, working through the steps, global deaths in 2008., 12215=1993-2011, 3986=\u201cWorldwide, we estimate that physical inactivity causes 6% (ranging from 3\u00b72% in southeast Asia to 7\u00b78% in the eastern Mediterranean region) of the burden of disease from coronary heart disease, 7% (3\u00b79\u20149\u00b76) of type 2 diabetes, 10% (5\u00b76\u201414\u00b71) of breast cancer, and 10% (5\u00b77\u201413\u00b78) of colon cancer. Inactivity causes 9% (range 5\u00b71\u201412\u00b75) of premature mortality, or more than 5\u00b73 million of the 57 million deaths that occurred worldwide in 2008. If inactivity were not eliminated, but decreased instead by 10% or 25%, more than 533\u00a0000 and more than 1\u00b73 million deaths, respectively, could be averted every year. We estimated that elimination of physical inactivity would increase the life expectancy of the world\u2019s population by 0\u00b768 (range 0\u00b741\u20140\u00b795) years.\u201d, 22346=I could present the data from the Whitehall study table above as 20% more active people developed CHD than inactive people [(54.6-45.4)/45.4], 13461=1997-2004, 6030=The reference cited for the recommendation of 150 minutes a week is the US Department of Health Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Report, 2008., 12621=1987-2009, 14281=1985-2004, 29572=The study applies the PAF percentages for each region and concludes that \u201c15,000 deaths from coronary heart disease in Africa could have been averted in 2008 by removal of physical inactivity. 60\u00a0000 could have been avoided in the Americas, 44\u00a0000 in the eastern Mediterranean region, 121\u00a0000 in Europe, 59\u00a0000 in southeast Asia, and 100\u00a0000 in the western Pacific region.\u201c, 3060=We woke up on July 18th 2012 to the news \u201cInactivity \u2018killing as many as smoking\u2018\u201d.

Please note here that this stage of the process is therefore recording incidence and deaths from CHD, not just deaths. The conclusions of the overall study, which rely fundamentally on this stage, are all about deaths. The team found 10 epidemiological studies (studies of a particular population) where data had been collected over a period of time for activity and incidence of coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, colon cancer and breast cancer \u2013 the factors being considered by this study. We need to spend a bit of time on Step 1 because it is the crux of the study. This step is not even in the body of the article \u2013 it is the appendix \u2013 the 22 pages of tables with next to no explanations, as mentioned in the introduction to this post. Step 1 The study also relies on self reported activity, which is notoriously unreliable. Japan recorded one of the highest levels of INactivity, which surprised me. Did the Japanese people not think of their walk or cycle to work as activity? Given that the study is global \u2013 all countries from Ethiopia to America, Malta to Australia and Argentina to Iran, the lifestyles that are naturally active (the \u2018third world\u2019 farming communities) could hardly be more different to the 4am gym generation of New York.

I found this part of the process incredible \u2013 the straight average of all the studies was taken \u2013 not a weighted average. Three of the studies were American, three British, one from Finland and one of Shanghai women. These eight were averaged to apply a global factor to then be applied to every country in the study. The study took inactivity overall in each study and inactivity in \u201cpersons eventually developing or dying from CHD.\u201d This was used to derive an \u201cadjustment factor\u201d. The article explains the process as follows: \u201cFor example, in the Shanghai Women\u2019s Health Study, the prevalence of inactivity in all women at baseline was 45\u00b74% versus 51\u00b76% in women who died, yielding an adjustment factor of 1\u00b714 (51\u00b76\u00a0/\u00a045\u00b74\u00a0=\u00a01\u00b714). For each outcome, we calculated the adjustment factor in every study, and averaged this factor across studies. We applied the average adjustment factor to the prevalence of physical inactivity, by country, to estimate the prevalence of inactivity in cases of coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, breast and colon cancer, and death from any cause.\u201d The straight average (add the 8",
