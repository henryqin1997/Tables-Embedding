Iodine 3 in black/silver When jumping from Level 2 to 3, any given model\u2019s rim and nipples are maintained, with the (roughly 60g) weight savings coming from Sapim spokes and an alloy freehub body.\u00a0 The good news for anyone shopping with a SRAM 1\u00d711 drivetrain in mind is that the freehub body makes up nearly 50g of the difference, meaning that a 2-level wheelset with an aftermarket XD driver weighs virtually the same as a similarly-equipped level 3 wheel (albeit without the snazzy ano and with slightly less-sturdy spokes).\u00a0 That\u2019s also good news for 26in shoppers, who find themselves limited in the Cobalt and Iodine to the second tier (the Opium is only available in 26in for the time being).
