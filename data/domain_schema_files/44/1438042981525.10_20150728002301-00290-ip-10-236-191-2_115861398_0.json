They love him so much that they\u2019ll transform just about any movie he appears in into a respectable hit, even if that movie is a poorly marketed (but well-reviewed) action movie based on a comic book that no one read. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised that \u20182 Guns\u2018 shot to the top of the box office, but we are a little. Oh, Denzel Washington, you always catch us off guard.

    "textAfterTable": "Although $27 million is far from the most impressive opening of the summer, it\u2019s pretty darn good for a non-sequel action movie with a generic title. \u20192 Guns\u2019 didn\u2019t cost too much, so it didn\u2019t need a massive opening. With Washington\u2019s star power (no one will ever give co-star Mark Wahlberg any credit for this), the film should be a minor hit, letting everyone in the Denzel business know that yes, this Oscar-winning actor should continue pumping out action films twice a year or so for the foreseeable future. In second place, \u2018The Wolverine\u2018 took a sizable drop, taking in $21 million. That\u2019s a little rough, but the film is only a day or two away from $100 million. International grosses should help ease the pain, but this is evidence that audiences are still feeling sore from \u2018X-Men Origins: Wolverine\u2019 kicking them in a butt a few years ago. And that brings us to \u2018The Smurfs 2,\u2019 which opened to $18 million, roughly half of the first film\u2019s opening. It seems that even kids are tired of these annoying blue monstrosities. Hooray? Yes. Hooray, indeed. In fourth place, \u2018The Conjuring\u2018 flew past $100 million, making it the highest grossing original horror film since \u2018The Sixth Sense\u2019 back in 1999.
