Forms from Quill and received them in 2 days which was great!!! the forms were perfect and just what I needed. Thank you Quill for your quick response Delivery that I ordered one day and received 2 days later. Keep up the good work!

Works well with most 1099 software., 149701=These 1099s were quality-printed and completely adequate for submission to the IRS. I never had a paper jam or any other sort of trouble getting the forms to feed through my printer. Using QuickBooks to print the forms, however, there was a slight problem. While the laser-printed lines were right on target on the form at the top of each page (they are furnished two-up), lines of print on the lower form were out of place. Since the top lines were accurate, using the QuickBooks printing adjustment feature was not helpful. Since the copy of the 1099-MISC going to the IRS uses the rubine red ink for the form itself, I was able to get by, but half of the recipient copies ended up with laser-printing on top of black form lettering. All-in-all, I was able to get by and the overall quality of the forms is enough to justify my slight frustration with their formatting. It is, of course, possible that my trouble was of my own making, so take the downside of this review with a grain of salt., 141615=I only needed six 1099-Misc forms. It seems such a waste to have to purchase 50 sets. I feel the same way, too about the W-2 forms. Smaller packs of say, 25, would be ideal for small companies such as ours. Thank you.}",
