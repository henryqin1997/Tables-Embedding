In some cases, even longer antibiotic treatment is necessary [13]. Fusobacterium spp. are commonly sensitive to the usual anti-anaerobic antibacterial agents including penicillin G, clindamycin, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, imipenem, and cefoxitin [7]. However, there is evidence of emerging resistance of some Fusobacterium spp. isolates to penicillins, carbapenems, and clindamycin [13,15]. The first description of a \u03b2-lactamase in Fusobacterium spp. was reported in 1985, and this was shown to primarily be a penicillinase with little activity against cephalosporins [15]. Since then, several studies have reported \u03b2-lactamase production by Fusobacterium spp. Fatal sepsis due to a \u03b2-lactamase-producing strain occurred in an immunocompromised patient [16]. In studies done from 1999 to 2008, 0\u201314.6% of Fusobacterium spp. isolates were found to be nonsusceptible to penicillin [17,24]. The nonsusceptibility to \u03b2-lactam-\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors was found to be much lower (0-3.3%) [18-22]. There were regional differences between species in terms of penicillin resistance, but resistance to \u03b2-lactam-\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors was similarly low in different regions [24]. Recently, as Bacteroides spp. have become more resistant to carbapenem, carbapenem resistance in Fusobacterium spp. has also been reported. In a study from Taiwan, 4% of Fusobacteria isolates were \u201cnonsusceptible\u201d to imipenem and 8% were \u201cnonsusceptible\u201d to meropenem [17]. Our patient was successfully treated with \u03b2-lactam-\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors. The duration of antibiotic therapy is debated, but prolonged duration of high-dose \u03b2-lactam therapy is recommended because of the endovascular nature of the infection. Surgical debridement is crucial given the tendency toward abscess formation [7]., 29493=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/12/161/prepub, 45346=\u00a9 2009-2015 BioMedSearch.com.
