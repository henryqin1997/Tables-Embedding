MSU is 19th in rushing defense against a fairly tough schedule\u2014they didn't play anyone in the nonconference but got stuck in a brutal SEC West (or \"Legends,\" whatever)\u2014and obliterated a few actual teams along the way: Blitz, blitz, blitz from everywhere. Eight guys on the LOS on first down run blitzing like nuts. On passing downs heavy doses of zone blitz, and on third and two there's a specific rollout contain blitz from a linebacker. MSU doesn't blitz like Michigan blitzes: as the changeup. The basic philosophy of the MSU defense is evident in their first drive against LSU. It's evident everywhere all the time but this is a particularly emblematic bit: Can the Bulldogs do this? They've got a shot. Diaz points out they won't\u00a0 be intimidated since their scheduled was littered with Heisman finalists, including the 6-6 controversy robot that won the thing. MSU held him to 70 yards rushing on 18 attempts and 136 yards passing in a 17-14 loss; if they do the same to Michigan and give up 17 points they won't be losing. \"With such a small margin of error, it might be our death.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all about gap control,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cThey do some pretty good things with their run game.

The ruthless math of blitzing is that when you're wrong, you're really wrong. Mississippi State has not found a way to defy this, but they're good enough that you're going to be in second and long lots and unless you rip off a long one you're not cracking 5 YPC even if you've got Cam Newton. They also managed to give up 24 points to a 4-8 Conference USA team a week after holding Florida to seven\u2014unpredictability is inherent in the system.
