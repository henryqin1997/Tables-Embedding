In terms of the set criteria, the Indians are tied for fourth in baseball with 17 high scoring games, including last night. Their record in these games is 16-1. The Rockies, aided by Coors Field, have had 27 such games, though they also have had the most losses of any team, going 22-5. A table containing all teams with at least 15 high scoring games this season is below. The Indians offense this season has been the poster child of overall inconsistency, according to fans on twitter. Even though the Indians rank sixth in baseball in runs scored, it seems like the teams scores a bunch in one game before using Erik Kiss bats in the following contest. As much as Indians twitter wants to complain about this issue, they might have to simmer down, according to the data.

Not surprisingly, the worst offense in baseball, San Diego, has the most of these unfortunate occurrences, scoring 3 or fewer in 69 games. The Indians are actually way down the list, tied for 21st, with just 49 games matching the criteria. Unsurprisingly, no team is so bipolar to rank in the top five in both categories.
