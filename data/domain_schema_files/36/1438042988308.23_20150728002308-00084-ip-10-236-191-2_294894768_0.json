The first centre to kick off was the BayanLoco Community Learning Centre which started training 18 students in October 2000. The Gworok Multi-media was set up in January 2001 followed by the Gwong Multi-Media Centre in October 2002. The last centre was the least successful among the three due to a lingering local political stalemate. Two additional community centres have registered with Fantsuam but their CLCs have yet to start their operations.}",

If no, why do you think they were not interested? How have you been able to use your skills after the training? Will computer training make any difference to people's lives in this community? Computer knowledge and skills are becoming more and more important. How do you think this will affect Kafanchan? What was the language used for training? Would you have understood the training better if another language was used? If yes, what language? How difficult or easy was it for you to understand new things? What new things did you learn from the training? What were the benefits of the training you received? When/where did you first hear about the computers? Video skills?

All the respondents said the training had improved their educational and social status. Some also attributed the training to an improvement of their skills in writing and speaking English. All participants at the video skills training wanted a repeat of the training and explore opportunities for self employment. However, using their skills for documenting community history and skills was not considered a priority by the participants. Increased access, particularly for women, to ICT facilities through IT training: Before the offer of scholarship to females for IT training, attendance at two CLCs (BayanLoco and Kagoro) showed that only 25% of the users were females. A few months later, both centres recorded higher female enrolment than males. The reasons for the initial situation were disclosed during a focus-group discussion with women users: They indicated that females were yet to be convinced of the immediate relevance of the facilities to their daily lives. The time schedule when the resource centres open is in conflict with the domestic priorities of the women. Some of the women observed that",
