For the central Coastal Plain climate division (which includes Johnston, Lenoir, and Carteret Counties), November 2009 ranked as the WETTEST November since 1895. Statewide, precipitation in November 2009 ranks as the 5th wettest since 1895., 19147=November 2009 was a little warm and very wet. Statewide temperatures were generally 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal while rainfall amounts were 1-5 inches above normal. The wettest areas were in the eastern and northern counties, where rainfall amounts for November were greater than 200% of normal., 19456=In a unique set of events, the remnants of Tropical Storm Ida brought heavy rainfall to central and eastern NC in early November. Much of the moisture and energy associated with those remnants then developed into a coastal winter-type storm that continued heavy rains for eastern counties., 21279=Precipitation for November 2009 Based on estimates from NWS Radar Data courtesy NWS/NCEP, 20711=Rainfall from the remnants of Ida and the secondary coastal storm brought widespread recovery to all reservoirs and most streams. A few groundwater wells in central NC have not fully recovered, but otherwise drought impacts were not observed by the end of November. Abnormally Dry (D0) conditions remained due to longer-term rainfall deficits in central NC and low groundwater level at monitoring wells in Orange and Moore Counties.
