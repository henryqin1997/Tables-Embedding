I see nothing at all wrong with splicing station data to make a continuous series: this is the only defensible adjustment in my opinion. Provided there is sufficient overlap (which BOM neglect) very close neighbours can be compared and combined. Not perfect, but good enough for Torok and Nichols, Della-Marta, and others, including me. From your description I followed a similar process to you in looking at adjustments, including looking at diurnal range. Here\u2019s another link: https://kenskingdom.wordpress.com/2011/10/24/the-australian-temperature-record-part-10-bom%e2%80%99s-%e2%80%9cexplanations%e2%80%9d/, 345543=Airport AWS January 1 2005 \u2013 present is the Alice Springs location reference site to which ALL other prior sites are adjusted into terms with. The adjustment process employed moves backwards in time from the reference site and forwards in time from it as data is added to the series. Therefore, Airport AWS post Jan 1 2005 until the next step (for whatever reason arises) will remain unadjusted for posterity and the raw data for it will be EXACTLY the same as the final series data. There is nothing untoward or ludicrous about that., 332555=The 1st +0.8 C Alice Springs Min step at 2004/05 is due to CLIMATE (seasonal vegetation change), 1847=First, Alice Springs.\u00a0 Here is a table showing 1943, when there was overlap between the old Post Office observations and the new airfield built for the war effort.\u00a0 Note that Acorn bears little resemblance to either of the raw data records., 334683=My calculation to isolate the daily adjustment to 2004/12/1 would be 23.9 (ACORN) \u2013 0.8 (step adj) = 23.1 (step removed). 23.1 \u2013 23.3 (Air) = -0.2. This gives a NET step/daily adjustment to 2004/12/1 of +0.6 (+0.8 + -0.2 = +0.6) and tallies with your \u201cDiff air\u201d value of +0.6., 334252=You seem to have isolated the +0.8 step change made to the 2002 \u2013 2004 range of 365d datapoints in the 365d diff column of the 2004/05 Alice Springs table although I wonder if you have the headings \u201cAcorn\u201d and \u201c365d av air\u201d transposed?, 1233=Ken Stewart, June 2012, 334495=Surely the 2004/12/1 365d difference would be 14.9 (Acorn) \u2013 14.1 (365d av air) = 0.8 because the ACORN data has had 0.8 ADDED TO IT over that range to adjust for the step change?, 327025=The lowest temperature for the new Airport was -0.1 on 19/07/2007, the only time the raw temperature for Brisbane has been below zero.\u00a0 Acorn has several below zero temperatures in the 1960s, and has the record low as -2.2 on 22/07/1951, an adjustment of -4 degrees.\u00a0, 333035=http://joannenova.com.au/2012/06/threat-of-anao-audit-means-australias-bom-throws-out-temperature-set-starts-again-gets-same-results/#comment-1072495, 335279=2005 and 31 Dec 2004 remain unchanged because 2005 is the last \u201copen\u201d site used as the \u201creference\u201d benchmark for step change adjustments.

I do agree with you that adjustments were made from step points, but these varied for each season and frequently for each month. Rutherglen shows this clearly. Moreover, the Percentile Matching algorithm appears to have made DAILY adjustments which average out over a year or a season to be the amount of the step change adjustment. Therefore, there are no step changes as such (except at the beginning and end of adjustment periods) visible in Acorn at the daily level: it is only by 365 day smoothing that I was able to see what was going on. The sudden ceasing of the adjustments from points such as January 1 2005 is ludicrous but shows they were adjusting from breakpoints., 338752=http://joannenova.com.au/2012/06/threat-of-anao-audit-means-australias-bom-throws-out-temperature-set-starts-again-gets-same-results/#comment-1071936, 351622=I understand that 2005 to now is the reference period, 328864=This entry was posted on June 23, 2012 at 11:03 am and is filed under Uncategorized.

I understand that 2005 to now is the reference period, what I find ludicrous is that they didn\u2019t taper off the adjustments during 2004 but continued right up to 31/12, so there is an abrupt change rather than a tapering off. Not much hope of statistical analysis until we have access to the full data, comparison sites, adjustment explanations etc in a few months time.
