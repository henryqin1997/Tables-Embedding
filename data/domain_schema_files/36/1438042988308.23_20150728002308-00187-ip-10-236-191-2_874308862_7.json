    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{103126=MTS began work in March 2011 on a study to evaluate the feasibility of reconnecting Balboa Park, the San Diego Zoo and Downtown San Diego through a fixed-guideway, electrified streetcar line \u2013 the final study on the subject was published in October 2012.[38] The project study corridor runs between the City College Trolley Station area, and Balboa Park in the vicinity of the San Diego Zoo.[39] An alignment similar to the proposed one was last served by a streetcar system in 1949 on lines 7 (Park Boulevard-University Avenue to East San Diego) & 11 (Park Boulevard-Adams Avenue to Kensington).[40] The Committee evaluated what types of streetcars to use for this proposed line, the possible options including the recently ordered 57 Ultra Short 2011 S70s in the \"Modern Streetcar\" category, and the restored PCC Streetcars from the Downtown Silver Line in the \"Vintage Streetcar\" category.[41][42] The major construction issue was how to cross I-5 without having to reconstruct the entire bridge. The estimated cost for construction of this line was $68.2 million, with each trolley car estimated to cost between $850,000 (for a restored PPC trolley car) to $3.6 million (for a modern trolley car). Four cars are anticipated for service on this line.[43] No funding sources were identified. No further action on this proposal has taken place since the October 2012 release of the study., 28035=The debate between rail rapid transit and light rail was conducted without reference to any specific right-of-way or railroad tracks. The CPO\u2019s 1975 Regional Comprehensive Plan described a $1.5 billion rail-rapid transit system in San Diego featuring a system of 58 miles (93\u00a0km) and 11 lines. However, by this time, it was widely acknowledged by public officials that the BART-like system would be much more expensive than light rail. Rail rapid plans were stalled due to high costs. Proponents of the rail rapid system were concerned about the low speed of at-grade streetcar systems. Operating deficits were also a concern. A 1974 CPO study concluded that a streetcar system would incur operating deficits of $1.9 million annually. It was also understood that any BART-like system would incur substantial deficits., 81604=As of the Fourth Quarter (Q4) of 2013, the average weekday ridership on the San Diego Trolley system was 119,800,[5] making it the fourth busiest Light rail system in the United States. Taking overall track length into consideration, the San Diego Trolley transported 2,239 daily passengers per route mile in Q4 2014, making it the twelfth busiest Light rail system on a per mile basis over this time period. Weekday ridership on the Trolley has been relatively high since Q3 2013 (see table at right)., 90264=In addition to new LRVs, San Diego Trolley is also slowly retrofitting the SD-100s LRVs with new paint, door sensors & switches, wheelchair lifts, route display signs, and interior & exterior lighting. The oldest model U2 trolleys have very little that can be done to improve their functionality or operation as they lack the overhead equipment compartments found in the SD-100s and S70s, and were planned to be entirely phased out and retired by 2015. Eleven of these cars have already been sold to the upstart Metrotranv\u00eda Mendoza in Mendoza, Argentina with perhaps more on the way;[25] another 29 had been retired by early 2013,[1] and the rest of the U2 trolleys were retired from service in January 2015.[26], 88111=On September 24, 2009, MTS approved the purchase of 57 new model Siemens S70 cars, at a total cost of $205 million.[22][23] The cars began arriving in late September 2011 and are custom made model S70s. In 2012, the order was increased from 57 to 65 of these 'streetcar length' S70s.[7][24] The new vehicles are nine feet (2.74\u00a0m) shorter than the existing S70 vehicles on the system, making them the equivalent size of the older SD100 \"Boxed Shaped\" cars, allowing for three car operation in the downtown area. In order to run these trolleys on the older Orange and Blue Lines a platform renovation project has begun, starting with Blue Line stations south of Old Town, working its way southbound., 9490=The San Diego Trolley (reporting mark SDTI) is a light rail system operating in the metropolitan area of San Diego. It is known colloquially as The Trolley. The Trolley's operator, San Diego Trolley, Inc. (SDTI),[1][2] is a subsidiary of the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS). The Trolley began service on July 26, 1981,[1] making it the oldest of the \"second generation\" light rail systems in the United States. The entire Trolley network serves 53 stations, and comprises 53.5 miles (86.1\u00a0km) of route, and three primary lines named the Blue Line, the Orange Line, and the Green Line,[1] as well as a supplementary heritage streetcar downtown circulator known as the Silver Line that operates on select weekdays, weekends and holidays. In Q4 2014, the Trolley was the 4th most-ridden light rail system in the United States, with an average of 119,800 riders per weekday.[5], 26651=The planning for the San Diego Trolley began in 1966 under the auspices of the Comprehensive Planning Organization (CPO), an intergovernmental agency of 13 cities and San Diego County.[9] San Diego\u2019s streetcar system had been replaced with buses in 1949. In 1966 the local bus company, San Diego Transit, was facing a financial crisis and public takeover. The CPO developed a mass-transit plan to address the long-range transportation issues of the metropolitan area., 108517=The following Trolley and streetcar projects were included in the 2050 Regional Transportation Plan. The Plan's projected date of completion of each project is shown, but these dates are highly speculative since no specific commitments are being made in this plan, with the exception of the Blue Line Mid-Coast Extension which is currently under development.[46], 130887=Car nos.: 2001 \u2013 2052, 93162=The Trolley Renewal Project is scheduled to be completed in 2015.[24], 33039=On September 10, 1976, Tropical Storm Kathleen destroyed parts of SD&AE\u2019s Desert Line, at the time a part of the Southern Pacific (SP) system.[9] The hurricane caused $1.3 million worth of damage, primarily in the eastern part of the state. Through freight service to Arizona was suspended and San Diego became an isolated portion of the SP system. SP petitioned for abandonment of the SD&AE on August 9, 1977, of all tracks west of Plaster City, while the MTDB guideway planning project was ongoing. Due to the apparently immediate availability of a right-of-way in the South Bay Corridor, the transit planning refocused on the SD&AE (SP) Tijuana line, making it the effective \u2018minimum operable segment\u2019., 86253=According to figures from APTA, previous to 2014, the San Diego Trolley achieved the highest level of ridership in 2007, when there were 36,386,100 unlinked passenger transits on the system over that entire year.[20] The Trolley system's highest average weekday ridership of 124,300 was achieved in Q3 2007[21] \u2013 this corresponded to 2,323 passengers per route mile daily., 132397=First purchase: 2009/2012, 128498=In addition, one heritage (1946) Presidents Conference Committee (PCC) streetcar, Car 529, has been operating on the Silver Line since its opening in 2011;[6] a second restored (1946) PCC streetcar, Car 530, entered service on the Silver Line in March 2015.[50], 89381=The project entails raising the station from a track level (0-inch or 0-millimeter) or 4-inch (102\u00a0mm) raised platform to a 6-inch (152\u00a0mm) raised platform and placing a special \"safety tile\" with a smooth surface in the center, on the curb to allow for the wheelchair ramps to deploy without being damaged, as the existing \"safety tile\" contains rivets all the way throughout it. Some stations, primarily south of 12th and Imperial on the Blue Line, continued to board at track level through early 2015, and major re-construction was needed before low-floor trolleys could operate at these stations. Such improvements included brand new station platforms, station structures, rails, switches, signals, and overhead wires.[22], 131674=First purchase: 2004, 22409=On March 23, 1986, SDTI opened an extension east from Centre City San Diego to Euclid Avenue, along the La Mesa Branch of the SD&AE Railway \u2013 this new second line of the Trolley was then called the East Line.[8][9] Service was extended along the same line to Spring Street on May 12, 1989[8] serving Lemon Grove, and then to La Mesa and on to El Cajon on June 23, 1989.[8] Service from El Cajon to Santee, which does not operate along the old SD&AE right-of-way, began on August 26, 1995.[8][9], 105772=Since 2009, SANDAG has proposed a plan that would bring trolley service to Lindbergh Field. On January 19, 2013, mayor Bob Filner endorsed the idea, which spawned a renewed city interest in the project. In January 2013, SANDAG took steps to bring about a proposed extension to the Airport; MTS also had this idea in consideration for many years. One scenario of the plan would be an extension of the existing Orange Line from downtown to the southern portion of Lindbergh Field along Harbor Drive that would connect the Airport's terminals to trolley service. Another proposed scenario would bring service to the northern portion of the Airport and connect with the Blue and Green Lines at Washington Street and/or Old Town in the near or distant future. The California High-Speed Rail line is also planned to terminate on the north side of the airport (in Phase 2, which has no timetable yet). There is no projected completion date for this proposed airport extension., 27243=Little progress was made in the decade 1966\u20131975. CPO continued to research options for addressing the region\u2019s transportation needs. Several prominent stakeholders submitted their own mass-transit master plans for the region. The alternatives studied in the decade included:, 29284=The creation of the Metropolitan Transit Development Board (MTDB) in 1976 with a clearly stated mission initially did not resolve differences between the many stakeholders. However, MTDB did analyze previous transit studies, and determined that the guideway system should satisfy the following principles:, 82451=In all of 2014, the San Diego Trolley provided 39,731,900 unlinked passenger transits according to the American Public Transportation Association (APTA).[5] MTS reported that there were 39,694,197 trips on the Trolley in Fiscal Year 2014 (FY 2014), a 34% increase over Fiscal Year 2013.[18] Of the Trolley's three lines, the Blue Line has the system's highest ridership with 15,094,878 riders during FY 2014, followed by the Green Line with 13,673,926 FY 2014 riders, and the Orange Line with 10,896,289 FY 2014 riders.[18] The Silver Line, operating only mid-days just four days a week (and with some service interruptions during the year), carried 29,104 passengers around the downtown loop in FY2014., 93772=On September 2, 2012,[30][31] MTS realigned trolley operations to allow for \"more efficient travel\" and to solve several issues with the previous operating layout. The Green Line was extended from its former western terminus in Old Town south to 12th & Imperial Transit Center's Bayside Terminal, eliminating the need for the Special Event Service Line, which previously ran on a similar route. The Orange Line's western terminus was extended to Santa Fe Depot while its eastern terminus was shortened to El Cajon Transit Center due to the line's low ridership to and from the Gillespie Field station. The Blue Line's northern terminus was temporarily shortened to America Plaza until the completion of the Mid-Coast Trolley extension project.[32][33] Not only does this plan ensure every line will stop or pass through downtown, but it also creates two \"universal\" transfer points, one at the 12th & Imperial Transit Center (at the east side of downtown) and the other at the America Plaza/Santa Fe Depot (on the west side of downtown)., 57659=The following table shows San Diego MTS fares,[13] effective September 1, 2008[14] (in US dollars):, 99620=SANDAG is planning an extension of the Blue Line[34] from the Old Town Transit Center 11 miles (17.7\u00a0km) to the University City community, which will serve major activity and employment centers such as the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) campus and University Towne Centre (UTC) shopping center.[35][36] This is part of the \"Mid-Coast Corridor Transit Project\".[37] Construction is scheduled to begin in 2015, and the Mid-Coast extension is slated to be completed and in operation by early 2019.[35], 5051=128 LRVs in Total 52 Siemens SD-100s (1993)[1] 11 Full Length Siemens S70s (2004)[1] 65 Streetcar Length Siemens S70s (2012-2013)[1], 35355=By late 1977, two major transit investment studies were under way focusing on the same corridor: the MTDB-sponsored \u201cGuideway Planning Project\u201d, and San Diego County\u2019s \u201cSD&AE ROW Feasibility Study\u201d., 39375=Construction of the San Diego Trolley proceeded incrementally. The initial construction of new track focused mainly in downtown San Diego. The work on the SD&AE railroad track is best described as \u2018rehabilitation\u2019. The MTDB replaced 40% of all ties, cropped and welded the jointed rail, constructed electric catenaries, and installed an absolute block signal system. To control costs, the San Diego Trolley ordered only 14 cars, and did not install \u2018mimic\u2019 boards or the on-train location equipment until after the East Line was completed in 1989. No new sidings were initially installed on the SD&AE segment, which had three passing sidings between San Diego and San Ysidro. Service started at 15-minute headways using the rehabilitated single-track line., 23948=The \"Bayside\" extension of the Trolley in Centre City San Diego opened on June 30, 1990.[10] The first phase of the Old Town extension, from C Street to Little Italy in Centre City San Diego, opened on July 2, 1992.[10] The second phase of that extension, running from Little Italy to Old Town, opened on June 16, 1996.[9][10], 8573=September 2012 Trolley service map (Silver Line is not shown, but it runs along the \"diamond\" shaped route downtown)., 40268=San Diego Trolley opened in 1981 with 13.5 miles (21.7\u00a0km) of operations on the South Line. Additional vehicles were purchased in 1983, and the South Line was mostly double-tracked by 1984, largely on the strength of demand for more frequent headways. The business plan\u2019s incremental building and funding approach was vindicated. The East Line opened to Euclid Avenue in 1986, and was extended to El Cajon in 1989 and Santee in 1995. Service was extended northward to Old Town in 1996 and then eastward in Mission Valley in both 1997 and 2005.[10], 38630=In 1978, the MTDB successfully negotiated with SP to purchase the SD&AE for $18.1 million, including the $1.3 million required to restore the hurricane damaged freight line. This was a dual-intent decision, to preserve both rail freight services to the Imperial Valley, and to preserve available right-of-way for future transit use. In light of cheaper light-rail options identified in the MTDB and San Diego County studies, more expensive options such as a proposed $325 million rail-rapid transit line on a new right-of-way to the border seemed less competitive. There was universal agreement that using the SD&AE right-of-way and light rail technology was more economical and practical than a new rail-rapid transit line., 20230=Although electric rail service in San Diego traces its roots back to 1891 when John D. Spreckels incorporated the San Diego Electric Railway,[8] today's operating company, San Diego Trolley Incorporated (SDTI), was not founded until 1980[8] when the Metropolitan Transit Development Board (now operating as MTS) began planning a light-rail service along the Main Line of the San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway (SD&AE Railway), which had been purchased by MTDB from Southern Pacific Railroad in 1979.[8] Service began on July 19, 1981, with revenue collection beginning on July 26, 1981.[8] 14 trains operated on a single line between Centre City or Downtown San Diego and San Ysidro, with stops in the cities of San Diego, National City, and Chula Vista.[9], 30036=A feasibility study completed in 1975 identified the unit costs of guideway options, including the estimation of \u2018typical section\u2019 per-linear-foot costs for six guideway types: (1) cut-and-cover subway; (2) tunnel bore; (3) \u2018aerial line\u2019; (4) open-cut line with retaining walls; (5) sidehill berm cut line; (6) at-grade line. In addition, the MTDB\u2019s enabling legislation explicitly required the guideway system to satisfy the following criteria, consistent with the principles adopted by the Board: priority consideration shall be given to technologies available and in use; guideway system shall be capable of being brought into operation incrementally; transportation rights-of-way of public entities shall be utilized to minimize construction costs. The adoption of the principles effectively required either a \u2018light rail vehicle\u2019 capable of street running (to avoid grade separation), or a commuter-rail like design terminating at the Santa Fe Depot., 130178=First purchase: 1981, 96232=As of February 2015[update], eight Blue Line stations have been fully renovated and restored to service as part of the Trolley Renewal Project. Additional details and references can be found at the MTS Trolley Renewal page.[27] Current construction on the Blue Line for the Trolley Renewal Project includes:, 31406=The MTDB\u2019s enabling legislation also provided a dedicated funding source for guideway construction that would expire in 1981. Urgency was created since the dedicated funding would revert to the State highway fund if not expended on mass-transit guideway construction. In 1976\u201377, considerable planning efforts were completed. MTDB\u2019s 1977 \u201cGuideway Planning Project: Phase I Report\u201d identified many alignment options: Interstate highways I-5, I-8, and I-805; State Routes 94 and 163; railroad rights-of-way owned by Santa Fe (AT&SF) and by Southern Pacific/San Diego & Arizona Eastern (SD&AE); local arterials El Cajon Boulevard, 4th/6th/Genesee Avenues, and Highland/National/3rd/5th Avenues., 116694=Other Trolley projects in the 2050 Regional Transportation Plan involve more grade separations (from street crossings) for the Blue and Orange Lines, and the creation of more Express Lines on existing track.[46], 107751=The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) released a draft of its 2050 Regional Transportation Plan in April 2011, which was approved by the SANDAG Board of Directors on October 28, 2011.[44][45] Significant expansion of 156 new miles of Trolley service is proposed in the 2050 RTP,[44] as well as the creation of three new streetcar lines serving Downtown San Diego., 116091=A related project to these is the plan to build an Airport Intermodal Transit Center on the northeast side of Lindbergh Field by 2035,[49] which would include direct Trolley service access (from the Green Line, and from the Blue Line as well after the completion of the Mid-Coast Transit project) to San Diego International Airport. (Note: This is unrelated to the separate proposal to extend the Orange Line along Harbor Drive to the terminals on the south side of Lindbergh Field.), 130143=Car nos.: 1001 \u2013 1071, 130922=First purchase: 1993, 91578=The project is expected to cost around $660 million.[24][27] The new LRVs began arriving in late September 2011 and began running on the Green Line on October 3, 2011. Additional new LRVs began operation on the Orange line in January 2013, and will appear on the Blue Line in 2014. The project to expected be fully completed by 2015.[27] The final phase of the project began July 25, 2013 with a groundbreaking ceremony to kick off the construction to modernize the remaining unrenovated stations on the portion of the Blue Line south of downtown San Diego.[28] The low-floor Siemens S70 trolleys began operation on the Blue Line on January 27, 2015,[29] which coincided with the retirement of the last of the original U2 trolleys.[26], 25061=The \"Mission Valley West\" SDTI extension from Old Town to Mission San Diego commenced service on November 23, 1997[10][9] \u2013 it was at this time that the former South Line and East Line of the system were renamed the Blue Line and the Orange Line, respectively.[8][10] The \"Mission Valley East\" extension from Mission San Diego to La Mesa began operating on July 10, 2005,[10] with the inauguration of the third line of the San Diego Trolley system, the Green Line.}",
