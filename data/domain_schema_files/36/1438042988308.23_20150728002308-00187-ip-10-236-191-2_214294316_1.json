This is somewhat interesting, since it suggests well developed capital markets. Its 231 publicly-traded companies have an average size of about $1.5 billion. Also, there are enough Chilean companies that are traded on U.S. exchanges to dig further rather than just suggesting you invest in iShares MSCI Chile Investable Market Index (NYSEARCA:ECH). Furthermore, ECH exhibits a low correlation to SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY). Another ETF alternative is the Aberdeen Chile Fund, Inc. (NYSEMKT:CH). I previously wrote an article on investing in Latin American ETFs. I took a look at Chile and wanted to dig a little deeper. by: Bennington Investment Ideas \u00a0|\u00a0 Includes: AKO.A, AKO.B, BSAC, CCU, CH, ECH, ENI, EOC, LFL, MYS,",
