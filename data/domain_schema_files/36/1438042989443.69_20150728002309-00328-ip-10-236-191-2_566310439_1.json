    "textBeforeTable": "All roses were originally singles, composed of five petals, with the exception of one four-petaled species. As natural mutations occurred that replaced stamens and pistils with additional petals, semi-double and double roses appeared. These growing oddities (at the time) were saved and propagated by gardeners. Flowers of hybrid teas, floribundas, and other rose classes with China and Tea roses prevalent in their ancestry have a lower petal count, but their petals are larger and longer. These mature flowers have a much looser appearance than those of the Old Garden Roses. Today, a double rose with 17 \ufffd 25 petals is the norm. I began my romance with single roses many years ago \ufffd it was their wonderful simplicity that attracted me initially, and then I found out how easy they were to care for. The fuller the flower, the longer it takes to open, and if there is any moisture around, they can \ufffdball\ufffd up and never open at all, or worse yet, they can tend to attract Botrytis Blight and rot on the plant. While that is extreme, most roses with very full blooms don\ufffdt open unless they get a lot of heat. With few petals, the rose opens easily, and many of the plants are \ufffdself-cleaning\ufffd meaning that they drop their petals when they are spent, and there is less need for deadheading right away to keep the plants looking good. There is a long list of outstanding single roses that come from just about every type",
    "textAfterTable": "I have the good fortune to grow most of the roses on this list, and with minor exceptions, I can say that they generally perform better than roses with more petals. While the number of petals certainly has a lot to do with it, it is also related to their heritage, and since many are hybridized from species like R. eglanteria, the \ufffdSweet Brier Rose\ufffd and of R. spinosissima, the \ufffdScotch Rose\ufffd that have proven durability, they are hard to beat. You can grow ones like Kiftsgate that grows easily to 10 by 20 feet and is spectacular in bloom, to more modest sized versions like Mrs Oakly Fisher, staying about four feet tall, covered with thick, lush foliage that begins a rich plum color that is a great contrast to the apricot blooms. Regardless which you choose, you can\ufffdt go wrong with singles!
