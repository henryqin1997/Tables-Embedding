However, the Committee recognized that the relevant technologies are evolving, and the Project Plan explicitly encouraged innovative ideas from applicants. Potential applicants responding to the NIH AMP RA/SLE Funding Opportunity Announcements should NOT take the Project Plan as a blueprint. It is NOT meant to prescribe the research. Rather, it should be seen as a working draft, and both NIH and the Steering Committee welcome novel proposals to modify and improve the Project Plan., 107289=A 5-year program is proposed starting in late 2014. Start up activities will require approximately 6 months to reach the point of IRB approved protocols, selection and contracting with clinical centers, development of SOPs for sample collections and sample processing, analytical methods validation, selection and contracting with vendors. Similarly, the final 6 -12 months (2019) will be focused largely on completion of bioinformatics analyses, target validation by RNAi screening and report generation. The 4 years from 2015 through 2018 are the critical years for execution of this program. Based on the proposed activities and resources required during these years, this period will also consume the bulk of the program budget., 65087=Since biopsies from synovium (RA) and kidney (SLE) are small and will contain limited numbers of cells, separation of the main subpopulations of leukocytes would not be carried out. Instead, RNA sequencing to determine gene expression profiles would be performed at the single cell level as this technology is now emerging. The analysis would be carried out in two stages, first as a pilot study to perform single cell RNA sequencing on 1000 cells from each of 3 different synovial samples isolated by different technique (shaver vs. needle biopsy and surgical isolation). Analyses would be performed to determine if the main findings are revealed from the first 100 cells sequenced and if so, analysis of all subsequent samples would utilize 100 cells. Besides the single cell analysis, synovial fibroblasts (synoviocytes) are highly implicated as major contributors to joint damage in RA. These mesenchymal cells are readily separated from leukocytes by expression profiling and would be examined separately to elucidate molecular phenotypes (as outlined below). Multiplex, 3D immunofluorescence staining of tissue from the same tissue sample would be used to characterize the geographic distribution of cells. Additional methods that would be tested for feasibility would include phosphoproteome analysis and genome-wide approaches for analysis of epigenetic marks.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Table 1. Patient Cohorts in Phase 0, 1, and 2 The patient cohorts utilized in each of the three phases are described in Table 1. Several existing resources have been identified as outlined in Appendix A. Patient cohorts This project will require increasing the capacity to obtain target tissue and development of protocols for applying new analytic technologies to study the cells in the tissue. Once a tissue acquisition partnership is organized (Phase 0), two scientific questions will be addressed. In Phase 1, the goal is to develop a map of the molecular pathways active in specific cells in the tissue (and related cells in the circulation). Such a systems analysis does not require large numbers of samples if they are relatively homogeneous. At the same time, this Phase will also test the feasibility of the methodology. Once Phase 1 is complete, the focus will shift to identifying differences between subsets of patients (\"stratification\"), which will include comparisons of early vs. late disease, responder vs. non-responder, and subsets with different autoantibodies. How many different comparisons can be made will depend on feasibility, power calculations derived from the data acquired in Phase 1, and budget, as described in Decision Making in Section III. Strategy SLE and RA have common genetic risk alleles and abnormalities in both B and T cell functions. Thus, some disease-associated pathways are likely to be shared. However, some changes in these cell functions will differ between the diseases (even taking into account",
    "textAfterTable": "\u00a0 Phase 0 The goal of phase 0 is to establish the method of biopsy collection (in RA) and to demonstrate the feasibility of single cell analysis by RNA-seq in tissue (synovium and kidney). The biggest hurdles of the protocol are the quantity of tissue and homogeneity of tissue procurement, as most US rheumatologists do not perform biopsies. Assuming that US investigators are willing or have some capacity to do biopsy, these investigators should be able to prove that they can provide sample that will provide high quality RNA for downstream analysis. An alternative to this is to use investigators in Europe who do biopsies more frequently. The current state of RA biopsies is moving away from arthroscopic techniques of the knee into ultrasound guided biopsy of small joints. In fact several investigators have generated biobanks that have already confirmed the integrity of the RNA from these samples. The pathology of RA may not be fully represented with the large weight being joints (i.e. knee). Ideally, one would like to compare RA to healthy control, but that may only be possible with matched tissue from surgery, which implies some sort of damage (e.g. ACL, OA). The project would allow for other types of samples for comparison to help elucidate how the data may vary based on technical differences. This might include comparison of sample collection techniques (e.g. shaver vs. guided needle biopsy), different types of samples (e.g. biopsy vs. surgical), and various whole tissue processing techniques (e.g. histology/laser capture",
