It uses citations as a proxy (an admittedly poor one) of article quality and then compares the citations across journals. There are, not surprisingly, vast differences in the number of citations per article. While articles in the most elite journals receive more citations on average than the other less elite (but still highly regarded) journals studied, some articles in the less elite journals are more heavily cited than many articles in even the most elite journals. In keeping with studies in other disciplines and other citation studies of legal journals, the results here suggest that we should be wary of judgments about quality based on place of publication. We should also be wary of judgments about quality of scholarship based on the number of citations, and we should, therefore, continue to evaluate scholarship through close reads of it., 124145=July 7, 2008 in Law Review Rankings | Permalink | Comments (1) | TrackBack (0), 118674=July 16, 2008 in Law Review Rankings | Permalink | Comments (2) | TrackBack (0), 129983=July 6, 2008 in Law Review Rankings | Permalink | Comments (1) | TrackBack (0), 5933=November 19, 2012 in Law Review Rankings, Legal Education | Permalink | Comments (0) | TrackBack (0), 38826=Friday, August 28, 2009, 33971=May 3, 2010 in Law Review Rankings, Legal Education | Permalink | Comments (1) | TrackBack (0), 105621=The next U.S. News law school rankings aren't published until late March 2009, and we do not plan to make a decision on this issue until fall 2008 or early 2009.
