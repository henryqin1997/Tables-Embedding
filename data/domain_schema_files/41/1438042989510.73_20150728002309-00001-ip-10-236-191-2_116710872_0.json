But front-row starter James Hinchcliffe was eliminated in a multi-car accident on Lap 175. Grand Prix of Indianapolis race winner Simon Pagenaud ran solidly in the lead pack during the first 100 laps, but had his efforts blunted by a cut tire, leading to an unscheduled pit stop., 139233=The race ran at a record-breaking pace of more than 212 mph for the first 425 miles, and also set a new mark for completing the first 150 laps without a caution flag. Although there were a total of five caution flags in the final 50 laps \u2013 and a red flag on Lap 192 to set up the final dash to the checkers \u2013 the 21 laps run under caution tied a record for fewest yellow-flag laps, set in 1976. Even with the late-race cautions and 10-minute red flag period, Hunter-Reay's winning average speed of 186.563 mph is the second-fastest in Indianapolis 500 history, bested only by Tony Kanaan's winning average of 187.433 set in last year's race., 118087=Circuit: Indianapolis Motor Speedway (2.5-mile oval), Indianapolis, IN 2013 Winner: Tony Kanaan (KV Racing Technology) 187.433 mph average Weather: Sunny, warm, 79 degrees F, 142150=Ryan Hunter-Reay (#28 Andretti Autosport Honda) 2014 Indianapolis 500 winner: \"It's a dream come true, man. I can't even believe it. [about the battle with Castroneves at the end] There was no practice for it. We never really ran those lines all month and it was all new. Everything everyone was doing at the end [of the race] was all new. Winning it under green [flag conditions] like that was just a fantastic finish. We all raced each other clean, but really hard. I think that was a fantastic race. I hope the fans loved it because I was on the edge of my seat, for sure! Thanks to my team. I love driving for these guys and thanks to Honda, we had an awesome engine today.\", 137777=Hunter-Reay's victory was the first Indy 500 triumph in his IndyCar career, but the second for Honda in the last three years. Honda's last win was in 2012 with Dario Franchitti.

After running for the first 300 miles at the fastest pace in \"500\" history, a late-race red flag set up a six-lap shootout to the finish, with Hunter-Reay, Castroneves and the Honda-powered car of Marco Andretti in contention for the victory. Hunter-Reay and Castroneves traded the lead repeatedly in the final six laps, with Andretti stalking less than a half-second behind. Charging into the first turn at the start of the final lap, Hunter-Reay swept past Castroneves on the outside of Turn One in a thrilling maneuver. The pair ran nose-to-tail throughout the final three corners, but Castroneves was unable to find the speed needed to complete the pass before the checkers. Hunter-Reay's victory was the first Indy 500 triumph in his IndyCar career, but the second for Honda in the last three years. Honda's last win was in 2012 with Dario Franchitti.
