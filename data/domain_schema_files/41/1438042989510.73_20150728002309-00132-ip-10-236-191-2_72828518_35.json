If you elect to start depreciation in the period corresponding to the date placed in service, Oracle Assets starts to depreciate the asset in AUG-95, and the depreciation for each period is $200 ($2,000 divided by 10--the number of periods from August to May)., 57478=Similarly, the net book value at the beginning of the 1995 fiscal year is $7,200. Oracle Assets calculates annual depreciation of $1,440 and divides this amount evenly to get the depreciation amount for each period. Oracle Assets repeats this process until the asset is fully depreciated or retired., 78112=For monthly depreciation, divide the yearly depreciation by the number of periods in the fiscal year for which the asset is held. So, continuing with the example above, in the first year, the asset is held for 10 months (March to December) and the monthly depreciation is calculated as: Monthly depreciation = Annual depreciation *1/10, 68888=Suppose your fiscal year ends in May, you have monthly (12 period) depreciation and prorate calendars, and you want to allocate depreciation evenly to each period in the year. You place a $10,000 asset in service in the third period of your fiscal year (AUG-95) using the half-year prorate convention. Its life is 5 years and the depreciation method is 200% declining balance with a straight-line switch and a calculation basis rule of cost. Since the asset is using the half-year prorate convention, the prorate date is in December (the mid-point of your fiscal year) which corresponds to prorate period 7 in your prorate calendar shown in the following table:, 55260=Suppose your fiscal year ends in May, you have a monthly (12 period) depreciation calendar, and you want to allocate depreciation evenly to each period in the year. You place a $10,000 asset in service in the third period of your fiscal year (AUG-92) using a half-year prorate convention. The rate for the diminishing value (calculation basis of NBV) depreciation method is 20%., 74531=For the asset in this example, Oracle Assets uses a rate of 20%, so the depreciation for fiscal 1996 is $2,000 (20% of $10,000)., 191239=In the sixth year, the depreciation expense is 25,000 yen for the year. Depreciation expense is 7500 yen per month for the first three months, and 2500 yen in the fourth month., 178979=You adjust the asset cost in the US CORP book to 20,000 USD, leaving the salvage value at 2500 USD. You then Mass Copy the cost adjustment to the US TAX book. The following table shows how mass copy works in these situations:, 180937=You adjust the salvage value in the US CORP book to 1000 USD (cost remains 25,000 USD). You Mass Copy the salvage value adjustment to the US TAX book. The following table shows how mass copy works in these situations:, 175960=For example, in 1997 you buy a new radio for the luxury automobile you added to the US CORP book. To record this cost, you add an invoice of 500 USD. The adjusted cost is 50,500 USD, and the new salvage value is 50,500 * 5% = 2525 USD., 77806=For example, if the fiscal year is from January to December and an asset is added in March, the rate of depreciation to be used is the rate for period 3 in each year. So, for first year, the rate would be for Year 1, Period 3. For second year, the rate used would be for Year 2, Period 3 and so on., 26972=Qtr1-96 = Periodic Depreciation Amount + Missed Depreciation Amount = 438 + 1750 = 2188., 188760=For the first ten years, Oracle Assets takes an annual depreciation expense of (100,000 - 10,000) / 10 = 9000 yen. If there are four periods per year and you are dividing depreciation evenly, Oracle Assets takes a depreciation expense of 2250 yen per period., 66132=For example, some reporting authorities require that you prorate depreciation according to the number of months you hold an asset in its first fiscal year of life. In this case, your prorate calendar has 12 prorate periods and your rate table has 12 rates (one for each month of the year) per year of life. Other governments require that you prorate depreciation according to the number of days that you hold an asset in its first fiscal year of life. This means that there is a different depreciation rate for each day of the year. Thus, the number of rates in your rate table is a factor of 365. For example, the rate table would have 1825 rates for an asset with a 4 year life (365 x 5). This means that your prorate calendar must contain 365 prorate periods and correspondingly, your rate table must have 365 rates (one for each day of the year) for each year of life., 76008=Similarly, the rates for 1995, 1996, and 1997 are 19.20%, 11.52%, and 11.52% respectively. Oracle Assets calculates annual depreciation for these years as $1,920, $1,152, and $1,152 and divides these amounts evenly across all the accounting periods in the appropriate fiscal years., 25364=New Adjusted Cost for 1996 = New Cost - Recalculated Depreciation Reserve for 1995 = 20,000 - (20,000*0.1/4*3 + 1,000) = 20,000 - 2,500 = 17,500, 185582=During the normal useful life of the asset, the amount of depreciation taken per fiscal year depends solely on the cost less the salvage value. For example, you place in service an asset with a cost of 100,000 yen and a salvage value of 1000 yen. The asset depreciates using a straight-line method and a nine year life. Regardless of the depreciation limit, the depreciation expense for this asset is (100,000 - 1000) / 9 = 11,000 yen per year for the first nine years., 189028=In the 11th year, depreciation expense is also 9000 yen for the year, or 2250 yen per period., 20825=New Adjusted Cost for 1996 = New Cost - Recalculated Depreciation Reserve for 1995 = 20,000 - (20,000 * 0.1 / 4 * 3) = 20,000 - 1,500 = 18,500, 175252=Dates Placed in Service: 01-JAN-1990 until 31-DEC-1999, 23460=New Adjusted Cost for 1996 = New Cost - Recalculated Depreciation Reserve for 1995 = 20,000 - (20,000 * 0.1 / 4 * 3 + 1,000) = 20,000 - 2,500 = 17,500, 75135=If you elect to start depreciation in the period corresponding to the prorate date, Oracle Assets does not start to depreciate the asset until DEC-95, and the depreciation for each period from DEC-95 to MAY-96 is $333.33 ($2,000 divided by 6--the number of periods from December to May)., 56593=If you elect to start depreciation on the prorate date, Oracle Assets does not start to depreciate the asset until December. The depreciation for each period from DEC-92 to MAY-93 is $166.67 ($1,000 divided by 6--the number of periods from December to May)., 175504=Date Placed in Service: 16-DEC-1995, 51850=If you do not start your projection beyond the current period, the projection does not include your most recent transactions. For example, if the current period in your corporate book is JUL-92, and you request an annual projection starting with JAN-92, Oracle Assets projects depreciation expense based on the financial information for your existing assets as of the start of January 1992. The projection does not include some of the transactions you entered between January and June 1992. If instead you request an annual projection starting with JAN-93, Oracle Assets projects depreciation expense based on the financial information for your existing assets as of the start of July 1992., 84027=You also cannot enter production for date ranges which overlap. For example, if you enter production for 01-JUN-1995 through 15-JUN-1995, you cannot enter production for 15-JUN-1995 through 30-JUN-1995. You can enter production for 16-JUN-1995 through 30-JUN-1995., 56118=You can specify whether to start taking depreciation in the period of the date placed in service or the prorate date using the depreciate when placed in service flag for the prorate convention. If you elect to start depreciation in the accounting period corresponding to the date placed in service, Oracle Assets starts to depreciate the asset in AUG-92, and the depreciation for each period is $100 ($1000 divided by 10--the number of periods from August to May)., 195409=Copyright \u00a9 1988, 2010, Oracle and/or its affiliates.

    "textBeforeTable": "The following table contains asset setup information used in this example. Depreciation Example If the override fails, the system will roll back the depreciation for the asset. You first need to correct the override information in the interface table, then rerun depreciation. For example, if any assets became over-reserved during the overriding process, the override will fail and the system will return an error. Run Depreciation or perform adjustments (single asset adjustment and mass change) to incorporate the override data. Optionally run What-If Analysis or Projection to review the estimated depreciation amounts for that period. Define the override data in the FA_DEPRN_OVERRIDE table. In the FA_DEPRN_OVERRIDE table, enter all basic override depreciation information: BOOK_TYPE_CODE, ASSET_ID, PERIOD_NAME, DEPRN_AMOUNT, BONUS_DEPRN_AMOUNT and USED_BY. You can provide depreciation amounts for depreciation expense and bonus expense separately using the columns: DEPRN_AMOUNT and BONUS_DEPRN_AMOUNT. Define either DEPRECIATION or ADJUSTMENT in the USED_BY column depending on your requirement. Note: You can assign multiple override data for each asset as long as PERIOD_NAME and USED_BY do not overlap for records with a non-posted status. To override the system calculated depreciation amounts using the FA_DEPRN_OVERRIDE table: Select Save from the menu to save your work. The Status field displays the current status of the override record, which may be New, Post, or Posted.
