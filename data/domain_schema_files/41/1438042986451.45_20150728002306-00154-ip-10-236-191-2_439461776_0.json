Mr. Boehmer had participated in NASA\u2019s Teacher in Space Program, the same program that ultimately led to teacher Christa McAuliffe\u2019s inclusion as a crewmember on Challenger\u2019s final flight. Nine years in the making, it was commissioned in Washington, D.C. on June 25th, 1995. Since then, Blake has been used as a platform for enhancing traditional classroom education. Lessons are cross-curricular with an emphasis on cooperative learning and teamwork. Since entering service nearly 18 years ago, Blake has hosted an estimated 64,000 students., 56470=\u00a9 2015 Lehigh Northampton Airport authority. All rights reserved., 36108=Dubbed \u201cThe Pride of the Lehigh Valley\u201d by the volunteer employees of Mack Trucks, at its Research and Development Test Center adjacent to the Queen City Airport, Blake truly lives up to its nickname. The classroom demonstrates what is possible when an educational concept receives support from the community it serves. The idea for Blake would have never left the ground without the resources and talented workers from local businesses and corporations who have donated money, materials, and thousands of volunteer man-hours to the project. The Blake program has also received financial support from public and private donations. Until Parkland School District retired the Space Shuttle Blake Project in 2012, support for the program was on-going, allowing Blake to continue its missions and to make appearances at schools across the Lehigh Valley, at universities, educator conferences, corporate-sponsored exhibits, and other special events. Though the faces and logos of some Blake\u2019s partners have changed through the years, Lehigh Valley\u2019s own Space Shuttle Blake continued to receive sponsorship and help from the community it proudly served. Blake\u2019s role in education has transcended its ability to instruct and inspire children. It stands as an example of what is possible when an educational program receives wide-spread community support.}",
