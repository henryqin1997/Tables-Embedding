In recognising deferred tax assets, the Group has considered if it is more likely than not that sufficient future profits will be available to absorb tax losses and other temporary differences. Deferred tax assets of \u00a326m (2009: \u00a326m) have not been recognised in respect of losses, tax credits on dividends and other temporary differences due to the uncertainty of the availability of suitable profits in the foreseeable future. The principal items on which no deferred tax assets have been recognised are tax losses of \u00a392m (2009: \u00a397m). There is no expiry date on these tax losses. No deferred tax has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries except where it is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the forseeable future.
