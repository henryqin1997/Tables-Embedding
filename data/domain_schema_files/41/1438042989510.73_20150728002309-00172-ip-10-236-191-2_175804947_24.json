You can argue against the latter to a certain extent, but it\u2019s pretty hard to argue against the former: A 10-26 mark in the first half, a 12-21 mark in the second for a combined 22-47 mark that was third-worst in affiliated ball (Louisville, 22-51; N.W. Arkansas, 22-48)., 57152=The top four starters had a combined ERA of 4.75, which is nearly a run higher than the league average of 3.80. The good news is that just one of those starters was a 2010 draftee; the rest of the 2010 draftees were relievers. The bad news is that two of the other three starters were from the 2009 draft., 64425=Bold = 2010 Draftee\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Italics = 2009 Draftee * = DSL Graduate, 28712=Underachievement is a little more in the eye of the beholder. It\u2019s often the disconnect between expected and actual performance. While as a fan (disclosure: see first sentence in \u201cAbout\u201d below), I feel like this team underachieved, as prospect follower I have to allow for the alternate, more objective interpretation that perhaps some of these guys simply hit their ceiling. There just aren\u2019t very many guys that finished in Woodbridge in August that I don\u2019t expect to see again next April; nearly everybody that deserved a bump up to Harrisburg got one., 17182=Taylor has been a force all season long, displaying both power (18 HR) speed (26 steals) while putting up an OPS of .956. Originally a shortstop when he was drafted in the 6th Rd. out of Westminster Academy (Ft. Lauderdale, FL), he was converted to outfield in 2010 and has quickly evolved on defense to an elite level, most notably for his throwing arm where he racked up 23 assists last season and has nine so far this season., 16190=Yesterday, the Harrisburg Senators announced three of their players were named to the 2014 Eastern League All-Star Game., 75254=Our final 2010 look at the leaders, trailers, and outliers in the Washington Nationals minor leagues, with a focus on the level where the prospects shone the brightest, not counting some guy who made a tour for service-time reasons (*ahem*)., 27963=This, of course, would be unremarkable except that in Woodbridge, the 64-win P-Nats were 42-28 \u2014 third-best in the Carolina League behind 74-win Myrtle Beach (42-26) and 87-win Winston-Salem (48-23). When I dug into it in early June, I discovered that at least some of it was attributable to the offense hitting nearly 100 points better on the road than at home, which doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense since the Pfitz generally comes up as neutral in ballpark effects. Other factors are surely at play here, but it\u2019s interesting (at least to me) nevertheless., 30431=That\u2019s a natural segue to the Top 13* batters (* for 2010 Draft Picks, ** for DSL graduates). Full team statistics can be found here. *Another \u201cextra\u201d to catch a notable There are some bright spots if you look for them \u2014 Kevin Keyes and Jason Martinson\u2019s power, for example. Ricky Hague demonstrating he can play second base (.983FA in 35G). Michael Taylor living up to the hype for his defensive skills in center. But there are also things to pick that aren\u2019t nits \u2014 Taylor, Martinson, and Keyes whiffed a lot. The team\u2019s left fielders gave the team\u2019s centerfielders ample opportunity to show off their range., 64557=Obviously, the thing that jumps out is the usage of Russell Moldenhauer, the team leader in slugging percentage. With two catchers to evaluate (Freitas and Leonida), it was clear that when one would catch, the other would DH or sit, which begs the question: Why weren\u2019t Labrie and Moldenhauer rotating at first base? The most logical deduction is that Moldenhauer is a terrible fielder, given that Moldenahauer did not play defensively at all for University of Texas this year and only played enough to register 53 putouts in the three seasons prior to 2010., 16805=Holland was leading the team in appearances with 29 before his promotion, and had allowed just seven of 18 inherited runners to score while not allowing any runs of his own in 17 appearances. This is his second all-star appearance, having represented the Nats NYPL affiliate in Vermont in 2010, the same year he was drafted out of the University of Louisville., 65132=Seven of these twelve hitters were sent to the Florida Instructional League; a good sign that they\u2019ll be in Hagerstown in 2011 and perhaps one may even jump to Potomac (best guess: David Freitas). Folks in Hagerstown should have another decent season in terms of offense, especially as the GCL standouts are mixed in with this bunch., 16535=Dykstra is currently posting a .297/.369/.417 line for the Senators as the team\u2019s starting second baseman, where he\u2019s putting up a career-best 4.39 range factor. He was originally drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in 2008 out of Westlake, CA high school., 17627=The E.L. ASG will be held on July 16 in Altoona. Full rosters and further details can be found here., 31746=On to the pitchers\u2026 Well, at least there wasn\u2019t much in the way of mediocrity. The pitchers were either good or they were bad. And even some of the \u201cbad\u201d were pitchers had their moments of \u201cgood.\u201d The Matts are a good example of this. Swynenberg was terrific in April, pitching one of the best games of the year on the final Sunday of the month. Grace finished the season strong, capping off his season with eight shutout innings against playoff-bound Wilmington on the final Saturday of the season, a game that Steve Souza won with an 11th-inning grand slam.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "BATTERS Now, for the numbers\u2026 As some of you have noted already in the comments, the numbers haven\u2019t been pretty thus far. According to manager Patrick Anderson (via Byron Kerr), it\u2019s been \u201csome pitches up to some decent hitters\u201d (Felipe Rivero) and \u201cballs right on the nose right at people\u201d (Tony Renda). But it is what it is, the numbers don\u2019t always tell you the real story, and it\u2019s still early, right? Many of these things are true, or have a modicum of truth, but if I don\u2019t mock the coachspeak, who will? \u00a0 2014 18 Oct \u00a01 Response \u00bb \u00a0News and Notes Checking In On The AFL Road Trips Watchlist and Player Reports Too Old For",
