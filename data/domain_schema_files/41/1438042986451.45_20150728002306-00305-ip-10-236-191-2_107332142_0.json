In tandem with the victory, qualifying on the pole and leading the most laps earned Power 53 championship points, the maximum available, as he closed to within five points of championship leader Dario Franchitti, who finished fourth for Target Chip Ganassi Racing.\u00a0 Three races remain in the season. Continuing a six-season tradition of equality and reliability, all 28 Honda-powered drivers completed 7,478 miles this weekend on the punishing streets of Baltimore without a single failure of the Honda Indy V-8 engine.\u00a0 It now has been more than two years since a Honda in-race engine failure, the last one taking place at Infineon Raceway in 2009. At the start, Power fought off a determined challenge from the second-starting Graham Rahal, who briefly took the lead in the first corner.\u00a0 But after reclaiming the advantage in Turn 3, Power was in control for the rest of the 75-lap run, turning over the lead only during routine pit stops on the way to a 10-second victory over Oriol Servia.
