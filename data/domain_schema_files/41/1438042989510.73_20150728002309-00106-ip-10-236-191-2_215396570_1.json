MORE ABOUT YELLOWTAIL FLOUNDER The yellowtail flounder has a distinctive flat shape with both eyes on one side of the head. Its flatness and color mutability enable it to easily camouflage itself along the soft muddy and sandy bottoms where it lives in shallow waters. It grows up to 2 feet (61 cm) in length and has been reported to live up to 12 years. Commercial Sources Yellowtail flounder are found in the western North Atlantic, from southern Labrador to Chesapeake Bay. The main sources of yellowtail flounder are Canada and the United States. Capture Methods Yellowtail flounder come from marine fisheries, not fish farms. They are primarily caught with bottom trawls. Additional types of fishing gear include gillnets and dredges.

More on contaminants \u00bb Eco details:\u00a0 Since they live on or near the bottom, flounder and sole are usually caught by bottom trawls, which can result in bycatch and damage to bottom habitats. True flounders are found in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. In New England, flounders are now caught under an innovative new \u2018sector\u2019 management plan. Discards in the fishery have dramatically decreased, sector fishermen stayed under their catch limits for all groundfish species, and less gear was deployed compared to previous years. True soles are found in the Pacific Ocean. On the West Coast, soles are now managed under an innovative new \u2018catch share\u2019 management plan. Bycatch is down 75%, and conservative catch quotas have limited the catch of overfished rockfish. Additionally, an innovation boom in gear design and fishing behavior has helped trawlers avoid bycatch hotspots and keep sensitive species out of nets. Best choices",
