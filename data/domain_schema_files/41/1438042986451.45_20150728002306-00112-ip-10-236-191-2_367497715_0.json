Customer Reviews Write A Review 6.5' Full Douglas Fir tree, Unlit As far as artificial trees go it is ok. It is not as full as stated. I measure only 53 inches not 60. It is a little awkward to put together. There are 3 sections. The lower and center pieces are heavy and bulky. It took me 2 hours to fluff the branches. The lower section could use a few more branches but if you really pull them apart and arrange them carefully it looks ok. It's a little too low to the floor so we are putting a block of wood under it to raise it up so we can put larger gifts under it. When the light hits it a certain way the branches have a sheen to them that makes it look fake. No real tree shines when in bright light. The branches are wrapped in some kind of thread and it frays so be careful not to snag it. The hinges are not covered",
