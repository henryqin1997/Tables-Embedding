    "textBeforeTable": "HIT CHARADE The Giants manufactured runs in the seventh and eighth, and after Bumgarner, Santiago Casilla and Sergio Romo finished the game with a clean inning each, marking the second time in team history -- and the first time since Game 3 of the 1945 Fall Classic against the Cubs -- that the Tigers have registered no more than two hits in a World Series game. Bumgarner had given up 10 earned runs in eight postseason innings heading in, but he looked like a different pitcher against the Tigers' out-of-sync batting order. He gave up two hits and two walks, struck out eight and needed only 86 pitches to record 21 outs. One runner got in scoring position, and only four balls left the infield. Perhaps it's not, but each of the last eight teams that have taken a 2-0 lead in the World Series have won it all. \"I'm hoping we can get back in our rhythm. Hopefully, it's not too late.\" \"We didn't want to think negatively that it was going to affect us, but in reality, I think it's a factor that's costing us now,\" Cabrera said in Spanish. \"We're not playing with the same rhythm we had before. 2 of 2 3 2 of 2 .167 2 WS 2 of 4 19 1 of 4",

The Giants have always been known to have good arms.\" Several others took note of the good at-bats they've had and the bad luck that has followed. Like the two catches Gregor Blanco made in Game 1, or the bullet line drive from Cabrera that Pablo Sandoval snared with one on in the fourth in Game 2. \"We hit some balls pretty good,\" leadoff hitter Austin Jackson said. \"We just couldn't get anything to fall when we needed it.\" Others noted the opportunities they couldn't capitalize on, especially when Prince Fielder was thrown out trying to score from first on Young's double",
