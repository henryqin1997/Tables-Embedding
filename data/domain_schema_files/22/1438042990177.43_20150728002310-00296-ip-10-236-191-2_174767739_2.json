The recommendations closely follow the current International Standards Organization (ISO) Level II recommendations, and are fully compliant with both the Joliette extension to Level II and to the proposed modifications for the ISO standard. These recommendations are for data exchange and do not necessarily apply to data archive. Some changes have been made in this section in July 2003 to allow for existence of multiple fragments of data starting at different times (which is a possibility for some data transmission systems) and to ease usage with compression programs., 1444=This file provides information on the IAGA ASCII Exchange Format, adopted August 2001. Content includes some general information and description of the file header, comment records, data header and records, file naming recommendations, and sample data file (html and text)., 8588=Values beyond the time interval of the means being reported must be zero-filled i.e. 14:01:00.000 for 1 minute data for the 14th hour, first minute.

Files may be further defined with the remaining characters by using an underscore \"_\" to separate the standard name. For example, naq20020101dmin.min and naq20020101d_2-5min.min are both acceptable names for 2.5 minute definitive data from Narsarsuaq. File names must begin with the IAGA 3-Letter Code, Date, and Type of data. The Extension defines the Data Interval (monthly, daily, hourly, minute, or second data). The Extension is duplicated in the last three characters of the base name, so that if the Extension is stripped on compression the Data Interval is not lost. The file name only indicates the general data interval, specific information is contained in the file header Data Interval field (i.e. 2.5 and 1-minute averages are both \"minute\" data, 10 second averages and 1 second instantaneous are both \"second\" data). File names are composed of lower case a-z, 0-9, underscore \"_\", and dash \"-\" characters. No spaces, unusual characters (i.e. *, /,",
