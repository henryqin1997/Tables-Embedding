    "textBeforeTable": "Striking performance That would be starting pitcher Hiroki Kuroda, who did everything humanly possible to put this one in the win column for the Yankees. Asked to start on three days' rest for the first time in his Major League career, Kuroda responded by striking out seven batters in the first three innings, and by retiring the first 15 Tigers that he faced. Kuroda's final line included no walks and 11 strikeouts. He gave up three runs in 7 2/3 innings, but he was better than that. The Yankees' bullpen allowed two of his runs to score after he left the game. OK, how many Yankees \"stepped up\" on Sunday? The correct answer is: \"One.\" There was a lot of the usual talk that occurs in the wake of an injury to an important player, about other players stepping up in his absence. The more important the player is, the more talking there is about stepping up. This collective slump was going on well before Derek Jeter sustained a fractured left ankle in the ALCS opener. This was a devastating injury to the Captain, the spiritual center of this team. If it is true that the meek shall inherit the Earth, the members of this Yankees lineup are in for some serious real estate. What has happened to the offense that was second in",

The traditional term \"Bronx Bombers\" can only be used if sarcasm is intended. A baseball adage says that, \"momentum is only as good as the next day's starting pitcher.\" Every day in this postseason, the Yankees' starting pitcher has provided an uplifting performance. Some of them have been good, some of them have been very good, at least one has been classic. But in four out of seven cases, good, solid, momentum-generating pitching performances by Yankees starters have been wasted by a no-show offense. Among the culprits are some of the biggest names in Yankees universe. Robinson Cano is hitting .063, and Sunday set a postseason record when his streak of consecutive hitless at-bats reached 26. Curtis Granderson is hitting .115. Nick Swisher, not a newcomer to postseason hitting struggles, is batting .154. Alex Rodriguez is hitting .130. When he singled in the ninth inning Sunday, a huge cheer arose from the Yankee Stadium faithful. In some cases, this might also have been the sound of sarcasm. These are veteran hitters, being attacked in the same way by pitching staffs in consecutive postseason",
