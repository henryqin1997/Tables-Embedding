An estimated 75% of Egyptians are under the age of 25 with just 3% over the age of 65, making it one of the most youthful populations in the world.[2][3], 69201=The Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) has released high/medium/low population projections for 2011-2031 based on Final Results of 2006 Population Census.[10] The 2020 high variant is 92.6 million, the medium - 91.0 million, the low - 90.0 million. The 2030 high variant is 104.4 million, the medium - 101.7 million, the low - 99.8 million. However the information could be misleading as the 2013 population figure of 84.6 million is higher than the projected high of 83 million., 5125=Egypt is the most populous country in the Middle East and the third-most populous on the African continent (after Nigeria and Ethiopia). Nearly 100% of the country's 82.5 million[1] (2012 est.) people live in three major regions of the country: Cairo and Alexandria and elsewhere along the banks of the Nile throughout the Nile Delta, which fans out north of Cairo; and along the Suez Canal. These regions are among the world's most densely populated, containing an average of over 3,820 persons per square mile (1,540 per km\u00b2.), as compared to 181 persons per sq. mi. for the country as a whole., 142037=The CIA World Factbook lists \"Egyptians\" as 99.6%, and \"other\" as 0.4% (2006 census). \"Other\" refers to people who are not citizens of Egypt, who come to Egypt to work for international companies, diplomats, etc.}",
