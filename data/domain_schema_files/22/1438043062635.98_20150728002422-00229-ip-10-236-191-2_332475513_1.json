With a wider view of the area, it`s sensible to argue that moving a football ground from a residential area to a non residential area would be a good thing. However well established groups will have concerns about Brentford FC`s plans. Concerns were also raised about the height and power of the floodlights. One side will be incorporated into the roof of the stand, the other side will have to rely on pylons and be much more powerful than the current Griffin Park lights. Expect to hear about Sky`s \"for TV\" demands or Lux measurements at this point ! Capacity will be just over 20, 000 with possible but problematic expansion over the railway line. Built in will be a safe standing area of around 3-4000. To enable shared use with a rugby team, there may be a distance of 7m between the pitch and stands behind the goals. There are also plans to incorporate a hotel on the new site. All of this is in the proposal stage of course. Other concerns or talking points were focused on leg room and a possible footbridge over Capital Interchange Way. Fantastic but daft question of the night was phrased thus\u0085 \"can I see the M4 motorway from my seat ?\" - Oh dear ! No sir, you will be busy watching the football we hope .. Regulars from the current 4 pubs around Griffin Park will be able to claim cab fares to and from the new site. ( this is a joke) and there are no plans yet for a monorail - but we live in hope. The BIAS website will bring you more information as it breaks, and there will also be regular updates on Beesotted.co.uk SmiffyBee, 17847=Date:Tuesday February 5 2013, 12077=Impressive Brentford Beat Stoke (Monday July 27 2015), 12670=Brentford vs Stoke Match Analysis (Thursday July 30 2015), 12874=Benham Denies Rumours About Andre Gray (Thursday July 30 2015), 11688=Is The Brentford Defence Sorted?
