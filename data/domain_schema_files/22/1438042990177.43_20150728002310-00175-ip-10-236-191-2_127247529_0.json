Havre de Grace was bought for $10 million at Fasig-Tipton and Plum Pretty was purchased at Keeneland for $4.2 million., 13689=Over at Laurel Park, the feature race is the $300,000 Barbara Fritchie Stakes, which is a seven furlong sprint for three year old and up fillies and mares. That race is a very good starting place in looking for a leader in the female sprint category and this year\u2019s running came up very strong with Villette, who has won 4 of her last 5, Centique, who has won 3 of her last 4, Flattering Bea who passed a remarkable 9 horses from the quarter pole to the wire in her last race (at Laurel in Nov.), More Than a Cruise, who shows 11 on the board finishes out of 13 starts and My Wandy\u2019s Girl, who is taking a pretty big drop in class, all looking like threats to win. If I had to play it (and I won\u2019t touch it, too wide open), I might go with La Verdad, who after coming fourth in her racing debut, reeled off 5 straight \u201cby daylight\u201d wins, with one or two of them being blow outs., 25558=**** 2013 Breeders\u2019 Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf winner Chriselliam was euthanized last Friday in Newmarket, England, as a result of a foot infection, according to England\u2019s media racing authority \u201cRacing Post\u201d., 21976=2014 Record: 4-9 = 44%, 26746=2013 BC Juvenile Filly Turf winner Chriselliam had to sadly be euthanized, 22021=2013 Record: 20-59 = 34%, 22429=**** 2011 Horse of the Year Havre de Grace and dual Grade: 1 Stakes winner Plum Pretty both produced their first foals at Timber Town Farm near Lexington, Ky. this past week., 20911=Papa Turf is just 1 for 5 in his career but ran a strong second to the highly touted Indianapolis in his last. If he runs back to that race, he could be a serious menace in this spot. Cherubim blew the doors off a maiden field while winning by 3+ lengths and finishing six furlongs in a quick 1:08.2 in his Santa Anita surface debut (but was the second race in his career). \u201cHe was on the inside and it was his first time out,\u201d trainer Simon Callaghan said, referring to Cherubim\u2019s eighth-place finish in his debut Nov. 24. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure why he didn\u2019t run well on the synthetic (his first race), but we always felt he was a really good horse and he really showed it last time.\u201d\u2026.He would also pose a serious threat if he runs back to that last race. Roger Rocket broke slowly in his racing debut but came roaring down the stretch to get up by a head\u2026stretches out in distant and step way up in class but could run a surprisingly good race especially if he gets a fast early pace\u2026which he just might., 27134=\u201cThis mile race is a logical debut for the colt who wintered in Aiken and seemed to thrive on it. We shipped him to Todd Pletcher on Jan. 7, and he has been pleased with his progress. He has several five-eighths (works)\u00a0under his belt, and Todd says he is as enthusiastic as ever.\u201d Campbell said., 24471=Among the races being considered for Mucho Macho Man are the $750,000 Santa Anita Handicap March 8, and the $10 million Dubai World Cup March 29 at Meydan., 12609=In this week\u2019s Horse Racing Race of the Week, we will be taking a closer look at the 2014 San Vicente Stakes at Santa Anita in Arcadia, California on Saturday where a field of six has been assembled to go seven furlongs for $200,000., 16100=Race 5 \u2013 2:30 PM \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 24065=**** 2013 Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic winner Mucho Macho Man ripped a half-mile in :46.4 (out five furlongs in :59.2) last Sunday in a visually impressive work. No race has been selected yet as the strapping chestnut\u2019s next race., 27451=\u201cWe are looking at the New Orleans Handicap at the Fair Grounds on March 29, so this race is an ideal prep. We considered going to New Orleans for the Mineshaft Stakes on Feb. 22, but that would have necessitated two trips. More time and staying home makes more sense.\u201d, 36484=Born and raised in Southern New Jersey, I follow the NHL and other hockey leagues.

She has had the problem for a month and during that time every effort has been made to resolve it but unfortunately it was uncontrollable. The vets were unable to get the infection under control with the antibiotics.\u201d, 9882=February 14, 2014 by Gerard Apadula, 28158=2013 Belmont Stakes winner Palace Malice will resurface on March 8 at Gulfstream Park}",

She was a little keen and she didn\u2019t finish.\u201d Facing four others, Eblouissante led into the stretch but began to weaken late and was passed by Macha, who won by 1 1/4 lengths. The mammoth mare was making her first start since finishing sixth in Shuvee Handicap at Saratoga on July 20. Speaking of great mares family\u2019s , Eblouissante, a 5-year-old half sister to the great Zenyatta, ran a disappointing second Thursday at Santa Anita, beaten 1 1/4 lengths under Mike Smith at odds of 3-5. She will be taking on five other rivals in a mile and seventy yard Maiden Special Weight race. She is trainer by Steve Assmussen and will be ridden by Rosie Napravnik. Lastly, be sure to catch the fourth race at The Fair Ground on Sunday where Samantha Nicole, a full sister to the great Rachel Alexandra, will be making her racing debut. Laurel will also run the General George Handicap on Monday, which is another seven furlong sprint for three year olds and up for $250,000 but once again, at this writing, the field has yet to be drawn.

    "textAfterTable": "\u00a0 Analysis: 1) Rprettyboyfloyd\u2013 is still a maiden I know, but he\u2019s had two career races and in both of them he\u2019s demonstrated strong closing runs. In his debut on Jan 4, he made up almost eight lengths in the last quarter mile to finish second to the now highly regard Bayern (who smashed an allowance field, that included Tap It Rich, by 15 lengths yesterday) in a fast time (1:22.2). In his second race, he broke slowly but was coming with a full head of steam late to miss by a half length to another horse that looks to have a bright future in Chelios. I\u2019m a little concern that seven panels isn\u2019t far enough for him, but I\u2019ll tell you this much, he meets no such rival as Bayern in this race\u2026.edge in wide open horse race. \u00a0 \u00a0 2) Kobe\u2019s Back\u2013 has only run is stakes races through his brief three race career and shows a good, albeit distant; second to champion Shared Belief two starts back. Draw a line thru that last race where he was beaten a country mile\u2026.he stood no chance after clipping heels with another horse early in that race. \u201cIn his second race, he was second best, and in his third race, he clipped heels, so he\u2019s had a couple of excuses,\u201d trainer John Sadler said. \u201cI\u2019m anxious to get him started this week. He\u2019s doing really well.\u201d Debut win was impressive and has been absolutely scorching up racetrack",
