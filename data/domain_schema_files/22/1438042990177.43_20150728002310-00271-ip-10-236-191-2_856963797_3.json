The first variant of Ja\ua791alif (acutes-Ja\ua791alif ) is shown in the second table below. There weren't separate letters for K and Q (realized as K) and for G and \u011e (realized as G), V and W (realized as W). \u015e (sh) looked like the Cyrillic letter \u0428 (she). C and \u00c7 were realized as in Turkish and the modern Tatar Latin alphabet and later were transposed in the final version of Ja\ua791alif.[1], 39787=In 1939 the Stalinist government prohibited Ja\ua791alif, although it remained in use until January 1940. Ja\ua791alif was also used in Nazi gazettes for prisoners of war and propaganda until WW2 ended. However, the alphabet served until the 1950s, because most of the schoolbooks were printed before World War II. Some Tatar diasporas also used Ja\ua791alif outside of the Soviet Union, for example the Tatar bureau of Radio Free Europe., 42696=In 1930s Turkey became one of the numerous potential enemies of the Soviet Union. Even though Atat\u00fcrk's alphabet was different from Ja\ua791alif, for Soviet officials the Latin script was a symbol of the outer, bourgeois world. In 1939 Cyrillization of USSR was initiated. As was said, alphabet was switched to Cyrillic \"by labor's request.\", 21744=In 1928 Ja\ua791alif was finally reformed (see first table below) and was in active usage for 12 years. Some sources claim that this alphabet had 34 letters, but the last was a digraph \u042cj, used for the corresponding Tatar diphthong.[1] Another source states that the 34th letter was an apostrophe. They also give another sorting of the alphabet. (\u018f after A, \u042c after E)[2], 20098=In 1926 the Congress of Turkologists in Baku recommended to switch all Turkic languages to the Latin script. In April 1926 the Ja\ua791a tatar \u0259lif\u0299as\u044c/Ya\u00f1a tatar \u00e4lifbas\u0131/\u042f\u04a3\u0430 \u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440 \u04d9\u043b\u0438\u0444\u0431\u0430\u0441\u044b (New Tatar alphabet) society started its work at Kazan.[2], 60892=The \"Internet-style\" alphabet named Inalif after Internet and \u00e4lifba was convented in 2003 and partly it was inspirited by Ja\ua791alif. The main purpose of this alphabet was a standardization of texts, which are written only with English keyboard, without any diacritical marks. But this is not a simple transliteration of non-English symbols of Ja\ua791alif or modern alphabet. Non-English letters are represented like digraphs, soft vowels are represented like combination of the pairmate and apostrophe, excluding y, that firstly in Tatar writing represent \u0131 (\u044b), probably under the influence of Transliteration of Russian and grammar of the Slavic languages. Like in Ja\ua791alif, j represent [j], and zh is used for j of modern and \u01b6 of Ja\ua791alif. X isn't used in Inalif and kh uses instead of them. Other changes include: \u00c4 \u2013 A'; \u00d6 \u2013 O'; \u00dc \u2013 U'; \u00c7 \u2013 Ch; \u011e - Gh; \u00d1 - Ng; \u015e - Sh. The sorting of Inalif isn't published, but computer sorting consider to use English sorting. Inalif is used only on the Internet.[3], 56214=In 1955, 1958, 1959 and 1989 some people tried to create a new Tatar Cyrillic alphabet, adding letters \u049a, \u0492 and \u040e, to write the sounds [q], \u0263 (\u011f), and [w] and make Tatar spelling phonetic. Some offered to use V instead of \u040e. In 1990s those attempts failed, because at that period many Tatarstan statesmen wanted to restore Ja\ua791alif., 59862=In the 1990s some wanted to restore Ya\u00f1alif, or Ya\u00f1alif+W, as being corresponding to modern Tatar phonetics. But technical problems, such as font problems and the disuse of Uniform Turkic alphabet among other peoples forced to use \"Turkish-based alphabet\". In 2000 that alphabet was adopted by the Tatarstan government, but in 2002 it was abolished by the Russian Federation.[1], 43923=In 1939 Qorbangaliev and Ramazanov offered their own projects that planned to use additional Cyrillic characters. Letters \u04e8, \u04d8, \u04ae, \u04ba were inherited from Ja\ua791alif, but \u0496 and \u04a2 were invented by analogy with \u0429 and \u0426. \u0413\u044a and \u041a\u044a should be used to designate \u011e and Q. By this project \"\u011f\u00e4d\u00e4t\" (\"custom\") was spelled as \"\u0433\u044a\u04d9\u0434\u04d9\u0442\", \"qar\" (\"snow\") as \"\u043a\u044a\u0430\u0440\". In Ramazanov's project W (Ja\ua791alif V) was marked by \u0412 before the vowel, and \u0423, \u04ae in the end of syllable. Ja\ua791alif: vaq \u2013 \u0432\u0430\u043a; tav \u2013 \u0442\u0430\u0443; d\u0259v \u2013 \u0434\u04d9\u04af. On May 5, 1939 this project was established as official by the Supreme Soviet of TASSR. Surprisingly, \"Tatar society disagreed to this project\" and during 1940 July conference a Cyrillic alphabet was finally standardized. January 10, 1941 this project was passed. According to this version, \"\u011f\u00e4d\u00e4t\" was spelled as \"\u0433\u0430\u0434\u04d9\u0442\", \"qar\" as \"\u043a\u0430\u0440\". The principles were following: if \u0433\u0430/\u0433\u043e/\u0433\u0443/\u0433\u044b/\u043a\u0430/\u043a\u043e/\u043a\u0443/\u043a\u044b/ is followed by \"soft syllable\", containing \"\u04d9, \u0435, \u04e9, \u0438, \u04af\" or soft sign \"\u044c\", they are pronounced as \u011f\u00e4/\u011f\u00f6/\u011f\u00fc/\u011fe/q\u00e4/q\u00f6/q\u00fc/qe, in other cases as \u011fa/\u011fo/\u011fu/\u011f\u0131/qa/qo/qu/q\u0131. \u0433\u04d9/\u0433\u04e9/\u0433\u04af/\u0433\u0435/\u043a\u04d9/\u043a\u04e9/\u043a\u04af/\u043a\u0435 are pronounced as g\u00e4/g\u00f6/g\u00fc/ge/k\u00e4/k\u00f6/k\u00fc/ke. Similar practice were applied for \u0435, \u044e, \u044f, that could be pronounced as ye, y\u00fc, y\u00e4 and as y\u0131, yu, ya. Examples: \u043a\u0430\u043d\u04d9\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c \u2013 q\u00e4n\u00e4\u011f\u00e4t (satisfied); \u0435\u043b \u2013 y\u0131l (year); \u044f\u043c\u044c \u2013 y\u00e4m (charm). So, in Tatar Cyrillic soft sign isn't used to show iotation as in Russian, but to show qualities of vowels where they aren't determinable through vowel harmony. Unlike modern Russian, some words can end with \u044a, to sign a \"hard g\" after the \"soft vowel\", as in \u0431\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0433\u044a \u2013 bali\u011f (of the full legal age).[1], 40555=It should be noted that for 12 years of usage the Latin script, Arabic script (and not only Ya\u00f1a iml\u00e2, but \u0130ske iml\u00e2 too) also were used. So, one of the Musa C\u00e4lil's Moabit Notebooks was written in Ja\ua791alif, but one was written in Arabic letters. Both notebooks were written in German prison, after 1939, the year when the Cyrillic script was established., 57112=[ ]: letters that were scheduled to be added in 1989. However, the Tatar Parliament resorted the Cyrillic script in January 1997 (without adding these letters?)., 18226=In 1908\u20131909 the Tatar poet S\u00e4\u011fit R\u00e4miev started to use the Latin script in his own works. He offered the use of digraphs: ea for \u00e4, eu for \u00fc, eo for \u00f6 and ei for \u0131. But Arabists turned down his project. In the early 1920s Azerbaijanis devised their own Latin alphabet, but Tatarstan scholars set a little store to this project, preferring to reform the \u0130ske iml\u00e2. The simplified Iske imla, known as Ya\u00f1a iml\u00e2 was used from 1920\u20131927.[1], 43284=There are also several projects of Cyrillization. Ilminski's alphabet was already forgotten and it couldn't be used, due to its religious origin. As early as 1938 professor M. Fazlullin introduced an adaptation of the Russian alphabet for the Tatar language, without any additional characters. Specific Tatar letters should be signed with the digraphs, consisting of similar Russian letters and the letters \u042a and \u042c.[1], 19333=But Latinization was adopted by the Soviet officials and the special Central Committee for a New Alphabet was established in Moscow. The first project of the Tatar-Bashkir Latin alphabet was published in E\u015f\u00e7e (The Worker) gazette in 1924. The pronunciation of the alphabet was similar to English, unlike the following. Specific Bashkir sounds were written with digraphs. However, this alphabet was declined.[1], 7429=Ja\ua791alif, Janalif or Ya\u00f1alif (Tatar ja\ua791a \u0259lifba/ya\u00f1a \u00e4lifba \u2192 ja\ua791alif/ya\u00f1alif [j\u028c\u014b\u0251\u02c8lif], Cyrillic \u042f\u04a3\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0444, \"new alphabet\") was the first Latin alphabet used during the Soviet epoch for the Tatar language in the 1930s. It replaced the Ya\u00f1a iml\u00e2 Arabic script-based alphabet in 1928 and was replaced by the Cyrillic alphabet in 1939.}",

In 1928 Ja\ua791alif was finally reformed (see first table below) and was in active usage for 12 years. Some sources claim that this alphabet had 34 letters, but the last was a digraph \u042cj, used for the corresponding Tatar diphthong.[1] Another source states that the 34th letter was an apostrophe. They also give another sorting of the alphabet. (\u018f after A, \u042c after E)[2] On July 3, 1927, Tatarstan officials declared Ja\ua791alif the official script of the Tatar language, replacing the Yanga imla script. The first variant of Ja\ua791alif (acutes-Ja\ua791alif ) is shown in the second table below. There weren't separate letters for K and Q (realized as K) and for G and \u011e (realized as G), V and W (realized as W). \u015e (sh) looked like the Cyrillic letter \u0428 (she). C and \u00c7 were realized as in Turkish and the modern Tatar Latin alphabet and later were transposed in the final version of Ja\ua791alif.[1] In 1926 the Congress of Turkologists in Baku recommended to switch all Turkic languages to",
