Additionally, some series contain scenarios and artwork considered inappropriate for Western audiences. Sometimes the artwork is cleaned-up for foreign publishing, as was the case with The Electric Tale of Pikachu manga, but some Japanese publishers prefer not to have the artwork changed. Pok\u00e9mon manga (Japanese: \u6f2b\u753b manga), unlike the Pok\u00e9mon anime, does not actually refer to one specific manga or one particular piece of Pok\u00e9mon canon but, rather, an entire subcategory of comics written with their own storylines and interpretations of the Pok\u00e9mon world. These frequently have no connection to one another beyond their medium. Revision as of 08:53, 28 July 2014",
