Bacon reported any faculty members considering partial retirement should first contact Janet West at 4-2806 or jwest@unomaha.edu.\u00a0 The conditions of partial retirement are not spelled out in the Collective Bargaining Agreement; instead, faculty negotiate them individually.\u00a0 Janet West is gathering and sharing information about the terms of partial retirement agreements so that faculty members can enter negotiations well informed., 22223=I.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The meeting was called to order at 2:30 p.m., 44840=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The meeting adjourned at 3:20 p.m., 88224=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The PD committee's meeting with Dean BJ Reed of CPACS was cancelled because of an emergency. The committee will re-schedule its meeting in November with Dean Reed to elaborate the \"Community Engagement\" issue, its connection to a \"Scholarship of engagement\" and the RPT process.\u00a0 A packet of information will be distributed to the members of the committee in preparation of that meeting. Senator Benjamin-Alvarado reported on his meeting with AVC Smith-Howell regarding the institutional elements of Faculty Development at UNO. This included a discussion of the extent to which faculty have had utilized institutional resources. This information was shared with the members of the committee who intimated that in many cases they had made extensive use of the teaching resources available but felt that the research resources for faculty development had been less useful. Senator Benjamin-Alvarado will sit on a Faculty Development Advisory Board with AVC Smith-Howell and others to address this and other relevant issues. The committee as a whole hopes to meet with AVC Smith-Howell in the coming month.\u00a0 The committee continued its discussion of the \"community engagement\" issue and the sense of the committee was that what little information we had thus far, is too general in nature, and that the over-riding concern was to pose a question to the administration to ask \"why the emphasis on \u2018community engagement' at this particular moment?\", 72212=A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Committee on Academic and Curricular Affairs:\u00a0 Senator Johanningsmeier reported the committee met at 1:00 p.m. on Wednesday, October 28., 83990=D.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Committee on Goals and Directions:\u00a0 Senator Paterson reported the committee convened for its monthly meeting on October 21, 2009, at 2:30 PM in CPACS 208.\u00a0, 57173=2930, 45776=3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Board of Regents met October 23, 2009.\u00a0 The day began with items from the Business Affairs Committee. There was a presentation on Innovation Campus (the Old Fair Grounds between East and UNL's main campus). This was followed by a presentation by the four Campus Facilities Directors on Sustainability. Principles such as \"Building Green\" were mentioned. Of the 11 LEED projects (developed or in development) only one, Mammel Hall (LEED silver), is at UNO. By 2015 the goal is to reduce energy consumption/demand at UNO by 10% (same % for UNK and UNL, 25% for UNMC). Concerning UNO Transportation, I was interested to learn that UNL students have free bus passes. It was my impression that there was some confusion among the regents concerning the MetrO! Rideshare program (car pooling). I think that some thought that it was a bus pass program. It is my impression that some of the regents would be very supportive of a bus pass program for UNO., 83563=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The committee was asked to consider preparing a resolution requesting that the University Gender Equity Committee investigate the issue.\u00a0 The first draft was presented at the September EC&C meeting and was remanded back to committee then.\u00a0 The committee is working on re-wording the resolution and will present a resolution in November or December., 92485=ACTION: as noted below, prepare appropriate changes to Bylaws to Senator Holley nlt 30 November for presentation at the December EC&C and Senate meetings, 110265=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Project 2110 Time Capsule Letter to Community: a draft of a letter asking for items to be placed in the Centennial time capsule representing community partners, was shared. \u00a0It was suggested that the letter be sent to the community list used to invite people to the Forum since they already have an established connection to the university. It was also decided to include the \"save the date\" postcard for the Forum with this letter since they will go out mid-November., 95664=Minutes: (Buckley) Minutes of the July and September board meetings were approved.., 103043=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A presentation of the new website http://www.unoalumni.org/, \"Facebook\" page, and \"Twitter\" page was provided by Anthony Flott.\u00a0 Jamie Herbert said that the Connect Committee met in May.\u00a0 Herbert stated that the goal of the Connect Committee is to involve UNO alumni with UNO through UNO Alumni Association programs and activities. Mark Grieb reviewed the UNO Alumni Association and Thompson Alumni Center 2nd Quarter financial statements. Michael Kudlacz reported that donations are coming in for the AFROTC scholarship--one at $500 per semester, or $1,000 per year., 55457=2937, 75163=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the Spring 2010 semester the Library will be implementing Encore, a discovery tool which should make searching for library materials more transparent.\u00a0 An interesting article about the development of emerging discovery software can be found in the Chronicle of Higher Education:\u00a0 http://chronicle.com.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/article/After-Losing-Users-in-Catal/48588/, 93746=ACTION (Senator Barone)\u00a0\u00a0 Although Faculty Senate reaction to Rules Committee suggestions of a \"quick response\" option for Faculty Senate approval of Resolutions was ambivalent at best, the Rules Committee considers a \"quick response\" option for decision making potentially important in the current budget climate.\u00a0 So, we will try again, but only after developing an option that meets the concerns voiced in the Senate about the authenticity of electronically mediated \"meetings.\u00a0 The Rules Committee shares these concerns.\u00a0 The new option will be presented at the Senate meetings in December., 99127=B.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Academic Planning Council:\u00a0 Senator D'Souza reported the APC met October 23, 2009., 73678=B.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Committee on Educational Resources and Services:\u00a0 Senator Boyer reported the meeting was held October\u00a0 23, 2009.\u00a0 Members present:\u00a0 Boyer, Kercher, Laquer, Ritzman Siy, Wileman., 94792=AFCON met October 10, 2009 at Eiseley Branch Library.\u00a0 Those present were:, 114212=IX.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The meeting adjourned at 3:35 p.m. with announcements., 82110=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On November 1, an email, newsletter, and e-notes announcement will be issued detailing the specific elements addressed this year.\u00a0 In particular, the vision and dental coverages can be modified by the faculty/staff this year.\u00a0 The tobacco designation is also due to be verified this year.\u00a0 The life Insurance benefit is now 1 X salary up to $120k.\u00a0 Accidental Death and Dismemberment insurance will be separate from life insurance in January 2010, so if faculty or staff want that coverage it will be available to buy separately., 44940=2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chancellor's Council met October 22, 2009.\u00a0 There were two agenda items: (1) Work Force Alignment Data (2) Roundtable., 60239=2009 Retreat Item, 67047=*2928 (From 10/15/2008 EC & Admn Mtg:\u00a0 Chancellor Christensen said he would bring up Senate Resolution 2928, 10/08/08, concerning seeking alternatives to Lotus Notes, with the President's Council. John Fiene is aware of the problems and supports the direction suggested in the resolution.), 87912=E.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Committee on Professional Development:\u00a0 Senator Haworth reported the meeting was held October 25, 2009.\u00a0 Present: Senators Benjamin-Alvarado (Chair); Haworth; Hayes; Lamsam; Tisko, and Tixier y Vigil.\u00a0, 107580=F.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Strategic Planning Steering Committee:\u00a0 Senator O'Connell reported the committee met October 28, 2009.\u00a0, 69781=B.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Senator Laquer submitted the October 2009 Budget Report., 22793=1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Executive Committee and Administration (EC&A) met October 21, 2009, and began at 2:02 p.m.\u00a0 The Chancellor's replies to Resolutions 3003-3006, and the completion of Resolution 2998, were acknowledged.\u00a0, 58801=2909, 80333=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mollie answered a number of the questions posed by last year's resolution (Resolution 2961, 4/8/09: Create a Long-Term Disability [LTD] Task Force), and also new ones raised during the meeting from the committee.\u00a0 One of the vexing issues is that UNO H/R (Anderson and Scarpello) sometimes have problems getting utilization or incidence data from the NU Benefits office.\u00a0 For example, if they ask what the rate of diabetes is for UNO faculty and staff, that data is not readily available, but only available for the NU system as a whole.\u00a0 Also, one of the issues cleared up for some of the committee members is that the NU health benefit system is self-insured by the state, and that Blue Cross/Blue Shield (health benefits), UNUM (disability benefits), and EyeMed (vision benefits) are administrators only; the actual insurance is provided by the state.\u00a0 This answers some lingering questions about why the NU Benefits office might sometimes seem to be more interested in the cost side of health care/health insurance issues, rather than the benefits side.\u00a0 However it also raises new issues, such as why are we (UNO H/R or others) not able to obtain summary or detailed information regarding the UNO campus.\u00a0 This information could be used to develop a more focused Wellness plan.\u00a0, 111331=A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Senator M. Bacon asked about the Chancellor's and Board of Regents response to Resolutions 2370 and 2440 (Domestic Partnership Benefits).\u00a0 It was noted that the Faculty Personnel & Welfare committee is working on the Domestic Partnership Benefits issue., 95788=Treasurer's Report (McMurtry) AFCON's treasury has a balance of $2550.38, as of Oct. 9.\u00a0 The treasurer's report was filed for audit., 79674=C.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Committee on Faculty Personnel and Welfare:\u00a0 Senator Erickson reported the \u00a0committee met October 28, 2009.\u00a0, 20737=2009-2010 Faculty Senate, 112971=B.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Faculty Senate President-Elect Nominations Begin:\u00a0 Senator Mitchell nominated Senator Laquer, who accepted the nomination.\u00a0 More nominations will be accepted at the December 2009 Faculty Senate meeting.\u00a0 Voting will also take place at that meeting., 91920=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ACTION (All): complete contacts and provide to Lyn nlt 30 Nov outcomes; Lyn, 22374=II.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The minutes of October 14, 2009, were approved as submitted., 92061=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 will prepare a report for the Senate to be presented at the December EC&C\u00a0, 62200=*2944 (From the EC & Admin Mtg 1/21/09: The Chancellor supports the concept in Resolution 2944 on funding an UCRCA budget line but opined we wouldn't get it during the years of budgetary problems.) (6/10/09 Nancy Castilow wrote for Chanc. Christensen: \"One clarification related to\u00a0 Res. 2944, dealing with ongoing support of the UCRCA budget.\u00a0 I said that I was open to the concept and supportive of continued funding of the UCRCA budget, albeit we would need to review its\u00a0 funding during times of budget constraints, as we do with other such programs.\u00a0 The decision to fund and how much to fund remains the purview of the Office of Academic Affairs.\u00a0 I did not opine that the UCRCA budget line would automatically see no funding during years of budgetary problems.\"), 28886=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Elder updated the EC&A about what the Faculty Senate Standing Committees have been and will be working on.\u00a0 Academic & Curricular Affairs is working on On-line Worldwide, and will be meeting with Arnold Bateman later this term.\u00a0 Parking issues have been moved to Educational Resources & Services Committee (from Faculty Personnel & Welfare).\u00a0 V.
