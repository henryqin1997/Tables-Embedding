I made the deadline of the 4th, but I didn't have computer access prior to the meeting, so was unable to add my name before consensus was reached on the list of nominees. I messaged ahead to N0_Hat before the meeting started to let him know I was on the way and requested he inform Bfb, Chair of the election committee.",
            "The moderator of the weekly meeting should ask if people think that the prior weeks meeting notes are accurate and sufficient. (I invite amendments to the language - the purpose is to avoid confusion and shadow the procedure in formal meetings to approve the prior meetings minutes)",

The most recent version of all such policies and procedures shall also be posted at an appropriate page on the Noisebridge wiki. It shall be the responsibility of the Secretary to operate and maintain this system.",
            "1. Consensus items at weekly meetings can be stopped from advancing by three member stand-asides or one block. Those objecting are encouraged to meet with proposal author(s) to develop mutually agreeable alternatives. 2. Membership meetings shall be scheduled and announced in advance. If a proposal cannot reach consensus or resolution at weekly meetings it may be added to a membership meeting agenda with sponsorship of three members. To take effect a proposal would require approval of 75% of members present physically or by proxy. 3. All current associate members shall be converted to full members, and the associate membership role abolished.",

This change extends not only to our operations, but also to our bylaws, so that the effect is only a change of name but does not change the rights or privileges of any person or category of people.",

Items shall not be elegible for consensus unless they were recorded on the Current Consensus Items page on the Noisebridge wiki before 24 hours have passed after the end of the weekly meeting in which they were proposed. If a proposal is modified at a weekly meeting, it shall not be elegible for consensus at that meeting.",

(originally posted 2013/11/4 to discuss) Replace: Noisebridge's space shall be open only to members and associate members at any time. A member or associate member may at any time invite a person into Noisebridge and host that person at Noisebridge as long as that member or associate member remains at Noisebridge. No other person shall be permitted at Noisebridge at any other time. with: Noisebridge is open to Members, Associate Members, and guests sponsored by same, at all times. Any person who is not one of the above may be asked to leave if no Member or Associate Member present wishes to sponsor them at that time, with no other justification being necessary. People coming to Noisebridge who don't know anyone should be introduced to members who are present so that sponsorship can occur if members present choose to do so at that time. Noisebridge should present itself as \"open to public visitors and guests as often as possible\"."
