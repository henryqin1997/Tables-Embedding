This node was composed of two EC-250 temperature and conductivity sensors fixed to the wharf, one at a depth of 1.0 m below chart datum and the other at a depth of 9.5 m below chart datum (chart datum was at the level of the lowest possible astronomical low tide). The sensors were field calibrated in early September 2010, following their deployment on 25 August 2010., 72327=\u03b1small was assigned a value equal to the sensor accuracy quoted by the manufacturer; the other coefficients were multiples of \u03b1small that were chosen empirically by trial and error using early 2008 data as a training set. Table 3 lists the values of \u03b1 obtained.}",
