We know how it works, mind. After Christmas. Win, win, win, win. Premier League wrapped up by April. Same as it ever was. So, whilst Spurs may have seen a slight upturn in fortunes since Andre Villas-Boas was ousted, we can all sleep soundly that Spurs will enter 2014 with the same propensity for self-destruction that is so characteristic of the club. By March, they\u2019ll be screaming for Sherwood\u2019s head at White Hart Lane and Levy will probably oblige. We keep deluding ourselves that with the turning of the year, certain aspects of our lives must change. One person\u2019s faddy diet is another\u2019s nicotine patch. Regardless, we all know deep down that all this is as futile as resisting a hefty transfer bid from Real Madrid. Manchester United vs Tottenham Hotspur Southampton 0 \u2013 Chelsea 2 No such problems for Chelsea. The sales are due to begin and Mourinho is certain to tread over the throng in order to get that flashy new adornment he\u2019s had his eye on. And you know, he\u2019s happy to pay over the odds too. How depressing. That\u2019s Blue Monday, for you.
