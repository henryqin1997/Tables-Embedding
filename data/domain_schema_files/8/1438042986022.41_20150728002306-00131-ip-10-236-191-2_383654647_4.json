The on-board PCMCIA and CF sockets work. coreboot can boot from CF (the stock BIOS can't). Some problems remain, though. 9 The AMD GX (internally known as GX2 for some time) is actually the successor to the GX1. 10 Use the epia-m code for now (plus a few hacks, e.g. disable Firewire/CF slot, because they're not present on the board). 12 Except for some possible problems with SATA2 ports, everything should work. 13 See also http://www.linuxbios.org/pipermail/linuxbios/2006-November/017065.html. 14 These boards should work fine, but we have no confirmed reports on the mailing list so far, so we cannot tell for sure. 15 See http://www.openbios.org/pipermail/linuxbios/2007-February/018299.html. 17 Seems to be partially working, specifically eth0, eth2, the PCI slot, the USB ports, and the serial console are working. Other parts are not yet finished. 19 The Linutop does not ship with coreboot, but the code should work. 20 Fan-control doesn't work yet. 21 This is the AMD Geode LX reference board and coreboot reference implementation on the AMD Geode LX, contributed and maintained by AMD engineers. 22 The board can boot a Linux kernel currently, but there's no VGA support, yet. 25 Works fine, only smaller issues remain to be fixed. A list of known issues is available. 27 The JUKI-511P and ROCKY-512 both use the same code and target (targets/iei/juki-511p). Thus, both support the same features and have the same limitations: IDE, USB, ethernet, serial, keyboard and sound work, but there are problems booting from IDE1 (this patch may help), and VGA video doesn't work, yet. 28 Partially supported, almost boots a Linux kernel. Some issues still remain to be fixed, though. 29 Some boards have ROM sockets, others are soldered. 30 The irq table in CN is from VIA. You may need to run getpir to generate your own irq table. 31 Technologic Systems. 32 Used in the Neoware Eon 4000s thin client. 33 Used in the IGEL WinNET III thin client. 34 Used in the IGEL-316 thin client. 35 ROM chip package (PLCC, DIP32, DIP8, SOIC8). 36 ROM chip protocol/type (parallel flash, LPC, FWH, SPI). 37 ROM chip socketed (Y/N)? 38 Board supported by flashrom (Y/N)? 39 Interestingly flashrom does not work when the vendor BIOS is booted, but it does work flawlessly when the machine is booted with coreboot. 40 Broken v4 port, try the v3 port instead. The v4 version will be fixed at some point. 41 RAM must be matched exactly in each bank. 44 Boots MS-DOS fine using SeaBIOS, might boot Linux. 45 works fine with Linux, some ACPI issues with Windows needs to be fixed.}",
