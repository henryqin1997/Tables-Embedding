Trading was muted in the overnight session, with the major currencies locked in narrow consolidation ranges. Rates on the benchmark Italian 10-year debt have edged higher this month, pointing to a pickup in funding stress and warning the ZEW reading may fall short of expectations. While this may put near-term downward pressure on the Euro, follow-through is likely to prove limited. Indeed, yields themselves are a far timelier indicator of investors\u2019 confidence in Eurozone crisis containment efforts than the ZEW reading. Furthermore, traders are unlikely to commit to a firm directional bias until the outcome of this week\u2019s EU Leaders\u2019 summit. December\u2019s German ZEW Survey of investor confidence is in focus on the European economic calendar. Forecasts suggest the forward-looking Expectations index will continue to moderate, showing sentiment remains net negative but by a smaller margin. The gauge has closely tracked Italian bond yields, suggesting the evolution of the Eurozone debt crisis is the key trend-setter.",
