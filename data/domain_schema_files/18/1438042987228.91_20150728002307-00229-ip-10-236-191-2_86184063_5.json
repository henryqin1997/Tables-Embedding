If you are that writer, and you are still willing to help, please remove the asterisk. How to take a beat or remove yourself from one Review Docs_Project_workflow_-_beat_writing for more thorough details about what you'll need to do. These beats are essentially draft sections for the release notes document. (An annotated version of the Fedora 23 schedule for Release Notes is available at Releases/23/Schedule.) You're likely to have a developer contact and will be able to use the feature pages for your beat, as well as other resources. You can even start by pasting the release notes from your feature's page. So don't be nervous--just claim a beat! Beat writing is a good place for a new contributor to start working with the Fedora project. You'll learn about the next release of Fedora, but you don't need to be highly technical. Most of the work is done in",
