MX Status Status See Schedule Schedule Note that build renaming is optional. You can also choose to simply rebuild when it's time to release. However, by doing a rename instead of a rebuild, you will ensure that all downstream consumers who built their bits using your prior-to-rename build need not rebuild their bits too, and that their test results are all still valid. If you have no downstream consumers in the release train, or are not worried about binary compatibility between your RC and R builds, you need not adhere to this recommendation. To facilitate renaming builds (when required) and to ensure your build artifacts are up to date (that is, that upstream renamed builds your use as dependencies are renamed in your logs & config files), you can choose to use this script: renameBuild.sh. Simply run the script w/o options for a detailed explanation of syntax and several examples. Renaming Builds Released (renamed): RC build is done, promoted, and renamed to its final R name.
