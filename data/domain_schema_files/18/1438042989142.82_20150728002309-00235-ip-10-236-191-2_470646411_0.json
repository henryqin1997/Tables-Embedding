Fire is a great natural fertilizer? It recycles nutrients into the soil. There is no ecological equivalent to fire. No other type of natural or man-made action yields the same benefits. Climate change is leading to longer fire seasons and larger wildfires in some areas. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service manages more separate units of land than any other agency, and has refuges in or near every urban area in the United States. Wildlife has naturally evolved with wildfire. Most animals easily escape from fire and quickly repopulate burned areas.. Many plants and animals live in fire-adapted habitats, which rely on fire to survive and thrive.
