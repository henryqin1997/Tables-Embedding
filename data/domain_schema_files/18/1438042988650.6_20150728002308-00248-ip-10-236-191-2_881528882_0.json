            "Summary",
            "Requires that agricultural entities who make more than $750,000 a year must purchase any premium coverage without federal subsidies. For those entities with an adjusted gross income between $250,000 and $500,000, the amendment reduces premium subsidy coverage by 10 percentage points. For those with an AGI between $500,000 and $750,000, the premium subsidy coverage is reduced by 20 percentage points. Any entities with an annual AGI of less than $250,000 will continue to receive full subsidization by the federal government.",
            "Strikes the two years of direct payments to upland cotton that H.R. 1947 continues.",
            "Sunsets permanent authority for the federal crop insurance program, keeping the program authorization in line with other farm programs authorized in H.R. 2642.",
            "Sets the government guarantee target for crop insurance company profitability at 12%, the target recommended in a study commissioned by USDA, and caps reimbursements of company administrative and operating expenses.",
            "Places an annual cap of $50,000 for the total subsidy received by a farmer who participates in the Federal Crop Insurance Program and requires the recipient to be \u201cactively engaged\u201d in farming in order to qualify for the subsidy. Currently the government subsidizes 62 percent of the premium amount with no limit on the total dollar amount of subsidy received.",
            "Limits premium subsidies to those producers with an AGI under $250,000 and limits per person premium subsidies to $50,000. Caps crop insurance providers\u2019 reimbursement of administrative and operating at $900 million and reduces their rate of return to 12%. Introduces transparency into the crop insurance program."
