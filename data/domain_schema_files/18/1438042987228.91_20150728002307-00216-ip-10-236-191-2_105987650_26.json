This is also the goal of Dutchman Henk Knuiman, a former water carrier for Marc Coma, who has completed his previous eight participations on the Dakar in the top 20. This morning he is 22nd. It is a different story for Argentinean Pablo Rodrigues, 72nd last year, who started out with the objective of doing better in 2013. 'Cacha' is 26th just ahead of Joan Barreda and the Brazilian Jean de Azevedo who is taking part in his 14th Dakar, having returned to two wheels after several races in a car. The Dakar car category was also the aim for Britain\u2019s Stanley Watt, who had hoped to be a co-pilot this year. In the end, he is behind the handlebars of a KTM which he has ridden into 30th place so far., 15777=Cyril Despres now leads the Dakar 2013 by 13\u201916' from his team-mate Ruben Faria. 18\u201908' behind the leader, Francisco 'Chaleco' Lopez still holds on to third place. Ivan Jakes did not have a particularly impressive day, losing 5 minutes extra to trail Despres by 23\u201933'. Alessandro Botturi, 29\u201932' behind the Frenchman, occupies fifth place in front of Juan Pedrero Garcia, 44\u201912' behind the race leader. Frenchman Olivier Pain in seventh is the first biker more than an hour behind Despres; 1:07\u201912' to be precise., 631=Russian Andrey Karginov left the starting point of the special at 12.39 PM local time behind the wheel of his Kamaz truck. He was followed by Dutchmen Van den Bosch (DAF) and Van den Brink (Ginaf)., 8778=Tim Forman is British and this is his debut on the Dakar. He is not doing too badly at all, seeing as he is still in the hunt to tackle the dunes in Fiambala. In 32nd place, he is close on the tail of Australian Warren Strange and one of his countrymen: Stanley Watt. However, he is dangerously exposed to those pursuing him: Peruvian Felipe Rios is only 1 minute behind and Frenchman Alain Duclos, who is 7 minutes behind, must be have a terrible thirst for some sort of success, heightened by the frustrations he has suffered over the last few days. This must also be the case for Kurt Caselli, in 36th place, ahead of Frenchman Romain Souvignet who occupies a respectable place in the top 40 before one of the final determining points on the Dakar 2013., 6898=The first ten riders are still grouped within a 45 minute bracket, but the others are not too far off either, including certain \u201cfallen angels\u201d of the 2013 edition. Unfortunately, we have not seen much of Pal Anders Ullevalseter. He was seen in the top 5 during the third stage, but due to all the problems he has encountered this year, he has not been able to do any better. Like him, many other talented riders have also experienced misfortunes in the sand, from Javier Pozzolito, 11th, to Paulo Gon\u00e7alves, 17th, including Frans Verhoeven, 13th. They all enjoyed a good start to the rally, or have put in a good performance here and there, but have not been able to reach the summit., 18105=Yves Tartarin has been combining his enthusiasm for the Dakar since 1988 with, by and large, a smile but always unswerving loyalty. He is 32nd this morning with his BMW X6. This enthusiasm is also shown by William Alcaraz who has already raced the rally in almost every way possible. This year, he is going solo, because he is having to fight a lone battle on board his Polaris buggy. Nonetheless, he is leading the T3 category, ahead of Nicolas Duclos and S\u00e9bastien Delaunay, also in a Polaris, as well as Chilean Francisco Lopez Balart in a Can-Am Commander 1000 X\u2026 A category for small cars but big on courage\u2026}",
