Weak and fluctuating incandescence was seen from the S at night during 28-29 May. Emissions became gray in color during 29-31 May, and on 30 May very fine ashfall was reported in areas to the SSW, S, and SSE. On 1 and 2 June only white vapor emissions were noted. RVO recommended a Stage 1 Alert as a result of increasing seismicity and occasional gray plumes, incandescence, and audible noises. According to a news report (Radio Australia), up to 10,000 residents live adjacent to Ulawun., 258259=07/1990 (BGVN 15:07) Weak to moderate vapor emission, 330474=RVO reported that activity at Ulawun was low during 15-21 July. Emissions from the summit crater were light gray during 15-16 July, and then changed to white vapor during 17-21 July. RSAM from volcanic tremors had increased on 14 July and reached a peak of 700 just after 0300 on 15 July. RSAM then decreased to 80 on 21 July, which also marked the cessation of volcanic tremors., 280656=A pilot reported seeing ash from Ulawun on 3 November drifting ESE of the volcano at a height of ~3 km a.s.l., 107783=Minor vapor emissions continue in early 2000, 172882=\"During most days in December, the summit crater was covered by clouds. When the weather was clear, moderate to strong white vapour emissions were observed. Seismicity was mainly characterized by bands of low-amplitude, high-frequency, harmonic tremor.

McKee., 17620=RVO noted a further increase in the seismicity during 19-24 February, with overlapping tremor events and an increase in RSAM (Real-time Seismic-Amplitude Measurement). Volcano-tectonic earthquakes were recorded on 1, 3, 7, 8, 17, and 24 February, with daily totals ranging between 1 and 5. Low-frequency earthquakes were recorded almost every day, with daily totals between 201 and 646., 15312=This report discusses volcanism and seismicity at Ulawun between early 2010 through February 2011, a period when the volcano (figure 14) discharged several ash plumes to as high as 3-4 km altitude. In one case, ash plumes were seen in satellite imagery drifting for almost 200 km. Our previous reporting noted steam plumes and increased seismicity in February 2010 (BGVN 35:02), which followed a multi-year interval of comparative quiet (BGVN 33:03 and 34:10)., 251623=07/2000 (BGVN 25:07) Vapor emissions during May and June; moderate seismicity in June, 150630=\"Activity remained at a very low level in August. Emissions from the summit crater consisted of white vapour in weak to moderate amounts. Seismicity was at a very low level during the month.\", 332645=RVO reported that during 1 October-15 November activity at Ulawun was low; small volumes of white vapor and gray and gray-brown ash plumes rose 100 m above the crater and drifted S. Seismicity was low with RSAM values fluctuating between 100 and 150 units throughout the period., 221022=\"Intriguing seismicity, possibly indicating an eruption in the near future, continued in April and included periods of volcanic tremor. Amplitudes of discrete events were generally low, although a degree of cyclicity in amplitudes was apparent, with a period of about 8-11 days. Daily earthquake totals increased from about 600 to about 1,500., 8776=Highlights of behavior, August 2010 through February 2011. During 6-24 August, white and gray-to-brown plumes rose no more than 300 m above Ulawun, and fine ash fell on the NW and W flanks. Seismicity decreased compared to previous weeks., 263202=03/1988 (SEAN 13:03) Seismicity remains strong but no eruption, 204891=\"Previous Ulawun eruptions developed rapidly (within hours) to full-scale eruptions, including lava effusion and paroxysmal explosive activity culminating in the formation of pyroclastic flows. However, the 1984 eruption developed slowly from the first appearance of summit glow on 4 September, and no effusion or paroxysmal activity took place. The eruption reached a peak 6-9 September when mild, rhythmic, almost ash-free, Strombolian explosions took place every few seconds., 91322=October seismicity included tremor and numerous low-frequency earthquakes. Volcanic tremors were dominant during 1-4, 8-11, and 30-31 October. The low-frequency earthquakes can be characterized by RSAM data. On 1 October RSAM stood at ~30-40 units; steady decline brought the 7 October RSAM to ~5 units. On the 8th and 11th there followed peaks of over 20 units. After that RSAM declined steadily until it reached background levels on 20 October. On 30 October, RSAM underwent a sudden increase to ~20-30 units heralding the brief 1 November eruption., 30630=No MODIS thermal alerts were identified between March 2006 and January 2007 on the Hawai'i Institute of Geophysics and Planetology MODIS Thermal Alert System web site. The lack of thermal anomalies may indicate explosive eruptions, and not lava emissions. However, such activity has occurred at the summit in the past. One such episode, in November 1985, generated Strombolian activity and pyroclastic flows (figure 11)., 196100=\"At 2000, notification was received by radio from Ulamona Catholic Mission (figure 1) of a summit Strombolian eruption in progress, with ejections of incandescent lava fragments to heights of 300-500 m above the crater every few seconds. The eruption was reported to have begun at about 1830, following, or in association with, a rapid increase in the amplitude of the harmonic tremor., 81289=Phases of the 25-30 April eruption. Volcanism on 25 April consisted of a steady weak red glow, occasional rumbling noises, and thick ash clouds. This lasted until about 0530 on 26 April, when a small Strombolian eruption began. Glowing lava fragments ejected by frequent explosions were restricted to the summit's N and NE sides. Small pyroclastic flows occurred, but also failed to progress beyond the summit area. Ash clouds blew NW dropping very fine ash. The Strombolian activity lasted about an hour. Activity then subsided and noises became infrequent; but forceful ash-bearing emissions continued., 262266=08/1988 (SEAN 13:08) Low-level seismicity, weak vapor emission, 247796=03/2008 (BGVN 33:03) Mostly gentle emissions of white vapor; low-frequency earthquakes, 324286=RVO reported that during 1-9 May diffuse white plumes rose from Ulawun and Real-time Seismic-Amplitude Measurement (RSAM) values ranged between 70 and 100. During 9-10 May RSAM values distinctly increased, fluctuated, and peaked at 1300 units before declining back to 100 units. During this time local residents heard booming. On 10 May grey-to-brown ash plumes were observed., 119471=Activity on most days during January-March remained at a low level, with only moderate or moderate-strong thick white vapor emissions. Seismicity was low during the first week of January, the first three weeks of February, and the first three weeks of March; the seismograph was not operational at other times., 191347=\"Following the eruption of 17-28 November, seismicity at Ulawun remained at a moderately high level for the first half of December (500-1,000 events per day). By the end of the month seismicity had almost dropped back to pre-eruption levels., 327278=RVO reported that starting on 6 November through 30 November Ulawun produced pale grey and brown ash plumes that rose 200 m and drifted in multiple directions. Ashfall was reported on the N and NW flanks, in Voluvolu, Noau, Ubili (10 km NW), and Ulamona (10 km NW). Low rumbling was heard on 18 November., 302328=Based on satellite imagery, the Darwin VAAC reported that ash-and-steam plumes from Ulawun drifted SW and S on 30 August and 2 September, respectively., 339074=RVO reported that during 1-9 May 2011, diffuse white plumes rose from Ulawun and low to modest RSAM values occurred (70-100 units). During 9-10 May, RSAM values distinctly increased, fluctuated, and peaked at 1,300 units before declining back to 100 units. During this time, local residents heard booming., 260105=09/1989 (SEAN 14:09) Vapor emission and minor seismicity, 309970=RVO reported that increased seismic activity at Ulawun began on 7 June. During 18 June-2 July, mostly moderate-to-strong emissions of white vapor produced plumes that rose from Ulawun and seismometers recorded high-frequency earthquakes. On 22 June, noises heard in villages to the NE accompanied some of the earthquakes. On 28 June, an Intensity II earthquake was felt in areas nearby and accompanied by a booming noise. A team of officers from RVO and West New Britain Provincial Disaster Office informed communities on the activity status of Ulawun. On 30 June, RVO reported that the level of Alert at Ulawun was at \"Stage 2\", or that there was an increase in seismic activity above background level. During 1-2 July, roaring and jet noises were reported by people to the NE., 45577=No new activity was detected by MODVOLC as recently as mid-2004. This was the case despite reports of seismic activity and deflation during January-March 2003 (BGVN 28:03), as well as white vapor emissions and offshore effervescence (BGVN 28:09) and intermittent ash plumes during September-December 2003 (BGVN 28:11)., 261191=03/1989 (SEAN 14:03) Ash emission, seismicity, and glow follow heavy rain, 267632=04/1983 (SEAN 08:04) Increased seismicity, including volcanic tremor, 102325=An eruption during 28 September-2 October 2000 sends a plume to 10-12 km, 63174=Variable amounts of emergent vapor and minor debris flows at Ulawun were reported during January-March 2003 (BGVN 28:03). Rabaul Volcanological Observatory (RVO) reports, covering much of the period 14 April-5 October 2003, indicated the volcano remained quiet over this time, without emissions from the N-valley vent., 139791=\"There were some reports of weak night glow and sub-continuous noises on the night of 18 January. However, emissions were unchanged at 0900 on the 19th. A change had occurred when the next observation was possible, at 1300, when there were forceful emissions of dark ash clouds to 500 m above the summit. Continuous night glow and sub-continuous deep roaring sounds were reported from Nuau village and Ulamona Mission, both ~12 km from the summit, on the night of the 19th. The level of tremor increased by a factor of about two between 0300 and 0400 on 20 January. Visual activity from dawn (0530) onwards consisted of moderate volumes of grey/brown ash being forcefully emitted up to 1.5 km above the crater. The emissions varied in strength, and during an aerial inspection it was possible to see into the crater, which is elongated in an E-W direction, with its largest dimension ~100 m. No base could be seen to the crater, and the emissions were being released from very deep on the E side. Blue vapour was seen at times. Continuous rumbling and roaring noises were heard on the flanks of the volcano., 264329=05/1986 (SEAN 11:05) Tremor & low-frequency seismicity but no eruptions seen, 205931=\"Since 23 August occasional explosion sounds from the summit have been heard and occasional small ash clouds have been observed rising 400-500 m above the summit. Weak summit crater glow was reported on 25 August, and on the 28th provincial authorities were alerted to the possibility of further developments.\", 255484=09/1993 (BGVN 18:09) Vapor emissions; slight increase in seismicity, 266540=12/1983 (SEAN 08:12) Seismicity increases after M 6.4, 6.5 earthquakes, 126280=The increase in the level of venting activity . . . continued into May. Throughout the month the summit crater emitted moderate to thick white vapor, although there were occasional reports of gray and blue emissions on 17 and 18 May, and towards the end of the month. On 23 May, because of the ash cloud, pilots in the region were notified to \"exercise caution and to report any increase in activity including height and movement of the ash cloud.\" In addition, during most nights in the first three weeks of the month the crater emitted a red glow that remained weak but steady., 250607=03/2002 (BGVN 27:03) Isolated tremor episodes and slow deflation through March 2002, 265418=01/1985 (SEAN 10:01) Mild strombolian activity concludes eruptive phase, 138652=\"There was a decrease in the ash content and the volume of the emissions on 21 and 22 January, with moderate thick white vapour and occasional dark-grey ash clouds being gently released. Very light ashfall was reported from Sule and Nuau. From 23 January until the end of the month emissions were generally moderate white vapour, some blue vapour, and occasional light-grey ash clouds. At times of low winds, the vapour column rose to over 2 km above the summit. There was almost continuous weak glow from the crater at night. No sounds were heard during this time. Seismic tremor remained at moderate levels. There were some variations in the tremor level 26-27 January, producing slight 'banding' on Helicorder records., 211333=\"Reports from passing aircraft late in the day indicated that tephra emissions may have recurred in early or mid-afternoon. An aerial inspection at 1700 by an RVO volcanologist failed to confirm the presence of new ejecta on the volcano's flanks, but faint haziness possibly due to earlier ejection of fine dust was noted downwind. The emission plume at the summit was found to be white and normal in size., 60169=According to the Rabaul Volcano Observatory, the main summit crater at Ulawun released weak to moderate volumes of white-gray vapor emissions over the period 6 November-22 December 2003. The two north valley vents were quiet, with no emissions observed. The seismograph, restored on 31 October 2003; showed seismicity was low throughout this period, with small low frequency volcanic earthquakes and some high frequency volcano-tectonic events. The electronic tiltmeter, restored at the same time; recorded no significant changes., 308771=Based on observations of satellite imagery, the Darwin VAAC reported that an ash-and-steam plume from Ulawun drifted W on 25 December., 243878=An eruption commenced . . . on 4 October 1973. The first 36 hours included only quiet lava streaming down the S flank, from a small vent in the side of the south-westerly terminal cone erected during the 1970 eruption. Explosive activity followed, from 6-19 October, with a peak in ash content on 11 October, on which day three small nuees descended the SSW flank. Strombolian ejections of brightly incandescent bombs occurred throughout the explosive phase, at a rate increasing to about 20 per minute during 13-14 October, when peaks of about 600 m elevation were reached. Five explosive vents were active altogether, tending to lie NNE-SSW, colinear but offset to the south of the main alignment of 1970 vents. Lava flowed throughout the eruption. The early flows were very hot and mobile, but the final flow, which commenced at about the time of the nuees and followed the same path, was cooler and more blocky in appearance. The eruption ceased abruptly on 19 October. Volcanologists were stationed 10 km away during 6-7 and 9-22 October, and at least one aerial inspection was made almost every day. No significant tilt effects occurred before or during the eruption, and continuous volcanic tremor was already established by 6 October, when a seismograph was installed. The tremor peaked in amplitude on 11 October, coinciding with the period of nuee production and ceased altogether on 19 October., 257364=05/1991 (BGVN 16:05) Large gas plume and numerous weak earthquakes, 173943=\"Ulawun's summit crater was covered by clouds during most of November. When visible, weak-moderate white vapour emissions were observed. Vapour emission intensified during the last week of the month. November's recorded seismicity was mainly characterized by an average of 9 bands of low-amplitude, high-frequency harmonic tremor, each lasting 1-2 hours. The number and size of accompanying B-type events also increased with a maximum of 1,055 recorded on the 19th., 99137=Other notable changes in the character of the RSAM plot occurred at 2240 on the 28th, and at 0115 and 0240 on the 29th. The first two times correlated with behavior noted by the observer watching the summit crater. Specifically, at 2240 on the 28th the observer saw the first glow reflecting off an ash-cloud emission. RVO scientists mark this as the beginning of the eruption. At 0120 on the 29th, production of incandescent lava fragments intensified, indicating the onset of a Strombolian eruption., 321430=RVO reported that white and gray-to-brown plumes rose no more than 300 m above Ulawun during 6-12 August, and fine ash fell on the NW and W flanks. Seismicity decreased as compared to previous weeks., 315536=RVO reported that during 2-7 June occasional low roaring or rumbling noises from Ulawun were heard daily in areas on the ESE, SE, and S flanks. During 2-5 June white vapor plumes rose 800-900 m high. Very fine ash particles fell in Ulamona about 10 km NW on 3 June and some gray emissions rose from the volcano on 5 June. Emissions during 6-9 June were white and light gray, and continued to rise no higher than 900 m. Fluctuating incandescence from the crater was seen at night from the S side of the volcano. Ashfall was again reported in Ulamona on 8 June., 36282=During the week of 22-28 August 2005, Ulawun often remained quiet but also displayed continued restlessness. People from Tauke, on the S side of the volcano reported occasional low roaring, rumbling, and booming noises on 21-22 and 26-28 August. Emissions from the summit crater consisted of moderate volumes of thick grayish vapor released forcefully. Some traces of blue vapor were also visible, but no glow was observed. Seismicity fluctuated between low and moderate, marked by small low-frequency earthquakes and small sporadic volcanic tremors. Only one high-frequency earthquake was recorded. An earthquake was felt on 22 August by people from Tauke. Apparently the earthquake was not reported by the observer at Ulamona, NW of the volcano, suggesting it was local and focused on the S side of the volcano., 112785=Vapor plume present throughout September, 218074=\"Throughout the month, emissions from the summit crater were reported to be strong white vapours. During an aerial inspection 24 May a white emission column rose several hundred meters above the summit, but the vapours were not being emitted with any force. A plume 5-10 km long was formed by the emissions.\", 254352=07/1994 (BGVN 19:07) White vapor emissions and low-frequency tremor, 46711=Note that a 16 January 2001 VAAC report of Ulawun emitting a cloud, ashes, and 'flames' ~ 10.6 km altitude, which was not confirmed by satellite imagery or RVO, has not previously been mentioned in the Bulletin., 297395=RVO reported that activity during 1-2 March at Ulawun consisted of strong forcefully expelled \"gray-blue emissions\" from the main crater. Incandescence may have been visible at the base of the plumes. There were no emissions from the NW vent. Small felt earthquakes occurred and the sound of roaring was heard from nearby villages. According to the Darwin VAAC, RVO reported that activity increased at Ulawun during 1 and 2 March and ash reached ~3 km (10,000 ft) a.s.l. on the 1st. Ash was not visible on satellite imagery., 89890=Eruption on 30 April 2001 sends an ash cloud to a height of ~13.7 km, 268690=09/1980 (SEAN 05:09) Ash billows to 6 kilometers above crater, 171094=\"Dry tilt and EDM measurements were carried out on 2 and 12 January. Compared with the previous tilt measurements in June 1988 (SEAN 13:06), inflationary tilts of as much as 19 \u00b5rad had accumulated by 2 January. Further inflation of up to 16 \u00b5rad took place between 2 and 12 January. These tilt changes were recorded at stations within a few km of the summit. EDM measurements were inconsistent. From 11 January, mainly white vapour emissions from the summit crater were observed. On some days, emissions appeared to contain ash. The pattern of regular periods of seismic tremor disappeared and was replaced by occasional small B-type events., 244738=Information Contacts: Card 0850 (16 January 1970) Mr. Johnson, Acting Administrator, Territory of Papua and New Guinea.

Renwick, Geological and Volcanological Branch, Administration of Papua and New Guinea, Port Moresby, Territory of Papua/New Guinea., 220092=\"On 17 April, 5 periods of tremor occurred. After about 3 hours of very low seismicity, the first began at 1645. A distinct lull also preceded the third period. Tremor was mostly continuous, with total duration of about 280 minutes. Individual periods lasted about 29-106 minutes, and were followed by about 5 hours of frequent discrete shocks and discontinuous tremor. Beginning 18 April a gradual decay in amplitude and frequency of occurrence of the shocks was recorded. Possible small A-type events were recorded 20-29 April., 266737=11/1983 (SEAN 08:11) Five days of strong seismicity; mild explosive activity, 124169=\"Seismic activity in June consisted mainly of sub-continuous low-frequency tremor, with an occasional larger low-frequency earthquake. The RSAM monitoring showed that the seismicity level remained fairly steady throughout the month, with a slight dip in the middle. On a number of occasions, most notably on 9, 20, and 30 June, the activity almost totally stopped for short periods of usually less than an hour. The cause of this is not known. A small number of local high-frequency earthquakes continued to be recorded, although the rate declined during the month., 320307=RVO reported that diffuse gray plumes rose 200-500 m above Ulawun during 16-21 July. Volcanic tremors continued, but overall seismicity declined slightly. Real-time Seismic-Amplitude Measurement (RSAM) values remained at a moderate level., 296338=A thin plume emitted from Ulawun was visible extending N on satellite imagery on 23 November., 286129=An ash plume from Ulawun was visible on satellite imagery on 10 October at an altitude around 3 km, extending ~75 km WNW of the summit., 191444=Seismic and eruptive activity decrease in December, 282983=During this week, aviation sources reported Ulawun ash plumes. A 30 April volcanic ash advisory detected a possible narrow low-level plume extending ~50 km from Ulawun. Satellite imagery for 2 May indicated an ash-and-steam plume rising to ~4 km and blowing W at ~30 km/hour. The plume extended 80 km W of the summit., 93332=RVO staff in Rabaul established communication links with the volcano observer based near Ulawun at 1606 on 27 September after noting increased RSAM values. Data from Ulawun were transmitted to RVO every 20 minutes. The RSAM values led to discussions with civil authorities and directions to local residents throughout the night at two-hour intervals. During the process, alert stages one and two were declared. This resulted in evacuating the local population, an effort accomplished with the help of a local timber company. Assistance was later provided by the West New Britain Provincial Government. This time-line of events is contrary to preliminary information (BGVN 25:08). that relied on local news media., 265226=10/1985 (SEAN 10:10) Eruption produces slow-moving lava flows, 241858=\"A new eruption was first observed just after 1900 on 7 May, when intermittent glow was seen at the summit. This rapidly developed into explosions of incandescent lava fragments from the summit crater, which increased in intensity until by 2100-2200 a full-scale eruption was in progress. At this stage, new ejections were visible every few seconds and explosive sounds were prominent; the intensity was probably as strong as that during the peaks of the 1970 and 1973 eruptions., 288369=On 6 June, satellite imagery of Ulawun showed a plume up to 3 km a.s.l. and extending ~75 km NW., 250403=08/2002 (BGVN 27:08) Ash eruptions during August 2002; plumes visible on satellite imagery, 223472=\"A notable seismic crisis occurred 21-23 March. From mid-January until 21 March, seismicity had been fluctuating between 400 and 1200 B-type volcanic shocks of moderate amplitude per day, in an apparently cyclic manner with a period of 16 days. On 21 March, shocks occurred at the rate of about 800/day until 1700, when their amplitude decreased sharply. At 1930 their frequency started to increase, and from 2000 they became subcontinuous (1800/day) and moderate in amplitude. This high level of seismicity continued for about 38 hours before gradually decreasing again., 25156=Similar conditions continued through the end of 2007 with only minor incidental variation.

The plumes appeared white-gray on occasions and were unusually strong bluish white gray over the last three days of the period. Volcanic seismicity was low, with several strongly felt tectonic earthquakes on the night of 3-4 July. A large regional earthquake centered 45 km N of Rabaul affected the area on 16 July, leading to a large tiltmeter offset, which slowly recovered over the following days., 180184=\"The low level of visible activity continued during May, with weak emission of white vapours.

During the last few days of April 1978, a number of barely discernible events, probably of the same kind, were recorded (mostly on 27-29 April) and a few were seen every day until the start of the eruption. Somewhat larger events resembling short bursts of volcanic tremor occurred on 2-3 May. During the few hours before the start of the visible eruption on 7 May, patchy, weak tremor was recorded. This tremor became strong and continuous with the commencement of visible activity, and maximum amplitudes were recorded during the first night.

He went on to comment that the light at that time and the meteorological conditions were perfect for creating and seeing plumes. Discussion with RVO suggested that Ulawun often steams in roughly the same manner, but that atmospheric conditions are only sometime advantageous for seeing the plume. Tupper noted that \"In stagnant and/or unstable air, the plume might rise higher above the volcano, but be less visible to satellites (and be obscured by convective clouds); fresh dry-season airflow is by far the best for creating and spotting plumes.\", 328678=RVO reported that dense gray-brown ash plumes that began rising from Ulawun on 6 November ceased on 11 December.

Seismicity subsided 6-8 March but returned to a moderately high level during the following week, though with a change in pattern; the tremor periods being replaced with a succession of discrete, emergent events., 136361=\"Seismic activity consisted of low-level, sub-continuous tremor with almost no discrete B-type events. The CVO's RSAM (Real-time Seismic Amplitude Measurement) system was deployed at the end of January to monitor tremor levels. From 29 January until 6 February the tremor level declined markedly. The system was inoperative until 17 February, when the tremor level was about the same as on the 6th. Helicorder readings indicated that tremor level was fairly constant from the 6th until the end of the month. This level of tremor is lower, by a factor of 2-3, than that seen during the peak of activity in mid-January and is comparable to the levels seen in early January., 252895=05/1996 (BGVN 21:05) Low to moderate emission of steam continues, 89775=On 30 April 2001 a moderate-sized ash cloud from an eruption at Ulawun was visible on Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS), U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather satellite, and Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) imagery.

Heavy rains during February and especially on the 19th, 21st, 22nd, and 24th, caused debris flows on the NW side of Ulawun. The debris channeled into Namo creek and later swept down to the coast. Along its course it overflowed into Ubili village. Muddy water flowed into six houses built on concrete floors and left a thin sheet of dried mud a few centimeters thick., 196568=\"Seismic activity began to increase on 12 November with the occasional appearance of small discrete B-type volcanic earthquakes. These increased in size and number over the following three days, resulting in an official notification on the 15th of an increased risk of an eruption.

Consistently strong white vapour emissions from the summit crater commenced on 25 March, contrasting with the usually weak to moderate white emission. A report on 26 March suggests a brief interval of dark grey emission, but seismic records show no changes that could indicate eruptive activity. The decline in seismicity on 23 March was followed by almost 2 weeks of exceptionally low levels interrupted only by a brief increase, 30-31 March., 114314=The low-level activity of previous months persisted through April and May.

These produced fine ashfall to the SE. Sulfur dioxide plumes drifted SE on 5 and 31 January. During 23-26 February, gray ash plumes occasionally drifted NE, SW, and NW., 344004=2010. RVO reported that, according to Real-time Seismic Amplitude Measurements (RSAM), seismic activity increased on 18 May 2010. According to RVO, white vapor emitted during 1-20 May 2010 became thicker during 22-28 May. On 22 and 25 May, some plumes were partially gray.

Plumes on 11 December reached unreported altitudes., 38502=On 9 August a plume drifting to the S was visible on satellite imagery (figure 10). During the rest of August, the summit crater released thick white vapor. Seismicity was characterized by small low-frequency earthquakes. One high-frequency earthquake and small periodic volcanic tremors were recorded., 60705=Intermittent ash plumes during September-October, 233521=Australian radio reports that Ulawun began to erupt during the night of 6-7 October. Pilots saw ash \"billowing\" to about 6 km above the crater during the morning of the 7th. A police spokesman said ash was thought to be falling more than 30 km from the volcano. Police were considering the evacuation of Ulamona Catholic mission, the settlement closest to the volcano., 45124=Data acquisition and analysis. Reports from Diego Coppola and David A. Rothery provided analyses of MODIS thermal alerts during 2001 and 2002 (using the MODVOLC alert-detection algorithm) extracted from the MODIS Thermal Alerts website (http://modis.hgip.hawaii.edu/) maintained by the University of Hawaii HIGP MODIS Thermal Alerts team (BGVN 28:01). Rothery and Charlotte Saunders provided updates to 31 May 2004. MODVOLC data are now routinely available from the Aqua satellite (equator crossing times 0230 and 1430 local time) in addition to the original Terra satellite (equator crossing times 1030 and 2230 local time)., 295763=Volcanic activity remained at low levels at Ulawun during 15-21 August, with steam emitted from the summit crater.

RVO reported that several large earthquakes occurred during June and July (table 4). The largest of those were the adjacent 18 July earthquakes, a foreshock of Mw 6.9 and a mainshock of Mw 7.3. The latter, which was destructive, was the largest in about a decade. The Provincial Disaster Office reported significant building damage near the epicenter and in the town of Kimbe (65 km NW of the mainshock's epicenter, figure 14). The mainshock's epicenter was also ~45 km S of Pago volcano and 134 km SW of Ulawun. Many damaged houses had been constructed of bush materials, but some houses also included modern building materials. At least one death was reported. Numerous aftershocks followed the main Mw 7.3 shock., 216152=\"At times other than seismic crises, daily totals of volcanic earthquakes were about 1,500, although fluctuations, from 1,000 to 2,000 per day, took place at the end of June.\", 64516=Seismic activity had been low through January-February, but an increase was evident starting on 2 March. This was shown by an increase in RSAM values on the same day. The increased activity remained at low to moderate levels between 2 and 12 March. After that, it declined gradually, reaching low levels on the 20th. Due to technical problems with the only seismograph to monitor Ulawun, no analogue waveforms were recorded, making it difficult to ascertain the type of seismicity associated with the increased RSAM values. However, it is assumed that another of the sporadic volcanic tremor episodes recorded since the September 2000 and April 2001 eruptions was the cause., 254960=04/1994 (BGVN 19:04) Sharp increase in seismicity followed by strong dark grey emissions, 345255=RVO reported that activity at Ulawun was low during 16-31 December; diffuse ash plumes rose from the crater during 51-21 December, and white vapor emissions were visible during 22-31 December., 198813=\"An aerial inspection on 30 January revealed complex topographic changes in the summit crater. The lava dome formed early in the eruption was surmounted by a small cinder cone, and the flanks of the dome were draped with a mantle of scoria and ash. Lava flows formed an almost continuous moat around the base of the dome. There was no overflow of lava onto Ulawun's flanks, but the lava had almost reached the lowest point in the crater rim, at the head of the NW valley. A small pit crater was present near the SW edge of the summit crater. The volume of new lava and tephra in the summit crater is provisionally estimated to be 105-106 m3.\", 226262=\"The volcano was very quiet throughout December with only continuous moderate emission of white vapour from the summit crater.\", 98609=At 0240 on 29 November, the RSAM peaked at 8045 units. Thus, scientists inferred this as the time when the Strombolian phase of the eruption peaked. During the cover of darkness, ash clouds were just visible, initially illuminated by the glow and gradually by incandescent fragments. The latter became common by about 1200 on the 29th when ash clouds were seen blowing NW. The ash clouds began to become voluminous from 0100 on the 29th, coinciding with the intensification of the Strombolian phase of the eruption. The ash clouds were emitted forcefully, accompanied by loud roaring and rumbling noises., 165737=\"Mild, intermittent, eruptive activity continued in April. Ash emissions occurred 6, 8, 11, 20-22, and 28 April, but their ash content was low, and no significant ashfalls were reported. A strong correlation between activity and preceding heavy rainfall (as observed in March) was not evident. When not producing ash, the volcano emitted white vapours at moderate rates., 270266=On 16 January the Darwin VAAC reported that a NOTAM from Port Moresbly stated that Ulawun was emitting a cloud, ashes, and \"flames\" up to 10.6 km a.s.l. blowing towards the SE. In contrast, an ash cloud was not detected in satellite imagery, and the Papua New Guinea Volcano Observatory stated that recent volcanic activity was limited to low-level vapor emissions., 282115=The Darwin VAAC reported that a possible low-level ash plume was visible on satellite imagery on 14 April., 260650=06/1989 (SEAN 14:06) White vapor plume; seismicity decreases, 99587=The late-stage buildup also appeared in RSAM readings.

After 1800, RSAM values continued to rise and the instruments registered intense continuous volcanic tremor. Around this time the RSAM counts exhibited an artificial decline attributed to an overwhelmed event-counting system., 301712=The Darwin VAAC reported steam-and-ash plumes from Ulawun that were visible on satellite imagery on 25, 27, and 28 August.

Comparing Vent A to its appearance during 1993, the overall depth of the crater floor appeared to have risen, becoming about 100-150 m shallower. The fill consisted of older material that collapsed from the inner crater wall and possibly new ejecta from the current eruption. A prominent breach on the N crater rim was evident and may have been created by the N pyroclastic flow. Judging by its close proximity, this flow originated from Vent B. En-echelon cracks on the E end of the crater suggested inward sagging of that side of the crater rim. At the time of the inspection, few emissions escaped the vents; however, traces of white and blue vapor wafted from other areas inside the crater., 251991=12/1999 (BGVN 24:12) White vapor emissions and low seismicity, 58820=Tabulation of aviation reports issued during 2000-mid-2003, 145814=Increased seismicity has been observed at Ulawun, but surface activity remained limited to release of small to moderate volumes of white vapor until late September. Recorded seismicity since mid-August has consisted of numerous to nearly continuous, very small, low-frequency events. Larger events began to occur in mid-September. Periods of stronger seismic activity were occasionally separated by intervals of little seismicity, producing a banded appearance on seismograms. Similar seismicity has been recorded previously at Ulawun, and at Karkar prior to its 1979 eruption. Gas emission on 29 and 30 September was stronger, and brown plumes were reported., 248165=02/2006 (BGVN 31:02) Ash emission on 1 March, more than four months after last eruption, 11509=RVO reported that on 23-24 July ash plumes were observed., 257910=09/1990 (BGVN 15:09) Weak fumarolic and seismic activity, 263759=12/1987 (SEAN 12:12) Volcanic earthquakes increase; vapor emission, 81915=This was when RSAM (Real-time Seismic Amplitude Measurement) data became useful. According to the RSAM, after 1400 tremor levels increased exponentially until about 1800 on the 25th, when it began to fluctuate. The start of the fluctuations coincided with the beginning of a steady weak glow from the summit vent. Earlier, occasional forceful emissions of weak to moderate gray ash clouds had begun at about 0600 on the 25th, and occasional low rumbling noises began at about 1600. Activation of Stage 1 of the Ulawun Volcano Stage of Alert system was recommended to authorities at 0200 on the 25th., 73116=A NNW-trending plume was visible from Ulawun on MODIS imagery on 22 August 2002 (figure 6). The Darwin VAAC reported that on 28 August at 0732 a low-level ash cloud from an eruption at Ulawun was visible on satellite imagery. By 1532 the same day ash was no longer visible. According to a Post-Courier news article, ash eruptions had occurred on 26 August and during the previous week, but became larger on the 27th. As of the 28th, care centers were preparing for possible evacuations. NASA satellite images provided by the Air Force Weather Agency showed a NW-trending plume on 6 September (figure 7).

A period of sub-continuous tremor began 20 January and lasted for ~27 hours. The summit crater emitted small to moderate amounts of white vapor during the few times that the summit was visible., 12790=Very fine ashfall was reported on 30 May in areas to the SSW, S, and SSE. It was again reported on 3 and 8 June, ~10 km NW (in Ulamona). During 9-25 June, fine ashfall was reported almost daily on the NW, SW, and sometimes W flanks., 340866=According to RVO, white-to-gray plumes rose less than 500 m from Ulawun during 27 June-9 July 2010, and fine ash fell in areas to the SW, W, and NW. The Darwin VAAC reported that during 1-5 July, ash plumes drifted 55-195 km at an altitude of 3 km. On 28 June and during 5-6 July the volcano omitted occasional roaring noises. A slight increase in seismicity (above moderate levels) took place during 5-8 July., 90744=The single electronic tiltmeter located on the high WSW flank showed a steady change throughout October. The behavior could possibly be related to edifice inflation., 39442=During April-July 2005 white vapor from the main vent was common, and plumes were frequently visible on satellite imagery. On 6 April, a thin plume was visible extending ~ 55 km to the SW. On 19 May a small plume to an unknown height extended W. Plumes to unknown altitudes were again released on 3 and 6 June. Plumes rising to 3 km altitude were seen on satellite imagery on 6 and 21 June. The 21 June plume contained ash, and initially extended W and WSW; imagery about six hours later showed the plume blowing NW. A short plume was visible at ~ 3 km altitude during 22-27 June, and on 27 June a pilot reported that the plume extended 37 km. During 30 June to 1 July, thin ash plumes were visible on satellite imagery, but heights were not given. No noise, night-time glow, or emissions were reported during this time.

The first explosion produced a thick dark ash column, visible in the moonlight, that rose several hundred meters above the summit before it was blown to the N and NW, causing ashfall on the flanks. The second explosion was smaller but also produced a dark ash column. People on Lolobau Island, ~18 km NW of Ulawun, observed very weak, dull glow on the summit. The partially working seismograph picked up tremor activity during the time of the explosions.

Starting at about 0940 satellite imagery showed that the ash cloud spread to a width of ~110 km in an arc-shape oriented counterclockwise from the ENE to the WSW. The shape and width of the ash cloud were relatively constant until about 1840 when the ash cloud became too diffuse to separate from the surrounding meteorological clouds. At 0830 on 30 September ash emissions were limited to infrequent puffs.

There may also have been incandescence at the base of the plumes. There were no emissions from the NW vent. Small, felt earthquakes occurred and the sound of roaring was heard by nearby villagers. According to the Darwin VAAC, RVO reported that ash reached ~ 3 km (10,000 ft) altitude on 1 March. However, ash was not visible on satellite imagery., 24472=Low levels of activity continued from January through March 2008. Emissions consisted of thin to thick white vapor and with no audible noises and no glow visible at night. Seismicity continued at moderate level dominated by low frequency volcanic earthquakes. Variable amounts of white fume were emitted, sometimes forcefully. The two N valley vents continued to remain quiet., 141359=\"Seismic activity changed subtly at the end of December. Few low-frequency earthquakes were recorded, but there had been a gradual increase in low-amplitude, long-duration 'tremor events.' By the beginning of January, the increase had been such that the events had coalesced into sub-continuous very low-amplitude tremor. There was a brief return of low-frequency events 1-4 January, including some very unusual signatures. There were also indications of periodically stronger tremor at this time, although the signals could have been due to high winds. From the 5th onwards the level of tremor remained steady and there were only a few low-frequency events. Visible activity was normal, with small amounts of thin vapour being gently released., 177363=\"No significant activity occurred in July.

The ash content of the emissions was low, and the plume was only a few kilometers long., 342911=According to RVO, during 2-12, 16-19, and 23-25 June 2010 residents heard occasional low roaring or rumbling noises daily on the ESE, SE, S, and NW flanks. During 2-19 and 23-26 June, white to gray-brown plumes rose to ~3 km altitude (figure 15). The Darwin VAAC noted that between 3-6 June, the plumes extended up to 315 km W. On 16-17 and 19-20 June, white and gray plumes rose 1 km above the summit. Very fine ash particles fell in Ulamona (~10 km NW) on 3 and 8 June, and then fell daily during 9-19 and 23-25 June on the NW, W, and SW flanks. Throughout June, fluctuating incandescence from the summit crater was seen at night from the S, SW, N, and SE flanks. RVO reported that on 18 and 19 June, seismicity increased to a high level and was dominated by volcanic tremor.

During the last week of January, continuous background volcanic tremor was recorded. On the morning of 31 January the seismicity suddenly changed to distinct B-type events. Within a few hours the events intensified and became hard to distinguish due to signal overlap on the analog records. The intense seismic activity lasted for several hours and then declined to a low level. It remained relatively low, with distinct B-type events, until the morning of 2 February, when the B-type events intensified again. Afterwards, seismicity declined to a very low level. Distinct B-type events continued, but in very low numbers. A-type volcanic events also occurred throughout February, but the month was generally quiet., 136811=\"Activity . . . continued to decline following the brief phreatic or phreatomagmatic activity in mid-January (BGVN 18:01).

This was characterized by glowing lava fragments ejected by frequent explosions followed by small pyroclastic flows. During the day activity decreased but on 27 April at 0530 another phase of Strombolian activity began. A small pyroclastic flow occurred followed by a lava flow that descended to about 500-600 m above sea-level. This is presumably the cause of the 15-pixel alert on 28 April (figure 8). A third phase of Strombolian activity began at about 0600 on 29 April.

Low-frequency earthquakes continued throughout the month with an average of 60 per day. Some high-frequency earthquakes also occurred, but no volcanic tremors were recorded during March., 287213=RVO reported that volcanic activity was at low levels at Ulawun during 15 March to 1 April. Only white vapor was emitted from the main summit crater and there were no emissions from the north valley vent. The overall level of seismicity was low, with only small low-frequency volcanic earthquakes recorded. Electric tiltmeter measurements showed a long-term inflationary trend. According to the Darwin VAAC, on 12 and 13 April thin ash plumes from Ulawun were visible on satellite imagery at a height of ~700 m above the volcano. The plumes extended ~75 km E and NE., 222138=\"It is interesting to note that the high level of seismicity closely followed a heavy rainfall of 65 mm. It also occurred only three days after a major tectonic earthquake (ML 7.7) in the Solomon Sea, felt at MM V in the vicinity of Ulawun. It is possible that the earthquake opened microfissures in the volcanic edifice allowing ground water to penetrate and interact phreatically with shallow magma. The cyclic variations in seismicity since mid-January and increasing instability in March are believed to indicate that an eruption may occur in the near future.\", 232600=\"A brief but powerful eruption took place at Ulawun between 6 and 7 October. The visible commencement of the eruption was late at night on 6 October. At about 2300, faint glow was seen at the summit, intensifying at intervals of 1-2 minutes, presumably signifying weak ejections of incandescent lava fragments. At 0400 on the 7th the lava ejections were more frequent, occurring at intervals of 1 minute or less. No sounds of the eruption had been heard up until this time by observers at Ulamona Catholic Mission, and no significant ash emission had been observed., 344506=This report discusses Ulawun's ongoing mild seismicity, variably colored, though often white plumes, and other observations during May 2010 to late May 2011. The bulk of the reporting came from the Rabaul Volcano Observatory (RVO) with some information on plumes from the Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Center (VAAC) and others. Seismicity at Ulawun has generally been low since 2007, with occasional modest increases and steam emission (BGVN 33:03, 34:10, and 35:02)., 47515=The Rabaul Volcano Observatory (RVO) reported that activity at Ulawun remained quiet during February 2004. The main vent emitted white vapor at weak to moderate rates. No emissions were reported from the two north valley vents. No noise or night time glow was reported, and seismicity was at a low level. RVO reported in similar terms for the period 15 March-1 April, noting also that tiltmeter measurements recorded a long-term inflationary trend. According to Darwin VAAC, on 12 and 13 April thin ash plumes from Ulawun were visible on satellite imagery at a height of -~ 700 m above the volcano extending ~ 75 E and NE. On 14 April the ash plume rose ~ 3 km altitude and extended ~ 37 km NE. No HIGP-MODIS thermal alerts were recorded at Ulawun over the year to 11 May 2004., 318263=RVO reported that white-to-gray plumes rose from Ulawun during 23-25 June and fine ash fell on the SW and NW flanks. Low rumbling was heard and dull fluctuating incandescence was observed for a brief period of time from the SE. During 25-26 June white to gray-brown plumes rose 600 m.

On 17 May, emissions became briefly forceful and booming noises were reported. Light ashfall deposited between Ubili and Ulamona to the NW and Voluvolu to the NE, as well as on the NW and W flanks. Weak, fluctuating incandescence was observed on 22 May., 13476=Activity during May-July 2010. During 1-21 May, RVO reported variable amounts of white vapor; during late May to July, emissions were darker in color, with some specific examples highlighted below. Based on analyses of satellite imagery, the Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) reported ash plumes during 22-25 May that drifted 35-130 km at an altitude of 3 km. During late May through late June, RVO reported that white to gray plumes rose up to 1 km high and at times ashfall occurred. RVO noted gray plumes on 22, 25, and 29 May. People on the S part of New Britain observed fluctuating incandescence on 28-29 May., 125664=May seismic activity underwent a slight progressive decrease: Daily earthquake totals early in the month were in the range 400-600; by month's end they had dropped to 400. Since the end of April earthquake amplitudes also decreased., 17207=A check of MODVOLC thermal alerts in mid-April 2010 found no anomalies for Ulawun as far back as May 2001. Those 2001 alerts corresponded with new vents and large plumes in early 2001 (BGVN 26:05, 26:06).

On 21 February weak roaring noises were heard and weak incandescence was visible for a short time. After 22 February tremor returned to background levels. Seismic activity returned to background levels after volcanic tremor ceased on 18 March. Discrete low-frequency earthquakes continued to occur in small numbers. The electronic tiltmeter continued to show long-term deflation of the summit area. Based on recent observations, activity at Ulawun is expected to remain low., 75708=Volcanic tremor began at 2200 on 24 September. It peaked at about 1000 on 27 September and generally declined afterward. By 30 September seismic activity was at moderate levels. During 27-30 September a very slow deflationary trend was detected. Volcanic tremor continued to occur at moderate-to-high levels until it dropped dramatically on 11 October. After 11 October seismicity only consisted of discrete low-frequency earthquakes. On 8 and 9 October loud roaring noises emanated from the volcano., 339810=Several videos of Ulawun's plumes as posted on the web in 2010 showed them as white in color (Sabretoothed69, 2010).

Seismicity was moderate to low in February until power problems disabled the instrument. The number of seismic events that month fluctuated between 400 and 950 before declining to a range of 250-300 during 20-24 February. Low-frequency events dominated the record, although some high-frequency activity was recorded at a daily rate of 1-6 events., 148284=\"Activity at Ulawun has been at a low level since January 1990, producing small amounts of white vapour and few earthquakes. A temporary increase in seismicity was recorded between 11 and 20 February 1991. The peak was on 17 February when 295 medium-frequency volcanic earthquakes occurred.

This activity declined progressively 2-3 July to return to a rate of 1000-1500 B-type events per day. However, the average amplitude of discrete events remained fairly high (about 3 times normal levels) until 20 July. Further seismic crises on 16, 17, and 19 July marked the end of this particular period of stronger seismicity. No significant tilt changes were evident in July.\", 22136=RVO reported that increased seismic activity at Ulawun consisting of high-frequency volcano-tectonic (VT) earthquakes began on 7 June 2008. After peaking at 22 events on 12 June, the daily totals dropped and fluctuated between one and seven events per day, although totals of 14-15 events occurred on 14, 29, and 30 June. Some of the VT earthquakes were felt, including three on 30 June. Low-frequency earthquakes continued to occur as well, but remained within background levels; daily totals were between 257 and 775., 19347=A Rabaul Volcano Observatory (RVO) report noted steam plumes (figure 13) and increased seismicity at Ulawun during February 2010. Some of the mid-February plumes may have contained ash. As late as October 2009, Ulawun was generally quiet except for modest seismicity (BGVN 34:10)., 97978=By first light on 29 September people some distance away from Ulawun were able to see a thick vertical eruption column that rose ~12-15 km above the summit (figure 2). In relatively clear morning weather, the eruption column was visible from Rabaul, ~130 km NE of Ulawun. By this time ash clouds had blown WSW to NW. Roaring and rumbling noises ceased at about 1000 and resumed again at about 1300. At about this time also, there was a slight and brief change in wind direction resulting in the eruption's ash clouds being redirected to the N and NE., 144569=\"A buildup of seismicity observed toward the end of September continued through the first week of October, but the volcano remained in a non-erupting state, releasing vapour in small to moderate volumes. The increased seismicity consisted of periods of frequent discrete, low-frequency earthquakes. The maximum daily number of recorded events was ~350. Despite their increase in number, there was no marked increase in amplitude. This activity waned after a week and by the end of the month was at a low level, with earthquake counts of <30/day. High-frequency volcanic earthquakes were recorded occasionally throughout October.\", 64918=The long-term deformation trend based on measurements from an electronic tiltmeter is slow deflation of the summit area.

The third phase of Strombolian eruption began at about 0600 on the 29th. This phase was slower and more gradual, peaking at about 1800-2000 on the 29th., 103845=The Rabaul Volcano Observatory put Ulawun at stage two alert. Heavy ash fall from the eruption prompted government officials to evacuate 3,750 residents of areas near the volcano including Ubili town, Noau town, Voluvolu villages, and Navo plantations. As of 5 October activity had declined and was relatively stable, but the evacuation orders were still in effect. Several news articles have linked the volcanism at Ulawun to the increased level of activity at Rabaul which is ~150 km to the NE of Ulawun, but according to a Post Courier article the East New Britain Provincial Disaster Committee stated that there was no correlation between the volcanoes' activity., 331954=RVO reported that activity at Ulawun was low during 4-31 August; emissions from the summit crater consisted of white vapor until 16 August, and were gray during 17-31 August.

Light ashfall was reported in areas between Ubili in the NW and Voluvolu in the NE., 117890=Activity throughout April-June continued at a low level. During April and May, emissions consisted of weak to strong white vapor, with occasional gray emissions during May. Ulawun released mostly weak to moderate white vapor, occasionally high in volume during June. On 2 June low volumes of blue vapor accompanied the white vapor.

Another ash plume was seen reaching ~75 km WNW of the summit on satellite imagery on 10 October at an altitude around 3 km., 89276=The Darwin VAAC received a pilot report that a \"smoke\" cloud had been emitted from Ulawun on 30 April at 0730. The Rabaul Volcano Observatory (RVO) confirmed the report. The cloud reached an altitude of ~9 km and drifted NW and SW, expanding to 80-113 km in radius. GMS and NOAA weather satellite imagery indicated that the cloud may have reached a maximum height of ~13.7 km and that the eruption ceased by approximately 1530. By 3 May volcanic activity had decreased, but, because further ash emissions could occur, RVO placed the volcano at Stage 2 Alert. RVO reported that limited evacuations occurred.
