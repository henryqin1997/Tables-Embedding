Michigan State appears to perform as-expected @ -2.5%, but they have the highest standard deviation.\u00a0 Sparty wins a lot of games they have no right to win, and loses a lot of games for no reason, and basically acts very Sparty-like The third most underrated teams is Iowa.\u00a0 Given Michigan's overrated-ness, this does not bode well for this Saturday.\u00a0 Or it has no relevance, since Iowa is already favored ... I haven't decided. Purdue has only upset 6 teams in the past decade.\u00a0 Northwestern performed the same feat\u00a0between 2005 and 2006. I\u00a0expected the ratio of underrated teams to overrated teams to be closer.\u00a0 The Big Ten,\u00a0not surprisingly, is not performing.",
