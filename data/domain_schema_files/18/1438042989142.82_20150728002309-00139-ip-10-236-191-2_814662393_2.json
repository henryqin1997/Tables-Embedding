Please help us to test this number range from foreign carriers, and add your test results to the table below. The list has been moved to an extra page, as it was just too long. :-D Assigned Numbers (currently 80.291 numbers) A second translation is performed by the Service Producer to get a Terminating Number (TN) to address the called party. On receipt of an ETNS call, the Serving Network triggers the ETNS translation database to translate the incoming European Number (EN) into an outgoing Routeing Number (RN). The Routeing Number points to the Service Network to which the Service Producer is connected. The calling party dials the European Number (EN) in its international format. Based on the ESI, the call is routed to the Serving Network. Note: A network is called a Serving Network when it is able to analyse and translate the European Number by using ETNS translation capabilities. The Assisted Network has only to analyse the ESI to route the call to the appropriate Serving Network.",
