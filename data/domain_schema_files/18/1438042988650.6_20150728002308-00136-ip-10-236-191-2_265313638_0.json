Lowery Blvd., NW Atlanta, GA 30318\u00a0Phone: (404) 892-9822\u00a0 Privacy Policy | Terms Atlanta Community Food Bank is a 501(c)(3) private nonprofit organization., 51350=May 10, 2015 by Cicely, 35178=May 29, 2015 by Amy, 31055=Waide has served for three years as Atlanta Community Food Bank\u2019s Vice President of Partner Operations, leading the organization to record-breaking years of food distribution to the community. He follows Founder and Executive Director Bill Bolling, who announced in 2014 that he would step down from his position, following 36 years of leadership., 47427=When I first began the Atlanta Community Food Bank in 1979, people often said to me, \u201cI hope you can work yourself out of a job.\u201d And I guess in the beginning that was my simple goal \u2013 no more hunger in a land of plenty. It seemed like a reasonable goal at the time since 30 percent of what we grew and packaged was unmarketable, often being sent to the landfill. Maybe all we needed, I thought, was a better logistics system., 67328=March 27, 2015 by Rachel, 51698=My journey with the SNAP Challenge 2015 is over, but yours can begin May 10-17, 2015. Thank you in advance for highlighting this important issue to ensure all Georgians have access to good, wholesome and locally-grown food. As you embark upon your journey, I leave you with these tips and words of wisdom:, 56006=May 8, 2015 by ACFB, 60860=May 7, 2015 by Cicely, 47081=May 13, 2015 by Bill, 43172=May 15, 2015 by ACFB, 61207=On Sunday, May 3, I embarked upon my second SNAP Challenge. I am attempting to live and eat on the average budget of a SNAP (formerly known as Food Stamps) recipient. The average daily allowance for a SNAP recipient in GA is $4.17 a day., 30465=June 10, 2015 by ACFB, 43518=When my mother, Jennie Tate Anderson, died in 1985, I was brokenhearted. I decided to do something for someone else in her honor. That summer, I began volunteering at the Atlanta Community Food Bank, sorting bread at first, then checking agency orders by hand., 39322=Did you know that May 25th is National Brown-Bag-It day? If not, I\u2019m betting you\u2019re not alone. National Brown-Bag-It Day is a simple observance reminding us that there is a more affordable and nutritious option than fast food to enjoy at lunchtime. It is also an occasion to celebrate and challenge our creativity and thriftiness! In my opinion, packing lunches has become a lost art. On a regular basis, I watch as friends and colleagues spend ten dollars or more on mid-day restaurant meals that are less nutritious than what could be brought from home., 63222=May 4, 2015 by ACFB, 38976=May 21, 2015 by ACFB}",
