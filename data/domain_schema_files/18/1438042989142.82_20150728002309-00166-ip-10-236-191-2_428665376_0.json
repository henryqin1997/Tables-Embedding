    "textAfterTable": "After an improbable day of college football, Ohio State finds itself No. 2 in the latest Coaches Poll and possibly just one win away from playing for the national championship. The Buckeyes locked up four first-place votes and have 1,462 points in the poll, good enough for a 25-point lead over No. 3 Auburn. Ohio State received 42 second-place votes, while the Tigers were voted second on 16 ballots. Three voters ranked the Buckeyes fifth and one even had them No. 6. Auburn, however was voted fourth or higher on every coach's ballot. Michigan State moved up from No. 11 to No. 9 in the poll, which will help Ohio State's argument\u00a0\u2013 if the Buckeyes can take care of business in the Big Ten Championship Game. Wisconsin, losers at home to Penn State Saturday, fell from No. 14 to No. 21. Ohio State-Michigan and Auburn-Alabama are the two greatest rivalries in college football and both series saw perhaps their finest game on Saturday. The Buckeyes intercepted a two-point conversion with 32 seconds left that would have won the game for the Wolverines, while the Tigers scored twice in the final 32 seconds, including a 109-yard missed field goal return on the final play, to beat the two-time defending-champion Crimson Tide. It sets up another intriguing Championship Saturday this week. The cities of Indianapolis (Ohio State-Michigan State), Charlotte (Florida State-Duke) and Atlanta (Auburn-Missouri) will host games that will likely determine who plays in the BCS National Championship Game on",
