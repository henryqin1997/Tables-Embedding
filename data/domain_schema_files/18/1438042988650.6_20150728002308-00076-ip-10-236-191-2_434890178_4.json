But I understand that the 2014 power units are too complex, but I hope the FIA will gradually start simplifying things, such that the driver will need to make crucial decision on their own. I feel like the element of observing a problem and solving it is completely dead nowadays and it would be great if drivers would manage for instance their fuel on their own., 163892=BogRacer said on 11th February 2014, 18:16, 171630=Chad (@chaddy) said on 12th February 2014, 0:11, 158984=mark p said on 11th February 2014, 17:21, 126594=petebaldwin (@petebaldwin) said on 11th February 2014, 16:11, 124801=Marciare_o_Marcire (@marciare-o-marcire) said on 13th February 2014, 12:45, 149889=Marciare_o_Marcire (@marciare-o-marcire) said on 13th February 2014, 12:52, 73591=They used to have pretty displays like this pre the mclaren standard ECU.

    "textBeforeTable": "In 2013: With over two dozen dials, switches and buttons on their steering wheels it\u2019s a lot to expect Formula One drivers to keep their cars in the perfect state at all times while also driving it flat-out and jockeying for position. Teams were once able to adjust the cars directly from the pits but those days are long gone, meaning if a setting needs to be changed they have to tell the driver to do it. Car advice Here\u2019s a look at what were the dominant themes in last year\u2019s team radio communications and what we can expect will change in the year ahead. Team radio messages give us the best insight into how drivers and teams approach the races and we can expect to hear plenty about the new technology once the season begins in Melbourne. Life in the cockpit of a Formula One car is going to get even more hectic this year as Formula One\u2019s engine revolution puts teams and drivers under greater strain. 69 comments Keith Collantine February 11, 2014 at 12:00 pm by F1 technology The team radio messages we can expect in 2014",

In 2014: Drivers are going to have even more to keep on top of this year as their power units have become far more sophisticated. Teams have incorporated display screens into their steering wheels to help their drivers keep on top of energy recovery systems that are more powerful and more complex. Fuel management In 2013: F1 teams have always been wary of finishing a race with too much fuel in the car, wasting valuable performance on unnecessary weight. The flip-side of that is sometimes they find they are running short and have to tell their drivers to back off. Race Lap From To Message Canada 23 Mark Slade Kimi Raikkonen Mix one, Kimi.
