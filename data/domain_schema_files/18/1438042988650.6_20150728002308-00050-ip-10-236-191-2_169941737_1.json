Nice list of movies to watch. http://nirnajanactor.blogspot.in/2013/11/s-niranjan-actor-fraud.html, 49457=@MinaiMinai Thank you for the tip on Kannadastore--they were previously out of stock on Mithileya Seetheyaru, but your comment got me to email them, and they have M.S. and Janani available! Two more located! @kiran, thanks for stopping by! My average is 6-8 films a month, at that rate, I should be through the 47 (of the 73) films that I have by the end of 2012. Prakash Raj hasn't been in any films in the last few months, but he has more films coming out this year. I figure I will be caught up by February or March of 2013.}",

And my monthly searching for titles turned up Subhash on youtube, so I have hope that more titles will appear in random ways. UPDATE 6/22/12:\u00a0 Thanks! If you are able to help me track down any of these films, I will happily pay the costs of acquisition and shipping. Any format--dvd, vcd, vhs, file--is fine. You will have my eternal gratitude, plus I\u2019ll happily return the favor of tracking down mysterious items for you.\u00a0Please feel free to post any leads or suggestions in the comments, or email me at dustdevil dot liz at gmail dot com. (For some of the films, I have found songs and short clips. These are definitely helpful, but my ultimate goal is to find the full movie.) the illegal trade in Soundarya-Jagapati Babu films of the early 2000's available in the usual places, but in a different language version (Hindi dub of Telugu, Telugu dub of Kannada, etc.) in a mysterious corner of the internet (youtube, dailymotion, etc), discovered by someone with superior google-skills on television, in the middle of the night in the bargain bin at a local dvd shop I\u2019m posting this in the hope that more eyes looking for these films will yield results.\u00a0 I\u2019ll update and post this",
