I can't remember the name of the gentleman that I spoke to last night when ordering this service. But he was all of the above. He was very patient and took his time explaining everything to me. The do's and don'ts and he was very clear with his instructions, terms of the contract, cancellation policy, etc. He left not stone unturned. He was very friendly and very professional. He knew this product very well and was able to answer all questions asked. I normally don't fill these out but if you could pass on this information to the gentleman that sold me this service, please tell him thank you! He is very fanatical in his work and his exuberance and passion for both the customer and DirecTV showed through the phone. I would recommend others as well as long as he is",
