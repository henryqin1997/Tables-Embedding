The Southern Daily Echo reported this (Thursday) morning that the 25 year old was 'due to link up with Bournemouth today.' The defender who can play at centre back or full back has seen his opportunities at St Fairies limited since their back to back promotions from League One to the Premier League and following a nightclub attack in 2011 which left him seriously injured. He made just four Championship appearances last season and has only been involved in Southampton's League Cup campaign this season. He joined Championship side Charlton in November on loan making seven appearances (all starts) and according to Sky Sports 'Bournemouth have moved quickly to lure Seaborne to Dean Court ahead of several Championship clubs.' The deal was completed this afternoon with Seaborne available to go straight into the squad for Saturday's trip to Walsall.
