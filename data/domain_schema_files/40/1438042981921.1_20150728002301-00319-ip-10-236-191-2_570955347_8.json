These data can be obtained free of charge at www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/conts/retrieving.html (or from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC), 12 Union Road, Cambridge CB2 1EZ, UK; Fax: +44(0)1222-336033; E-Mail: deposit@ccdc.cam.ac.uk)., 66268=Initial molecular geometry of the title compound was taken from its crystal structure. Then, DFT calculations at B3LYP/6-311G** levelof theory by the Berny method [33] were performed with the Gaussian 03 software package [34]. Vibrational frequencies calculated ascertain the structure was stable (no imaginary frequencies). Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analyses were also performed on the optimized structure. On the basis of the MNDO Hamiltonian [35] and PM3 parametrization [36] with the MOPAC [37] program package, the molecular hyperpolarizability value was also calculated. All calculations were performed on a DELL PE 2850 server and a Pentium IV computer using the default convergence criteria., 74227=This work was supported by Fund of Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Chemistry of Low-Dimensional Materials (JSKC12107 and JSKC12106) and Huaian Science & Technology Bureau, Jiangsu Province, China (HAG2012005, HAG2013009 and HC201307)., 64277=The selected crystal of the title compound was mounted on an Rigaku raxis Rapid IP Area Detector diffractometer. Reflection data were measured at 293(2) K using graphite monochromated Mo-K\u03b1 (\u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5) radiation and a \u03c9scan mode. The correction for Lp factors and empirical absorption were applied to the data. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares method on Fobs2 using the SHELXTL software package [31]. All non-H atoms were anisotropically refined. The hydrogen atom positions were fixed geometrically at calculated distances and allowed to ride on the parent C atoms. The final least-square cycle gave R = 0.0707, wR2 = 0.1922. Atomic scattering factors and anomalous dispersion corrections were taken from International Table for X-ray Crystallography [32]. A summary of the key crystallographic information is given in Table 4., 21999=Pyrazoline derivatives are five-membered, nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds with high hole-transport efficiency, excellent blue emission and high quantum yield [1,2,3], which have made them useful as fluorescent brightening agents, fluorescence chemosensors, hole-transport materials in electrophotography, OLED and as fluorescent materials [4,5,6,7,8]. Since 2001, different groups have prepared pyrazoline nanoparticles ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers in size by using the re-precipitation method and explored their size-tunable optical properties for application in optoelectronic devices [9,10,11]. Our group has also reported the synthesis, structure and spectra properties of a series of 2-pyrazolines by experimental and theoretical methods [12,13,14,15,16,17,18]., 105266=\u00a9 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.
