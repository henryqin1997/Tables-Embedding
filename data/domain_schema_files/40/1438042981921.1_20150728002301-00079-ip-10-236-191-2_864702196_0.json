The following table shows the results on a T3E for 52-68 processors. Open problem: Based on different prime decompositions for successive numbers of processors, the beff algorithm cannot guarantee that the effective bandwidth is monotonous with the number of processors, see \"Table of the first results with version 3.1\" below. To reduce the problem with prime numbers, the topology selection should be modified according to the following algorithm: If the number of nodes is larger than 8 then the size of the each topology is reduced until each dimension is larger than 1. If the number of nodes is larger than 4 then the size for the 2- and 3-dimensional topology is reduced to the next even number. If the dimension of a direction is 1 then this direction is omitted. Patterns without directions longer than 1 are omitted. If the dimension of a direction is 1 then this direction is omitted. Patterns without directions longer than 1 are omitted. 3-dimensional x-direction and y-direction and z-direction 3-dimensional z-direction 3-dimensional y-direction 3-dimensional x-direction 2-dimensional x-direction and y-direction 2-dimensional y-direction 2-dimensional x-direction 1-dimensional x-direction The bi-section communication pattern sends a message only on each second process.
