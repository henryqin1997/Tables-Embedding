He turned in the fifth-fastest lap of the opening session, and although he hasn't won at Daytona since 2004, his 12.9 average finish in the last 20 races at the track is the best in the series. Not to mention the fact that he has finished fourth or better four times since 2010, picking up three second-place finishes during the stretch., 2613=One driver might be able to help fantasy owners achieve the goal is Matt Kenseth. He posted the 11th-fastest lap in the first practice to go along with the third-best 10-lap average speed. Perhaps more importantly, Kenseth has been the best driver in the series at plate tracks dating back to the start of 2012. He leads all drivers in points scored, wins, top-five finishes and top-10s while leading 363 more laps during the stretch than any other driver., 4974=Fantasy owners looking for some sleeper options may want to consider A.J. Allmendinger or Paul Menard. Driving the Phoenix Racing No. 51 machine, Allmendinger turned in the fastest lap of the first practice session and the best 10-lap average speed. He has also finished 11th or better in two of his last three starts at Daytona, and the No. 51 car has finished in the top 10 in both of the plate races in 2013. For his part, Menard put down the sixth-fastest lap of the opening practice, and in his last five starts at Daytona, he has four top-15 finishes.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Happy Hour Speeds (sorted by Best Lap) For those in deeper leagues or in survival-type leagues where a different driver has to be used every week, Danica Patrick may be worth a look. She recorded one of the 10 fastest laps of the first practice, and she also had one the 10 best 10-lap average speeds. Don't forget, she did start on the pole and finish eighth in the Daytona 500 to open the year. If she is going to manage another top-10 finish this season, Daytona is one of the likeliest spots.

Another driver who didn't disappoint in practice was Clint Bowyer, and despite being winless at Daytona, he hasn't done much disappointing in general at the track. His 15.5 average finish at Daytona is the fourth best among active drivers, and in 15 starts, Bowyer has finished outside the top 20 in",
