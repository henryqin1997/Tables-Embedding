The frame seems to climb better with less bobbing than the already great Tallboy I had before - combination of the CTD shock and the updated frame design. The XX1 drive-train is great and the XTR brakes are reported to be the best in breed, and were way better than the SRAM XX brakes I had in 2012 (magnesium ones). Expensive, but dream bike spec. Love it, and selling my hardtail as a result.}",
