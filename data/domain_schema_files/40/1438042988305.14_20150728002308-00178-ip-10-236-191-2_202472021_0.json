This season, they bring back a team that, on paper, looks again to be ready to compete. What do they need to get the job done this time around? Rally Caps Offseason Outlook - Cincinnati Reds Saturday, December 1, 2012",
    "textAfterTable": "The Reds don't really have a lot of holes to fill as they enter the 2013 season. That's not to say the team listed above is the one that will be listed on the Opening Day roster. There are definitely moves to be made as the team lacks a true leadoff hitter and could really use some work on the bench. The catching situation is fine. Ryan Hanigan is entering the last season of his contract so we will probably see Devin Mesoraco ease more into the starting role. Last season, Hanigan started in 98 games while Mesoraco started 48. I see that split getting closer this season with the possibility of being completely flipped. Hanigan still puts up good enough numbers to be considered a fringe starter, so I don't see him being interested in a timeshare with the Reds in 2014. Mesoraco didn't show much ability at the plate last season, but did show more pop than the incumbent. With more playing time, he could get more comfortable at the plate. The Reds infield is completely locked up. Joey Votto and Brandon Phillips signed extensions that will keep them in Cincinnati for quite a while. The team also trusted Zack Cosart enough to make 131 starts last season, so will obviously be willing to give him the reins again this season. The team lost Scott Rolen to free agency and possible retirement, but Todd Frazier",
