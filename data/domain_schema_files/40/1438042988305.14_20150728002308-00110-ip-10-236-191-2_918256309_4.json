So effervescing was Walkden\u2019s attack on railway finance that the Daily Herald flared into huge headlines: \u201cRAILWAY FINANCE RIDDLED; POVERTY PLEA THAT IS UNJUSTIFIED\u201d; he argued that the increased dividends on Ordinary Stock (3.95 per cent., 1920; 3.99 per cent., 1921; 4.83 per cent., 1922; 5.25 per cent., 1923; 5.20 per cent., 1924).were \u201can unfair tax\u201d of an extra three to four million pounds a year on the workers and that it \u201cwas not quite fair to ask the workers to maintain it.\u201d At a later stage he went even further: \u201cWe suggest,\u201d he said, \u201cthat with the companies\u2019 very strong financial position the companies are not really justified in coming here and asking that raids should be made on the cupboards of the railway workers.\u201d, 14092=The economies achieved in 1927 (despite a heavy mileage increase for 1927 over 1925) are largely due to economies in labour as is evidenced by the following:-, 15217=Accepting 1925 as the period of prosperity which Thomas, Bromley and Walkden contended that it was; and in view of the fact that 1927 gives figures of increased receipts and decreased expenditure against 1925, the tentative figures of decreased expenditure and receipts for the forty weeks of 1928 (January to October) do not negative the prosperity of railway companies to a degree which should enable even Thomas \u201cto raid the workers\u2019 food cupboards\u201d in the interests of the shareholders. The figures of receipts on railway working do not justify the clamour of \u201ctemporary crisis,\u201d and render farcical the demand for \u201ctemporary sacrifice of workers\u2019 wages.\u201d, 10276=Walkden was a valiant \u201cLeftist\u201d in 1925 (it was a militant period!), but the General Strike of 1926, with its glimpse of civil war, has terrified the \u201cmilitancy\u201d out of such pseudo-Leftists as Bromley and Walkden. July, 1928, finds J. H. Thomas in the reformist saddle, and he is able to greet the rail companies\u2019 wage-cut demand with cynical humbug about \u201cPeace in Industry,\u201d and to announce the \u00a33,000,000 wage-surrender with characteristically insolent nonsense about \u201cA lesson to the world,\u201d \u201cI am content to be denounced, but I say that we have not only got the co-operation of the directors, but we have contributed something to make hundreds of homes happier... The settlement is the best ever made.\u201d, 13808=These figures suggest a considerable measure of prosperity; the rise in gross receipts from 1923 is important, and the big drop in expenditure from 1925 - a large measure of which is due to economies in labour - undermines the case for a temporary crisis in railway finance., 9=Stewart Purkiss 1928, 21410=These figures serve to remind us that while 1927 receipts on rail working showed an increase on 1925, it is very important to remember in considering the total railway income that in 1925 \u02656,892,888 and in 1926 \u00a317,199,139 were \u201cadded to net income by transfer from reserve funds and profit on the realisation of investments,\u201d and that this has had a most serious effect on the reserve and depreciation funds. These reserve figures are so variously presented that it is necessary to use them with great care, but a fair comparison indicates that the class of reserves which in 1925 was \u00a3103,341,313, in 1926 was \u00a386,430,675 and in 1927 was down to \u00a378,600,943., 124=Source: The Labour Monthly, Volume 10, November 1928, pp. 653-662 (3,266 words) Transcription: Ted Crawford HTML Markup: Mark Harris, 14996=This combination of figures shows a most desirable state of affairs from the point of view of the railway companies; a smaller number of railway workers carrying on a greater amount of work in 1927 than in 1925., 8221=In June, 1928, the rail unions\u2019 leaders discovered a \u201ccrisis.\u201d So grave was its character that even the poorest paid railway worker was appealed to to make a wage sacrifice to save \u201cour\u201d railways. But only the simplest soul would be certain of \u201ccrisis\u201d on evidence from such a source; those who have seen Frank Hodges, Spencer, Adamson and Herbert Smith follow Havelock Wilson along the path of \u201cindustrial peace\u201d realise that many of those who have not yet fully declared themselves have taken Havelock Wilson as their guide. So the pleas of Bromley, Walkden and Thomas are not in themselves sufficient evidence of a temporary crisis in the railway industry.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "The following table, adapted from one given in the Monthly Circular of the Labour Research Department, shows the important part which reserves and the interest on reserves has been playing in railway finances; a comparison between the \u201cNet Receipts on Railway Working\u201d and \u201cNet Railway Receipts\u201d in the table below will help to keep to the fore the extent to which the railway income, other than receipts on railway workings, has been employed to ensure the railway shareholders\u2019 dividends. One or two factors largely explain the pessimism which the Stock Exchange figures reveal. The table of figures given above indicate the net receipts on railway working of the four groups, but they are not the figures of the net receipts of the railway groups from all sources. (The net receipts will include, of course, the income on reserves, &c.) Reserves, Road Transport and Collapsing Industry So, despite the passing into law of the Railways Road Powers Bill, despite the indirect aid to railways through the new rating proposals, despite the \u201cco-operation\u201d of the railway workers by the 2\u00bd per cent. cut, despite the active propaganda on behalf of railway shares in the finance columns of the daily Press (\u201cStock can be bought to yield 9 per cent.\u201d; \u201cSouthern Preferred yields 7 per cent.\u201d; \u201cL.N.E. can be bought to yield 9 per cent.\u201d; \u201cSuch rates will not be obtainable for long\u201d; \u201cAt the present level home railway stocks yield better opportunities for investors than many industrials\u201d); despite all these factors railway",

So, while it is true that there stands in reserves a sum which renders farcical the panic of J. H. Thomas and renders criminal the recommendation of the 2\u00bd per cent. cut as a measure against immediate temporary collapse, it is also true that these figures evidence the fact that reserves have played a great part in the \u201cprosperity\u201d of British railways in the past seven years, and the added fact that the past distribution of reserves to go to pay the dividends on \u201cOrdinary\u201d and other stocks has largely destroyed the possibility of reserves being employed to save the railway position during the decline which faces them. In taking the long view of the future of British railways the question of reserves is of real importance. Road transport is a feature of railway decline which",
