Ruby certainly meets this criterion \u2014 to a greater degree than most languages I've learned over three decades, I find Ruby requires minimum time spent poring over instructions, and maximum time spent producing useful, readable code. I think history will judge Ruby kindly, and possibly even identify it as the first computer language that is kind to its users. Before going on, I ask that my readers check for the presence of Ruby on their systems, and if necessary acquire Ruby from the first of the reference links provided at the bottom of this page.
