You'll have to ask demerphq about anything which resembles math... I'm okay till about 10, then my shoes come off. The account of level powers isn't complete, and there will be further changes to the powers anyway. The site docs will be updated accordingly. Now that it's done, I find, somewhat to my surprise, that I'm excited. Last week I had no idea how many XP I had... now I find I'm only 566 points short of Vicar. I think a lot of people will feel the same. It's all still a game, but if you play it right, it's a game of learning, and helping others. That makes it a game worth playing. None of the changes make it more likely that everyone will play fair... but experience shows that the great majority in this community are in it for the right reasons, and that's not likely to change either. I, on the other hand, take full responsibility for the decision itself. If you don't like it, I'm to blame. In my defense, I shall only say that while I cannot hope to please everyone, I do entertain the hope that this will please many, and that the rest will not be too deeply offended. The role demerphq has played in bringing about this little miracle cannot be overstated.",
