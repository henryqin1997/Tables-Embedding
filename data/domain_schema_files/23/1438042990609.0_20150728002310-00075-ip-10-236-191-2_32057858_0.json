While starting left tackle Kelvin Beachum was able to practice fully for the first time on Friday and is listed as probable coming off a knee injury, starting right tackle Marcus Gilbert is questionable with an ankle injury. One of their primary backups at offensive tackle is also questionable in former first-round pick Michael Adams. He was added to the team\u2019s injury report on Friday with a rib injury. The Pittsburgh Steelers are team that has endured injuries on par with that of the Bills this season. On Sunday they may be shorthanded at offensive tackle.
