However, as of January 31, 2014, those statistics have reversed, though not dramatically enough to be called an improvement. Some communities in the area have been affected disproportionately, with 48% of the afflicted being in black communities.[36] In Broward County, sexual education in public schools is not mandatory and the curriculum that is employed sporadically has not been updated in ten years or more, according to school officials. In 2013, the Broward County School Board held a vote to require schools to teach sex-ed at least once a year for every grade, a program slated to begin in the 2014-2015 school year if passed.[37], 31419=As of the 2013 Census Estimate,[15] the 2013 population estimate is 1,838,844 which is a 5.2% increase since the 2010 Census., 7552=Broward County is a county located in the U.S. state of Florida. As of 2010, the population was 1,748,066,[1] making it the second-most populous county in Florida and the 18th-most populous in the United States. Its county seat is Fort Lauderdale.[2], 64718=Municipality populations are based on the 2010 Census.[31], 26035=As of the census of 2000, there were 1,623,018 people, 654,445 households, and 411,645 families residing in the county. The population density was 1,346 people per square mile (520/km\u00b2). There were 741,043 housing units at an average density of 615 per square\u00a0mile (237/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the county was 70.57% White (58% were Non-Hispanic),[11] 20.54% Black or African American, 0.24% Native American, 2.25% Asian, 0.06% Pacific Islander, 3.00% from other races, and 3.35% from two or more races. 16.74% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race., 28581=Broward is the only county in the nation outside the Northeast in which Italian-Americans formed the largest ethnic group in 2000. They are concentrated mainly in the Pompano Beach area., 15341=Broward County was founded in 1915. It was named for Napoleon Bonaparte Broward, Governor of Florida from 1905 to 1909. It was originally intended to be named Everglades County, but then-Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives Ion Farris amended the bill that established the county to be named after Broward.[3] In 1915, Palm Beach County and Dade County contributed nearly equal portions of land to create Broward County. At its inception Broward County was considered a leader in agricultural products and services within the State of Florida, but the massive post-World War II buildup of South Florida transformed the region. It was one of the counties at the center of the 2000 U.S. Presidential election recount controversy., 37326=According to the most recent estimates from the U.S. Census of 2013, the total population of Broward County had risen to almost 1.85 million people (1,838,844), and increased by 5.2% between April 1, 2010 and July 1, 2013. This number is accounted for by an increase to 90,778 (5.2%) in its Hispanic population., 35579=As of 2010, 32% of Broward residents were foreign born (including naturalized American citizens.) Haitians made up the largest population of immigrants, with Jamaicans coming in second, Colombians in third, followed by Cuban exiled refugees in fourth place, then Peruvians, Venezuelans, Brazilians, Dominicans, Canadians, and Mexicans being the tenth highest group of expatriates.[18], 33971=U.S. Census Bureau 2013 Ethnic/Race Demographics:[17], 31065=According to the Census,[14] Broward County is the 9th largest county with same sex households. As of the 2010 Census, there were 9,125 same sex households out of a total of 686,047 households (1.33%)., 31978=As of 2010, 63.44% of all residents spoke English as their first language, while 22.22% spoke Spanish, 5.42% French Creole, 1.48% Portuguese, 1.41% French, and 0.59% of the population spoke Italian as their mother language. In total, 36.56% of the population spoke languages other than English as their primary language.[16] Since many immigrants are coming from the Anglophone Caribbean, where English is spoken, the change is not as fast as the rate of immigration would suggest.[citation needed], 30366=As of 2005, Broward County led the nation's metropolitan areas in new AIDS diagnoses, with a reported rate 58.4 new AIDS diagnoses per 100,000 people. County officials think the numbers may stem from a new and successful HIV testing campaign that has resulted in many people being diagnosed with AIDS at the same time they've been diagnosed with HIV.[13] Ironically, without the implementation of the new testing campaign, the reported numbers of new diagnoses would have probably been lower., 47875=Over the past fifty years, Broward County has gone from solidly Republican to solidly Democratic. In the 1972 U.S. presidential election, Broward County residents voted overwhelmingly for Richard Nixon over George McGovern. From the 1992 U.S. presidential election onward, however, voters of Broward County backed the Democratic presidential nominee over the Republican nominee by strong majorities. Broward County is now the most reliably Democratic county in the state,[26][27] with the exception of the much less populous Gadsden County. This change in voting tendencies may likely be the result of a continuous flow from large migrations of snowbirds and transplanted people from the historically more liberal Northeastern states and other blue states, as well as a growing LGBT community, and also naturalized U.S. citizens born in places such as Latin America, the Caribbean, Canada, Europe, and Asia.}",
