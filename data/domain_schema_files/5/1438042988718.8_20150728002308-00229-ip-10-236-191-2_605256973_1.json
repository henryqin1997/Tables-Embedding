The three finalists for collegiate track & field\u2019s top award in 2010 were seniors, and, over the next several months, three different names will come to the forefront, showing themselves as the nation\u2019s elite.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{9773=Williams made quite a mark during the 2010 indoor season in the triple jump. At the NCAA Championships, Williams won her second-consecutive title in the event and could become only the second (Yvette Bates, USC, 1986-88) to win a third with a national crown this March. In winning the ACC indoor crown for a third time, her best leap of 46-8\u00bc (14.24m) placed her just two centimeters shy of the collegiate record of 46-9 (14.25m). Overall, Williams has won eight ACC crowns and four NCAA titles, which included triple jump indoor-outdoor sweeps in 2009 and a long jump-triple jump outdoor sweep in the same year., 9072=Theisen won the NCAA heptathlon title for second-straight time in 2010, topping the field by over 400 points for a personal-best and school-record score of 6,094. In addition to also winning the NCAA pentathlon crown indoors, Theisen would lead off the Oregon 4\u00d7400-meter squad to a NCAA title last year. Theisen\u2019s all-time best pentathlon score of 4,396, set in 2010, sits as the fourth best among collegians all-time. Theisen has twice won the Pac-10 heptathlon crown, and, in 2009, Theisen was 15th in the same event at the IAAF World Championships., 10412=The Bowerman Advisory Board appointed four of its members to comprise The Bowerman Women\u2019s Watch Committee and another four of its members to make up The Bowerman Men\u2019s Watch Committee. The committee will release their next women\u2019s update on Thursday, February 11. The three men and three women finalists will be named late June., 5285=In 2010, Hackett won five NCAA Division II titles, set three championship records, and added an all-time Division II best in the 200 with Lincoln University of Missouri. It was quite a year for the Caribbean native. And, with a move to Division I with the transfer to LSU, the stage lights are now a little brighter. At the NCAA DII outdoor meet, Hackett took titles in the 100, 200, and 4\u00d7100, all for the second-straight year. In the 200, she ran a championships-meet record and an all-time division best 22.75 in the final to break a 17-year-old standard. The time also stood as the third-best among all collegians in 2010, trailing only 2009 Bowerman finalist Porscha Lucas and current watchlister Jeneba Tarmoh., 2934=Atkins was the 2009 NCAA outdoor champion in the 400-meter dash where she ran a personal best 50.39, a time that stood as a top-12 time in the world for the year. In the 2010 season, Atkins finished fourth indoors and third outdoors in respective NCAA Championships at 400 meters, was SEC outdoor champion in the event, and also scored in the NCAA outdoor meet with Auburn\u2019s 4\u00d7100 and 4\u00d7400 relay squads., 6137=Kaufman became Hawai\u2019i\u2019s first national track & field champion in 26 years in winning the high jump at the 2010 NCAA Outdoor Championships in Eugene. Kaufman was the only to clear 6-1\u00bc (1.86m) at the national meet to clinch the title. Kaufman was second at the NCAA indoor meet and cleared a season-best 6-3\u00bc (1.91m) once in each indoor and outdoor seasons. Kaufman\u2019s all-time best is a 6-4 (1.93m) clearance claimed in winning the WAC title in 2009., 23997=\u00a9 2015 NCAA | Turner Sports Interactive, Inc., 3483=Beard, who mainly specializes in the 200 and 400 meters, helped the Aggies to a second-straight NCAA team title outdoors in scoring second-place national finishes in the 400 as anchor of the squad\u2019s 4\u00d7400. Beard accumulated four Big 12 titles in 2010 and an all-time collegiate best as a member of the Aggie 4\u00d7200 that clocked 1:29.42 at the Penn Relays. Beard\u2019s star has shined the brightest on the international stage as she lays claim to four world-championship medals. Most notably, Beard was the third leg of Team USA\u2019s 4\u00d7400-meter relay squad that won gold at the 2009 IAAF World Championships in Berlin. Beard has also been on two gold-medaling IAAF World Junior Championship 4\u00d7400 teams to go with a silver medal won individually in the 400 in 2008., 8217=Tarmoh is another of a number of talented sprinters to watch in 2011. Tarmoh was a top-three finisher at the NCAA indoor meet at 60 meters and at the NCAA outdoor meet in the 100 and 200 in 2010. In addition, Tarmoh led off the NCAA champ Aggie 4\u00d7100 squad most of the season in 2010 and was a member of the 4\u00d7200 team that set a new collegiate record at the Penn Relays. In addition, Tarmoh swept 100 and 200 titles at the Big 12 Outdoor Championships in May, was a USATF finalist in the 100 in June, and won the NACAC 100-meter title in July. Tarmoh is a three-time international medalist which includes a 100-meter gold earned at the IAAF World Junior Championships in 2008., 6747=Mayo is a multi-dimensional athlete, having claimed conference titles and national acclaim in both the short sprints and high hurdles. Last year, Mayo swept Big 12 indoor titles in the 60 dash and 60 hurdles for the second straight year and finished second and fifth, respectively, in those events at the NCAA meet. Outdoors, Mayo was an NCAA qualifier in the 100, 100 hurdles, and in 4\u00d7100. However, upon arriving to Eugene for the national finals, Mayo suffered an injury to her quad muscle resulting in her withdrawal. In 2009, she helped A&M claim a collegiate record in the 4\u00d7100 (42.36) en route to an NCAA title., 4397=Queen Harrison, 2010 women\u2019s winner of The Bowerman, was the first female in NCAA Division I history to sweep national tiles in both the 100- and 400-meter hurdles. Brown could be the early favorite to be the second. Only Harrison, also an ACC foe, stood in Brown\u2019s way for both titles last year as the then-sophomore was national runner-up in both events last year. Brown sent a call to action after running a then-world leading 54.74 in the NCAA\u2019s 400 hurdle quarterfinals \u2013 the time would stand as the 13th best in the world in 2010. Over the summer, Brown, along with a NACAC title, would win each round on the way to a USATF 400-meter hurdle title where she put more than a full second ahead of the rest of the field in the final., 7504=Reid is coming off the fall cross country season with individual and team NCAA titles. Reid led the Wildcats to a second-straight NCAA cross country crown with her own national individual title, becoming the first since 1994 to win the individual NCAA title while leading their team to victory. On the track in 2010, Reid finished third in the 3000 at the national indoor meet and followed with a fourth-place showing in the 1500 at the NCAA outdoor meet. Indoors, Reid won Big East titles in the 1000 and mile and added a conference crown in the 800 outdoors.}",
