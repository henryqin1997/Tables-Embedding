As part of this request, we are conducting a survey of a random sample of transit agencies and asking you to complete a questionnaire via the Internet. Specifically, we are requesting transit agencies provide information about their experiences providing ADA paratransit services, including general information on agencies' paratransit service, compliance challenges, costs and demand changes, and practices agencies are using to improve ADA paratransit service. Please complete this questionnaire within 2 weeks of receipt. We understand there are great demands on your time; however, your cooperation is critical to providing the Congress with complete and balanced information on the provision of ADA paratransit services. We plan to complete our report during the fall, 2012. At that time, the report will be available on our website at http://www.gao.gov. GAO, the research arm of Congress, exists to support Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities and to help improve the performance and accountability of the federal government for the benefit of the American people. If you have any questions or need additional time, please contact the following individuals for assistance: The name, email, and telephone number of two GAO staff appeared here. .
