            "The individual showed signs of stress: defence threats, crouching, folded mouth, freezing, stereotypic behaviour, attacking (i.e. biting), scratching, scream or chitter vocalisations (Fitch-Snyder and Schulze 2001).",

            "Why its wrong",
            "Exotic animals are generally unfamiliar with human contact and forced proximity or handling can cause severe stress or discomfort (Morgan and Tromborg 2007).",
            "Lorises are nocturnal primates and being subjected to day light conditions, without reversing their light cycle or providing adequate night lighting, severely neglects their behavioural needs and impacts their health (Fitch -Synder & Schulze 2001, Nekaris & Bearder 2011).",
            "While stress can be considered a necessary requirement in predator avoidance, chronic stress can cause stereotypic and abnormal behaviours, and severely implicate health and psychological well-being (Morgan and Tromborg).",
            "Slow lorises are predominantly forest dwelling primates that move by slow climbing and bridging, and have home ranges between 2 and 20 hectares (Nekaris and Bearder 2011). Being housed in small cage enclosures, subjected to an environment which contains no substrate or vegetation does not meet basic slow loris behavioural needs (Fitch-Synder and Schulze 2001, Fitch-Synder 2008).",
            "Primates are social animals (Cowlishaw and Dunbar 2000) and suffer greatly when they are deprived of social interaction or stimuli (Mallapur and Choudhury 2003, Honess and Marin 2006)"

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{56082=The slow loris of Java is one of the most distinct of all of Asia\u2019s lorises. Its large eyes are surrounded by deep and dark forks that stretch down to the tips of its cheeks, and meet at the crown of its head to form a long stripe down its back. These beautiful stripes are so characteristic that it is no wonder that in 2003, after its initial discovery in the 18th century, that Javan slow lorises were confirmed as a distinct species., 58608=So in 2010, we started our wild studies of Javan slow lorises. In 2011, we attracted the attention of the BBC who decided to make a film about our research \u2013 the Jungle Gremlins of Java. This film served several remarkable purposes. From\u00a02009 onwards, the world got to know slow lorises through a series of viral videos that were cute at first glance but revealed the tip of the iceberg of a cruel and illegal pet trade. It had been hard to convince the viewing pubic why it was cruel to keep nocturnal animals awake in the day; tree dwelling animals with no branch to touch; exudate specialists made obese and diabetic on a diet of sugar rich fruit; social primates kept alone and apart from their own kind\u2026.the list goes on\u2026, 44574=On 29 November, BBC2 will air the award winning Jungle Gremlins of Java. This compelling documentary follows the research of Oxford Brookes University\u2019s Professor Anna Nekaris, director of the Little Fireface Project, as she seeks to understand the behaviour of the elusive slow loris and to conserve them in the wild., 59866=The trade has not stopped. The YouTube videos go on. People still want one as a pet\u2026and sadly the teeth of slow loris\u2019 are still being ripped out in the hope that they will not bite their owners with their unique venom. Jungle Gremlins of Java has made the rounds now in more than 52 countries, but has only aired once back in January 2012 here in the UK. We hope that the many new people introduced to slow lorises from those cute but cruel videos will get a chance to see the truth behind their story and help support the Little Fireface Project in the their efforts to save them., 57314=With every colleague that travelled to Java and witnessed the loris\u2019 plight there, the cry from that particular place became louder. Where were the wild lorises? So many in markets but none in forests\u2026and worse yet, those that were rescued inevitably had their teeth cut out\u2026so in 2006 I ventured to Java for the first time to see the illegal wildlife trade there and to help start the first major rescue centre for Indonesia\u2019s slow lorises. In simply measuring these lorises, we affirmed that Javan slow lorises were indeed a distinct species, and found evidence for two new species as well.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Table 1.\u00a0Violations of the five freedoms in slow loris vidoes. So here it is \u2013 a list of what any would-be slow loris conservationist needs to know, and ammunition to apply to the comments sections of YouTube videos\u2026WHY loris videos are cruel. The information will hopefully be published in a manuscript that I am preparing with my colleagues Asier Gil Vasquez and Louisa Musing, and are based on the five freedoms of animal welfare.\u00a0Watch this space for the upcoming paper! I am asked over and over again why slow loris videos are cruel \u2013 do they really show animal cruelty? It is hard to understand the behaviour and nuances of an animal that one has seen possibly for the first time on a video like \u2018slow loris eating riceball,\u2019 \u2018slow loris being tickled\u2019 or \u2018slow loris goes out for a walk.\u2019 But as a person who has studied these animals for more than 20 years \u2013 who knows them like Cesar Milan knows his dogs or Monty Roberts knows his horses \u2013 I can emphatically tell you that these videos are not only cruel \u2013 they break my heart. by Anna Nekaris 1 by admin 24/10/2014 Posted on",

Knowing these animals were stolen from the wild makes it all a bit worse. \u00a0 Posted in Conservation, Illegal Wildlife Trade, Little Fireface Project, Slow Loris | Tagged illegal wildlife trade, Loris Rice Ball, pet primates, Slow Loris, Tickling Slow Loris, Umbrella Loris, YouTube | 1 Reply Post navigation \u2190 Older posts",
