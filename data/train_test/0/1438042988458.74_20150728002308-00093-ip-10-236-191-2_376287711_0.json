But with that freedom come responsibility and certainly some danger. Every year for the past nine years, the number of motorcyclists killed on our nation\u2019s highways has increased. And sadly, motorcycle fatalities in Colorado are on the rise \u2014 from 45 fatalities in 1995, doubling to 90 deaths in 2007. The majority of last year\u2019s deaths occurred between May and October.}",
