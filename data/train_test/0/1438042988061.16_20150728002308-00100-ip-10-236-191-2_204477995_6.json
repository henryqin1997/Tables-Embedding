In humans, six genes have been identified that encode anti-apoptotic proteins characterized by the presence of conserved motifs designated as three Bcl-2 homology (BH) regions, BH1, BH2, and BH3 [Reed, et al. 2004]. These domains form a hydrophobic cleft in tertiary structure. Pro-apoptotic family members contain BH3 regions that form an amphipathic helix, and these helices bind in the clefts of the anti-apoptotic proteins. Overexpression of pro-apoptotic BH3 peptides has been shown to increase apoptosis of leukemia cells using in vitro and animal model studies [Holinger, et al. 1999; Wang et al. 2000; Walensky et al. 2004]. The binding of fluorochrome-conjugated BH3 peptides (including Bim) to Bcl-2 family members thus provides the basis for construction of fluorescence-based assays amenable to flow cytometry high throughput screening for small molecule regulators of these interactions.
