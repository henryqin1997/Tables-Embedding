Chambers has only made nine first team appearances for the Foxes so far after being held in initial high regard, but has struggled to have the desired impact with Nigel Pearson so far. The youth academy graduate became Leicester's youngest player when he entered the pitch aged 15 in a Carling Cup tie against Blackpool Town in 2005. Chambers has represented the national side at U17, U18 and most recently U19 level, picking up his first cap against Spain in February. The youngster will be elegible for Wycombe's tie with Norwich City tomorrow., 10639=Friendly - Rotherham 1-2 Leicester (Thursday July 30 2015), 16270=Time: 5:21PM, 11416=N'Golo Kante On Verge Of Arriving?
