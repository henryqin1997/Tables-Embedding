Pictures\u2019 and Legendary Pictures\u2019 epic sci-fi action adventure \u201cPacific Rim.\u201d When legions of monstrous creatures, known as Kaiju, started rising from the sea, a war began that would take millions of lives and consume humanity\u2019s resources for years on end. To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes\u2014a washed up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi)\u2014who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind\u2019s last hope against the mounting apocalypse. Oscar\u00ae nominee Guillermo del Toro (\u201cPan\u2019s Labyrinth\u201d) is directing \u201cPacific Rim\u201d from a script by Travis Beacham (\u201cClash of the Titans\u201d). Thomas Tull, Jon Jashni and Mary Parent are producing, with Callum Greene serving as executive producer. The film stars Charlie Hunnam (TV\u2019s \u201cSons of Anarchy\u201d), Idris Elba (\u201cThor\u201d), Rinko Kikuchi (\u201cThe Brothers Bloom\u201d), Charlie Day (\u201cHorrible Bosses\u201d), and Ron Perlman (the \u201cHellboy\u201d films). The ensemble cast also includes Max Martini, Robert Kazinsky, Clifton Collins, Jr., Burn Gorman, Larry Joe Campbell, Diego Klattenhoff, and Brad William Henke. Del Toro\u2019s behind-the-scenes team includes Academy Award\u00ae-winning director of photography Guillermo Navarro, production designer Andrew Neskoromny, editor Peter Amundson, and costume designer Kate Hawley. Slated for release in Summer 2013, \u201cPacific Rim\u201d is a presentation of Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures. The film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.}",
