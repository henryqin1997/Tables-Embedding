They offered a 'stay for 4 nights, pay for 3 deal' - and I see that they still have this deal going. http://www.krabisandsea.com/Roomrates.aspx Cost for basic fan room is 1350/baht per night in low season, and 1950/baht high season (which is when you will be there). A fair bit more for aircon room (refer to the site for full range of prices). Personally, I would suggest staying in Railay West. You can get amazing sunsets, and there\u2019s an OK beach for swimming. There is also a small 'walking street' that runs up away from the beach with a few shops, etc. The beach on the east side, whilst picturesque at high tide, is basically a mangrove \u2018swamp\u2019 at lowtide. The east probably has more atmosphere for the budget traveller (esp at night) - with more budget accomodation and restaurants. We walked to the east side each night for meals and had a drink or two at the 'Bob Marley' style bars. We were there in early June so it was reasonably quiet in there - which was perfectly OK with me. It might be quite different at Christmas time though. It only takes 5 mins to walk from west to east, so it probably doesn\u2019t really matter which side you stay on. The nicest beach, however, is accessed from the East. I think there was one upper end resort there - but no one appeared to be staying at the resort! Go to the southern end of the east side, and find the track that follows along the cliffs for about 5-10 mins. Gorgeous sand, turquoise warm water \u2013 just awesome for lying back in the water for hours and staring up at the limestone cliffs. Hope that helps a bit., 9791=Joined Travelfish 14th April, 2008 Location Global Village Posts: 1979 Total reviews: 5 Places visited: At least 2, 9030=#7 Posted: 5/8/2009 - 20:12, 11551=admin Joined Travelfish 21st January, 2004 Location Indonesia Posts: 7221 Total reviews: 24 Places visited: At least 113, 4671=#11 Posted: 11/10/2012 - 01:35, 15636=#2 Posted: 4/8/2009 - 05:43, 6188=Joined Travelfish 23rd September, 2011 Location United States Posts: 14}",
