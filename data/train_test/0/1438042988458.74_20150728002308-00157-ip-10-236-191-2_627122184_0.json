Stein definitely appears to have qualified for the ballot - having delivered 12,000 certified signatures (2,000 more than required) to state election authorities in advance of their August 3rd deadline. That means she has a statistically significant number of supporters. Plus the Green-Rainbow party has gotten more than one percent of the vote on a number of occasions in statewide races, and even had official party status for a few years after Stein's run for the Governor's seat in 2002 got them over 3 percent of the vote. They are hardly newcomers on the Mass. political scene. And even if they were, they've proved they're a significant enough force to get on the ballot, and that should be enough to satisfy the local mainstream media. Who, last time I checked, are not a branch of government - and shouldn't be able to veto participation in debates for a major government office.}",
