    "textAfterTable": "Dorm Life Living on campus was the best choice I ever made. I have made the best friends of my life in the semester I have been a resident student at RMU. And even beyond that, the Student Life department does a very good job of ensuring there are things to do on campus. Primarily we screen a movie almost every Friday and we have open mic every Tuesday night. Then, there's almost always something more. Also, a lot of the dorms will host their own events. Academic Rigor My experience may be slightly swayed because I'm a media arts student and my first semester included a communication skills course, a math course, intro to psychology, and an art and a video course. So, the communication skills class was the only traditionally rigorous course (assignments and papers), while the art courses were a drawing per week or the production elements of a project. But, from my experience in my first week of my second semester, I'm seeing that this will be a more rigorous set or courses for me. So, it varies but overall the work can be a challenge, but I don't believe it could ever bury you. And in any such case, we offer free tutoring services.
