When Vrieze joined the family business, the herd transitioned from being a commercial herd to a registered herd, consisting of 60 cows; he also sold embryos and bulls nationally and internationally. In 1989, Vrieze sold the original registered herd and placed his focus on marketing embryos. By the mid-1990s, though, he decided to return to being a dairy producer and, in 1997, Baldwin Dairy was built. Emerald Dairy followed two years later with Emerald Dairy II and the TMF facility finishing construction in 2001., 8342=About Emerald Dairy Emerald Dairy is located in St. Croix County, Wisconsin, and was founded by John Vrieze.
