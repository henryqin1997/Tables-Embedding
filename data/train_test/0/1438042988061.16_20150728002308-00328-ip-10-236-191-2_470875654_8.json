    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Having thus described the invention, what is desired to be protected by Letters Patent is presented in the subsequently appended claims. Since other modifications and changes varied to fit particular operating requirements and environments will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the invention is not considered limited to the example chosen for purposes of disclosure, and covers all changes and modifications which do not constitute departures from the true spirit and scope of this invention. Referring now to FIG. 6, there is shown an enlarged, plan view of another embodiment of a latch 80 in accordance with the invention. In this embodiment, a handle 82 is shown disposed intermediate both ends of the latch 80. The assembly 50 can be extracted from its housing by pulling handle 82 in the direction shown by arrow 84. Of course, the assembly 50 can be reinserted into its housing by reversing the direction of the extraction force, thus pushing the assembly downwardly, as shown in this FIGURE. Referring now to FIG. 5, there is shown an enlarged, plan view of an alternate embodiment of latch 60. A handle 62 is pivotally connected to an intermediate member 64 by means of a pivot 66. Intermediate member 64 is joined to a retractable member 65 by another pivot 67. The opposite side of handle 62 is pivotally connected to a second intermediate member 68 by means of a second",
