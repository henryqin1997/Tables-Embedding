COMM 4325 may be replaced with MGT 3320. Certain courses (COMM 3324 and 4330) may be taken more than once (when topics vary) for credit within the degree program. 3Foreign Language/Study Abroad, select 6 SCH in course work (not credit by exam) above the university\u2019s foreign language graduation requirement. Thus students who meet the university\u2019s foreign language graduation requirement by earning 6 hours of credit by exam, may take 6 SCH in the same language but at the intermediate level or above, or they may take 6 SCH of another foreign language at the introductory level. This requirement may also be met by earning 6 SCH in any subject while participating in a TAMIU-approved Study Abroad program while living for at least 5 weeks in a non-English speaking country. NOTE 1: Concentration in Media Production: Will be earned if 15 SCH of the work done for the major are taken from COMM 2331, 3102/3202, 3123/3223, 3132/3232, 3133/3233, 3309, 3327 or 4330 (if topic has a media focus). Students desiring a Concentration in Media Production noted on their transcript must request it on their Application for Graduation. NOTE 2: Students who do not elect to have a minor curriculum may use up to 9 hours of their available electives in addiaitonl courses in their major curriculum.
