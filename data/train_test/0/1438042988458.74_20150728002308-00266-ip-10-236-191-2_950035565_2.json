    "textAfterTable": "Preinstallation Tasks Before you install and use the VMware vCenter Chargeback Manager application, you must perform the following tasks. For detailed pre-install and pre-upgrade instructions, refer to the vCenter Chargeback Manager Install and Upgrade Guide. Create a vCenter Chargeback Manager database and database user You must create a database for vCenter Chargeback Manager to store the application-specific data. Ensure that this database is not configured to be case-sensitive. In addition, you must also create a database user having permissions to create and delete schema, as well as read from and write to the database. Set a static IP address on the machine You must set a static IP address on the machine on which you plan to install vCenter Chargeback Manager. You can obtain a static IP address from your network administrator. Preferably, obtain and set static IP addresses on all the servers and databases that the application will communicate with. In the case of a multi-homed machine, you can configure vCenter Chargeback Manager with only one interface. That is to say, although you can install vCenter Chargeback Manager on a multi-homed machine, you can use only the IP address or FQDN that you provide during the installation to access and use vCenter Chargeback Manager. Also, if the different components, such as data collectors and vCenter Servers, in a vCenter Chargeback Manager setup are installed on multi-homed machines, vCenter Chargeback Manager communicates with these components by using the URL specified when configuring the components",
