The dorm life there is nice, but cramped, since 2011 had so many freshmen enrolled (both in and out of state). If you are an in-state student, my suggestion would be to live with your relatives and if you're an out-of-state student, live in the dorms (unless you have relatives living in the state of Alabama as well)., 82558=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Tips for prospective students Get involved and go to the events that they have! They can be really fun and are a great way to meet friends! Bang for the buck Snead gives out a good bit of scholarships, therefore when you transfer to your four year university you don't mind spending more money. Even if you don't recieve a scholarship, Snead is very reasonable and is a great school! Did enjoy being here",
