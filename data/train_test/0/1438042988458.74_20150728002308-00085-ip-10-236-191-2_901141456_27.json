            "The campus safety is very good, because they have a system which text messages every student at the school if something goes wrong, called the 'BC Alert' system. There are also 'call boxes' for emergencies all around the school, as well as local patrolling security during all hours.",
            "None, as far as I know of.",
            "I've seen a great amount of unique types of clubs and activities in the school, one of my favorite being the 'Brain Buster' club which partakes in active trivia for scholarship money. It's a lot of fun.",
            "Hard working students who are not afraid of a very open campus with lots of people to talk to and meet. Social people will also love this campus. It's also a great place to try many different types of things, so it's very hard for me to think of types of students whom it will NOT be good for.",
            "Because of the large selection of classes and high quality of specialized classes, this is really an incredible financial option for the AA degree seeker. Broward College now offers some BA degrees as well, which they even have special financing for certain majors, as there is a high demand for certain types of work in South Florida, and you may way to look into if your looking for some spare cash.",
            "They often have community events at the school, where they have DJs, performers, and free food available very often in the heart of the school grounds. There are also a lot of free musical and theater events for students, as well as visits from politicians like Michelle Obama, which happened just two days ago.",
            "A very decent cafeteria, they have a very healthy/delicious meat and vegetable wrap center. At the hot food area, the pizza is pretty gross , however I like the Jamaican Beef patties. I've seen ads that they are developing a bunch of local healthy food chains into the school within a year, so when that comes up I think it will deserve 4 stars.",
            "There really aren't dorms in this community college, I do not know many that there are, but there are apartments being developed on the same street as the campus for those who wish to live right on the school.",
            "Many classes are very difficult, which is truly what you want in a community college, as you will actually learn about the subject you are studying. Be prepared to work, and the harder you work the more benefits you reap.",
            "Research your professors beforehand, because there are fantastic ones and terrible ones. The education is in the professor, not the institution. Always be striving to discover your passion if you haven't already, it's the one thing you truly need to know before graduating.",
            "A big school with lots of opportunities, and lots of friends to make. There are great professors, and some mediocre, so do your research and homework before signing up for everything. Take the time and go to your advisers and financial aid offices, to make sure you're making the most of your time and money at Broward College."

For example, I was a member of the North Campus Art Club but Central Campus & Downtown have different art club chapters. North campus clubs are very involved in student life. The student life awards take place in April every year and all members have a chance to win something!, 1163274=last time i was at north campus they had a chocolate fest in February and they had parties every once in a while , for valentines day etc. they also had a chili cook off a few weeks ago., 726547=For the amount of money paid and the results that I have received through my studies at Broward College I am extremely impressed. This year Broward College was a top ten contender for the best college in America, we will find out in March 2013 if we win the Aspen Award for $1,000,000.00., 652311=Not much of a traditional college. Celebrates 9/11, Constitution Day, Multicultural month every year, along with some other things. North Campus is re-opening the OMNI Auditorium January 2013 which will allow the campus to host basketball and volleyball games., 611065=I really only attend pines and miramar campus and they don't have any., 603018=the south campus usually has a few cops that stay guarding the campus and miramar town center has plenty of cops patrolling, 169723=Last year, I paid a little over $1800 for 18 credit hours. Classes were $98/credit for in-state students when I last checked., 357369=There are 3 broward college campuses located in the following areas in Florida: Pembroke Pines, Davie, and Ft.-lauderdale. there are 3 centers, located in the following areas: Weston, Miramar, and Sheridan., 552276=Although this school is not focus a lot in it's food and dining service some changes are coming in the 2012 fall term, they are adding more vary to the food selection., 802311=Yes!! The tuition fees are low. Broward College, by the way, is one of the top 10 colleges in the Nation. It has an amazing nursing program and since 2006, has had 12 Jack Kent Cook scholarship recipients!, 85444=The school has events at the end of every month. Each event is different. Usually they are based on what is being celebrated that month. For example in November we had a fall event that had rides and games all over the campus like a miniature carnival., 171724=There's a reason why Broward was one of the top ten community colleges in the nation in 2013. These courses are no easier than any 4-year university course and it truly challenges students. The myth that community college is easy is no longer accurate. I transferred from a 4-year university to Broward College and my classes are more rigorous here., 530507=Take professor Benham for ENC1101. He is a great teacher!, 363431=if you need anything from the office go very early as it gets full after 9:30. You will be waiting for hours., 163670=For most of my classes, I basically breezed through. I was never one for school, but I wanted to afford myself better opportunities in life. As I took class after class at BC, I came to realize that the school was just a joke. I can't remember how many of these classes that I attended without ever opening a textbook. The instructors require that you buy the textbooks before class begins, but most of them don't even work from the textbook; they just wing it. I wasted a lot of money on books that I never even used, but at least was able to sell them online. Do this: Read review after review and look at all of the mistakes in grammar. These are college students writing these reviews. Do the same at ratemyprofessor.com. Check out the reviews for the Broward College english teachers and you'll see so many reviews where the students state that they passed with a reasonable grade, but pay attention to the grammar errors. These people passed a college level english class with those errors. If I were a professor, I would have failed those students without hesitation. Good old Broward College., 749904=Broward College offers many clubs and activities to get the students involved. For example, there is club week, where many of the clubs here at Broward showcase some of their benefits of joining. As far as activities, my favorite activity would be the Yoga classes offered Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10:00 a.m. I feel so much more relaxed throughout the week taking these classes., 683957=Safety here is a concern I've fortunately never had to deal with I once had a night class that ended at 9:30 there is always campus security around and parking lots are available near any class you'll have., 35429=Attending Broward college would save you more money than you'll expect to spend. Broward College charges about 77 dollars per credit course. I'm a full time student taking 5 classes, i spend and overall of 2300 dollars and that includes the price for new books!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here Broward College may be a 4 year school, but this is not where I am destined to graduate from. I am very grateful for the education that I am currently receiving, but for the price of admission and classes I strongly disagree with the amount of learning resources available. The students need more technology in the classrooms to have visual reference to the subjects in question. Aside from the lack of technology, Broward College is another mediocre public college that accomplishes what it's aimed to do. Am learning a lot Although Broward College is a great campus for the locals residing in South Florida, I've come to notice that many professors do not posses the required discipline, and lecture skills, to be qualified as a professor. Broward College offers many different classes at different hours of the day, which is convenient for many working students. From my own personal experience, however, I conclude that a minority of professors do not appear in class with their resources prepared, and fail to carry out the ideal lectures aimed to keep the student's interest afloat. I hold mentors with highest respect possible, they are the guiding hand of every young aspiring student destined to achieve prosperity. Having the option to choose from a variety of courses is detrimental, however, it does not invalidate",
