To avoid NFS hanging up the system and immunity from the kill command, use the \"intr\" option to allow the process to be interrupted.

Typically this problem is solved by using a single point of authentication. Use NIS or LDAP. NEVER EVER mount to a user's home directory. i.e. /home/user1/mount-point This is because when the user is removed from the system with the command userdel -r user1, the user's home directory is wiped and all subdirectories including the path below the mount point will be erased!!
