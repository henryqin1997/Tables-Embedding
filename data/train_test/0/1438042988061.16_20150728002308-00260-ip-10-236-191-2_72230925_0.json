The value for this parameter can be: true \u2013 the gateway is part of a server pool deployment. In addition, enable, on, yes, and 1 are also valid values. If you set this parameter to true, you must provide a value for httpbind.pool.nodeId. false \u2013 (default) the gateway is not part of a server pool deployment. Leaving the value blank (empty string) is also a valid value.",

If the value of this parameter is less than the value for the JEP 124 hold attribute in the client request, the value for this parameter will be set to hold+1. Do not set this parameter to 1, as doing so could severely degrade performance. See httpbind.hold for more information.",

Instant Messaging XMPP/HTTP Gateway Configuration Parameters The httpbind.conf file is initialized by the configure utility and should be modified only as described in this guide. Note \u2013 If you make changes to httpbind.conf, you must refresh the gateway's web container in order for the new configuration settings to take effect. Within a value, if any special characters like comma, space, newline, tab, double quotes, or backslash are present, the entire value needs to be within double quotes. In addition, every carriage return, line feed, tab, backslash, and double quotes within the value must specified with a backslash (\\). Multiple values in the value string are separated using commas (,). The key consists of all the characters in the line starting with the first non-whitespace character and up to the first ASCII equal sign (=) or semi-colon (;). If the key is terminated by a semi-colon, it is followed by \u201clang-\u201d and a tag that indicates the language in which this value is to be interpreted. The language tag is followed by an equal sign (=). All whitespace characters before and after the equal sign are ignored. All remaining characters on the line become part of the associated value string. Each line is terminated by a line terminator (\\n, \\r, or \\r\\n).",
