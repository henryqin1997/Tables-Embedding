From AAA to the majors. You know he is going to hit around .300. OBP wise is a question mark due to the dearth of walks. What is different is that the home run output has increased. Doubles have decreased. Although the last two games he has been getting some good line drives off the wall instead of pop ups. He's still a work in progress.But Espinosa, if he conquers the platoon bat nothing is stopping him from becoming a super star., 95045=Will said\u2026 Espinosa leads all rookies in XBHs, HRs, RBIs, OPS and SBs. He also leads all 2B in UZR. Think that makes him a pretty clear cut ROY candidate. June 17, 2011 6:45 AM\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014I know Turner from the Mets and Collmenter from Arizona are looking good too and some kid named Wilson Ramos!!!!If Espy gets that Batting Average over .250 which is that line of respectibility then he certainly looks like the ROY. Still over 1/2 a season to go.A shame he had that error because it is him and Brandon Phillips for the Gold Glove at 2nd base., 21668=5:10, Riggleman will be gone long before Desmond, unless something really unlikely happens. Glad I could clear that up for you,, 25154=5:10, if the Nats keep on winning like this they most likely will extend Riggleman's contract. So I guess you will root against the home team, is that right?, 80998=In the spirit of Wonk and Outsider, from the previous thread, this morning: Unkyd said\u2026Oh\u2026and that new hitting coach is working out well, too!!! Clearly nothing was gonna change, with that clown, Eckstein, running things\u2026 What's that? Eck is still here?! Well, he must have switched brands of chew, or something\u2026 maybe a shot of Genius Juice, in his coffee?June 16, 2011 10:16 AM hehehe\u2026, 87979=About as old as me, I reckon. I kinda thought he looked like Patton's dog, Willie, but good call. Did I mention the senior special next Thursday? ;-)Oh, and nice to see that good inning from Burnett.Sec3MySofa said\u2026 how old do you have to be for Nix to look like Spuds McKenzie to you?

Oh, how sweet it is to be out of the cellar! June 16, 2011 10:15 PM _____________________________Here is the latest adjustments that Danny has made from the left side. He had shortened his swing in mid-May and then he seemed to go back to the long swing. He has worked this last homestand on shortening the swing again but he also isn't taking that long stride where he and Eckstein thought it was too much going on in his set-up. Tonight you also saw him take an outside pitch to left field which really shows he is going with the pitch.Nice to see everything coming together for him.For as much crap as Eckstein takes, 3 guys just speak his praise in Ryan Zimmerman, Michael Morse and Danny Espinosa. I know the offense has suffered but you need good hitters to get good hits., 20560=http://web.worldbaseballclassic.com/stats/index.jsp?team=cubI found this interesting about Yunesky Maya in the 2009 World Baseball Classic (WBC) when he pitched for Cuba. He only started one game and was a relief pitcher in 2 games.He is another player in the Nats system that will most likely end up being a spot starter or may be worth looking at him as a reliever., 96213=Gonat said\u2026 @ June 16, 2011 5:22 PM http://web.worldbaseballclassic.com/stats/index.jsp?team=cubI found this interesting about Yunesky Maya in the 2009 World Baseball Classic (WBC) when he pitched for Cuba.

Me: I was at all the games in San Diego, and Maya didn't impress me (Aroldis Chapman impressed a little more). But the most impressive I saw during that week of games was Japanese pitcher Yu Darvish; he is a #1 in the Majors when he gets over here. Dice-K was on that team and Darvish was way better., 39558=I think Anon at 5:10 had to be kidding. Ian is great defensively and he's had a hit in the last nine or ten games. By now, everyone knows he is a keeper., 1776=CARDINALS at NATIONALS Where: Nationals Park Gametime: 7:05 p.m. TV: MASN Radio: WJFK (106.7 FM), WFED (1500 AM), XM 186 Weather: Thunderstorms, 75 degrees, Wind out to LF, 35916=Anonymous8 said\u2026 Time to exploit Lance Berkman in rightfield. The guy makes Adam Dunn in the outfield look good. June 16, 2011 4:05 PM ____________________________Yep, glad they hit one to Berkman. He got it so shallow in RF and skipped the throw to the catcher!}",
