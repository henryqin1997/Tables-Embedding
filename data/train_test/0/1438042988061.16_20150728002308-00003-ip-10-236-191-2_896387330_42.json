We always have an open salad and cereal (so when in doubt!). For those people that don't do gluten then there is always a gluten free option of the meal. The food is mostly always good. You will see the same meal every time throughout the semester but you will always get a surprise here or there. The dining is good (in Fall 2012 the new DC will be revealed). With the new DC there is going to be a lot of options of where to eat. What I find nice is that professor come and eat with us along with there families. It's always nice to see the theology department start a debate and students start crowding around.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Senior Expedition visit days are extremely fun, but for a more accurate view of the school visit campus another time. Bang for the buck It seems SO expensive - but they really do provide some great scholarships. Some parts of attending here are less of a bang for the buck than others; such as the meal plan. Am enjoying being here Everyone is so friendly here; it is easy to get involved with any group of friends or any activity. There is not a lot of diversity religiously speaking, but that is great for many people. With Jackson so close there are many opportunities for volunteerism. Am learning a lot Many classes freshman year were not intellectually challenging. However, once you get into classes for your major there is a lot more to be learned.
