My mind changed at summer orientation when I saw all of the clubs and opportunities Chico actually gave you. -If you have a meal plan try and organize how many meals a week you should be having. Because both semesters I had so many meals left over and the last week I tried to eat around 5 times a day! -Be prepared for both extreme heat from August to early October, and extreme cold in the winter. And when I say extreme I mean extreme for someone from the Bay Area. (100degrees and 30degrees), 217698=Okay, I'm going to divide the food and dining into two categories-the dining hall on campus and dining out in town. The Sutter Dining Hall was only recently opened in 2011, so it's extremely new and modern. However, the food options aren't necessarily the greatest. But I guarantee if you ask anyone at any school, they'll all tell you that they're dining hall stinks. Now as for downtown dining, it's awesome. There's a great pizza place called Celestino's (it's been a huge staple while I've lived in Chico), and also a burger/bar joint called The Bear (you have to try the jiffy burger...yes, it's a burger with peanut butter on it!), 584889=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Chico is not just a wonderful campus with the most knowlegable professors, it is also a beautiful town and great place to live. There are really nice dog parks to go to and the local swimming holes that are popular as well. All colleges are going to be expensive, but it feels better to be paying for an education AND a great local community and town with the same check! Am enjoying being here I have only met the best people and friends at Chico. It is easy to get into that party scene, but with the challenging academics, focusing on school is just as easy and way more important. Everyone always says people only go to Chico State for the partying, but I always say that im there to get one of the best buiness degrees in the state of CA. Am learning a lot As a business student at Chico State, it is very competetive and i feel that the teachers are there not only to teach you the information required, but also give you real hands on experience with the subject matter.
