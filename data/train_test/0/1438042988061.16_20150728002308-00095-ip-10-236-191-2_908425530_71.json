            "LBCC has an active club life with plenty of activities for clubs to do.",
            "Clubs are great for students who are already outgoing, or for students who have never been involved in school activities.",
            "LBCC has a homecoming in the fall, and has a Spring Sing and Mini Grand Prix event in the spring. Intramural sports are also popular on campus and bring clubs together in a fun, competitive way.",
            "Get involved by joining a club. That will be all the fun you will need.",
            "I wish they had better food. Most food isn't tasty or healthy, and the dining area needs to be remodeled.",
            "Im not quite sure if LBCC has dorms.",
            "Take courses that have long sequences first like math or chemistry. Get involved in a campus club to increase your networking and your experience while at LBCC. Do not be afraid or ashamed to seek tutoring if you are not doing well in a course.",
            "This school allows a student to explore different majors, so its a great school to attend if a student is not sure what to study. Most professors are challenging and encouraging. There are plenty of tutoring and transfer resources, which, appeal to students seeking to eventually obtain a bachelor's degree at another school."

The construction may cause a bit of a mess in terms of parking but the new nursing building will be beautiful., 419723=TIP do not over take any classes, you will fail, it's not like highschool, take your education seriously since you're paying for it, it's a different life in college, it's difficult and not financially stable at times if you don't have everything sorted out, I didn't which is making things difficult, I don't even know if I'm getting the education I want for upcoming semester of Spring 2014. Do not procrastinate in turning in your FAFSA, make sure you talk to a counselor, do not be shy, it's your future, your goals, and your career you're wanting here. I wish I WOULD'VE done all of those things. I WOULD'VE been on track and not slipping back., 21590=I started here in the fall of 2010 and currently still attending. Long Beach City college it's a really good school with the most helpful teachers. The staff are great as well and everyone is friendly. It has a really good learning environment and plenty of sources for you to succeed.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck LBCC helps its students succeed by lowering prices for things like books and parking. Parking passes never surpass $25, and there are also some free spaces available near campus as well. EOP&S is a program that will help pay for your books, and other expenses you may have that Financial Aid will not cover. You will also have access to state of the art classrooms and computers that the school has recently purchased. Long Beach City College is continuously growing and building new things that students will love. You may be paying for Community College, but besides a dorm, you'll feel like you're at a university. Am enjoying being here Long Beach is a very culturally diverse city. It seems like there is no one race that takes majority. You are able to make great friends on a beautiful campus with many amenities and resources at your disposal. The school parties and sports games are very exciting as well. Another cool detail is, if you do not like the campus you are currently at, LBCC has TWO campuses to choose from, The Liberal Arts Campus near Lakewood Mall and the Pacific Coast Campus located near Downtown Long Beach. Am learning a lot Rememnber your favorite",
