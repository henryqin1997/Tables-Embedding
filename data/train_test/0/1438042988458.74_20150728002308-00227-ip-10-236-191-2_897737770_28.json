    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Tips for prospective students I would suggest leaving your car at home unless you have a vehicle with 4 wheel drive, the roads get pretty bad and unless you know how to drive on the snow/ice, you should really stick to walking. Bang for the buck It has very cheap tuition, and there is a lot of money saving things on campus, like the free movie theater that has different movies each week, their are two galleries on campus and you can rent rollarblades and bikes with your student ID. Am enjoying being here Its a small town, so you can basically walk everywhere and where you can not walk to the school has a shuttle program set up to take you and drop you off. Am learning a lot The general education classes can be on the bigger side, but for you core classes that are about you major they are small class sizes so that you can work one on one with your teacher. All teachers are willing to work with you and the school has tutoring for every class that is offered.",
