Joining him was current head coach Sean Payton. In their first year together, the team went 10-6, won the NFC South, and lost to the Chicago Bears in the NFC Championship game. Brees had a solid year though, showing that he had the potential talent to share the spotlight with Manning and Brady. Below is a comparison of Brees, Brady, and Manning from that 2006 season, as well as the two years after.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{5858=In 2006, the season where Tom Brady was at his worst despite winning 12 games, Brady was backed by a defense that ranked in the top 10 against both the pass and rush. Even if Brady had a bad game, the defense was there to pick up the pieces, netting Brady \"the win\"., 25565=Thu Jan 2, 13440=Despite his passing success, the wins, and his second-ranked Passing NEP in 2013, Brees was still being overlooked as an MVP candidate. Russell Wilson and Tom Brady garnered more attention for the award than Brees did, despite having efficiency scores that were half as good as Brees'., 2956=We all know the reason Manning and Brady are always in the spotlight is because of wins. Brady had one of his worst seasons in 2006, yet he still won 12 games, losing in the AFC Championship (to Manning, of course). The Patriots' passer has averaged 12 wins a season throughout his career, and never won less than nine in a given season. Manning had two seasons were he won less than 10 games, averaging 11 wins a season over his career. Brees, on the other hand, has averaged nine wins a season throughout his career, but that was in no small effort on his part. He did everything he could, but his defense didn't always back him up., 12263=2011 was a lot of the same. Manning missed the season, so Brees finally had a chance to win the MVP award. But then the Super Bowl winning Packers went on a tear, winning 19 games in a row (going back to 2010), finishing the season 15-1. Aaron Rodgers had his best year as a pro and went on to win the MVP award that year. Brees finished second yet again, and it was even more of a blowout than when Brees lost to Manning in 2009. However, it was the Saints quarterback with a higher Passing NEP, not Green Bay's passer., 2577=According to our Passing Net Expected Points (NEP) data, Brees wasn't far behind the two prolific passers despite an off year in 2007, his only season with the Saints where he contributed below 100 Passing Net Expected Points. Brees finished with a higher Passing NEP than Manning in 2008, contributing more for his team through the air than Manning did for his., 21372=Tue Jan 7, 31993=Thu Jul 30, 13791=In all, since 2009, Brees has contributed more points than both Brady and Manning in the passing game with a total Passing NEP of 840.65. However, Manning didn't play in the 2011 season. Even with that, Manning still has the better better Passing NEP than Tom Brady (770.57 to 758.76). There's little doubt that Manning would have had a better Passing NEP than Brees had he played that season (would need about 70 Passing Net Expected Points, which he does every season), but nevertheless, Brees has been playing at an incredibly high level in comparison. And we have to remember that Manning's numbers are stronger due to his record-breaking 2013 campaign., 12841=Brees had a down year in 2012, but he was without head coach Sean Payton for the first time in his career as a Saint. He maintained his yards thrown and touchdown passes, but had his worst Success Rate since 2006. Brees turned only 51.72% of his drop backs into a positive NEP gain., 34686=The Least Successful Wide Receivers From 2014, 11275=In 2009, the Saints put together a prolific offense, as they were tops in the league in total yards as well as total points scored (40 points ahead of the next closest team). The Patriots were sixth, the Colts were seventh. In the process, Brees was one of 10 quarterbacks to throw over 4,000 yards. His 34 touchdown passes led the league, with Peyton Manning and Brett Favre finishing with one less touchdown pass. Brees finished third in Passing NEP among 27 quarterbacks that dropped back to pass at least 300 times., 23449=Wed Jan 15, 6798=During 2009 to today, here's how each of their numbers stack up against each other., 19255=Wed Dec 11, 47812=\u00a9 2009-2015 numberFire, Inc. All rights reserved. Stop stealing our stuff and ripping off our features, please., 14811=While Brady is today's Montana, Brees is almost like Dan Marino, even though he has a ring. Manning, to be truthful, is incomparable. But when it comes down to it, Brees deserves to be in the same conversation as Manning and Brady. In fact, Brees may be the better comparison for Manning alone, especially since 2009., 6151=Brees, who had the eighth-highest Passing NEP in 2007, won just seven games. His fault? Probably not, as the Saints had the worst pass defense, and a run defense that was a little below average. That type of defensive performance has been the norm for Brees throughout his career, perhaps skewing the way some folks view him., 24835=Peyton Manning broke every record he could in 2013, and has some incredible numbers to show for it., 20243=A Review of the 2013 Fantasy Football Season: Quarterbacks, 31187=2015 NFC South Preview: Can the Panthers Extend Their Streak?, 22753=Matt Ryan is the best rookie quarterback we've seen since 2000., 27512=Tue Nov 26}",

Below is a comparison of Brees, Brady, and Manning from that 2006 season, as well as the two years after. Pre-Super Bowl Brees Signal-callers obviously contribute heavily to the game due to the control they have during the contest. If we take a look at our Passing Net Expected Points data, however, we can compare any quarterback we want on a much deeper level. As we dig deep on Brees, Manning, and Brady, you will see that Drew Brees is just as good as the spotlight stars. You could argue that he's been better of late. In the example above, Quarterback \"A\" could be considered Drew Brees. In Week 14, he became the fifth, and quickest, quarterback to amass 50,000 passing yards. Instead of analyzing the feat, folks were more worried about Peyton Manning (Quarterback \"B\") and Tom Brady (Quarterback \"C\"), two quarterbacks who had faced off against one another in the week prior. Forget Brees' accomplishments - it's more important, to some, to look at a game matchup between quarterbacks. The worst thing about quarterback",
