            "a robbery took place at a bank a couple months ago. it made me feel unsafe. i really want to feel safer here.",
            "i do not have an opinion on greek life. i have not pledged to a sorority, nor a co-ed fraternity. i have considered joining a sorority at times, though.",
            "i have participated in club sports. i have played for an intramural softball team. i have also played for an intramural soccer team.",
            "this school is great for outdoors-loving students. the campus is suited for individuals with a greater need for one on one attention. students whom need to feel recognized in class would do well here.",
            "our campus hosts a particularly odd intramural sport, known as hvz. hvz stands for humans versus zombies. in this sport, zombies chase humans around campus, playing the ultimate game of freeze tag.",
            "i find it hard to justify some of the charges that are applied to our tuition. for example, the school recently added in a fountain to the center of campus, which totals at $2,000 added to our tuition. i wish they would find more efficient ways to add beauty to our campus.",
            "there is not much to do in the surrounding area, unless you are extremely into hiking, or other wilderness activities. my friends and i often travel a short distance away to asheville, nc for some night life fun, there is a really neat club called base camp cullowhee which is an outdoors participant group.",
            "the food at western is good. the dining could improve it's services by bringing in more diverse foods. there should be more restaurant options made available to students on campus.",
            "the dorm life is not very appealing. spacing for individuals is cramped at best, and i found that most people had issues with their roommate at some point. dorm living is more convenient that living off campus.",
            "it would seem that all of the science specific courses are particularly challenging. most other courses, such as liberal studies courses are much easier, and less rigorous. the nursing program is quite challenging itself.",
            "bring a bicycle to ride around campus on. pack your lunches to avoid paying high prices at campus dining locations. rally for better parking accommodations.",
            "western is a culturally diverse school. instruction is delivered on an individual basis. professors are available to serve the needs of all students during convenient office hours."

There are call boxes everywhere on campus where you can call the campus police if you feel unsafe. There are also cat trans that drive around campus till 2:00 am and will drop you off anywhere on campus., 464221=I will tell you the truth and you may either love it or decide that this school is not for you. Personally, I love Western and I wouldn't want to attend college anywhere else. Western Carolina University, is located in Cullowhee. There is nothing in college except for the college, a gas station, a bar, and apartments. We had a few restaurants off campus, but they were burnt down this year unfortunately due to a kitchen fire. They are working on rebuilding the restaurants, and they will be ready by 2016. Outside of Cullowhee, is this town called Sylva. There is a lot of places to eat in town but mostly fast food restaurants. You will find a Walmart, banks, Ingles, Food lion, a bowling alley, a small movie theatre, and small shops. Downtown is kind of fun, if you want to spend the day walking around, going to a coffee shop, and just relaxing. So the question is what to do for fun. You have to make great friends, this will come easy because the school is small. You'll probably go to many bon-fires with your friends, off of campus. You may spend your night by a fire, laying on a hammock, and grilling out. You'll go hiking, and when I say hiking I mean vigorous hiking. A lot of the trails are for experienced people but there is also a lot of easy ones. There is a total of seven near by waterfalls that you can find, and go on an adventure while you are there. You'll go to college sporting events and show your catamount pride. Our football team may not be the best, but were pretty much great at every other sport. You'll probably spend a lot of time looking at each other figuring out what to do. Small parties are more popular here than huge parties. If your over 21, you will probably go to the bar a lot. If your under 21, you better be careful and not get caught under age drinking! There are many parties, but you will figure out which ones are safe and which ones are not. A lot of people join Greek Life to make friends and have stuff to do. You don't have to join Greek Life in order to be involved in school, but if you have a hard time making friends I would do it. You'll also probably visit places like Cherokee (15 min away) and Gatlinburg (45 min away)., 108885=The dining hall is fairly new, it was finished in 2009. Upstairs all you can eat, downstairs Asian, Mexican, burgers, McAlisters, and of course Starbucks. In the University Center we also have Papa Johns, Chick-fil-a, and Einsteins., 68261=Absolutely love greek life! Western's greek life has grow so much over the years and I believe it has gotten better every year. I am a sister of Alpha XI Delta, I went greek in fall 2011 and it has changed my life so much! For the better, of course. Greek life offers so many new opportunities for students and gets you involved in not only school functions but the surrounding counties.}",

Tips for prospective students Make sure you attend class everyday. Have a personal relationship with your advisor - they are there to help you. Use the library, they have great resources for you and the people who work there can help you. Use the writing center, they will help you with your papers. Bang for the buck The cost to attend is reasonable and the quality of the school is amazing for the low costs. The convenience of food is good and the quality.
