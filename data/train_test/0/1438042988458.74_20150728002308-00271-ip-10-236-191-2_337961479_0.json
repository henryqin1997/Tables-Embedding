The Waldorf was the hotel of New York in years gone by however the price we paid reflected that this is no longer the case. The room we had was in need of modernisation / upgrading however I felt the price paid was a fair reflection of that fact and given that we spent a minimal amount of time in the room it was not an issue. Overall an excellent stay - our room (1787) had a view of the Chrysler building which was an added bonus., 86986=July 31, 2015, 108540=July 27, 2015, 94153=July 29, 2015, 97605=July 28, 2015, 88771=July 30, 2015}",
