In connection with the present invention, the expressions \"proximal\" and \"distal\" are used from the viewpoint of the examiner, that is to say a proximal part of an embodiment according to the invention is, during catheterization, nearer to the examiner than a distal part. The catheter according to the invention enables central veins to be catheterized rapidly and with few complications via peripheral vein approach. A further advantage is that the catheter can be supplied in a kit or package which allows it to be used without the hands of the examiner coming into direct contact with the catheter. The catheter according to the invention is supplied sterile, preferably together with a venipuncture cannula, in particular a vein cannula, the steel cannula of which is surrounded by a plastic cannula and the steel cannula of which can be removed after the vein has been punctured. As a common packaging, a so-called peel pack is preferred. The limited displaceability, according to the invention, which preferably corresponds approximately to the length of the curved distal end 4 of the guide wire 3, can be achieved by various methods having the same effect. For example, the catheter tube 1 and guide wire 3 are each connected to one of two concentric telescopic sleeves 12, 13, the displacement length",
