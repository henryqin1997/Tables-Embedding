There was no 'real' nudity but for a comedy it was pretty explicit, it fitted the storyline perfectly though and wasn't aimed at shocking the audience, rather at illustrating Andy's character, and it certainly did that. Nancy is diversifying her clientele and this doesn't go unnoticed. It seems her competitors\u00a0don't like her expanding her circle of clients. Andy really is a selfish spoilt child and needs to grow up. It's nice to finally see Shane with a friend, even if this friend has an odd mom who seems more interested in Andy ...moreless expatriot, Sep 21, 2007 By 8.4 Nancy's competitors start to notice her activities.",
