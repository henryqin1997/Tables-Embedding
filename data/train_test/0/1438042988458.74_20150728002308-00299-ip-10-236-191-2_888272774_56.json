            "Every month there are tons of different events and acitivities you can get involved with on campus, and there is a rare week that something isn't going on in the Marshall Student Center. There is movie night pretty frequently on the lawn or in the Oval theater, there are free classes to take at the gym to have a little fitness fun, and most sporting events are free to USF students.",
            "I believe I have eaten at every dining hall on campus and tried just about every restaurant, and the selection is pretty good. I think I have only had the same thing at a meal hall twice. The Champion's Choice is my personal favorite because of all the healthy options.",
            "I personally am a commuter student living in Brandon because I couldn't afford to dorm, but I have many friends who do live in dorms. The dorms are well monitored by floor specific RA's who always seem really nice when I go visit my friends. Everyone I know who lives in a dorm has made more friends and connected better with the school by living on campus.",
            "Some of my classes have been more challenging than others, but I have not walked away from a class able to say that I didn't learn anything. All of my professors have been knowledgeable and even if the content is more simple, I still learn a great deal.",
            "The first semester is always the hardest because it is a huge adjustment; don't give up! Failing one assignment just means you need to try harder, not that you aren't cut out for college. If you don't make friends right away, be patient because you will by the time your first year is over.",
            "The campus is clean and beautiful; enjoyable to walk or bike around. My academic experiences so far have been great; I have found a few favorite professors. Making friends has been really easy because of all the events and activities USF plans."

This along with federal aid will really diminish the need for loans!, 529412=Humans versus Zombies is a staple of the campus in October for Halloween. It's a week long, campus-wide, game of tag essentially. It happens once every semester and is one of the most fun events I've ever participated in/watched!, 750471=There's a really cool sundial type thing with a meteorite in the middle of it, and on the summer solstice at 1:12 pm the circle above casts a shadow perfectly onto the circle in the center., 1116083=Food in the Argos, Andros, and Juniper/Poplar areas have ok food. Their food changes all the time but has sections that are always constant like sandwiches and pizza. The Marshall student center has a subway, panda express, chick-fil-a, and an organic section. After spring break of 2013 a pollo tropical is going to be on campus., 532688=The classes are consistent with whatever level you sign up for (1000 to 4000). Even if the course material is difficult, the professors are VERY accessible, as well as are the free tutor services and learning centers., 579975=The bathrooms are all cleaned regularly, the Juniper-Poplar Hall was just built in 2009, and there are always constant get togethers and fun activities on each floor., 176636=Apply early and be persistent. USF has not traditionally turned applicants away but this has changed over the past few years. Not everyone gets accepted anymore. Entrance requirements like GPA and SAT are really important so take the time to earn a high GPA and study for the SAT. Also, the university offers millions of dollars in scholarships to new students but you have to apply for them several months before the school year starts. Start looking into scholarships as early as October of the year before because their deadlines are often in the spring and long before the school year begins. Make some friends who are already at the university since they can give you specific tips on who to go to if you have an issue during the application process. It's easy to get lost in a big state university system so be diligent and take everything seriously. You'll have plenty of fun once you're accepted.}",

Students who love having fun just as much as learning. Students who are open to try new things. Tips for prospective students Get involved ASAP. The sooner you get involved, the easier it is. Try new things and be open minded. Oh yea, study hard and make your classes top priority. Enjoy this time in your life. You get back as much as you put in. Bang for the buck Tuition is going up, and USF recognizes that. The fees included in tuition do not begin to cover what you can receive from this school. There are SO many free things around campus. If you pay attention, you can usually find free food\u2026daily. There are so many activities and events that are free to you just for being a proud BULL! Things such as awesome concerts, shows,",
