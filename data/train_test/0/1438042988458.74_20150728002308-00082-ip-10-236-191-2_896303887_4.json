I researched my options carefully and found Bellingham Technical College to be well aligned with local industry. In just my first two quarters I have learned so much about my new field of industrial processes, especially petroleum refining and electric power generation., 37306=My quarterly tuition is about 2500. Equipment runs about another 500 depending on what you already have, but they tell you it's 2k. I'm learning an incredible amount in an insanely short time, and it beats the crap out of 4-year schools and $80k in debt. Downside is the communication between the school and incoming students is abysmal. I spent my summer haranguing them for information that should've been provided to new students when they registered and finally got the equipment list they told me would run about $2000 less than a week before term started. They cut a lot of the fat and stick to practical application classes, but be prepared for inordinate amounts of frustration while you're getting registered., 1181=Tuition and books are expensive, but relative to other community colleges, BTC is not out of line. Prices may vary widely between different classes and programs, but my full time schedule runs roughly $1300 per quarter for tuition and $310 per quarter for books., 43073=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
