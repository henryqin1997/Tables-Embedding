            "There are a ton of campus activities: fin fest, honors summit, plays, concerts, movie theatre, sporting events, sororities, frats, RHA activities, school wide humans vs zombies, res life trips and more. Theres also a pool and gym, nature trail, and river dock. There really is a ton of things to do on campus and you'll find them if you just look at bulletin boards.",
            "The food on campus is pretty good. And they have a lot of options which is really nice. If you're going to JU and you're trying to pick a meal plan definitely go for the eat anywhere option. And I was able to survive off 12 meals a week but it's up to your discretion.",
            "It really depends on who is also on your hall as to what kind of experience you'll have. There were incidences Of vandalism on my hall and they were very loud but I moved to a quieter hall where there wasnt vandalism. Most of the halls were pretty tame which makes for a good study environment and such.",
            "All of the teachers expect students to rise to specific standards and really put forth their best effort. The classes aren't necessarily easy but there is plenty of opportunity to make an A, what with teachers being available because of small classes and they being more flexible with work being turned in. Most of my teachers offered some form if extra credit also to help give students an extra boost.",
            "Jacksonville university is a great school for students who are looking for smaller campuses. The teachers and staff are all very helpful. They have an amazing, beautiful campus and there are plenty of opportunities to get out and do school activities and be involved."
