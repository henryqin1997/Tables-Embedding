Paolo Di Canio threw Conor Wickham on to give Sunderland more attacking options and Altidore burst through two tackles into the box but his weak shot was gathered easily by Stockdale. Defending bravely, Fulham put men behind the ball in an effort to defend the lead as the game entered the final five minutes and Ji\u2019s header flashed just wide to sighs of relief from the away support.",
