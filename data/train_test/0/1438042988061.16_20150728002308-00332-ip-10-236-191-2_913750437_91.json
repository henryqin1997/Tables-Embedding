            "Public safety is patrolling the campus 24/7. If it is late at night you can call P-safe from a lighted blue phone, scattered randomly throughout campus, for a safe ride back to your dorm.",
            "The students who choose to be a part of Greek life are actively volunteering and conducting events for charities. The students who choose to become affiliated have a rigorous schedule. The partying depicted in movies is overly exaggerated. Students do amazing work for wonderful causes. Frats may conduct car washes to raise money for a mission trip to Africa, or sororities will hand paint shirts and hang them in the center of campus to raise awareness about domestic violence.",
            "Any type of club or activity imaginable is possible here. There are required cultural credits you must earn before you are able to graduate. These events are incredibly frequent and most often optional to attend. The culture events are anything or any topic you could think of.",
            "Students who are motivated and passionate about becoming successful and well-rounded individuals. Students who are looking to just get a degree quickly and easily, I do not recommend Stetson.",
            "Stetson is incredibly expensive, but they offer amazing scholarships. For students, like me, who are also employed full-time, professors are remarkably understanding! The campus is is so well kept its hard not to appreciate it. Plus, it really is a great curriculum, with many perks, such as a large gym, ping pong tables, and a pool.",
            "Go outside! There is always* something happening. Whether students are relaxing in hammocks by the fountain in the center of campus, or playing volleyball in the sand court, or attending cultural credit events, students are always interacting.",
            "Meal plans are required for new students. Meal plans are unlimited, 19, 15, or 10 a week, and monitered by your Hatter Card. The commons is a huge cafeteria with many different options; gluten free, salad bar, mexican, pizza, etc. The hours are pretty typical, 7am-7:30pm. There is also an Einstein's Bagel and Hat Rack, where your meal swipe or Hatter bucks are accepted. The Starbuck's stays open until 2:30am and provides a large and comfortable study area that feels like a living room.",
            "The dorms are all pretty similar. There are typical dorms, as well as on and off campus apartments for upperclassmen. The resident assistants are always available and friendly! The residents in the dorm have become my family. The RAs do an amazing job at getting everyone together whether by having xbox nights in the common living area, or barbeques outside on the gorgeous sunny weekend days. The dorms are not as small as I thought and my roommate has become my best-friend.",
            "Hands down this is the most rigorous academics I have encountered, but it is definitely worth it. Nothing great comes easily, so if you are considering Stetson, know you will earn your degree by the amount of effort you put in.",
            "Do not let the confusion of admission and requirements stress you out! Help from current students and administration is only a text or phone call away. The process is so smooth if you just ask for help!",
            "Professors at Stetson are hands down the most amicable and intelligent teachers to date. The campus is always vibrant and clean. Easily, the best college I could have selected."

I know I would love that extra help that Stetson students receive, and it would help in giving me a better learning experience., 480993=Values Day, in September, everyone gets the day off of school to participate in community service. The library gives out milk and cookies during finals week., 508306=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 54839=with student to teacher 11:1 i say you can definitely learn a lot..and the professors are very open., 496032=The Rock is a pile of rocks Stetson paid $30,000 for in the fall of 2014 and has since become a location for students to share their views on the campus and the world. DeLand is affectionately known as the skydive capital of the world and Skydive Deland offers discounts to seniors during Senior Week. On a clear day on campus, you can see people skydiving., 456840=It's a great hands on college where you can connect with other students who have the same interests as you. the classes are a great size with a ration of a bout 1:11 so you can get that extra help and teachers know who you are. The campus is beautiful and serene, you can easily find a nice quiet place to spend your time studying or just to get away., 332915=It's not the best, but we have good coffee. When outside people visit, the food is better. Also, we are completely redoing our food services for the Fall of 2013 so who knows what it will be like}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here The biggest complaint that students have about Stetson, and DeLand in general, is that it is too quiet on the weekends. If you are really big into drinking and partying, Stetson may not be the school for you. However, I have always found that Stetson has plenty to offer for me. Every Friday night, the CSA puts on fun activities, there is always some place on campus to find free food, and it is easy to keep oneself busy with all the concerts, organizations, and sports teams on campus. As an added bonus, Stetson is about halfway between Orlando and Daytona Beach and it is not a long drive to either one. Am learning a lot Stetson has a teacher to student ratio of 11 to 1. That being the case, a remarkable amount of attention is given to each student, especially if they seek extra help themselves. Classes are challenging, but not impossible. There are also plenty of guest speakers that the school brings onto campus for lectures and presentations.
