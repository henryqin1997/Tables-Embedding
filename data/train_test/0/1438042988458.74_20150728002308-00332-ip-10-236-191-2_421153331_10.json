It's still \"Synchronization\" at 74% and yes it's been 20 hours so it sounds like it will not be done to late late tonight. The app I do the hard drive test speed with is Black magic design Disk Speed Test. It's on the app store for a free install. I end up doing RAID 5 with 1\u00a0spar\u00a0drive now as well. No clue why this dumb Synchronization is\u00a0taking\u00a0so freaking long. If I know this I might have not gotten this device.",
