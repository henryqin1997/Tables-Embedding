            "Great for students who like small classes who like one-on-one time with their professors. Great athletic department, and good connections to local businesses and locations for class trips and internships.",
            "Make sure you keep up with your schoolwork, because the professors will make sure you have something to do most of time. Study, study, STUDY!!! Get to know your fellow students and faculty very well; this is a community-oriented campus, and it will only help to spend time with them.",
            "As great a campus as this is, the price is about average; not cheap, but not sky-high like the popular universities like Clemson or USC.",
            "The faculty are always nice and willing to help out. The cultural impact is awesome; there are always sporting events to see or fun activities to take part in, as well as community projects to help give back.",
            "The teachers at AU not only challenge you intellectually, but they are always willing to help you outside of class whenever you need it."

During chapel time, there is a time of singing and different speakers who come throughout the year. We are required to attend eight chapels per semester. However, we have speakers and organizations that come that are truly a joy to hear from., 188102=The new girl dorms, the Boulevards, are wonderful. They have community bathrooms and they're great. I was really skeptical of having community bathrooms but it's great once you get used to it. It has a 3:1 girls to bathroom ratio compared to the older girls dorms (Denmark and Pratt) that have a 6:1 bathroom ratio. If you're a guy then you aren't in the best of luck because the guys dorms are not as nice as the girls unless you pay extra to live in your own room in the Village., 361544=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 150005=It is a university of around 2500 students but is 100 years old.}",
