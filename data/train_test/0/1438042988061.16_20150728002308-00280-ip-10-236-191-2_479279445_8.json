    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{26308=The powder blends employed as starting mixtures for tool substrates of this invention are densified to a density of at least 98% of theoretical by pressing followed by sintering, hot-pressing, gas over-pressure sintering, or hot isostatic pressing in a non-oxidizing atmosphere. Temperatures employed for pressing followed by sintering range from about 1600\ufffd C. to about 1800\ufffd C., preferably from about 1700\ufffd C. to about 1800\ufffd C. Hot-pressing is carried out at pressures greater than about 2000 psig (13,790 kN/M2) at temperatures ranging from about 1600\ufffd C. to about 1900\ufffd C., preferably from about 1700\ufffd C. to about 1900\ufffd C. Gas over-pressure sintering is carried out at pressures from about 150 to about 200 psig (about 1030 to about 1380 kN/M2) and at temperatures ranging from about 1600\ufffd C. to about 1950\ufffd C., preferably from about 1700\ufffd C. to about 1950\ufffd C. Hot isostatic pressing is carried out at pressures ranging above 10,000 psig (68,947 kN/M2) and at temperatures ranging from 1600\ufffd C. to about 1900\ufffd C., preferably from about 1700\ufffd C. to about 1800\ufffd C. Sintering is carried out without pressure at temperatures ranging between about 1400\ufffd C. and about 1700\ufffd C. for at least one hour, and preferably at temperatures between about 1600\ufffd C. and 1700\ufffd C. for about 1.5 to about 5 hours. Sintering is preferably carried out in a non-reactive atmosphere to prevent formation of undesirable oxide or oxynitride phases., 14781=This application contains subject matter related to matter disclosed and claimed in copending patent application, Ser. No. 128,070 filed Mar. 7, 1980 now abandoned entitled \"Abrasion Resistant Silicon Nitride Based Articles\" and in the following copending applications filed May 20, 1982 concurrently herewith, all assigned to the assignee of the present application:, 18283=Economic pressures for higher productivity in machining applications are placing increasing demands upon the performance of cutting tool materials. To achieve high productivity in machining, a tool must be able to cut at high speeds. At cutting speeds exceeding 1500 surface feet per minute (sfpm), the high temperature strength and chemical inertness of a cutting tool material become more and more important. The usefulness of cemented carbide cutting tool materials (the predominant material used in cutting tools today) has been extended to applications requiring cutting speeds of about 1500 sfpm by coating such tools with aluminum oxide. For cutting speeds in excess of 1500 sfpm, cemented carbide tools encounter problems associated with loss of strength and tool nose deformation, which affect dimensional tolerance in the workpiece and contribute to shorter tool life., 28160=A 68 gram batch of silicon nitride powder containing 5 weight percent magnesium oxide sintering additive was mixed with 159.8 grams of toluene, 5.44 grams of methanol and 2.04 grams of magnesium stearate. The batch was thoroughly mixed by milling in a two quart polyethylene jar with about 2000 grams of milling medium for 1/2 hour. The resulting slurry was dried at about 105\ufffd C. and the dry batch was dry ball milled in a polyethylene jar for 24 hours. To this dry ball milled batch were added 2.04 grams of Carbowax, 68 grams of toluene, and 2.04 grams of methanol. The resulting mixture was milled for fifteen minutes and the resulting slurry was dried at about 105\ufffd C. The dried powder mixture was screened through a 60 mesh screen and the -60 mesh fraction was pressed at about 25,000 psig to obtain a green powder compact.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While there have been described what are at present believed to be the preferred embodiments of the present invention, it will be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art that various changes and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. carbon monoxide is optionally added to the gas mixture passed over the heated substrate bodies in order the establish the desired equilibrium gas composition. The following example illustrates the preparation of alumina coated composite silicon nitride cutting tool inserts by this latter method. 2AlCl3 +3CO2 +3H2 =Al2 O3 +3CO+6HCl; In another, preferred method of coating the silicon nitride substrate bodies with one or more adherent alumina coating layers, aluminum chloride is reacted with carbon dioxide in the presence of hydrogen gas according to the folowing equation: The substrate piece or pieces are heated to a temperature between about 800\ufffd C. to about 1500\ufffd C. gaseous mixture is passed over the heated substrate until the desired coating thickness is achieved. Routine experimentation is used to determines the rate of coating thickness growth at a particular gaseous flow rate and temperature. 2AlCl3 +3H2 O=Al2 O3 +6HCl The substrate bodies produced by the methods detailed above are coated with aluminum oxide by chemical vapor deposition techniques or physical vapor deposition techniques known in the art.
