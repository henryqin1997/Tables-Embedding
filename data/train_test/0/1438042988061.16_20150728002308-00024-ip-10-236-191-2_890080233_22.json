The student teacher ratio is 1:30., 57832=southeastern is an accredited university with over 90 degree programs. the largest teacher-student ratio is less than 1 : 100. the ratio reaches it's maximum mainly in entry level courses that are required for all students. selu offers numerous scholarships to qualifying students, while tuition/fees are relatively reasonable. nearby universities (such as lsu) with the same level of accreditation offer a staggeringly higher teacher-student ratio, approaching levels of 1 : 1000, which severely limits the chances of receiving one-on-one attention from one's course instructor. selu offers multiple scholarships for every one that can definitely be attained by the average student, whereas lsu offers scholarships mainly only to the highest-ranking students. essentially, southeastern offers more opportunities, less rigorous course work, and a smaller cost of attendance than all neighboring universities with equivalent levels of accreditation. southeastern defines the phrase bang for the buck., 336413=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 316761=Follow deadlines, they will sneak up on you and if you miss it; too late! 8:00 A.M classes aren't that bad.
