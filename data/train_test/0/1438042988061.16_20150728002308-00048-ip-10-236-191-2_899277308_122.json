            "Most of the time, Cal Baptist is fully safe. At other times, there's robberies and car thefts.",
            "Cal Baptist has no Greek Life.",
            "There are great clubs and activities at Cal Baptist, but sadly, not that much ... but no worries, Cal Baptist significantly grows every year.",
            "Cal Baptist is great for those wanting to study something Big, Christian Studies, Philosophy, and Applied Theology, or double major. Also consider Cal Baptist for it's Architecture program (the Dean of the Architecture school happens to be trustworthy and respectable).",
            "Cal Baptist has too many unique traditions. However, I'd like to point out that Cal Baptist does have private, picturesque locations on campus. To use them, all you have to do is find them.",
            "Despite it's hefty price tag, I've only have had to pay 1200 out of my own pocket. I feel like I'm paying for Cal State tuition. :) Which is a plus. However, make sure you're able to pay for 2/3 of the tuition. If you end up having to pay for more than $10,000 through your own pocket, and loans, do not attend Cal Baptist. You'd be better attending another college or university. Also, only take out Federal Subsidized loans (and not even a single unsubsidized loan). Private loans will haunt you if you take them out. Believe the horror stories you read about those taking out private loans.",
            "For fun you could attend campus events by both students and faculty, join or start clubs, participate in Bible study groups, etc. However, Cal Baptist is unique in that it happens to host some interesting events through the year. For this part, you'll have to ask students yourself.",
            "Although I don't have a meal plan, I've eaten in the cafeteria before: the food is amazing. Cal Baptist also happens to host other eating areas: Subway, Wandas, and Briscos. All the which happen to serve excellent food.",
            "Irrelevant to me as I happen to be a commuter. However, from observing students who live on campus, the majority of them seem happy. My advice to incoming freshman is to live in the cottages their first year.",
            "The work at Cal Baptist is both challenging and manageable. Assigned readings and essays will comprise the majority of your work. However, if you explore school's academics more than the average student, you'll find something exciting to work on.",
            "Get to know the Faculty and Professors at Cal Baptist. They want to know you not only as their student but as your friend. At Cal Baptist you'll be required to take (3) Christian Studies courses. The school advises that you take Old & New Testament Survey before taking your last required Christian Studies course. I say you should instead take the lower division requirements for the Christian Studies Major (only 4 courses). This way you not only study the Bible, but you study it properly, and more in depth. Although a meal plan isn't required for commuters, get one anyways, even if it's the smallest meal plan. Remain Undeclared for your Freshman year. Use your freshman year to not only finish your general education requirements, but to explore the school academically. Take advantage of the events hosted at Cal Baptist. They're all unique and worth attending at least once. If you're a commuter, don't go home right after classes for your first month at Cal Baptist. It's important that you have a strong beginning at Cal Baptist, or for any college or university for that matter. It's not necessary to find your true love your freshman year, or enter the college experience just yet. Use your freshman year to understand the new environment you're entering as opposed to just conforming to expectations. If you plan on studying Engineering, Music, Architecture, or Nursing, then just study one of them. If you're studying anything else, double major or pick up an minor. A diverse study is not good for yourself, but possibly impressive to future employers. I would like to give you more tips, but I've blown up my page as it is haha",
            "California Baptist University is a great university for those wanting to study in a spiritually driven environment as opposed to a secular one. The goal of a Christian University is to help its students develop a clear identity of their intellect and spirituality as opposed to a new identity. So take my rating seriously when I say California Baptist University is not only progressing academically but is respected for its School of Christian Ministries to develop the identity and minds of its students."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{129352=the classes here are great. they the teacher to student ratio is about 1:21 but it is actually a lot smaller if i might add. i had one class with only 6 students! and trust me that is awesome. it might depend on the major you are also, but so far i have had only one class that was somewhat large and that was a general education class that is popular on campus, it is called marine science., 198016=Best college cafeteria food ever. Sunday brunch is to die for. People actually come from off campus to eat in out cafeteria. There is also a restaurant called Briscios that offers sandwiches, and salads. There is a new restaurant opening fall 2012 that is going to offer different types of pasta. All of these are options that use the meal plan., 94607=The facilities, classes, professors, food, student body, and the school itself are all fantastic. There are buildings that are still standing from when the school was founded in 1954, but they are all standing strong, and are diligently maintained. In addition to buildings that were there originally, California Baptist University has purchased much of the land around it, and continues making renovations on existing buildings, as well as recently built facilities, and buildings that are being constructed., 463048=On campus, one can visit the game room and play ping pong, pool, shuffleboard, or Foosball. There is also a recreational center being built which will have workout equipment, a pool, an above ground track, a rock climbing wall, and much more. This is projected to open in the spring of 2013., 39258=Woo fest, March Madness and the Man Auction are all great traditions and so much fun to participate in!, 246543=The CBU crazies march during homecoming, there are several cool spots too! For example, there is the fortuna fountain, the catacombs( unfortunately you cannot go down in them) and the front lawn in general is nice., 658978=There are many events on campus for the residence and commuter students. If any events are coming up there will be posters around campus, people will tell you during Chapel, your RA will post things in the living area and you can check lancermail to see what is going on. There are service events to help out the community and hang out with friends. During September we have TWIRP week were the girl ask the boys on dates the entire week. Also have midnight madness, christmas chapel and etc. Next semester we have WOO! same as TWIRP but instead the boys ask the girls and woo there affection. Just a munch of events to connects everybody together and meet new people., 25803=There are tons of fun things to do on campus at any given moment. I enjoy spending my free time playing Futsol(street soccer) with friends or having late night jam sessions with my band, or even just kicking back and watching a movie at amc with a 7$ ticket bought from campus life. Oh and did i mention that the mountians and beach are only 45 min away? Wooo! 4:1 ratio!, 322308=A very friendly environment. The staff as been awesome in helping me along the way for the 2012-2013 school year. I'm so excited for what the future has for me at cbu., 533345=Despite it's hefty price tag, I've only have had to pay 1200 out of my own pocket. I feel like I'm paying for Cal State tuition. :) Which is a plus. However, make sure you're able to pay for 2/3 of the tuition.

Believe the horror stories you read about those taking out private loans., 255431=They do TONS of free and fun stuff. On November 1st to kick off Homecoming they were able to get Switchfoot to come and gave out like 600 FREE TICKETS!!! AND!! The concert was in our very own gym! And for midnight madness instead of just regular tickets they gave out CBU watches., 23013=No frats sorry, but tons of great clubs! Baking club for example............4:1 ratio!, 734003=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Be prepared to study, write papers, and read more than you ever have before. Throughout my previous years in school I maintained a high grade point average, but I still have to work very hard to maintain such a high GPA in college. Do your best to get involved in at least one sport, club, or bible study group. The friendships, memories, and values you'll gain are life-changing and it will make you feel home away from home. Bang for the buck I will admit that CBU is very expensive, but so is every other private university. The christian environment, caring professors, and lifelong friendships you'll make guarantee that the high cost of enrolling at CBU is truly worth every penny! Am enjoying being here I am still amazed everyday at how much of a blessing it is to be attending CBU and to be able to live on campus. The faculty is so friendly and helpful. Even my professors truly care about my grade and they strive for me to succeed. The professors really care about you as a person and they are available to help with school or even things that aren't school-related. I love my school and I can't imagine being anywhere else! Am",
