See, e.g., FIGS. 7D, 7E, and 7F, which illustrate and specify load transfer portions of exemplary urethral sling implants. Additional examples of slings that include a central support portion and load-transfer portions are illustrated at Assignee's U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/346,750, entitled \u201cTRANSOBTURATOR SURGICAL ARTICLES AND METHODS,\u201d filed Feb. 3, 2006, and incorporated herein by reference. The load-transfer portion exhibits a width that is greater than a width of an end portion, such as the width of the end portion at the location at which the end portion connects to the load-transfer portion. The load-transfer portion also includes a width that is less than the width of a widened central support portion. Functionally, the load-transfer portion allows a load placed across the central support portion, between the end portions, to be distributed across a width of the central support portion that is greater than widths of the end portions.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{121179=An implant such as a urethral sling can be installed as described herein with the assistance of surgical equipment, instruments, or tools that will be understood to be of assistance in performing the present surgical methods. Examples of surgical tools that may be useful include tools of the type described herein and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,911,003 and U.S. Published Application No. 2003/0171644A1, which generally include right and left-handed opposing helical installation tools., 51289=\u201cTransobturator\u201d methods generally involve two lateral incisions at the left and right inner thigh regions, each near a patient's obturator foramen, and a third, medial external incision at the perineum or vagina. The implant is installed between the medial incision and the two lateral incisions with a central support portion of the sling being placed to support pelvic tissue such as the urethra. For treating incontinence, the implant supports the urethra, optionally by not necessarily by directly contacting the urethra. By some methods a central support portion can contact tissue below the urethra that supports the urethra, such as the corpus spongiosum. The implant may be tensioned to approximate pelvic tissue, e.g., to improve continence. See Assignee's copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/347,047, entitled \u201cTRANSOBTURATOR METHODS FOR INSTALLING SLING TO TREAT INCONTINENCE, AND RELATED DEVICES,\u201d filed Feb. 3, 2006, and incorporated herein by reference., 44286=New methods are being developed for improving safety and efficacy of these implants and methods of installation. Recent developments have led to methods of implantation that use a transobturator tissue path. See, for example, Assignee's copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/064,875, filed Feb. 24, 2005, by Anderson et al., and titled Transobturator Surgical Articles and Methods. The use of a tissue path that traverses the obturator foramen calls for new features of surgical implants and systems that allow ease of installation and good efficacy and functioning of an implant during chronic implantation., 119644=To improve continence, the sling can be placed to support the urethra, by directly contacting the urethra or by indirectly supporting the urethra by contacting tissue supportive of the urethra, such as the corpus spongiosum (CS) or bulbous cavernosum (BC) muscle. See, Assignee's copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/347,047, entitled \u201cTRANSOBTURATOR METHODS FOR INSTALLING SLING TO TREAT INCONTINENCE, AND RELATED DEVICES,\u201d filed Feb. 3, 2006, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference., 72834=Different components of exemplary implants, e.g., support portion, central support portion, end portions, tensioning members (e.g., sutures), etc., can be formed separately and assembled by methods such as those described in pending patent application having U.S. Ser. No. 11/115,655, filed on Apr. 26, 2005, entitled \u201cSURGICAL IMPLANTS AND RELATED METHODS,\u201d the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference., 82208=Reinforcement of an implant, such as an end portion of an implant, can be accomplished by methods described in Assignee's copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/347,063, entitled \u201cPELVIC IMPLANTS AND RELATED METHODS,\u201d filed Feb. 3, 2006, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. According to embodiments of implants described therein, an end portion may be heat treated or \u201cheat sealed\u201d along edges to produce reinforced edge extensions that improve friction between tissue and implant. Stiffened or reinforced edge extensions result in edges of an end portion digging into tissue without deforming. Other embodiments include edge extension reinforcement by use of adhesives, coatings, or added stiffening materials placed at or adjacent to edge extensions., 54259=End portions connected to and extending from a central support portion can be useful to attach to other anatomical features to provide further support for the central support portion and the supported pelvic tissue. Multiple (e.g., two or four) end portions can extend from the central support portion as elongate \u201cends,\u201d \u201carms,\u201d or \u201cextensions,\u201d that are used to attach to other anatomy, such as by extending through a tissue path to an external incision or to an internal anchoring point. See, e.g., US patent publication number 2005/0080317, having U.S. Ser. No. 10/684,861, filed Oct. 14, 2003, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference., 59382=Exemplary urethral sling implants for use in transobturator methods, e.g., for treating incontinence in males, can include a central support portion that exhibits a width that is greater than a width of the end portions, e.g., the width of the end portion at a location that is adjacent to the load-transfer portion. See Assignee's U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/346,750, entitled \u201cTRANSOBTURATOR SURGICAL ARTICLES AND METHODS,\u201d filed Feb. 3, 2006, and incorporated herein by reference. A central support portion that has a width that is greater than a width of the end portions can improve contact between the implant and tissue to be supported by the implant, e.g., the urethra, corpus spongiosum, etc. An increased width of a central support portion may take the form of one or two lateral extensions that extends (i.e., increases) the width of the central support portion in at least one direction (an anterior direction) for contacting tissue that is relatively anterior to a patient's anatomy compared to an otherwise similar central support portion that exhibits a smaller width. Alternately, a central support portion may include two lateral extensions in each of an anterior lateral direction and a posterior lateral direction, to contact tissue that is both anterior and posterior to a central support portion of a relatively more narrow width., 74180=End portions of an implant of a porous material include side edges (\u201cedges\u201d) and edge extensions. The edge extensions exist due to the porous or \u201copen pore\u201d nature of the material used to prepare the end portion. The edge extensions can be treated or reinforced to cause the end portion to resist movement within tissue, during implantation, after implantation, or both. Reinforced edge extensions provide increased frictional resistance of an end portion from movement within the tissue, which provides desired short-term fixation properties of end portions within tissue during and immediately after installation, i.e., the ability of the end portions to stick and hold into flesh when installed without moving and potentially without stretching. See Assignee's U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/347,063, entitled \u201cPELVIC IMPLANTS AND RELATED METHODS,\u201d filed Feb. 3, 2006, and incorporated herein by reference., 79864=An end portion of an implant can optionally include a tensioning member or other reinforcement that can reduce length-wise elasticity of an end portion. As described in Assignee's copending U.S. Patent application 2005/0143618 (U.S. Ser. No. 11/064,875) entitled \u201cTransobturator Surgical Articles and Methods,\u201d the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference, an end portion may include a relatively inelastic tensioning filament, suture, or other reinforcement, along lengths of end portions. A tensioning suture may be constructed from a permanent or absorbable material., 42438=The present non-provisional patent Application claims benefit from U.S. Provisional Patent Applications having U.S. Ser. No. 60/650,208, filed on Feb. 4, 2005, by Arnal et al., and titled TRANSOBTURATOR SLING FOR MEN; U.S. Ser. No. 60/650,209, filed on Feb. 4, 2005, by Arnal et al., titled TRANSOBTURATOR SLING FOR MEN; U.S. Ser.

No. 60/650,207, filed on Feb. 4, 2005, by Rehder et al., titled TRANSOBTURATOR SLING FOR MEN, wherein the entirety of said provisional patent applications are incorporated herein by reference., 54949=As a specific example of a urethral sling, a urethral sling may include a widened central support portion to provide increased area of contact between the central support portion of the sling and the tissue being supported, preferably and optionally in combination with a load transfer portion between end portions and the central support portion. See Assignee's U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/346,750, entitled \u201cTRANS OBTURATOR SURGICAL ARTICLES AND METHODS,\u201d filed Feb. 3, 2006, and incorporated herein by reference.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention has been described in terms of particular embodiments and applications, one of ordinary skill, in light of this teaching, can generate additional embodiments and modifications without departing from the spirit of or exceeding the scope of the claimed invention. Accordingly, it is to be understood that the drawings and descriptions herein are proffered by way of example to facilitate comprehension of the invention and should not be construed to limit the scope thereof. , for example, illustrates an example of a tool that has a handle with a non-conventional grip. Tool 270 includes needle 274 and handle 272. Handle 272 includes a grip 276, that is oriented along an axis different from needle shaft 274. This arrangement may allow a desirable orientation of the handle for use during a transobturator procedure. FIG. 13 Other modifications may also be useful for a tool, especially for use in an transobturator installation procedure in the male anatomy. Passing a needle in a male anatomy may on average be more difficult than in a female anatomy due to on-average greater muscle mass to pass through the obturator foramen, and due to the need to pass the needle through the perineal membrane versus a vaginal incision as in a woman. To assist in needle passage in the male anatomy, dimensions of size and shape of a three-dimensional portion of a needle may be increased",
