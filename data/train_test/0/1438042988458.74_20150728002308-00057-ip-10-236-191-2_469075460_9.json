    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{22866=The invention provides a process for preparing fibril aggregates in which the texture of the aggregate is controlled by the choice of catalyst support. Using supports having one or more readily cleavable planar surfaces produces fibril aggregates having the appearance of combed yarn in which the individual fibrils are straight to slightly bent or kinked. Aggregates having loose, open mat textures in which the individual fibrils are straight to slightly bent or kinked may also be produced. These aggregates are readily dispersed, making them useful in composite fabrication where uniform properties throughout the structure are desired. The substantial linearity of the individual fibril strands also makes the aggregates useful in EMI shielding and electrical applications, e.g., the devices described in Friend et al., U.S. Ser.

Similarly, at least 90% (and, more preferably, substantially all) of the individual fibrils in the aggregate have a length to diameter ratio of at least 5.

No. 07/413,837, filed Sep. 28, 1989, now abandoned., 18212=In a first aspect, the invention features a fibril aggregate that includes a multiplicity of carbon fibrils whose longitudinal axes have substantially the same relative orientation, each of the fibrils characterized as having graphitic layers that are substantially parallel to its longitudinal axis and being free of a continuous thermal carbon overcoat (i.e. pyrolytically deposited carbon resulting from thermal cracking of the gas feed used to prepare the fibrils). One aspect of substantial parallelism is that the projection of the graphitic layers on the fibril's longitudinal axis extends for a relatively long distance in terms of the external diameter of the fibril (e.g., at least two fibril diameters, preferably at least five diameters), as described in Snyder et al., U.S. Ser.

Other embodiments are within the following claims. Fibrils were grown using the procedure described in Example 1. Typical fibril yields were 20-25 times based on catalyst, 120-150 times based on iron. Examination by electron microscopy (SEM and STEM) showed that the fibrils were present primarily as loose, open mats with lesser amounts of combed yarn aggregates. After addition was complete, the slurry was filtered; the supernatant was colorless (pH=about 5) and the solids were a dark red-brown. After washing several times with deionized water, the solids were dried overnight at 160\ufffd C. under reduced pressure (15-20 in. mercury vacuum). A typical yield of dried solids was 105 gm. The solids were then calcined at 400\ufffd C. for 4 hrs. to yield 74 gm catalyst. Iron and molybdenum loadings were calculated to be 20.8% and 4.0%, respectively. 74 gm magnesia platelets (Alfa Inorganics) was slurried with 400 gm deionized water at 65\ufffd-70\ufffd C. for 1 hr. with rapid stirring in a baffled reactor. A solution of 112 gm Fe(NO3)3.9H2 O and 5.4 gm (NH4)6.Mo7 O24.4H2 O in 150 cm3 deionized water was added dropwise over a period of about 1 hr. at 65\ufffd C. while maintaining rapid stirring. During the addition, the solids turned chocolate brown. This example describes the preparation of open mat fibril aggregates. EXAMPLE 6",
