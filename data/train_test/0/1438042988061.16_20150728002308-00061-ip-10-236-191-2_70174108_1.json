The JumpStart program reads the rules from the first rule through the last. A match occurs when the system that is being installed matches all the system attributes that are defined in the rule. As soon as a system matches a rule, the JumpStart program stops reading the rules.ok file and begins to install the system, based on the matched rule's profile.

On the install server, create the custom JumpStart rules file. For detailed instructions about creating custom JumpStart files, refer to Chapter\u00a023, Preparing Custom JumpStart Installations (Tasks). On the install server, create the custom JumpStart profile file. For examples of Solaris Flash archive profiles, see Profile Examples.
