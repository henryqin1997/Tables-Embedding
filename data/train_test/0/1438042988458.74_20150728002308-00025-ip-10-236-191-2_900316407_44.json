            "The campus is very safe. If you have a late nigh class, do not worry. There is always security on campus to walk you to your car just in case you feel a bit uneasy. The location of the school is great too because it has a really low crime rate.",
            "The student rec. center always has new activities on the weekends. You do have to pay a minimal fee for those, but it is always fun. They go hiking in Yosemite, hang out by the beach in Santa Cruz. Trips are planned to just about anywhere within 2 hours.",
            "The food is great! I love it. When I have to stay on campus late, The Warrior Grill never fails me. The food there is great and moderately priced.",
            "The professors at this school know how much to challenge you. They teach what you need to learn and they are always really nice. The work load can get heavy at times, but it is the same at all schools.",
            "If you do not want to go to a big city, but still want to go to a great college, this is it. It is located in Turlock, CA. It is not a very big city but it is a nice little town. The campus is located near the heart of the town, so it works out great.",
            "This campus is very beautiful and full of water. The professors are great and the staff is amazing. This campus is not too big, but it is not small either."

Tips for prospective students Come check out the campus see it you like it. Once you've decided to come here make sure to get involved on campus it opens so many doors. If you can I highly advise doing Student Leadership Program during the summer you'll meet so many new people. Also make sure you go to as many events at school because all the events we put together it's for the students and you're paying for it through ur student fees so get your moneys worth by going. Bang for the buck Since the school is very small it's as if your paying the price of a public school but the quality of a private school. The school",
