We begin by providing an explanation of the terms.\u00a0 A citizen initiative is a means by which a petition signed by a certain minimum number of voters can require a public vote on a citizen proposed ordinance or charter amendment.\u00a0 A referendum is a means by which a petition signed by a certain minimum number of voters can require a public vote to repeal an ordinance enacted by the Council. Both initiative and referendum processes are sometimes called \u201ccitizen directed legislation.\u201d A recall is a procedure by which voters can remove an elected official from office through a direct vote before his or her term has ended.}",
