Seems strange, but it does have the effect that the vendors revert to the full price and then apply the discounts. At least with this one, the price got a little lower. When they did it before with the K20D, it raised prices for a while. Of coarse, once the rebate was over, the market adjusted and the price went way down, so we will just have to wait this one out as well.",
