Brookfield has opted for the final choice. The terms are pro-rated with caps on both the cash and stock consideration. Assuming the fully pro-rated mix, the spread Thursday was 7 cents, or 1.8%.

The request for additional information on the combination of the building products manufacturers follows a refiling for the antitrust review in October.
