            "280. Posted: Tue 10th May 2011 19:33 BST I'm up for a few games, just need to trade 3DS codes I think. Also, the amount of Hadoken spammers is retarded. Hadoken, Hadoken, Hadoken... I know you can avoid it, but putting up with it 60% of the time is just ridiculous. Then the guys who crouch and sit there punching and kicking, can't get anywhere near them, and if you jump over them they do Shoryuken. And I can't use Hadoken to stop them crouching because they just block it... the most annoying combo I've seen is: Hadoken, crouch, kick, punch, twirly feet, uppercut, throw and then Ryu's special uppercut move (forget name). I've nearly thrown my 3DS on the floor because of that, but instead I swear my house down. This game is amazing, but ruined by those blasted spammers/campers.
