Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined in the claims. It is to be understood that the foregoing is illustrative of the present invention and is not to be construed as limited to the specific embodiments disclosed, and that modifications to the disclosed embodiments, as well as other embodiments, are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims. The invention is defined by the following claims, with equivalents of the claims to be included therein. Communications cables according to embodiments of the invention in operation may reduce, and preferably minimize, cross-talk between the twisted pairs of insulated conductors. Moreover, communications cables according to embodiments of the invention may reduce, and preferably minimize, capacitance imbalance as desired for such cables. It will be understood that the various geometric shapes (e.g., sawtooth shaped, knob shaped etc.) of the wall portions of the embodiments of the present invention illustrated in FIGS. 1-8 may be combined. For example, the knob shaped cross-section illustrated in FIG. 6 may be combined with",
