Our ongoing development and maintenance of the killboard is supported by our ETC sales. Buy yours at BattleClinic Deep Space Supply! Short FAQ 1. I get the Please enter your API key, this mail cannot be posted directly error! If you get an error trying to manually post a killmail, please note: Super Capital ships, POS's, and kills that happened in FD-MLJ (system where PVP is allowed on the test server) require your full API. They cannot be manually posted. This is to improve killboard accuracy. 2. I'm on a killmail for a POS. Why can't I post it? Your CEO or a director, the enemy CEO or one of their directors, the person who laid the final blow, or the victim must have their full API in the killboard, for a POS to post. 3. I can't post a killmail because it says item \"unknown.\" Check that the killmail is valid, generated from ingame and not copied from a 3rd party. It could be that CCP have released a patch and have not yet released a static data export to allow fan sites to recognize new items. 4. My ranking history shows a dot. Why doesn't it track my whole history? The chart only tracks the movement of the top",
