Isaiah has indirect evidence linking him to his parents, based also on court records, specifically his appearance in court on indictment for perjury and the willingness of John Meadows, Thomas Meadows & Thomas M. Meadows to stand surety for his appearance in court at the next term. At least one commonly accepted child, John, may be the son of Thomas's brother Jason and a cousin of Thomas and Keziah's children. At least one other cousin may have migrated with Thomas and Keziah, Isham Meadows/Meadors son of Thomas's brother Lewis, as suggested by the Pension Application of his widow Frances Alsop Meadows Wallace. Another presumed son, Isham or Isom is sometimes omitted from the lists of Thomas and Keziah's children, or confused with his son, William Isom Meadows. Both father and son married Sarahs, and both eventually moved to Indiana, although the son Isom stayed in Whitley County much longer, marrying his first cousin",
