    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{34579=Recently, continuous wavelength tuning has been realized by using a two-section DBR laser, disclosed in H. Debr\ufffdgeas-Sillard, A. Vuong, F. Delorme, J. David, V. Allard, A. Bod\ufffdr\ufffd, O. LeGouezigou, F. Gaborit, J. Rofte, M. Goix, V. Voiriot and J. Jacquet, \u201cDBR module with 20-mW constant coupled output power over 16 nm (40\ufffd50GHz spaced channels)\u201d, IEEE Photon. Technol. Lett., vol. 13, pp. 4-6, 2001. The operation of the laser in a continuous wavelength tuning mode is achieved through a combination of adjusting the gain current injection, Bragg voltage and temperature of the laser. Although the process is relatively simple, mode hopping occurs when the device is operated at a fixed temperature and control of at least three parameters, including the temperature of the laser, is required to achieve continuous tuning of the wavelength., 38862=The reduction and smoothing of the refractive index discontinuity typically associated with the gain-Bragg section interface, can be achieved by creating the desired larger bandgap energy in the Bragg region, as compared to the gain region, via a process of quantum well intermixing (QWI), rather than using growth and regrowth techniques. QWI is a post-growth technique that allows tuning of the bandgap in localized sections of the device heterostructure. A good review of QWI has been written by J. H. Marsh in \u201cQuantum well intermixing\u201d, Semicond. Sci. Technol., vol. 8, pp. 1136-1155, 1993. By application of a QWI process to the Bragg section, the increase in bandgap energy can be achieved with minimal change to the refractive index profile. In addition, the waveguides in the Bragg and gain sections are inherently in close alignment as no regrowth phase is required., 26430=This application is a U.S. National filing under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd119 hereby claiming priority to GB Application No. 0124217.1 filed Oct. 9, 2001, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes., 47544=FIG. 4 shows the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) spectrum of the two-section DBR laser described above. The gain section length is 300 \u03bcm, while that of the Bragg section is 600 \u03bcm. Both end facets are taken to have a low reflectivity (2%) coating. By comparing the strength of the peak emission wavelength to the nearest side lobe, it can be seen that a large side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR), of above 30 dB, can be achieved with this structure. The dependence of the SMSR on the length of the Bragg section is shown in FIG. 5, indicating that a longer Bragg section leads to less unwanted feedback in the cavity and consequently a larger SMSR. However, the increase in SMSR saturates at around 35 dB as the length of the Bragg section is increased above 1000 \u03bcm. With such a long Bragg section, the amount of light reaching the rear facet, being reflected, and then propagating back through the distributed reflector is negligible., 31683=However, despite the increased number of Fresnel reflections, the conventional approach to solving this problem is to use a three-section DBR laser, comprising gain, phase and Bragg sections as described by S. Murata, I. Mito and K. Kobayashi in \u201cTuning ranges for 1.5 \u03bcm wavelength tunable DBR lasers\u201d, Electron. Lett., vol. 24, pp. 577-579, 1988. In the three section laser, electrical current is also injected into the phase section to adjust the phase of the feedback from the DBR by means of carrier-induced refractive index changes. With the addition of a wavelength reference, this permits stabilization and fine-tuning of the mode frequency, resulting in continuous tuning of the device output wavelength over the entire available range. Other structures derived from the DBR laser are also used, including: sampled grating DBR (SG-DBR) described in C. K. Gardiner, R. G. S. Plumb, P. J. Williams and T. J. Ried, \u201cWavelength tuning in three section sampled grating DBR lasers\u201d, Electron. Lett., vol. 31, pp. 1258-1260, 1995; superstructure grating DBR (SSG-DBR) described in Y. Tohmori, Y. Yoshikuni, T. Tamamura, H. Ishii, Y. Kondo and M. Yamamoto, \u201cBroad-range wavelength tuning in DBR lasers with super structure grating (SSG), IEEE Photon. Technol. Lett., vol. 5, pp. 126-129, 1993; and grating coupled sampled reflectors (GCSR) described in M. Oberg, S. Nilsson, K. Streubel, J. Wallin, L. Backbom and T. Klinga, \u201c74 nm wavelength tuning range of an InGaAsP/InP vertical grating assisted codirectional coupler laser with rear sampled grating reflector\u201d, IEEE Photon. Technol. Lett., vol. 5, pp. 735-738, 1993. All these devices are capable of continuous tuning with a larger wavelength tuning range.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As the device shown in FIG. 6 is a simple DBR with only two sections, the controlling algorithms are simpler than that required by conventional tunable laser designs. The hop-free operation means that only a simple, straight-forward look-up table is required for control and stabilization. Thus, as illustrated in FIG. 6, the microprocessors that are generally used in the control of conventional tunable laser diodes can be replaced by simple error amplifiers 21, 22 which are cheaper and faster in operation. Furthermore, the problems associated with device aging can be substantially mitigated, leading to a wavelength and power stabilized device which can exhibit long term hop-free operation, as compared to devices with more than two sections and correspondingly more electrodes. Further improvements to the performance of the two-section DBR laser can be made including stabilizing the output power and wavelength, by using conventional techniques such as monitor detectors, filters and feedback control loops, for example. The schematic of FIG. 6 shows an example of a suitable feedback and control system. Detectors 20 can be integrated internally or externally, to monitor the output power and wavelength. By feeding the resulting signals into error amplifiers 21, 22 together with signals derived from a reference power 23 and wavelength 24, variations in the output power and wavelength can be detected. With the addition of a feedback loop and control electronics, the output power and wavelength of the laser 25",
