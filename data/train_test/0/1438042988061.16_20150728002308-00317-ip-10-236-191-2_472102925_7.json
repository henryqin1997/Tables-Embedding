The domain administrator receives the IP multicast address request from the mobile terminal, which includes a unique mobile terminal identifier for the mobile terminal (step 32). The domain administrator processes the IP multicast address request and offers an administrative IP multicast address to the mobile terminal (step 34). The domain administrator then assigns the offered administrative IP multicast address to the mobile terminal in accord with the IETF document RFC 1531, the internet standard, (step 36), and distributes the assigned administrative IP multicast address to the mobile terminal by transmitting the administrative IP multicast address to the mobile terminal (step 38). The domain administrator records the mobile terminal's unique mobile terminal identifier and allocated administrative IP multicast address to track the use of the IP multicast address (step 40). Recording the allocation of administrative IP multicast addresses allows the domain administrator to determine administrative IP multicast address availability when allocating administrative IP multicast addresses, as well as providing a record of prior administrative IP multicast address allocation to mobile terminals when offering administrative IP multicast addresses to a mobile terminal. The mobile terminal receives its administrative IP multicast address assigned by the domain administrator and stores its administrative IP multicast address, thereby enabling the mobile terminal to establish multicast network connections with the wireless IP network (step 42).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Referenced by [0057] While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. [0056] An IP network connection can be terminated and its IP multicast address released by the DHCP server timing out after a predetermined period of time. Alternatively, if a mobile terminal turns off, it can relinquish its IP multicast address to the DHCP server. [0055] The multicast agent receives the mobile terminal's unicast IP addresses, IP multicast address and mobile terminal identifier, and generates a unicast IP address table for the mobile terminal (step 80). The unicast IP address table maps each of the mobile terminal's unicast IP addresses to the mobile terminal's IP multicast address and mobile terminal identifier, thereby enabling the wireless IP network to determine the corresponding IP multicast address for information communicated to a mobile terminal's unicast IP address. The multicast agent forwards the mobile terminal's unicast IP address table to the IP network edge routers (step 82), which are configured to replace the mobile terminal's unicast IP addresses with the mobile terminal's IP multicast address when communicating information between the mobile terminal and the wireless IP network (step 84). Thus, when an edge router receives information",
