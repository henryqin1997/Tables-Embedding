    "textAfterTable": "Ozark Ozark, MO (Zone 6a) January 1, 2010 8:32 PM Post #7417290 Wow, CountryGardens, that's a big and good-looking pepper patch. I agree that peppers do best with a lot of water, and I've found that crowding them together and giving them a whole bunch of water really causes high production. I've got enough of the \"regular\" wire tomato cages (the ones that aren't really big enough for tomatoes) to put a cage around every other pepper seedling in the row. Then I run a cord the whole length of the row, attaching the cages together. Pepper plants don't take as much support and tying up as tomatoes, but they need some. Mine always bear so heavy the weight of peppers breaks off side branches, so I try to tie those up before they break. I'm going to order Lipstick pepper seeds from Johnny's, as well as the General Lee cucumbers I got from there and tried for the first time in my 2009 garden. I think I finally found the perfect cucumber with those, they're great. The Delectible sweet corn from Johnny's is a real good one, too. Strangely enough, I don't think Johnny's offers Gypsy pepper seeds, so I'll have to get those somewhere else. I won't grow a garden without Gypsy, that's for sure.",
