    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations FIG. 16 is an embodiment of the circuit block ZC-- REC which introduces a delay or anticipation, of continuously updatable value, on the ZC-- SHIFT synchronization signal output by the system of the invention. FIG. 13 illustrates with greater details a BEMF signal reconstruction circuit architecture, according to the invention. FIG. 14 shows an embodiment of the B-PWM conversion circuit, that is of the byte/PWM circuit incorporating also a level shifting circuit of FIG. 12b. FIG. 15 shows an embodiment of the block SUB of FIG. 12b. The block SQUARE&SHIFT generates the signal ZC-- SHIFT starting from a ZC signal and introducing a proper anticipation or delay by means of the ZC-- REC block based on the value contained in a shift register REG-- SHIFT, whose content is continuously updated by the TORQUE OPTIMIZER, depicted in FIGS. 10 and 11. The function and architecture of such a TORQUE OPTIMIZER are disclosed in the prior European Patent Application No 96830190.3, whose content is herein incorporated by reference. It is desirable for this signal to possess a relatively high frequency (>100 Khz) so that the influence of the PWM filter on the signal reconstruction process may be relatively low. In practice the \u03a3 and PWMFILTER blocks produce a reconstructed BEMF signal, defined in the scheme as BEMF-- REC. The block SUB outputs the byte difference of B-- INA and B-- INB. This difference is converted by the byte/PWM",
