            "Campus safety is a priority for the staff at Keiser University. If you do not have a visible student or faculty badge security at the front door will make sure they ask you if you belong there.",
            "There are a couple of Greek fraternities located on campus. One of the Fraternities is for academic students who maintain high GPAs, the other is Omega Delta Sigma National Veterans Fraternity which is a coed fraternity for Military veterans of the armed forces.",
            "Keiser University is the perfect school for students that love small class sizes as well as friendly and very helpful staff and professors.",
            "You will receive all the bang for your buck at Keiser University. There are no large lecture halls where you are one of a hundred students, you will receive personnel tutoring if you are having trouble understanding a subject.",
            "Keiser University often has student appreciation days were they will serve student Hamburgers, Hot dogs, chips and sodas for free to the students.",
            "Located on campus is a very quaint dinner that serves a different main meal every day, as well as the favorite fast foods like pizza and subs.",
            "There are no dorms located at Keiser University",
            "The academics at Keiser University I do not find to be very rigorous or intimidating. Any time I may feel I do not understand a subject or may have more questions the Professors and tutors are very glad to help and explain things for you.",
            "To maintain a good GPA do not skip any homework assignments. After getting the hang of writing essays in APA format it will become much easier for you.",
            "I would rate Keiser University very high and respect the style of teaching. Weather you are a on campus student or an online student, the knowledge of the professors in the areas of study are vast."
