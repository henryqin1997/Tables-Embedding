It is located downtown on a campus shared by CUD and CCD (higher ed schools) completing what is called the Auraria Campus. Amenities include lite rail transportation, public library and easy access to food nearby., 528610=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 127604=Register on the day registration is available. If you take loans, complete everything in April or you will want to kick yourself in August. This isn't high school. The academic work is more challenging but the experience definitely is not. Show up, pay attention, and leave. College is only as hard as you make it., 149530=When I visited this school in March of 2012, I was shocked by the huge campus and the amazing campus amenities (Starbucks on campus? Oh, yeah!). Everyone I met there was so nice and helpful, even the student who had nothing to gain from helping me out. In short, this school seems like a great one and I can't wait to attend!, 120158=If you are willing to push yourself, you can make even the freshman level classes as hard as you want. I had papers that were supposed to be about 1200 words for English comp, but I talked with my teacher to get extended time and ended up writing pieces about 3000 words in length. Now, those papers are being submitted to editors and publisher and will hopefully be in the hands of the public sometime soon! =P, 148771=While I am not currently enrolled in this school, from what I can tell of my March visit here, the academic rigor is above average, because of the wonderful teachers employed by the school and the inventive and original curriculum's they have put together.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck For being such a big school its really cheap. You don't have to pay an arm and a leg to go there. But just because the tuition is low it doesn't mean that its a bad school. I'm happy that they have made it where you don't have to pay so much just to get a higher education. Am enjoying being here i really like how many students go there. There are a lot of students from different ages and cultural backgrounds. And you can't say that there's nothing to do there. Your right there in Downtown Denver. There's always something going on at the campus that you can join in on. Am learning a lot The learning level is good. There are a lot of different type of teachers there and from the one I've had they were really cool. Plus if for what ever reason you didn't understand the teacher they all have a wide range of office hours that you can go to. If you still don't get it you can always ask one of the other teachers in that department. Then there's always the old fashion way and that's going in for tutoring from students who might be able to explain it to",
