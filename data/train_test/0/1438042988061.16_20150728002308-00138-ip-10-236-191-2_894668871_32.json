They also occasionally have music and movies on the yard., 97018=I will be an incoming Freshman of the class 2016. My visit was okay, despite the delay of my Flights for Los Angeles. Tuskegee is a very beautiful campus. The weather is kind of weird and its changes. The hottest mont is August and the coldest month is October. There people there are friendly and they welcome and treat you like your home. Its a big change if your a city girl like me., 168606=Can't comment since I'll start school in fall 2012., 241286=I went to Tuskegee because it was close to home (less than 45 minutes away); because my uncle is an alum and because my Mom wanted me to get a great education in an area that would afford me the opportunity to be self-paced. I have Aspberger's Syndrome and she has carefully navigated my path since I was 6 years old. This has been the best thing that I have ever done for myself and I hope to get my master's Degree when I graduate in May of 2013., 273179=Dorm life at Tuskegee University can be overwhelming and misleading. Not all dorms are the same; some are a lot better than others. In most dorms on campus, there is a public bathroom on each floor which contains about twenty people. There is one kitchen for the entire building and one microwave for each floor if the residence hall makes it available to the students. There is no curfew; however, opposite sex visitors are only allowed in the designated lounge between 4:00 p.m. and 12:00 midnight. Mandatory meetings come around eight times for each semester. Students who do not attend these meetings will be fined., 405953=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 201294=The food is a 6 out of 10. At times the cafeteria has decent meals and other times they don't. Our cafeteria is in a temporary building due to the reconstruction of the old cafeteria, which should be ready Fall 2012}",
