Another feature of the invention is the dispensation with a TLB replacement algorithm circuit. This features has the advantage of drastically reducing the hardware volume and reducing the overall size of the system. One of the characteristic features of the present invention consists in the simplification of the real address referencing path from the TLB to determine the machine cycle. This characteristic makes it possible to substantially reduce gate delays, resulting in the advantage of shortening the machine cycle of the system. The processing of request \u25cb1 under bypass control from the TBWR 120 and that of the succeeding requests \u25cb2 and \u25cb3 are achieved in exactly the same way as the case described with reference to FIG. 4. Therefore, the foregoing processing automatically rewrites the address translation pair having the lowest rank of priority, registered in the TLB 143, and a TLB replacement algorithm circuit using an LRU algorithm or the like is thereby dispensed with. At the timing when the SWAP 206 is set to logical \"1\", the logical \"1\" of the SWAP 106 is inverted to logical \"0\" by the logical inverting gate 236, and supplied to the AND gates 256, 257, 258 and 259.
