            "I have never felt unsafe here on campus. They have emergency poles everywhere and you can even call campus patrol to walk you home. You rarely here of anything bad happening to anyone.",
            "The Greek life here is not as prominent as I would say other colleges are. The life is here though and is promoted if you are interested in doing so.",
            "The year is started off with a fair promoting all the clubs and activities here at Ohio University. If you are interested in it they have something for you. The leaders of these clubs want people with the same interest to join and that shows.",
            "Ohio University is great for the students who want to get away from home and find out just who they are. Students who want to find a good medium between tedious school work and a fun and exciting social life. The location is good for students who want to be away from a city and can find themselves.",
            "Ohio University has been known for its tradition as being the number 1 party school and has good reason for it. The fests attract a lot of people to Athens while Halloween is known as the largest party going on. There are many other things to do though other than party.",
            "The tuition at Ohio is currently raising, I don't quite agree with that. While the professors are almost exceptional in every way, most lectures are big and don't focus on individuals. I would also like to see the tuition money go towards making newer residency halls.",
            "Get involved with some clubs and other organizations. Athens is a small town but there is a lot going on in it that a lot of people do not know about. With a ton of student organizations and an interesting night life, Ohio has everything to offer to keep you having fun.",
            "The dining halls are legit here at Ohio compared to other dining halls I have been at elsewhere. They are constantly trying to accommodate to the students needs and find what they want. You have to also look 'uptown' where there are a ton of good restaurants, ranging from mediterranean food to hot dogs at O'betty's.",
            "The dorms are a good thing for incoming freshman and help you adjust to meeting new people. The friends I met when I first moved in are still some of the most supportive and trusting people I know. The only downside is that other people may not be as cleanly as you want them to be.",
            "Based on your major Ohio University can be a big eye opener in the amount of studying you have to put into your school work. Taking about an hour a day for each class is pretty realistic for any major. The best thing I have found to do is to take the rigorous classes mixed with a few electives.",
            "Come to school with the mindset to work hard, when you are a full time student attending classes should be like going to work. Success comes with hard work, the grades you want to get are not easy to come by, they require a lot more work than high school. Have fun, getting your priorities straight and making time for fun is essential.",
            "Ohio University is the place to come if you are looking for a college that has its city based around it. Its a small quaint town with brick roads that has a very tight community in which people help one another. The academics are challenging yet the atmosphere of the city helps you really get an interesting social life with your peers as well."

The 110 performs at all football and basketball games (men and women). They have performed around the world; from Rome and Ireland in 2013 to being invited to perform in China during the 60's. Along with the band though, the university's sports have been performing extremely well over the past few years, including 5 straight bowls for the football team, and a recent Sweet 16 run for the men's basketball team. There are other events that happen on Court Street in Athens, the craziest 1/2 mile in all of Ohio. Home to over 20 bars and a ton of restaurants, there is always something to do in Athens, Ohio!, 339987=I am not familiar with a lot at this time since school just started this week but there is a March 110 that takes all the incoming freshman. The band plays and marches across the main campus bridge with freshman class following them. It is really cool!, 645160=Halloween is HUGE at Ohio University. Rated the best campus to be on in the United States on Oct. 31st.}",
