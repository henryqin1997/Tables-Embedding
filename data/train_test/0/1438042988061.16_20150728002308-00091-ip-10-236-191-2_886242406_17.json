            "Students that may or may not have an idea of what they want to major in, but who can thrive on the fast pace and difficulty of college classes. Michigan is also great for students who enjoy the bustling city of Ann Arbor. For those who are great at meeting and interacting with diverse groups of people, Michigan is a perfect fit. For those who do not have that type of experience, Michigan will definitely challenge them to step out of their comfort zone a bit. I believe Michigan is great for all types of students!",
            "Don't be shy, meet as many people as possible! You never know who will become a lifelong friend. Sit by people you don't know in the cafeteria, introduce yourself to everyone in your hall, talk to people at bus stops and those who sit next to you in class. Get involved with a group, club, or organization you are interested in as soon as you arrive in Ann Arbor. Do not overload yourself with activities or work hours, because homework and studying will definitely take a long time. Make sure you get to know your professors and GSIs on a more personal level by going to their office hours, even if it is just to introduce yourself. Thoroughly research academic areas of study and do not be afraid to change your major. Do not let the size of the university scare you; if you get involved with activities on campus and make an effort to get to know your professors, GSIs and classmates, the experience will seem smaller.",
            "Tuition and Room/Board is definitely more expensive then I would like it to be. The experience is definitely worth the money. One way I have defrayed the cost of my education is by working in the dining hall, where I have made a lot of friends and have gotten valuable work experience.",
            "There are so many people to meet from so many different parts of the country, as well as the world. Learning takes place outside of the classroom just by experiencing community living in the dorms. I love being involved in dorm life, working in the cafeteria, and participating in activities and service projects through my church in Ann Arbor.",
            "There are so many academic areas to explore that are bound to fulfill any interest. I have taken classes in biology, chemistry, calculus, anthropology, psychology, and English just in my first year at Michigan! Michigan does a fantastic job making sure my academic experience is well-rounded."

It has given me the opportunity to meet new people and has aspired me to do new things. I look forward to graduating in 2015 and continuing into graduate school at University of Michigan- Ann Arbor so I rate U of M- Ann Arbor a 10 out of 10., 823031=U of M looks for the ideal well-balanced individual. Make sure that you balance a high GPA with decent extracurricular activities and a high SAT/ACT score. For those that want actual numbers: based on the students I have met here, most tend to come in with around a 3.8 or higher GPA and a fairly decent SAT score of 2000., 888428=Check out Restaurant Week. Twice a year (one week in January, and one week in June), select restaurants have a fixed menu for a fixed price (usually both lunch and dinner). It's a great way to experience expensive restaurants for a fraction of the price you would otherwise pay. Also, in January there's a concert at Hill Auditorium called the Collage Concert. Students from the School of Music, Theatre and Dance put on an incredibly diverse and fun concert. It's fun to see what your fellow wolverines on North Campus are doing all year! Go to the Arb, too. While most of Ann Arbor is more industrialized, the Arb is a great getaway for some time in nature., 625593=Over a 1000 different clubs., 348117=Nichols Arboretum (The Arb) is a popular place to go for a run or to hang out and clear your head. The Safe Sex Store on South University is a classic store. Ann Arbor is well-known for Zingerman's deli, which has excellent sandwiches and other delightful treats. Legend has it that if you kiss someone under the arch between east hall and west hall by south university and the diag at midnight, you will marry them. Also, we have a hash bash in April that is one of the biggest. Not endorsing that, just saying, it's there and it's unusual., 825668=There are over 1200 clubs on campus, so you can definitely find something that interests you., 838537=Check out Festifall and Winterfest to learn about some of our 2300 student clubs. There's something for everyone! From the many premed clubs to the community service clubs to the squirrel feeding club, you're sure to fit in somewhere., 608871=The campus is right in the city of Ann Arbor and is open to the public. Therefore, anybody can just walk on campus. There were several crime alerts throughout the 2011-2012 school year, but there was nothing really serious or violent. There are also many safety officials on campus., 181321=One very important aspect that I foolishly overlooked when applying to college was their academic schedule. Every university has a difficult schedule and some are more desirable than others. Michigan'\u00c2?s is a bit strange in that its summers are exceptionally long. School begins in early September and exams tend to be over around May 1st. The generous 4 month long summer happens because our Winter Break is far shorter than those elsewhere. Since I am an out-of-state student, I found flying home for such a brief time to be fairly annoying. If you can'\u00c3?\u00c2?t decide between schools, consider which summer and winter break trade-off would best suit your plans. For in-state students, who comprise roughly 2/3 of the student body, a good tip is to try and forge your own path away from your high school classmates. I know many in-state students who hung out with high school friends instead of meeting new hall-mates and classmates at the beginning of Freshman Year and later regretted this thoroughly. Make sure to come to Orientation and the beginning of Freshman Year ready to make new friends and connections. My roommate of three years was actually the 2nd person I met at Michigan. Michigan's weather is something that should not be taken lightly. I always thought I wanted a cold, northern university but I soon grew tired of how cold it gets in Michigan. Coming from Maryland, I was neither physically nor mentally prepared for the 5 months of frigid, snowy weather that Ann Arbor gets every year. While this does not make me regret coming to school at Michigan, it does make me regret not having a heavy winter coat and boots during my Freshman Year., 311266=Apply early. The longer you wait, the more competitive the admissions process becomes. If you're applying to the LSA Honors Program, try to write a good essay, but if it's late April and you still haven't submitted your application, just get something in before they fill up., 918551=University of Michigan is a huge campus and a lot of things are going on all the time in every department. I'm going to be joining the music department and this department alone houses at least 1000 students and recitals occur every day as well as rehearsals and concerts. Like in music, UMich is extremely strong in many areas and those students who want a greater challenge can even apply to be in special colleges for those who desire to get more out of their education., 106843=Be sure to apply early, as the increasing number of applicants put those who apply after the Early Action deadline at a disadvantage. Since Early Action is non-binding, it's also helpful so that you find out earlier and can begin planning, especially since this year many applicants didn't hear back until the end of April, 393787=over 1300 student groups. enough said. there is always something to do here. oh, and yeah we have a squirrel club with like 900 members that feed squirrels every sunday with peanuts., 750942=Apply for the November 1st Early Action Deadline. TOUR., 1105043=Superb dining experience in the newly renovated halls, though a few of the older ones are left in the dust and serve lackluster food. Stick to the more popular, new dining halls and find one that you like and eat there often. It can be very difficult to maintain a healthy diet given the amount of unhealthy options, desserts, and oil/fat included in most foods but it is possible. If you're trying to avoid the freshman 15, you have to be one of the rare ones who keeps the priority of health all year! For 2015, the West Quad dining hall is the one being renovated and will be newly opened, so try there if looking for a first option.}",

There is a high level of competition here, but there are also classes and departments where group work is the main method for homework. All types of students can thrive here, they just need to find their niche. Tips for prospective students Apply early! You'll find out if you got in a lot earlier, and it will increase your chance of getting in, too. Also, don't expect A's here. There is a high level of competition and you can't just skate by just by going to classes and taking notes. One more thing, don't be intimidated by the huge size of this school. It's really easy to make your own smaller school within the bigger university, especially if you're in the engineering school, school of kinesiology, or the business school.",
