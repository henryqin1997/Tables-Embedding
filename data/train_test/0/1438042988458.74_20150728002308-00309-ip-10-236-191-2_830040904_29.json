Barbara L. | 03/30/2012 Read Full Review Wonderful Condo! Walking into this condo was like walking into sunshine! Everything is bright, cheerful, and very, very clean. The unit is furnished very well and has wonderful amenities. A big plus is being next to South Beach Marina, the beach, swimming, and tennis. We will definitely request Bluff Villa unit 1811 in the future if we are fortunate enough to be able to return to Hilton",
