Given that trade is balanced in steady state, this parameterization implies an import or export to GDP ratio for the home country (the United States) of about 12 percent. We choose population levels and so that the home country constitutes about 25 percent of world output. This implied an import (or export) share of output of the foreign country of about 4 percent.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{82721=Finally, we consider a case in which agents have imperfect information about whether the shock to government consumption is highly persistent or transitory. As noted above, our benchmark model implies significantly more rapid adjustment of output and the expenditure components to a fiscal expansion than is implied by estimates from structural VARs, or by large-scale policy models such as the FRB/Global model (see Levin et al. 1997, for a description of this model). Accordingly, we introduce an \"information friction\" as a mechanism for eliciting more gradual responses, and to help evaluate whether such changes in model structure have important implications for the response of the trade balance., 95654=Hooper, P., Marquez, J., 1995.
