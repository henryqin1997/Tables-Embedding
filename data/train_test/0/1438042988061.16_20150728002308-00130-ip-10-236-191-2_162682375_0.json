            "It was a very strange play, it was as if everyone stopped once the defensemen dropped out of the zone.",
            "That's like saying the last 2 weeks of the basketball season are not indicative of how teams will play in the NCAA tourney. You're not going to get a much more representative sample. The playoffs start in 4 weeks. How they play now is a lot better indicator than how they played in December.",
            "Tops in the County? State? Wow, how do you take a talent like Reggie Benton and not use him to his maximum ability? Reggie was the best defensive back in the County (I believe he was all conference as a junior) and Joe never put him on the field defensively his senior year. Ridiculous. He loves offense, it's exciting to watch but he'll never go deep in the playoffs because he loves the offense at the expense of his defense. Inevitably, the run into a team that can stuff the run and understand that Joe will not throw across the middle of the field. I have watched GB football since 1977, played for GB for two years and went on to play college ball. Joe taught me things about the game that helped me be successful in college so don't put me in the \"whiner\" category. He is a good person, a decent technical coach and a poor strategist. GB can do better. Joe has underachieved with the talent he has had over the years. I guess we disagree.",
            "Wins- UMass BGSU MSU Illinois Losses- UConn (They are going to be very good) PSU OSU Iowa Wiscy Toss Ups ND Indiana Purdue and I am assuming we lose one game we shouldn't. It's pessimitic but I guess that's where Michigan Football has taken me in the last 5 years.",
            "beyond that looks bright. I just don't see 6 wins in 2010 with that schedule and that defense. I fear that no bowl game would be the end for RR. I hope I'm wrong.",
            "is a joke. I played for him in '85 and '86. He thinks of himself as a offensive genius but the only thing he does is throw out routes, fades and reverses. He goes away from the running game to easily (see Romeo loss). Can't blame Ingram for leaving. The system fits Hayes very well and I think he could contribute at UM. Rimor is that Joe may be stepping down in which case GB Football could beocome a giant, the talent is there."
