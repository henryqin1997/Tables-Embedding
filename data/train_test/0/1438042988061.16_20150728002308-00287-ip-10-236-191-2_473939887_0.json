Rich has graduated from the Army ROTC (Reserve Officer Training Corps) Leader Development and Assessment Course, also known as \u201cOperation Warrior Forge,\u201d at Fort Lewis, Tacoma, Wash. The 32 days of training provide the best possible professional training and evaluation for all cadets in the aspects of military life, administration and logistical support.\u00a0 Although continued military training and leadership development is included in the curriculum, the primary focus of the course is to develop and evaluate each cadet\u2019s officer potential as a leader by exercising the cadet\u2019s intelligence, common sense, ingenuity and physical stamina.\u00a0 The cadet command assesses each cadet\u2019s performance and progress in officer traits, qualities and professionalism while attending the course. Cadets in their junior and senior year of college must complete the leadership development course.\u00a0 Upon successful completion of the course, the ROTC program, and graduation from college, cadets are commissioned as second lieutenants in the U.S. Army, National Guard, or Reserve. Rich is the son of Al P. and Rhonda M. Rich of Williamstown and he is a 2007 graduate of Williamstown High School., 35532=Copyright \u00a9 2015}",
