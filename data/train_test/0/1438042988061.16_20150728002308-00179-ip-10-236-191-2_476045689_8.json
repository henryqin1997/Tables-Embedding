The structures are also robust as compared to other structures. A variety of attachment combinations can now be employed: [0031] Direct chip attachment of the drive circuitry to the back of the substrate permits high density circuit fabrication. The substrate itself facilitates interconnection. This structure has resistors buried in the multilayer ceramic and thus the resistors are not inconveniently large and discrete. [0030] The invention has a number of structural advantages that permit scaling. [0029] Mounting the wafer or MEMS structure directly onto the mechanically robust LTCC",
