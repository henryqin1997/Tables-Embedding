While yesterday\u2019s 1.1-inning outing from CC Sabathia provided an exclamation point on a bad stretch, the pitching has generally not been the problem. Yanks\u2019 hurlers have a 3.84 ERA over their last 12 games and are striking out 8.4 men per 9 innings over that stretch. Opponents are hitting just .234/.316/.409 off the Yankees\u2019 staff. Since holding onto that first place lead, the Yankees have lost five games in the standings to the Red Sox. They sit four out of first place, just one game ahead of the third-place Blue Jays and two ahead of the charging Rays. My, how times have changed. Two weeks later, the outcome is much bleaker than anyone would have expected it to be. The Yankees went to Boston and got swept in a three-game set. They eked out a 2-1 series victory over the Mets thanks in large part to a freak play in the bottom of the 9th inning of",
    "textAfterTable": "As the chart shows, two-thirds of the Yankee lineup have been producing at OPS levels under .700 for the better part of two weeks. Derek Jeter, Jorge Posada, Melky Cabrera, Johnny Damon, Nick Swisher and Alex Rodriguez are dragging down the offense. More problematic as well is the prolonged absence of Hideki Matsui from the Yankee lineup. As Interleague play moved to the NL parks, the Yanks lost one of their hottest hitters. For the optimists among us, this chart provides some comfort. These players won\u2019t continue to perform at below-average rates for much longer. That these players ran into slumps as the pitchers heated up is the Yanks\u2019 bad luck, though. It\u2019s small comfort to look ahead and hope for the next hot streak, but it will come soon. When it does, the Yanks can charge up the standings just as swiftly as they fell. email",
