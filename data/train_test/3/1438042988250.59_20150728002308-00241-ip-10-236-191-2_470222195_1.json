Allegations of corruption, gross negligence, and mafia involvement! It seemed to set up the rest of the book for more awesomeness where the author investigates the events surrounding the fire and the key figures involved, but instead starts to get more gossipy into Venice social life. And while the book had enough colorful and interesting characters (I found the story of the rat man and the scandal with the Ezra Pound estate to be the most interesting), it doesn't compare to the potential story of the Fenice, which is what I thought the book was supposed to be about in the first place. Instead, it dramatically burns down, some politicians scream at each other, and the last chapter brings us back to the restored Fenice, which quietly gets rebuilt while the author was researching this book. I wish the book had pictures, the book vividly describes the Fenice as well as its landmarks and palaces, and it would have been nice to have pictures at hand as a point of reference. ...more",

The story of Nora, her pro-Western translator in Jordan, and her disillusionment after the Abu Ghraib scandal was haunting: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty bad, huh, Megan.\u201d \u201cYeah, it\u2019s bad,\u201d I said. \u201cBut are you really surprised?\u201d Her eyes flickered. \u201cOf course!\u201d But Nora, it\u2019s war.

Like an accusation. \u201cThis is the Americans.\u201d \u2026 \u201cBut Nora\u2026\u201d That sentence fell off in a sigh. All the questions were piled up in my throat: Did you really believe in us? Did you think we came to Iraq to fight a noble war, did you honestly think that? Don\u2019t you see what we have done? \u2026 \u201cBut Megan,\u201d she said slowly, \u201cthat\u2019s the point.

That is the idea of America.\u201d (pp 120-222) It reminded me of the quote from the movie first knight, when King Arthur (played by Sean Connery in full-on awesome mode) explains Camelot: \"There are laws that enslave men. And laws that set them free. Either what we hold to be right and good and true is right and good and true for all mankind under God, or we're just another robber tribe.\" This book really brings home the fact (to the people in the Middle East as well as to me) that especially post 9/11, the United States is acting like just another robber tribe. ...more",

            "review This book seemed to be more of an application of Bayes Theorem and other statistical techniques in various fields rather than some overarching techniq This book seemed to be more of an application of Bayes Theorem and other statistical techniques in various fields rather than some overarching technique of how to apply these techniques, so it felt more like a collection of anecdotes than a unified thesis. One thing I thought was interesting is that the author drew a distinction between between 'foxes' and 'hedgehogs,' with foxes knowing many things and able to draw different fields who to solve a problems, and hedgehogs knowing few things and draw upon a few governing principles to solve a problem, and Silver favors the 'fox' way of thinking to make predictions. The fox and the hedgehog comparison was made in Jim Collin's book Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap...And Others Don't, and it's interesting to see how he applies the fox and hedgehog story Picture two animals: a fox and a hedgehog. Which are you? An ancient Greek parable distinguishes between foxes, which know many small things, and hedgehogs, which know one big thing. All good-to-great leaders, it turns out, are hedgehogs. They know how to simplify a complex world into a single, organizing idea\u2014the kind of basic principle that unifies, organizes, and guides all decisions. That\u2019s not to say hedgehogs are simplistic. Like great thinkers, who take complexities and boil them down into simple, yet profound, ideas (Adam Smith and the invisible hand, Darwin and evolution), leaders of good-to-great companies develop a Hedgehog Concept that is simple but that reflects penetrating insight and deep understanding. What does it take to come up with a Hedgehog Concept for your company? Start by confronting the brutal facts. One good-to-great CEO began by asking, \u201cWhy have we sucked for 100 years?\u201d That's brutal\u2014and it's precisely the type of disciplined question necessary to ignite a transformation. The management climate during a leap from good to great is like a searing scientific debate\u2014with smart, tough-minded people examining hard facts and debating what those facts mean. The point isn\u2019t to win the debate, but rather to come up with the best answers\u2014and, ultimately, to lock onto a Hedgehog Concept that works. Maybe they're unrelated concepts: be a fox to generate a vision and be a hedgehog to distill that concept into a simple and clear idea, but I don't know how many people have the capacity to perform the mental gymnastics to seamlessly switch between the two. In any case, Silver is very hedgehog-like to take a lot of small ideas in areas like baseball, weather forecasting, and chess to see how they can be improved with these data-driven techniques, but other than saying, \"Bayes Theorem...it's great!\" wasn't very fox-like in connecting the dots. ...more",

This book shows an alternative, more complex characterization of Thomas Cromwell, and it\u2019s really interesting to see how the author uses the same historical context to totally reverse the preconceptions I had about Cromwell, More, and the other characters. In Shakespeare\u2019s Julius Caesar, Brutus was \u201cthe noblest of Romans\u201d who sided with the conspirators because he was concerned only for the good of the people, but in Dante\u2019s Inferno, Brutus was a traitor cast down to the lowest circle of hell suffering the worst torment for all eternity. Which characterization is closer to the actual historical figure? I have no idea, but it\u2019s interesting to see both sides. Reading the book I could never figure out Cromwell\u2019s motives for doing what he does, he plays the game masterfully but I don\u2019t know to what end. He is loyal to Wolsey, even after Wolsey falls out of favor and he has nothing to gain; he seems to care greatly of his household of random characters; he seems to do everything to serve the King, even though it was the King who sacked Wolsey in the first place; he doesn\u2019t really show any great desire for greater power or wealth even though both are given to him in abundance. For all of Cromwell\u2019s interaction with all the court women, I only found two lines that go to his feelings towards his deceased wife and why he managed to remain faithful (a minor miracle, considering all the dalliances that went on in Henry\u2019s court), and what is in his heart: Liz, he thinks, take your dead hand off me. Do you grudge me this one little girl, so small, so thin, so plain? He turns. \u201cJane-\u201d (p 490) And Cromwell seems to be doing his utmost to persuade Thomas More to swear the oath and save his life, but when More ultimately refused, these are the thoughts that are revealed: He thinks, I remembered you, Thomas More, but you didn\u2019t remember me. You never even saw me coming. (p 524) Since People Who Know Better Than Me gave this book a Man Booker Prize, I\u2019m assuming that this mystery is what makes this book so great to read instead of some egregious oversight on the author\u2019s part. It took a long time to read (one reason is that there are so many Thomas\u2019s to keep track of and the author has this annoying tendency to refer to Cromwell by pronoun, the other reason is that whenever Call-Me-Risley was mentioned, this song got stuck in my head), and it was a little disappointing that after reading so many pages of such a dense book, I still have no idea about what Cromwell\u2019s all about, but hopefully, that\u2019s what parts 2 and 3 are for.. ...more",

It's really interesting how the movem Great look at the self-help and actualization movement (SHAM) and how it does not live up to its lofty promises. It's really interesting how the movement affected not only the people who try these programs, but how its principles negatively affect our education and justice system and ultimately our cultural values. In spite of this, even if the methods the SHAM experts espouse are bunk, I do believe that the human mind is an amazing thing and capable of doing a lot. The placebo effect - unlike some of other SHAM alternative medicine theories - is clinically documented, and even one of the author's stories show what is possible when people are pushed into excellence: In the film, Stand and Deliver, the work of Jaime Escalante is honoured. He pushed his class of inner-city academic discards to remarkable performances - in calculus, no less. There is also another similar story about achievement where expectations were raised, rather than dumbing down to the lowest achievers level of acceptable self-esteem. A Chicago public-school teacher, Mary Daugherty found herself confronted by a class of sixth-graders who were so clueless and intractable that she suspected many of them had learning disabilities. So one day, while the principal was off the premises she broke a hard and fast rule and snuck a look in the file where student details, IQ scores and other relevant data was kept. She was amazed... most of her students had IQs in the high 120s and 130s - near genius level. One of the worst offenders had an IQ of 145. After some soul searching, Mrs Daugherty concluded that it was her fault that these brilliant minds had resorted to unruly behaviour... she blamed herself for boring them into misbehaviour. She began bringing in difficult assignments. She upped the amount of homework and inflicted stern punishments for misbehaviour. By the end of the semester, her class was one of the best behaved and the most accomplished in the entire sixth grade. Impressed, and stunned, her principal asked her how she had achieved this amazing turn around. Haltingly, she confessed that she had looked at the IQ files and she had changed her approach to teaching the class. The principal pursed his lips, smiled, and told her not to worry about it. All's well that ends well, he told her. \"Oh, by the way,\" he whispered as she turned to retreat to her classroom, \"I think you should know: those numbers next to the kids names? It's not their IQ scores. It's their locker numbers.\" (p 192-193)* So I think that we all are capable of leading awesome, empowered lives, but also that the power of positive thinking and quick fixes advocated by these SHAM experts are not enough to do so, especially when they talk about universal solutions that are supposed to apply equally well to people with very different backgrounds, values and ambitions. I'm hoping that the next book I'm reading (Mastery) may shed some light on light on it, but it sounds HARD. And I think that's the way it's supposed to be. * This story is pretty awesome, but sounds really fantastical, and the notes of the book do not document the source of this story. I couldn't find any attribution for this story doing a quick google search so I don't know exaggerated this story is or whether this is an urban legend. ...more",

So it was pretty surprising to see him write a book that zooms in from the big picture to really get into the nuts and bolts of how victory was achieved. Even though the house always wins in the long run in a casino, players are still capable of winning fantastical sums of money, and this is a story how how the Allies used some clever engineering to further stack the deck in their favor, so even if victory was at hand, it doesn't mean that the war would have ended when it did or there couldn't have been millions more casualties. Seems like the lessons learned would be applicable to large companies and VCs to find methods that can bring good ideas to the forefront and develop and scale them to really make a critical difference in their field of endeavor. Since I was a chemical engineering major, even though it didn't make a direct impact on the battlefield, I would have liked to see a chapter on the synthetic rubber program, but I'm an engineer, I like World War II history, so it was an interesting read. ...more",

Couple caveats: some of the facts seem a little tangential (a story about how linoleum was invented? really!?) and it got annoying when a lot of the origin stories can't be fully verified (I really wanted to know whether Philippe's really originated the french dip sandwich and the Buena Vista the Irish coffee, as they claimed).
