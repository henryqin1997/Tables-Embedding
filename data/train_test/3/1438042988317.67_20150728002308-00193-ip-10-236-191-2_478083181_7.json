The thus produced PSA web, comprising microfibers having an average diameter of less than about 25 \u03bcm, had a basis weight of 50 g/m2 and exhibited a peel strength to glass of 805 g/2.54 cm at a peel rate of 30.5 cm/min, 1264 g/2.54 cm at a peel rate of 228.6 cm/min, and a peel strength to polypropylene of 343 g/2.54 cm at a peel rate of 228.6 cm/min., 67759=A wide variety of resinous (or synthetic) materials commonly used in the art to impart or enhance tack of pressure-sensitive adhesive compositions may be used as a tackifier (i.e., tackifying resin). Examples include rosin, rosin esters of glycerol or pentaerythritol, hydrogenated rosins, polyterpene resins such as polymerized beta-pinene, coumaroneindene resins, \"C5\" and \"C9\" polymerized petroleum fractions, and the like. The use of such tack modifiers is common in the art, as is described in the Handbook of Pressure Sensitive Adhesive Technology, Second Edition, D. Satas, ed., Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York, N.Y., 1989. A tackifying resin is added in amounts required to achieve the desired tack level. Examples of suitable commercially available tackifiers include synthetic ester resins, such as that available under the trade designation FORAL 85 from Hercules Inc., Wilmington, Del., and aliphatic/aromatic hydrocarbon resins, such as those available under the trade designation ESCOREZ 2000 from Exxon Chemical Co., Houston, Tex. This is typically achieved by adding from 1 part to about 300 parts by weight of tackifying resin per 100 parts by weight of an acrylate copolymer. The tackifying resin is selected to provide the acrylate copolymers with an adequate degree of tack to maintain the resultant composition balanced pressure-sensitive adhesive properties including shear and peel adhesion. As is known in the art, not all tackifier resins interact with the acrylate copolymer in the same manner; therefore, some minor amount of experimentation may be required to select the appropriate tackifier resin and to achieve optimum adhesive performance. Such minor experimentation is well within the capability of one skilled in the adhesive art., 71654=Melt processes for the preparation of fibers are well-known in the art. For example, such processes are disclosed in Wente, \"Superfine Thermoplastic Fibers,\" in Industrial Engineering Chemistry, Vol. 48, pages 1342 et seq (1956); Report No. 4364 of the Naval Research Laboratories, published May 25, 1954, entitled \"Manufacture of Superfine Organic Fibers\" by Wente et al.; as well as in International Publication No. WO96/23915, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,338,992 (Kinney), 3,502,763 (Hartmann), 3,692,618 (Dorschner et al.), and 4,405,297 (Appel et al.). Such processes include both spunbond processes and melt-blown processes. A preferred method for the preparation of fibers, particularly microfibers, and nonwoven webs thereof, is a melt-blown process. For example, nonwoven webs of multilayer microfibers and melt-blown processes for producing them are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,176,952 (Joseph et al.), 5,232,770 (Joseph), 5,238,733 (Joseph et al.), 5,258,220 (Joseph), 5,248,455 (Joseph et al.). These and other melt processes can be used in the formation of the nonwoven webs of the present invention., 81212=An acrylate based PSA web was prepared using a melt blowing process similar to that described, for example, in Wente, \"Superfine Thermoplastic Fibers,\" in Industrial Engineering Chemistry, Vol. 48, pages 1342 et seq (1956) or in Report No. 4364 of the Naval Research Laboratories, published May 25, 1954, entitled \"Manufacture of Superfine Organic Fibers\" by Wente et al., except that the apparatus was connected to a melt-blowing die having circular smooth surfaces orifices (10/cm) (with a 5:1 length to diameter ratio. The feedblock assembly immediately preceding the melt blowing die, which was maintained at 220\ufffd C., was fed by stream of isooctyl acrylate/acrylic acid/styrene macromer (IOA/AA/Sty) terpolymer, the preparation of which is similar to that described in International Publication No. 96/26253 (Dunshee et al.) except that the IOA/AA/Sty ratio was 92/4/4 and the inherent viscosity of the terpolymer was approximately 0.65, at a temperature of 240\ufffd C., 100816=A PSA nonwoven web based on single component fibers using an acrylate blend was prepared essentially as described in EXAMPLE 1 except that the IOA/AA/Sty adhesive composition was replaced with a precompounded 10/90 blend of a IOA/AA/Sty terpolymer and a KRATON based PSA composition consisting of a 100 parts per hundred parts elastomer (phr) of KRATON D1112, 80 phr ESCOREZ 1310LC, 20 phr ZONAREZ A25, 4 phr IRGANOX 1076 antioxidant (available from CIBA-GEIGY Corp., Hawthorne, N.Y.), and 4 phr TINUVIN 328 UV stabilizer (available from CIBA-GEIGY Corp.), which was delivered to the die at a temperature of 210\ufffd C., the primary air was maintained at 212\ufffd C. and 234 KPa with a 0.076 cm gap width, and the collector to die distance was 17.8 cm. The thus produced PSA web, comprising microfibers having an average diameter of less than about 25 \u03bcm, was collected on a 1.5 mil (37 \u03bcm) poly(ethylene terephthalate film which passed around a rotating drum collector at a collector to die distance of 17.8 cm, had a basis weight of 48 g/m2 and exhibited a peel strength to glass of 1021 b/2.54 cm at a peel rate of 30.5 g/2.54 cm, 2119 g/2.54 cm at a peel rate of 228.6 cm/min and a peel strength to polypropylene of 2053 g/2.54 cm at a peel rate of 228.6 cm/min., 107269=A PSA web was prepared essentially as described in EXAMPLE 25 except that gear pumps were adjusted so that a 50/50 melt volume ratio of the IOA/AA/Sty//KRATON blend to the KRATON/ESCOREZ/ZONAREZ was delivered to the die. The resulting PSA web, comprising 3 layer microfibers having an average diameter of less than about 25 \u03bcm, had a basis weight of 54 g/m2 and exhibited a peel strength to glass of 511 g/2.54 cm at a peel rate of 30.5 cm/min, 1063 g/2.54 cm at a peel rate of 228.6 cm/min, and a peel strength to polypropylene of 601 g/2.54 cm at a peel rate of 30.5 cm/min, 663 g/2.54 cm at a peel rate of 228.6 cm/min., 107989=A PSA web was prepared essentially as described in EXAMPLE 25 except that gear pumps were adjusted so that a 25/75 melt volume ratio of the IOA/AA/Sty/KRATON blend to the KRATON/ESCOREZ/ZONAREZ multilayer melt stream was delivered to the die. The resulting PSA web, comprising 3 layer microfibers having an average diameter of less than about 25 \u03bcm, had a basis weight of 52 g/m2 and exhibited a peel strength to glass of 587 g/2.54 cm at a peel rate of 30.5 cm/min, 1055 g/2.54 cm at a peel rate of 228.6 cm/min, and a peel strength to polypropylene of 516 g/2.54 cm at a peel rate of 30.5 cm/min, 845 g/2.54 cm at a peel rate of 228.6 cm/min., 102172=A PSA nonwoven web was prepared essentially as described in EXAMPLE 20 except that the PSA composition consisted of a 25/75 blend of the IOA/AA/Sty terpolymer with the KRATON based PSA formulation which was delivered to the die at a temperature of 210\ufffd C., and the primary air was maintained at 190\ufffd C. and 152 KPa with a 0.076 cm gap width. The web was collected on a silicone coated kraft paper release liner which passed around a rotating drum collector at a collector to die distance of 20.3 cm. and laminated to a 1.5 mil (37 \u03bcm) poly(ethylene terephthalate) film for adhesive property evaluations. The thus produced PSA web, comprising microfibers having an average diameter of less than about 25 \u03bcm, has a basis weight of 49 g/m2 and exhibited a peel strength to glass of 788 g/2.54 cm at a peel rate of 30.5 cm/min, 1157 g/2.54 cm at a peel rate of 228.6 cm/min and a peel strength to polypropylene of 658 g/2.54 cm at a peel rate of 30.5 cm/min, 698 g/2.54 cm at a peel rate of 228.6 cm/min., 44349=Acrylate pressure-sensitive adhesive copolymers are advantageous because they show desirable adhesive properties over a broad temperature range to a wide variety of substrates. Such materials possess a four-fold balance of adhesion, cohesion, stretchiness, and elasticity, and a glass transition temperature (Tg) of less than about 20\ufffd C. Thus, they are tacky to the touch at room temperature (e.g., about 20\ufffd C. to about 25\ufffd C.), as can be determined by a finger tack test or by conventional measurement devices, and can easily form a useful adhesive bond with the application of light pressure. An acceptable quantitative description of a pressure-sensitive adhesive is given by the Dahlquist criterion line (as described in the Handbook of Pressure Sensitive Adhesive Technology, Second Edition, D. Satas, ed., Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York, N.Y. 1989, pages 171-176), which typically indicates that materials have a storage modulus (G') of less than about 3\ufffd105 Pascals (measured at 10 radian/second at a temperature of about 20\ufffd C. to about 22\ufffd C.) have pressure sensitive adhesive properties while materials having a G' in excess of this value do not (and are referred to herein as nonpressure-sensitive adhesive materials)., 103270=A PSA web was prepared essentially as described in EXAMPLE 20 except that the PSA composition consisted of a 50/50 blend of the IOA/AA/Sty terpolymer with the KRATON based formulation. The thus produced PSA web, comprising microfibers having an average diameter of less than about 25 \u03bcm, had a basis weight of 50 g/m2 exhibited a peel strength to glass of 618 g/2.54 cm at a peel rate of 30.5 cm/min, 1106 g/2.54 cm at a peel rate of 228.6 cm/min, and a peel strength to polypropylene of 358 g/2.54 cm at a peel rate of 30.5 cm/min, 358 g/2.54 cm at a peel rate of 228.6 cm/min., 103946=A PSA web was prepared essentially as described in EXAMPLE 20 except that the PSA composition consisted of a 75/25 blend of the IOA/AA/Sty terpolymer with the KRATON based formulation, the primary air was maintained at 212\ufffd C. and 234 KPa with a 0.076 cm gap width. The web was collected on a silicone coated kraft paper release liner which passed around a rotating drum collector at a collector to die distance of 17.8 cm and subsequently laminated to a 1.5 mil (37 \u03bcm) poly(ethylene terephthalate) film for adhesive property evaluations. The thus produced PSA web, comprising microfibers having an average diameter of less than about 25 \u03bcm, had a basis weight of 50 g/m2 and exhibited a peel strength to glass of 743 g/2.54 cm at a peel rate of 30.5 cm/min, 1542 g/2.54 cm at a peel rate of 228.6 cm/min and a peel strength to polypropylene of 655 g/2.54 cm at a peel rate of 228.6 cm/min.}",
