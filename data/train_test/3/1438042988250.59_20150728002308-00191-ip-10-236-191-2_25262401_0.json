For years graphite bats were thought of as being strong, but didn't hold up as well as aluminum. In the late 1990s, companies began to introduce carbon fiber composite bats. While they were durable, they didn't perform well. Things changed around the turn of the new century, and by 2001 the Louisville Slugger Genesis slow-pitch composite softball bat had become one of the top performing bats, rendering itself tough competition to aluminum. The only problem was durability. Today, there are a number of all-composite bats to choose from, mostly slow-pitch bats. For serious softball players, composite bats are the standard. There are a few composite models of baseball bats, but kids, and college-age players are preferring aluminum.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Charts for Determining Baseball Bat Length Children can use a wood bat at any age, provided they are old enough to swing a bat. Now that wood bats are making a comeback in amateur baseball, they can be used at any level provided they are a proper fit. Regardless of what performance bat a child prefers, whether aluminum, wood, composite or alloy, baseball pros agree the best way to train their swing is to have them consistently practice with a wood bat. What age can my child begin using a wood baseball bat? Top of Guide Moving up to a larger baseball bat kind of comes down to the child, how the swing feels, and common sense. About every couple of years, check your child's measurements to be sure they're still within range of correct bat sizes using regulation guidelines. If they're out of range, it's time to move up. By about age 11 or 12, a child may be moving up to the youth bat. The barrel will be a little bigger, about 2-1/2 inches compared to 2-1/4 inches. The length-to-weight ratio will go up from about a -8 to a -5, preparing them for a smooth transition to a professional series bat a couple years later. By about age 14, the child should be swinging a pro series baseball bat. How do I",
