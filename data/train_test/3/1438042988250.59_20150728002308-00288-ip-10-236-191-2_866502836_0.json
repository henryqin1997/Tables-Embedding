Please don't hesitate to contact the mentor(s) indicated in the proposal for any related clarification., 11077=Summary of idea: Replacement of old graphing with a new GWT implementation. This can be done with the help of existing graphing libraries for GWT. The replacement does not need to be 1:1, but there is freedom to implement different representations. A nice extension would be to be able to define a formula that translates the graph on the fly or where multiple metrics could be combined via formula., 33959=Below is a list of the ideas that have been proposed for the GSoC 2012 program. The ideas are organized by category.}",

The agent would talk to the RHQ server via the REST api and push metrics to RHQ etc. This agent will not implement the full functionality of the RHQ java agent. \u00a0 Status: Proposed \u00a0 Implement an RHQ agent in Python \u00a0 Notes: \u00a0 Associated project(s): RHQ (see below for more information",
