Recent transactions, such as Home Depot's purchase of 24 Kmarts for $160 per square foot, bear this out. RETAIL SPACE VALUE ON THE RISE On average across the United States, just under one in every three Americans plans on moving. Of those planning to move, the vast majority are looking to stay away from cities, with an average of 73 percent intending to relocate to the country, suburbs or a small town.

    "textAfterTable": "Phoenix has never-ending growth. There is always new development on the horizon in Phoenix, with older centers falling by the wayside, and recently, Westcor announced four future regional mall sites. Kierland Commons has become one of the country's most productive lifestyle centers, and now competition is on the way. Scottsdale dominates the high-end tenants and since Macerich has purchased Biltmore more couture tenants will be headed to Scottsdale. Chandler Mall has also been successful. However, the downtown area has been unable to provide meaningful retail, even though sports and entertainment venus are in place. Desert Ridge is a unique big-box center with many restaurants and a great selection of junior stores. Look for more Kierland type developments in years to come. LONG WALK ON A SHORT PIER 1 Ft.
