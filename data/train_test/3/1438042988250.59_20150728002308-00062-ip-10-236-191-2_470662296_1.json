Noelle runs a Christmas store (of course) which she opened in the town of Fool's Gold (really?) after a bout of Leukemia chased off her fiance and her employer. Gabriel is a trauma doctor for the US Army serving on life flights out of war zones with \"break\" rotations in Germany. He is understandably scarred and has an extreme commitment phobia. I don't know if it's because the book was a contemporary romance instead of a historical or just that their personal hills were very high and hard to climb or maybe I've just over-indulged in the genre during the last two weeks, but I rolled my eyes at the idea of these two people overcoming their extreme emotional baggage in 6 weeks to end up together in a Christmas package tied up with a nice neat little bow. My eyes hurt from the rolling and I had the urge a couple of times to throw the book across the wall in frustration from the cheesiness. ...more",

So he partners with a colored newspaper man and sets out to find out who was really the person pulling the strings for the assassination. It sounds to me as though David Stewart found an interesting nugget during his research, but not enough to substantiate it for there to be a non-fiction book. To explore his option, it had to be a fictionalized account. I think in the hands of a fiction writer, this could have been a page turner. Instead it was rather flat and I found myself reading chunks more through force of will than because I had to know what happens next. All-in-all a bit disappointing. ...more",

Either it just means there's no swearing or bedroom scenes or it means the c I have a love/hate relationship with books published by Christian labels. Either it just means there's no swearing or bedroom scenes or it means the characters have to overtly profess their faith on a regular basis. I have no problem with the former, but my personal faith is a quiet one and so ubiquitous professions of faith grates on me or feel forced. Unfortunately, I thought this book fell into the latter generalization, which colored my enjoyment of it. Adele is a Christian. She lives in Austria and plays violin with the Vienna Philharmonic during WWII. She is in love with Vladimir and is caught by the SS while trying sneak a Jewish family out of Austria. There is an extant painting of her as an Auschwitz prisoner which has haunted art historian Sera since she was 8 years old. William learns that the painting is key to the stipulations laid out in his grandfather's will and teams up with Sera to research the painting's provenance. As William and Sera trace the painting, they try to overcome their hesitations over the budding romance between them. The descriptions of Adele's life in Auschwitz were haunting. I did a little more research into the Auschwitz women's orchestra and was impressed that the author wove in actual members to her fictional account. I never felt like Sera or William learned any of Adele's story until the end of the book. There was something about her story's ending that didn't sit well with me, but I can't put my finger on why exactly it bothered me. I thought the contemporary storyline was trite. William and Sera had a \"whirlwind romance\" with a complete lack of passion (and I don't mean to imply that there needed to be physical passion). William's hesitation was never fully explained and their storyline was wrapped up abruptly. ...more",

The backdrop was superfluous to the story and I wish it had more bearing as it was a fascinating period of history. I wish this had been written as a generational saga with a linear timeline instead of the back and forth between modern and historical stories. This method of story-telling robbed the narrative of some of the suspense and history. Certain events HAD to happen because otherwise Clemmie's story wouldn't have happened, and these were unveiled in Chapter One. That being said, the characters were, as always, well written and fleshed out. I read large chunks of the book at a time because Lauren Willig is an impressive storyteller and I found myself having a hard time putting the book down. ...more",

I loved that the story was a bonding of sisters without needing a disease or unfaithful spouse to cause them to come together. I did find the last scene a little strange as well.

Lucy is a likeable character at a time where the role of women is drastically changing. She belongs to the upper echelon of Chicago society, but wants a college degree and falls in love with a working class architect from dubious background. I was a little disappointed that the \"backdrop of the Columbian Exposition\" promised by the back of the book resulted in little more than several meetings Lucy was required to attend as well as a couple of events glossed over by saying there were speeches and more speeches. I expected more historical content. So if you are looking for a book which has story set against the rich background of the World's Fair... you would be wise to look elsewhere. My biggest issue with the book is that after breaking their engagement, Lucy's fiance becomes a stalker, a storyline which is rather disturbing at times. Despite this, everything wraps up in a nice, beautiful bow by the end of the book.

He enters a room with Lucy and Cassandra, but does not recognize the stunning beauty as the current incarnation of the gawky 16-year-old he left behind. So Lucy decides to pretend that Cassandra is Patience Bunbury and herself Lady Worthing so that Cass can have time with Julian before he meets Penelope to (supposedly) marry her. Titled London society is just not that large for two women who are at the center of a social circle to pass themselves off as fictional people. Particularly when one is a Duchess with two different colored eyes and the other still has family in the area. I spent much of this book wanting to toss it against the wall, which is a shame because I remember enjoying The Unexpected Duchess. The last book in the series is about Jane and Garrett.

But then dad (Capital-G God) shows up and turns him mortal again so he can live a normal life with his one true love.

Maria was a seamstress at Kensington palace during WWI where she catches the eye of the crown prince. Unfortunately, her life at the palace takes a less than idyllic turn and the quilt becomes Maria's outlet. The uncovering of Maria's secret was fascinating and I liked the character of Caroline. She was believable, as were her struggles. I wish I had another 25-50 pages to bring her current journey to another crossroads, however the book was truly about Maria. Maria's story was definitely plausible and I felt awful about the way she was treated. Definitely want to pick up The Last Telegram. ...more",

Emily is invited by her cousin to help search out the lost treasure of Queen Isabelle in the Chateau de Chinon. When Henry does not arrive at the train station to meet her, she assumes he's become distracted, which is not at all out of character. In the meantime, she decides to enjoy her holiday and spends it with the motley crew who are also at the hotel. While there she learns of a second Isabelle who also left a treasure in Chinon during WWII. The story picks up pace when Emily determines that something has happened to Henry and she confesses to Paul. They work together to find out where Henry is. This book was not an action book. It was very much a book that worked because the characters were charming and realistic. I liked watching how Emily's relationships between her and Paul, Simon and Neal grew. I liked the comic relief of Thierry and Garland. My only complaint is that I would have liked the thread of the mystery to be woven into the book earlier as the resolution was a bit rushed in the last 75 pages or so of the book. ...more",

It needed to be a book read without much concentration because then flaws would become more apparent and frustrating. Ellen is a real estate lawyer in NYC. With her (literal) dying breath, Ellen's grandmother tells of a letter that she wants delivered to Chet in Beacon, ME. So off Ellen goes, letter in tow, leaving her fiance with political aspirations behind in New York. The book follows the typical plot line of girl is fish out of water. Girl meets boy who is very different from what she expects of life. Girl decides to... well. You can guess the rest ;) Everything was very compressed. There was no soul searching about what she wants out of life before the big climatic event. I don't know that I would count out reading a second book by this author, but I wish I had been dumping my brain on a beach while reading this one instead of during an average work week. ...more",

Last year I read about the Grumman Duck in Greenland, this year I follo Apparently I have a thing about WWII planes crashing in the great white north. Last year I read about the Grumman Duck in Greenland, this year I followed the story of Leon Crane who crashed in the interior of Alaska. Crane's bomber was out for a routine run to test out the feathering on the propellers when an engine stalled out and the plane crashed. Crane and one other crewmen were able to jump out of the plane, but only Crane survived. He did so by walking out of the forest to safety. It took 81 days in the Alaskan winter for him to do so. Good fortune smiled on him in that he found a cabin with a cache of supplies which allowed him to recover from the crash's aftermath and regain the feeling in his hands as well as upgrade his winter gear. The story itself is relatively simple. It's not as fleshed out as it could have been, not by fault of the author, but because Crane appears to have suffered from survivor's guilt and wouldn't talk much about his ordeal. My only other complaint about the book is that Mr. Murphy found interesting tidbits that were tangentially related to the main story and stuck them into the narrative, disrupting the flow of the book. I would have preferred these as foot/end notes or in an appendix of some kind. An interesting read, made more interesting having lived in Fairbanks for 3 years so I understood the dangers of the weather and the rough geography of the area. ...more",
            "review Sabina Carpenter has been hired to keep an eye on a young debutante who her parents suspect is carrying on a dalliance with an unsuitable young man. W Sabina Carpenter has been hired to keep an eye on a young debutante who her parents suspect is carrying on a dalliance with an unsuitable young man. While at a party, the girl appears to commit suicide and Sabina must work on clearing her name and restoring her reputation. Meanwhile, John Quincannon is attempting to find burglars who robbed Wells, Fargo so he can collect a $3000 reward. Towards the end, the two detectives find that their cases intersect. Unfortunately, that does not mean that they work together. I think the book is at its best when Sabina and John are in the same room, but that only happens for 20 pages or so. I'm guessing due to how the authors are writing the novel. Because they are never together, their dynamic is never quite fleshed out. I may be done with this series. It's lacking a sparkle that other books have and there's too many books I want to read and not enough free time during the day. ...more",
            "review Mickey Rawlings is accused of shooting the head of the IWW union in self-defense, although he knows he didn't do it. The police consider it a shut cas Mickey Rawlings is accused of shooting the head of the IWW union in self-defense, although he knows he didn't do it. The police consider it a shut case and unless Mickey can find definitive proof that someone else was involved, he won't be able to clear his name. Mickey winds up as a pawn in the battle between the baseball owners and players during the fledgling labor movement. This one was not my favorite, although it may be colored by my recent reading of The Daring Ladies of Lowell, which also covered the same subject matter. Like Mickey Rawlings himself, I have a hard time getting behind unionized baseball players when the working conditions for children were terrible. There was almost a little too much going on between the labor movement, suffrage movement and the Detroit auto-factories that no subject was scratched very deeply. However, as always, the baseball details are wonderful and Mickey is a truly delightful protagonist. ...more",

Prue is fired from the traveling variety show on the voyage from America to Eur This book started out slowly, but I was quite happy with it by the end. Prue is fired from the traveling variety show on the voyage from America to Europe. Ophelia quits her job in solidarity and to keep an eye on Prue. She finds employment for them both as servants with a newly married couple on the way to see their castle in Germany. Once there, a cottage is discovered which is supposedly Snow White's. Shortly thereafter, the owner of the castle is murdered with a poisoned apple. From here, a tangled web is woven as groups of characters seek to discover the true identity of the murderer and where Snow White is buried, if she is indeed real. I don't believe anyone in this book is who they say they are. The beauty of it is that you really aren't sure who is who until the very end. Ms. Chance does an impeccable job of gathering all the threads and pulling them together into a plausible ending. I look forward to the next one. ...more",

When she leaves This book follows an 11-year-old girl on her trip from Quincy, IL to Golden, CO as her father seeks out a better life for her family. When she leaves Quincy, her grandmother presents her with the pieces for a doll-sized Log Cabin quilt. Emmy does not enjoy quilting, but on her journey she learns that quilts bind the women of a community together, be it a town or a wagon train. The author was a bit heavy handed with some of her plot elements. The quilting conversations seemed a bit forced. I also wasn't keen on how the author presented the role of women in pioneer times as being subservient to the husband nor the abusive relationship in the wagon train. It seemed as though the author tried to dumb-down the concepts because the book is written for children, but I think they could have been handled with more finesse. ...more",

Jenny and Elijah spend much of their While full of sparkling dialogue as always, I found this book to be more lackluster than the rest of the series. Jenny and Elijah spend much of their time not finding ways to compromise even though their romantic road block is fairly easy to compromise with. Jenny is an artist at a time when women's art is under-appreciated. Elijah is commissioned to paint a portrait of two of her many nephews. The attraction is, of course, immediate. Jenny insists that Elijah cannot coexist in her dreamland where she is able to study art seriously. Love is blind I guess? Elijah clearly is able to accept Jenny the artist as evidenced by his acceptance of her opinion and his offer to have him assist in his portrait painting sessions. Still, for a Christmas romance, you can't expect much more than what this offers! ...more",
            "review Charlotte has lived in the country for most of her teenage years. Her father died in an accident and the entailed estate was left to a distant cousin. Charlotte has lived in the country for most of her teenage years. Her father died in an accident and the entailed estate was left to a distant cousin. Unbeknownst to her, she was betrothed at birth to a duke who is descended from the illegitimate son of a king. She finds this out in the middle of the night. This book was tiresome. Charlotte was written to act more like a 15-year old, but was actually 18 (probably so as not to offend modern sensibilities). Her innocence was a bit too childish for an Earl's daughter, even one who grew up in the country. The \"misunderstandings\" between Charlotte and March were annoying and there was not enough friction between the characters to make it interesting read. I couldn't bring myself to abandon the first two books of 2014, which is probably why I didn't give up on it. ...more",

Combine some long-rooted animosity It seems to me that the world around 1800 was ready for a change and it truly didn't matter who was on the throne. Combine some long-rooted animosity against Austria and a weak monarch and you have a recipe for revolution. It occurs to me that Marie Antoinette really suffered from a lack of a decent PR department! The book was very interesting, I like the view that Marie Antoinette was not the heinous person history alludes that she was. I had no idea about her frustrations about not being a mother at an early age. The pacing was a bit uneven, at times I felt as though the plot was plodding and other times moved at a brisk clip. I imagine part of the problem is that this book is a bridge between the introduction and the final ending which we all know occurs and I found myself biding my time until the revolution begins. Looking forward to The Last October Sky. ...more",

Jules gets herself hired as a teacher so she can uncover what is wrong at the school and spring her sister. And so begins 400 pages of convenient events and shallow characters. There's much navel gazing and wondering the same thing over and over and over. The secondary characters were not fleshed out hardly at all and became integral to the end of the book. All in all, it was a frustrating read because it could have been so much better with a little more work and 100 fewer pages.

I was completely hooked. I HAD to know what they found on the moon and why it could possibly have been that controversial that it needed to be kept quiet. I liked the way the narrative switched between three points of view. It kept the story clicking along and was a smart way to slowly unfold all of the details surrounding the secret moon missions. I wonder if there was a particular author in charge of each point of view... and if not, how they worked the collaboration. I am a McDevitt fan, but I do not believe I have read anything by Resnick.
