The wafer 134 is attached to a carrier frame 142 which may then be mated with PCB 132. Probe pins 136 are then aligned and brought into contact and a uniform compressing force is exerted across both the PCB 132 and the wafer 134, thereby maintaining proper contact between them. Because the connection of probe pins with other probe pins is performed external to the wafer, the configuration of probe pins 136 remains constant for the particular wafer layout regardless of which dice are nonfunctional. The nonfunctional dice are open-circuited from the remaining bused dice by the isolation process as described with respect to FIG. 5. Further, since bus coupling occurs at the bumped contact, the isolation region may be located anywhere along the redistribution circuit which would result in an open circuit between the bumped contact and the die contact. illustrates an alternate embodiment for coupling the individual components together for wafer-level testing through the use of busing external to the wafer. In the present embodiment, the entire wafer is loaded into a fixture 130, the cross-section of which is seen in FIG. 7. In general, the fixture serves to bring a printed circuit",
