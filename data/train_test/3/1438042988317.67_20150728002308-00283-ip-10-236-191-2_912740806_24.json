            "apsu has the ap police. the ap police are everywhere you look. there are also help buttons around campus that are pretty close together. there is a very small crime rate at apsu.",
            "apsu is perfect for determined students who are willing to truly learn and not hope to walk away with a degree.",
            "there is a mudbowl every year. where groups or sororities or fraternities come together as a team and play games in the mud.",
            "as long as you put forth the effort in a class, you will learn as much as if you were in an ivy league school, for 1/4 of the cost. the classes can go very in depth and the teachers are extremely knowledgeable.",
            "there are tons of organizations and fun things to take place in. there are always fun people to meet and the close-by down town area is wonderful and full of things to do.",
            "the cafe has an all you can eat, as close to homemade and southern as you can get, buffet for all three meals. the other places to get food are scattered in other buildings. there are kiosks and coffee shops. we have a chic-fil-a, papa johns, subway and are about to open our starbucks in our library.",
            "the dorms are nice and clean. there are a new set of dorms that were put in at the beginning of the fall 2011 semester and they are very nice. apsu is in the process of tearing down the older dorms and putting in newer ones. there are also many different dormitories to choose from both directly on campus and some right behind it.",
            "classes require a lot of time and effort put into them. students should spend double the credit hours outside of class studying or working on anything to help further comprehend the material. all professors are willing to take the time to explain something that you may not understand.",
            "students wishing to attend apsu should see if their major is offered and see if there are any better options are available. apsu is well known for its nursing program (which is extremely prestigious and difficult to get in to), any science major is well regarded in the country, and it also has a very good education program. if you're looking for a party school and are not a serious student, i would suggest a different school.",
            "austin peay state university is focused on helping their students succeed in everything they do. the staff is friendly and always helpful with any question, concern, or problem. the students are willing to help others and are at the school to work and earn a degree, not just to party and have a good time."

They have about 1300 new dorms built in the last year or two., 158780=The polar plunge is done around December or January I think. It's where student jump into the freezing cold pool and just have fun. You also get a free shirt., 67355=Get involved! I don't even start until August 29th and I am already an active part of three organizations here on campus! You won't get the full experience unless you're involved., 17353=Turn in your application as early as possible. Fill out financial aid forms as fast as possible, the money does run out. If possible live on campus, it makes the early class that you are likely to have to get a lot easier, if you don't have to get up extra early to drive to school. If you must drive arrive sometime between 6:30-7:10 for morning classes, and 12:30-1:10 for afternoon classes if want a decent parking spot. If you have a dorm room that is kind of out of the way, or if you are a commuter student I would try to get a locker, there are some lockers on the first floor of the MUC and there are some for Art students in Trahern. There may be more but I don't know where they are., 98540=the dorms are nice and clean. there are a new set of dorms that were put in at the beginning of the fall 2011 semester and they are very nice. apsu is in the process of tearing down the older dorms and putting in newer ones. there are also many different dormitories to choose from both directly on campus and some right behind it., 378032=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 217722=APSU has a fun little event every year at the end of homecoming week called Mud Bowl. They make a mud pit on campus, and teams of students play either volleyball or tug-o-war in the mud. We also do Polar Plunge in January. President Hall is known to jump in with students in his suit and tie. Sign up early if you want a t-shirt, they go fast.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck APSU is very affordable if you live in state and are just taking regular classes with no extra fees you need about 4000 a semester to get a nice refund check and get everything paid for. Not all the courses require the newest versions of books or they dont require books at all ,so that helps out alot. The school bookstore is expensive but you can rent books from them for a discounted price at the beginning of every semester. Or you can visit the local bookstore Studymasters and get the same books for even cheaper and campus still approves them. APSU has a lot of activities that students can do for free through out the year mainly in the fall but free is free. Am enjoying being here I love walking around campus I meet a new person everyday. Its not to big but its not to small. Especially when football season starts there is the Mudbowl event where everyone comes and plays vollyball in the mud ALOT of fun and the frat and sor step show in the plaza that hundreds of students attend. APSU is where it is at I have a blast everyday Am learning a lot Right now im taking my",
