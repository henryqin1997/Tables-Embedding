After vulcanization, the glove 10 is removed from the oven and may be inspected over a light tube. Areas that the spray coating did not sufficiently cover are easily seen over such a light, and can be marked for re-spraying and vulcanization. Alternatively, a light tube might be added to the mounting frame 30 so that areas of insufficient coverage can be detected before the glove proceeds to vulcanization of the coating 22. After the preliminary drying, the glove 10 is slowly deflated (for example, over a period of 20 to 30 seconds) and removed from the mounting fixture 30. Preferably, the glove is then internally supported by a vertical mandrel and placed into an oven for further drying and vulcanization of the fluoroelastomeric coating 22. For example, the glove may be dried and vulcanized in a 212 degree Fahrenheit oven for one hour. The required time and temperature may of course vary. For example, better cross-linking may be obtained by using a higher temperature, but care must be taken to avoid damaging the polymeric glove base 20. When the glove base is made of acrylonitrile, one-hour vulcanization of the fluoroelastomer coating may be performed at a temperature as high as 260 degrees Fahrenheit. After the final coating is sprayed, the glove 10 remains",
