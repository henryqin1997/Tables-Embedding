According to Football Outsiders, the Eagles had the 27th-ranked punt return unit in the NFL. Of course, Jackson has admitted that his contract situation contributed to struggles in all aspects of his game last year. With a new deal in hand, he\u2019s been very good as a receiver in 2012., 5208=Sheil Kapadia \u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0 September 24, 2012 at 7:20 am \u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0 2 Comments, 14003=Sheil Kapadia \u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0 September 25, 2012 at 9:03 am \u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0 8 Comments, 47016=\u201cYou never know,\u201d April said. \u201cYou may get your wish this week. You may get it in two weeks, you never know. But he\u2019s always ready to go.\u201d, 51985=The other notable part about Johnson sitting is that it opens up the punt returner spot. It seems likely that DeSean Jackson would be back there, something that Bobby April talked about earlier this week.\u00a0Mardy Gilard\u00a0could get a shot too. Johnson had fielded nine fair catches and failed to notch a return longer than 13 yards in the first five games., 46862=The sense I get is that Johnson will continue to return punts. And Jackson is an option in certain situations. For example, in a tie game with 16 seconds on the clock, you might see him back there. But otherwise, it\u2019s going to be Johnson. Either way, April said it\u2019s not usually his call., 46409=Meanwhile, the Eagles haven\u2019t been much better on kickoff returns with Brandon Boykin. They\u2019re averaging 19.6 yards per return, which ranks 30th. And the Birds are one of three teams (the Patriots and Cowboys the others) without a kickoff return of at least 30 yards. April seemed to think the problem has more to do with the blocking than Boykin., 46029=\u201cI think the blocking and our timing and our setting the formation properly has been more a factor than his innate ability,\u201d April said. \u201cI do think we\u2019re improving by increments. There needs to be greater increments of improvement. But I do think there is improvement. I do think the arrow is pointing in the right direction.\u201d, 45686=If the return game is ever going to get on track, this would be the week. Football Outsiders has the Lions\u2019 special-teams unit ranked dead-last in the league (the Eagles are 28th). Detroit has the worst kickoff coverage unit and the second-to-worst punt coverage unit. A couple weeks ago, the Lions became the first team since at least 1940 to allow a punt return for a touchdown and a kickoff return for a touchdown in consecutive weeks, according to Elias., 45136=\u201cMy defense of those two guys [Boykin and Johnson], statistically, is not very strong,\u201d April said. \u201cBut we have a lot of faith in them. I have a lot of faith in them. \u2026 I think these guys\u2019 talent will shine.\u201d}",

Johnson lined up in the backfield and looked good, picking up 6 yards and a first down on a run around the left end in the first. He only had one ball thrown his way, but it was a 13-yard gain where he beat 2011 first-round pick Jimmy Smith., 43693=Established 1908 Philadelphia Magazine, 15534=Brent Celek \u2013 Guess which tight end led the NFL in yards after the catch last season. Rob Gronkowski? Nope. Jimmy Graham? Try again. It was Celek. And that ability was on display once again Sunday. Celek had a career game with eight catches for 157 yards. And by my count, 67 of those yards were after the catch. The first defender is rarely able to bring him down, and Celek has been a weapon in the Eagles\u2019 passing game since the sixth game of the 2011 season. Great effort on a 19-yard catch and run on 3rd-and-20 in the first. Later, he almost had his helmet knocked off by\u00a0Bernard Pollard, but held on to the ball as the crowd went nuts. In general, I\u2019m anti-hurdle, but Celek\u2019s leap over\u00a0Ed Reed\u00a0worked perfectly. And his teammates loved it. If you watch the replay, check out their reaction on the sideline. Celek stood up and took the blame for Vick\u2019s second interception. He\u2019s the kind of teammate who would do that regardless, but if you watch the replay, Celek had Lewis on his left, so Vick had to throw it high to the other side. The ball bounced off of Celek\u2019s hand and was picked off by Reed. Celek had a lot of good moments as a blocker, mixed in with a couple miscues. Let\u2019s start with the good. Nice job in protection on Vick\u2019s 10-yard completion to Jackson. Nice block on McCoy\u2019s 7-yard run. Good job on McCoy\u2019s 9-yard run in the third. And again on McCoy\u2019s 5-yard run. Celek did a good job on McCoy\u2019s 6-yard run as well. On the flip side, he missed his block on a Havili run that went for no gain. There was confusion in the third as safety\u00a0James Ihedigbo\u00a0went right past him and dropped McCoy for a 2-yard loss. Overall, outstanding game for Celek., 6870=Tim McManus \u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0 September 21, 2012 at 12:02 pm \u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0 Comment Now, 10017=Sheil Kapadia \u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0 September 18, 2012 at 8:53 am \u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0 Comment Now}",

    "textBeforeTable": "As for the tight ends, Brent Celek had two catches for 36 yards on six targets, including one 34-yard gain. Harbor saw his least playing time of the season and was not targeted. Johnson finished with five catches for 84 yards. He was the team\u2019s most targeted receiver (11). Jackson had three catches for 43 yards, but needed 10 targets to compile those numbers. Avant had three catches for 38 yards, and Gilyard was targeted once. Considering that the Eagles were without Jeremy Maclin and Riley Cooper, the guess going in was that perhaps they\u2019d play with more two tight-end sets. Brent Celek and Clay Harbor were off to good starts in the first two weeks. But that was not the case. As you can see, the Eagles played with three wide receivers or more on 88 percent of their snaps. We\u2019ll get a better idea when the All-22 tape comes out, but it sure seemed like there were several occasions where Michael Vick couldn\u2019t find anyone open. 17% 11 Clay Harbor 84% 54 Brent Celek 9% 6 Mardy Gilyard 88% 56 Damaris Johnson 88% 56 Jason Avant 98% 63 DeSean Jackson Snap %",
    "textAfterTable": "We had speculated last week about Graham seeing a bump in playing time, and he did, taking snaps away from Hunt. Graham played 17 snaps to Hunt\u2019s 12. Graham\u2019s snaps have gone up in each of the first three weeks \u2013 from four to nine to 17. Landri saw the most snaps of any defensive lineman. Cox left the game for a period in the first half because of migraines. Jenkins started, but saw fewer snaps than Cox. It looks like that will probably be the case most weeks. Babin had 1.5 sacks. Tapp, Cole and Graham each had 0.5. \u00a0 Overall Snaps Snap % DeMeco Ryans 62 100% Mychal Kendricks 55 89% Brian Rolle 16 26% Akeem Jordan 14 23% Ryans was once again an every-down player, staying on the field for all 62 defensive snaps. As far as I could tell, Kendricks only came out in dime situations. Jordan started the game at WILL, but suffered a hamstring injury and was replaced by Rolle. \u00a0 Overall Snaps",
