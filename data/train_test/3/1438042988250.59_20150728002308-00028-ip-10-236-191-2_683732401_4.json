The ATPI was released for the first time in March 2004., 17059=BTS, a part of the Research and Innovative Technology Administration, reported that the fare index rose 11.5 percent in the second quarter of 2006 from the second quarter of 2005 (Table 1), the biggest year-to-year rise since the start of the index numbers in 1995 (1995 1st quarter = 100)., 29362=(U.S.-Origin Itineraries, First Quarter 1995 = 100), 20320=Additional information about the ATPI, including indexes for foreign-origin itineraries and the top 85 air travel markets based on originating passengers, can be found on the BTS website, http://www.bts.gov/xml/atpi/src/index.xml. \u00a0The third-quarter 2006 ATPI will be released on Jan. 24, 2007., 25044=(Second Quarter to Second Quarter, First Quarter 1995 = 100), 31860=(Air Travel Price Index Percent Change, Second Quarter 2005 to Second Quarter 2006, First Quarter 1995 = 100), 39933=(Air Travel Price Index Percent Change, Second Quarter 1995 to Second Quarter 2006, First Quarter 1995 = 100), 19488=The ATPI in the second quarter of 2006 was 19.3 percent above the level of the second quarter of 1995 (Table 1).\u00a0 The second-quarter 2006 index rose 5.3 percent from the first quarter 2005 level, the sixth consecutive increase from the previous quarter (Table 3), and the second highest quarter-to-quarter rise for the eleven years of the index.

Quarter-to-quarter changes may be affected by seasonal factors., 51764=The index uses the first quarter of 1995 as the reference point (expressed as the number 100) against which all subsequent quarterly prices are measured. ATPI values below 100 represent overall \u201ccost of flying\u201d levels less than those in the first quarter of 1995, while values above 100 represent cost of flying levels that exceed those of the first quarter of 1995. ATPI levels can be used to compute percentage changes in overall fare costs between any two quarters in an ATPI series.}",
