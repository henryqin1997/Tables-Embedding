            "There are many events going on around campus and there are always people hanging out in the dorms. Most people can find places to eat off campus and can go to the mall if they want to.",
            "The cafeteria is all-you-can-eat style. The food is prepared well and the options are delicious.",
            "The suites are really nice and comfortable. The 2 person dorms are spacious with a lot of people to meet around you.",
            "Some classes are harder than others, but if you keep on top of your work and go to class, they will be easy to finish and pass.",
            "I would advise all incoming freshman to get out of your dorm on the first night. Be friendly with people and they will be friendly back. Everyone is looking to be someones friend. Also, pay attention in classes and do you work as well as you can so that you can have fun and join clubs after you have finished.",
            "California Lutheran University is a great private university that offers a lot of help and advice for students looking to graduate in four years with a undergraduate degree. It is in the nice, quiet community of Thousand Oaks and is a short drive away from the beach or Los Angeles. I would recommend California Lutheran University to anyone who wants a great education in a quiet, private school."

Professors here really care about your education and will get to know you on a personal level if you are willing. I have some of my professors numbers that are in my major and allow me to contact them if need be. The size of the classes are small with a ratio of about 17:1 (17 students to 1 professor)., 89404=there are many traditions that are unusual here, but one i think is the greatest is the undie run. mid to late october, everyone strips to their undies, gives the clothes they had on to charity, and then goes on a run around campus. it's all about the charity! there's a lot of cool locations that are around the campus, you just have to find them!, 172126=As of right now, our cafeteria is very sub-par. However, we do have a cafe called the Centrum, which is very convenient because you can get all kinds of food to go. We are in the process of building a new dining commons which is going to be VERY nice! It will be finished in 2015., 51305=Set in sunny Southern California where it is close to Malibu Beach, Six Flags, and Disneyland, as well as Downtown Hollywood. The student:professor ratio is generally 20:1 so the professors can offer one on one help and get to know the students' personalities and learning styles. Has extremely competitive Chemistry, Biology, and Communications programs with opportunities for internships at local hospitals and media companies in Hollywood., 162552=The food and dining is okay right now, however, in 2014 a new dinning commons is coming and it will all be updates and better., 52417=There is a cafe called the Centrum that does breakfast specialties, and provides salads, sandwiches, pizzas, and hamburgers for lunch and dinner. As of September 2014, there will be a brand new Cafeteria on campus with all kinds of food, and a coffee shop., 220302=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 126389=The dining options the school has now aren't horrible, but it does get redundant throughout the year. Cal Lu offers a traditional dining hall, Centrum (cafe style), Jamba Juice, Mogen Market (open 5pm-12am), and a small kiosk. Cal Lu is currently starting to rebuild a new two floor dining hall that is scheduled to be finished after summer 2014., 18155=California Lutheran can be expensive, but they are willing to help you. With numerous donors and out side sources I believe its over 85% of students that get some sort of financial aid. CLU already provides $19 million a year in financial aid to students, but in 2009-2010 it plans to increase the amount of scholarship money available to current students to help them meet educational expenses during the recession. source: http://www.callutheran.edu/news/news_detail.php?story_id=5453}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students They like kids who are service-oriented (Boys Scouts, etc.) not just with high grades. Go to the interview, if you get invited, and share something great you have done to help your community. Bang for the buck I got a great scholarship and financial aid. They accommodated my parent's sudden loss of income with lots of help with finances! They go out of their way to help you afford the school. Am enjoying being here The staff and helpful upperclassmen were so helpful from day 1. They act like they want YOU on campus, not just your money!! They provide lots of support for freshman so they don't fail. You get a student and academic adviser to help you through the first year! Am learning a lot How could you NOT learn here, there are so few students per class and the professors know you!!I was taking an easy class in my major and the professor found out I was bored, so he offered me a chance to audit an upper level class in something I was interested in!
