The student recreation center also has a variety of classes offered to students such as hip hop hustle, belly dancing, spinning, boxing, and even rock wall climbing. UC also hold a spring concert every year for students that headline artists such as Juicy J, T-Pain, Kendrick Lamar, Big Boi and many others., 760319=Rated the #1 best value in 2013 for a reason!, 860040=Although Cincinnati has a reputation for being dangerous, that is not the case on campus. I've always felt completely safe on campus, even at night. The UCPD has done an excellent job of keeping an eye out, but students have to be smart too. You shouldn't go wandering about on Jefferson by yourself carrying all of your valuables at 3:00 in the morning. Be smart, and stay on campus when in doubt, and you will be very safe!, 801796=When I went to the campus I was able to tour the entire campus and dorm. Which I chose to live in when I arrive in the fall of 2014. an unusual location on campus to me was how the dorms are right by the class building their not set apart. So making a choice of living is easy for the students., 510164=The greek Life is about 1000 to 2500 students so about 5%-8% of the total student population and the greek houses are right next to campus., 368939=There's things to do in there area. Be smart around the neighborhood. Don't wander around drunk at 3:00 in the morning., 735=Use office hours, study groups, learning communities, and learning center hours to your advantage. There are tons of resources at your disposal when you are a student at UC. Apply early -- even if you're not sure, because applying before December guarantees you a $2000/year scholarship. Go on a campus visit, but also wonder around campus on your own (during the school day) and try to drop in a couple classes (discreetly of course)., 42600=I am currently a college freshman at the University of Cincinnati for the 2010-2011 school year. At UC, I am studying interior design in the School of Design, Architecture, Art and Planning, also known as DAAP. The interior design program is ranked nationally as the best interior design school in the United States. As a result, I am learning leaps and bounds of new information and new techniques in this program. I am learning to think outside the box, to solve different kinds of problems, and to develop my creativity to a whole new level., 173368=I'm born and raised a UC Bearcat fan so I know I'll enjoy being here. Everyone is so energetic and so passionate about everything they're involved in. It's been my dream to march with the UC marching band., 575608=There is the nearly naked mile run every October. The football field is very unusual because it is one of the only fields in the nation that is totally accessible during the day and night to any student at any time because it sits directly in the heart of campus. You can use the stadium at anytime., 896511=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 243809=try your best to get your applications in before december so you are eligible for more of the scholarship opportunities that aren't available later in the registration process.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Be forward. Make friends join an learning community where you will be placed with other people with the same schedule as you. Form groups to study with. My grades went up when I studied with other people. Because it means I get to teach them which ends up as practice for me and they can help me if I don't get something or I'm on the wrong track. If you are on a science based major (engineering for example) take some AP and get them out of the way. the transition from highschool to a tough college will most likely rattle a new student. The first few quarters will be lighter if you take AP. If you aren't sure where to go, take some classes and find out what you want to do. Even if it seems like junk classes and a waste of 10,000 (with books ect.) you can build your GPA, get Grants, get scholarships, and then get into a College you want to be in for sure. So 10,000 will probably turn into 3,000 if you do well. Bang for the buck I won't say it's cheap, but it's definitely not bad. 10,000 (books ect,). Books are something that you should ask around for. Many upper classmen are trying to get rid of their old books and will sell theirs for absurdly low",
