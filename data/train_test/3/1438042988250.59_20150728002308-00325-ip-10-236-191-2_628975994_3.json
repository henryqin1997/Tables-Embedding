He played at Tennessee for General Neyland, but he wasn\u2019t satisfied just to let places like Alabama and Tennessee do their thing while everyone else laid down because they were supposed to. He was attracted to the Florida Gators program because it had never done much, and he wanted to shake things up. He also wanted to throw the ball and see what happened. It\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t want to run it all the time and play defense like everyone else. He just knew Florida couldn\u2019t. He wanted to do something different. I liked the sound of that.\u201d [\u2026], 24320=Posted by Adam Silverstein | Posted in Football, Other | August 18, 2012}",
