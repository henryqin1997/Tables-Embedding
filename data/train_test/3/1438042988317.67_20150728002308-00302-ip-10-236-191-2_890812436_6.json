            "It's good for those who want to be a big fish in a small crowd. It's a small campus, but their are many opportunities to stand out and take charge.",
            "Pick the school that's right for you. It's a big decision, but have fun with it!",
            "Anyone can make it worth their while if you take what you put into it. If you don't put anything into it, than you probably wont take what you want. However if you do what needs to get done, you will have many opportunities to have a great time and make it your most memorable years!",
            "I love being here. I only live 15 minutes away, but I live in the dorms and get involved in everything. In the first couple of months here I turned Iona into more than just a school, I made it my home.",
            "There are a wide variety of classes and generally multiple sections of classes. It is easy to cater your schedule t take classes that interest you along with a teacher that best fits you. You may end up with the one class with the one teacher you don't want to have, but such is the story of every college."

Tips for prospective students If you do come to Iona start signing up for clubs and events around campus. Get involved and get to know a lot of people. This is a very small campus and you're bound to find the group of people you enjoy hanging out with. Bang for the buck Iona is quite expensive, but they offer plenty of financial aid for students. Am enjoying being here There are plenty of activities in which you may get involved in. For example this Catholic school has a Baptist Society even!",
