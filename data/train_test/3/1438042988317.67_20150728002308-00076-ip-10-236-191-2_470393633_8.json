In particular the invention is not restricted to the GSM system, but is equally applicable in systems in which the telephone operates with a removable SIM. The realization of the SMS is an optional function so it is not necessarily included in all mobile telephones 1. Nevertheless, any type approved mobile telephone 1 can be coupled to data adapter 2 in accordance with the invention, thus providing a data service facility. The air interface of mobile telephone 1 is also standardized. If it is required to transmit data messages, mobile telephone 1 that adheres to the standard must be able to transmit Short Messages stored in the SIM module. Correspondingly, if one wants to receive data messages, mobile telephone 1 that adheres to the standard must be able to receive Short Messages that can be stored in the SIM module. Mechanical limitations and the length of the cable must not cause problems. External data interface 8 of data adapter 2 may be, for instance, a TTL level output comprising a provision to transfer an 8-bit byte in a parallel form. Alternatively, the external data interface 8 may be, for instance, a serial interface in accordance with the RS232 standard with adjustable data rates. A 7-bit character code",
