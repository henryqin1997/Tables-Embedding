    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Other embodiments of this invention include on-line processing of historical motion data to generate the TCP estimates, off-line processing of motion data which results from pre-processing robot program information. The preferred embodiment of the present invention generates a process parameter or output signal which is based upon and is proportional to the estimated TCP speed estimate value through on-line processing of real-time motion data. The method uses a positive value of Tst which is equal to the equipment delay time of application processing equipment being used. The resulting TCP speed parameter is then used as a control input for the application process control system. In the case of a dispensing application, the dispensing flow rate can then be adjusted to compensate for estimated future changes of the TCP speed. The present invention, therefore, uses the concept of determining the amount of Cartesian axis acceleration in effect at any given time as a percentage of command velocity for each motion segment for the desired time. The vector sum of these scaled Cartesian velocities is the estimated robot Cartesian velocity. The magnitude of this vector is the TCP speed estimate, depicted as line 60 of FIG. 2. FIGS. 8a-8c show the relationship between the corresponding programmed, actual, and estimated TCP speed profiles. The value of Tst used in FIG. 8C is positive. A positive value of Tst indicates the estimated TCP speed represents a prediction of future TCP",
