Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 30070=peric, Rizzo has, for all intents and purposes, running the draft for the last few years. 2007 was the first year, I believe.I agree with Danny Espinoza and Derek Norris. They've shown promise in A ball and over the next few years could develop nicely. Too early to tell.Strasburg doesn't count. His expectations are already through the roof. You also can't put Storen in there. Maybe he will pan out, but the deck is stacked heavily against him. The Nationals have much much bigger needs than RP.Lannan and Stammen were both drafted in '95. I really like Lannan as 3-4 starter, and some day hopefully that will be his role. I'm missing why Stammen is being considered for the rotation. Lack of warm bodies, I guess. Desmond was drafted by the Expos not the Nationals.That leaves Jordan Zimmerman. I'm not meaning to deride Rizzo in criticizing his draft record. My point is that it is really hard to build solely through the draft, and it really helps if you string together several terrible years in a row and draft like the Devil Rays. While the Nationals want people to get excited about their young players, the fact is that there are very few to get excited about despite the fact that we are in Year 3 or 4 of The Plan.}",
