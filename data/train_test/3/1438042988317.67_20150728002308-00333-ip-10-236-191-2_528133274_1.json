According to the NASCAR record book, both had 84 victories (behind Richard Petty's 200 and David Pearson's 105). At the start of the 2004 season, however, those records were altered. Allison was awarded an 85th win, leaving him alone in third and dropping Waltrip to fourth. Allison had long argued that decades ago he won a race for which he was never credited. There was a dispute over whether the race Allison won was, at the time, part of NASCAR's official premier series [he won in a Mustang]. Last year NASCAR finally decided in Allison's favor. Waltrip still holds the distinction as the winningest driver in NASCAR's modern era (1972-present), during which time all of his 84 victories came. Second is Dale Earnhardt (76) followed by Jeff Gordon and Cale Yarborough (69 each), Petty (60) and Allison (55). Waltrip is preparing for his fifth season as a Fox Sports racing commentator. He begins his duties during next month's Daytona SpeedWeeks.(Tennessean)(1-5-2005) UPDATE: from a DW Q&A column at FoxSports.com: Linda from Manassas, Va.: I just read where NASCAR, after reviewing the situation, has given Bobby Allison a win he had in a Mustang. Wonder if NASCAR will ever \"review the situation\" and give you the win at North Wilkesboro that they gave to Brett Bodine?! [no idea what that one is about??] DW's Answer: \"I heard through the grapevine \ufffd through Jayski actually \ufffd that NASCAR had revised the results after 30 years and given Bobby Allison credit for some race that he won in a Mustang. No one has called me and told me anything about it, not that they necessarily would. A Mustang has never been a Cup car so I don't know if that change is official or not. If it is, it would be one of those things that make you go \"Hmmm.\"(FoxSports), been told by sources that Bobby Allison also had not heard about the win being added.(1-12-2005), 13542=Most wins in a season by a first time champ since 1990: Most cup wins in season of 1st title, since 1990 Season Driver Wins 1995 Jeff Gordon 7 2012 Brad Keselowski 5 2006 Jimmie Johnson 5 2000 Bobby Labonte 4 1999 Dale Jarrett 4 2004 Kurt Busch 3 2002 Tony Stewart 3 The All-Time record is David Pearson, who won 15 races during his first championship season of 1966 (ESPN Stats)(11-18-2012), 19236=Owners with the current streak of consecutive seasons with at least one win a year thru 2012 and need a win in 2013 to extend that streak: [Team, Season Streak, Wins during streak, Years of streak] Penske Racing, 22, 66, 1991 - 2012 Stewart-Hass Racing, 4, 17, 2009 - 2012 Richard Petty Motorsports, 2, 2, 2011 - 2012 Michael Waltrip Racing, 1, 3, 2012, 12023=Kyle Busch win record in three series: #18-Kyle Busch had 24 victories across NASCAR's three national series in 2010, a record, breaking his own record he set in 2008 when he had 21.

Darrell Waltrip's place in the NASCAR record book has shifted again. The record for all-time victories will be revised to put the Franklin resident back in a third-place tie with Bobby Allison at 84 wins apiece, NASCAR Vice President Jim Hunter said. Hunter said a ''computer glitch'' resulted in a change to the records last year that awarded Allison one more win than Waltrip. ''As long as they don't take any wins away from me, I don't care,'' Waltrip said yesterday at the NASCAR Nextel Media Tour. Both remain behind Richard Petty (200 wins) and David Pearson (105). Allison for decades has claimed that he owned a 1971 victory at North Wilkesboro, N.C., for which he was never credited. NASCAR had ruled that win didn't qualify as a victory in what was then the Grand National Series [now Nextel Cup]. Said racing historian Bob Moore: ''Bobby was driving a Mustang in what was then the Grand American Series. NASCAR needed to fill out the field at North Wilkesboro that day and invited him to enter the car in its Grand National race. After Bobby won the race he was told it didn't count as a Grand National win.'' Allison appeared to have won the argument. Last year NASCAR's media update book listed Allison with 85 wins and Waltrip with 84. ''There had been some discussion with NASCAR about changing the record,'' Moore said. ''Apparently the editor of the update book thought a decision had been made to give Bobby the win and printed the revised record.''(Tennessean)(1-26-2005), 16090=Drivers with the All-Time streak of consecutive seasons with at least one win a year: # of seasons, driver, years of streak 18, Richard Petty, 1960-1977 17, David Pearson, 1964-1980 16, Ricky Rudd, 1983-1998 16, Rusty Wallace, 1986-2001 15, Darrell Waltrip, 1975-1989 15, Dale Earnhardt, 1982-1996 14, Tony Stewart, 1999-2012 14.
