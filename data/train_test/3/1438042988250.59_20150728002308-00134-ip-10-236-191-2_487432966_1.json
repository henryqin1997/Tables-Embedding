I'm definitely interested in Oscar Wao based on the author's writing but this was just a little vulgar and not quite my style.

While I understand this is fictionalized, and it could be somewhat sensationalized, the undertones of the book about the division of race is hard to ignore. I cannot believe that only 50 years ago that extremist mentality existed. I suppose it is easier to believe now that the same mentality has not evolved in certain areas of the US. All of that = this book is important. While not all fact, the story told here should be recognized by American Citizens as a general reflection of US history. I'd say the book wrapped up a bit too quickly for me and didn't love the ending, but I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could. ...more",
