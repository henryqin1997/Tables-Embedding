    "textBeforeTable": "With those factors in mind, let's take a closer look at Red Robin. Dividends. Investors are demanding tangible proof of profits, and there's nothing more tangible than getting a check every three months. Companies with solid dividends and strong commitments to increasing payouts treat shareholders well. Valuation. You can't afford to pay too much for even the best companies. Earnings multiples are simple, but using normalized figures gives you a sense of how valuation fits into a longer-term context. Money-making opportunities. Companies need to be able to turn their resources into profitable business opportunities. Return on equity helps measure how well a company is finding those opportunities. Balance sheet. Debt-laden companies have banks and bondholders competing with shareholders for management's attention. Companies with strong balance sheets don't have to worry about the distraction of debt. Margins. Higher sales don't mean anything if a company can't turn them into profits. Strong margins ensure a company is able to turn revenue into profit. Growth. Expanding businesses show healthy revenue growth. While past growth is no guarantee that revenue will keep rising, it's certainly a better sign than a stagnant top line.

As far as my taste buds are concerned, Red Robin was a perfect eatery for a long time, so it's surprising to discover the stock posting the first goose egg since I started looking for the perfect stock three months ago. But given some of the company's recent troubles, it's not surprising to see the burger maven cooking up a low score. It's no secret that the restaurant business is difficult. Look at competitors like Darden's (NYSE: DRI\u00a0\u00a0) Olive Garden and Red Lobster or Brinker's (NYSE: EAT\u00a0\u00a0) Chili's and Macaroni Grill, and you'll see the same low margins, weak balance sheets, and slow growth. A big part of the problem has come from cash-strapped consumers, who moved down during the recession, boosting prospects for McDonald's (NYSE: MCD\u00a0\u00a0) and Chipotle (NYSE: CMG\u00a0\u00a0) at the expense of more expensive eat-in restaurants like Red Robin. But Red Robin has had its own particular trials. Management decided to try to grow at any price, and it backfired on the company. Shares lost two-thirds of their value from their 2005 all-time high.
