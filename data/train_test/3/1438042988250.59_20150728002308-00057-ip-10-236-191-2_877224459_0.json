    "textBeforeTable": "About Color and Availability - pictured above are some available Champion colors. This model may not be available in all of these colors. Likewise, each weight range may not be available in all colors. Therefore we ask you to list and prioritize your color preferences and to give us guidance if the color or weight range you want happens to not be available. Feel free to contact us if you need more specific info. About Blizzard Champion plastic - it is Champion plastic with thousands of micro bubbles incorporated into it resulting in weights as low as 130 grams. It provides almost the same flight characteristics and superior durability as Champion models in heavier weights. They fly farther with less effort. Discs weighing less than 140 grams float in water. Speed 11, Glide 5, Turn -1, Fade 3 It is a great choice for long distance with great control, long hyzers, and tailwind drives. The Innova Blizzard Champion Wraith is a slightly overstable distance driver. It is a stable flyer that performs predictably well in the wind with speed, glide and accuracy. Performs remarkably well at full speed and less than full speed. It can provide great distance for players of all skill levels. The Wraith is an excellent down wind driver and sidearm disc. The Star Wraith is endorsed by 12-time World Champion and Hall of Famer, Ken Climo. 21.2 cm diameter. Reviews (0) Description",
    "textAfterTable": "\"With a little to no break-in time, the Pro Wraith gives me a wonderful combination of distance and control. I will often forego a faster disc in favor of the combination of speed, glide and accuracy of the Pro Wraith.\" - Gregg Hosfeld \"I love the Wraith because it can handle any inconsistency in form, while still producing an accurate and far shot.\" - Hannah Leatherman If you are looking for a disc that has more Fade, try the TeeRex more Turn, try the Archon more Glide, try the Mamba \u00a0 Other Speed 11 discs include the Archon, Krait, Mamba, Max and TeeRex.
