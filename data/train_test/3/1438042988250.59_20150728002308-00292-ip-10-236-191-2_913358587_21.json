            "Unfortunately, the city of Poughkeepsie could have better crime ratings. Because of this, security is offered to escort students to and from the parking lots of desired. I personally never felt my safety was at risk at DCC. Overall, it's a pretty busy place, and its hard to find yourself alone.",
            "There are lots of clubs to choose from. My favorite was the literary magazine, which did a great job showcasing the work of writers and artists at dutchess. The student art gallery also hosts events that are great resume builders for young artists.",
            "Students who did poorly in high school or have financial troubles can benefit from DCC. They have the lowest tuition in NY state, and programs that help alleviate the cost.",
            "In Washington Hall, the arts and science building, you can climb all the way up to the top tower where you can see all of Poughkeepsie and Hyde Park. Surprisingly few students know about it.",
            "Summer classes are really inexpensive and allow you to knock out humanities and some electives in five or seven week periods. Using this can help you bang out your degree in less time.",
            "Dutchess is within a few minutes of the rail trail and the Walkway of the Hudson. There is a weight room open almost all the time for student use. Student Activities host events in the cafeteria very frequently and there are lots of clubs and day trips to choose from.",
            "Food at school was surprisingly good and there was a lot of variety. I found it to be a little pricey, but there are a lot of other options for food within a few minutes of campus.",
            "I did not experience the dorms at dutchess as they were just being built my last semester.",
            "I found most classes to be easy if you simply did the homework and followed along. I had few classes that assigned outrageous projects or maintained a huge workload all semester. Most teachers balanced test scores with other assignments to help students who don't test well pull through.",
            "After your first semester, don't go to registrar to sign up for classes. Most students i knew and virtually every problem I had at dutchess stemmed from student services. You can register for classes online. There are program outlines available in the main office. Follow those outlines closely.",
            "Dutchess is a smart decision for students with economic troubles or who are putting themselves through. It is designed to help students maintain a good gpa. Most teachers were personable and wanted to help."

After the summer of 2012 they will be up and students will have access to the on campus housing., 218479=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 176974=Tuition alone is approximately $2000 or even less for a semesters worth of credits. Classes are per credit, and with the quality of the education you'll receive at this school, it's definitely worth it. Especially if you don't know exactly what you want to do in life., 53556=This is a community college so I can not give any comments on dorm life. They are however in the process of building dorms that will open in Fall 2012., 138968=It is considerably cheaper then most schools. Why waste thousands of dollars to take the same classes you could take for $1500 at Dutchess?}",

    "textAfterTable": "Did enjoy being here I enjoyed the help from a few select teachers in the school. However, the faculty in charge of admissions and the registrars office are not helpful. I was bounced between at least 3-4 different offices regularly when I had a question or was registering for a new class. If you need help, ask fellow students. (especially the student help desk) Did learn a lot In the short time I attended Dutchess I did have a fairly good learning experience. But when it came to receiving help at their south campus it was a nightmare.
