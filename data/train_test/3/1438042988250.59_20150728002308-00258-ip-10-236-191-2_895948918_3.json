Titled \"In Plainsong,\" the eight-show stint will kick off on June 15 in Buffalo, NY, at the Riviera Theatre, and wraps up on June 25 in Minneapolis, MN,\u2026, 6874=That's the story he tells of his repeated attempts to resurrect Smashing Pumpkins after seven years away (from 2000 to 2007). When he reconvened the band as the sole original member left in the group, he attempted to challenge an audience much different than the fans they had played to a decade before. Corgan says that gone were the crowds who would brave a rain-lashed concert for a seven-minute instrumental. Instead, Corgan says many of them demanded Top 10 songs instead of \"high -minded art concepts.\", 5188=There's something about a frontman that can hit a high note without trying. Yes, you have your Scott Weilands, Chris Cornells, and Anthony Kiedises. But nothing can compare to the sweet sounds of one Billy Corgan, plus guitarist James Iha, bass guitarist D'Arcy Wretzky, and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. They made up the phenomenal alt rock band called Smashing Pumpkins. Hailing originally from Chicago, the band began in 1988 and was able to sign with the local label Limited Potential for their debut album., 4581=It was the year of 1990 when Limited Potential gave the green light for the release of one single, sort of to test the music industry waters -- the single was 'I Am One.' It sold out quicker than IHOP pankcakes and then prompted another single release, 'Tristessa.' The music was so infectious that Virgin Records ultimately grabbed hold of the band and signed them to a major deal. Their official first album release, Gish, saw the light of a Spring day in 1991. It did well enough to prompt the release of a second album, which Corgan himself worked hard on. The resulting work was called Siamese Dream, a huge and immaculate production of remarkable sounds. Some of the top hits in that album were 'Cherub Rock,' 'Today,' and 'Disarm.' Most people, though, would claim that the Pumpkins' best album was the third: Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. Helmed by the tremendous singles 'Bullet with Butterfly Wings,' '1979,' 'Zero,' and of course 'Tonight, Tonight,' this album went platinum over eight times! It was the highlight of the Pumpkins' career., 5494=On March 25, 2014 Corgan announced a new record deal with BMG. Tommy Lee, of Motley Crue, then jumped in to play drums on \"Monuments to an Elegy,\" which will be released on December 9.}",
