            "Although they get a bad rap, joining a fraternity or sorority is great way to meet people as well as make a brother or sister for life. The greatest decision I could have made was joining Sigma Phi Epsilon: This fraternity will be different.",
            "From intramurals to frisbee on the mall to hockey games, there's plenty to do at the University of Maine!",
            "The dining halls have a wide variety of choices, from buffalo chicken to honey wasabi salmon, accommodating to any palette.",
            "It's awesome. When you live on your own for the first time, you realize how much you took for granted, but how much you enjoy the experience regardless.",
            "Both challenging and comfortable. I've never been intimidated by my schoolwork.",
            "As much as you'll want to skimp on things, don't. Go the extra mile and work hard on your studies. You won't regret come midterms and finals when you discover that 4.0 GPA!",
            "My professors are very encouraging and helpful. The dorm life experience is one I would do over and over if I had the chance. It may be cold in the winter, but the fall, spring, and summer months make the experience worth it."

Rumble on the Hill (various competitions between dorms). Healthy High 5k (Run/walk on April 20th at 4:20 PM)., 9009=There is over 900 student in greek life on campus, 8 men\u2019s fraternities or 7 women\u2019s sororities. Greek life has been at UMaine since 1874 and is a big part of the school and to those who want to be involved in it. For many students it enhances there time here at UMaine and it is a great community. They support academic support/excellence, and show leadership in the community. Greek life can either be apart of your experience here at UMaine, or it does't have to be at all, it is up to the student. But greek life for many students here is a great experience., 419040=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 352333=There is a police station on campus with safety boxes everywhere. I have never felt unsafe. I have a job on campus and get out around 12:00AM. There are always student walking around and the campus police make themselves noticed - not in a negative way., 139551=I will be starting classes in the fall of 2012 but I believe the University of Maine has a wonderful reputation for their degrees they offer. I'm extremely excited to begin my college education here and experience their beautiful campus. Not only do I believe their campus and degrees are very high quality, I have heard they are always there for you. I know I am not going to be alone through my college process, all the professors and staff are they 100% to make sure everyone is getting through college as smoothly as possible., 373407=It's nice from September to mid October, then starts to get nice again in May, right before the end of the year. All the time, everyday in between, it's a dark, gray, very very cold world. A big party school, probably because drinking alcohol makes you not feel the frigid winter chill.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Those that love community, UMaine really is it's own community within the town of Orono. If you go to UMaine you can't be afraid of snow or cold weather. It does get really cold in the winter sometimes walking to class! Tips for prospective students Take advantage of all the school has to offer. Don't sit in your dorm all day doing nothing or you will be miserable. Go to class, teachers typically always ask questions on the exam about what they said in class. Take good notes, but don't write everything down. If you're having trouble in a class don't be afraid to ask for help. UMaine has many free tutoring programs on campus that you should take advantage of. Bang for the buck Paying a lot for a school is really just paying for a brand name version of any product. UMaine is a public university and is on the low end as far as price is concerned, but it is a perfectly suitable for any student especially those who are not entirely sure what they want to do. Don't choose a college based on it's name or price. In the long run what matters more is the fact that you got a college education and enjoyed the environment you were in while",
