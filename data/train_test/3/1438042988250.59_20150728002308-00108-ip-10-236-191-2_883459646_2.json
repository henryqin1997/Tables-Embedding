    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{9565=8/29/13: The Anaheim Ducks path to repeating as Pacific Division champions just got a bit harder. Veteran defenseman Sheldon Souray injured his wrist and had surgery last month. He will be out for 4-6 months. Souray is key player on the powerplay, setting up the offense and offering a big shot from the point. Last season was his first in Anaheim, and he was solid with seven goals and 10 assists. He will be hard to replace in the short term, so the team will have to try to tread water until he returns, which would be December at the earliest., 16421=11/14/13: The San Jose Sharks started out as one of the hottest teams in the league and earned a lot of recognition for that. Move over San Jose, Anaheim is now the best team in California. The Ducks have won five straight games and are getting help from all over their roster. Recently they beat the Vancouver Canucks and that was without star Ryan Getzlaf. They now lead the NHL with 31 points, which is three more than Colorado. After missing the playoffs in the 2011-12 season, the Ducks have shown a lot of resiliency by making the playoffs last season and are on their way this time around., 27218=3/13/14: The Anaheim Ducks were active as like other teams were at the trade deadline - of course, when you have the best team in the league in terms of points and are a very legitimate Stanley Cup contender, you should not have many holes to fill. The Ducks sent goalie Viktor Fasth to Edmonton in exchange for a fifth round pick in the June draft (yet another goalie move by the Oilers). The bigger news was that they shipped out Dustin Penner to the Washington Capitals for a fourth round pick in June. Last, they acquired Stephane Robidas from Dallas for a fourth rounder. The theme here is that they have few holes and can trade assets for the future without disrupting the current roster., 11387=9/19/13: This can be filed under \"U\" for unnecessary or unwarranted or un-understandable. The Ducks announced that they would throw a 'Throwback' night on October 13 against the Ottawa Senator. Throwback, in this case, does not mean throwing back Bobby Ryan jerseys. It is actually to celebrate the team's 20th anniversary. Anaheim will bring back retro jerseys (yes, the purple ones. Ugh) and reminisce about the time they were known as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim (and were among the worst teams in the league). Future hall of fame forward Teemu Selanne should not be subject to this in his farewell tour., 12656=10/3/13: Anaheim took a big step last season by finishing second in Western Conference in the regular season. Their playoff run was short-lived, however, as Detroit eliminated them in the first round. The team expects to build on that experience in the 2013-14 season. Forward Bobby Ryan is now gone, so he cannot be a distraction anymore, but the Ducks do return two thirds of their top line with Ryan Getzlaf and Corey Perry. It looks like he will be joined by Dustin Penner or Kyle Palmieri. One thing to look forward to: the Ducks will play the L.A. Kings at Dodger Stadium in January., 43816=10/8/14: The Anaheim Ducks may be one of the elite teams in the Western Conference again this season, but they are dealing with some internal strife. Former star Teemu Selanne released a tell-all book last month (in Finland) and had some criticism for Ducks head coach Bruce Boudreau, as well as captain Ryan Getzlaf. Getzlaf is not happy about the comments that he did not lobby for Selanne to get more ice time - Getzlaf claimed he did. In any case, Selanne is retired, unless he is going to play in Europe, so there will not be the daily awkwardness about the situation. At least until the night they retire Selanne's number in January., 22712=1/23/14: The Ducks are the best team in the NHL right now and took care of business in St. Louis on Saturday. But they may play in the most unique game of the NHL season this Saturday. The Ducks are set to square off against in-town rival Los Angeles Kings on January 25th. Nothing unusual about that, except they are playing outdoors, in Southern California, at Dodger Stadium. Playing outdoor games has been en vogue for a number of years, but always in cold weather cities. Playing in sunny California is quite another matter. The game will be at night, and will be a very interesting game to see., 41994=9/17/14: There is no denying that the Western Conference of the NHL is the superior conference, and, quite frankly, there are probably six to eight teams that have the talent to not just make the playoffs, but win the Stanley Cup. Certainly, the Anaheim Ducks are one of those elite teams. GM Bruce Boudreau has done a nice job of assembling players to win in the West. Now he has been rewarded for his efforts. He got his contract extension, guaranteeing that he will be in charge through 2016-17 - or at least get a nice buyout if the Ducks decide to fire him., 1951=What's also clear is the potential of the Anaheim Ducks to pose the biggest challenge to the Chicago Blackhawks in the 2013 Stanley Cup Playoff's Western Conference bracket. While the Blackhawks had a remarkable run to start the season, the Ducks had a run of their own in the second half of the season to keep the No. 1 seed in question than many expected. Two late-seaons four-game losing streaks, however, allowed the Blackhawks to pull away and actually gave the division-rival Los Angeles Kings a narrow shot at the Pacific Division title. The Ducks held off that push, though, and will now take aim at a team such as the Minnesota Wild in the first round. Assuming the seeding holds, Anaheim would then look toward a matchup with the Northwest Division champion Vancouver Canucks, a team with whom they split two early season meetings and will meet once more in the regular season., 13997=10/17/13: The Ducks are off to a nice start to the season winning three of their first four games. So far, it does not look like the miss former forward Bobby Ryan. Ryan, as many recall, is a very talented offensive threat. He played for the Ducks for several years but is probably best known for trying to get out of Anaheim. He made mention during the 2012 All-Star Game that Philadelphia would be a nice fit for him. He did not get traded then or even last season. He was finally moved to Ottawa, but again, it does not look like the Ducks miss him. He makes his first trip back to Anaheim this week. It will be interesting to see if he is welcomed back or booed when he steps on the ice., 25801=2/27/14: Congratulations to Teemu Selanne and the Finnish Olympic hockey team for bringing home the bronze medal. While everyone would like to go out with a gold, Telanne ends his Olympic career with a stylish finish. Selanne netted two goals in his last game, a 5-0 win over Team USA for the bronze medal. He has been playing for Team Finland for 26 years, longer than many Olympians have even been alive. He has played a big part in Finland winning four medals since 1998, more than any other country, with 24 goals and 43 points in 37 Olympic games. Congratulations Teemu, you deserved a storybook ending., 40776=8/21/14: The oddly placed 'F' is 'Finally'. The Anaheim Ducks finally announced that they have come to an agreement with forward Jakob Silfverberg. The deal is for one season at $850,000, and provides a bit of depth. Silfverberg was a restricted free agent, so this was just a matter of time. He scored 10 goals for the Ducks last season and added another 13 assists in 53 games. He was also a key contributor to Team Sweden in the Olympics last February, helping them win the silver (silfver?) medal. He is a good role player and the kind that every team needs to advance in the NHL playoffs., 20792=1/2/14: There is a lot of good hockey being played in Southern California these days - probably the best in the entire NHL. The Kings have lost only three times in December while the Ducks have a ten game unbeaten streak of the their own. Anaheim is putting distance between themselves and everyone else. Their lead on second place San Jose is now at seven points and the Ducks are tied with the Blackhawks for most points overall with 61. Anaheim also has a game in hand against Chicago, and that could be a factor later on in the season as both teams try to win the President's Trophy for most points in the regular season., 467=The most likely matchup for the Ducks are the Minnesota Wild, who Anaheim is undefeated against this season. The other less-likely teams to be paired in the first round of the 2013 NHL PLayoffs all had winning records against the Anaheim Ducks. Anaheim is guaranteed home ice advantage at the Honda Center for the first two round of the 2013 Stanley Cup Playoffs., 5869=7/18/13: Vancouver GM Mike Gillis is planning a face-to-face meeting with goaltender Roberto Luongo in Florida in the near future. Most people expected Luongo to be traded this offseason, but it was starter Cory Schnieder who was traded (to New Jersey) instead. Luongo has among the most crippling contracts in all of pro sports. He is signed through the 2021-2022 season, and no other team seems willing (and rightfully so) to take on his contract. Not that it is likely, but maybe Vancouver is hoping that he will retire from the NHL and go to Russia like Ilya Kovalchek did last week., 5264=7/11/13: Anaheim finally traded team pest Bobby Ryan. Ryan, who is a very talented player, has been unhappy in Anaheim for years. Last year, at the draft, he publicly speculated that Philadelphia would be a good place for him. Well, he is not going to Philly. He is going to the Capital of Canada - Ottawa, Ontario. The Senators had an immediate need to replace their departed captain Daniel Alfredson after he went to the Red Wings in free agency (after 17 years with the team). In return, the Ducks get Jakob Silfverberg, Stefan Noesen and the Senators' first round pick in 2014., 19530=12/19/13: This could be bad news for the rest of the league, especially to the other teams in the Pacific Division. The Anaheim Ducks are returning to health. The Ducks are already on top of the Pacific Division and second overall in the ultra-competitive Western Conference (Chicago is first overall). Forward Jakob Silfverberg has been out since October but should be back by Christmas. Defensemen Francois Beauchemin and Mark Fristik as well as center Mathieu Perreault are slated to return soon as well. With four key players coming back to the roster, the Ducks look like they are going to get stronger as the year moves on., 35941=6/19/14: Anaheim has made the first move in the new offseason by trading for Louis Leblanc from the Montreal Canadiens. Leblanc was a first round pick of the Habs in 2009 and is a hometown guy. He did not do much in Montreal's organization, only registering five goals and five assists in the 2011-12 season. Most of the time, he was struggling in the minors with the Hamilton Bulldogs. Perhaps a change of scenery and not having the pressure of being a hometowner will help him out. He has loads of potential and perhaps the Ducks can capitalize on that with this low risk trade., 41414=8/28/14: Some potentially good news for fans of the Anaheim Ducks and professional hockey in general in the Western half of North America. The top minor league, the American Hockey League (AHL) could begin migrating west as soon as the 2015-16 season. Currently, several Western Conference teams have their minor league affiliates on the East Coast, causing logistical problems with promotions and demotions. Reportedly, Anaheim would purchase an AHL team (following a recent trend around the league) and move it to San Diego, California. And how great would it be to have quality hockey in a lovely city like San Diego?, 40165=8/7/14: The Ducks have not been in existence for very long, especially compared to teams like the Montreal Candiens or Toronto Maple Leafs. That being said, the Ducks have a Stanley Cup under their belt (looking at you, St. Louis) and have had a number of star players pass through their system. But none is greater than Teemu Selanne. The team plans to retire his number 8 jersey on January 11, 2015 in a game against the Winnipeg Jets. The original Jets drafted him. Of course, a Finnish team is trying to get him to play one more season, so he may not be available., 7715=8/8/13: The Anaheim Ducks returned to the playoffs this past season after a few years hiatus. The team finished the shortened regular season with the second best record in the Western Conference, but was knocked out of the playoffs in the first round by the Detroit Red Wings - even after holding a 3-2 series lead going into Game 6. The biggest offseason news is trading away Bobby Ryan to Ottawa and signing Dustin Penner from the crosstown L.A. Kings. Most of the rest of the team will return for the 2013-14 season, though there has been no word yet if the ageless Teemu Selane will come back for another season., 12049=9/26/13: The Anaheim Ducks are picking up where they left off in the 2013 regular season, winning games. The Ducks earned their third preseason victory by beating the San Jose Sharks 3-2 on Friday. Ben Lovejoy (no relation to Reverend Timothy Lovejoy) scored 2:48 into overtime by firing a shot between Sharks' goalie Antti Niemi's legs. The win was costly though. Emerson Etem, who scored in the second period, collided with Raffi Torres and suffered a lower body injury. He returned briefly, but then left the game for good. It is still a good start for the Ducks, who are trying to claim Southern California as their own over the L.A. Kings., 4665=6/13/13: Congratulations are in order for Dwayne Roloson, who was announced as the Ducks new goaltending coach after legend Pete Peeters retired. Roloson lasted a long time in the NHL. He had a late revival in 2010-11 with the Tampa Bay Lightning, leading them to the Eastern Conference Finals. He could not match that performance the following season and eventually retired. Roloson comes into a good gig. He had been scouting goalies for the team, so he knows the personnel, and he will be working with two very good pros in Jonas Hiller and Viktor Fasth from the start.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{11855=NHL Playoffs - Pacific Division Two of the last seven Stanley Cup titles have landed on the West Coast, with a third narrowly escaping the Pacific Division's grasp when the Bruins beat the Canucks in the thrilling seven-game series of 2011. While only three seeds from the revamped Pacific managed to qualify for the NHL\u2026, 6744=11/15/12: Anaheim's AHL affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals (who were the Tampa Bay Lightning's AHL affiliate until earlier this year) are 7-5 thus far in the 2012-13 season - good enough for second place in the AHL East Division. They trail the Syracuse Crunch by two points, who are, incidentally, Tampa's new AHL affiliate. Last season's Admirals crushed the rest of the league and set a record for most consecutive victories. Most of those players are now in Syracuse, but still within the Lightning family. So the debate is raging - who is the defending Calder Cup champion, the Admirals team, or the Crunch whose players actually won the trophy?, 7988=11/1/12: How the Anaheim Ducks will look in year or two is anyone's guess. Cornerstone offensive players Corey Perry and Ryan Getzlaf both have contracts that expire at the end of the season, and Teemu Selanne may opt to retire. The Ducks had a chance to begin reshaping their roster last season by dumping salary for prospects, but instead decided to continue on with their veterans. They finished 34-36-12, last in Pacific Division and out of the playoffs. Now they have to figure out a way to retain Perry and Getzlaf, replace Selanne, and that may all start by dealing unhappy camper Bobby Ryan., 10559=8/2/12: The Ducks will not get burned again by a top draft pick who uses a loophole to get out of a contract. Anaheim was in the news frequently when their 2008 second-round pick Justin Schultz famously decided to never sign a contract. He became a free agent in June, though he had never played a second in the NHL. NHL teams understand the risk when they spend a high draft pick on a European or Russian player - that the player may never come to North America. But not a native son. The Ducks locked up their first round pick (#6 overall) Hampus Lindholm quickly and will bring him in for camp this time around.}",
