Also, by providing on the laser trimming unit a characteristic value measuring means, a laser oscillation means, and a laser scanning means, it is possible to laser trim electronic components while their characteristic values are being measured; and by controlling the path of laser irradiation based on the image recognized by an image pick up means, it is possible to perform trimming without the fear of mistrimming and with high reliability. Also, as the electronic components mounting apparatus in accordance with the present invention is provided with a laser trimming unit to trim electronic components to preferable characteristic values, the above method of mounting can be realized in such a way that the electronic components can be trimmed to preferable characteristic values by laser trimming within the mounting process. Also, by laser trimming electronic components while their characteristic values are being measured or while their trimming positions are being observed through image recognition, it is possible to perform trimming without degrading the quality of the electronic components",
