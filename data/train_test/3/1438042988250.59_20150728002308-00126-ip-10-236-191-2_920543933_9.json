            "Although not many dorms, they are easily found and easy to go through.",
            "Many students say that the classes are easy but it is major dependent. Professors expect a large amount of work to be done by each student and expect the best quality as well.",

I will be taking my tour in May., 55980=I have no idea how the campus was in the previous years, but as I right this review it is 2011. When coming to SUNY Delhi you need to have your wits in tack. There are many great, friendly students at this college,but be on the look out for those students who only want to have a good time. They will surely led you astray. Even though it may seem dull, the campus has a lot of fun activities weekly and it keeps the college life fresh and fun. Dorms are good, while others are just decent. Applying early gives your first picks on the good dorms.}",

Bang for the buck Tuition keeps going up so its hard to say we are getting a 'Bang for the buck'. Its a great school and it is cheaper than most because it is a SUNY school. Am enjoying being here I love the rural atmosphere. I grew up in the country so I love going to college in the country. Am learning a lot The professors are knowledgeable. I am in the IT Management major and I have learned a lot, even though I came in knowing a lot about the IT world to begin with.
