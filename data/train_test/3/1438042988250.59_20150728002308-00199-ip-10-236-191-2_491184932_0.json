Beyond the cows that are among the exhibits in the barn, the state\u2019s dairy farmers take their involvement at the fair pretty seriously. Through Midwest Dairy, they are sponsors, concessionaires, educators and media subjects throughout the fair\u2019s five-day run beginning Aug. 30. The popular dairy concession owned by South Dakota\u2019s dairy farmers will serve more than 5,000 milk shakes, 200 gallons of ice cream and 800 gallons of all-you-can-drink milk during the fair. Nearby, an educational display shows videos taken on some of the state\u2019s premier dairy farms. Children\u2019s activities are also available, including a nearly life-size model cow named Bessie that can be \u2018milked\u2019 for a glimpse of how hand-milking a real cow might feel., 6583=08.22.2012}",
