    "textAfterTable": "Figure 13. Photos. Installation of the SDCWS. Technology Description TAPCO's SDCWS utilizes Day-Viz\u2122 LED enhanced solar powered signs and BlinkerBeam\u2122 wireless controllers along with ultra-low power radar to detect and flash a series of chevron signs along with the advance warning sign in a horizontal curve. This system both warns and guides drivers through any upcoming horizontal curves. The SDCWS is meant to replace existing W1-8 and advance warning signage or be used in the design of a new curve as a low-cost warning system. Chapter 2C of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) and engineering judgment should be applied when determining appropriate sign layouts and locations. Using the length and speed of the curve, the user can set each of the W1-8 chevron signs to flash in a specific sequence or time interval. Each curve design will have different sign placement and geometry for consideration when determining the appropriate flash sequence. Typically, each sign will flash at least once per second according to MUTCD guidelines, with a minimum flash \"ON\" time of 100 milliseconds. When the quantity of chevrons exceeds nine, chevrons are commonly divided into two separate sequentially flashing systems in which the first and fifth sign will",
