            "Waterfront is known as lover's lane if you walk the entire waterfront with a partner of the opposite sex rumor is you will get married to that person. Ogden circle is sacred to Hamptonians, if you cross it before graduation rumor is you will not graduate on time. Historical trademarks are the emancipation oak tree, wigwam and virginia cleveland hall.",
            "Since I am not from VA I have to pay double their tuition and for $32,000 I feel it is overpriced. There are no cars allowed on campus for freshman and sophmores so you have to pay for transportation off campus. There isn't much to do on campus either.",
            "The new cafeteria is big and has a beautiful view of our waterfront. Offers a wide variety of food.",
            "Dorms definitely need improvement.",
            "Hampton University is a university full of school spirit, where students from a wide variety attend. I am a city girl so it is quite dull around here but the friends I have made here make it fun. Eduction wise I love all my professors, choose the right one and you'll be fine!"

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{1882=I enjoy the campus life. We call it our home by the sea. The xampus is very pretty. It is also filled with excitement and activities. For example, our student center containts a bowling alley, movie theatre, pool room, fitness room and a dance room. Every Friday there ie a 12:00 to 2:00. There is a dj and other activities during that time. There are sometimes concerts and comedy shows to attend. Trey Songs performed at Ogden Hall last year. Marlyn Wayans also came to campus to talk to us about the Obama election., 244600=Hampton does not currently have all of the divine nine fraternities and sororities on campus. As of Spring 2012, Alpha Phi Alpha, Delta Sigma Theta, and Phi Beta Sigma are not present on campus. There are also band, music, and social fraternities on campus. Every Greek letter organization is given a week to promote their fraternity or sorority., 265756=The food and cafeteria was not bad just difficult to get used to. The cafe opened and closed at designated times. It forced you to change your eating habits but change is good. Hampton University is opening a new cafeteria in September, I am excited to eat there., 109406=I love my HIU! Nobody has school spirit like Hampton. Due to the school being so small students band together and support each other with free promo, flyers, and social networks, should've seen us cheer for our fellow Hamptonian Olympian this 2012 summer!!, 450132=Hampton University has Chick Fila, Subway, and a coffee shoppe. HU also has small dining areas on campus. Our newest dining facility opened in 2012 and offers a spectacular view of the bay. The cafeteria food is on the come up, but beware of the freshman 15, I have seen it happen!!, 59745=the cafeteria at hampton u is very popular, but not because the food is good. many students complain about how bad the food is, spoiled food, not enough options, and poor quality. although the cafeteria is known to have horrible food, the administration is well aware and started a building fund to build an new cafeteria. they have started building and the estimated year of completion will be the year of 2014. hopefully, from the looks of the building as of right now, it seems that the building may be done by 2013. we are all waiting!, 427139=When I began HU Online tuition was fair. To date it has increased by less than $1000 overall., 141555=The food is pretty good. Our new cafeteria just opened up in august of 2012 which was definitely a step up. We also have small fast food places around campus where you can eat from too. So we have a small variety., 267433=Hampton University will be your home by the sea. Prospective Students make sure you apply before November 1st to be eligible for scholarships. During high school, keep your grades high and always try to enhance your learning experience in every situation. Hampton University has taught me to have the competitive edge and to be the best I can be., 584399=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 514010=The campus is near many Navy bases. A tradition at Hampton is our class names. Each class (freshman, sophomores, juniors and seniors) each have class name and it gets passed down form the senior class to the new incoming freshman. For example 2013-2014's senior class is titled Onyx 9 and the fresh.man class is Onyx 10, 518388=Campus police are always walking or driving around campus. There are also call boxes all over campus just in case you are in trouble or you just want a police officer to walk you back to your dorm. Also, no one gets on campus without showing ID and going through a sercurity gate. This a really safe campus, I feel fine walking somewhere at night. Also all of the dorm doors lock after 11:00 pm and require students to swipe their student ID to get in, however if the student does not live in the dorm, the door will not unlock with their student ID., 155837=1. Do your research- There are merit base scholarships for incoming freshmen ranging from partial to full rides based on SAT/ACT scores and your GPA. Applicants must apply to Hampton before Nov 1 to be considered for these scholarships. 2. Visit- Hampton is a beautiful campus. If you are considering attending, schedule a campus tour., 272386=there is a small gap in the greek life but the whole yard is supposed to be back on campus in Fall 2012, 199389=the student center is the place to be on wednesdays and fridays from noon to 2:00 pm. the students on campus know it as 12 to 2, there is always a dj spinning, fraternities and sororities strolling, and people just having a good time dancing to the music. if you want to lay back and relax with your significant other, spend time at the waterfront which is a beautiful view of the sea., 547941=Hampton has partnered with a great dining team, the Gourmet Services company that serves a variety of items and even spices things up by having themes depending on the holiday or event. We also have a cafeteria that opened its doors in 2012 and it has a grand waterfront view, with a view of downtown Hampton as well., 267963=Hampton University a diverse Historically Black University with endless opportunities. It became my home by the sea the minute I stepped foot on my beautiful campus. I am very please and honored to get my degree from this prestigious university in May 2013., 325451=There's a new cafe, so I'm not sure if anything has changed... but when I was there (2005-2009), the best things were the waffles and the sandwich bar., 549627=Hampton University is a rich part of Virginian history and culture. Hampton is historically Black and Native American. Founded in 1868, Hampton is the perfect mix of tradition, discipline, and endless opportunity.}",

    "textAfterTable": "08/31/2009 Reviewer is A past student here. 27 out of 27 people found this review useful. 2 of 124 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Hampton is for someone who wants to get that traditional HBCU experience. A person who is about their business and sees themselves going somewhere in the future. Set the bar high and only good things will come. You can do anything you put your mind to. Tips for prospective students Make sure that you schedule a campus tour and visit the dorms. Take time to do research on the school and it's history as well as the program for your desired major. Enter Hampton with an open mind and heart and be as active as possible. Bang for the buck Although Hampton is an exensive school it is well worth it. The campus is to die for. Hampton is on the list of best HBCU's in the country....and that is no joke. The education you will receive is excellent. I believe that there shouldn't be a price on education because that's what is going to prepare and mold you",
