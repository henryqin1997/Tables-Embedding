    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{21128=The document WO 92/11893 describes an intra-aortic balloon apparatus comprising a hollow catheter in which is located an elongated member forming a central lumen extending out of the catheter at the distal end thereof. An aortic pumping balloon is positioned over the elongated member; the distal end of the balloon is bonded to a tip affixed to the distal end of the elongated member, and its proximal end is bonded to the distal end of the catheter. In order to achieve a balance of flexibility and remains and to avoid kinking, the elongated member is formed of an inner layer comprised of a soft elastomeric material to impart flexibility to the tubing, and the outer layer is comprised of a hard plastic material to impart structural support to the elongated member. The combination of these two layers is made to achieve a very durable and flexible structure exhibiting a low kink radius. This balloon apparatus cannot be loaded with a guidewire and moved into tortuous vessels with the guidewire loaded inside the elongated tube. The friction between guidewire and the elongated member increases distinctively when the elongated member is shaped into curves. The above procedure would therefore risk that the spiral wound guidewire could be captured in the soft elastomeric plastic material of the inner layer of the elongated member. Although the outer layer of the elongated member that is coextruded onto the inner layer is formed from nylon, a material which is directly weldable to a wide variety of materials, this balloon apparatus cannot be introduced into narrow vessels or narrow stenoses nor can it be passed through narrow punctures to enter the blood vessels. This is because of the relatively large profile of the folded balloon. The large profile is due to the distal fixture of the balloon to the elongated member. The balloon is bonded to an intermediate tip element which in turn is bonded to the elongated member., 19474=This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/657,004, filed on May 28, 1996 now abandoned, which is a continuation of Ser. No. 08/309,234, filed on Sep. 20, 1994 (abandoned).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As a variant, the two tubes configuration of the tube 7 may be replaced by a single tube or by a configuration having more than two longitudinally affixed tubes. The tube 7 is exemplified here as being made of two tubes 9 and 10 longitudinally affixed to one another. Preferably the tubes 9 and 10 shall be made of a polyamid to achieve easy fixing by welding procedures and to obtain a stepped stiffness. The proximal end of tube 10 is connected to conventional fittings (not shown) to feed the balloon and drive the catheter assembly. Inside the catheter tube 1 is placed a guide wire 11 in sliding fit within the inner layer 2 forming the longitudinal lumen 12. A tube 7 is arranged over the catheter tube 1, at a radial distance thereof, thus defining an inflating lumen 8 for the balloon 4. The proximal end 6 of the balloon 4 is welded onto the distal end of said tube 7. Over the distal portion of the catheter tube 1 is positioned a balloon 4 the distal end 5 of which is sealed to the outer layer 3 of the catheter tube 1, for instance by welding. The interventional catheter shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 comprises a catheter tube 1 which is formed, in this embodiment, of two superposed continuous layers 2 and 3 extending all over the length of the tube 1;",
