            "there are many clubs to choose from. anyone could join anything! a perfect place to build up your resume'.",
            "f.i.u is great for any type of student. this school is very diverse.",
            "if you are a science or business major, the library will become your new home. it is the best place to study, and because most of the people there are doing the same thing, study groups could be formed.",
            "if you are a florida resident, coming here would not be a issue at all. being an out-of-state student, paying for school is more expensive, however, f.i.u is not an expensive school at all compared to other states. it's worth every penny",
            "it's miami! there is always something going on in or off campus. ask anyone, everyone is willing to be helpful.",
            "fresh is the place to go. there so many places to choose from on campus, you'll never be bored",
            "amazing. anyone would enjoy living on dorm. it makes going to early classes easier.",
            "classes here are tough, but thats college. nothing is easy, it is what the student makes out of each class.",
            "still confused? choose regular classes and explore your surroundings. in f.i.u, they make it alright not to know what you want to be in life and direct you to a path that suits you.",
            "an amazing school to attend. coming from new york, florida international university felt like home with the warm people and the warm climate. i would recommend anyone to come here."

Top 30% of high school class at Hialeah-Miami Lakes Sr. High. Earned Dean's List honor during Spring 2011 at Miami-Dade College., 146057=Florida International University(FIU) has been a welcoming and encouraging environment ever since i started my studies in the summer of 2012. Being a recent high school graduate, I was afraid attending this college so fast, especially during summer would be too much to handle. I was wrong, the professors and student alumni really reach out and help the freshman, in order to fit in to a more comfortable and friendly zone., 99034=There are lots of places to go eat around campus but mainly in the Graham center. They are constantly adding more and more places to eat, currently they are building a Panda Express and a Taco Bell on campus. adding these franchises to the present collection of Burger King, Pollo Tropical, Cafe Bustelo, Alamazar, Chili's, Chic-fil-a, Moe's, Dunkin Donuts, And several other franchise restaurants. there is also a cafeteria place called Fresh Foods Company, this place is a buffet and at the beginning of the semester the food here is always good, and it has many options for food, salads, sandwiches, pizza, and a variety of other hot foods. There are currently 2 Starbucks on campus and a new one is being built within a new building scheduled to be completed later in 2014. There is a salad place called Salad Creations also, and they make really delicious salads but they're kinda pricey so normally I just stick to Chic-Fil-A., 823125=FIU is the 18th largest university in the United States. FIU also has the distinction of being the largest minority-majority university in America and will have an enrollment of more than 60,000 for the 2012-2013 school year. FIU is an awesome facility and an exciting place to learn., 315685=be ready to walk or maybe even run to your classes. some may be right next to each other, but others might be on the other end of the campus. i suggest 10/11 o'clock classes. that extra hour of sleep is like heaven., 814044=FIU offers many places to eat on campus between the two campuses. On the north campus, there are many places to dine at like Moe's Southwest Grill, Bistro Subs, Grille Works, etc. On the main campus, there are twenty plus places to dine at like Chick-fil-a, Burger King, Pollo Tropical, Moe's Southwest Grill, Chili's, etc. Also, there are places on campus where you can go to get a snack at 3 o'clock in the morning and they offer cookies that are super yummy and fresh out the oven at all times of the day., 222832=I found a lot of information about this school. I am planning on attending in 2013 to study Premed. I researched their different programs and this will be a perfect school to study Premed to become a Forensic Pathologist., 129092=Florida International University was not my first choice when I was applying for schools back in 2011, but FIU has changed my life. It is a commuter school, but through my involvements I have grown as a person and as a leader. I believe that FIU is an amazing school and it is highly underrated.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here The campus is simply great, especially the first week. There is so many activities and events happening all over the campus. There are many clubs and extracurricular activities to be involved in. For example, I am currently working with a group of other students to develop an on-campus series to air in FIU. The experience that is gained is simply amazing. There are a lot of opportunities that can open doors for you. Am learning a lot Florida International University is simply great. A lot of teachers care that you pass, just be sure you study a lot, do homework, and put in effort. In the end, you will truly be rewarded.
