    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{140468=In accordance with FIG. 27, the BSCU 14 checks the vehicle location to confirm that the vehicle location 141 a corresponds to the programmed vehicle location 140 a. When actual vehicle location 141 a is different from the planned route location 140 a changes are made 142 a in the planned route data. Determining when the vehicle 19 is at a predetermined location on a map is shown in FIG. 28. The actual location points and/or addresses 341 a-341 f are determined by the VLDB 14 a, the MSDB 14 b, and the URDB 14 d, then stored into the NDB 14 c. In FIG. 27 a user at 1010 Oak Lane 332 has requested an advance warning time. The advance warning time is five minutes and thirty seconds 336 before XYZ Delivery Company 335 delivery truck arrives. When the vehicle crosses any locations matching notification time/s 341, shown in more detail in FIG. 28, the advance warning is activated. The only exception is a stop that is scheduled between an activation point/location and the final destination. The delay of notification for each stop between (FIG. 27) 343 is used to determine an arrival time when other stops will be made between the activation points and the targeted destination. Past route averages normally determine how much time a stop will take. In FIG. 27, block diagram 343, each stop in-between the activation points/locations and the final destination will take fifty-five seconds. Each stop the vehicle makes, at each location, can be averaged and therefore different and better determinations of actual delivery times can be made for more accurate advance warning message times. Although time is used as the advance notification method 336 in this example, notification by distance 337, and notification by location 338 can also be used., 137345=For example, FIG. 14 shows a finished delivery route that started at seven thirty. After starting the delivery route, the delivery vehicle arrives at stop number 001 at 07:37:22 AM 610 after driving seven minutes and twenty-two seconds 609. Stop 001 takes two minutes to unload all the packages and another two minutes and ten seconds to reach stop 002 at 07:41:32 AM. Stop 003 takes five minutes and forty-five seconds from the time the vehicle arrived at stop 002. The arrival at stop 004 is on time but the delivery takes an unexpected ten minutes 614 and causes a ten-minute delay 615 in the scheduled route. The scheduled route list was rescheduled by the delay 615 of ten minutes and stop 005 was reached ten minutes later than the scheduled planned route, at 08:13:34 AM. The VCU display in FIG. 14 and block diagram 602 is an example of the information that the driver sees and uses. The other route information shown in FIG. 14 and block diagram 601, is not needed for driver interaction and is a VCU 12 automatic component for lowering the wireless communication between BSCU 14 and the VCU 12. Although not disclosed in this example, additional directions with or without map displays, estimated route completion times, on or off normal schedule indicators, and others may also be displayed on the VCU display module 33. Just prior to leaving a stop, the driver views his next stop on the display module 33. Additional directions can be activated by the drivers' input or automatically after a predefined time period or a predefined distance the vehicle has traveled. The automatic display changes may start when the driver arrives at a stop by displaying the next location. The display shows the next address until the vehicle has started moving and the display cycles between the next stop's address and a map display showing directions. The display continues to cycle until the vehicle arrives at the next stop, then the sequence repeats., 156447=The BSCU 14 communication controller 16 may also control a second messaging means over a normal telephone network as described in more detail in the Patent Application \u201cADVANCE NOTIFICATION SYSTEM AND METHOD\u201d filed May 18, 1993 by Jones et al. and assigned Ser. No. 08/063,533, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,400,020 to Jones et al. that issued on Mar. 21, 1995. The Patent describes an advance notification system with a BSCU controller for messaging through a telephone system. The flow chart in FIG. 13 shows a duel means of communication, both a telephone 45 m and a computer with a telephone connection 45 f (via a modem). By offering dual means of messaging to a stop, the likelihood of reaching or getting through to a user increases. In accordance with the user request when signing-up for the service (FIG. 39), the end-user can choose any combinations of, but not limited to, a telephone call with a voice message 170, a telephone call using a distinctive ringing sound 171, a computer message over a network 172, additional on-screen display/s 173, and an additional audio message/s 174., 152745=A second method for a user to learn of the impending arrival information of a package delivery may be accomplished by a user accessing and requesting information through a computer network, for instance, the Internet, from the BSCU 14 through an Internet site or home page. The BSCU 14 software is designed to be added to the existing Internet site pages, which are owned and operated by delivery companies. When a user accesses a computer address (e.g. Internet site), the user may enter requests for a delivery by entering their telephone number, business or home address, or package identification number, for locating actual packages for delivery. If a delivery is to be made that day, an actual route list from each vehicle stored in the BSCU 14 is compared to the planned route and scheduled time of delivery (STD) database. The STD is a record of events from other routes, this record averages the time and distance to be traveled with the actual route in progress. Note: the STD records are from GPS sensor readings and the time between or travel time between each reading and not from completed routes from start to finish. Thus, by incorporating the STD with the actual delivery schedule, estimated time of delivery is established and accessible to a user requesting delivery schedule information. The advantages of offering a user a close approximate time of delivery are easily seen in these examples: a user needing to leave a delivery stop (home or business) for lunch or errands and expecting an important package to be delivered, or a user needing materials for an important meeting and knowing if the materials will be delivered before the scheduled meeting time. Upon receiving the information request from a user computer linked to the BSCU 14, a request for a vehicle, package, or user location (street address/location on a map), telephone number, computer address, etc. can be made available to the user to locate an area in which a delivery is going to be made. The vehicle associated with the delivery to this user business, or package identification number processes that delivery request. If a package is scheduled for delivery, the actual delivery vehicle estimated time of arrival is given to the user requesting the information in, but not limited to, two formats, one the time of day (1:45 PM) and/or a time count down (4:21:03). Additionally, people placing requests may be offered other services from the delivery companies, these requests are made available to the companies to increase revenues while providing the customers with more and better options on deliveries. One example of a user request is an express delivery request (EDR) option. An EDR becomes available through the existing advance notification system network by allowing customers to interact with the vehicle's driver through their computer connected to a network. A customer can send an EDR from their computer to the BSCU 14 over a computer network, then a live operator or preferably an automatic calculation of the driver's load, schedule (early or late), and location/distance from the address sending the EDR; The request is processed and a new estimated time of arrival can be given to the customer, with an optional additional fee from the delivery company. Additionally, a customer can look up a location on a route and meet the driver at a prior stop when an EDR is not used, thus shortening the driver's route time. Upon requesting an EDR, an estimated time of arrival is given to the user. At the same time a quoted fee (on-screen) based upon a flat rate or the actual delay time for that particular vehicle is given to the customer., 61318=This application is a divisional of application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In the claims hereafter, all \u201cmeans\u201d and \u201clogic\u201d elements are intended to include any structure, material, or design for accomplishing the functionality recited in connection with the corresponding element. Worth noting, actual pictures or live video taken from a vehicle could be sent to the BSCU 14 from the VCU 12 and then used as part of the messaging process of the impending arrival of a particular vehicle to a user. As wireless channels become capable of carrying more and more data (by increased band width and data compression routines), increased information taken from the vehicle can be utilized in the message of the impending arrival of a vehicle to the user. Furthermore, message timing and activation of impending arrival messages to users can be set at the start of the route or day, or in some cases the day/s before the vehicle is to arrive. By sending impending arrival messages early, users can rearrange their schedules for meeting a delivery vehicle/driver when he arrives. As an example, a person taking a lunch break or leaving a delivery area, will know of particular deliveries scheduled in a certain day and the impending arrival time/s. Moreover, companies may include the service without acknowledgment of the end user or in some cases notify them on one occasion and offer the service if they respond to the message. In these cases finding the contact information can be achieved by",
