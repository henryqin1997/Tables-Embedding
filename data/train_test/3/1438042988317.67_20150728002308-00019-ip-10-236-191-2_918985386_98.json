In my three years working for The Collegian, I've worked as a campus editor and a feature editor, allowing me to familiarize my self with the student body and administration. Most importantly, all my credits transferred to another university."

TCC is another tract that students can take in finishing their degrees, TCC offers so many different class times and locations, making it easier for busy students. Tips for prospective students Get involved on campus, though it seems difficult. Join a club or Honor Society or start your own club. Do not be ashamed for being a student at a community college, in the end you will not have near as many student loans as the other four year university grads! Bang for the buck TCC's tuition is very affordable! They make paying tuition a breeze by offering scholarships, loans, and payment options. Am enjoying being here",
