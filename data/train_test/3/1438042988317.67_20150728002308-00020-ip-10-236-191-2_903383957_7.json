            "In Florence there is hardly anything to do except for partying, which I do not recommend a lot of, bowling, bars, plays and movies. On campus there are plays, movies that are popular and a building called the UC (University Commons). This is the place where you could go swimming, play pool, basketballs games are held, and other fun events.",
            "The food here at Francis Marion Unversity is pretty good. There are two locations that you can choose from to eat. The Cafe is the main place freshmen and Sophomores go to eat. The food there are prepared but people who know how to cook! :) Then there is the Grille, this is the place where people have meetings, just come chill with their friends, watch games or just to grab a snack.",
