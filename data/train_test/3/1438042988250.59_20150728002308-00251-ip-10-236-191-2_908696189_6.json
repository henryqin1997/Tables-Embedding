            "Working adult or high school graduate",
            "Excellent band for the buck. I can not emphasize how much this school is recognized for especially for their nursing program. This semester I only paid for my books because my financial aid covered the rest.",
            "They have several different clubs available but not as much as your regular college. The students are great though I've made a ton of good friends this semester.",
            "There isn't a whole lot of food options at the school since it is small but there are tons of places to eat nearby!",
            "No on campus dorm life.",
            "Just because this school is a community college does not mean the classes are any easier. Their academics are just as creditable as any other school and they really have a great reputation!",
            "Use the resources available to you. Ivy Tech has tons of study group and help offered in the learning center. Use it!",
            "Ivy Tech is a small school but very well recognized and the students and staff are great. It's very affordable and a great place to get most of your core classes done at or a degree. Great school for the working adult."
