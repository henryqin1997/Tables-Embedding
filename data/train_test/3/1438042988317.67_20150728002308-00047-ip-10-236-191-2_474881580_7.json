In the drawing, numeral 100 designates a codebook which stores sets of parameter values of respective mouth shape model images which show geometrical characteristics of a mouth in response to phoneme signals, numeral 101 a memory which stores mouth shape image information of pixels of the mouth part defined by the respective sets of parameter values stored in the codebook 100, and numeral 102 a combining section adapted to modify the mouth shape image information read out from the memory 101 in accordance with the parameter values from the codebook 100 and to combine it with face image information excluding the mouth shape image information of pixels of the face part received from the transmission side. Numeral 103 denotes an initializing apparatus including a normalization codebook for initializing the codebook 100 in response to the initial face image information.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes It is further understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing description is a preferred embodiment of the disclosed device and that various changes and modifications may be made in the invention without departing from the spirite and scope thereof. As explained above, according to the present invention, since the input image is separated into the object image and the background image, and the background image is transmitted only when required, whereby the volume of transmission information may be reduced. As to the object image, after the three dimensional shape model is adjusted, mean value separation normalizing vector-quantization is executed at the patch quantizing section by using a multiplicity of vector patterns for the respective patches stored in the code book and therefore images of a high quantity may not only be transmitted without being affected by rigorous movement of the object and change in the illumination condition but may also be transmitted at a low bit rate. Further, since the normalized vectors have been registered in the codebook, a shape image may be transferred with little reflection of the statistical nature of the input image. Furthermore, since the object image may be combined with any optional background image stored in the background image memory in the receiver side, an image constitution effect is higher than in that of the prior art. Furthermore, although a human face image has been discussed as the",
