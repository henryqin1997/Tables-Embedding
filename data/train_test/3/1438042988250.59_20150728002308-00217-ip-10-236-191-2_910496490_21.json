            "it's not easy being a biology student. the classes are challenging, but the teachers are willing to help and the material is wonderful. the language teachers that taught my class were wonderful and helped me understand and appreciate the language. the biology teachers made the classes interesting. during j-term (a class shoved into about three weeks during january) i had to take the class animal form and function. it was a difficult class but it was a lot of fun, so no matter what you have heard, do not worry! the teachers all have a sense of humor and you can get through the class! the classes i am currently taking are teaching me quite a bit as well. all the classes are instructive and fun."

Stepping outside of the US is an experience that will blow you away., 150358=If you show interest in the school beforehand, your online application fee will be waived. This is only if you apply early, around November., 42430=--apply early with the rolling admissions --stay overnight for free in one of the dorms with a current student ----meet with a professor in your department of interest --visit the campus more than once to get a true view of what's going on --look up class pages on Facebook such as Messiah College Class of 2015 to get to know others --explore the surrounding area on campus visits --come prepared with a list of questions, especially on open house days when there are group tours, 259863=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 199550=Creeking- prepare to get thrown in the creek on your birthday. Mine was on December 1st and they still did it. Midnight scream- Everyone screams at midnight during finals week. And many others..., 2961=Messiah is less expensive and more liberal than many of the other private Christian Colleges, and is bigger and/or much more diverse than Malone, Cedarville, EMU or Grove City. It is fairly easy to get a scholarship there if you have decent grades, and it has more majors than many of the other Christian Colleges. Included in each students bill is a student government and student activities fee. So, you don't have to worry about paying for each sorority or fraternity or group you would like to join. The groups that need money are given a budget, so you hardly ever have to pay to join or get involved (unless you need equipment or something). This makes it easy for you to do all the activities you would like, while still being able to afford the meal plan. Maybe. Our meal plan is expensive, and each freshman and sophomore must purchase the without limits ultra meal plan--or one that costs exactly the same as it. The food is really good, and you have TONS of options (just look at the menu if you are curious-we have even more than it shows). And, the dining hall is open from 7 AM to 7:30 PM, so it is very convenient, and something is always there that is good to eat. It is just expensive. But do not fear! When you are a junior, senior, or living in off-campus housing, you will not have to pay so much because you are not required to buy a meal plan (but you won't have quite as good meals, unless you are a good chef).}",

Tips for prospective students Try to get as much financial help you can as well as scholarships! Don't wait till your senior year to start looking for help! Start now!!! Another tip would be to start practicing writing papers with real meat in them. Professors can spot a poorly written paper a mile away. If you can get this down you'll be fine in writing those 5-10 page papers about a topic you can't stand. Another thing is that if you're a nursing or engineering major get in your application early because those are the first two majors to get filled! One final thing would be that if you find out you're bored on campus get involved in a club! There's plenty of clubs around campus",
