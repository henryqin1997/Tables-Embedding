Yet that first spring mowing, usually in late March, begins your most important annual lawn duties. The first mowing makes the lawn look spring-like and very attractive.\u00a0 Subsequent regular mowing hardens the grass for drought and heat stresses later on. So when the first clump of grass grows above the mowing height, mow, even if a lot of the yard doesn\u2019t need to be mowed yet.}",
