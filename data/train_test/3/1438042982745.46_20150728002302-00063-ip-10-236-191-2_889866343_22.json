It was #1 the year before that, but the campus itself is relatively safe. The school spends a lot of money for campus security each year. There are small golf-cart-like cars called STRIPES that patrol the campus after 6PM. If students don't feel safe at night, they can also call STRIPES (starting at 6PM) to get rides to locations within the campus. Greek Life",
