            "Appleton is one of the safest places in the U.S., so there shouldn't be any worries about safety at Lawrence.",
            "We have lots of different clubs on campus. No matter who you are, you will definitely find one that is for you. I myself really enjoy coming over to nursing home with GlamourGals club, where we provide beauty makeovers and companionship to elderly women. Another favourite club of mine is Cultural Food Club, they cook foods from different countries once every month, and other people can come to eat these foods or even to learn how to make them!",
            "I'd say our dining service is pretty good - the food is healthy and delicious at the same time. We have options for everyone - meat-eater, vegetarian, vegan. Our food is very culturally diverse as well; besides american food, we also have foods cooked in other countries' styles - Vietnamese banh mi, Japanese miso soup, Indian curry,... Also, the school is pretty easy about eating and dining; you can go to Andrew Commons, our dining hall, eat there or get a plate and bring it to wherever you want, and come back to get more food without swiping your card for another time.",
            "There are a lot of choices for dorm, depends on your interest. If you want to live close to the academic buildings, so that you will have a little more time chilling on your bed in the morning, go for Ormsby. If you care more about eating, Sage - the dorm right next to the cafeteria and the dining hall - will be the best choice. And there are more than ten other dorms and houses for you to choose. Each dorm usually has a common lounge, a computer lab, a common kitchen, a laundry room, and some practice rooms with pianos (for students in the Conservatory to practice, but other students are free to play piano too). There are quiet hours when people may not make loud noises; these quiet hours are voted by residents, and thus vary by dorms. Students are allowed to have small pets, such as fish, turtle, on condition that they get the agreement from everyone who lives on the same floor as them.",
            "Lawrence is very academically challenging. In 2011, we ranked 18th in most rigorous U.S. colleges, right under Harvard, and above Yale, Princeton, and Stanford. Also, the 10 week trimester makes things a little bit harder as well - time will go by so fast, you have to work hard to understand the materials in classes in very little time. However, you will learn how to work effectively and manage your time. The professors at Lawrence are very understanding and supportive as well. They are always willing to help their students, and really want to see their students succeed. Thus, be diligent, and you will be fine."

It's tough, but worth it., 19546=Never once have I felt unsafe, even walking across campus in the middle of winter at 4:30 AM., 59431=Oktoberfest takes over College Avenue every year, and is extremely well-attended by students. Lawrence students participate heavily in the Midwest Trivia Contest, which is an experience that can not be explained in writing. LUaRoo is a mini-music festival held each spring, and popular campus bands as well as outside acts are invited to play. My favorite tradition is senior streak, in which the senior class attends a final Senior Night at the Viking Room in June and then collectively streak through campus. Underclassmen often line the exit of the VR to cheer on their friends. The one famous location on campus is the large steeple/tower on top of Main Hall that is featured in the majority of photos of the campus. To students this structure is known as the Nipple of Knowledge., 163755=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 90599=Lawrence is very academically challenging.

It isn't terrible (though this winter - 2014 - has been unusually bad) because it means that you have to be very productive. When there's no incentive to go outside, you're more likely to do your homework inside. Bring layers and something to cover your face, that's the part that is the most uncomfortable when it's exposed.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Its expensive, but worth it. Will enjoy being here A huge turn off is the weather. Lawrence is right on a river so the wind chill is crazy. That being said, Appleton is a fun town. Personally I think its really cool that such a small town gets Broadway tours just like a big city. Will learn a lot My mom went to Lawrence and she and all of her classmates are amazing, intelligent people that have gone far. My mom has her PhD and has a friend in the Bankok Orchestra. Whenever I have gone to the campus, I've really loved that they have the conservatory of music integrated into the rest of the school. My mom was a pre-med major with a minor in theatre and that isn't uncommon. A girl from my town who is a freshman there now says it hasn't changed. She's currently doing freshman seminars, where a physics professor is studying the Odyssey with them with a totally different perspective that a Lit professor.
