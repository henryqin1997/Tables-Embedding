The third slot on a player\u2019s roster should go to Clint Bowyer, Kyle Busch, or Kasey Kahne all of whom are slightly more affordable. Busch has been the hardest charger as determined by fastest laps run. He has been the swiftest 5.5 percent of the time and has also led 5.3 percent of the laps since 2005. If he is too expensive, however, Bowyer is a good alternative; he has led 3.3 percent of the laps in the past 17 races and scored an identical percentage of fastest laps run.

    "textAfterTable": "The Favorites In regard to fastest laps run, two drivers stand head and shoulders above the rest. Fortunately, they are the same drivers with the best recent top-five finish percentage, so fantasy owners have an opportunity to double-down and score points in every column. Hendrick Motorsports teammates Jeff Gordon and Jimmie Johnson have dominated Martinsville unlike any other drivers in the field on any other track. Since NASCAR Statistical Services began tracking this statistic, Gordon has recorded 968 fastest laps run of the 6,819 available in the past 17 races. That works out to 14.2 percent of the time. Johnson has recorded the fastest lap in 13 percent of the circuits, and these drivers will almost certainly combine for that same 27 percent of the available points this week.\u00a0 Along the way, they have spent the majority of their time in the front of the pack.
