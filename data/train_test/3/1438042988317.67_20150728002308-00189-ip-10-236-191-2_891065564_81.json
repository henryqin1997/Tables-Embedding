            "Safety is a top priority at SFSU. You feel welcomed and safe even before you are on campus. Police officers are constantly on the lookout for strange behavior to ensure your safety. I appreciate and thank them for such a strong presence that takes away the worry and puts the focus on my studies and my life as a student.",
            "Live and present, yet respectful and controlled. With such a diverse student community, clubs and fraternities as well as sororities are great ways of knowing people and connecting academically as well as socially. Students here are aware of the hard work needed to maintain a student standing status and will not jeopardize it by partying.",
            "I have to say that I am most impressed by the availability of clubs and their corresponding activities. There are always events going on pertaining to a club and or a major. Everyone is encouraged to partake in most of the clubs and to make their college experience great one.",
            "Multicultural and polyglots. SFSU is a melting pot in it's own. There are people from all over the country and the world who are attracted by the feeling of laisser faire that city is known for. It's a school and a city all at once.",
            "There is a celebration for the Chinese New Year. for international students, there are always gatherings around the city to get to know each other better and create friendships and or connections. there are also language clubs that offer language exchange experiences at no cost to you.",
            "SFSU can be pricey if you do not have your finances under control. There are always events going on, fairs and farmer's markets as well as a Belgium waffle truck that can be tempting if you are around, however, all that is provided are simple necessities that can be found on the Mall with is right across the street from campus.so, even if it can be expensive, it does not have to be so.",
            "There are classes offered of almost every sportive activity. If music and dancing are your thing, those classes are also offered. SFSU is located on Lake Merced and it's a beautiful stroll to take at any time of day.",
            "There is a food court that offer everything from coffee and pastries, to Mexican food and Middle Eastern dishes. I personally enjoy eating at the food court, there's a variety of food and the quality is great. I have never had any complaints.",
            "There are about 3 different cafeterias for dorm residents only (not counting the food court for every other student.) There are rules that have to be followed and they will be enforced. Most students are on the same wavelength and from different backgrounds and economical status, they are fun and friendly.",
            "Academically, SFSU is highly competitive. There are students from all over the world trying to better themselves by attending college. Faculty focuses on guidelines and encourage them to be followed.",
            "Make sure you get in contact with the financial aid office before you move to or start attending SFSU. I was able to talk to the director of the program and explained my current financial situation and he made sure I applied to every scholarship to ensure that I attended school without as much of a financial burden.",
            "I will give San Francisco State University a rating of 8/10. They have successfully and amicably sent me abroad to Paris France through one of their many partner universities in the city. My experience at State has been a great one with staff and teachers who are willing to give you their time and guide on the right path towards a successful career."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{342921=San Francisco State tuition fee is reasonable in its price, although I heard tuition fee will increase in the next fall 2013., 475762=For expecting students I would advise to never have too much fun. College is about exploring and having fun and I cannot stress how much better your college experience will be if you just remember to have fun. When you wake up at 7:59 A.M. for your 8 o'clock morning class, instead of dwelling about it, make the best of it. You only get one real college experience so you might as well make the best of it., 299941=Not that everyone is living in the dorm. It's mostly for freshman, sophomore, and transfers. Still, the dorm is so convenient, fun and quite random. You mostly will find tons of drama with your roommate and random things int he hall way, such as people in costume in the middle of March or people dancing, singing or playing guitar on the small quad. Not a good place for quiet and clean freak people., 172316=If you have considered this school i hope you have considered the cost of living in the City, the dorms are expensive and rent at even the cheapest of apartments are upwards of $2100 a month, for one bedrooms and studios. On the other hand, receiving a college education and life experiences a city like San Francisco will put you through are priceless...., 330779=The food at the college leaves alot to be desired. However, there are many types of foods to choose from...from extremely healthy to extremely fattening. The cafeteria is always full and robust. Get there before 11:50 am. That's when the large crowd begins to fall into the cafeteria and if you have a class at 12:20, you may be pushing it. If all else fails, there are a few cafe type establishments at the head of the school and in the HSS building on the first floor. Plenty of vending machines if you're pressed for time or pack a lunch the night before and bring it with you. Lunch on campus is a little expensive., 111218=Sign up for the dorms before January of the year you are planning on attending., 708894=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 431573=Every October a group of people dressed as zombies attack people., 332392=Some classes can be challenging, especially if some classes are cross-listed. It's all relevant. Just be a sponge and don't fall into the trap of procrastination. You're grade can turn out to be a C when you are clearly A material. There are lots of group projects in upper division and just like any place of employment, there will always be one or two that are 'slackers' or give the bare minimum. Do not let that stop YOUR progress and grade. If you see something needs to be done by another person, just do it yourself or get assistance from others within your group. I had a 'group' that started out with four people and ended up a 'me' project. Everyone had excuses on why they couldn't or didn't do their part. I didn't let that stop me. I did everyone's section and I received an A+. Believe in yourself and your abilities. If you are not sure, seek out a tutor. Remember, this is your life at stake because when it's all said and done, many of these students you may never see again, and it will be only you holding the torch. March to victory, NEVER settle for defeat from merely not trying., 19849=Attend office hours, attend office hours, attend office hours. Professors stay overtime to answer your questions, and most of them want your money to go to actually learning something. Take advantage. Don't miss class. It's tempting to sleep through your morning classes, yes, but don't forget that you're paying for those. Know your sleeping schedule before registering. If it isn't realistic for you to get up at 8:10 every Monday for a Math class, then don't register for that class. Register early.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Classes that are offered here at state are interesting. ALL professors here at state are passionate about their discipline and they are very helpful! We have great and supportive departments. I am a Biology major at state with hopes of attending UCSF for med school and they provide a lot of support. The Biology department is one of the best in the CSU system since SFSU has a lot of connections with Biotech companies in the bay area and health care companies. The Biology department is ranked #3 in the public universities when I read reviews about it.
