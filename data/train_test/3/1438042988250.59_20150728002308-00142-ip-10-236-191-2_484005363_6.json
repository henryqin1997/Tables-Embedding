Accordingly, this invention is not to be regarded as limited to the embodiment disclosed herein, but is to be limited only as defined by the appended claims. By virtue of the foregoing construction, the invention has provided a matrix of microwave passages for the distribution and combination of electromagnetic waves. The construction can be accomplished by automatic milling machinery to provide repeatably accurate assemblies of waveguides interconnected by coupling apertures. The construction provides for a crossing over of electromagnetic power from one waveguide to another within a common planar structure without the need for any passages for electromagnetic waves located outside of the planar configuration. By way of further description of the operation of the assembly 46, the input ports 68 have been further identified in FIG. 7 by the legends (1L, 4R) to (4L, 1R) identify specific ones of the eight beams to be generated by the antenna 58 in response to the application of an electromagnetic wave to any one of the various input ports 68. The numeral 1 indicates a beam which is directed close to boresight 70, while the numerals 2, 3 , and 4 represent larger angles of beam inclination relative to boresight 70. The letters L and R indicate that the",
