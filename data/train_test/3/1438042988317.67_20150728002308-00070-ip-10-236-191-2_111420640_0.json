    "textBeforeTable": "DOFOLLOW COMMENTLUV DOFOLLOW KEYWORDS BLOGS If you know of any I\u2019ve missed please leave details including links in the comments of this post. NOTE: I am currently in the process of updating the original table by moving blogs that qualify into each featured section below. The placeholders in the table are temporary \u2013 there so that I may add new DoFollow CommentLuv blogs I find in my research. TIP: Point at the blog link for a short bio or my personal recommendation. I will keep adding these until they\u2019re all done as time allows. I do wish Twitterfeed would improve their system though because it appears to be sending all the tweets almost immediately instead of pulling the feeds as we configure it to do. It might be a good idea to consider using dlvr.it instead as some influential bloggers are. I encourage other bloggers to support their favorite blogs by feeding their content. We are all far too busy to manually do this and at least until it seems overwhelming (which it hasn\u2019t so far) automating this just makes sense to me. I have had zero complaints so far and the quality content I feed often ends up featured in the various Twitter papers and gets RTed \u2013 sometimes even going viral for the blogger",
