    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{22416=The study described in this paper investigated how the major stakeholders of a teacher education institution responded to a particular suite of educational products that involved video-based educational learning objects. It aims to look into stakeholder attitudes to potential technological development in fostering student-centred learning in general and problem-based learning (PBL) in particular, with the ultimate goal of enhancing and improving the quality of teacher training. The research objectives are specifically focused upon (a) the experience of the major stakeholders when using multimedia technology and PBL pedagogy; (b) perceived benefits and challenges when applying the courseware in actual teaching situations; and (c) the possibility of these video-rich PBL cases being adjusted to better suit stakeholder needs and encourage their wider use in the particular context of this Chinese teacher education institution. The results show that previous training can exert a significant influence on the adoption of PBL by teachers and students. The data analysis is expected to form a useful baseline for a longitudinal study to determine the extent to which such multimedia educational courseware can affect the processes of learning, and to identify the learning outcomes that may be achievable through video-rich learning objects. \u00c2\u00a9 2013., 45867=This paper serves as an introduction to the Forum on Environmental Ethics. The Forum is built around contributions to the Environmental Ethics Symposium within the 10th Pacific Science Inter-Congress, held in Guam, USA 1-6 June 2001. The contributions to the Symposium differed in commitment and intent and this diversity has been enhanced by the addition of several additional papers to this Forum. The paper suggests a view of action as resulting from the interaction between often unexamined values, goes on to comment on the role of values in science classrooms, and applies both to a general treatment of Environmental Ethics. The paper then positions the remaining contributions to the Forum and concludes with a substantial bibliography which should prove useful to any readers wishing to dip deeper into Environmental Ethics., 40440=The approach of problem-based learning (PBL) possesses numerous differences when compared with the conventional ways of learning. However, few of the studies seem to tackle the underlying assumptions of PBL and relate it to the local context when it applies to different groups of learners in a particular discipline, such as education professionals in Hong Kong. This paper will, therefore, analyse the teacher educators' attitudes to the five newly developed video triggers on PBL, which were developed by education professionals at the Hong Kong Institute of Education to serve as exemplars for the teaching staff who are not familiar with the problem-based approach. The study intends to find out the teacher educators' perceptions of the use of media-based educational triggers in this teacher education institute, and what their attitudes are to this particular educational product's potential technological development in fostering student-centred learning in general and problem-based learning in particular, with the ultimate goal of enhancing and improving the quality of teacher training. The results show that pre-requisite training can exert a significant influence on the adoption of PBL by the Chinese teachers and students. \u00c2\u00a9 2007 Angela Ma Kit Fong, John Mitchell O'Toole and Mike Keppell., 30509=This paper was written as the Australian Science Curriculum settled into use in smaller Australian states, was being interpreted in different ways by statutory curriculum authorities in the larger ones and was forming the basis of adaptations of existing state-based resources by educational publishers. The paper takes the role of science educators of Christian commitment as its starting point. Such people operate at both secondary and tertiary levels and all face the challenges implicit in teaching a subject that is popularly supposed to conflirt with their faith. What do the churning flows of influence, authority and power that characterise the contemporary Australian educational scene mean for such people? The article considers the constitutional framework within which this churn occurs and the impact that nominally Christian institutions have had on its interpretation. How did we come to this? It considers the tensions that characterise the present situation. What constraints are being applied and how much room will we have to move? The paper considers the possibilities those tensions open up. How may we best be true to the gospel we profess and the families we serve? \u00c2\u00a9 2011 The Australian Christian Education Forum., 25506=The ability to recognise words from the aural modality is a critical aspect of successful second language (L2) listening comprehension. However, little research has been reported on computer-mediated development of L2 word recognition from speech in L2 learning contexts. This report describes the development of an innovative computer application to improve L2 word recognition from speech, and goes on to describe an exploratory study of its use by 33 English as a second language (ESL) students. The study detected significant differences between word recognition scores measured before and after participants used the application. The manner with which students engaged with the computer application in terms of word recognition, self-determined exposure to speech input (repetitions) and modified output productivity (revisions) are also described and analysed. Differences in engagement by learners with different word recognition capabilities are noted. The paper concludes with a discussion of some recommendations for the use of computer-assisted development of L2 word recognition from speech and also provides concrete suggestions for much needed further empirical research in this area. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Taylor & Francis., 81615=Copyright 2015 CRICOS Provider Number 00109J The University of Newcastle, Australia}",

This has included fifteen years in universities in Australia and the People's Republic of China and thirteen years as science co-ordinator in various schools. These schools ranged across the age (K-12, 7-10 and 7-12) and system spectra (catholic systemic, catholic independent and independent systems). He has also worked as language across the curriculum co-ordinator in a state high school.Mitch's major research interest, communication in science contexts, has arisen directly from this diverse background and continues to inform his practice as he prepares science teachers at this university.
