            "There are no dormitories.",
            "The teachers teach down to the lowest person in the class. Even if there is a pre-req for the course, you will often not cover what you should in the class because the instructor will spend too much time backtracking over stuff students are expected to already know.",
            "Get out while you can!",
            "I would not recommend this school to anyone that has not struggled their way through high school. The teachers teach really far down and tuition is incredibly overpriced for what you get out of it. Support staff are uncaring."

I was on the fence my ehole high school career, and BCC really helped me pinpoint what I love to do, and what I'm best at, which is Writing. Tips for prospective students Apply as soon as you can! It is important to meet with an advisor so that he or she can get you on the right track. Be sure to only take on what you can handle.
