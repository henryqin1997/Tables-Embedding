Some selected application roles share the same name as responsibilities for Siebel CRM and Oracle EBS applications and roles for PeopleSoft applications. A user who has any of these responsibilities or roles in the source application will be a member of the corresponding application role automatically upon logging in to the Oracle BI application. Other application roles based on similar objects in the source application can be added to the policy store, and then added to these data-level application roles, if you need the corresponding data filters to apply to any additional group of users. Table 2-2 shows the application roles that are supported in Oracle BI Applications. 2.2.4 Data-Level Security Application Roles in Oracle BI Applications User HR Organizations This initialization block is used to retrieve the current HR organization from OLTP application to which the current user belongs. This initialization block populates a variable called USER_HR_ORG.

    "textAfterTable": "2.2.5 About Data-Level Security Design in Oracle BI Applications As discussed in the preceding sections, Oracle BI Applications maintains data-level security application roles that are assigned dynamically to every user at the session level. Each application role has a set of filters associated with it that determines the data each user is allowed to see. A user is assigned an application role through the Authorization initialization block, as discussed in Section 2.2.3, \"Initialization Blocks Used for Data-Level Security in Oracle BI Applications.\" The data security design has the following features: Drill down. The user can drill down on a particular position in the position hierarchy to slice the data by the next position level in the hierarchy. For example, if the initial report is defined as: select Top Level Position, Revenue from RevenueStar then by drilling down on a value of MyPosition in the TopLevelPosition hierarchy, the report will become: Select Level8 Position, Revenue, where TopLevelPosition = 'MyPosition' Personalized reports. Users at different levels of the Position hierarchy can use the same Position-based reports but with each user seeing the data corresponding to his or her level. In such reports, Position is a dynamic column. For example, if a report is defined as: select Position, Revenue from RevenueStar the logical",
