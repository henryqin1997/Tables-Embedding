            "NYU is committed to keeping its students safe. There are NYU buses to take you from the further dorms to campus. There is Public Safety that you can call to transport you at night if you need help/feel uncomfortable traveling from the library to your dorm (for example).",
            "It was difficult to make friends during my freshman year at school but after joining NYU's Greek Life, the community became so much smaller and intimate. I now see people around campus everywhere I go, which is a nice, comforting feeling. Greek Life at NYU is very involved in philanthropic endeavors throughout the city. Mixers are held at bars and clubs in the city and are always a lot of fun. The opportunity to make connections is amazing; I started working at my first major internship because it was handed down to me from a sister. Greek Life at NYU is growing!",
            "There's a club for everyone! So many on-campus activities throughout the week. Dorms usually have fun outings and activities planned as well, such as cheap tickets to the US Open during Welcome Week!",
            "Outgoing, go-getter and highly motivated individuals.",
            "There are many unusual....clubs at NYU. There is a club for everyone and every interest. I have seen Larping on campus and NYU was a top team in the Quidditch World Cup.",
            "Again, it's what you make of it. At NYU you are paying for the opportunity to intern and develop a career while you're in college. I've been interning since my freshman year in school and have made so many great connections that I can rely on when looking for a job during my senior year.",
            "Join a club! Get involved in Greek Life! Get a fake ID so that you can take advantage of the nightlife in NYC. Go for a run in Central Park or along the West Side Highway. Walk along the Highline. Go to dinner with friends....etc",
            "Meal plans are pretty expensive at NYU. I suggest getting a 'Flex' meal plan which gives you a certain amount of meal credits per semester; much better than purchasing a '14 meal per week' plan in which your meals do not roll over if you don't use them. Kimmel and Palladium are the best dining halls, in my opinion, because they are very clean and the food is made in front of you.",
            "Dorm life at NYU is fun. Many freshman live on or near campus with the upperclassmen living in off campus dorms or in apartments throughout the city. Dorms are typically near dining halls. It's really what you make of it; try to immerse yourself in as many dorm programs as possible so that you can meet new/more people.",
            "Truth be told, the academic rigor depends on what major you choose and how hard you work at it. Like any major at any institution, the more you put into it, the more you get out of it. It's difficult to get A's, but not impossible, just apply yourself...and make yourself known to the professors on day 1.",
            "NYU is a large school in a large city. Be active. Join clubs, be a member of your dorm's hall council, or join Greek Life. By incorporating yourself into clubs like these, the NYU community will feel much smaller, and you'll have the ability to easily make friends and network.",
            "The expense of NYU is well worth the opportunity to live, intern and work in New York City; the connections you will make here are incredible. NYU does not offer a lot of scholarship money or financial aid, so be prepared to look for alternative resources to fund your college career. Apply to a school within NYU, try not to get stuck in the Liberal Studies Program for your first two years, even if you are unsure of your intended college/career path."

I wasn't very enthusiastic before I came to NYU, even though I had accepted a few months ago. I wasn't even enthusiastic in August, the few weeks before I came to New York. I was terrified and starting to wonder if I'd made the right decision for me. That all changed the first week. I made friends, I met super interesting and creative people, I explored the city, and I was energized. There's nothing like being in New York City with amazing people in your college years. You have the whole world ahead of you, and the city isn't as scary as it seems (coming from someone whose hometown has 8000 people)., 13972=Academically speaking, New York University is somewhat of a hodgepodge in quality between its different schools, so make sure you apply to the right one with the right credentials. Among its more renowned branches include: The Tisch School of the Arts: Founded and supported by the late Laurence Tisch (who, by the way, graduated from what is now Stern) and his family, the Tisch School is known as the #1 film school in the U.S. That said, If you're applying here, make sure you've got artistic chops. You will need a strong portfolio that should blow people away with its creativity and uniqueness, and know that you are competing against the best amateur film makers and artists around the globe. On the bright side, standardized scores and figures aren't emphasized, so a low GPA and SAT aren't that hazardous. Known graduates include Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Oliver Stone, and even Angelina Jolie. Left-handedness is preferred. The Stern School of Business: Known for producing investment bankers that go on to work for Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, etc, the Stern school is filled with people with great mathematical skills with good GPA's and high SAT scores. Aim for a > 3.6 GPA, > 2100 SAT and > 720 on SAT II's. Known graduates include: John Paulson, Robert Soros, Alan Greenspan. NYU's College of Arts & Sciences is a bit trickier than the other two schools, but its strong points include the Courant Department of Mathematics (#1 in applied math, USNWR), Philosophy and Economics. You can study anything here and the requirements are significantly lower than the previously mentioned schools. Aim for >3.4 GPA, >1900 SAT, >650 SAT II's. Gallatin is the school where you can create your own major. You have access to every course at NYU, so you can mix and match things around and end up as a specialist in Indian Agriculture. While the atmosphere here is extremely liberal, I would advise against applying to this school unless you are very independent. Keep in mind, if you wanted to major in Finance or a something in NYU's specialized schools (Tisch & Stern), you would have to do an internal transfer. Requirements are about the same as CAS Polytechnic is the new engineering branch for NYU. Since the school has just been incorporated in to the system, I expect that its requirements would be a little lower than CAS. There you go, a whirlwind tour of NYU's departments. Good luck on your application., 778748=I believe theres about 1000 clubs to choose from, you'll find something!, 244778=Not an unusual tradition, but the 2011 welcome week dance was Lady Gaga themed - called the Monster Ball. People went all out for this dance - some friends and I actually made our dresses out of duct tape!, 754581=Types of students that don't want the typical college experience of going to sports games and everyone in NYU attire. it's great for hipsters, people who march to their own drum, girls who are independent and like to dress up for class, and definitely international students., 538159=During May, there is what is called NYU Strawberry Festival. Basically, it is a celebration of springtime. Many free things are handed out, there is music, and you can see the very long strawberry cake that they have for you taste., 342810=It varies from hall to hall. Weinstein has the only Chick-Fil-A in the city (as of 2014 anyway). There's also a Subway and Jamba Juice in Weinstein. There's also an on-campus Starbucks that accepts Dining Dollars (a component of the NYU meal plan that all freshmen are required to sign up for). Palladium has an awesome all-you-can-eat Sunday brunch with a chocolate fountain, a bagel bar (bagels, smoked salmon, a few types of cream cheese, and scallions), fruit bowls, omelettes, and of course, cereal, eggs, and tater tots. Third North is supposed to be the worst dining hall, but I think we have it pretty good here if people say that. I always see a lot of people at Third North, and I personally like it. The pizza is the best of NYU (in my opinion), and their breakfast wraps are amazing. They also have incredibly addicting chocolate chip cookies. I swear, you can't stop at one. You have to have at least two cookies., 337289=There's a public safety bus that will take you from any NYU location to another from 12:00-7:00AM (I think those are the hours, I forget when the morning ones end). It's also very safe around campus though. There are scattered police on the streets. There are also other students. In general, Greenwich Village (where NYU is located) is a nice area of NYC. Just don't be stupid and you'll be fine. I usually walk back from the library with friends anyway because I don't like walking alone., 705191=Depends on how much tuition is for you, but the teachers here will make it worth your while. The only slight negative effect is that NYU has plans to expand their campus by 2031, and there's a lot of money being diverted to renovations and other things, all which take away from the scholarships that NYU offers. Look for other scholarships at Cappex!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students There is a certain mystique surrounding New York University and the city it encompasses. The lights, Broadway, instant access to the World's biggest hub. Dispel that notion immediately. While these events happen somewhat frequently, they do not come close to encapsulating the NYU experience. As a student, you must become independent immediately. The learning curve here is slightly steeper than many other colleges, but it's manageable if you take slow steps in finding your place in the school's culture. Also don't worry about not fitting in with certain crowds, there is a niche for every type of individual, but many of theme are somewhat liberal (this varies from school to school). Also note that NYU is an expensive place. By the end of four years, you will have spent $57,228 per year (assuming you dorm), which is $228,912 overall. The sticker shock, while intimidating, can be managed through a combination of loans, frugal spending, and financial aid. All of which can easily half the total figure.
