Enjoy. From the NEWS file in the distribution: changes in sbcl-0.9.1 relative to sbcl-0.9.0: * fixed cross-compiler leakages that prevented building a 32-bit target with a 64-bit host compiler. * fixed a bug in CLOSE :ABORT T: no longer attempts to remove files opened with :IF-EXISTS :OVERWRITE. * fixed bug 281: error for an invalid qualifier in a short-form method combination method is not signalled until the faulty method is called. * bug fix: iteration variable type inferrer failed to deal with open intervals. (reported by Alan Shields) * bug fix: dynamically loading (via LOAD-SHARED-OBJECT or similar) \"frameworks\" on Mac OS X no longer causes an EXC_BAD_ACCESS if two or more runtime options were provided to the sbcl binary. * compiled code is not steppable if COMPILATION-SPEED >= DEBUG. * contrib improvement: implement SB-POSIX:MKSTEMP (Yannick Gingras) * optimization: there's now a fast-path for fixnum arguments in the generic subtraction routines on x86/x86-64. (Thanks to Lutz Euler) * optimization: the code generated on x86-64 is more compact thanks to",
