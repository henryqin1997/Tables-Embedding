            "Chemeketa's campus police is around campus at all times. They even drive around school to make sure that everything is going smoothly.",
            "Chemeketa has over fifty clubs and organizations where you can meet other people.",
            "Chemeketa is involved in all sorts of sports competitions, it has a tennis court, a basketball court and volleyball court, gym, and a field for other sports like soccer or golf. Students can sign up for varsity and the college has over fifty clubs and organizations to meet other people.",
            "Food at Chemeketa is GREAT! Not only those Chemeketa have a food court that serves meals, various drinks, and other snacks (pizza, donuts, chips, etc. ) but there are other smaller shops around campus.",
            "Chemeketa's dorms are located behind the school. Housing is great because you're in close approximate to the city.",
            "Chemeketa's teachers are very enthusiastic about teaching their students. It means a lot to a student, when the teacher and the student have a great standing with each other. One of the best things about Chemeketa is that the classes are small, which makes it easier for the students to understand the classes better and the teacher can actually know your name. Other colleges probably have 200 students in one class fortunately, Chemeketa is not one of those colleges.",
            "One thing I'd recommend for anyone entering Chemeketa or even college in general is to be sure about your major. Being certain about your major can make it easier for you to find prospective four year colleges that you'd want to transfer to after and meet their requirements. If you're not sure, that fine; Chemeketa's advisers and counselors are there for that very reason: to help you.",
            "Chemeketa is one of those schools that values their students; they were very helpful when I was first starting college. They recommended the classes they I should take and would even help me meet the requirements of other colleges that I wanted to transfer to after I finished there. I would recommend Chemeketa to anyone who wants to get ahead of their job or to get the basics out of the way before they moved to a four year college."

    "textAfterTable": "Chemeketa is a really open place, I walked on campus my first day and I was feeling really nervous and then I started to see people that I knew and I met some really funny and outgoing people and it took my nerves away. Chemeketa has a broad atmosphere and you just love to be around. There are so many places to just hang out between classes and the art gallary is a fun place to go as well. Am learning a lot I've been at Chemeketa for one term now and I absolutely love it here. The teachers are always there to help you when you need it, there are many resources you can use if you don't exactly know where to turn to.
