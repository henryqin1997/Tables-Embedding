    "textAfterTable": "15 Songs Album Review Having succeeded in the '80s by drawing on '60s nostalgia with a song (\"Your Wildest Dreams\") and video, the Moody Blues in the '90s began tailoring entire shows to recapture their '60s glory days \u2014 and they succeeded. Performing on tour with a series of regional orchestras, they brought the majesty of their old studio sound onto the stage for the first time on songs like \"Nights in White Satin\" and \"Tuesday Afternoon,\" and audiences responded by turning them into one of the top concert draws of the decade. This album and the accompanying video are beautifully recorded (and the video looks gorgeous, too) and performed, and the group \u2014 caught amid the splendor of one of the prettiest outdoor concert venues in the West (Stevie Nicks has also done a video there) and with the orchestra backing them up on half the numbers, rise to the occasion with a drive and eloquence that they hadn't shown on-stage in many years. An essential recording and video for any fan of the group. Biography Formed: 1964 in Birmingham, England Genre: Rock Years Active: '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s, '00s, '10s Although they're best known today for their lush, lyrically and musically profound",
