    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{39332=In general, dorm life is pretty standard. There is a new housing model (will be starting in the 2012-2013 school year) that is intended to foster stronger bonds between people living in the same dorm. There is also a brand-new dorm on West Campus with beautiful rooms that people are very excited about., 109436=First of all, Duke is a very difficult school to get admission into. This school is the most selective university in the Southern United States. If you are submitting SAT scores, you MUST submit results of SAT II Subject Tests (2 tests required.) Failure to meet this will potentially jeopardize your application. To get in, you should have a consistent record of high academic achievement and perfect SAT scores for a competitive application. At the same time, don't worry if you don't have a 4.0 GPA and a 2400 SAT score - Duke's admissions are entirely holistic and are really much concerned who you are as a person. Strengths in other areas will compensate for grades that are less than ideal. Duke loves the academically motivated and intellectually curious student who is often willing to undertake challenges. That student should be able to be challenged by their peers/professors as much as they are willing to challenge them. Last of all, you should dedicate yourself to one or two activities you love and demonstrate only one thing: Impact. Remember that Duke, along with other universities such as Princeton, Yale, MIT all look for future leaders who are willing to make a difference in their community., 268411=- Go to the activity fair to see what is available for you to join on campus, and you get a lot of cool free stuff - Join Greek Life! - Go to as many sporting events as possible. Even if you are not that into sports, the energy and vibe at the games is something that makes Duke unique. - Try to ration your food points Freshman year, in March when you just can't possibly eat at the Marketplace any more you will be happy to still have another option -If you have a car, bring it. It's sometimes nice to get off-campus to go grocery shopping at the nearby Target or Kroger, and there are two malls about 10-20 minutes away, 222739=Tenting: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krzyzewskiville http://dukegroups.duke.edu/kville/k-ville-tenting-policy-2010-2011/, 280710=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 201991=Use your AP and IB credits; Duke is not somewhere you want to retake a course. Be prepared to be in the midst of literally 1500 high school valedictorians in your class alone. Everyone works hard and really cares about their performance, so don't think you'll be able to breeze through.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Sophomore from Florida 01/07/2010 Reviewer is A current student here. 52 out of 54 people found this review useful. 2 of 70 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Students who like small classroom settings, students who are willing to sit out on a few Friday nights in order to get some work done, and students who appreciate a competitive nature will excel at Duke. But most importantly, in order to really enjoy your time at Duke, you need to be relaxed and know how to balance work and play. Tips for prospective students 1. Whip out the Halloween costumes every other Saturday and attend football tailgates. 2. You HAVE to go to at least one basketball game and/or tent out for the UNC game, but don't forget to study the cheers beforehand. 3. Get your faculty in resident to approve you for a chapel climb. Don't forget to bring your camera. 4. If you're sick of the Marketplace or Great Hall, head over to Franklin Street for some great restaurants. 5. Study, study, study. Everyone pulls six hour shifts in Perkins Library, so don't feel like",
