            "Overall there are not a ton of crime/safety issues that come up on campus. When/if there is, the school and campus safety do a great job of communicating the incident among the entire community to create awareness. They constantly have officers patrolling campus. Overall I feel pretty safe walking anywhere on campus.",
            "While York is not a huge school and there is not a frat row type of set up among the Greek organizations, there is still a presence at York College. I am not personally involved with Greek life, but know several people who are and they all seem to enjoy it.",
            "There are lots of clubs on campus, and if you cannot find one you like, you could always start your own! My favorite activities are sporting events just because it is cool to see your classmates compete. I also enjoy nights when the Campus Activities Board (CAB) hosts movies, because you can save money by seeing the film right after it is released at school for free, instead of having to go to the theatre.",
            "York is great for student-athletes, because it provides top notch education and academic programs, as well as elite DIII NCAA regulated sports teams. The Grumbacher Sport and Fitness Center is more advanced than almost all other DIII schools, and comparable if not better than most DII schools. Everyone can fit in at York though. This school is not just great for any one type of student. Who ever you are, you can find your niche at York.",
            "There is a fountain in the middle of main campus and sometimes as a prank people put soap in the fountain and it gets filled with suds. There is a large rock at the center of campus and when you graduate, the school paints the rock green and every single graduate gets to paint their name, or something to remember them by following commencement.",
            "I looked at a lot of schools during my college search and York seemed to offer everything every other school did, but for less money. Not only that, but what really attracted me to York was their new/newly renovated facilities. For as old and historical as the city of York and the college is, you could never tell walking in to our Grumbacher Sports and Fitness Center, Wolf and Diehl Hall, or any building for that matter. The college is continually expanding and offering more for its students.",
            "The Campus Activities Board (CAB) always has cool things planned on campus for free, available to all students. There are always movies that have just come out being played, comedians, musicians, etc. Last year the college hosted guest speakers Mia Hamm and Maya Angelo, as well as Wiz Khalifa for our spring concert. There is a nearby ice skating rink, bowling alley, movie theatres, etc. Lancaster has a really nice mall not too far from school.",
            "There are two full dining halls on campus, along with several coffee shops, a sub shop, something equivalent to a Chipotle (burritos, quesadillas, etc.) and numerous vending machines. West Campus Commissionary, though not as large, has the best food in my opinion compared to Johnson's Dining Hall. Nearby,there is also a Chick-Fil-A, Chipotle, Panera Bread, Yorktown Pizza, and numerous other chain restaurants. Whatever you do, DO NOT ORDER FRANKS PIZZERIA FOR DELIVERY because it will literally take two hours for your order to be delivered and they have terrible service.",
            "As an incoming freshman, most people are housed in Manor North, South, East, or West, or the Penn/Beard Complex. Some people however are housed in Northside Commons. Northside is a newer building but has a mix of freshman sophomores and sometimes even juniors; which works and is fine, but the Manors and Penn/Beard complexes are more conducive to socializing and getting to know your classmates. I lived in Northside my freshman year and I loved it, but I know I would have gotten closer with some of the people in my class if I had lived in the Manors or Penn/Beard.",
            "While you do not fully realize their significance when you are deciding on which college to attend, small class sizes allow students to learn in a more intimate and productive environment. Not only that, but academics at York become easy when you have professors that are so hands on and willing to help when needed. As long as you go to class, do your assignments, and review your notes, academics at York are definitely do-able.",
            "College is what you make of it. If you join clubs, teams, organizations, etc., and get involved, you will meet tons of people and have great experiences. Don't be afraid to pursue the things that interest you. College is much different from high school in that, people appreciate diversity and originality; so go out there and do whatever it is that you do best.",
            "York College is the perfect mix of having a small enough population that you will see familiar faces and feel like you are a part of the community, but a large enough population that there are always new people to meet. I believe my decision to attend York College has been vital to my successes during my freshman year of college. York is my second home."

But once you become an upperclassmen there are so many other great options for you!, 156771=Apply early. They offer an application that can be sent in during the Summer of your junior year in high school. It is a great opportunity to get information earlier and be able to meet with prospective professors. For example, I sent my 2012 application in August 2011 and received information in October 2011. I was able to meet with my professors from my major and I had already received my application status saying I was accepted. You do not have to accept the acceptance letter at that time., 141969=not big partiers. Students to like classrooms with a ratio of 1:18 or at most 20. Students that like a sense of belonging to a small community., 113305=There is a wide variety of clubs on campus. There are clubs for majors, causes, religions, and just for fun. They have something for everyone's desires. We also have a wide variety of sports, but no football team. We like to say undefeated since 1787 because we've never had one at all.}",

I'm a business major and I think the program is great and the professors really know what they're talking about and they enjoy helping their students. Tips for prospective students Come visit the campus, and ask questions of the students at while on the tour to get a feel of how others feel about the school.
