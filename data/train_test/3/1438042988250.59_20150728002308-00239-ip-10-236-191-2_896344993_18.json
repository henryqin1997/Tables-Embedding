            "Since it takes about 7 minutes to walk the entire campus at a fairly leisurely pace- campus safety isn't INCREDIBLY needed at really any point. But they are very helpful and quick to respond whenever you do need them.",
            "Definitely check out the outing club- a lot of neat adventures get planned through there. The international club is cool too- you'd be amazed how many countries are represented on little tiny CSC campus!",
            "Nursing students. Partiers. Those who don't mind the campus being a ghost town a lot of weekends.",
            "Don't neglect to visit the greenhouse in Danforth! Really neat. Also be sure to spend at least a few hours studying in the upper lofts of the library but dress cool- it gets hot up there!",
            "I think the campus is gorgeous, and generally very very friendly. You are getting a solid education and in most majors can be proud to say you graduated from here. But I feel that it is way over priced considering location and lack of overall experience (not academically.) Maybe it would have been better had I been in-state.",
            "This is where I was a little disappointed. While the campus and surrounding town are lovely, everything shuts down early and all that is left to do is what is on campus. Sure there are clubs and events during the week and weekends alike, but if you aren't a partier there isn't really much else to do but stay in and watch movies or leave the campus. For those of you who dont have a car- I would make friends with someone who does. Unless you are outdoorsy and get a real kick out of going for walks and such (which I did) you may not find much else for you to do to get a break from a hard week.",
            "While there isn't always enormous variety, I really liked the food. Much better than I was expecting, even though more people tend to complain than not. I truly believe those folks just needed something to complain about. The dining staff is also really fun. You'll get to know, and be known, by all of them and not a morning goes by that Mama T isn't singing away. Omelette day and french toast day during the weekends are always looked forward to.",
            "Some of the dorms are fantastic, some are not. There is really soemthing for everyone based n what you intend to achieve while you're at home in your dorm. For something quieter try McKean (substance Free) or the newest dorm Danforth. Best and Burpee are always a bit lively and louder.",
            "While some of my courses were a major challenge, some were more of an open discussion, which is totally fine but I gave the three stars to demonstrate an evening out of the overall rigor. I was not a nursing student but I know THAT is a difficult major for sure. A lot of the professors are really interesting and down to earth which is nice.",
            "Scholarships scholarships scholarships! I can't stress this enough. Be sure to take advantage of the absolutely breathtakingly gorgeous library and all of it's resources. The staff there is wonderful and always willing to help in any way they can. Also don't be afraid to use the ADC (Academic Development Center) where you'll find tutoring, testing help, note taking tips, paper reviewing etc etc etc.",
            "While Colby-Sawyer has quite a bit to get involved with on campus (and a BEAUTIFUL campus at that) I have yet to understand why it is so gosh darned expensive. A great place for nursing students."

Fun day!, 23544=If you're looking for a place to have a great connection with teachers, a friendly and safe environment while having fun at the same time, Colby-Sawyer is the place for you.

Reviewer has been to campus. 2 out of 2 people found this review useful. 3 of 29 Categories Comments Will enjoy being here I slept over, attended a class, had a great time and I'm already considering myself as part of the community... It really is amazing!!!! Will learn a lot The advantage of being a rural school, is that the students will be more concentrated or focus on school than anything else that could keep them back from achieving their goals...
