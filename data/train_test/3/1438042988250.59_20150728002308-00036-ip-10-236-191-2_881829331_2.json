    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{32380=2/27/14: The Bears have a strong history built upon their defense. They are nicknamed the 'Monsters of the Midway' for good reason. Their 1985 Super Bowl winning team boasts one of the best defenses in NFL history, and that tradition continued under former head coach Lovie Smith. Mark Tressman took the reigns last season and Chicago had one of the better offenses in the league. Their defense, however, suffered. The Bears are looking to bolster the defense in the upcoming draft and may have their sights set on Kalil Mack from the University of Buffalo to be that dominant linebacker they need., 32996=2/20/14: The Bears are going to have to improve, particularly on the defensive side of the ball, if they are going to compete for the NFC North in 2014. That actually sounds strange for a team that has historically been known for dominant defenses. The Bears certainly felt the loss of longtime linebacker Brian Urlacher last season, but they also did not get enough pressure on opposing QBs. Chicago signed journeyman Austen Lang this past week to bolster depth on the defensive line. Lang is rather unheralded and may not provide much, but he is best known for writing about his emotions when he was cut from a previous team., 8396=12/3/14: The Bears continue to struggle this season and it showed again on Thanksgiving in a 34-17 loss to the host Detroit Lions. Chicago looked good early. A quick touchdown on their opening drive to Alshon Jeffery, followed by a strip-sack deep in Lion's territory led to another Jeffery touchdown. However, there was not much more after that. The Lions offense started clicking and their defense tightened up. A pair of Jay Cutler interceptions only hurt the cause. Chicago is now 5-7 and will be home in January. They have another Thursday game this week when they host the Dallas Cowboys., 34782=1/30/14: The Bears would love to keep defensive end Julius Peppers - heck, who wouldn't want him on their team. However, they are going to have a hard time keeping him under his current contract. Peppers is scheduled to make $18.2 million against the salary cap next season, which is simply too much money. The eight-time pro bowler led the team in sacks, but he only had 7.5 all of last season. Even releasing Peppers is costly, as he would still count for $4.2 million in dead money for 2014 and 2015. Chicago better hope Peppers is in a mood to restructure his contract., 9008=11/19/14: Because it is an easy story, the narrative leading up to the Bears' home game against the Minnesota Vikings has been how the team gave up over 50 points in two consecutive game, as well as Jay Cutler throwing interceptions. The defense stood tall against the Vikings and Cutler did not make big mistakes in the Bears 21-13 win. It was the first win for the team on their home field in all of calendar year 2014, meaning the Chicago Blackhawks had more wins than the Bears at Soldier Field until last Sunday. Chicago improved to 4-6 on the season and will host Tampa on Sunday., 43916=10/17/13: The Chicago Bears responded well to two consecutive losses by keeping the New York Giants winless with a 27-21 victory last Thursday night. The win puts the Bears at 4-2 on the season and in contention for the NFC North. It was a big game for the defense who picked off three Eli Manning passes and returned one for a touchdown. Brandon Marshall was back to form and contributed well with two touchdown receptions in the game as well. The Bears get an extra few days off and will play in Washington on Sunday October 20., 34195=2/6/14: This next season, 2014, could be a 'put up or shut up' year for the Chicago Bears. The team signed QB Jay Cutler to a long-term extension, so that position is locked up. They have some great playmakers on the roster with WRs Brandon Marshall and Alshon Jeffries, not mention running back Matt Forte. The offense is in tact and can be very effective if everyone is healthy. The defense figures to improve over last year (which is odd when speaking about the Bears), so this should be a team that contends for the NFC North title, and finally dethrones Green Bay., 28418=4/10/14: The Chicago Bears announced that they came to terms with offensive lineman Eben Britton on a one year contract. Britton was originally drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars out of the University of Arizona in the second round of the 2009 draft. While doing time with the Jags, he started 30 games over four seasons, split between right tackle and left guard. He joined the Bears in 2013, playing in 13 games and starting four. He played well and fit in with the Bears' scheme. He may get some extra time with the first team in the near future as starting right tackle Jordan Mills recovers from foot surgery., 54950=6/13/13: The last time the Bears were in the Super Bowl, the game was held in Miami. Since Miami is not renovating Dolphin Stadium, they appear to be out of the running to host future games. The Big Game will be played in New York (New Jersey) in 2014, and will be the first modern day Super Bowl in cold weather. Now Chicago wants to join in on that and the Mayor spoke to Commissioner Roger Goodell about hosting the game and the NFL draft. The game sites have been selected through 2017, so the first chance Chicago would have is in 2018. However, the draft is only slated to be in New York through 2014, meaning the NFL could move it in 2015., 19247=7/24/14: The Bears have not made the playoffs since 2010, of which Bears fans are painfully aware and tired of watching Green Bay win the NFC North. But things are looking up in the Second City. Second year head coach Marc Trestman has the offense operating at a high level, fortified with two towers for wide receivers in Brandon Marshall and Alshon Jefferies. The Bears have the pieces to make a run at the division, and, to be fair, the NFC North should be among the more interesting divisions in the NFL this season as there are three teams that could legitimately take the title., 64997=1/24/13: Winning 10 games usually means a contract extension, or at least that you will return the following year. But the Bears fired Lovie Smith on December 31, citing lack of progress on offense, despite a 10-6 record (the Bears missed the playoffs again). Throughout the speculation of Lovie's successor, Marc Trestman's name kept popping up. Trestman has not coached in the NFL in quite a while and has spent the last five years coaching the Montreal Alouettes of the CFL. It will be interesting to see how this turns out: Will he be the gateway to future CFL coaches coming to the NFL, or will he flame out like many expect?, 46266=9/19/13: Chicago is showing that they are still a great early season team. If the Super Bowl was awarded in September, then they may be defending that title several times. They made it to 2-0 by beating the Vikings at home 31-30. Jay Cutler threw a late TD to Martellus Bennett for the winning score. It is good to see the Bears spreading the ball around these days. Cutler also had 292 yards in the air, with three touchdowns and two interceptions in the game. Chicago will take their undefeated record on the road for the Sunday Night game in Pittsburgh (0-2)., 27134=4/24/14: When the Bears acquired Brandon Marshall a few years ago, it was the first time in forever that they had a true number one wide receiver. The drafted Alshon Jeffries not too long ago, and have a pretty powerful 1-2 punch. They may also have a third coming up. Marshall is raving about second year receiver Marquess Wilson, a seventh round pick in the 2013 draft. Wilson and Marshall have been working out together, and combined with Jeffries, could be one of the tallest receiving corps ever. The bears also signed veteran Josh Morgan to a one year deal, so it looks like they are intent on throwing the ball this year., 17295=8/7/14: The Bears lost QB Kyle Orton to a waiver claim by Kansas City in 2011. An interesting point is that current Bears General Manager Phil Emery was with Kansas City at the time and is familiar with Orton. Now, Orton may be reuniting with Chicago. He was released by the Dallas Cowboys after missing offseason work. Chicago could be a good opportunity for Orton if he does not want to retire yet. The current backup quarterbacks are Jordon Palmer and Jimmy Clausen and rookie sixth round pick David Fales. Orton would likely step into the number two role right away and give the Bears more security should something happen to Jay Cutler., 63091=2/14/13: The Chicago Bears made the somewhat unexpected move of cutting wide receiver Johnny Knox this week. Knox suffered a severe back injury against the Seahawks in September 2011 and has not played since. He had worked hard to get back into form, but the Bears may have felt that it was taking too long. He was productive when he played and had Jay Cutler's faith. It was hoped that he would be paired with Brandon Marshall, but it looks like that opportunity will go fully to Alshon Jefferies, who showed flashes of brilliance in his rookie season last year. Knox's career may be over, which is a sad fate for a talented player who was well respected by his teammates., 60072=4/11/13: The Bears made a move that QB Jay Cutler has to love. They replace JaMarcus Webb with Jermon Bushrod at left tackle. Webb will compete with Gabe Carimi and Jonathan Scott for the right tackle position. Webb came to national attention last season during a nationally televised game when Cutler was seen berating and hitting Webb on the sideline. To Cutler's defense, he had just been sacked for about the 45th time in the game. Webb played 10 games at right tackle as a rookie in 2010. However, this is probably Carimi's job to lose at this point., 65645=1/17/13: The Saints will send three players to the Pro Bowl in a few weeks: quarterback Drew Breese, left guard Jahri Evans, and punter Thomas Morstead. Evans was among the more consistent players this year for the Saints and is a big reason that New Orleans has one of the best offensive lines in the league. It is his fourth straight Pro-Bowl selection, and marks the first time in franchise history that a player has been selected to three consecutive all-star games. In other news, the team and Sean Payton formalized his extension through 2017, making him the highest paid coach in the game., 57636=5/9/13: Based upon size alone, J'Marcus Webb should be the proto-typical offensive tackle. He weighs in at 333 pounds and measures a gigantic 6'7. He is best known for getting bumped and chewed out by Bears QB Jay Cutler on a Monday Night Game last season after Cutler was sacked for what seemed like the 100th time that night. Webb was arrested in February on drug related charges (later dropped). Webb says that was a wake up call and has gotten sober. He said his off field issues affected his play. The Bears signed Jermon Bushrod, so Bushrod may get the call at left tackle, which would probably move Webb to the right side., 62527=3/7/13: Chicago was one of eight teams to use their franchise tag, and it looks like they made a good investment in tagging young veteran defensive tackle Henry Melton. Had the Bears let Melton walk, he surely would have been picked up in a hurry, possibly by the Dallas Cowboys. Melton had another great season in 2012 with six sacks (third among DT's) and forcing two fumbles. The franchise tag will cost the Bears almost $9 million next season, but gives the team several months to work out a long term contract for a likely annual Pro-Bowler., 56940=5/16/13: It is not often that a celebrated first round pick could be cut after only two years on the job, but such is the case with offensive lineman Gabe Carimi. Carimi was a first round pick of the Bears in 2011. He started two games at right tackle in 2011 before suffering a season ending knee injury. He played last year, though not very well. The Bears drafted Kyle Long to play right guard in this years draft and signed free agent Jermon Bushrod. Carimi will be competing for a roster spot with Edwin Williams, who can play both center and guard. That means there may be a young and talented O-lineman up for grabs in a few months, one that many teams would likely want., 45655=9/26/13: It's been said here before, but the Bears - over the past decade or so - are among the best September teams. They continued that streak with their third win of the season - a 40-23 victory over the winless Pittsburgh Steelers on Monday Night. In a game that looked much better on paper a couple months ago, the Bears defense went wild. They sacked Steelers' QB Ben Roethlisberger six times and scored two touchdowns. That kind of defensive performance can keep the Bears in the hunt all season if it continues. Chicago (3-0) now travels to Detroit (2-1) for a division game on Sunday.}",

Suffice it to say, no one wanted to trade for Cutler, whether it was due to his performance, demeanor, contract or anything else. It is unfortunately, because Cutler is a supremely talented player. He certainly has rubbed many the wrong way and his leadership skills have been called in to question. Regardless, the Bears gave him a monster contract a year ago and no one else wants to take that obligation these days. 3/18/15: Oh, how quickly things can change when a new administration takes over. A year ago, the Chicago Bears gave wide receiver Brandon Marshall a big contract (some of which he graciously donated to mental health research). He had a good season last year until he got injured. Overall, he has played very well in Chicago and has been a model professional. Now the Bears have traded him for a fifth round pick. It seems that the Bears fans are not upset that he was traded, but the low return the team got in return for one of the better wide receivers in the game. 3/11/15: There had been speculation for a while now",
