            "Journal NAILED Magazine NAILED is an arts and culture magazine that features candid writing, essays, art, poetry, fiction, comics, interviews, letters, photography, and more. NAILED was founded on five defining adjectives that we constantly strive to reflect in the content that we publish: artful, passionate, raw, challenging, and intelligent. We publish new content daily, with a focus on relevant, cultural topics and personal struggles. We are interested in unbarred, exposed writing that is not typically found in online zines.",
            "Journal NANO Fiction NANO Fiction accepts submissions of flash fiction of 300 words or fewer.",
            "Journal A NARROW FELLOW A NARROW FELLOW is a journal of poetry. The name of our journal comes from one of Emily Dickinson's poems about a narrow fellow in the grass. We focus on selecting the very best in contemporary poetry from the U.S. and abroad.",

            "Journal Narrative Northeast NN is a literary and arts magazine dedicated to diverse voices and visions, to creating a platform for writers who actually have something to say. With our editorial picks, we\u2019re hoping to help to break down or mitigate the insistent voice of mono-culture. NN is looking for diverse, playful, edgy, socially aware voices, feminist, LBGT, and straight. However, any topic or theme is acceptable for NN, as we see the arts in general as a powerful catalyst for change.",
