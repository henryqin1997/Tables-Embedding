The monster hit Broadway's been desperate for (Michael Riedel, New York Post). The Book of Mormon follows a pair of young mismatched Mormon boys sent on a mission to a place that is as far from Salt Lake City as you can get. There they attempt to share The Book and find it troublesome to connect with the people who care only about their worries of war, poverty, famine, and AIDS. Described by Jon Stewart of The Daily Show as a crowning achievement, so good it makes me angry and by Entertainment Weekly as the funniest musical of all time. See it now or find yourself asking, Dear God, how do I get tickets? Contains explicit language. The Book Of Mormon Tickets Theater Tickets > The Book Of Mormon Home >",
