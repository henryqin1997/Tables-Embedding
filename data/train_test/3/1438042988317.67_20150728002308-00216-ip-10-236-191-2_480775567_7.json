The above description of the present invention has focused on a number of preferred embodiments. It should be understood that a number of other configurations may potentially be employed that embody the principles and concept of the present invention, which is to provide at least one beam between a disc drive slider and the block to which it is mounted, the beams being compliant to permit rotation of the slider with respect to the mounting block while being inclined with heights that extend out of the general plane of the mounting block to resist movements and vibrations in other directions. Active elements such as piezoelectric elements are connected between the movable portion supporting the slider (such as a head suspension) and the head mounting block, and expansion or contraction of the piezoelectric elements results in deformation of the beams. The beams are arranged with respect to each other to establish a virtual pivot point where lines extending from the beams intersect, so that deformation of the beams due to expansion or contraction of the piezoelectric elements causes rotation of the movable portion about the virtual pivot point. The number of beams utilized, the choice of expandable elements, and",
