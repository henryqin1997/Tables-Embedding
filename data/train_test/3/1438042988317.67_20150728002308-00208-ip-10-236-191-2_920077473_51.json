This campus is currently building dorms and dining facilities for 400 students that will be available in the fall of 2013. There are nature trails for walking at the campus and a near by bike path that leads to Lake George., 138762=Eeek. Kidding kidding. There are two dinning halls on campus and one take out place where freshman are allowed unlimited swipes. The food in those dining halls isn't what your mother/ grandmother made but it is edible. Some days the food is better than others. October had been a pretty good month food-wise because we had October fest and Saint John's took over the food one night for a celebration and the food was awesome. One thing I really love is late night. It is awesome when you have a class or lab in my case that ends after 9. With your one late night swipe you can get food at subway or the Sundowner (the best dining hall on campus), 134109=Currently there are no dorms. They will be completed in 2013., 133647=The quality of food has increased over the last few weeks and one of the cafes is currently being renovated for the Fall semester. In 2013 the cafeteria will be renovated as well., 253482=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Time management is key! A big key. Bang for the buck The dormitories and bathrooms within could be in better condition. Then again, it is meant only to be a living space during your stay, so it is mostly meant to be useful. I'm having trouble paying for college, but it was the second most affordable, SUNY Albany being the first since it's 10 minutes away from home. However, it is not a bad deal. Am enjoying being here The atmosphere is pleasant. The campus is pretty small, so it usually does not take me more than 10 minutes AT MOST to get to class. That should be easier during the really cold winter days. I had joined one martial art club, in which the people welcomed me very much, and i had also participated in a few rallies at the school. Am learning a lot However, learning is not just in classroom. I am learning to live on my own. I am also learning that being independent is a lot harder than I thought it would be. Classes are fairly decent, but I feel that most of the time, I have to be teaching myself. The professors",
