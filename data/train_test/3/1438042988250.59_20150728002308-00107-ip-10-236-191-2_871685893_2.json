In 2009, the estimated annual growth rate was 1.1%.[4] The CIA World Factbook gives the world annual birthrate, mortality rate, and growth rate as 1.89%, 0.79%, and 1.096% respectively.[5] The last 100\u00a0years have seen a rapid increase in population due to medical advances and massive increase in agricultural productivity[6] made possible by the Green Revolution.[7][8][9], 17034=According to United Nations population statistics, the world population grew by 30%, or 1.6\u00a0billion people, between 1990 and 2010.[14] In number of people the increase was highest in India (350\u00a0million) and China (196\u00a0million). Population growth was among highest in the United Arab Emirates (315%) and Qatar (271%).[14], 15255=Some countries experience negative population growth, especially in Eastern Europe mainly due to low fertility rates, high death rates and emigration. In Southern Africa, growth is slowing due to the high number of HIV-related deaths. Some Western Europe countries might also encounter negative population growth.[11] Japan's population began decreasing in 2005.[12] The United Nations Population Division expects world population to peak at over 10\u00a0billion at the end of the 21st century but Sanjeev Sanyal has argued that global fertility will fall below replacement rates in the 2020s and that world population will peak below 9\u00a0billion by 2050 followed by a long decline.[13], 13992=The actual annual growth in the number of humans fell from its peak of 88.0\u00a0million in 1989, to a low of 73.9\u00a0million in 2003, after which it rose again to 75.2\u00a0million in 2006. Since then, annual growth has declined. In 2009, the human population increased by 74.6\u00a0million, which is projected to fall steadily to about 41\u00a0million per annum in 2050, at which time the population will have increased to about 9.2\u00a0billion.[4] Each region of the globe has seen great reductions in growth rate in recent decades, though growth rates remain above 2% in some countries of the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, and also in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Latin America.[10], 62231=According to UN's 2010 revision to its population projections, world population will peak at 10.1bn in 2100 compared to 7bn in 2011.[46] A 2014 paper by demographers from several universities and the United Nations Population Division forecast that the world's population will reach about 10.9 billion in 2100 and continue growing thereafter.[47] However, some experts dispute the UN's forecast and have argued that birthrates will fall below replacement rate in the 2020s. According to these forecasters, population growth will be only sustained till the 2040s by rising longevity but will peak below 9bn by 2050.[48]}",
