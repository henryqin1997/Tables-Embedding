            "Washington University is great for students who are seriously committed to academics and willing to work hard to succeed. The atmosphere is generally laidback and there are many opportunities for fun, but \u201cgood grades\u201d will not be handed out free. A strong work ethic and a desire to learn are essential. Additionally, the university consists of a very diverse community, so potential students should be willing to have an open mind about things they may have never been exposed to before.",
            "The admissions process is competitive but by no means impossible. Obviously, things like a strong academic record, high standardized test scores, and an exceptional application essay are important; unfortunately, as with many selective universities, they do not necessarily guarantee acceptance. One way to stand out in a talented group of applicants is to demonstrate an ability to succeed in a college setting. With opportunities like the High School Summer Scholars Program, Washington University offers potential students the chance not only to show that they can handle Washington University coursework but also to earn college credit. While getting involved in the college scene during high school may not assure acceptance, I think it certainly gives students a competitive advantage. Another important point is that Washington University has something of a reputation for placing many applicants on a waitlist. From what I know about it, the number of students\u2014if any\u2014who are accepted off the waitlist varies from year to year, so there is no way to really tell what your chances are. If you are offered the chance to be placed on the waitlist and are still interested in attending Washington University, accept the waitlist position, but make sure you have a backup plan.",
            "Washington University has a reputation for being quite expensive, and it is. The good news, however, is that Student Financial Services is exceptionally helpful, so do not let fiscal concerns keep you from applying. Washington University works very hard to ensure that those who are accepted can attend if they so choose\u2014regardless of their family\u2019s financial situation. If your family is very wealthy, chances are they will have to pay a total of over $200,000, but you will receive a high-quality education from a well-respected university. On the other hand, if you come from a lower or middle-class family, you can receive that same education for a price that is more suited to your family\u2019s circumstances. Granted, you may need to work a part-time job as part of the Federal Work-Study Program, or you may need to look for a few outside scholarships, but overall, Washington University does a good job of making a great education a reality for just about anyone who is accepted.",
            "While the classes are certainly challenging, I love being at Washington University. The community is very close-knit; despite being located in the city of St. Louis, the main campus is a beautiful, park-like oasis, set off from the surrounding metropolis in what is commonly referred to as the \u201cWashU Bubble.\u201d Freshmen and some upperclassmen live together on a forty-acre plot of land known as the \u201cSouth 40,\u201d which is adjacent to the main campus and consists of residential buildings as well as a variety of places to eat, study, relax, and socialize. All facilities that I have seen, both on the South 40 and on the main campus, are very nice and are well maintained. Moreover, the people are generally accepting and friendly, and even though the academics are competitive, students usually try to help each other succeed rather than to cut each other down.",
            "The classes here can be quite demanding; however, in the end, the hard work is worth it. While for the majority of students, long hours of studying are probably necessary to succeed, Washington University assists with the learning process by offering a plethora of academic resources, such as free tutoring and academic mentoring for (almost) any class. In addition, many of the professors have a lot of knowledge to impart, as they are true experts in their field. Of course, some are better than others, but for the most part, the instructors are very knowledgeable about their subjects, and many of them show great enthusiasm for what they do, which I find makes it much easier and more exciting to learn. There is a large array of courses to take, and students, especially freshmen, are encouraged to explore their interests. In fact, at least for Arts and Sciences students, there is only one general education requirement\u2014Writing I\u2014so they have great freedom to discover what their passion is and can continue to learn more about that passion."

Whether it is going out to shop or eat on the Delmar Loop or going to a Rams or Blues game, there is always something to do in St. Louis if you're looking in the right places. Also, there is a great concert and movie scene right near campus. However, for the majority of the time, most people tend to hang out on or around campus with friends., 148824=Ten minutes down the road is Delmar Boulevard, loving known as The Loop. Here are a multitude of restaurants that easily fit the budget of a college student along with a thrift shop, record store, book store, several clothing stores, and a movie theater. Forest Park is also the campus's front yard and is home to events such as Ballon Glow (a hot air ballon festival) and several free attractions such as the Zoo, Art Museum, and History Museum. Also WashU provides metro passes to the students allowing for fun trips to the Mall, downtown to Busch Stadium for a baseball game, or to Central West End for some exploration., 222706=The campus is insanely awesome with sweet dorms. The people are super friendly, and the campus is very safe with a police headquarters right near the dorms. Saint Louis is really great and Delmar Blvd. is only a short distance away from the school., 194416=There are too many options for food on-campus, and the Delmar Loop, a short walk from campus, is replete with dining options and trendy boutiques., 200693=Wash U is located next to Del Mar Loop, one of America's top streets for entertainment and dining., 139660=Within walking distance from school is the Delmar Loop, which has many shops, restaurants, art galleries, and bars in addition to a hotel, a movie theatre, and a 24/7 bowling alley., 252792=Get involved, don't be afraid to jump into things. I know a great hang out place is Del Mar, so there's lots to do around there., 102809=Located fairly close to campus is the Delmar Loop, a street with dozens of restaurants and stores. Most people go looping with their friends at least once every week, and it is very safe and inviting and fun. Other options are all the campus-sponsored events, or going to Forest Park and the free museums and free zoo., 266884=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 254774=I was dragged against my will to this school by my mother, who thought it would be a good fit. Once I got to campus, I loved the atmosphere, the campus was beautiful, and the community seemed both collaborative and competitive. The wait for their decision is long, but hopefully worth it. (I submitted my application in November and will not hear from them until April)}",

Someone that wants a well rounded education would be great here. If you have other passions than just pure academics, Wash U is a great environment to pursue those alongside a rewarding degree. Tips for prospective students Get involved. You will more likely be accepted if the school sees that you are passionate and active. Also, the more you work on managing your time now, the easier it will be once you get to Wash U. Good grades are also very important. Bang for the buck Being a private school, the expenses are higher than most schools. However, I do think the university does a decent job",
