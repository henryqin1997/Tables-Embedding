            "Tough guy to move in the trenches; never gives up on a play.",
            "Did not truly come on until late in the year, but once he did\u2026wow. Haloti Ngata of the NFC.",
            "Incredibly nimble for a 300-pounder. Can rush the passer (eight sacks on the season despite missing time and fighting through a calf injury) and also anchor against the run.",
            "Ate himself out of New York but offers some power whenever one of the starters needs some oxygen.",
            "Skims the edge with astonishing speed. Can change directions and hunt down the ball in the blink of an eye. (OK\u2026in 10 blinks of the eye. But blink 10 times in a row and you\u2019ll realize that\u2019s still incredibly quick.)",
            "Fundamentally sound system player, but not enough of his tackles come near the line of scrimmage. Plus, you don\u2019t draft \u201cfundamentally sound system players\u201d fifth overall.",
            "Green Bay\u2019s most dynamic inside linebacker. Instincts aren\u2019t dazzling, but very good at reacting to what he sees. Gets downhill with alacrity.",
            "Plays because he\u2019s a better athlete than all of the other \u201cnon-injured\u201d outside linebackers.",
            "Can make the play that\u2019s right there in front of him, but that\u2019s about it.",
            "Hard to believe he went undrafted given that he\u2019s such a natural talent. Ball skills have flourished now that he\u2019s comfortable with one-on-one technique.",
            "Matthews is fantastic, but this is still Green Bay\u2019s most valuable defensive player. His versatility is what makes Dom Capers\u2019 defense thrive.",
            "Not bad, but completions seem to occur most often in his area of the field.",
            "Excellent range. Has a knack for sniffing out the ball when in attack mode. Very good tackler, too.",
            "Undrafted rookie has terrific speed. Less than two years of cornerbacking experience explains why he sometimes struggles to feel-out his safety help.",
            "Was looking like the next big thing until injuries derailed much of his 2010 season."

RB Ryan Torain DOES have a hamstring injury and won\u2019t play. Fortunately, Clinton Portis is back after missing five games with a bad groin. Portis may not have RG Artis Hicks (thigh) to run behind, but Hicks is probably on the cusp of losing his starting job anyway. S LaRon Landry (Achilles) and CB Carlos Rogers (hamstring) are questionable. The Titans are still without Kenny Britt (why do you think they signed Moss?) and they\u2019ll play without TE Craig Stevens (knee scope) for the next few weeks. QB Kerry Collins (calf) is doubtful, which means Jeff Fisher avoids having to make a tough call on Vince Young. CB Vincent Fuller did not practice due to a hamstring injury. UPDATE 9:20 p.m. ET:\u00a0Landry and Rogers are both out for the Redskins. For more NFL news, rumors and analysis, follow @cbssportsnfl on Twitter and subscribe to our RSS Feed ., 114016=Seahawks @ Saints Reggie Bush (fibula) is likely back and eager to stick it to his former USC coach. Starting RB Pierre Thomas (ankle) is still out, though. It\u2019s starting to seem unlikely that Thomas will return at all in 2010. TE Jeremy Shockey is out with a rib injury, and FS Darren Sharper won\u2019t play due to a bad hamstring. That\u2019s noteworthy because Sharper\u2019s replacement, rising first-rounder Malcom Jenkins, is questionable with a neck. Rookie CB Patrick Robinson is also questionable (ankle); Sean Payton will make a decision on him just before kickoff. Seahawks QB Matt Hasselbeck has a crack in his non-throwing wrist. He\u2019ll play, but he won\u2019t get to throw to Brandon Stokley (calf) or Golden Tate (ankle).}",

En route, we* managed to figure out not only where they're coming from, but what they'll do for their respective teams in the Super Bowl. Perhaps the most fascinating thing if you look (at a glance anyway) at Pittsburgh and Green Bay is that they've built their teams \"properly.\" (AKA \"the opposite of Dan Snyder.) They draft smart, and they sign smarter. At least that's what we're lead to believe, right?
