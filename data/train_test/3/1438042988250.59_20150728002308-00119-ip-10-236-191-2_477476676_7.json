As explained above, selection of the best good SAM detection can be based on which SAM detection corresponds to one or more actual servo demodulation values that are closest to one or more predicted servo demodulation values., 118780=If the detection of the SAM pattern is characterized as a bad SAM detection (i.e., if the answer to decision 1108 is no), then one or more previously stored (or predicted based on previously stored) channel control values are used as starting values when reading a next servo wedge, as specified at step 1112. By using previously stored (or predicted based on previous stored) channel control values following a SAM detection characterized as a bad SAM detection, garbage values will not be used for servo AGC, PLL, and the like, reducing the likelihood the servo demodulator 404 will lose lock, as explained above., 110770=After one of the SAM detections is selected as a best good SAM detection, further servo functions are performed, taking into account the best good SAM detection characterization, as specified at a step 1020. For example, the servo demodulation values associated with the best good SAM detection can be used for servo control (e.g., used in servo control algorithms). Additionally, where or when to search for the SAM pattern in the following servo wedge can be based on where or when the SAM pattern (characterized as the best good SAM pattern) was just detected.

In still another embodiment, if the two good SAM detections are too closely matched (i.e., one is not much better than the other), then there is not enough confidence to write to and/or read from data fields that follow the servo wedge. However, if one of the good SAM detection is much better (e.g., the SAM detection is associated with actual demodulation values much closer to the predicted values), then data can be written to and/or read from data fields that follow the servo wedge., 33504=This application relates to the following commonly invented and commonly assigned applications, each of which was filed on Apr. 14, 2003: U.S. patent application Ser.

Various embodiments of the present invention, described above, can be used to perform these characterizations. For example, this can be accomplished by comparing one or more actual servo demodulation value(s) to one or more predicted servo demodulation value(s). Alternatively, or additionally, other factors, such as the extent that an actual SAM-to-SAM value (associated with a detected SAM pattern) differs from an EXPECTSAM value, and/or confidence determinations, can be used to characterize each detection of the SAM pattern as a good or a bad SAM detection., 119449=If the detection of the SAM pattern is characterized as a good SAM detection (i.e., if the answer to decision 1108 is yes), then the channel control values determined for a servo wedge are stored, as specified at a step 1110. The just stored one or more channel control values are then used as starting values (or to predict starting values) when reading the next servo wedge, as specified at a step 1114., 68474=In this example, the SAM is detected at times t1 and t2. However, the SAM is not detected at time t3, and eventually the sector timer value equals the ENDSEARCH value. At this time, the timeout condition has occurred and the sector timer 542 loads the value from the TIME SUP load time register (or from memory), which is represented by dashed line 608. This enabled the next SAM to be detected at time t4. For a more specific example, assume the STARTSEARCH value equals 990, the EXPECTSAM value equals 1000, and the ENDSEARCH value equals 1010. The difference between the EXPECTSAM value and the ENDSEARCH value in this example equals 10 (i.e., 1010\u22121000=10), which is the value in the TIMEUP load time register represented by dashed line 608. Once the timeout condition occurs, the sector timer 542 is reset to 10 (instead of zero), enabling the servo field detector 430 to detect the next SAM at time t4., 107447=If the SAM pattern is not detected in the servo wedge (i.e., if the answer to decision 1004 is no), the further servo functions are performed, taking into account no detection of the SAM pattern. This can include, for example, free-wheeling to attempt to detect the SAM pattern in the following servo wedge. This can also include halting reading data from and writing data to data fields that follow the servo wedge. This can further include, using the one or more predicted servo demodulation values for servo control., 84184=Now, assume that an embodiment of the present invention, as described above, is used to characterize the detection of the SAM pattern at time t3-n as a bad SAM detection. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the SAM pattern in the next servo wedge 138 will be searched for based on when/where the previous SAM pattern, that was characterized as a good SAM detection, was detected. In this example the sector timer 542 was already reset to zero, and has begun counting. The searching for the next SAM based on a time/location of a detected SAM pattern, characterized as a good SAM detection, is accomplished by beginning to search for the next SAM pattern at a later time/location. For example, assume that the stored STARTSEARCH value equals 990, the stored EXPECTSAM value equals 1000, and the stored ENDSEARCH value equals 1010. Also assume the SAM pattern characterized as a bad SAM detection was detected when the sector timer value was 992, and that the previous SAM pattern, characterized as a good SAM detection, was detected when the sector timer value was 1000. Thus, the bad SAM detection in this example occurred 8 sector timer counts earlier than the EXPECTSAM value. As just mentioned, one of the embodiments of the present invention, described above, is used to characterize the current SAM detection as a bad SAM. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, to correct for the bad SAM detection, the value in the STARTSEARCH register is temporarily set to equal 998 (i.e., 990+8=998), the value in the EXPECTSAM register is temporarily set to 1008 (i.e., 1000+8=1008), and the value in the TIMESEUP timeout register is temporarily set to 1018 (i.e., 1010+8=1008). If some of these values were stored in memory locations, they can be temporarily changed in memory. More generally, where/when to search for the next SAM is adjusted so that the search for the next SAM is based on the most recently detected good SAM(s), rather than being based on the detection characterized as a bad SAM. In this example, this enables the servo demodulator 404 to perform a good SAM detection at time t4, at which point the STARTSEARCH, EXPECTSAM and ENDSEARCH values are reset or returned to what they were at time t2, and the servo demodulator 404 maintains servo lock. More specifically, when the SAM pattern is detected (e.g., at time t4), and characterized as a good SAM detection, as a result of temporarily adjusting values (e.g., the values in the STARTSEARCH register, the EXPECTSAM register and the ENDSEARCH register, as explained above) these values are returned to their previous values (e.g., by subtracting 8 counts from each value or replacing the values with stored values)., 108725=If no detection of the SAM pattern is characterized as a good SAM detection (i.e., if the answer to decision 1008 is no), then further servo functions are performed, taking into account a bad SAM detection(s) characterization(s), as specified at a step 1016 For example, this can include halting reading data from and writing data to data fields that follow the servo wedge. This can also include, using one or more predicted servo demodulation values for servo control, since the actual servo demodulation values are likely garbage. Additionally, where or when to search for the SAM pattern in the following servo wedge can be appropriately adjusted, as explained in detail above., 118013=If the SAM pattern is detected in the servo wedge (i.e., if the answer to decision 1104 is yes), then the detection is characterized as a good or a bad SAM detection, at a step 1106. Various embodiments for characterizing the detection of the SAM pattern are explained in detail above. For example, this can be accomplished by comparing the actual servo demodulation value(s) to the predicted servo demodulation value(s). Alternatively, or additionally, other factors, such as the extent that an actual SAM-to-SAM value (associated with a detected SAM pattern) differs from an EXPECTSAM value, and/or confidence determinations, can be used to characterize a detection of the SAM pattern as a good or a bad SAM detection., 135385=In the embodiments of the present invention just described above, a pair of servo demodulators 404A and 404B, and a pair of paths 412A and 412B are used to determine which of the two most likely zones the head 414 is actually located. Such embodiments are most useful when the head 414 is near a boundary between two adjacent zones (or more specifically, when a zone bit recorded servo wedge that the head 414 is attempting to read is near the boundary between two adjacent zones). However, there will be occasions where there is high confidence as to which zone the head 414 is located, and thus, that there would be no need to search for a SAM pattern using two different nominal frequencies. For example, when the head 414 is deep within (e.g., near a center of) a zone at a first point in time, it is relatively easy from the microprocessor 410 to have high confidence that the head 414 will still be within the same zone at a second point in time, assuming the difference between times is relatively small. During such occasions, the disk drive device 1302 can use the extra servo demodulator 404B and path 412B for something other than searching for the SAM pattern at the nominal frequency associated with one of the adjacent zones. In other words, embodiments of the present invention make good use of the additional servo demodulation capability for those times when there is high confidence about which zone the head 414 is located. Such embodiments are now discussed below., 109453=If only one detection of the SAM pattern is characterized as a good SAM detection (i.e., if the answer to decision 1010 is no), then further servo function are performed, taking into account the one good SAM detection characterization, as specified at a step 1018. For example, this can include reading data from and writing data to data fields that follow the servo wedge. This can also include, using the one or more actual servo demodulation values for servo control, since the actual servo demodulation values are likely good. Additionally, where or when to search for the SAM pattern in the following servo wedge can be based on where or when the SAM pattern was just detected (e.g., the center of the next SAM search window can be based on the just determined SAM-to-SAM time)., 120914=If the SAM pattern is detected in the servo wedge (i.e., if the answer to decision 1126 is yes), then the detection is characterized as a good or a bad SAM detection at a step 1128. If the detection of the SAM pattern is characterized as a bad SAM detection (i.e., if the answer to decision 1130 is no), then one or more previously stored (or predicted based on previously stored) channel control values are used as starting values when reading a next servo wedge, as specified at a step 1132. If the detection of the SAM pattern is characterized as a good SAM detection (i.e., if the answer to decision 1130 is yes), then the just stored one or more channel control values are used as starting values (or to predict starting values) when reading a next servo wedge, as specified at a step 1134., 93035=Embodiment of the present invention can also be implemented primarily in hardware. As mentioned above, STARTSEARCH, EXPECTSAM, ENDSEARCH and TIMESUP load time values can be stored in registers. When a SAM detection is characterized as a bad SAM detection, the master state machine 532 or microprocessor 410 can write a specified bit (e.g., a zero) to a predetermined register. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, writing the specified bit to the predetermined register will cause the values in the STARTSEARCH and ENDSEARCH registers to be adjusted by an ADJUST value. According to an embodiment of the preset invention, the ADJUST value is equal to the actual SAM-to-SAM value (i.e., the value of the sector timer 542 when the SAM characterized as being bad was detected) minus the stored EXPECTSAM value. Prior to the bad SAM detection, assume the STARTSEARCH value (i.e., the value the in the STARTSEARCH register) is 990, the EXPECTSAM value is 1000, and the ENDSEARCH value is 1010. Also assume, for this example, that the SAM-to-SAM value is 993 when the SAM characterized as being bad is detected (i.e., the value of the sector timer 542 is 993 when the SAM characterized as being bad was detected), thereby causing the ADJUST value to equal \u22127 (i.e., 993\u22121000=\u22127). After the values in the STARTSEARCH and ENDSEARCH registers are adjusted by \u22127, the STARTSEARCH value becomes 997 (i.e., 990\u2212\u22127=997) and the ENDSEARCH value becomes 1017 (i.e., 1010\u2212\u22127=1017). In another example, assume that the SAM-to-SAM value is 1005 when the SAM characterized as being bad is detected. This will cause the ADJUST value to equal 5 (i.e., 1005\u22121000=5). After the values in the STARTSEARCH and ENDSEARCH registers are adjusted by 5, the STARTSEARCH value becomes 985 (i.e., 990\u22125=985) and the ENDSEARCH value becomes 1005 (i.e., 1010\u22125=1005). Such adjustments to the STARTSEARCH and ENDSEARCH registers will assist the servo demodulator 404 with performing a good SAM detection in the next servo wedge 138, even though a bad SAM detection occurred in the current servo wedge 138 ., 89345=Now, assume that an embodiment of the present invention, as described above, is used to characterize the detection of the SAM pattern at time t3-n as a bad SAM detection. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the SAM pattern in the next servo wedge 138 will be searched for based on when/where the previous SAM pattern was detected, which was characterized as a good SAM detection. Since in this example the sector timer 542 was already reset to zero, and has began counting, the searching for the next SAM based on a previous SAM detection (characterized as a good SAM detection) is accomplished by adjusting a timer (e.g., sector timer or delay timer). For example, assume that the stored STARTSEARCH value equals 990, the stored EXPECTSAM value equals 1000, and the stored END SEARCH value equals 1010. Also assume the SAM pattern, characterized as a bad SAM detection was detected when the sector timer value was 992, and that the previous SAM detection (characterized as a good SAM detection) occurred when the sector timer value was 1000. Thus, the bad SAM detection in this example occurred 8 sector timer counts earlier than the EXPECTSAM value (and thus the sector timer was reset 8 counts too early, and is therefore 8 counts greater than it should be). As just mentioned, one of the embodiments of the present invention, described above, is used to characterize the SAM detection at time t3-n as a bad SAM detection. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, to correct for the bad SAM detection, the value of the sector timer is adjusted (in this example, reduced by 8 counts) so that the bad SAM detection does not adversely affect the SAM search window. More generally, where/when to search for the next SAM is adjusted, by adjusting the timer, so that the search for the next SAM is based on the most recently detected SAM(s) that was characterized as a good SAM detection, rather than being based on the bad SAM. In this example, this enables the servo demodulator 404 to perform a good SAM detection at time t4, and the servo demodulator 404 maintains servo lock. In other words, in this example the timer is adjusted so that it is equal to what it would have been had the SAM pattern been detected at time t3 (in which case the timer would have been following dashed line 802).}",
