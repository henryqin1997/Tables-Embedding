What a damned $500 piece of S... program!!!! - That helped - I'm feeling much better now I use to be very carm and having a huge amount of patience - and know that there is a steep learning curve with most RIPs - but this is just TOO much. PS: I've installed the ver. 5.1.3 online update. Afterwards the \"Online Profile Updater\" function stopped working....... absolutely fantastic!! Please help - I've been struggling for 3 days (and nigths) and I've not printed anything useable yet",
