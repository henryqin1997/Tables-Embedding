I've been trying to figure out why Shark (the series, not the character) seems boring so far this season. I love James Woods. The characters are still good. I went back to see if there are different writers or directors this season, but they seem the same (rotating). Everything seems expected, and heavy handed, and the dialog isn't interesting. It\u00a0seems forced. I still can't get over why the prosecutors are running around investigating the case, but that didn't bother me last season because the rest of the show was so good. I'll give it a couple of more episodes, but something seems missing from last year.moreless pgrigg, Nov 26, 2007 By 3.5 This season isn't as good as last season. Permalink Twitter Facebook",
