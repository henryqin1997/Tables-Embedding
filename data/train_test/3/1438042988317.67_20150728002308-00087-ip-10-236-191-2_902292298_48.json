            "Relatively safe. Because it's Hawaii, there's nothing really crazy.",
            "Non-existent.",
            "They have a lot of clubs and activities available. I am personally not involved.",
            "If you are rolling in money to the point where you won't have to eat the food or stay in the dorms, then this is the school for you. Also their marine science, nursing, and business programs are impeccable. If those aren't your major, though, it's not a fair trade off.",
            "Due to lack of information for freshmen students, I am unaware of any traditions or unusual locations on campus.",
            "I think in a few years when our tuition stops going toward new additions onto the school, then students will get the bang for the buck. For now you are funding expansion of the school and poorly planned student activities. I would prefer them to invest all the money into AC for the dorms and better food, but that's just me.",
            "They have a 24 hour gym on the Loa campus, it's very small but serves its purpose. There's also a student center where you are treated like a child while you try to watch tv or play pool. It's Hawaii though, you can go to the beach whenever you want! shopping ice skating hiking tanning surfing paddle boarding kayaking sky diving You name it, Hawaii has it. Except Olive Garden or Sonic...or Red Robin...or a lot of other food places.",
            "Breakfast is good at the dining commons. Everything else is questionable. I have literally found myself puking my brains out after dinner because it was so horrible. Stay away from meat and dairy products. And before you eat the dinner, ask what was served for lunch. Most of the time, breakfast items aren't even cooked all the way. Overall, it is some of the worst food I have ever had. On the bright side I didn't gain the freshman fifteen.",
            "I only put one star because it wouldn't let me put zero. Do not utilize the Hawaii Loa dorms. In theory it seems like a good idea, but it's not. Your belongings WILL get moldy, your roommates WILL be poorly matched, and the food WILL make you vomit. The dorms have pretty much ruined my entire first year of college and I would not wish that upon anyone else.",
            "It honestly depends on your professor. Having only gone to this university, I can only base my response off of what I have heard. Our school is often compared to a high school: professors take attendance, you have mini homework assignments, and you get extra credit opportunities and second chances. The work is challenging enough, but they throw in so many extra helpers that it is basically impossible to fail.",
            "Don't dorm If you do, bring febreeze Also don't get a triple occupancy room (same size as double, but with more people) Get used to homeless people Plan a strict budget Befriend your professors FINANCIAL AID",
            "Hawaii Pacific University makes a huge effort to constantly improving their campus and student activities, but it isn't working. They suck all the money they can out of you in order to work on construction projects and it starts to feel like they actually don't have your best interests in mind. If you don't mind spending thousands of dollars that you will never receive a benefit from, then go ahead and apply."

But please, please, please, don't give in to your feelings of wanting to go home. They pass, I promise. I'm 6,000 miles from home. Believe me when I say that I was homesick but I came home for summer and could not wait to return. You will too., 259786=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 7592=Although this is just my first semester and third month at Hawaii Pacific University, I must admit that it has been, so far, the greatest three months of learning I have ever received since grade school. I am currently taking five courses: COM 1200, WRI 1100, CSCI 1011, ARTS 1000, and MATH 1105. The instructors I have are profoundly passionate about what they teach. Furthermore, HPU instructors remarkably do their best to help when students are in need of assistance. Students are free to let the instructor know whether or not the pacing of the lecture is too quick, too slow, or just right. When students are stressing before a test, HPU instructors carefully explain to the students what to know and review what will be on the test. In COM 1200, I have learned that mid-terms, finals, and other tests are a \u201ccelebration of knowledge.\u201d With that in mind, I became more excited to learn about new concepts, new lessons, and further my knowledge than simply skim at through the surface of new ideas. One of the most important things that I have learned in all my classes is the importance of understanding. I realized how each of my professors has taken into account that not all students are at the same level of understanding. Therefore, each professor would ensure that they are teaching at the level to which all students are able to understand what is going on in the class. Especially since there are foreign exchange students, I condemn my instructors for clearly explaining the syllabus and what is expected to earn an A for their class. HPU professors really take the time to ensure that students receive the full education and learning they paid for., 147622=Current dorm life is less appealing than one would wish for a school in Hawaii. The dorms are located on the Windward side of the island where it is more isolated and rainy. It is not east to get anywhere from here, so most students opt to live in apartment buildings near the downtown campus. However, HPU has recently acquired Aloha Tower, and iconic center right on the water near the downtown campus. The university plans to build dorms there for students to live. These dorms are expected to open by 2016. Aloha Tower would be a prime location for student life., 51913=hpu is quite expensive but the experience here is priceless. for example during my final exam in my mars 1020 class on the boat, we all stopped the exam to follow a group of manta rays and green sea turtles. what other school can offer that?, 245876=If you don't get into the actual dorms at the Hawaii Loa campus you end up living in basically a motel in Wailkiki. I've heard rumors of a new dorm location in 2015, they are converting an old shopping center called Aloha Tower. Walking distance from the downtown campus! Don't count on it being available until it's officially announced however, things here are often on Hawaiian Time.}",
