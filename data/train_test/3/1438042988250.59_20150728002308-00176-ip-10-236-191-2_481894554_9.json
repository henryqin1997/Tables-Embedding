    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{33911=An important aspect of the invention is the available temperature range over which the invention may be used. For example, if nickel is used for the cell anode, the catalyzing ability of nickel is operative down to temperatures in the range of 200\ufffd K. See Bond, G. C. Catalysis by Metals. London, N.Y., Academic Press, 1962. Those skilled in the electrolytic cell art understand that the cathode may be cooled to some extent by means of hot electrons transferred to H3 O+ ions, and the cathode is heated due to recombination of H1 atoms into hydrogen gas., 48502=Contrary to the well known Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of molecular energy in gases that arises from the elementary kinetic theory of gases, distribution of electron energy states in metals is best determined using quantum statistics and can be described by a Fermi-Dirac distribution function that defines the relative number of electrons with energy between W and W+dW (per unit volume). See, e.g., Kittel, C. Introduction to Solid State Physics, New York, Wiley & Sons; Ziman, J. Electrons and Phonons, Oxford Press, 1960. Two plots, generally delineated by 100, of Fermi-Dirac distribution functions are seen in FIG. 2. Equation 4 generally describes the Fermi-Dirac distribution as a function of temperature, 26564=This application is a CONTINUATION-IN-PART of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/242,572 filed May 13, 1994, and entitled APPARATUS AND METHODS FOR A MULTIPLE-ENERGY SOURCE THERMAL PUMP, the disclosure of which is specifically incorporated herein., 67235=The electrolytic cell of this instant invention may also be used as a heat pump. For dissociation of water into hydrogen and oxygen gas, a normal electrolytic cell generally consists of two metal electrodes immersed in an electrolyte. Oxygen is released at the cell anode and hydrogen is released at the cell cathode. The dissociation reaction is generally endothermic (heat is consumed) and any recombination is exothermic (heat is released). Such information is well known in the electrolytic cell art and is described in Eisenberg, D. et al. Physical Chemistry with Applications to Life Sciences, John Wiley, 1979. While these effects are known in the art, use of such effects in the design of a heat pump has generally eluded incorporation into an operating heat pump device., 46866=In order to transfer an electron from cathode 30 to a constituent of electrolyte 50, one must expend energy corresponding to the relative electron work functions of the cathode 30 material and electrolyte 50. The electron work functions for polycrystalline and single crystal metals are published in several works. See, e.g., Fomenko V. S. Emission Properties of Materials, 3rd ed., Naukova Dumka, Kiev, 1970; Riviere J. C. et al. Solid State Surface, Vol. 1, 1969, Chap. 4. Electron work functions vary in the range of 1.5-5.8 eV for major metals. Examples are provided in the following table:, 73656=Anode 20' was made of a 0.2 mm thick, 100 mm wide 316 stainless steel band cut long enough to at least circle the inner circumference of beaker 352. Inner surface 400 of anode 20' was coated with a layer of platinum to a thickness of about 1000 \u212b. Anode 20' was disposed in close proximity to the inside surface of beaker 352 with the platinum coated surface 400 disposed toward the interior of the cell., 63588=3. Other ways to improve the catalytic ability of the electrodes include excitation of those surface plasmons responsible for chemical bonds by imposing a high frequency electromagnetic agitation signal upon the electrode. Rowe, J. E. et al. Physical Review Letters, vol. 31, no. 2, (July 1973), p. 102., 75014=It was noted that the electrode height was approximately 20 times the interelectrode gap. The relation between areas of anode 20' and cathode 30' was about 1.1:1.0, respectively. Such geometry suggests mostly radial heat flow in cell 310.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes The invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. The present embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description, and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are, therefore, intended to be embraced therein. The water level in cell 902 is maintained at an operational level by adding water from source 916 regulated by regulator 918. Heat exchanger 902 is used to absorb and transport thermal energy from the space physically and thermally isolated from the space being heated. For example, if system 900 was heating a building, heat exchanger 920 may draw heat from the environment outside the building. In this embodiment, two sources for thermal heating are used. Electrolytic cell 902 generates both combustible gases (hydrogen and oxygen) and high temperature water in the vicinity of the cell cathode. The sum of the thermal energy derived from gas combustion in combustor 904 and from heat exchange through external radiator 908 is greater than the power received from main 910. In other words, the power supplied from the main power source 910 through power supply 912 and square wave generator 914 is coupled with the energy received by cell 902 from heat exchanger 920 to",
