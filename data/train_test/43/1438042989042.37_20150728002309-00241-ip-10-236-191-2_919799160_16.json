            "Strong in academics, willing to give new things a try, good for shy people as it is a smaller college. Really just about everyone in all the social groups could find somewhere to fit in at Cornell.",
            "Go and visit Cornell and ask questions. See if there different and fun way of doing things is right for you.",
            "Cornell offers you a great experience and you get what you pay for the extra cost seems to be well made up for with all the opportunities Cornell gives you.",
            "The campus is great! I was told when visiting you can make friends fast because of the wide variety of students that attend! plus the location of Cornell is near to bigger cities so your never far away from some place that you could go and have fun if you needed a quick break.",
            "The teachers are truly focused on TEACHING nothing else there different schedule at Cornell allows them more one-on-one teaching time."

According to the timeline, everything is supposed to be finished by the end of the fall semester of 2013, however, gauging from the lack of progress made in the past couple of years, construction will not be finished until 2015. Learn how to study. The block plan is stressful, and if you don't know how to manage your time, you will not succeed., 81164=They have a really nice bonfire and fireworks display during football homecoming. It is better than the July 4th display in my city., 84227=It is a small campus with about 2000 students which makes it more personal than larger universities. The blocks are 3 1/2 weeks which is a great deal of material in a short amount of time. Overall, I like the school and what they have to offer., 26881=This was the first year (2012-2013) for a new catering company called Bon Appetit. The caterer used in the past, Sodexo, was horrible. Remember that when you're reading old reviews! The new system is delicious! They have a great selection that is constantly changing. They even have a vegetarian and vegan area. Everyday there is a main serving area with pastas, meat, vegetables dishes and even an in house carvery. But there are also global food, sandwich and salad stations in the cafeteria. Oh, and the desserts are to DIE for., 82473=They are getting a new vendor this year(2012-2013) so I don't know how to rate the food. The current vendor isn't bad but when you eat each and every meal at the dining hall it can be boring after a while., 140625=Food in the Thomas Commons, the only place for dining, is alright. By the end of 2013 calendar year, the Commons will have been fully renovated, offering more opportunities at good food. And the firm that does the cooking, Bon Appetit, is pretty good at what they do., 150563=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

It's really good for people who come from a close knit-community because you definitely feel it on the campus. This college is great for people who want to do a ton of things! There are literally groups for EVERYTHING, from Capoiera to Chess and Games and the Knitting Club! N3rds will have super epic fun here too! Tips for prospective students Make really good friends with your admissions counselor! He or she can be your best friend when applying and visiting Cornell, or any school. If your school offers a facebook group for prospective students, MAKE sure to join and participate, that way you'll already have friends and maybe even a roommate before you arrive in the fall!
