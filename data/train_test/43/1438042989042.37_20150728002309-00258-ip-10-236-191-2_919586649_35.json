I will attend CSU-Pueblo in the fall of 2014., 155637=I lived in the dorm the summer of 2011 and it was really fun to get to meet new people you might have the same classes with but since my parents lived here I decided not to live there anymore because it was too expensive., 295022=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 274843=A new tradition is the 33 things to do before you graduate list. It is a campus wide list based on open student ideas and then a survey to choose the top 33 thins to be put on the Bucket List; 33 was the chosen number because CSU - Pueblo was established in 1933. A location would definitely be the spirit rock which is actually miles from the actual campus is the prairie behind the school., 106324=The food is really expensive. Last semester is was a $1.79 for bottle of water. You can get a bottle of water for $1-1.25 most places. $5 at one of the carts or dining places on campus is typically just enough to get you a container of fruit and maybe a drink. Coffee typically is at least $3. Compared to outside sources of food, I give this a low rating., 170217=The diverse campus at CSU-Pueblo is what makes this school unique. I am a recent veteran and they have been extremely helpful, so military friendly indeed. The cost is something that I can afford near-by school were in excess of 10,000 to live on campus per semester vs CSU-Pueblo at 2960., 131849=Our band is very entertaining, our football team made it to the NCAA D-2 championships during the 2011 season, the drama and art department is also excellent and well known throughout our town., 70596=Food isn't that great and a little expensive but the kitchen is being renovated so it should improve by 2013.}",
