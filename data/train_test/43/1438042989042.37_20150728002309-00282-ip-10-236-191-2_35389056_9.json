So there are no winners here this week. Deepest apologies to trophy-seeking bloggers. Swing is the total change in each ballot from last week to this week (obviously voters who didn't submit a ballot last week are not included). A high number means you are easily distracted by shiny things. A low number means that you're damn sure you're right no matter what reality says.

Texas Tech retains its grip on the top spot and Alabama has to deal with a hard-charging Florida, which used its domination of the OBC to spring past Texas. (An assist to God on that one.) Cincinnati gets the biggest boost and North Carolina takes the most precipitous fall, but like most of college football's punditry, the BlogPoll treats last week as an annoying seven day period to wait before getting to this week. Wack Ballot Watchdog The weirdest thing this week is that \"6\" by Florida up there, right? I wonder if anyone went to the trouble of justifying that beyond \"holy pants that's a lot of points against South Carolina.\" No, no, no\u2026 yes!
