When the user answers 1140, they authenticate 1142 if necessary. If it is not necessary to authenticate, the user can press any key to indicate that the system has reached a person and not an answering machine or voice mail. The user can then listen to the content message 1144 (with the appropriate content player commands) and choose from the menu choices 1146, if offered. If the menu choices permit, the user may choose to be transferred to a different number. Hanging up 1148 terminates the session.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{263604=The device management service 2402 is implemented either with the device placing a call to the telephony platform, or with the telephony platform placing a call to the device. In the former implementation, the automatic number identification (ANI) feature of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) is used for primary verification. The WAP site uses a wireless telephony application interface (WTAI) function to assist the user in placing a call to the telephony platform. The telephony platform sends a message to the WAP site indicating the ANI of the caller. In the latter implementation, the WAP site provides the user with a code. The site then sends a message to the telephony platform directing it to place a call to the mTN claimed by the user. If the user answers the call, they are directed to provide the code. The telephony platform then sends a message to the WAP site with the provided code., 279955=It is also possible to integrate the password management service 2802 with message or email alerts to enable an end user to be alerted when repeated attempts are made to access their account. These alerts occur in real time and require an appropriate response (e.g., a full length password) within a set amount of time or the SubNo.ID is automatically deactivated. The actionable alert also has the option to immediately lock a device that is attempting to gain entry., 255573=The cookie management service 2202 provides enhanced security, in part because the cookie management service intercepts cookies which will be sent to the client destination side rather than caching cookies. The cookie management service allows the user to have only session cookies, which provides additional security, privacy control and convenience to the user. The user can operate within a session as if the cookies are stored, but as soon as the session is timed out, cookies will not be in (or will be removed from) the database., 278866=The password management service 2802 provides a security method that makes it easy for employees to use their own passwords in an easier form for input using a wireless device. Security is maintained by using information about the device that is attempting to access the corporate application. In a sense, the wireless device acts as a physical key that, when combined with a simplified password, allows secure access in much the same way as a bankcard and a personal identification number (PIN)., 260411=In one embodiment, when messages are sent to a telephone number belonging to a wireless device 2406, the web identifier to which the message should go is already known. When the user registers for a data session in the wireless device 2406, they enter their telephone number and a page is returned to that device just as in a normal data sessions action. This is in contrast to the traditional method of sending an alert message, including a code, to the calling device. There is a telephone number in the return pages part of the link. The user clicks that link to make a telephone call into the system. When the telephone call is made, the caller identification (ID) is captured and mapped to the user's telephone number. If the number matches what the user entered, an association is made between the telephone number and the device ID from the device or from the registration service., 111866=Customer applications 602 initiate XML-based content trigger via the integration interface 620 to a DVT-VoiceXML application engine 610. The DVT-VoiceXML application engine 610 uses the audio content manager and transcoder to parse the XML content dialog file. Based on the parsing, a voice menu is constructed using the dynamic grammar generation module. The DVT-VoiceXML application engine 610 then generates a VoiceXML document and stores it in a local storage for expected callers. When an expected caller dials into the system (from a manual dial or from a data session), the domain personalization/manager recognizes the DNIS/ANI associated with the call and retrieves an appropriate VoiceXML document waiting for the caller. The DVT-VoiceXML application engine 610 sends the VoiceXML document to the VoiceXML gateway 608 that executes the document controlling the voice session dialog. When the caller enters a response via voice or DTMF, the DVT-VoiceXML application engine 610 activates the instant messaging and notification hierarchy module and sends the user response to a back-end application. During the voice session, the DVT-VoiceXML application engine 610 can activate the HTTP directory client to provide directory service if needed., 239631=The single sign-on service greatly reduces the involvement of the user in signing on to individual customer applications. The single sign-on service 1710 does not impose a single authentication scheme on all participating applications. It accommodates diverse application security requirements concurrently within a single deployment environment., 283603=The fax service 2900 is based upon the WAP standards. The fax service 2900 consists of a set of software and hardware modules that allow the users of WAP-enabled mobile devices to request that a fax be sent while engaged in a WAP data session. The fax service 2900 converts a web document into image files of TIFF format and then faxes the image files using a built-in fax server or sends the image files as email attachments to an external fax server/service via a simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) interface. If a default fax number has been pre-defined and is accessible from the user's profile data (known as \u201cthe cookie), the user may employ a one-click-to-fax method for sending the fax. Otherwise, the user may specify any G3-based fax number or select it from a telephone book entry. The fax service 2900 can be used in conjunction with other applications or services described herein, such as the single sign-on service. The fax service 2900 can also be effectively used as a stand-alone application that is part of a larger WAP-based platform., 267154=The messaging service 2502 is an action-oriented wireless alert management service that supports unlimited levels of escalation. It is used to manage the wireless delivery of alerts and responses to alerts, as well as the escalation process. The messaging service 2502 does not generate alerts. The generation of alerts is done by any higher level application that uses the messaging service 2502 as a subrate system. Examples of such applications include stock alerts, calendar alerts, etc. The messaging service 2502 provides the wireless network interfaces required to deliver alerts via SMS, WAP, IVR etc. The messaging service 2502 supports guaranteed and scheduled delivery, email support, broadcasting, multicasting with acknowledgement, and an unlimited escalation process. Each alert can be acknowledged via an acknowledge URL registered by the application. Multicasting allows the response URL and acknowledgement URL to track whether each user in the multicasting list (e.g. in a marketing survey or poll) has received and/or responded to the message. Time-based actions are invoked in the event that the intended recipient of an alert does not respond to it. These time-based actions are URL driven and can provide additional network-based requests. The network-based requests can, in turn, interface with the messaging service 2502, causing unlimited escalation. For example, if there is no response to a WAP message within two minutes, the message is resent to SMS, email, and pager., 291765=In one embodiment, the fax service operates on a Windows 2000 Professional\u2122 system with the GammaLink\u2122 fax system from Dialogic\u2122. The third party software required includes Dialogic\u2122 software \u201cSystem Release v5.01\u201d with SDK option, and Blackice\u2122 Monochrome Printer Driver for NT 4.0 and Win2000., 196786=One embodiment of the outcall service supports a T-1 line based Dialogic\u2122 digital telephony platform with a single T-1 interface card (D240). With a T-1 line, the outcall service can support 1380 outgoing one-minute calls per busy hour, at 100% capacity. To handle failover, the outcall service keeps the XML files sent by the customer application. In a worst-case scenario, the end user could receive more calls than the ensure completion value indicates. However, this case is expected to be extremely rare and the consequences acceptable. The outcall service allows multiple active IVR hosts to be provisioned, therefore, if one IVR host is down, another can complete the calls. A switch to a new IVR can be manual or automatic., 75241=This application claims priority from the following U.S. Provisional Patent Applications: Ser. No. 60/226,255, entitled Method and Apparatus for Integrated Data Management, filed Aug. 17, 2000; Ser. No. 60/226,363, entitled Method and Apparatus for Integrated Data Management, filed Aug. 18, 2000; Ser. No. 60/226,855, entitled Method and Apparatus for Integrated Data Management, filed Aug. 22, 2000; Ser. No. 60/242,730, entitled Wireless Location Proxy, filed Oct. 23, 2000; Ser. No. 60/253,978, entitled Wireless Device Registration, filed Nov. 29, 2000; and Ser. No. 60/261,572 entitled Smart Wireless Applications, filed Jan. 12, 2001, all of which are incorporated herein by reference., 228124=According to one embodiment, a voice call number is provided to the WAP/HDTP user. This number is called using the WAP/HDTP wireless device 1406. The homepage provisioning service 1402 receives the call, extracts the caller ID (e.g., telephone number), and terminates the call. The homepage provisioning service uses the caller ID of the wireless device 1406 to find a corresponding homepage URL. In one embodiment, the homepage provisioning table 1410 is queried for the corresponding URL. The homepage URL is sent to the homepage provisioning service 1402, and forwarded to the messaging service 1404. The messaging service sends an actionable alert with an embedded URL for that user's homepage to the user's wireless device 1406. By responding to the alert, the user immediately enters a data session directly with their homepage. The user can bookmark the homepage for later use. The end-user interface 1408 is used to manage the display of homepage entries., 274474=In one embodiment, the prefill service 2710 is a service added to existing applications without affecting the user interface design of the existing application. The user is presented with multiple input selections to choose from. The user selections are placed in a separate \u201cdeck\u201d to avoid any deck size limitation. Companion web site inputs can be used to populate the input fields in a WAP site., 244131=The single sign-on services 1710, 1810, and 1910 provide requested services to the customer application during the process of application sign-on. The customer application may request the SSO password of a user (in the case of the mid-level security model), or store a security token for a user (in the case of the high-level security model). The single sign-on services include servlets with a predefined request and response data stream format. Each customer application requiring any of these services is assigned an application ID. Single sign-on services implement an authorization scheme based on the application ID, and validate each service request using this authorization scheme., 308100=The directory service 3102 can be used, for example, to enable Fortune 1000 companies to provide unique WAP-based directory access to their corporate directories. The directory service 3102 provides visual access to server-side directories on both WAP-enabled terminals and non-WAP terminals. These directories can contain corporate entries, personal entries, or white pages. The entries can be telephone numbers, FAX numbers, and/or email addresses. The directory service 3102 entries can be managed (add/delete/change) either from the desktop PC 3118, or from the WAP enabled wireless device 3106. To secure these entries, access to the WAP directory can be protected by pass code. Further the WAP directory service enables services like call service, instant messaging, follow-me applications, and collaborative services like chat and conferencing., 236157=The interaction of location services 1612 with the services and entities shown allows various functions to be provided transparently. For example, the following functions are performed: auditing, including measuring use (in peg counts) in categories based upon subscriber, application, network, etc., for purposes such as billing, feature customization, usage tracking, etc; managing position data formats; and storing the last known location (for example, for retrieval after temporary loss of GPS coverage, which avoids GPS warm-up delay)., 279402=In addition, maintaining passwords is a critical requirement for highly secure businesses. Many corporations require that passwords be changed on a regular basis. Using a PIN code that is based on a password makes the PIN code easy to remember. Even if passwords change frequently, this method does not impose any additional difficulty for the end user to remember additional passwords. The password management service 2802 allows an entire class of corporate applications to be accessed securely and efficiently., 281133=In one embodiment, the password management service 2802 is an enhanced application of the single sign-on service previously described. It is an additional service that is specifically developed to assist employees of corporations that have stringent security requirements. The password management service 2802 requires integration with the password database that is currently being used by a corporation., 262712=In one embodiment, the device management service 2402 includes a set of methods which use a voice channel telephone call to verify the mobile telephone number (mTN) associated with a device's SubnoID, or with the cookie, or with state variables generated from the registration service. After a device's SubnoID has been collected by a WAP site and the user has claimed a mTN, the wireless application protocol (WAP) site facilitates the connection of a voice call between that device and a voice extensible markup language (VoiceXML) or proprietary telephony platform. This connection provides primary verification of the claimed mTN. The WAP site waits a predetermined amount of time to receive the verification from the telephony platform. To improve scalability and security, secondary verification in the form of a shared code can also be provided., 268726=The messaging service 2502 separates alert management and delivery from alert generation with an open XML over HTTP interface. This allows remote alert management as well as the support of multiple applications from multiple domains on the same messaging service 2502 platform. The messaging service 2502 is augmented with carrier network knowledge, such as which telephone number belongs to which carrier using which WAP identifier, which WAP push gateway is used to push WAP alerts, and which a short message service center (SMSC) is used to receive SMS messages. This allows applications to concentrate on delivering alerts to telephone numbers without having to handle network issues, such as choosing a network to send messages to., 133792=Windows 2000, Service pack 2;, 270937=Previous tools usually focus on transforming one data format into another data format. The transformation process is often guided by internal style-sheets that are built into the process. In contrast, the template generator 2602 takes the source data format and the destination format as input and produces the style-sheets externally. The external style-sheet approach allows modularization between the tool and the presentation service. Any change of wireless device (e.g. new telephone size or new telephone UI) or display format (e.g. WML 2.0 or XHTML) will not affect the presentation service, but only the style-sheet generator. To use the template generator 2602 in one embodiment, the user selects a display type, such as PALM\u2122 or NOKIA\u2122, and a form type, such as \u201clist\u201d. The user may view a simulated screen to determine whether the style-sheet is satisfactory., 135619=Performance approximations for a T1 line are as follows: the incall agent can support 691 one-minute incoming calls per busy hour with a blocking factor of 0.001; 868 calls with a blocking factor of 0.010; 1000 calls with a blocking factor of 0.030; or 1244 calls with a blocking factor of 0.1. Where blocking factor is a measure of switch efficiency., 259778=The user communicates with the navigation service 2408, which communicates with the device management service 2402. The device management service 2402 includes a device entry database, and a user entry database. An entry in the device entry database is accessed for the calling device 2406, or if there is no entry one is created using a login and password. The device management service 2402 communicates with other services, such as the session management service 2410, the cookie management service 2412, and the single sign-on service 2414.}",
