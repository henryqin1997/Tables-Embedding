            "Woulda\u2019, coulda\u2019, shoulda\u2019. Johnson led 182 of 267 laps and finished ninth. He can\u2019t do that in the Chase if he wants his six-pack. Team: Home | Stats | News | Gear",
            "Not a great race for Harvick, but 10th wasn\u2019t bad. He was never a contender, though. Team: Home | Stats | News | Gear",
            "Although he\u2019s still looking for his first race victory of the season, Bowyer made the most of the afternoon by finishing third. Team: Home | Stats | News | Gear",

            "A nice rebound from an early spin saw the younger of the Busch brothers finish in fifth place. Team: Home | Stats | News | Gear",
