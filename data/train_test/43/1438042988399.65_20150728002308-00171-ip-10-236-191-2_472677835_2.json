Ricciardo, who was stripped of a maiden podium in Australia, battled with Red Bull team-mate Sebastian Vettel in China before narrowly missing out on eclipsing Ferrari's Fernando Alonso for third. \"I started on the dirty side of the grid and had quite a poor getaway; I was spinning up on the line a bit too long and lost the two places,\" he said. \"From then on however, I thought the race was good! With Seb, we were racing and you always want to hold on to your position, but the team radioed and he let me through. I did what I could after each stop and we improved the car; at the end I was doing all I could to catch Alonso and I think we got to within a couple of seconds of him as we went over the line. \"It's going well with the team, I feel comfortable here and I did the best I could today. I really want that podium and we're getting close.\" Vettel came home in fifth and revealed that after initially informing his team that it was 'tough luck' that Ricciardo was behind him, he decided to let his team-mate through. \"I moved over for Daniel once I knew that we were on different strategies,\" he said. \"When I was first asked, I didn't understand as we were on the same tyre, unlike in Bahrain, so I double checked. When the team said we were on a different strategy, I moved over and then, as the race went on, I saw more and more that I didn't have the pace. There was no point in holding Dan back. \"I'm not yet where I want to be with the car, but it's an on-going process; hopefully at the next few races we will make some more steps in the right direction. Our weakness isn't in the corners, but on the straights. The first stint today was okay but after that I'm not sure what happened.\", 50311=GPUpdate.net, the daily motorsport news website which is celebrating over a decade of the latest in Formula 1, publicly dates back to 1998.
