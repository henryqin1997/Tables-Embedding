However, 18\u201940' is still a gap that does not allow the leader to relax, just like the 30\u201932' that separates the Dutchman from Ayrat Mardeev or the 38\u201931' between the race leader and Martin Kolomy. It is from fifth place held by Andrey Karginov that the differential with the leader exceeds the one hour mark: 1:22\u201932' for the Russian and 1:56\u201910' for Czech driver Ales Loprais. The gap is even above two hours for seventh placed Pieter Versluis who is battling with his for position with his team-mate (Man) Marcel Van Vliet., 10538=The day seems to be smiling on Chilean riders: Ignacio Casale is leading a stage for the first time on the Dakar 2013 in the quad category, ahead of Marcos Patronelli. Currently fighting for third place are Sarel Van Biljon and Sebastian Husseini, with the South African slightly ahead of the Emirati., 5239=The Dutchman probably did not spare his truck to reel in his opponents on the last part of the route, because in the first half, it was dominated by the Kamaz, Man and Tatra trucks. Andrey Karginov finsished in second, 34' behind De Rooy, only one second ahead of Pieter Versluis, such was the intensity of the battle. In fourth place, Ales Loprais came in 1\u201945' after the stage winner. The gaps were bigger thereafter: 5\u201955' for fifth placed Miki Biasion, and 7\u201913' for sixth placed Martin Kolomy. Having led throughout the first section of the special stage, Eduard Nikolaev finished 13\u201907' behind the day\u2019s winner., 3875=Twenty one seconds separate the Russian Kamaz driver and the Czech Tatra driver who occupy the first two positions on the truck special stage. In third place lies the Man truck driven by Pieter Versluis, 1\u201944' behind the leader, but in front of Gerard De Rooy\u2019s Iveco (4\u201903' behind Nikolaev), the Kamaz belonging to Andrei Karginov (5\u201928' behind the Russian) and the Iveco of Italy\u2019s Miki Biasion (+5\u201947' behind the stage leader).}",
