Here's the content I'm proposing - I'd add it myself if the page weren't protected: Conservative 13:02, 24 July 2012 (EDT) I will fix it later this week. Thanks. Jzyehoshua 12:33, 24 July 2012 (EDT) The percentage of support for Young Earth Creationism has actually gone up 2 points since 1982 when the question was first asked. 2/3 of Americans believing it's true is much higher than most people realize.
