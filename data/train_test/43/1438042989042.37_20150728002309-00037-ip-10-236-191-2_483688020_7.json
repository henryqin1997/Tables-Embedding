    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Having described the invention in connection with certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood that many modifications and variations thereto are possible, all of which fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. As described herein, the voice storage system of the present invention may be incorporated in various communication systems such as two-way radio, telephone, intercom, mobile telephones and the like. The voice storage system of the present invention will find application in medical recording, industrial monitoring, as a voice scratchpad and the like, in addition to paging systems. The system of the present invention is readily incorporated in various receivers and transmitters/receivers at the time of manufacture or may be incorporated in already existing conventional receivers and transmitters/ receivers as an add-on item. The system of the present invention has low power requirements and thus is particularly well suited for use in paging systems where the remote receiver must be small and light, and, of necessity, has a limited power supply. It should be fully understood that while the present system is fully adapted for use with current analog cellular telephone systems, the same steps of monitoring message paths, memory management and subscriber security may also be performed using digital signalling techniques. Manual record functions are provided for recording messages dictated by a user or messages from a caller received at the cellular phone and for recording pre-stored outgoing messages. Manual",
