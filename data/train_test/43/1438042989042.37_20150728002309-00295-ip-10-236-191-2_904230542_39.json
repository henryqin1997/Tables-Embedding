            "I live around South Bend, so I know that there are some awesome shopping malls and stores around the area. There are also plenty of parks and the St. Jo river runs right past campus. The movie theatre is always one of my favorites and it is only ten minutes away. You are also only five to ten minutes away from downtown South Bend where the Morris Performing Arts Theatre can be found, as well as many galleries.",
            "Again, I did not eat on campus ever. I commuted from my job to class and home. I usually brought my food with me.",
            "I did not live in a dorm. I recommend living on campus if you want the college experience. However, from what I have seen, the dorms are nice.",
            "Depending on what classes you take, your academics could be challenging or easy. I recommend retaking your placement tests until you get the highest score you could possibly get. After high school, I took a year off of school and when I took my placement exams, I scored much lower than I wanted. Take advantage of every opportunity.",
            "If you would like to truly have the college experience, stay on campus. I commuted and it was difficult to be involved in anything on campus. You will feel detached because you are not there. Also, speak up in class if you are having trouble understanding. Take the time to meet with your professors and get the help you need. They are on your side and have plenty of resources to help you.",
            "Indiana University South Bend is a school full of diversity. From the staff to the students, every person attending has a voice and strive to be heard. I am glad that I chose to attend a school with such rich and genuine people who push for knowledge and deeper understanding of their world and each other."

I emailed and called my advisor more times than i can remember and never recieved a response. if you want to talk to your advisor you have to march into their office and demand a meeting., 84652=The dining area was just redone in 2012. It not only is a good place to eat, it's also nice to study. There are several options available at lunch time., 63085=IUSB just re-did The Grille and I must say that the food is very good and worth the price ! The Grille closes at 2:30 p.m so most students go to the SAC cafe and enjoy snacks, if all else fails, they are plenty of vending machines., 207467=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Tips for prospective students If you are looking for a cheap college tuition, this is the college for you. But if you are looking for a great campus experience, look else where, like Ball State or Purdue. Bang for the buck For around $3,000 dollars,(for me at least) you can't beat it. Am enjoying being here IUSB won't give you a campus experience like other bigger colleges. There isn't much to do as far as on campus activities. Am learning a lot I am currently a freshman majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I am learning a lot from these classes.
