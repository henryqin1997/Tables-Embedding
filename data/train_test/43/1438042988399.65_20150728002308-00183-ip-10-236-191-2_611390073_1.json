The only software I current have (and use quite a bit) is Nikon\u0092s free ViewNX2. I actually am quite impressed on what I can do with VNX so I have been putting off purchasing software and allocated my funds to lens. I think my kit is good for now for a beginner and so I have been researching SW. Most of the threads I read compare CNX to the full PS CS. My question is; with limited funds should I be looking at Elements 11 or CNX. I have tried a trial of Elements\u0085 but maybe because I am used to ViewNX2, I was not too impressed. I guess I need to get a trial of CNX Any thoughts on the first SW to purchase? Much Thanks, Regards, Joseph JKFuller | | Mon 17-Dec-12 11:48 PM Registered since 21st Mar 2012",

I think your real choices are between Lightroom and CNX2. That's a bit of a choice between an Adobe workflow and a Nikon workflow. Both",
