I realize it's September, but keep in mind we just won or swept a series from *each* of our division rivals. They know we are coming. Mark, great writing, excellent insights, just a thoroughly enjoyable blog.Thanks for the hard work.I really enjoyed my imaginary friends here. Thanks for the good posts. This really is a group that, as Sec3 would say, can only be called SofaKing awesome. (One of the best frigging posts this year by Sec3 IMO.), 113376=Conine just took their championship flags down, and is going to take them by copter to the new stadium, so they can be raised on their new poles.One of the reasons for the early start.They are introducing the players from the 1993 team right now, this show may run a bit long.Way to go Nats. We have come a long way in the \"plan\" and I expect Rizzo and his crew to get us to the next level, next year. They have drafted well for the success I see on the horizon.A special thanks to Mark and Mrs. Z for another great year. Everybody be safe.david, 21547=N. Cognito:I'll keep that to myself :)Seriously, it's impossible to have any negative feelings about the 2011 season. The team exceeded virtually every preseason win total prediction, and it did so mostly by getting better than expected production from guys under 30 who are under club control for at least another couple years. What's not to love?, 66951=I would pull him here. 1 hit, 10ks in 6 innings. Also hit 100.Hallelujah and looking forward to April., 35454=If nominated, I will not run.Sec 3, My Sofa said\u2026 because we're actually going to have a live episode of Beltway Baseball, \u2026 handing out season awards, Awards? Was I nominated? Or do I just get a nice \"parting (hint hint)\" gift? September 28, 2011 2:26 PM, 153926=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows. Here's the 2015 schedule (subject to change)... MON: 12:45 p.m. TUE: 2:30 p.m. WED: 4:30 p.m. THU: 2:30 p.m. FRI: 5:30 p.m. SAT: 10:30 a.m. *All times Eastern. You can also listen to the station on 94.3 FM, 92.7 FM and online at ESPN980.com. Click here for past audio clips., 124397=I remember someone on here in April or May when the Nats had a lead and lost it in a 9th inning disaster and the poster swore away the Nats forever. Boy did he miss some great baseball., 136192=My numbers for 2011:80 is the number of wins achieved by the 2011 Nats74 was the number of walks Jayson Werth drew in 201168 is the positive run differential for the Nats improvement from 2010 to 2011. 31 fewer runs scored. 99 fewer runs given up by the Nats.60 is the number of games Ryan Zimmerman missed in 201144 is the number of Home wins the Nats had this season going 44-3643 is the number of saves Drew Storen had43 is the number of games Adam LaRoche appeared in 201140 is the number of runners thrown out attempting to steal by Ramos (23) Pudge (13) and JFlo (4). The Nats have the best Caught Stealing percentage by their catchers36 is the amount wins & the amount of losses the Nats had against the NL East opponents including winning records against the Phillies31 is the # of HRs the Nats offensive MVP (according to FP & Bob) hit this year. Morse would hit 31 HRs and drive in 98 RBIs. 21 is the number of HRs that Danny Espinosa hit to tie for the Rookie HR lead21 is the number of HRs that Beast Mode hit that were over 400 ft. which was 68% of all of his HRs at least that distance. 466 feet was his longest at Wrigley. Total HR distance was 12,788 feet or 2.42 miles.19 is the times Danny Espinosa was HBP15 is the number of HRs Wilson Ramos hit this year to tie the all-time catcher's record for Washington baseball teams15 is the number of sacrifice bunts Livan Hernandez had in 201114 was the number of wild wild pitches by MPHrod14 I believe was the number of walk-off wins in 2011 which is tied for the MLB lead. Of course none more exciting than the Walk-off HR delivered by Zim, Ramos, Morse and Espinosa12 is the number of wins this season in extra innings which was a dramatic turnaround from the prior season where the Nats were 3-1011 is the improvement year over year in wins going from 69 to 80 from 2010 to 201111 is the error improvement by Ian Desmond going from 34 last season to 23 this year.11 is the place the Nats ended up in the NL for average runs scored for the season just ahead of the Marlins by the smallest of percentages11 is the jersey number of the Face of the Franchise who we hope signs a contract extension10 is the number of wins against the Phillies this season going 10-810 is the number of shutouts the Nats pitchers combined for10 was the consecutive wins in the Nats road winning streak10 was the tops in wins by a starter by John Lannan9 outfield assists by Rick Ankiel and they were all amazing8 was the number of games in the Nats winning streak 6/10 \u2013 6/188 was the place Jordan Zimmermann ended up as tops in the NL for WHIP at 1.1477 RBIs by Livan Hernandez to lead the pitchers 6 is where the Nats pitching ended amongst all the teams in the National League and 5th fewest in HRs given up5 is the XBH by Nats pitchers. 3 doubles and 2 HRs4 wins for comeback player Chien-Ming Wang as well as 4 for Ross Detwiler3 the number of managers the Nats had this season2 is the number of wins interim manager John McLaren had in 2011 with a 2-1 record1.83 was Tyler Clippard's final ERA1 pitch 1 HR for Tom Milone on the 1st pitch he saw in the Majors. It was 1 more HR than Matt Stairs hit1 hit for Chien-Ming Wang which was the 1st of his career0.982 is the field percentage of Danny Espinosa who flashed Gold Glove quality at 2nd base0.309 is the team OBP and is the one area the Nats really need to improve0 is the number of losses incurred by Tyler Clippard who was the Nats All Star as he finished with a 3-0 record, 3045=NATIONALS at MARLINS Where: Sun Life Stadium Gametime: 4:10 p.m. TV: MASN2 Radio: WFED (1500 AM), WHFS (1580 AM), XM 189 Weather: Partly cloudy, 85 degrees, Wind 9 mph in from RF, 14505=If Mark is right, I think that's a pretty weak move. According to my math would have to go 0 for 5 to get his average below .300, and even then it would be .2998, which they apparently round up if they're calling his current average .303, since he's actually hitting .3026.And anyways, if the Nats are winning by that point a defensive substitution before his 5th AB would be not only reasonable but probably prudent. If they're losing big, nobody will care if he's pulled. And if they're in a close game, I'd rather they give themselves the best chance to win than protect a .300 hitter, and I'd hope the club would feel the same way. That's just me. In any event, given the season Morse has had it's pretty unlikely he'd go 0 for 4 without getting on base in his first four plate appearances anyway.And if we're showing concern about meaningless benchmarks, how about giving Strasburg the best possible team behind him to get him a win in 2011? It's crazy that he doesn't have a win considering how he's pitched., 86735=Very nice to see Cora's triple not go to waste. Six more outs to go for an 80- win season. Didn't think we'd be there back in April., 166465=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC. Images provided by Getty Images. Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 75869=Gonat @5:39, something Lannan needs to work on BUNTING., 143422=Nope, and how about those Rays?? (And how about \"Guns\" Peralta on the mound for them?)Anonymous said\u2026 It looks like the Boston/Baltimore game is in a rain delay, middle of the 7th inning. Would the umps ever consider calling the game in a situation like this, with Boston leading by one run in a critical game? September 28, 2011 9:52 PM, 998=And so the end has arrived. The 2011 season closes today for the Nationals, who also get the honor of closing down Sun Life Stadium (and not a moment too soon). The Marlins expect a large crowd today, and there will be plenty of familiar faces in attendance for their fans, including former Florida World Series heroes Livan Hernandez and Ivan Rodriguez.}",
