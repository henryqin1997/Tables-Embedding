You take an oath to uphold and support the Constitution of the United States and the laws of this nation.\u00a0 Isn\u2019t it time you did everything you could to uphold that oath \u2014 for your nation, for this generation and every one that follows, and for the very foundations of our government?\u00a0 That responsibility rests on your shoulders, and we will hold you to every ounce of it or you\u2019ll have to step aside for someone who will actually do the job.\u00a0\u00a0 And last I checked, the Fourth Amendment doesn\u2019t have an exception for the President\u2019s demands not quite meeting the letter of the law that day. For every elected leader out there let me just say this: actions speak far louder than words, and we will be watching what you do today\u2026and what you do not do. So think carefully before you try a dodge and phony show of support without actually providing any support on this filibuster. That goes for procedural manipulations as well. We have long memories\u2026and we have learned a lot about primary challenges that we are willing to put to good use.",
