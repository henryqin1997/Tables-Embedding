Expanding the input key in this manner allows greater randomness for the subkeys used during the encryption rounds, without requiring a key of very large size to be input to the cipher. For example, in the preferred embodiment, the input key is 128 bits long (4 words, each having 32 bits), whereas the expanded key is 2304 bits long (using the formulas defined above, 72 words each having 32 bits). The entries in this expanded key array are then used as subkeys in the key-dependent rounds of encryption, and the corresponding rounds of decryption. Techniques for key expansion are well known in the art. The following is one way of expanding keys for use with the present invention., 34501=IBM application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets While the preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described, additional variations and modifications in that embodiment may occur to those skilled in the art once they learn of the basic inventive concepts. Therefore, it is intended that the appended claims shall be construed to include both the preferred embodiment and all such variations and modifications as fall within the spirit and scope of the invention. For an odd-numbered round, the processing is similar to that just described for even rounds. The only difference is the order in which the different data words are used by the operations, as shown by the \u201cC\u201d language statements. By the end of this even-numbered round, all of the data words have been rotated, the value of each data word has impacted a rotation operation, each data word has been exclusive OR'd with another data word, and each data word has a new value. The third and fourth subrounds for the even-numbered rounds are similar. In the third subround, the next preceding subkey is subtracted from D[0]; D[0] is rotated to the right by the amount indicated by D[1]; D[2] is subtracted from D[1]; and D[1] is exclusive OR'd with D[0], forming a new D[0]. In the fourth subround, the next preceding subkey is subtracted from D[1]; D[1] is rotated 7 positions to the right; and D[3] is exclusive OR'd with D[1], forming a new value for D[1].",
