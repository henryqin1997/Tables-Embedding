            "I have been on this campus at various times of the day and night and have never felt unsafe or in danger in anyway.",
            "Saint Leo is good for any and all students, while their academic courses are a little more rigourous than a community or state college you will see the benefit of the harder assignments pay off quickly.",
            "I enjoy attending Saint Leo because it is a Christian based school and being raised in the christian faith I feel at ease. While the religion portion is never forced or mingled into the lectures you know it is there when we have group discussions.",
            "This is my fourth college in my educational career and so far it has been my favorite. Everyone from the academic counselors, to the financial aid, and even the IT support are awesome to work with.",
            "If you are attending Saint Leo you are only minutes from one the top 4 largest cities in Florida. You have the beaches only a couple minutes away and Orlando is only an hour to your north. The nightlife, and community is a great place for anyone coming into Tampa.",
            "The food is good, I have only been on campus a couple of times since I am an online student but I only live two hours from campus and when I have stopped in it has been good.",
            "I do not live on campus.",
            "The classes are a little challenging at times but the professors are always available and very willing to work with you to help you succeed to your full potential. The classes focus a lot of working together and class discussions.",
            "Even if you are unsure of what you want to go for call the academic advisor and tell them your situation. They will walk you through your options and take as much time as needed to help you achieve your goals.",
            "Saint Leo has been a blessing since the first day I contacted an admission advisor. They have been friendly, courteous, and very knowledgable on every aspect. This has been a wonderful experience all the way around."

I will begin on April 29th., 490375=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 207464=I have been enrolled at Saint Leo (Adult Center, Georgia) since March 2012 and can't express how much I've appreciated the professionalism of the instructors. As a non-traditional student I was apprehensive about returning to school. I haven't regretted my decision!, 89042=campus was founded in 1889., 149561=Staff has been very helpful in transitioning from my community college. Financial aid representative is easy to work with and informative. Look forward to starting my first semester Fall 2012., 147549=I will be attending Saint Leo in the fall of 2012 as a freshman., 412024=As a commuter, a meal plan is not required. That being said, I have gone into the main dining area a few times. The food is great; it is buffet style. The only draw back for commuters and the main dining area is the price, $10 as of 2013. The Lion's Lair is more reasonable on price but it is not a buffet and there are limited options. However, it offers grilled items, deli items, snacks, drinks, and items needed for your dorm if you live on campus.}",
