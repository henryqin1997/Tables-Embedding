Also, when a guy proposes, the other guys in his dorm hall sneak up on him and thrown him in Cedar Lake. The cardboard canoe race is put on every September by the engineering department. All of the freshmen engineering majors have to build a cardboard canoe and paddle 3 people across the lake without sinking., 372210=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 257869=Every December before finals we have Campus Christmas. All the dorms decorate their halls and compete for best decorated. Our student activities board puts on lots of fun activities and our president reads us a Christmas story., 101541=Make sure to pray talking to God about the decision, don't just go with it. Try to transfer classes from back home or other schools online. You can save a lot of money that way, and honestly I didn't gain anything better from taking the gen eds at Cedarville that I wouldn't have elsewhere. Try to find all your books on classifieds or online, the bookstore is more expensive than necessary. Consider getting an older version of the textbook. You can email your professor as soon as they give you your schedule and ask if an older text book will work, sometimes they can be a pain if you do homework problems a lot, but if you are just reading the book, it really doesn't make a difference. Get enough sleep, hardly anyone does here, but it's critical, and 7 hours is not a good nights sleep, try 8. If you have an 8 o'clock class, it's probably better to switch until 9 unless you are really disciplined about getting to sleep early. An hour might not seem a big deal, but it adds up pretty quickly when it's an hour less than you need every night. I personally need closer to 9 to be rested.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Cedarville is an expensive school. I am going to be in major debt when I have graduated. I tend to think that the education is worth the money, but sometimes it feels like I might be getting screwed. Am enjoying being here The student body at Cedarville is very friendly and accepting. After just one year I have friends that I know will last for a lifetime. Cedarville itself has many events that make socializing very easy. From music nights at the coffee shop, to many class parties. I have had issues with decisions the administration has made in the past year, but those are outweighed by the positive experiences at Cedarville. Am learning a lot Cedarville has many learning opportunities on campus, in class and out. The professors and the staff are all excellent in their field, and are all wonderful teachers. The classes are very well balanced, not too hard, but challenging enough to teach you what you need to know. In addition to this, there are many opportunities to join student groups that are specifically designed to teach you how to function in your chosen field. The general education classes can be boring it you are not engaged in the subject, but usually",
