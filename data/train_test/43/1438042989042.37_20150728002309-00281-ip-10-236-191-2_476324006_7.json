    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention has been described with respect to a preferred embodiment thereof, it is to be also understood that it is not to be sole limited since changes and modifications can be made therein which are within the full intended scope of this invention as defined by the appended claims. As is demonstrated in more detail in the commonly owned co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/886,901 filed Jul. 2, 1997 entitled METHOD FOR ENHANCING GERMINATION, incorporated herein by reference, the enhanced growth characteristic should continue to effect the seed and resultant plant for extended periods of time. Enhanced germination effects continue to manifest in sonicated seeds after periods of extended drying down and rehydration. The series of experiments depicted in FIGS. 22-27 demonstrates the response to uptake over time for sonicated and soaked groups of seed, and again demonstrates the superiority of the sonication process. In principle, the overall impact of the above experiments demonstrates the ability of the imbibition process to uptake a variety of substances into seeds of a variety of different plants. As a result, introduction of any number of substances capable of imparting growth enhancing characteristics to a plant can be affected through the imbibition process of the present invention. FIG. 27 shows the results of an experiment identical to the experiment described above and represented by the data shown in FIG. 22, except that the time was extended from",
