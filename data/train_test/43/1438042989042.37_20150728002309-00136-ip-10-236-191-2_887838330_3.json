    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{5948=Rock has always been the kind of guy to blaze his own path, and the reason he was making headlines headed into 2013 had very little to do with the commercial appeal of his albums. Instead, he was riding a pact with promoters and management to not only lower the fees for his concert tickets to $5, but drop the prices of the tickets themselves to just $20., 5574=The pact was made. And the result? After fighting tooth and nail and using his power to exact change, Rock had Live Nation kiosks set up in Wal-Mart stores across America. For just $20, fans could buy a ticket, including parking, with no fee. And since the deal was brokered, ticket sales have doubled or tripled from 2011 (In short, exceeding everyone's expectations)., 4005=It wasn't until rap-metal artists like Korn and Limp Bizkit began to dominate the radio waves that Kid Rock got a real second chance to make a first impression. Signed by Atlantic Records, a big campaign to push \"Bawitdaba\" made the single a smash hit. The follow-up, \"Cowboy,\" made Kid Rock a global phenomenon, and the country-tinged \"Picture\" with Sheryl Crow in 2001 introduced his music to a whole new audience., 6935=Kid Rock was recently part of a huge birthday bash for Lionel Richie at the DTE Energy Music Theatre on June 20, 2014. Rock escorted a large sheet cake on stage, singing \"Happy Birthday\" before the two performed an encore version of \"We Are the World\" to cap off the 24-song show. Just a few weeks before, Rock played a two-night stand at The (Las Vegas) Cosmopolitan's swanky Boulevard Pool deck. The opening set was courtesy of DJ M!keAttack, and Rock kicked off both shows by performing \"Devil Without a Cause.\" The back-to-back events also included \"Rock N' Roll Jesus,\" \"Cowboy\" and audience favorite \"Bawitdaba.\", 2557=Kid Rock fans are going to have a lot to look forward to next year. The Detroit rocker/rapper has just announced that he\u2019ll be releasing a new album, tilted First Kiss, on February 24. Mr. Rock also revealed that he\u2019ll be hitting the road in the summer to promote the record with his Twisted Brown\u2026, 7602=Of course the almost-too-good-to-be-true deal couldn't last forever, and ticket prices for most of Kid's upcoming 2014 summer concerts are back to average price. This includes shows in Tucson ($60+), The House of Blues in West Hollywood ($110) and Louisville, Kentucky ($65) \u2026 just to name a few., 3541=Used to making headlines for his personal life as much as his music, Kid Rock had a five-month marriage to actress Pamela Anderson, numerous run-ins with the law, and once filed a lawsuit in a California court to stop the release of a purported sex tape. Still, he appeared on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight in 2011 and said he has no regrets about anything he has done in the past., 3144=In May 2012, Kid Rock became the first of a handful of high-profile musicians to endorse Mitt Romney's GOP campaign for President of the United States. He performed at the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida and is expected to release his 10th studio album in November., 6165=Kid Rock released the album \"Rebel Soul\" in the fall of 2012, with the cut \"Let's Ride\" as its lead single. And ride he did, but not just in a quick run to the top of the charts., 4833=American singer-songwriter and rapper Kid Rock exploded onto the scene with his \"Devil Without a Cause\" album in 1998. Born and raised in the Detroit metro area, the bad-boy rocker is popular for songs like \"Cowboy,\" \"Only God Knows Why,\" \"Bawitdaba,\" and \"All Summer Long\"\u009d which charted #1 in eight different countries across Europe and Australia., 4415=Born Bob Ritchie, the man who would come to be known as Kid Rock immersed himself in rap music as a youngster. He learned to breakdance, performed in talent shows and recorded his first set of demos by 1988. It led to a contract with Jive Records and a debut album, \"Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast,\" but Kid Rock was dropped from the Jive roster after the album failed to take off.}",
