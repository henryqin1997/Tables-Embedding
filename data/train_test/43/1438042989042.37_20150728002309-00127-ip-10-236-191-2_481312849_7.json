Mechanical rotation generally provides better image quality than use of a phased-array system, but the design of such catheters is problematic since the designs must provide for rotating the transducer and/or an associated mirror at speeds usually in the range from 500 to 2000 rpm. Moreover, the interior blood vessel must be protected from the rotating components, which could cause substantial injury should they come in contact with the blood vessel., 25407=The present application is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 07/976,228, filed on Nov. 13, 1992 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,314,408. The present application contains subject matter related to that of Ser. No. 07/975,769 and 07/975,752, both filed on Nov. 13, 1992.

    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be obvious that certain changes and modifications may be practiced which will still fall within the scope of the appended claims. In the case where at least the distal end of the proximal region is transparent (as illustrated in FIG. 12), it is not essential that a marker be provided on the catheter body itself. The marker may be a work element or other structure disposed in one of the lumens, indicating to the user that the guidewire is to be inserted through the other, unoccupied lumen. Thus, the present invention includes the use of internal markers within one or more of the proximal lumens to provide visual indication that another of the lumens is to receive the guidewire. As will be appreciated, with very small catheters, it will frequently be difficult to see which of the proximal lumens 210 or 212 the guidewire is being introduced into from the common lumen 208. By providing the visible marker 220, it is much easier for the user to identify the desired target lumen. Once the target lumen is identified, the user can manipulate the catheter 200 so that the guidewire passes into the target lumen. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 14, the catheter body can be bent at or near the",
