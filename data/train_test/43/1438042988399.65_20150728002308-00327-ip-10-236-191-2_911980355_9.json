            "I always feels safe here. The campus police are on top of their game if something goes wrong but, generally speaking, nothing of concern ever happens.",
            "There's always something going on here on campus. There are tons of clubs and activities.",
            "Students who are open-minded and friendly will thrive here. I think it is important for me to stress that Morris is not for everyone. It is a fantastic school, but the remote location and small student population is not going to be everyone's cup of tea.",
            "Zombie prom. Yeah, we love zombies here.",
            "Private school feel for the public school price. Because the Morris campus was originally a school for Native Americans, students with Native American blood get free tuition. Also, there are fantastic scholarship opportunities for those students who exceeded in academics in high school.",
            "Because Morris is in the middle of nowhere, many people get the impression that there is nothing to do here. That is so far from true it is almost laughable. There is ALWAYS something going on on campus whether it be a club meeting, a concert, or a dance. There are also lots of opportunities to make your own fun here, whether that be staying in and having a movie night with the floor or going out and making a visit to Pomme de Terre. Also, a car can get you to Alexandria or Willmar in under an hour if you're feeling like a trip to a more populated area for the day.",
            "It depends on the day really. In general, food on the weekends is really iffy. There are some meals that food service has nailed and that are delicious. Other times, the selection leaves many of us wondering what were they thinking?! The desserts are continuously delicious though. :) Also, as a vegetarian, I think food service does a pretty good job of serving to people with special diets. I can always find something to eat.",
            "AWESOME. I love the sense of community here at Morris. The Community Advisers (our version of RA's) work hard to bring the floors together and to ensure that first year students have an easy transition. From talking with friends who go to other colleges, Community Advisers are much more involved with their residents here than RA's at other colleges. The dorms are very nice and well taken care of. Also, the furniture is very nice. Other colleges that I've visited have the desks and drawers built into the rooms, but the rooms here have movable furniture which gives you a plethora of options when it comes to arranging your room! The bathrooms are smaller, but the trade of for that is large, spacious lounges and kitchens that are nice meeting places for the floor. Many people do move off campus after freshman year because it is much cheaper, but there are options for upperclassmen who like the the community that dorm life offers, or simply the convenience of living on campus.",
            "It depends on the class and the professor. My first semester was extremely easy, but my second semester has been more difficult. I do feel like my high school prepared me extremely well for college, which I think has made a difference in how I view the college course load. However, I am expecting my workload to become more difficult as I move up into upper level classes. In general, the professors are very approachable and the class sizes are smaller, which I think makes a huge difference in the academic experience here.",
            "Stay overnight with a current student. I think this is a general rule for any prospective student who is seriously considering a college. It's a great way to see what college life is like on that particular campus. My overnight experience was one of the main reasons I ended up choosing Morris. Also, get to know the admissions counselors here. They will remember you. You are more than a face to them, you are a name and someone that they'd love to see on campus as a student in the coming years! Also, many of them are Morris graduates, so they not only have experience at Morris as an employee, but also as a student.",
            "Morris is a lovely little college campus in the heart of rural Minnesota. Because it is a University of Minnesota school, I like to think students here get the best of both worlds - the resources one would find to be available at a larger institution along with the small, close knit feel of a private college. To make it even more awesome, the campus-community relationship that you'll find here is unlike any other that I know of."

Also, a car can get you to Alexandria or Willmar in under an hour if you're feeling like a trip to a more populated area for the day., 2566=Morris is a great place to go to school! Granted, the town is small (aprox. 5000 people including the college), but there is always something to do. Great, friendly people, wonderful scenery (not to mention Pomme de Terre park), and good food are the hallmarks of this town. The college also does a very good job of having student activities consistent throughout the semester. If you plan on going to Morris I highly suggest you see the improv group, The Unusual Suspects. The only thing that seems to be lacking is places to go shopping. However, you'll be so busy with everything else that you won't need to! But when you decide that you want to, a 50 min. drive will take you to Alexandria or Wilmar where there are stores galore., 1464=At about a third of a private universities cost, it definitely is alot of bang for your buck. And it doesn't end there, Morris is ranked among the top 100 colleges nationally as a best value in the 2009 Kiplinger Best Values in Public Colleges exclusive survey. Also, our students graduate with the least amount of debt in the Midwest! Trust me, things just get even better. This school has the highest graduation rate out of the whole University of Minnesota system. Did i mention free classes? Oh yes, that's right. All credits above 13 (but below 20) are free due to banded tuition. Are you going to graduate in the top 20% of your class? Morris has automatic scholarships for those who do so. Also, the admissions and financial aid staff are amazing in working with you to figure out your financial aid.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here The atmosphere in Morris is very friendly, accepting, inviting and fun. The campus is quirky, and the surrounding neighborhood is small and welcoming. Though there isn't much night life in town, you quickly branch out of the realm of normal entertainment and find creative ways to have fun. Because there aren't night clubs or many other places you'd want to visit when you think of going out on a Friday night, students often seek entertainment on campus. We've got plenty of student organizations here on campus. These are groups that are run entirely by students and overseen by a faculty member of sorts. I'll name just a few off the top of my head: saddle club, fencing, Dungeons and Dragons Club, Ground Quidditch (adapted for Muggles from the Harry Potter books), dance ensemble, anime club, bad movie club, boffers, fight club, math club, swing club, paintball at UMM, organic gardening club. These are only a fraction of the organizations on campus - I haven't even touched all of the political ones! The Office of Student Affairs does a great job of making sure there are things to do on campus every week and on most week nights. There are concerts, open mic night, dances, sports events, drama, and even themed activities (like Zombie Prom, or the Yule Ball). Most of these events are priced between 0 and three dollars, so it won't break the",
