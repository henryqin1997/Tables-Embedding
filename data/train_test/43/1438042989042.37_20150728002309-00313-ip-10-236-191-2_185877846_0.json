The results of the study showed that(11, 25), 120645=Frankfurt has experienced a rash of false insurance claims from pedestrians claiming to be hit and injured by motorists in one very congested part of the city, but these are being handled by the city. In 1992, they recorded more than 3 accidents at each of 54 separate intersections. Recordable accidents must cost more than 3,000 DM ($1,800 U.S.) or result in bodily injury or death. Below 3,000 DM, the claims are settled through insurance firms., 189395=- Cyclist Training in Great Britain - A Report of a Series of Regional Cycling Seminars (January 1993); - Children and Roads: A Safer Way (May 1990); - Road Safety Report (November 1991); - The Older Road User - Measures for Reducing Casualties Among Older People on Our Roads (June 1991); and - Killing Speed and Saving Lives: The Government's Strategy for Tracking the Problem of Excess Speeds on Our Roads (November 1992)., 177142=Cycle and ride lots have been built at outlying tram stations, and bus-tram connections have also been improved. Freiburg's trams are equipped with a bottom step that can be lowered to accommodate the handicapped or elderly. Reduced-cost monthly passes have also been instituted to encourage commuters to leave their cars at home and ride transit. In 1980, there were 27.3 million riders; by 1992, that figure had increased to 54 million. Discount fare passes and new tram line construction, along with other improvements, are credited with a large part of the increase. With 61 percent of operating expenses recovered through farebox revenues, the transit system has an enviable operating record. Nonetheless, a 35 millon DM ($21 million U.S.) annual deficit is incurred., 13121=This report documents the findings of a U.S. study team that visited England, The Netherlands, and Germany. The trip sponsored by the Federal Highway Administration was taken September 3-19, 1993. Members of the study team also spent 1 day in Basel, Switzerland, and obtained a limited amount of information from that visit. The purpose of the trip was to learn as much as possible about practices and policies for improving pedestrian and bicyclist safety and promoting use of these modes. Topics covered included roadway facilities, educational and promotional programs, traffic enforcement issues, and relevant pedestrian and bicyclist safety research., 65026=Germany's current goal is to reduce carbon dioxide levels by 25 percent by the year 2005. Another is to promote more local travel by bicycle as an alternative to motor vehicles, particularly for short commuting trips. The former city of East Berlin has dense land development in a mixed residential and business layout, which is conducive to mass transit, bicycling, and walking. Trip distances there are one-quarter the length of those in other German cities. The former East German government had previously promoted mass transit much more than bicycling and walking. The German government is also interested in promoting bicycle and pedestrian use for recreational travel on holidays and weekends., 188778=* A series of new television films, launched in 1992, promotes safer cycling for children and emphasizes the need for drivers to reduce their speeds in residential areas., 205305=A 1989 study by the Center for Research and Contract Standardization in Civil and Traffic Engineering(21) developed guidelines for moped use of roadways versus separate bicycle paths. One major factor in developing these guidelines was the speed differences between bicycles and mopeds, which is larger than the speed differences between mopeds and other motor vehicles in urban areas. The report recommends that mopeds use the roadway instead of the bicycle path when, 5240=2.

For example, in 1992, a total of 5,546 pedestrians were killed on our nation's highways.(1) In addition, more than 100,000 pedestrians are seriously injured each year in the United States,(2) approximately 700 to 900 bicyclists are killed each year in collisions with motor vehicles, and many thousands are seriously injured. It has been estimated that over a half-million people in the United States are treated each year in hospital emergency rooms for bicycle-related injuries, though many of these do not involve a motor vehicle.(3), 82107=In Cambridge, England, approximately half of the recorded road crashes involve bicyclists, which corresponds to an annual average of 363 out of 711 accidents involving cyclists from 1989 to 1993. In recent years the number of accidents involving cyclists has decreased, from a peak of 400 in 1990 to 330 in 1993, but the high level of cyclist casualties remains of concern. The reduction in cyclist casualties in recent years corresponds to a reduction in vehicular traffic over the same period, largely due to recessionary effects. The city has adopted a planning and transport strategy with the aim of preventing a further increase in car traffic in the city once the recession lifts, in order to maintain the benefits to cyclists and the general environment., 124573=Currently, there is much discussion about how to fund overall transport and traffic programs in Germany. Since 1956, there has been a simple tax formula on gasoline that has funded program costs. With a downcast economy, new, more complicated schemes are being proposed and debated. There exists a tension between Federal and local agencies on how to fund a balanced transportation system., 2231=Baltimore, MD 21210, 188623=* The Princess of Wales attended a luncheon in October of 1991 and spoke in support of the Department of Transport's road safety campaign., 30265=In spite of these statistics on bicyclist and pedestrian injuries, recent surveys have shown that bicycling and walking are among the most popular activities of Americans of all ages. For example, it has been estimated that 131 million Americans regularly walk or bicycle for exercise, recreation, or simply relaxation and enjoyment of the outdoors. Bicycling and walking, however, have still not reached their potential in the United States. According to the Nationwide Personal Transportation Study (NPTS) in 1990, only 0.7 percent of all travel trips (i.e., trips with a purpose) are currently made by bicycling, with 7.2 percent made by walking.(4), 190136=- \"Accident Fact Sheet\" (e.g., Series 2, No. 2 deals with pedestrian accidents in Great Britain); - \"How to Use a Puffin Crossing,\" brochure 1993; - \"Lessons for Life--Teaching Road Safety: For Parents of 1-15 Year Olds,\" 1990; and - Traffic advisory leaflets (e.g., \"Audible and Tactile Signals at Signal Controlled Junctions,\" December 1991), written primarily to provide technical guidance to engineers on installing traffic control devices., 41926=Jan Kerkhof, 118789=The fatality rate (in deaths per 1 million inhabitants) was reported to be 138 for all traffic and 13 for bicyclists. Furthermore, compared to other European cities, bicyclist accident rates in German cities are considerably higher. For example, between 1982 and 1985, the rate of bicycle injury crashes per 100,000 working population was approximately 80 in West Berlin, compared to 33 in Amsterdam, 22 in Copenhagen, and 16 in Stockholm.(11, 15), 188499=* Exhibitions on pedestrian and bicycle safety were run at the annual teacher conferences in 1991 and 1992., 118367=Statistics on bicycle crashes have been documented in several sources. In 1979, 1,174 bicyclists were killed, representing 9 percent of all traffic fatalities. Also, 47,704 crashes involved bicyclist injuries, which represented just under 10 percent of all traffic-related injuries.(11) A study by Pauen-Hoppner reported that more than 60,000 bicyclists were injured in crashes in 1984.(14), 78169=A 1991 study of trips within the city of Basel (i.e., where both ends of the trip are within the city) showed 20 percent pedestrian, 20 percent bicycle, 30 percent transit, and 30 percent automobile use., 61661=Houten was given \"new town\" status in 1979 by The Netherlands' central government in response to a national housing shortage. Under this new town concept, the central government has input on the decisions of where and when new housing is to be built and also provides financing for housing. Houten was chosen as a new town project because of its proximity to the rail line, the freeway, and the town of Utrecht., 33118=While looking for ways to improve programs and facilities for bicycling and walking in the United States, it is critical to review practices that have been used successfully in other countries. Much has been written in recent years regarding many of the successful nonmotorized programs in western Europe, including The Netherlands, Germany, England, and Switzerland. A 1992 report for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) (A Study of Bicycle and Pedestrian Programs in European Countries) documents some of the successful activities found in these and other countries throughout Europe.(5) For example, a variety of speed reduction measures (often called traffic calming techniques) are used in cities throughout western Europe to slow motor vehicle traffic and enhance the safety and movement of bicyclists and pedestrians. Auto restrictive zones, pedestrian and bicyclist streets, street narrowing measures, speed humps, and other traffic diversion techniques have all been successfully used in different ways to reduce motor vehicle volumes or speeds, particularly on selected downtown and residential streets. Traffic calming is most successful when done on an areawide basis as opposed to \"spot\" traffic calming measures., 66951=Frankfurt, with a population of 680,000, has an estimated 300,000 commuters daily: 200,000 by automobile and 100,000 by trains and buses. This distribution is quite different from 1961, when 100,000 commuted by train and bus and only 30,000 by auto. Frankfurt is a vibrant commercial center with a strong financial district in the city center. There are no special efforts made exclusively for bicyclists, such as those in Munster, Freiburg, and Erlangen., 82921=Each year in The Netherlands, official statistics show approximately 50,000 road users are injured (minor or severe injuries).(8) In 1991, 13,303 severely injured road users were officially reported; of those, 1,281 people died and the rest were admitted to hospitals. Thirty-nine percent (5,236) of these serious injuries involved car passengers, 23 percent (3,115) were cyclists, and 10 percent (1,347) were pedestrians, as shown in Table 1. Moped riders accounted for 17 percent (2,234) of the injured victims. Among persons aged 65 and older, pedestrians and bicyclists were greatly overrepresented, compared to car passengers.(7), 212037=According to Doldissen and Draeger(26) in 1990, other effects of the traffic calming included a doubling of bicycle use in Buxtehude in the 4 years following the project and an increase in bicycle crashes (primarily noninjury). The proportion of bicyclists considered at fault in crashes dropped from 45 percent to 35 percent after traffic calming measures were implemented.(11, 26) For neighborhoods in the Berlin study area, there was a 16 percent reduction in bicycle-related crashes and a 50 percent increase in bicycle use.(11, 27), 64633=With the unification of eastern and western Germany, the population of Germany reached 79.8 million in 1990. (West Germany had a population of just below 60 million prior to unification.) Over the past 20 years, bicycle sales, use, and crashes have increased. For example, bicycle ownership per 1,000 increased from 429 in 1973-74 to 593 in 1980 and to 726 in 1985-86.(11), 207368=Numerous research studies have been conducted in Germany in recent years on pedestrian and bicycle facilities and safety. A 1994 report by Clarke(13) provides an overview of much of the relevant bicycle studies. The following sections summarize some important German research., 75788=A 1986 survey indicated that bike trips accounted for 6 percent of travel in West Berlin and 2 percent in East Berlin. It is now 7 percent in Berlin versus 10 percent for work trips throughout Germany. Walking now accounts for 12 percent to 14 percent of all work trips. It was also reported that on a distance-of-travel basis, cars are 8 times safer than bicycles and 20 times safer than motorcycles. When factoring travel time, bicyclists have 30 percent higher risk than motorists of being involved in a crash., 191106=* McDonald's developed a \"safety park\" for each store in 1990, which encourages their store managers to support local child road-safety activities., 77679=Within Freiburg, 80 percent of all trips do not exceed 5 km in length, and 60 percent of trips do not exceed 3 km. These short trips are likely candidates for conversion to transit, bicycling, or walking. In terms of modal split, private cars captured 60 percent of the trips in 1976 but only 46 percent in 1992. Public transit increased from 22 percent to 27 percent between 1976 and 1992, while bicycle use increased from 18 to 27 percent., 239=October 1994, 206459=A 1991 study by Grontmij(22) evaluated the effect of implementing 30-km/hr zones in 15 municipalities in The Netherlands. A before-and-after analysis was conducted, using control areas and accident characteristics such as type of location; weather conditions; time; type of accident; and involvement of pedestrians, cyclists, or moped riders. A statistical analysis revealed that the 30-km/hr zones reduced total crashes by 10 percent to 15 percent, compared to control areas. Crashes involving only motor vehicles dropped by 15 percent, and between motor vehicles and \"slow traffic\" (assumed to refer to pedestrians and bicyclists), dropped by 36 percent. Less crash reduction was found for bicycle-related crashes, which according to the study team was due to the types of various speed reduction measures used.(22), 64061=The Delft policy on cycling encourages public participation. The cycle plan has no stated objectives specifically related to reducing motor vehicle traffic; rather, it encourages people to travel more frequently by bicycle and to feel safer and more comfortable while doing so. In 1985, the Ministry of Transport and Public Works sponsored a film that documents bicycle policies and facilities in Delft. One bicycle promotion program in Delft includes a poster with the message \"Delft can do better without your car.\", 35781=The purpose of this report is to document the findings of a European project team visit to England, The Netherlands, and Germany, which was sponsored by FHWA and conducted on September 3-19, 1993. Discussions of practices in Great Britain in this report refer to those generally used in England, Scotland, and Wales, and not those in Ireland. Certain study team members also spent 1 day in Basel, Switzerland, and a limited amount of information is provided from that visit. The report documents findings from many areas, including planning practices for pedestrians and bicyclists, roadway facilities, educational and promotional programs, traffic enforcement issues, and some of the relevant pedestrian and bicyclist research that has been conducted in these countries. It is hoped that the findings in this report can be used in the United States to accelerate our progress toward improving the quality of life and safety for pedestrians and bicyclists in the years ahead., 186969=A publicity campaign has been used in Great Britain since 1990 to raise public awareness of child road safety problems and to suggest ways for parents, schools, and drivers to help reduce child casualties. The campaign, \"Children and Roads: A Safer Way,\" has used national television commercials supported by posters and leaflets. The campaign promotes driver safety with the slogan \"Kill Your Speed, Not a Child.\" This campaign encourages drivers to reduce speeds in residential areas where children often cross streets. The major objective of this campaign is to reduce the chances of death or serious injuries. The use of 20-mph zones on selected residential streets in recent years has accompanied this program. The campaign has also focused heavily on the \"Cycle Safe\" theme of promoting the use of cycle helmets and other safe cycling actions.(13), 209665=In 1987, Richard(24) reported that bicycle crashes at intersections were reduced significantly in a demonstration project in Detmold. The projects involved raising the elevation of bicycle paths at intersections to create motorist speed humps and marking the bicycle route with paint or special paving material.(11, 24) Other types of intersection treatments to accommodate bicyclists (but for which no formal evaluations were found) include the following:(11), 223364=1.

In 1976, the bicycle path network consisted of 41 km of unconnected, fragmented facilities. By 1987, the system had grown to 135 km of interconnected, efficient pathways and lanes. The bicycle network has been integrated with 30-km/hr zones on neighborhood streets. Freiburg has 800,000 DM ($480,000 U.S.) per year budgeted for bicycleway maintenance of pavements, signs, and markings. The city permits cycles to ride the opposite direction down a one-way residential street using contraflow lanes., 85645=Table 1 Number of seriously injured road accident victims in The Netherlands in 1991, by transport mode and age of victim.7, 37903=During the period of September 3B19, 1993, study team members visited officials from national transport departments, cities, universities, consulting firms, and other organizations in England, The Netherlands, and Germany. The representatives who met with U.S. study team members are listed below., 204563=Studies in The Netherlands have attempted to compare the safety of on-road bicycle lanes with separate bicycle paths (termed \"bicycle tracks\"). A 1988 study by Willeman(20) analyzed bicycle and moped crashes on both types of facilities. The study found that cyclists are involved in fewer crashes on cycle tracks than on bicycle lanes. Bicycle lanes are typically safer at intersections than cycle tracks, however. Moped riders are at greater risk of collisions while traveling on cycle tracks, and most collisions occur at intersections with roadways. Furthermore, moped riders are also more likely to collide with pedestrians and bicyclists when traveling on bicycle tracks than on other roads.(20), 188965=* New criteria for setting speed limits were published by the Transport Department in February 1993. Further, a policy document--\"Killing Speed, Saving Lives\"--was issued in January 1993 to set current and future policy in Great Britain., 186113=In most local jurisdictions, bicycle training for children is offered by training programs approved by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. Approximately 275,000 to 300,000 children aged 9 and 10 years old take part in the program each year, which is about 21 percent of the population in this age group. One such training program is currently being evaluated with the objective of improving it. Since 1947, when the first Cycling Proficiency Test was given, various cycle training programs have been offered. Programs were revised in the late 1970's and in 1982. The latest revision, in 1992, known as \"Righttrack Cycling Awareness Programme,\" helps young cyclists \"learn to assess traffic situations, recognize potential hazards, and be able to make appropriate decisions about what to do.\"(13), 5099=1. Number of seriously injured road accident victims in The Netherlands in 1991, by transport mode and age . . . . . . . . . . .20, 80028=In terms of bicycle injuries in 1992, 24,962 accidents were reported, in which 204 cyclists were killed, 3,787 were seriously injured, and 20,764 received minor injuries. The cyclists most at risk in Great Britain include children and teenagers. In terms of the cause of cycle injuries, over half of child cycle accidents resulted from children playing or doing tricks, while three-quarters involve no other vehicle. (Note that unlike accident statistics in many other countries, which include only crashes involving motor vehicles, Great Britain's Department of Transport also includes bicycle injuries that do not involve a motor vehicle.) As with pedestrian casualties, 90 percent of bicycle casualties occur on built-up roads. Approximately 74 percent of bicycle casualties occur at intersections.(13), 196080=A 1992 report by Briese(17) investigated bicycle safety education in Germany. He concluded that the primary cause of bicycle crashes is not the lack of knowledge of traffic rules and regulations. Instead, he concludes that a major cause is the lack of psychological and motor skills necessary for bicycling, particularly for children younger than 8 years old. As a result, a new bicyclist education program has been developed that focuses on teaching these skills, while stressing that a child cannot be a safe cyclist, even with these skills.(13, 17), 191280=* Texaco launched a ,3 million (about $4.5 million U.S.) television and poster safety campaign in 1990. The campaign included the free distribution of 5.5 million fluorescent/retroreflective stickers, as well as the distribution of a safety education campaign (\"Secondary Steps\") to schools. In October 1991, a follow-up campaign was held with television advertising and distribution of safety packs containing fluorescent laces and materials. Texaco has continued to support the safety campaign with posters and other activities., 78503=According to the official statistics of Great Britain's Department of Transport, there were 51,587 road crashes resulting in injury to pedestrians in 1992. Of those, 1,347 pedestrians were killed, 12,841 seriously injured, and 37,399 sustained minor injuries. Approximately 1 in 6, or 17 percent, people injured in road crashes is a pedestrian. Since 1966, pedestrian deaths have dropped by more than 50 percent and are at their lowest level since such records were first kept in 1926.(13), 104907=Table 2 Number of seriously injured road accident victims in The Netherlands in 1991, by transport mode, collision partner, and type of road.7, 49022=One of the concerns expressed involved reduced mobility for children in recent years. For example, Meyer Hillman discussed the concept that children are given significantly less license to travel independently than previously, due largely to lack of adequate walkways and street networks that allow safe walking and bicycling. A comparison of 1971 and 1990 survey data seemed to indicate a \"dramatic\" reduction in the free mobility of children. He felt this had implications for their rights and for their physical, social, and emotional development. Considerable controversy also exists with respect to the use of bicycle helmets in Great Britain, as discussed elsewhere in more detail.(6), 191837=* In May 1990, the Pilot Traffic Club launched a preschool (ages 3 to 5) traffic safety education program in the eastern region of England, with approximately 75,000 children enrolling. The program was launched nationally in June 1993.}",
