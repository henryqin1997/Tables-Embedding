    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{22027=Re: #2 - This study is at the team level, so points per possession is all that matters. But if you're referring to the equation for estimating possessions, the variables in that formula were the only significant ones when it came to predicting a team's total number of possessions. Also, including steals and blocks as predictors would have been silly, since the whole point is to come up with an estimate we can use going back to 1951., 27546=Neil, I wasn't really happy with your answer but that could be because I don't understand it. That's fine. I'd much rather use statistics that we can trace each and every year. Since I wanted to, I decided I'd take data since the 2004-05 regular season and see what I came up with. Mind you, I don't know how to calculate percentages (odds of winning a title), but I did come up with a way to use FGM, FGA, TRB, AST, STL, BLK, TOV, and PTS., 11391=Boston's dominance during that stretch could possibly be inflating our sense of whether defensive teams are more likely to win because: A) Their defense was so historically outstanding in the Bill Russell era; and B) Their offense was so mediocre (they were below-average in 7 of the 13 years listed above!). To avoid the possibility of this skewing our sample, let's re-run the regression using only results since the 1976 ABA-NBA merger (and using the traditional possessions formula rather than the historical estimation):, 53686=5.8 / 5.0 = 1.16 0.6129486 / 0.5306148 =~ 1.1552 (about 1.16, if we round)., 37346=From 1961-69, they only ranked in the top half of the league in FG% once (1967). They were either last or second-to-last in the NBA 5 times. Those Celtics won because of their overwhelmingly dominant defense -- not their offense, which was actually below-average for the majority of that 11 titles-in-13 years run., 19670=This entry was posted on Friday, August 27th, 2010 at 10:39 am and is filed under Analysis, History, Playoffs, Statgeekery.

In 2006, both of the top two defensive teams made the Finals. In 2009, two of the top four teams made the Finals. In 2007 and 2010, there seemed to be an exception with one of the top five in the Finals in '07 and two of the top seven in '10., 40284=Here's how they worked: For each team, we know how many points they scored and allowed. We can estimate how many possessions they used by employing one of two equations -- either the standard post-1974 version that you see throughout the site, or the historical estimator I found back in June. The post-'74 version is obviously going to be much more accurate, but either way, you're going to come up with an estimate for the number of possessions the team used.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "From this equation, we would expect an average team during the Regular Season (0.0 on offense & defense) to have a 0.9% chance of winning an NBA title. If you increase offense to the following levels while keeping defense average, you see this pattern: p(C) ~ 1 / (1 + EXP(4.7267572 - (0.3988116 * Offense) + (0.612137 * Defense))) The first regression is between regular-season offensive/defensive rating (relative to the league average) and championships won since 1951, the first year for which I can estimate possessions.

    "textAfterTable": "Conversely, if you make the defense better while keeping the offense average, here are the expected championship probabilities: Offense Defense p(C) 0.0 0.0 0.9% 0.0 -1.0 1.6% 0.0 -2.0 2.9% 0.0 -3.0 5.3% 0.0 -4.0 9.3% 0.0 -5.0 15.9% 0.0 -6.0 25.8% 0.0 -7.0 39.1% 0.0 -8.0 54.2% 0.0 -9.0 68.6% 0.0 -10.0 80.1% As you can see, this result seems to bear out the old adage that \"Defense Wins Championships\"; for instance, to have the exact same title odds as a team with an average offense and a defense that was 5.0 pts/100 poss better than average, an average defensive team would have to score 7.7 more pts/100 poss than average! However, we're taking into account all of NBA history here (well, except for 1950), and in case you forgot, there was this ridiculous defensive dynasty in the late '50s & 1960s that probably skews the findings heavily toward defense...
