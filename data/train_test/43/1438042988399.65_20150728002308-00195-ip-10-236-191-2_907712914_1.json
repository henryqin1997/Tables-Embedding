The food has gotten more fast-foody this year, but it is still good and always something to eat, and for a 109 year old college, it is in pretty great shape. But could use a few repairs, and yes I know we have great plans coming about soon to be started to be renovated.",

Too bad that LMC does not a Graduate program yet., 47308=The campus is very old and was founded in 1900 by Edward Tuff. There js a Presbyterian church on campus with a grave yard so there are many ghost stories going around. Also, some of the dorms used to be part of a hospital so the rooms have not been changed much since it has been a hospital and there are ghost stories going around there. The most famous ghost story is about a 12 year old girl Emily that died around 1930's at the hospital of TB. She roams the campus but mainly fourth floor in Tate dorm. If you look for her tomb stone you won't find it because it moves. There is a tomb stone that looks like hers but that is of a 80 year old woman that died around the time she did. Many people get this grave confused for hers. A tradition that has been around the campus is Mountain Day. On Mountain Day, the school is closed for the day and everyone is to join a group to help clean up the campus. It's a mass service day and the school provides a great lunch with t-shirts. It's a nice way for everyone to get involved and just clean the beautiful campus., 41101=The service is spectacular but the food is still caf food, y'know? You can eat at the MacDonald Dining Hall (cafeteria), or you can eat at Wily's Cafe (diner). You only have limited Wily's money but you can check your caf card as many times during the day as you want (Fall 2013 and onward)., 84929=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

The school is very small so it is great for those who want to have a closer relationship with their peers and also their professors. Tips for prospective students If you aren't sure where you would like to go, make a campus visit. You never really understand the college until you visit the campus and get a feel for the atmosphere. Really try to do well on your SAT/ACT. There are so many scholarships out there for those who do well on the standardized tests. Bang for the buck Overall this is a great school. The academics are on point and the atmosphere is perfect. Sure, the",
