Richardson was named in Australia's squad for the Under-19 World Cup in 2010. He top scored in the final with 44, rescuing his team from a dicey situation and setting up the title march., 44969=From there Richardson has built up his domestic career handily, playing more limited overs and Twenty20 matches than Sheffield Shield fixtures, but impressing with his pace, aggression and a well-directed yorker, all of which were demonstrated in a return of 6 for 48 against Queensland in a domestic limited overs match early in the 2012-13 summer. After further strong showings during that season's Big Bash League, he was called into the national ODI squad to replace an injured Mitchell Starc during Australia's series against Sri Lanka in January 2013. His limited-overs performances were impressive enough for him to become one of the big buys of IPL 2013, when Pune Warriors bought him for US$700,000.
