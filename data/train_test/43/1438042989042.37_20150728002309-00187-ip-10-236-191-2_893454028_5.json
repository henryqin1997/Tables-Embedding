    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{14520=10/8/14: If one simply looks at the record and box scores, it would be easy to assume that the Rangers were simply an awful team in 2014. Of course, closer examination shows a much deeper issue - mainly an unprecedented onslaught of injuries to so many of their key players that it is impossible to distinguish the team that finished 2014 from the one that finished 2013. One of those injuries was to starting pitcher Colby Lewis, who shone in the 2011 World Series appearance year. Lewis has missed most of the last two years to injuries, and at 35, may not have too many options. But the Rangers would like to get him back and contract discussions have begun., 39580=5/2/12 - Two Texas Rangers players were awarded for their performances in the month of April. Outfielder Josh Hamilton was awarded the American League Player of the Month and Pitcher Yu Darvish was the American League Rookie of the Month. Hamilton led the league with 9 home runs, 25 RBIs, and was second in the league with a .395 batting average. In his first month in the Majors, Darvish was 4-0 in five starts. He also has a 2.18 ERA and 33 strikeouts in 33.0 innings pitched. It is the first time two Rangers teammates have won AL awards in the same month., 20793=7/17/14: It was not that long ago that the Rangers were the class on the American League and went to the World Series in consecutive years. The team had aspirations of contending in 2014, but injury after injury stopped those dreams. But the Rangers can look at the future with optimism. Prince Fielder will return next season, as will several others. The team has had a chance to play some developmental guys, which will help their growth into the Majors. And pitcher Yu Darvish is among the best in the league. While it may not be pretty this year, it is a good chance to know the next generation of Rangers' stars., 18885=8/7/14: The Texans are certainly not playing for this year. Quite frankly, the number and severity of major injuries the team has endured is almost unprecedented and even unfair. Teams that are more panic-driven may have reacted differently, but the Texans were smart during the trade deadline. They did not make any big trades to send off current or future talent. Instead, they held their ground and accepted that they will be a contending team next season when their key players return to injury. Fans may not like this approach, but it was the smart move and the Rangers should be well prepared in 2015., 38326=5/18/12 The Texas Rangers are riding the hot bat of Josh Hamilton, who has carried them to a 24-15 record thus far. Sitting in first place in the AL West, 4 games ahead of the Oakland Athletics, the Rangers will play a 3-game interleague set against their in-state pseudo-rivals the Houston Astros this weekend. Hamilton, who is leading the American League with a .399 batting average, also has 18 home runs and a jaw-dropping 45 RBI -- and we're barely halfway through May. Neftali Feliz, the Rangers' closer-turned-starter, will open up the series against the Astros from Minute Maid Park on Friday night., 6870=3/11/15: There is no way that this can happen two years in a row, is there? The Rangers 2014 season was ruined before it ever really got going due to a ridiculous amount of injuries to key players early in the season. That trend continued on throughout the year, and the Rangers ended up with one of the worst records in baseball. So far this spring training, they have lost second baseman Jurickson Profar to continued shoulder problems and now ace pitcher Yu Darvish is contemplating Tommy John surgery for a sprained UCL in his elbow. Surgery may be the only real option as there is a low success rate for rest and rehab working on this type of injury., 11941=12/3/14: Now that the Rangers have finished licking their wounds from the disastrous 2014 season, they really do have to focus on 2015. There is no reason not to believe that they cannot be a competitive force next season. They certainly have the talent on the roster - it just so happened that the entire roster (just about) got injured last season. They are trying to add a bit more talent and are reportedly interested in Kendrys Morales. Morales was mediocre last season, batting only .218 with eight homers in 98 games, but did tally 23 homers and 80 RBIs in 2013., 44915=Texas Rangers tickets allow fans to see if the club can make a return to the world series after winning the AL pennant in 2010. The Texas Rangers were established in 1961 and have been based in Arlington since 1972. They play at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington and have called it home since the park was opened in 1994. Watch as the Texas Rangers try to get back to the World Series in 2011!, 11341=1/7/15: This probably would have sounded like better news two years ago, but it still could pay off for the Rangers. The team re-signed starting pitcher Colby Lewis to a one-year deal for $4 million. Lewis was below average last season with a 5.18 ERA and lost 14 games. But there are some mitigating circumstances. He was coming off of an injury that cost him the 2013 season and the Rangers were a medical ward in 2014. Lewis was very good from 2010 to 2012. Perhaps being a year removed from his own injury and the improving health of the team will get him back to his 2012 form., 45714=Texas Rangers tickets ensure that fans see the Rangers playing top contenders throughout the entire MLB season. The Rangers are going to have the rest of the AL West gunning for them in 2011. With matchups with great teams like the Oakland Athletics and Los Angeles Angels and non-divisional meetings with the Boston Red Sox throughout the season, the Rangers have a great shot at taking the AL West again in 2011. Don't miss a second of the action!, 9425=1/28/15: The Texas Rangers should be a much better team in 2015 than in 2014, if for no other reason than they should be a lot healthier and will be able to put a major league roster on the field. But that does not mean that they are not trying to get better at any given position. One unlikely player to return to the Rangers is Josh Hamilton. Hamilton burned a lot of bridges, especially with the fans, when he fled to rival Anaheim for a monster deal two years ago. Since then, Hamilton has done very little. On top of that, he is owed over $90 million dollars, so Anaheim can keep him., 7543=3/4/15: The worst outcome for Jurickson Profar's 2015 season has come to be. He will miss his second straight season as he continues to recover from a shoulder injury. He missed 2014 in the hopes that rest and strengthening would be enough to get him back on the field. That did not work so now he will undergo season-ending surgery. The Rangers are rightfully disappointed, but GM Jon Daniels defended Profar's decision to rest last season. The good news is that Profar will only be 23 in 2016, plenty of time to still be a great player for the Rangers., 15199=10/1/14: You can breath easy now, Rangers fans. The nightmare that was the 2014 season is over. There are not many positives to take out of the season. It was marred from the start with major injuries to key players who ended up being shelved for the season. The big offseason acquisition, Prince Fielder, is a prime example. He was hurt in the beginning of the season and that was it. The Rangers traded Ian Kinsler for him, who ended up having a great season in Detroit. But we can now put the season to rest and take comfort in knowing that the Rangers will have a high draft spot and that several prospects got invaluable experience., 29491=10/2/12 Third Baseman Adrian Beltre of the Texas Rangers has been named the American League Player of the Month for September. Beltre last won the award in September of 2011. This September, Beltre hit .337 (33-98) with 11 home runs, and 19 runs scored in 26 games. He did it on both sides of the field, not committing an error in 22 games in September. Beltre also had four game- winning RBIs which was tops in the league during the month. For the season, he is hitting .321 with 36 home runs and 102 RBIs, all top 10 in the American League. He leads Texas into the Wild Card game against the Baltimore Orioles, where the winner will play the New York Yankees in the division series., 40158=4/30/12 - On January 18, the Texas Rangers signed Japanese pitcher Yu Darvish to a $60 Million dollar contract for six years. At the time, Darvish was considered the top pitcher in the Japanese professional baseball league and had impressed teams during the 2008 Beijing Olympics and 2009 World Baseball Classic. After a rocky first start in which he allowed 5 runs in 5 and 2/3 innings against the Seattle Mariners, Darvish has been fantastic. In the month of April, he is 4-0 with a 2.18 ERA in 5 starts. He has also struck out 33 batters in 33 innings pitched. After Darvish allowed five runs in the first two innings of his big league career, he has given up just three earned runs in 31 innings after that for an ERA of 0.87. The season is still a long way from being over, but for now the Texas Rangers investment is paying off as the Rangers are in first place in the west and have the best record in baseball with 17 wins and 6 losses., 43608=Another club with big expectations going into the 2012 season, the Texas Rangers added Japanese ace Yu Darvish to an already strong starting rotation in hopes of repeating at American League champions for the third straight year. The Rangers wasted no time getting out to a strong start by posting a 3-1 record through the first week. While Darvish struggled in his first start by giving up 5 earned runs in 5.2 innings, the team rallied from behind for an 11-5 win over the Mariners, giving Darvish his first win in as many tries. Slugger Josh Hamilton also added 2 home runs in the first week. 4/12/12 The two-time defending American League champion Texas Rangers are off to another hot start to begin 2012, with a 5-2 record, good enough for first place in the AL West. Although they lost their ace C.J. Wilson to free agency in the winter, they were able to acquire the hot-shot Japanese phenom Yu Darvish. Darvish made his MLB debut last week against the Seattle Mariners and was able to pick up the win, despite giving up 5 runs in the process. The Rangers hope to ride the hot bats of their power hitters like Josh Hamilton and Ian Kinsler and the pitching of starters Derek Holland and Neftali Feliz to another AL West title., 25760=5/22/14: It has been a tale of two months for Rangers' slugger Prince Fielder. April was historically brutal for him and he finished the month with a batting average barely over .200. May has been entirely different, and that is good for Texas. Fielder made an adjustment to hit the ball to the opposite field (to left field, since he is a left-handed batter) and it seems to be working. He is batting .386 in May. Often times, players go into slumps just because the season is so long, but Fielder seems to have figured something out and that may help the Rangers catch the division leaders later this season., 8779=2/11/15: It is a new dawn for baseball down in Texas. The Rangers had a miserable 2014 season when so many of their star players - who come with hefty price tags - went down with injury early in the season. The results were simply awful and capped off by manager Ron Washington stepping down for personal reasons. But this is a new year and the players are healing. Prince Fielder is excited about playing again and says he feels great after rehabbing from neck surgery last May. Expect the Tigers to be in the mix in the AL West, which is loaded with quality teams like the Los Angeles Angels, Seattle Mariners and Oakland A's., 36496=After tearing through the month of May, the Texas Rangers have now cooled down substantially, losing 7 of their last 10 games and dropping three consecutive series to the Mariners, Angels, and Athletics -- all division rivals. The Rangers are coming off of a rough series against Oakland where they lost three out of four games and will begin a three-game series against the San Francisco Giants on Friday night, a rematch of the 2010 World Series that the Giants won. Still leading the league in all four major offensive categories, the Rangers lead the Angels by 4 games in the AL West with a record of 33-25., 26388=5/15/14: For several years, infielder Jurickson Profar has been among the Rangers' top prospects - so good that the Rangers refused to move him even when they had the chance and other needs. Unfortunately, Profar just landed on the DL and will be out for several weeks. Same with Donnie Murphy. Texas' opening day second baseman, Josh Wilson, has been designated for assignment, leaving the Rangers' short in the middle of the infield. The team called up Roogie Odor to fill the holes until Profar returns, and to add a 'jolt' to the team. He is probably not the 2014 Yasiel Puig, but will be lauded if he can hold his own over the next few weeks., 45394=The Texas Rangers won the AL West in 2010. With 2010 AL MVP Josh Hamilton and slugger Nelson Cruz providing the offense, Rangers fans should bank on another great season in Arlington. Count on another solid season from these top performers., 16492=9/17/14: At some point in the future (possibly by mid-October) the Rangers will look back at 2014 as the \"Lost Season\". Texas has been out of the playoff picture since the beginning of the year, but so much of this had to do with injuries, rather that the play of the team. In a (hopefully) final blow, the team has shut down ace pitcher Yu Darvish for the season. Darvish has been a lone bright spot in a terrible season. It is probably the right call. Why expose him to injury when the season is lost already., 5694=3/25/15: The Texas Rangers simply suffered through 2014. An amazing rash of injuries that seemed more like a diabolical curse out of \"The Simpsons\" than a random stretch doomed last season. It has not been great this season either, especially after staff ace Yu Darvish went down for the year with Tommy John surgery. But the Rangers do have a good deal of talent on the team. They are reportedly talking with the Philadelphia Phillies about a trade for ace Cole Hamels, which would certainly soften the blow of losing Darvish - and may save their season., 41801=Already leading the American League West by a healthy 5.5 games going into the final game of April, the Texas Rangers will look to increase their lead when they head to Toronto to face off against the Blue Jays in a three game set this week. Josh Hamilton has not cooled down for the offense, now leading the team with a .395 batting average, 9 home runs and 25 runs batted in through only one month of the season. While it is prudent to believe that his batting average will drop a bit in the coming months, it is not out of the question to expect 45-50 home runs and 140 runs batted in from Hamilton if he can stay healthy for the rest of the season., 32215=Rangers Ballpark in Arlington is home to the Texas Rangers. The ballpark, located in Arlington, Texas, broke ground in 1992 and opened in 1994. The Texas Rangers play in the West Division of the American League. The Rangers have won the AL Pennant the last two seasons, but have failed to win a World Series, losing to the San Francisco Giants and the St. Louis Cardinals, respectively. Although the current capacity is 48,194 people, a Rangers Ballpark in Arlington record was set on October 30th, 2010 when 52,419 fans attended the third game in the 2010 World Series.In December of 2010, the Texas Rangers announced that many renovations would be made to Rangers Ballpark in Arlington in time for the 2011 season. The new additions included a new HD video board in right field and center field, an updated video board in left field, new production equipment and speakers for the audio system, and a new system which displays scores and videos, among other things.Rangers Ballpark in Arlington also includes a natural grass youth baseball park with a capacity of 650, a four story office building, and a 12 acre lake with parks and recreation space around it., 8115=2/25/15: Shouldn't all the injuries be over by now? Yes, 2014 was a train wreck with the absurd amount of Rangers starters missing most or all of the season with maladies of all sorts. But that season is in the rear view mirror and the Rangers are expected to be a pretty good team this season. Unfortunately, there is word that young infielder Jurickson Profar may miss 2015 as well. The former number one prospect was out last season with a shoulder injury and it seems that it has not healed properly. It looks like surgery for the budding star. The upside is that he is in his early 20's, so he still has many good years left in front of him., 13293=10/22/14: It is now officially time to forget that the 2014 season ever happened. Despite the miserable record, at least the Rangers will have one of the top picks in the MLB draft next season. Texas also announced the hiring of their new manager. It is Jeff Banister, who most recently was a bench coach for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Bannister has been in the Pirates organization since he was drafted in 1986. It is a bit of a surprise move, though. Interim manager Tim Bogar was the favorite, especially after he led the team to a 14-8 record when the team had nothing to play for in September., 42471=5/4/12 A red-hot 17-8 start to the season has the Texas Rangers sitting in first place in the AL West in the early part of this 2012 MLB season. Josh Hamilton is leading the charge for the Rangers, batting .395 with 9 home runs and 25 RBI. The Rangers have also been helped by their new phenom pitching acquistion Yu Darvish, who has made a few masterful starts for Texas so far this season. Darvish has been worth every penny so far, as he is 4-0 with a 2.18 ERA, a 1.42 WHIP and 33 strikeouts in five starts this season., 35259=The Texas Rangers, who got off to a slow start to the month of June after tearing through the better part of May, have gotten back on track again, winning 9 of their last 10 games and earning the top record in baseball along the way, thanks to the Dodgers' getting swept by the Athletics this week. The Rangers, at 43-27, are 5 games ahead of the second-place Los Angeles Angels, who have been making a push of their own lately. The Rangers' latest free agent pitching acquisition, Roy Oswalt, will make his first start of the season on Friday night in the first game of the series against the Colorado Rockies., 27607=5/1/14: Texas has played pretty well of late and caught up to the Oakland A's for first place in the American League West. While the A's continue to defy the odds with their use of sabermetrics and gritty play, the Rangers are expected to be near the top. That is a reasonable expectation considering the talent they have on the team. To help out, the team activated lefty Matt Harrison from the DL. Harrison has missed the last year with shoulder and back injuries. However, he was an all-star in 2012, the last season he was able to play., 10737=1/14/15: Just by showing up, the Texas Rangers should be better in 2015 than they were last year. The Rangers' season was pretty much over before it got started as just about every player they had of note seemed to suffer a serious injury. One of those players was youngster Jurickson Profar, one of the top prospects in all of professional baseball. He tore a major shoulder muscle in spring training last year and missed the entire season. He is not ready to return to the majors, but is set to begin a throwing program soon, and will hopefully get back up to speed over a few months.}",
