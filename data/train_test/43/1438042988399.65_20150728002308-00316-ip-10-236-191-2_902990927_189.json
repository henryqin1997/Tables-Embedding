            "It starts out tasting alright, but after a while, it gets old. This is the same for any dorm food. If you want better food, eat at Arnold Dining or West.",
            "Some dorms are better than others in terms of the physical rooms. You will meet some of your best college friends in your dorm, but be sure to branch out as well.",
            "Many classes can be very difficult. As long as you keep up the studying and do the homework, you should be fine. Try your hardest but be sure to throw some fun in every now and then.",
            "Be sure to keep up with your studying, even when spring comes around. Make an effort to make friends who live in other dorms.",
            "Great for engineering or science focused students. The social life is wonderful outside of the classroom. I have loved my experience here."

Food options aren't all that great, but food from the dining halls are relatively cheap and taste good.

You also must be able to manage your time because no one else will do this for you. Being a science student I would suggest looking at the school if you are interested in the science or business area. Tips for prospective students The amount you learn in a class depends on many different factors. In the first year you really have to learn how to juggle a whole new array of things that can become quite overwhelming. OSU offers some helpful classes on time juggling, study sessions, and other recourses which should be taken advantage of. Teachers can also play a large role in how much you learn throughout your college experience. Check out www.ratemyprofessors.com for some reviews by people who have",
