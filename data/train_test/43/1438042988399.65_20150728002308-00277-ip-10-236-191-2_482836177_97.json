The Cat In The Hat's unique identifier is 0123456789.00.00 and the unique identifier of The Fat Cat is 0123456789.02.00. By matching all unique identifiers with the same XXXXXXXXXX values, these identifiers allow us to determine that The Fat Cat is contained by The Cat In The Hat. Since The Cat In The Hat contained a 1 for the first query, The Fat Cat's and Tee Totaler hit mask are changed to values of 11 and 10, respectively. The following two phase process can be employed to obtain this result., 685041=SECTION:0130808598.11.03.00, 685330=CHAPTER.C:013254749X.02.00.00, 605495=Once the data is loaded into these index classes, it can be queried by the add and delete functions. Each time the add and delete functions need to determine the applicable rules, a query is made to the PreReq index class. A sample query which searches for those rules applicable to a section, 0562423452.03.02.00, is shown below., 679976=CHAPTER.C:0130808598.03.00.00, 633028=For each relation defined in the PSF files, a row is added to the Rights index class. For each exclusion within the relation, a row is added to the Rights Aux index class. All the exclusions for a relation are ordered prior to loading into these index classes. The unique identifier of the first exclusion's row is placed into the AuxItem column of the relation's AuxItem column within the Rights index class. The SiblingItem column of each exclusion contains the unique identifier of the next exclusion within a relation. The last exclusion for a relation contains nothing in the SiblingItem field. Once the data is loaded into these index classes, it can be queried by the add function. Each time the add function needs to determine the applicable rules, a query is made to the Rights index class. A sample query which searches for those rules applicable to a section, 0562423452.03.02.00, is shown below., 681185=SECTION:0130808598.03.05.00, 678212=SECTION:0130131490.02.04.00, 681545=SECTION:0130808598.03.06.00, 683911=SECTION:0130808598.07.03.00, 679724=SECTION:0130808598.02.06.00, 680835=SECTION:0130808598.03.04.00, 685819=SECTION:013254749X.02.04.00, 680234=SECTION:0130808598.03.02.00, 686080=CHAPTER.C:013254749X.05.00.00, 616467=Suppose a Section 3 has an ISBN number is 0234567891.01.03.00 and a Section 2 has an ISBN number is 0343434343.02.02.00. Both sections have been selected for addition to a CBO. The following grid defines two sample rules. The first rule states to not permit pre-published content, Section 3, to be added to a CBO containing pre-published content, Section 2, for a program, Business Economics. The second rule states to not permit pre-published content, Section 2A, to be added to a CBO containing Section 3C, for the program, Freshmen Engineering., 677956=CHAPTER.C, 0130131490.02.00.00, 684198=CHAPTER.C, 0130808598.10.00.00, 681842=SECTION:0130808598.04.03.00, 677715=SECTION: 013011037X.10.03.00, 685576=SECTION:013254749X.02.03.00, 50884=Appendix A to this application is set forth on a single compact disc and the material recorded thereon is incorporated by reference herein. The following file is recorded on the compact disc: file name: AppendixA.txt; file size: 107 kB; date of creation: May 16, 2002., 678725=SECTION:0130808598.02.02.00, 386591=Application layer 28 and API layer 30 interoperate to execute a group of functions defined to enable creation, submission and request processing of a CBO. The functions are listed below and described subsequently with reference to specific CBO tasks. Each function is a logical procedure, preferably implemented in C++, that defines a set of function rules and includes calls to digital library functions necessary to perform the function (e.g. Queries, writes, etc.). In other words, each function is an encapsulation of a series of oft-repeated functional steps which facilitates the creation and processing of a CBO. Digital library function calls are made through the digital library Client OO API 42. A definition of digital library 20 OO API function calls utilized by API layer 30 is provided in the \u201cIBM Digital Library Programming Reference Version 2\u201d, Second Edition (September 1997), and rules for making these function calls are provided in the \u201cIBM Digital Library Guide to Object-Oriented and Internet Application Programming Version 2\u201d, Second Edition (September 1997), both available from IBM Corporation., 678975=SECTION:0130808598.02.03.00, 673169=The OO API 42 receives this input, then sends the text search to Text Miner through the TextMiner API, and the parametric search to the digital library. The TextMiner API and indexing requirements are described in the Digital Library Text Search Using TextMiner Application Programming Reference, First Edition (September 1997) available from IBM Corporation., 582429=A rule collision exists in the preceding table for the program business economics between the dates of May 1999 and September 1999. During this time, rules 3-6 do not apply. However, rules 1 and 2 do apply since they do not have a defined start and termination time period. The result is that Cases B and C are prerequisites at all times (even between May 1999 and September 1999). Prior to May 1999, rules 3 and 4 are exercised. Between May 1999 and September 1999, rules 1 and 2 are exercised and after September 1999 rules 5 and 6 are used. The effect desired is for no rules to be exercised between May 1999 and September 1999. This can be accomplished by removing rules 1 and 2. At the present time, this problem has a low likelihood of occurring and is thus left to the system administrator to manage. The system administrator is informed this is an erroneous situation and is requested to remove rules 1 and 2., 682138=SECTION:0130808598.05.04.00, 683272=SECTION:0130808598.06.03.00, 680574=SECTION:0130808598.03.03.00, 48402=This application is related to the co-pending and commonly assigned patent applications listed below, which were filed herewith on Jan. 21, 2000 and are all incorporated by reference herein:, 678474=CHAPTER.C, 0130808598.02.00.00, 686311=SECTION:013254749X.10.02.00, 682732=CHAPTER.C, 0130808598.06.00.00, 683006=SECTION:0130808598.06.02.00, 588518=Suppose Section 3's ISBN number is 0234567891.01.03.00 and Section 2's ISBN number is 0343434343.02.02.00. The following grid defines two sample rules. The following PSF/ATR file format represents these two rules., 565308=In the business rule represented by row 1, the requiring resource is Section 3 of a prepublished book and requires section two. Since the \u201cProgram Restriction\u201d and \u201cPrograms to Include or Exclude\u201d columns are marked \u201cN/A\u201d, this rule is to be applied to all programs. In addition, it is to be applied all the time since no start and end dates are specified. The business rule in row 4 also pertains to Section 3. The rules of rows 1 and four are similar with the exception of the applicable time period. In this situation, section 2 is included prior to May 1999 and after September 1999. Thus, rules can be combined to form more complicated rules relationships., 679225=SECTION:0130808598.02.04.00, 683564=SECTION:0130808598.06.08.00}",
