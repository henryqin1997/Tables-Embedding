            "It's like with any other university - there's going to be thefts and whatnot, but the campus police are always patrolling not just immediately around campus but off it by a bit too. And you can always call them to walk you to your car at night to make sure you'll be fine.",
            "I'm not personally part of a sorority/fraternity but they seem to have a lot of fun..",
            "There are A LOT of student organizations on campus, and it's easy to get involved and be an active member of any of them. Just start going to a meeting, participate in serious and fun activities, be a board member, it's all easily doable. Just go for it!",
            "The mascot is a green barney... Not sure how they came up with that, it's a mystery to anybody you ask.",
            "They keep raising the tuition.. I know the economy is bad, but not just for the university, but for students as well. It's getting harder and harder to pay and it doesn't feel like it's worth it. At all. There are so many classes where you can see that the profs are there just because it's part of the job but they actually want to do their research and so you don't get the best learning experience you should from all that money you're paying towards your education.",
            "The student center has an area dedicated for fun activities in the basement. I haven't been down there for a very long time though, so unfortunately I cannot tell you what's there.",
            "There are quite a few places to eat on or around campus, but you do get bored of the food after a while, despite the variety. There's Jimmy Johns, Starbucks, Einsteins, Tim Hortons, Campus Diner, Byblos, Blimpies, La Pita, McDonalds, Pizza Hut, Subway, Taco Bell, KFC (these are directly on campus). If you leave campus and go to the downtown area of even just go to a Dearborn (mere 10 mins away) you get a lot more variety.",
            "I can't actually provide an accurate assessment of dorm life because I never lived on campus, but I hear it's nice.",
            "ESP is probably the best program in 'academic rigor' at Wayne where all the profs involved truly care about their students.",
            "If you're taking a math class, participate in ESP (Emerging Scholars Program) which is DEDICATED to making sure their students learn the material and do great in their math classes - even those who are horrible or terrified of math come out having learned the material and gaining a great support network!",
            "They definitely have great events for enticing new students to the University by providing welcoming events and activities for them to participate it. It makes it all very exciting and helps decrease some stress or anxiety one might feel about attending a new university. Also, these events are designed to get new students interacting with current students, so it helps get them more comfortable when they are immediately able to start building up their network."

Overall I have been blessed to receive the OMLP Award for most of my time in the program. This is awarded by GM and gives you $500-$2000 toward tuition as long as your academic scores are maintained., 733193=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 174926=There are many organizations for students of all ethnic backgrounds. They have a day in September when all of the different clubs display and share their traditions and cultures., 140714=At Wayne State University, there are a few fun things that you can become accustomed to like the large rock in the center of campus where different groups spray paint their advertisement on them. Many of the groups that advertise their events are the sororities and fraternities, but some of the other events come from the groups of students from different majors of different interests. On campus, there are also a few hang-outs like on the second floor of the Undergraduate Library or the Student Center. Another thing that WSU is known for providing are the events where students can be shuttled on our own bus system to different cultural areas of Detroit where they can learn different types of dances, eat at a new restaurant, walk around the open fresh food market, attend a professional sports game, hear a Tchaikovsky concert from a full orchestra, or attend a concert from someone like Bruno Mars who performed on campus in 2011., 136272=One of the largest things that people look for in their campus and one of the largest things that would surprise people about Wayne State University are their Safety systems. Our WSU Police Department was formed in 1966 and each officer is fully licensed through the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards And they are seen all over campus and in the surrounding areas in patrol cars, on bikes, on foot and with K-9 units. Along with that, the students becoming Police Officers at Wayne State also patrol the entire campus and through every building in uniform providing an extra watch. Our parking structures especially, are fully protected by surveillance and guards. And access to almost every location requires a photo ID WSU card where each one has only a specific security level, with fewer being able to get into some buildings based on necessity like dorms, and fewer still for areas where valuables are stored like each dorm room or offices or music and art rooms. Beyond that, we employ a blue light system with individual telefone devices with a blue flashing light on top that turn on with the simple press of a button from anyone in trouble on campus. There are over 300 units and it is guaranteed that a WSU Police Officer can be at any location in under 90 seconds. Additionally, our WSU P.O. Headquarters can be contacted on or just off campus so that you can be escorted by an officer to where you are going, like a parking structure later at night., 59749=I lived on campus in DeRoy apartments in the Winter of 2011. I liked being able to go to class and have time to go back to my apartment in between classes. Most people commute to Wayne, but I personally like living there. The campus dorms require you to have a meal plan. If you live in the campus apartments, then meal plans are optional. I choose to make my own food, but having the option is nice.}",
