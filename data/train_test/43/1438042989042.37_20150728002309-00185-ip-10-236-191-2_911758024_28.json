            "The campus is, for the most part,rather safe.",
            "Sports clubs at Oberlin are very weak. I assume most of the best athletes simply go to Ohio state, and the remainders go to Oberlin. No major activities during the year unless you are a big fan of classical music - in which case there are fairly frequent performances by reputable names. No other major concerts anywhere near the college.",

            "This is one of the most expensive colleges in the country, but it is difficult to understand why this is so. I personally am very discontent with the college considering the cost.",
            "The 'Sco' is bar/ dancehall/ concert hall. It's the central social point on campus. Theater and classical music productions occur fairly regularly during the semester. You otherwise create your own fun with your peers.",
            "Meal plans are very expensive and do not roll over so you have to use all your weekly meals or else you lose them. Students are required to sign up for a meal plan so you won't be able to simply pay as you eat. Some days are better than other but as a whole the meals are nothing special taste-wise and variety is somewhat lacking. The dining halls actually shut down over the breaks even with students remaining on campus, so even though you're paying that much for food, you'll have to fend for yourself over the breaks. This will be difficult if you're a low income students as grocery shopping isn't very cheap in town. There are 3 dining halls on campus. During lunch hours seating can be difficult to find and lines are rather long. You can also choose to dine at a co-op as an alternative. These are run by students who work together to make their own meals.",
            "Some dorms are much better than others. Most dorms are very basic and there is often inadequate heating during the winter and no cooling systems during the summer. Getting into one of the better dorms is very difficult.",
            "Requirements for graduation are a bit much and will require you to do quite a bit of work outside your major and probably outside your comfort zone.",
            "- Meal plans don't roll over - No public transportation - Dining halls close during breaks - 2 semesters + a 1 month 'Winter Term' per year",
            "Small, liberal arts college at the center of a small town. Very expensive but not really worth the cost. Very strong conservatory."

The commitment to the student is extremely clear. My private teacher gives above and beyond the requirements for his students with additional lessons each semester, and a technique class for each freshman. In addition, the guest lecturers and artists giving concerts are educationally and financially worth an incredible price. Oberlin Conservatory has more Steinway pianos than anywhere in the world excluding the Steinway factory. This speaks to the type of equipment and resources with which the students work. The Conservatory Library never ceases to amaze me with the unreal amount of resources it provides. In addition to this, the orchestra tours and experiences are included in tuition. This year's tour to NYC in January is of no cost to the students participating. Oberlin provides a plethora of resources, highly renown faculty and guests, and will bend over backwards to provide what you need for your learning experience. Although Oberlin's tuition is extraordinarily high, this price reflects the incredible experiences and opportunities that await its students.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot The range of what you can learn here is vast. I'm currently kicking it with the true liberal arts experience taking cinema classes, photography, computer programming, Literature courses, and still being able to find incredible opportunities to volunteer. Classes are small, so its easy to develop relationships with your professors and take much more from a class than you might on another campus.

Reviewer has been to campus. 11 out of 20 people found this review useful. 3 of 29 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Oberlin is great for people who are hard workers, intelligent, creative, and out-of-the-box thinkers. The music program, which is what I'm attending, is excellent and I feel greatly motivated to practice and feel encouraged by my teachers and peers. Login to rate or flag the reviews",
