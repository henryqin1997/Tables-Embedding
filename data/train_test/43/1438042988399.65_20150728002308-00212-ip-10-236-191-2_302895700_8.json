I am certainly happy with our performance which is a huge step forward, considering where we were in qualifying here last year. I can only thank the guys for all of the hard work that they have achieved over the winter. I also think it is important to stress that Mercedes-Benz have always believed in and supported this project, and I really hope we can deliver the results we all want. We have to take this step-by-step as the competition is very tight, so now we have to continue to work hard.\" MARK WEBBER, Position: 5th, (3rd Practice \u2013 P3, 1:25.900) \u201cWe knew there were some quick guys out there - McLaren and Mercedes especially and Roman did well too. Everyone always thinks we have special bits to keep coming back, but this year it\u2019s opened right up. I didn\u2019t have KERS at the end of the session, which affects your rhythm during qualifying \u2013 it\u2019s a shame as it\u2019s been faultless all winter. I\u2019m pleased with my lap in Q3. We can still get on the podium tomorrow, but we have some fast cars around us, no question about it.\u201d, 14544=In much bigger strife is fabled Ferrari, with neither F2012 making it through to Q3., 18488=SEBASTIAN VETTEL, Position: 6th, (3rd Practice \u2013 P7, 1:26.211) \u201cIt\u2019s the first qualifying of the year, so it\u2019s always difficult to know what to expect, but I think what we saw today was not a surprise, the lap times were close. We would have loved to have been closer to the front, but in Q3 I wasn\u2019t happy with my lap. I made a mistake at the beginning and lost some time, so that was down to me. I could have been one or two places higher, but that\u2019s how it goes. We are not starting at the front, but we are not starting at the back either, so it\u2019s far from disastrous and regarding the car we know what we need to do. We have a long race ahead of us tomorrow and a lot of opportunities, so I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d}",

Everyone has worked so hard to get us to a good position for qualifying and the race, and I would like to thank the whole team for their support, which has been incredible. We haven\u2019t had the best preparation and there is more to come that we don\u2019t even know about yet. I\u2019m happy for today and for the team. Tomorrow is another day and I have to keep pushing hard for the race. I am very excited but I want to stay focused and leave the weekend knowing I got everything I could ask from myself in my first race.\u201d Bruno Senna: It\u2019s a bit of a lottery when you go into qualifying without having had a full day of running on Friday, but the car feels good. Pastor qualified in the top 10 which is a really good sign for the team. I wasn\u2019t particularly happy with my lap, but it\u2019s the first qualifying session of the year. We have 19 more to go, and I am sure with a little more experience, everything will come together. Tomorrow is a different day, so we will see what we can do.
