            "The school is very SAFE! you see and security guard at every main entrance. To go into the architecture school, you have to enter with a student id and a security guard it always at the door.",
            "There are a couple of sororities and fraternities, but it isnt a big thing at my school",
            "Many clubs are with with major you are. Architecture school has like 3 clubs...AIAS, Latin Pratt, and a club for architecture asian students",
            "You will find many personalities artsy, focused, students that like to spend it well. There is great diversity in the school just as you will find in the city itself. Many languages are spoken, and there are many backgrounds, with that, great discussions emerge.",
            "Gold cannon and blow whistles. Have you heard of the Pratt Cats? Look it up.",
            "What can't you do, when you are in NYC. You'll fall in love with thecity and school at the same time.",
            "There are a lot of hole in the wall places around the area, spend it there and not on the expensive food from Pratt.",
            "It becomes a community, and your friends will come from people that live in your dorm. Willoughby Hall is awesome because Pratt literally bought a public housing building and made them dorms. You have a health clinic, mini grocery all in the same building.",
            "Architecture is the most rigorous! Intense classes, no sleep, and you run only on coffee for days during finals. If you have passion, you will make it through.",
            "This is an art school, if you get in, you are talented. Don't doubt your skills and creativity, just work hard and get you degree. It is only a couple of years of this and I know Pratt and NYC will not let you down. You have many opportunities coming from this school. Just remember, you are only as good as what you put into it. With hard work and challenging yourself, you will learn so much.",
            "This school is artsy, small, and intense. Architecture School works you hard, but you get a lot out of it. The school is located in Brooklyn, far enough to concentrate on school, close enough to the best city in the world."

You pay for every item instead of just swiping per time you go into cafeteria like most colleges. As a freshman you must get a meal plan, your options are 1600 or 1800 dollars per semester. If you don't finish your money you can use some of those points at the convenience store on campus or at one of their Starbucks cafes. The food is about standard for a college campus.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here There are long nights and you're often working much after normal people would go to sleep. But that's how it is with an art school, and it's nice to know that almost everyone is doing the same. It keeps the competition healthy and your work good. Am learning a lot I transfered here at the beginning of my junior year from their upstate campus in Utica NY, PRATTMWP. I am a currently a junior in the Communications Design department, Major : Graphic Design. I find that the teachers at the main institute in Brooklyn are fantastic. A lot of them are very successful in the fields they are teaching. It's good to know because they have real world experience and can help you understand what it is actually like and what to expect after college.
