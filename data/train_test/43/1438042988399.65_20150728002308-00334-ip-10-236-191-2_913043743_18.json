            "No real issues with campus safety! Relatively safe area.",
            "Greek life is a comparatively small part of campus. I believe around fifteen percent of the campus is a part of Greek life, but I could be wrong.",
            "Many, many clubs and activities.",
            "Liberals, social-justice types, those conscientious about the environment, those who are not looking for a party school.",
            "We have a tradition of throwing the birthday boy/girl into our school's fountain on their birthday.",
            "Prohibitively expensive. I'm having an absolutely wonderful time, though.",
            "There aren't big party scenes, but you can find them if you look for them. Activities in Los Angeles are often planned on the weekends, but it's easy to feel cooped up and bored if you don't keep busy with extracurriculars or friends. Fortunately, there are plenty of both.",
            "Great food! Different selections every day that generally do not disappoint. Meal plan costs are a little high and sometimes go unspent, however. Dining options tend to get a little sparse on weekends.",
            "Each residential hall seems to have a distinctive theme; I am very fond of my residential hall, which is filled with wonderful and friendly people.",
            "As with most colleges and universities, academic rigor rests on the classes you take. Bad at science? Take an easier science course.",
            "Occidental College tends to place an emphasis on the story you can bring to the student body, as opposed to purely academics. Put some personality into your application!",
            "The environment is strongly liberal and a little too stringent when it comes to political correctness. That being said, it is also a very supportive environment in which individuals like myself can push themselves to become who they want to be. This is a school that cares about diversity, the environment, and equality."

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot I am a Biology major and I am entering my last year at Occidental, or Oxy, as many call it. The knowledgeable professors and small class size really make the difference. I have gained hands-on experience in laboratories and undergraduate research, which is possible here because of the size of the student body. There is always someone available if you have a question or just want to get to know a professor more. Occidental has several programs to help students build and expand their learning. The Summer Research Program lasts 8 weeks and sponsors students with research proposals from all majors. There are weekly seminars and meetings that introduce students to potential careers and global events. Each major usually has department-specific talks that cater to students and possible careers that they may be interested in. Oxy has academic support, including tutoring in many subjects, student-led study groups, and professional staff that can help you with essay organization and improvement. Be aware of all these resources as a student as they are very beneficial!
