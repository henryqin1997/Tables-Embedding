The earlier your application is in and you make your deposit, the more housing options you have. If you qualify for honors or are interested in service, you can live on the honors or Ignatian floors. These two floors are in the freshman hall that was built in 2008. They are modern and very spacious. Another benefit is that they are air-conditioned. Another tip is if you have taken college classes in high school, send them to the college to see if they transfer. The more core requirements you can get out of the way, the faster you can start working on the classes that really count towards your major.}",

Also, the two classes I took so far in this department have both being very engaging. Tips for prospective students If you can, I'd suggest getting into a two year school to cover all the basics for less then applying here. The Jesuits schools are suppose to be very good as a name to get jobs with, but as this is only student hearsay, take it with caution. Bang for the buck Not initially showing it's worth unless you can get most of it paid for. The higher classes may prove to make all of this worth it but the starting classes are sub-par in my opinion.",
