(For those unfamiliar, this is short for \u201celectronic penis\u201d, and tends to be used to suggest someone is egotistically willy-waving.) However, he did not even introduce the word. It was in reply to someone else who\u2019d said it, and responded, \u201cAh, back to the e-peen talk.\u201d He was originally told this ban would be for 72 hours, but on Saturday received an email informing him that it was now to be a permanent ban from his Origin account, with no further explanation given. It was added that the matter was \u201cnow closed\u201d. And, as ever, EA\u2019s live chat and customer support are refusing to help him in any way. He\u2019s also been told that his BF3 characters and levels will be deleted. who explained it was an error. Now they tell the tale of a few different similar incidents indicating the same policy is still being enforced. The story has an update showing EA's email response to a user explaining his \"account will no longer be accessible in any way, and all property, items, and characters associated currently are or will soon be deleted,\" and they have reached out to EA for a further explanation. Here's their description of how he earned the ban: Dragon Age II after being banned for misconduct",
