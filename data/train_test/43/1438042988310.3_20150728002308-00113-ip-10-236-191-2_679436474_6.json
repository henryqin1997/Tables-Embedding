He should begin 2009 in Double-A, which will challenge his still-questionable plate discipline, but he has a chance to progress through the minors and be up with the Phillies by as early as 2010 if he can solve the few issues that he\ufffds dealt with. He has great tools and athleticism that provide for nice upside down the road., 40873=Age is determined on July 1st of each season. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jump To:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25b2 Basic Stats \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25b2 Split Stats \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25b2 Games By Position, 52378=Taylor's 2010 season ranks among the most disappointing seasons in the minors for an upper-level prospect, as he hit just .272 with a scant six homers in 127 games at Triple-A Sacramento after a promising season in the Phillies' system in 2009. The A's added three outfield/DH bats in the winter (David DeJesus, Josh Willingham and Hideki Matsui), all but assuring Taylor another year at Triple-A Sacramento unless he pounds the cover off the ball in spring training., 52894=2010, 50652=2015, 45904=9/3/2014, 48790=3/29/2014, 51556=Taylor rebounded from a terrible 2010 (six homers in 464 at-bats) with a decent 2011 showing at Triple-A Sacramento (.272/.360/.456, 16 homers, 14 steals in 349 at-bats). Hampered by a wrist injury to start the season, Taylor was still prone to slumps (.243/.331/.364 in 107 at-bats in August) before being called up in September by the A's. Oakland general manager Billy Beane indicated he'd like to see a \"dominating\" performance from Taylor at Triple-A Sacramento before he is handed a job in the A's outfield, so Taylor could find himself back in the minors to start the season despite virtually no competition for a spot in a turned over A's outfield. A great spring would likely accelerate that timetable., 47872=4/3/2014, 52946=Taylor established himself as a top prospect this past season with a great year at Double-A Reading where he hit .333/.408/.569 with 22 doubles, 15 home runs and 18 stolen bases. He was moved up to Triple-A in mid-July and continued his solid play before missing some time at the end of the season with a strained oblique. After he was traded to Oakland from Philadelphia in the Roy Halladay/Cliff Lee four-team blockbuster, Taylor has a much clearer path to everyday at-bats in the big leagues and there's a good chance he'll be given a shot to earn a starting role with the A's during spring training., 19849=Age is determined on July 1st of each season. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jump To:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25bc Advanced Stats \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25bc Games By Position, 42138=10/24/2014, 50704=Subscribe now to see our 2015 outlook., 44959=9/22/2014, 52326=2011, 50877=Taylor continues to be an enigma for the A's, as every time he gets called up the majors, he looks horrible, even though his opportunities have been very brief. He now owns a brutal .135 batting average over 74 major league at-bats, and he looks lost every time he gets a chance in Oakland. Taylor hit 18 homers to go along with a .281 batting average at Triple-A Sacramento in 2013, so he still has some offensive potential. It could be that Taylor just needs a longer look with consistent at-bats, but given Oakland's depth in the outfield, he is unlikely to get that in 2014., 44073=9/26/2014, 49685=3/27/2014, 51504=2012, 46927=6/14/2014}",
