    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{32107=2/27/14: Some players look back fondly on times when they were with other teams, and some are just happy the time is over. Relief pitcher Heath Bell seems happy that his time in the desert is over and that he is now pitching for the Tampa Bay Rays. Bell had a good career going in San Diego as a closer then went to the Marlins. He struggled, but then again, so did the Marlins. He was traded to the D'Backs after the 2012 season and did not fare any better with Arizona. He was pulled from the closer role and finished with an ERA over 4.0 in just 65.7 innings. Arizona traded him to the Rays and Bell maintains that his style just did not work with the D'Backs style. That happens at times and it was probably best that both sides move on., 14520=9/24/14: The Diamondbacks are in shut down mode at this point in the season. As much as the great die-hard fans of the organization hate to see it, it is probably for the best. The team ended pitcher Oliver Perez' season last week. He had been suffering from the dreaded 'dead arm' which affects even the best of pitchers late in many seasons. Perez was actually pretty good this season, but it will do the team more good to let him rest and get ready for 2015 rather than fight through an arm issue and possibly hurt himself even more., 53293=7/4/13: There has been a lot of talk show chatter about the Dodgers this week, mostly that they can still win the division. Not many teams in last place at the half way mark win the division, though the Dodgers are only 8.5 games back and are getting healthier. That means nothing to the Diamondbacks. From top to bottom, Arizona is the best managed and talented team. They may not have a $230 million payroll - rather they did it the right way. Come October, the D'backs will likely be still playing, while the rest of the NL West is wondering how they did that., 45286=10/3/13: The Arizona Diamondbacks finished out the 2013 regular season with a win over the Washington Nationals. That was good, and it got the team to 81-81 on the season. However, it was not nearly good enough to make it to the postseason, so it is now time to get the golf clubs out. Several question remain, such as if Kirk Gibson will remain as manager of if the team will find someone else for next year. One thing that is certain is that the Dodgers have asserted themselves as the class of the NL West, so every other team, including Arizona, must get busy in the offseason to compete next year., 29595=3/27/14: The Arizona Diamondbacks, along with the rival Los Angeles Dodgers, kicked off the 2014 Major League Baseball regular season with a two game series in Sydney, Australia last weekend. While the rest of MLB is back in Arizona or Florida for spring training, these two teams met in an attempt to grow the game internationally. It was a rough weekend for Arizona. Ignoring the roughly 50 hours of travel roundtrip, the D'Backs dropped both games. Dodgers' ace Clayton Kershaw overpowered the Arizona lineup in game one. The Diamondbacks made a nice late effort to rally in the ninth inning of game two, but came up short, losing 7-6., 24092=5/29/14: Tony LaRussa is back in the big leagues. The Arizona Diamondbacks hired LaRussa to take control of their baseball operations and turn the team around. LaRussa is among the winningest managers of all time, having last been in uniform as the skipper of the St. Louis Cardinals for their magical 2011 World Series title. Of course, the first team the D'backs faced after hiring LaRussa was the Cardinals, who swept Arizona. Cards' pitcher Adam Wainwright threw one of the best games of his career, facing only 28 batters and allowing only one hit in a complete game shutout., 46525=9/19/13: Though they are not mathematically eliminated from the wildcard spot, time is running out and the Diamondbacks are not playing their best ball of the season. That is a recipe for looking ahead to next year. And that could be interesting because the D'backs have arguably the best pitching prospect in the majors with Archie Bradley. Bradley, the number 7 overall pick in the 2011 draft, has taken advantage of his time in the minors to develop into a pitcher that some are comparing to Justin Verlander. No one expects him to be that good right away, but it is a great counter to the Dodgers in the NL West for the future., 43398=10/24/13: It is not too early to start looking forward to 2014, and that means getting excited about rookies that have never or just barely played at the major league level. For Arizona, that means 22 year old shortstop Chris Owings. Owings has been stuck at AAA Reno for the past couple of years but was called up late this season. In 17 games, he sported a respectable .295/.380/.386 line that included two stolen bases and four doubles. He is a good defender that can hit, which makes him a better bet than incumbent Didi Gregorious. That being said, Gregoroious is a tremendous artist, literally, as shown by his Batman versus Kane rendering., 15786=8/28/14: There are a lot of conflicting reports coming out of the desert in recent days, and they all involve the future of manager Kirk Gibson. Initial reports said that Gibson's job was safe for next season, which would be pretty odd considering the team's performance this season. More recent reports quote new boss Tony LaRussa as saying that he is not guaranteed a job in 2015. That would seem to make more sense. The D'backs have a long way to go in rebuilding their organization - not just at the MLB level but also at the developmental level. LaRussa helped build the St. Louis Cardinals into an annual contender, so it may be wise to listen to him., 63916=2013 National League West Tickets NL West Standings MLB Opening Day News - National League West MLB 2013 Preview - The NL West The National League West was competitive right until the wire in 2012, and that test proved to benefit the division champ and eventual World Series winning San Francisco Giants. The Giants were\u2026, 23490=6/6/14: Another week and another round of bad news for the Diamondbacks. Left fielder Mark Trumbo fractured his foot in April and was expected to miss six weeks. That timeframe was a bit too optimistic as the D'backs are targeting the third week in June for his return. Trumbo's rehab seemed to be going well at the outset, but to date, he is only hitting balls off of a tee. Trumbo was expected to provide power for the team after acquiring him from the Angels. While this is not manager Kirk Gibson's fault, one can only wonder how long new boss Tony LaRussa will stick with Gibson., 62693=The Arizona Diamondbacks are definitely a team undergoing a transition. After a disappointing finish in 2010 the Diamondbacks come into the 2011 campaign with new GM Kevin Towers. Towers plans on centering his focus on a strong rotation led by Daniel Hudson and Ian Kennedy, as well as solid position play., 16461=8/21/14: The Giants have had a nice bounce back season after being completely depressing in 2013. The pitching and hitting have returned and the team has battled the Dodgers admirably throughout the year. At this point, however, it looks like the Dodgers' deep pockets are winning the race for the NL West, leaving the Giants to scramble for a wild card spot. The addition of the second wild card spot has made the National League race very interesting. The Giants are battling teams like Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Atlanta, and even Miami for the right to get into a one game playoff to get into the real playoffs. If nothing else, it should be fascinating to watch them jockey for position over the next five weeks., 62099=Arizona Diamondbacks tickets allow fans the opportunity to see one of baseball's youngest franchises play their way into the history books. The Diamondbacks, established as an expansion team in 1998, amazingly have already won one World Series championships and NL pennants during their short existence. The club is the fastest expansion team in the majors to have ever won a series. The D-backs play at Chase Field in downtown Phoenix. Grab some Diamondbacks tickets and enjoy a game this season!, 36661=1/9/14: Relief pitcher J.J. Putz had a decent 2013 with a 2.36 ERA in 34 innings of work, and that is generally worthy of keeping a guy around. However, he is owed $7 million on his deal this season and the D'Backs just acquired Addison Reed. That is leading to speculation that Arizona may try to trade Putz. They may have to take an equal amount in salary back, but it is better to have a $7 million player who plays regularly than pay the same for a guy that averages less than one inning every five games. If Putz is not moved, then he will probably set up for Reed., 42206=11/7/13: Arizona lost a coach and special assistant this week in Brad Ausmus. Ausmus was name the successor of Jim Leyland as the manager of the Detroit Tigers. Ausmus played for the organization in 1996 and again in 2000-2001. He is the latest in a trend of hiring young, first time managers who once played for the team they are managing now - presumably because they know the organization and can relate to the players. Others on this list are Robin Ventura with the Chicago White Sox and Mike Matheny of the St. Louis Cardinals - who just led his team to the NL Pennant and a World Series appearance., 61435=Paced by a strong start from young catcher Miguel Montero, the Arizona Diamonbacks begin the 2012 season with a perfect 3-0 record after sweeping the San Francisco Giants in their opening series. While strong performances from Chris Young and Aaron Hill have also helped the D'backs score 17 runs in their first three games, winning efforts from starters Ian Kennedy and Daniel Hudson have helped keep games tight to get the ball to veteran closer J.J. Putz, who already has two saves on the young season. The team will face the 1-3 San Diego Padres in a three-game series this week., 17192=8/14/14: There are not a whole lot of highlights this season for the Diamondbacks, but they did manage to pull off a rare stolen home base. Against Colorado last week, rookie David Peralta was on third base. He noticed catcher Michael McKenry lazily lobbed the baseball back to pitcher Rex Brothers between pitches. Peralta took off for home and scored. Arizona ended up winning the game 5-3 and showed how the Rockies were checked out for the season. It was the first stolen home base for the Diamondbacks since 2007. Ironically, the Dbacks played the Rockies in the National League Championship Serires that season., 12010=11/19/14: The Diamondbacks are looking to rebuild and rebound after a disastrous 2014 season. They have decent talent in places on the roster, enough that new top-man Tony LaRussa says he will be 'heartbroken' if the team is below .500 next season. Obviously, the pitching staff, particularly the rotation, needs a lot of help. They seem to have some interest in former Dodger Chad Billingsley, who has been classified as a 'person of interest', which sounds more like a criminal suspect than an acquisition target. It should be noted that new GM Dave Stewart was Billingsley's agent until he took the D'Backs job last month., 31517=3/6/14: The Diamondbacks will probably have to get some good production out of veteran Cody Ross this season if they are going to compete with the Dodgers and their money. Ross' 2013 season ended early when he sustained a fracture and dislocation of his right hip. He began running again recently and may only be a week out from making his spring training debut. He probably will not be on the squad that goes to Australia on March 22-23 to open the season against the Dodgers, though that may not be a bad thing - he will not have to spend days on flights there and back., 30251=3/20/14: It is commonly agreed upon that if the D'Backs are going to make a run at the ultra-rich Dodgers, then they would have to be at full capacity all season. Well, this is a blow. Even before the season starts, which for Arizona and L.A. was in Australia this week, staff ace Patrick Corbin was diagnosed with 'damage to the ulnar collateral ligament in his left elbow\". A damaged UCL usually means Tommy John surgery to repair the injury. That would mean that Corbin would probably miss all of the 2014 campaign, and even part of 2015. Here's hoping that is it not too bad and he can come back this season., 55095=6/13/13: One reason the D'Backs are in first place in the NL West is Didi Gregorius. The young shortstop was acquired in the offseason in a three team trade that sent Arizona's top pitching prospect Trevor Bauer away. Bauer was the third overall pick in the 2011 draft, and most experts scoffed at the trade. But Didi has been outstanding so far. His is batting well over 300, has 16 extra base hits, and has been a gem defensively. Most scouts missed on the guy, saying he could not hit. But the D'Backs are laughing now - all the way to the NL West title., 60127=The Arizona Diamondbacks took two of the first three games in a series against the Miami Marlins to move to an even 11-11 on the season. Joe Saunders improved to 2-1 in 2012 in Friday's 5-0 victory and has gotten off to a smoldering start, posting a 0.90 earned run average through four starts. Saunders went the distance, giving up only three hits in nine innings while striking out four. Youngster Patrick Corbin will make his first career major league start against the Marlins in the fourth and final game of the series. He will face off against starter Mark Buehrle, who has gotten off to a 1-3 start for the Marlins on the season., 63086=Arizona Diamondbacks tickets ensure that fans see the Diamondbacks playing top contenders throughout the entire MLB season. The Diamondbacks have their work cut out for them in a competitive National League West. With matchups with great teams like the San Francisco Giants and San Diego Padres and non-divisional meetings with the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs throughout the season, the Diamondbacks will have plenty of opportunity to test themselves against top talent in 2011. Buy your tickets now and don't miss the action!, 50760=8/1/13: Heading into August, it looks like the D'Backs are the only team that can catch the surging L.A. Dodgers. L.A. has been on a tear since getting several of their players back from injury. The Diamondbacks, for their part, have simply been playing good (not great) as they have all year. That was fine in the first half of the season, but now they need to show they can pitch and hit in the clutch. Arizona has been in the middle of a lot of trade talks in recent weeks - especially for starting pitching - and it will be interesting to see what they are willing to pay in order to make a run at the playoffs this season., 34111=2/6/14: The Diamondbacks are officially going forward with much of the braintrust they have had for the past few years, though that has been known for a while. The team extended the contracts for general manager Kevin Towers and manager Kirk Gibson for beyond the 2014 season. While that does not guarantee that either will be with the team next season or even next week, but the extensions ensure that neither is a lame duck this season. The D'backs also avoided arbitration with Gerardo Parra by agreeing to a one year $4.85 million contract for the 2014 season., 58869=5/2/12 - Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher, Wade Miley was voted NL Rookie of the Month for April. Miley led all National League rookie pitchers with a 3-0 record and a 1.29 ERA in 21 innings. Miley was originally the team's long reliever, but ended up in the starting rotation because of Daniel Hudson's right shoulder injury. In two starts, Miley is 2-0 with 13 strikeouts in 12 and 1/3 innings. His ERA is an impressive 0.00 as he has allowed no earned runs in both his starts. In one of his starts, Miley also took a no-hitter into the sixth inning earlier in the month. This was Miley's first career monthly award., 60781=In what has proven to be a tough division so far, the Arizona Diamondbacks currently sit at 9-8 in the N.L. West and are 4 games behind the division- leading Los Angeles Dodgers. The team got some bad news last week when it learned that star outfielder Chris Young would be sidelined with a shoulder injury for at least a few weeks. To combat the injury, the team called up top prospect A.J. Pollock, a first -round draft pick in 2009. Pollock was ranked by 'Baseball America' as one of the top five prospects in the Diamondbacks farm system prior to the season. The team will look to Pollock to help fill the void while Young recovers., 37249=1/2/14: The Diamondbacks have a solid franchise and good roster heading into the 2014. Arizona apparently feels that they are close to being able to catch the Dodgers, so they have made several risky moves for short term gain, possibly at the expense of the long-term health of the franchise. The D'Backs traded away their top pitching prospect Tyler Skaggs to get slugger Mark Trumbo. They also sent third base prospect Matt Davidson to the Chicago White Sox for closer Addison Reed. It is all just speculation now, but if the moves pay off this season, then they will pay off for Arizona., 47174=9/12/13: The D'backs have not had a particularly bad season, they are still over .500 as the season comes to a close. They had a chance to take ownership of the NL West and let that slip through their fingers. Now they sit 12 games behind the Dodgers and likely out of the playoffs. That all makes one wonder if the team will retain manager Kirk Gibson for 2014. Arizona seems to have most of the pieces to be a contender and had a great first half. It is the second half of the season which is worrisome. The team may well elect to find a more experienced MLB manager to guide this team next season., 8184=2/18/15: Current Arizona Diamondbacks head honcho, Tony LaRussa, innovated the game with his use of playing the odds. This was most notable on how he used relief pitchers. Rather than starters and closers, he employed a bullpen of specialists for late inning situations. Did it work? Just look at the rings on his fingers. The D'Backs may be making an offer to reliever Chad Gaudin. Gaudin missed the 2014 season with a neck injury but was very good in 2013 with the Giants, posting a 3.04 ERA over 97 innings. It is a low risk opportunity, and LaRussa has a history of making those work., 39728=12/5/13: Arizona is said to be working on a deal with pitcher Daniel Hudson. Hudson may not be a household name, but that is likely due to a few major injuries. He has made just nine starts since the beginning of the 2012 season, and will likely miss the majority of the 2014 season while recover from his second Tommy John surgery in two years. Clearly the D'Backs think they have something here if they are willing to put a guy under contract that cannot play for close to another year, especially since they have the option of getting rid of him this winter by declining to tender a contract.}",
