            "In this class we study the strategies different tree species use to: weather severe winds, pump water to their leaves, and disperse seeds. We will learn the all-important role of the cambium layer in creating the tree\u2019s trunk and the function of xylem and phloem cells.",
            "Join us for our two-day, one-night exploration of the 154,000 acre Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in eastern North Carolina as we look for birds, Black Bear, and other wildlife.",
            "Visit the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences for a live look at California\u2019s Monterey Bay and watch one of nature\u2019s great \u201creality\u201d shows, featuring humpback whales, blue whales, sea lions, dolphins, elephant seals, sea otters, great white sharks, shearwaters and brown pelicans.",
            "Each year over 35,000 visitors come to BugFest to experience over 100 exhibits, crafts, games and activities, including Caf\u00e9 Insecta!",
            "Join us at Prairie Ridge as we discover butterflies",
