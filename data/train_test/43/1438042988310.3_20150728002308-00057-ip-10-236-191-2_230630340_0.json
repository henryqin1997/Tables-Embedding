Medicines and medical devices save lives but they can be costly and can have serious adverse effects. Value-laden decisions are continuously being made at individual, institutional, national and international levels regarding the medicines and devices we need, want and can afford. In this unit of study, we will explore and critique global and national policies and processes related to medicines and medical devices, examining how research and development agendas are set; how medicines and other health technologies are assessed and evaluated; and how new technologies are translated into practice. We will also explore broader trends such as globalisation, commercialisation and changing consumer expectations. By the end of the course, students will understand the forces shaping the development, regulation, funding and uptake of health technologies both nationally and internationally, and the political, ethical, legal and economic issues",
