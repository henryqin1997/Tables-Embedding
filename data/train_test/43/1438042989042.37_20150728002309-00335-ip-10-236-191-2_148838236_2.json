More popularly descended than climbed, this road is nevertheless a scenic, well-paved climb with enough grade variations to create a unique character, and enough total climbing to rank up there in a virtual tie with Old La Honda Road in the Low-Key climb rating system. The relative distance from many of the Low-Key faithful may have reduced the turn-out somewhat relative to Low-Key favorites, but the riders in attendance all experienced a great day of climbing.}",

Results In the team competition, Brown Zone came out on top for the week after starting the minimum three riders, the two women joined by Joe Fant in the men's rankings. Western Wheelers, with recruit Clark Foy leading the way, was a close second, with Sisters and Misters of No Mercy, with second-place Carl Nielson leading, was third. The women had their own group or had the option of starting with a compatible men's group. Brown Zoners Lisa Penzel and Lynn Sestak both started with men's group 4, to take the top two places in the women's standings this week. Amy Cameron was the first from the women's start group, ahead of Laura Hipp and a super-impressive Lisa Emmerich, Lisa having gained a lot of fitness the past two seasons.
