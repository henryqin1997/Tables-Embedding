            "Any student! But the college is known for a great engineering program and agriculture/ animal studies",
            "Be active in school groups in order to meet new people. Go out for a team, a club, or sorority/fraternity. Any place is a great place to meet friends. Also don't party too hard, keep up the hard work in classes and actually go to class, you will be rewarded in the end with grades and even some potential bonus points!",
            "Mississippi State is really good with scholarship money and waiving out-of-state tuition. The class difficulty and presentation of new information and the price together make this school a great choice.",
            "I love it here! As a student far from home, it is kind of lonely at times, but the honors college, your academic college, and all your teachers try to make meeting new people fun and easy. I also enjoy the campus and the intramurals they have to offer.",
            "Some of the classes I had to take were repeats of high school but that just made it easier to adjust to being far away from home. Also it boosted my GPA. I have learned many things about independence and new facts from the other classes I have taken and am taking."

Tips for prospective students Come to university to learn and not just to party. Remember what you are there for and you'll do great. Bang for the buck MSU is one of the cheapest colleges in the nations, even if a student comes from out of state or is a non-resident. You receive great information compared to other colleges and you pay less tuition compared to other colleges. Am enjoying being here",
