[...] There's a lot to be said for a game that can make a grown woman squeal with glee dozens of times in a playthrough (especially a game that doesn't star Hello Kitty). In short, the long wait for Fez is entirely worth it. Play it, and I dare you not to smile.\" 100% \u2013 Joystiq \"The game's unique artwork, its perspective-shift mechanic, its nostalgia for the 16-bit years and its bewitchingly strange setting all exist in total harmony and make a single, deliberate statement.\" 10/10 \u2013 Eurogamer \"The sum of Fez\u2019s intelligent level designs, perception mechanic, massive number of stages and secrets, and incredible art is so much more than just a shout-out to old-school gaming. Fez is a game in love with games.\" 9.5/10 \u2013 http://ca.ign.com/articles/2012/04/11/fez-review}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Having gotten FEZ as part of the Steam Summer Sale, it was just one of many games I picked up over the course of the week-and-a-half event. However, as soon as I played it, I realized the amazing deal that I had gotten. In fact, I even mentioned to some friends to go and give it a try. For the 2 bucks that I got it for, FEZ is simply amazing. At full price, if you're into puzzlers and platformers, buy it. If not, still buy it. Trust me, it's a great game and the price is right. Value As for controls, the default controls spread all the way from left ctrl to the arrow keys. For me, this is a big time no-go (the only exception being The Binding of Isaac). When FEZ adds an option to change the controls to at lease wasd/ijkl, the controls system will inprove considerably. The game has simple pixel graphics, but the colors are really vivid in this game. The developers chose really bright color schemes and not dull/dark colors, which I have seen ruin games before. The only thing here is that when you rotate the world, there are no shadows so it is often difficult to tell which direction you have to turn. Controls and Graphics One of the things that I personally liked about this game is that it really isn't very addicting.",
    "textAfterTable": "Final Points on the Game Not only is FEZ a great platformer, the rotating world concept also makes it one of the most unique games in it's class. This is a must-buy!
