            "On May 29, 2010, marimuse from Port Townsend, WA wrote: marilyn Port Townsend, WA zone 8 I have this plant in a sunny spot in my garden and it has grown very large since planted last summer. The blooms are beautiful, extending up about 16 inches, and the plant has grown to about a foot in diameter. However, the very many blooms have ended up being much redder than the tag indicated, and I am not a fan of red in my otherwise much more subdued garden- purples, pinks, white, blue, yellow. Also, the deer return frequently to munch, although I use PlantSkydd, which works very well for most of my other deer salad plants. So, for me, although in most ways the plant would be a very positive rating, I am giving it a neutral- and giving it away.",

The flowers remind me of tangerine ballerinas ... so danity. I will try to extend the flowering time by deadheading because it is such a lovely addition to my garden.",

As soon as the weather warms in spring, new leaves shoot up and the plant produces buds. Although I have the geum in a mostly sunny place and fertilize it, it grows only about 8 inches tall. So I leave it in the front of the bed.",

            "On Mar 13, 2001, Terry from Murfreesboro, TN (Zone 7a) wrote: A member of the rose family, Geum is a perennial with handsome foliage with divided leaves. Evergreen in warmer climates. Double, semi-double or single flowers in bright orange, yellow and red bloom from spring into late summer if deadheaded. Plant in average, well-drained soil."
