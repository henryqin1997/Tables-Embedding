            "I think the best solution is that the publishers leave Tokyo. Then everyone is gona be happy until they realise how much money they lost because something so stupid like this law (tax income), than they erase this shit. This is like what the americans did in the 20's or 30's, forbidding the alcohol consume. But really, Ishihara writes guro and rape novels? Books are way more dangerous than comics, because the reader imagines the story.",

            "Quote from celestialradiance Quote from Hell_Clues And let's take this in the context of japan, where people are getting arrested for sticking cameras in schools to videotape people. Where lolicon is actually having an impact on their society and not from your faraway perspective. For you to say that, you assume those sick people are taking such actions due to the impact of reading or watching lolicon. However, you will have to run a test and a study. Such a statement holds no validity otherwise. In your words, \"let's take this in the context of america, where people are getting arrested for murdering and raping people. Where crime shows are actually having an impact on our society.\" I think it's about time to halt the broadcasting of television series and the publishing of stories and graphic novels. My reply: Click here for a study which shows that storks bring babies. Similarly for manga/games depicting child rape in promoting rape-related crimes. And doesn't the world already agree that the Japanese government is pretty screwed up? Just my opinion.",

So put age restrictions on it. But don't ban and make it inaccessible to adults. 1) While research on whether reading about deviancy of this particular manner actually makes you a deviant (murderer, rapist, pedophile, etc) is scarce, the studies that do exist don't support that claim. 2) This is not an issue of morals but rather, it concerns personal liberties. People generally don't care when it doesn't effect them, but do care when it does. However, it will be too late then. How long is it going to take for them to start banning things which aren't fringe and consumed exclusively by \"hardcore deviants\"? Last I remember, one of the series they were seriously considering banning (on their long lists) was Neon Genesis Evangelion due to it containing sexually suggestive materials with minors. People should care even if it doesn't directly affect them, but just as I pointed it, it may already affect them and they may just be oblivious to its effects :/.",

This type of manga is probably so embedded in society already that the result would probably be the same as prohibition of alcohol in america; it won't change a thing except make a large portion of the population criminals. If this is going to be voted on it should be a proposition or measure on a ballot voted directly by the people that live in that city/district/country. Not sure if they do that in Japan. In order for something to be changed at the core of society the people need to bring that change not a few hundred lawmakers many of which have their heads in very dark and smelly places.",

As I've said before I think it's the actual people that should decide this stuff not some politicans that are probably too old to even reproduce without the aid of medication. Ah, I see it now. Although, really, I think that parents who try to control their children are taking a bad approach to parenting. That \"control\" can ever only reach as far as the parents can, which is not everywhere and will not last forever. Also, if children grow up being taught what to think rather than how to think, they will not be able to adapt to situations that the parents didn't account for... or worse, will be taught to act in certain ways that may seem to make sense in most situations, but could go horribly wrong in others. Rather, I'd advocate empowering and guiding children to be able to make good decisions for themselves. Some parents already do this, but many do not. Schools could also do this, but rarely seem to (often supported by the argument that children are too young to learn, despite the fact that children seem to be much faster at learning than adults). Also, if you mean to say that the decision should be left up to the people en masse, then I would question exactly how qualified the average person is to be making that kind of decision... I would feel much more comfortable leaving the decision to a group of qualified experts rather than your \"average Joe\".",

Where the heck are you getting your information? These so called \"Otaku\" you speak of actually represent a good portion of Japan's GDP. They aren't the \"neets\" or jobless the media portrays them to be. On average, Otaku have higher than average earning wages. It's their right to choose what they spend it on. I personally feel that parents should choose whether or not to allow their children to be exposed to these influences. They are free to propose age limits, but don't ban it all together for the general public. People like you should not be allowed to impose rights on others. It's your personal choice whether you want to consume this material, but don't force others to be just like you."
