            "In an LDS environment you don'teven have to worry about people stealing your stuff or anything. I leave my backpack and everything at the campus computers in the halls while I go to the bathroom and never worry about if it will all be there when I get back.",
            "It's an LDS gospel oriented campus and weekly devotionals make it a spiritually uplifting place to attend college.",
            "You get more than you pay for here, in my opinion.",
            "The school doesn't have much but it's right in the center of Salt Lake City so there's always something to do close by.",
            "They offer meals at the Carriage Cafe but they are closed a lot. So it's easier and sometimes cheaper to go find somewhere else to eat outside campus, which is easy because it's right in downtown salt lake city.",
            "You just live wherever you want, the college doesn't have dorms.",
            "The classes all have homework, it depends on the teacher a ton though. Every class is different depending on who is the teacher.",
            "If you need a great college for not much money, definitely come here. It's worth it even if you just want to get to know the college life before transferring somewhere larger or with your specific major.",
            "It's great here, classes are good. You will never get lost in the one building college."

Then there's the fact that one receives great instruction on a subject, as well as these beneficial career workshops--which I believe that we should pay for, since they seem to give us an edge., 131849=You're in downtown Salt Lake! There are two huge malls that you can visit anytime. There are movie theaters, dances all the time, temple square is beautiful year round, not to mention skiing and snowboarding in the winter. It's an awesome place to run and hike because you're surrounded by mountains. Every Tuesday at 11:20 there is a devotional at the Assembly Hall and they're really great to go to and hear the speakers., 157960=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students 1) Make your essays original/creative when you apply. 2) Make sure you know what you want from your college experience before you make a final decision. 3) Take initiative to call/e-mail the school and find out everything you can! Bang for the buck The tuition is such a great price compared to pretty much every other college. There are lots of colleges whose tuition is $10,000 or more per semester! However, at LDSBC, the tuition is less than $5,000 for a full year. Plus, it teaches marketable skills for people who want to earn more money while they're in college. Will enjoy being here Although I wish they had more fun electives, I think the classes they have will be very enjoyable. I'm also excited to be around so many students with the same beliefs and values as me. :) Will learn a lot I haven't yet attended, but when I was looking at the class list, there were so many amazing classes that were specific to each major, and classes for everyone to take. There was a wide variety of classes--not very many fun electives, but definitely some great learning opportunities. Also, just by talking to some",
