For example, any processor controlled device wherein device operation is a function of discrete, sequential processor states and which is subject to catastrophic power failure would benefit from the inclusion of the present invention. It should be appreciated that although various voltage levels were described in the exemplary embodiment discussed above, it is possible to produce the present invention for operation at other voltage levels. Furthermore, the waveforms displayed in FIG. 3 are for purposes of example. Other wave relations may be established, depending upon desired results in a particular processor controlled environment. While the memory incorporated into the present invention has been characterized as a CMOS device, it will further be appreciated that other types of solid state memories may be substituted therefor, e.g. NMOS, magnetic bubble. Therefore, the scope of the invention should be limited only by the breadth of the claims. FIG. 4 shows a typical power supply that may be used in conjunction with a gaming device of the type for which the present invention is intended. The power supply includes a full wave rectifier CR3 and CR4 connected to transformer T1 and producing a DC output that is filtered by capacitor C1-C3 and regulated by IC regulator U87. Removing the CMOS memory from the game does not disturb the memory contents, but",
