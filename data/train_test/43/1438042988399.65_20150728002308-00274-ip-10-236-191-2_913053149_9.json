Become friends with the professors to keep up good standing within the classroom. Do NOT underestimate the college simply because it is a community college, the college is actually better than most universities when it comes to subject matter because the professors coordinate with each other and take pride in their classes. Bang for the buck Tuition here is awesome and extremely affordable for the average student with a part time job and living at home. Books are, like everywhere, a little expensive, but it is only because of the professors since they like to take time into choosing their book because they know what each student should learn. The food prices are not bad since it is the local restaurants where people usually eat at, and there are no fees to go anywhere as well. Great prices for everyone. Am enjoying being here",
