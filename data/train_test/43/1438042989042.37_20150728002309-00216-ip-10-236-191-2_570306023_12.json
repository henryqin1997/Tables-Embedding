Many of these are treated by the Mathematics Department as equivalent for the purposes of prerequisites (PQ) and/or program requirements (PR). I switched between Applied Science and Science/Arts. Do I have to retake courses that I've effectively taken already? For example, do I have to take MATH 221 if I already took MATH 152?

Sc. students wanting to make similar kinds of replacements (e.g. MATH 221 instead of MATH 152), you must contact the Applied Science Advising Center to get official permission to make any such changes. Similarly, this list does not apply to prerequisites for non-MATH courses (e.g. APSC 160 may not be a valid prerequisite replacement for CPSC 111 for a second year CPSC course - permission must be granted by a CS advisor). (ID 34) I can get credit for Math 100 (by AP scores or the Challenge exam). Should I do this or take a first term math course? This is really up to you. If you take credit for MATH 100, you can open up room for an additional course you are interested in or that would help you get ahead in your degree program (MATH 223 or 221 is a good option in first year if you follow this route). Some students prefer to take MATH 100 instead, to firm up their knowledge. (ID 58) What are the differences between the first year calculus offerings?
