            "Memoria2 - #70 Lucas just doesn\u2019t care about Harriet\u2019s personality quirks, nor Matty\u2019s obsession with pointing them out. But who could be in the car?",
            "Memoria2 - #71 Fuel is a year older than Lucas, and the two grew up together. A long time ago, Lucas\u2019s father saved him from a burning house. Now he\u2019s a cool guy with a car.",
            "Memoria2 - #72 Harriet doesn\u2019t quite know how to act towards good looking older guys. Luckily, Fuel knows how to best deal with an awkward teenage girl: ignore her. If you were wondering, the popcorn-looking thing on Fuel\u2019s mirror is a dolphin ossicle (ear bone), which reminds him of home, along with the feather of a red bird that does as well. Lastly, Roger might be a vaguely familiar character if you read M2: Harmony\u2026",
            "Memoria2 - #73 Lucas listens, Fuel talks, Matty criticizes Harriet again, Harriet\u2026 um, we\u2019ll get back to her later.",
            "Memoria2 - #74 The closer you get to home, the more familiar everything feels, like traveling back in time\u2026 Too bad Harriet is still a bit disrespectful at this point."
