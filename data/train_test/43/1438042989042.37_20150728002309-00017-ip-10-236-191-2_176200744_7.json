Parameter Description The Accumulation Radar L1B Geolocated Radar Echo Strength Profiles data set contains elevation and surface measurements. Parameter or Variable IceBridge campaigns are conducted on an annual repeating basis. Arctic and Greenland campaigns are conducted during March, April, and May, and Antarctic campaigns are conducted during October and November. Temporal Resolution These data were collected as part of Operation IceBridge funded campaigns from 06 May 2010 to 07 May 2012. Temporal Coverage Referenced to WGS-84 Ellipsoid. Projection and Grid Description Spatial Resolution varies dependent on along-track, cross-track, and aircraft height characteristics. Spatial Resolution Arctic / Greenland: Southernmost Latitude: 60\u00b0 N Northernmost Latitude: 90\u00b0 N Westernmost Longitude: 180\u00b0 W Easternmost Longitude: 180\u00b0 E Spatial coverage for the IceBridge accumulation radar campaigns include Greenland and surrounding ocean areas. Spatial Coverage The entire data set is approximately 150 GB. Volume The GPS Applanix .out output files are approximately 485 MB to 820 MB. The GPS Applanix .mat output files are approximately 139 MB to 235 MB. The KML files are approximately 3 KB to 216 KB. The PNG files are approximately 372 KB to 693 KB. The JPEG files are approximately 78 KB to 161 KB. The MATLAB files are approximately 3 MB to 8 MB. The binary files range from approximately 61 MB to 203 MB.",
    "textAfterTable": "3. Data Access and Tools Get Data Data are available via FTP. Software and Tools MATLAB files may be opened using the NSIDC MATLAB reader, or the Octave high-level language. JPEG files may be opened using any image viewing program that recognizes the JPEG file format. KML files are read by GIS software packages and earth browsers such as Google Earth or Google Maps. 4. Data Acquisition and Processing Data Acquisition Methods The radar architecture is a combined stepped-chirped system. The complete bandwidth from 565 MHz to 885 MHz is divided into 16 overlapping subbands 550-600, 570-620,...850-900. Data is recorded on each subband. In post processing, the subbands are combined into a single frequency band. The accumulation radar is only installed on the P-3 aircraft using an antenna installed in the bomb bay. Derivation Techniques and Algorithms The MATLAB code below shows how to compensate for elevation so the echogram data mimics constant elevation flight at the maximum elevation in each data frame. Figure 1 illustrates an echogram without elevation compensation and with elevation compensation. Figure 1. Elevation Compensation Echogram Flat Surface Range Resolution For a flat surface the range resolution is",
