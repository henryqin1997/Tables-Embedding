            "What True Grit (Might Have) Looked Like: The Photographs of F.M. Steele Fri, 09/20/2013 (All day) - Sun, 12/01/2013 (All day) Central Library In the 1890s Francis Marion Steele began photographing cowboys, recording the work and play of these iconic figures on the open ranges of southwest Kansas, southeast Colorado, northeast New Mexico, and the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma. This genre-crossing exhibit juxtaposes Steele\u2019s photographs with passages from True Grit to help visitors envision the world in which heroine Mattie Ross and her companions Rooster Cogburn and Texas Ranger LaBoeuf had their adventures. Guerrillas in Our Midst Sun, 08/18/2013 (All day) - Sun, 12/29/2013 (All day) Central Library Before and during the Civil War, Confederate guerrillas \u2013 men like William Clarke Quantrill, \u201cBloody Bill\u201d Anderson, and Frank and Jesse James \u2013 battled federal troops and Jayhawker irregulars along the Missouri-Kansas border. That brutal era comes to life in Guerrillas in Our Midst, an original exhibit of drawings and photographs from the Library\u2019s Missouri Valley Special Collections. It covers not only the war but also its aftermath, when former bushwhackers like the James brothers turned to outlawry.
