Can't do that with the 60-day DL. So Wang, Detwiler and Flores can't return until June 4 at the earliest., 9747=Are DL rules / start dates different for 60 Day vs 15 Day?I could see this, since 60 Day frees up a roster spot.Reyes and Lidge went 15 Day DL and are eligible to return on April 10.So obviously their clock started well before opening day.So 15 day DL seems to start March 26, 10 days before the season starts, and 60 DL starts April 4, the date the season starts.Guess there are different rules., 13200=Wang and Detwiler will both be able to pitch minor league rehab assignments while on the 60-day DL, so I don't think this would put them off a late May/early June schedule.Poor Coste. I don't know if he is really injured, but his world sure has been a bit insecure lately.}",
