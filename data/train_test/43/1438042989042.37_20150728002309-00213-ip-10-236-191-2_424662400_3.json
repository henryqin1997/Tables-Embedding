He cut his teeth at the first-class level and courted immediate success, snaring four five-wicket hauls, and ten in one match, in his first couple of seasons. His attacking style of bowling had a major impact in the 2010 Caribbean T20 where he finished with ten wickets in four games at the mean average of 8.20, conceding just 5.12 runs an over.
