The section \"Using Quotation Marks and Escaping Strings in a PSP Script\" describes how to use quotation marks in strings that are used in various PL/SQL Server Pages elements. The order and placement of the PL/SQL Server Pages directives and declarations is usually not significant. It becomes significant only when another file is included. For ease of maintenance, Oracle recommends that you put the directives and declarations near the beginning of the file. In the typical case, it is a mixture of HTML (providing the static parts of the page) and PL/SQL (providing the dynamic content). In the most complex case, it is a PL/SQL subprogram that generates all the content of the web page, including the tags for title, body, and headings. In the simplest case, it is an HTML file. Compiling it as a PL/SQL server page produces a stored subprogram that outputs the same HTML file. The file for a PL/SQL server page must have the extension .psp. It can contain whatever content you choose, with text and tags interspersed with PL/SQL Server Pages directives, declarations, and scriptlets. A server page can take these forms: To develop a PL/SQL server page, you can start with an existing web page or with an existing stored subprogram.",
