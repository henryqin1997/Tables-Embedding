            "Clubs for a variety of interests are available; some even offer college credit!",
            "Great for students with a lack of funds or students that are undecided. The college is also great for working people.",
            "The college is very affordable and provides high-quality education that can fit into any schedule.",
            "A student lounge is available with modern gaming systems, a pool table, a large TV, and a cafeteria. The campus hosts a large library, and a low-commitment community orchestra plays year-round.",

            "Brevard Community College is very flexible in its academics. Students can progress slowly through courses or speed through them, and the courses run a variety of difficulties.",
            "Register for classes early, buy books early, and get to know the campus before classes start.",
            "Brevard Community College is an excellent jumping off point for anyone pursuing higher education. Classes consist of high school students, fresh graduates, and people who have been in the professional world for years already. A single semester leaves students feeling more confident about school and builds new contacts for the future."
