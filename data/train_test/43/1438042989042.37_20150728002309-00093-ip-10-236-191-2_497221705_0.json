What they really want to know is how producers go about feeding the world and how it will affect their health. To find the best way to reach out to consumers, new research was conducted in September 2012. About 30 opinion leaders in urban areas like Chicago, Ill., Los Angeles, Calif., Boston, Mass., and Alexandria, Va., were part of a focus group and had in-depth discussions about key messages. What was found could change the influence agriculturists have on today\u2019s consumers.}",
