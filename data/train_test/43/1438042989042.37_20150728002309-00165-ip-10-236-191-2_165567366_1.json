Romero. His numbers at Syracuse seemed solid (and the Yankees were willing to grab him pretty quickly). Was it simply that the Nats couldn't find room on the 25-man roster for him? Did they not like what they were seeing (even with the good numbers)? Is there more to the story than that? July 15, 2011 5:19 PM _______________________________Romero had a clause in his contract with the Nats of being brought up to the Nats by a specified date or he could get a release and they weren't ready to do it. At this stage in Romero's career, he is a LOOGY and the only guy to replace would have been Burnett IMHO and obviously Rizzo wasn't ready to make the move.Oh well. It was worth the chance with the hope he hung out until September 1st for expanded rosters., 91438=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows.

You can also listen to the station on 94.3 FM, 92.7 FM and online at ESPN980.com. Click here for past audio clips., 59327=Detwiler injured? I have family in from out of town and they vetoed the game in the third inning. Thanks Exposremains and Mark Z for the best laugh of the week. Do we think Livo has reached his \"I'm tired at the end of the season\" a few months early? Anyone have an idea what is going wrong for him? Congrats to the Braves for their 10,000 win. May it be at least three days before they make it to 10,001. I would sign off with GYFNG, but I think more appropriate is my new favorite Daveyism, \"ooof.\" Night all., 36574=I could be wrong about the MASN deal but I also remember that Angelos has to send the Nationals a check each year for around 25 million bucks!! And he can't be happy about that.Eugene \u2013 the Romero deal has probably already been discussed but in his contract, if he was not in the Majors by July 15 he could ask for his release. The Nationals were not about to make that move so they released him a day early.Worst local marketing I have seen lately. In Baby's are Us near Burtonsville, they have all kinds of kids clothes for Orioles but NOTHING for the Nationals. I told them my grandson and I would never shop there and I think they thought I was joking. I can order stuff on-line thank you.Go Nats!, 33143=phil dunn said\u2026 When MASN was formed back in 2005, The Orioles franchise owned 90% of MASN and Major League Baseball owned 10%. The 10% MLB ownership transferred to the Nationals owners when MLB sold the team in 2006 The Nationals ownership gradually increases to 33% over a period of time. Hence, the Orioles will always have ownership control of MASN. That was the carrot that MLB gave Peter Angelos for not objecting to the franchise being moved from Montreal to DC. July 15, 2011 5:06 PM ____________________________________http://wnst.net/wordpress/news/2010/08/08/it-was-peter-angelos-vs-steve-bisciotti-in-latest-skirmish-over-masn-ravens-rights/http://content.usatoday.com/communities/dailypitch/post/2010/05/orioles-owner-peter-angelos-likes-the-success-of-nearby-nationals/1Phil \u2013 The worst part of the deal is it takes 23 years to get to the 33% ownership in 2028. Every time you think of the raw deal the Nats got for $450 million when the Oakland A's could have been brought to DC at approx $175 million and had free market bargaining for their own TV deal.The other CARROT that Angelos got was a minimum guaranteed value for his team. If he runs them into the ground, he still has a minimum buy out and there were some other perks he got also., 72693=Plus have to figure Coffey and Gaudin are on the trading block for whatever Rizzo can get for them. That will likely include Marquis as he won't be back next year anyway and won't bring any xtra special draft picks in 2012., 25783=When MASN was formed back in 2005, The Orioles franchise owned 90% of MASN and Major League Baseball owned 10%.

Sure, Burtonsville is far north in Montgomery County and very short-sighted on their parts. When Strasburg and Harper are full-time in Washington, the reach of fandemonium will spread real far north, west, and south!If Chien-Ming Wang gets called up, the Nats will spread real far east.So, Babies r Them better get ready for the Nats marketing machine!, 103761=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC.

Hudson, you'll recall, is 11-3 with a 2.00 ERA in 20 career starts against this franchise. That said, the Nats have beaten him in two of their last three encounters (last September and this May)., 45011=Laynce Nix not so hot anymoreHItting in July 0 HR 3 RBI .192Just saying, 11269=The Braves franchise (which dates all the way back to 1876 in Boston) is one victory shy of 10,000 in its history.That's a long time ago.

Custer was alive., 78110=I wish to associate myself with the comments of my esteemed colleague from, uh, the Couchdom. ;-)\u2014Sec 3, My Sofa said\u2026 Scooter said\u2026 Man, slogging through this recap just totally ruined my evening sitting in a rented cottage at the beach.
