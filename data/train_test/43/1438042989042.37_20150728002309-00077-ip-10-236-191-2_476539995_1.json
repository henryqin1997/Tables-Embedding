Zan, the protagonist, is tran This was one of my favorite books as a kid. Was thrilled to discover it is still a good book when I read it as an adult. Zan, the protagonist, is transported back in time to a (presumed) prehistoric tribe. Zan's time with these people is a well written comming of age story. We never do learn who exactly the tribe is or why Zan was taken to them. All we know is that her transportation takes place in public when she is emotionally distraught ~ she spends quite a few months with this tribe and is magically transported back to her real life in another moment of emotional turmoil. When she returns, she discovers that she has actually only been gone a day. But she still has a token from her tribe as a physical reminder that she was really there and didn't just imagine the whole thing. I love that Mazer doesn't attempt to explain why all of this happens, she just tells the story. It does leave a lot of unanswered questions, especially regarding individual memnbers of the ancient tribe and what their future holds. However, to my knowledge she has never written a sequel. A quick read and an awesome book. If you come across a copy at a library or yardsale, definately worth it. I'm lucky to own a copy & have read it many, many times :) ...more",

            "review The Goodreads synopsis for The Magicians claims that it mixes the magic of classics such as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, The Chronicles of N The Goodreads synopsis for The Magicians claims that it mixes the magic of classics such as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, The Chronicles of Narnia, and A Wizard of Earthsea. I\u2019ve never read Earthsea, but Lev Grossman borrows from and leans on the mythology and world building of Harry Potter, Narnia, and even Dungeons and Dragons (remember those days of role playing?!) so heavily that his writing goes from paying homage to copying to simply ludicrous imitation. Yes, he was obviously quite influenced by these books, but unfortunately it was to the point that he was not very successful at creating his own world. Making things worse, for the majority of the book, Grossman tells us the story of Quentin\u2019s life, rather than letting the story breathe and unfold on its own. The Magicians reads as if it is the story of a story. All together, it is 402 pages long. In a mere 280 pages, we read about Quentin\u2019s welcome to and discovery of a magical world. We follow him as he experiences 5 years of magician college and stay with him for a year or so afterwards as he tries to figure out what to do with his life. And of course during this time, Quentin develops friendships, finds a girlfriend, and does some soul searching. All in 280 pages. That simply isn\u2019t enough space to write about one man\u2019s immersion into a new culture (hell, a new world!), personal growth and existential crisis. At page 281, Quentin and friends are transported to the magical world of Fillory. Grossman repeatedly tells us what a fantastical wonderful world Fillory is ~ but of course, it\u2019s a made up a children\u2019s series (that borrows quite heavily from The Chronicles of Narnia) that Quentin first discovered and loved as a child. And as he grew, unlike other kids, he never forgot or let go of his love of Fillory. My problem comes from the fact that Fillory, much like the rest of the novel, is special simply because Grossman tells us that it is. We don\u2019t read excerpts from the books, or hear other characters discussing the books merits ~ but we do read Quentin\u2019s thoughts on them pretty frequently. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but I have a hard time giving a rat\u2019s ass about something just because I am told that I should. One thing that I can say in defense of Fillory is that, once Quentin and friends enter it, the writing undergoes a dramatic change. Suddenly Grossman slows down his pace, gives the story some room, and begins writing as a ...well ...writer rather than a story teller. The change in writing styles is so remarkable and so sudden that there is no doubt in my mind that Grossman has done this on purpose. It shows that while Quentin spends the majority of his life disillusioned and unaffected, in Fillory he can really come alive and become the man he was meant to be. Blah, blah blah. Unfortunately, at this point I had muddled through so much bad writing that I was long past caring about Quentin and his plight. I like Grossman\u2019s characters, and I like what he does with them. But I do not like being told, and told, and told what happens without ever getting a chance to experience the story for myself. And, frankly, much of this story has been done before and been done much, much better. ...more",

The beauty of this collection is that each story pulls the reader in a little more than the one before it.

            "review Zombies Vs. Unicorns and who is the winner? Zombies! Thanks to Carrie Ryan's Bougainvillea. Undoubtedly the creepiest, most spine-tingly zombie story I Zombies Vs. Unicorns and who is the winner? Zombies! Thanks to Carrie Ryan's Bougainvillea. Undoubtedly the creepiest, most spine-tingly zombie story I have read since... well, since Ryan's The Forest of Hands and Teeth. Haters of that book shouldn't be dissuaded though. This story is lacking the angst and lurve triangles found in Forrest. Instead, we get complex, unique, sympathetic and believable characters in the midst of a zombie apocalypse. And of course a healthy dose of the zombie horror that Ryan does so very, very well. Notable zombie mentions include: Maureen Johnson\u2019s wonderfully bizarre Children of the Revolution, where we see something akin to a mix between old fashioned voodoo type zombies, new age religion and celebrity culture. Yeah, I know, it sounds like too much. But trust me, Johnson makes it work. Libba Bray\u2019s Prom Night This is the woman who wroteA Great and Terrible Beauty? It surprised me, because although I liked (liked, not loved) the first Gemma Doyle book, this dark, post-zombie apocalyptic story is not only better written, but so much more emotional and thought provoking. This one will stay with me for a long, long time. Not so awesome zombie entries include: Garth Nix\u2019s The Highest Justice I\u2019m not really sure whether this is Team Zombie or Team Unicorn, because it has a little of both. Either way, I didn\u2019t care for it. Alaya Dawn Johnson\u2019s Love Will Tear Us Apart I liked it but\u2026. think Twillight: The Zombie Version. Granted, this is written so much better than Twillight. However, I can\u2019t help thinking that the novel everyone loves to hate inspired this one. Scott Westenfeld\u2019s Inoculata struck me as an introduction to a larger story, rather than a complete short. Cassandra Clare\u2019s Cold Hands didn\u2019t even belong here. Really. Zombie light. For kids. Kids who are not very discriminating readers. On the unicorn side, the case for their dominance and supreme scariness was very nearly won by Diana Peterfreund\u2019s The Care and Feeding of Your Baby Killer Unicorn. Silly title, no? Oh yeah, I agree. This is the first story I read from this collection. I know virtually nothing about Peterfreund\u2019s writing (although I apparently know lots about her author-behaving-badly reputation) so I was more than a little curious to find out what kind of writer she is. This story blew me away. For a short story, there was an amazing amount of depth to it. Peterfreund created a complex and believable world in which unicorns ~ scary, evil killer unicorns exist. This was also a bit of a coming of age story, a romance story, and a little bit of religion thrown in as well. Yes, I know it seems like way too much. But it worked. I was hooked from the moment the young protagonist Wen sees a live unicorn at a circus side show\u2026 the unicorn growls\u2026 it\u2019s handler grabs Wen\u2019s arm and hisses to her, \u201cYou\u2019re one of us\u201d Oh gawd, I literally got chills at that moment and was reminded of the superbly creepy scene from Freaks when everyone is chanting, \u201cGooble Gobble one of us, one of us.\u201d Long story short\u2026 I think I\u2019m going to have to read some of Peterfreund\u2019s work in the future. Notable unicorn mentions: Meg Cabot\u2019s Princess Prettypants had the feel of a silly teen movie, but I loved it anyway. Just as light and fluffy as the title implies. Kathleen Duey\u2019s The Third Virgin is dark, thought provoking and almost creepy enough to be a zombie story. Only there aren\u2019t any zombies ;) Not so awesome unicorn stories are: Margo Lanagan\u2019s A Thousand Flowers is very\u2026 typical of Lanagan. (view spoiler)[ What the fuck is it with this woman and bestiality??? (hide spoiler)] I was disappointed to find this story difficult to get into. She presented a vague world, and multiple points of view. I found the whole thing to be a bit messy and the story just never got a good flow. Naomi Novik\u2019s Purity Test just didn\u2019t do it for me. A little fantasy oriented a little snarky. Somehow this seemed to be lacking imagination. Like all anthologies, this was a mixed bag. But the great ones more than made up for the so-so stories. Zombies Vs. Unicorns, as so many people have said, is such a fantastic concept. I am kicking myself for not having read this collection sooner! ...more",
            "review The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake is such a tough book to review. I am a fan of Aimee Bender's writing, and loved this book while reading it, but t The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake is such a tough book to review. I am a fan of Aimee Bender's writing, and loved this book while reading it, but this novel is leading up to something big\u2026 and nothing happens. Nothing is resolved. The ending is blah. Let me back up. The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake begins with Rose Edelstein and her incredibly dysfunctional family on Rose\u2019s ninth birthday. As she bites into her homemade lemon chocolate cake, Rose realizes that with every bite she is able to feel the emotions her mother felt as she was baking the cake. Perhaps this is the right time to mention that Rose\u2019s mother is an unhappy housewife who is battling depression and perhaps a touch of borderline personality disorder. So, birthday girl Rose becomes overwhelmed with her mother\u2019s negative emotions and is unable to finish her cake. From this day forward, when Rose eats any prepared food, she is able to \"taste\" the emotions experienced by the person who cooked or baked the food as they were making it. In the case of produce, Rose is able to discern which fruits and vegetable were picked by overworked, underpaid, unhappy immigrant workers, as opposed to those which were grown on a local, organic farm. For whatever reason (perhaps literary interest? Drama?) Rose is much more sensitive to negative emotions found in food than she is to positive. Faced with such an onslaught of sensation, Rose very quickly turns to prepackaged junk food and processed food. The only way she can eat in peace is to consume food produced in factories with as little human involvement as possible. So this story is about Rose, right? The struggles she faces and how she overcomes them? Yes and no. Although The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake follows Rose from her ninth birthday to her early twenties, a lot of her formative years are skipped in favor of telling us more about her family, which includes a messed up mom, emotionally uninvolved father, and depressed, antisocial and possibly schizophrenic brother. There is also an absent maternal grandmother with a touch of dementia, and a deceased paternal grandfather with a \u201cspecial skill\u201d similar to Rose\u2019s ability. But again, I got ahead of myself. When I said the brother was possibly schizophrenic, that is entirely my take on him. As he is written, he too possesses a \u201cspecial skill\u201d of the magical realism type. And that, despite how dissatisfied the ending left me, is what I really love about this book. The thing is, Rose\u2019s family, from grandparents down to Rose herself, are more than a little mentally unbalanced. What is brilliant about this novel, is that Rose\u2019s odd ability can easily be explained away as a very unhappy, empathetic and possibly slightly autistic girl. I don\u2019t want to go into too much detail or give away possible spoilers, but Rose\u2019s knowledge of food, it\u2019s source, and it\u2019s history could have easily been learned from her own research (whether she admits that to herself or not.) And her \u201ctasting\u201d emotions could simply be a result of her being sensitive and intuitive. Do nine year olds recognize an unhappy parent? Of course they do. Many people are great (whether the consciously realize it or not) at reading body language, listening for a tone of voice, and much more that tells so much about a person. Rose could very easily be one of those people. And, again, her family is messed up. Not just a little, but a lot. So is it that big of a stretch to imagine that Rose may tell herself that her brother has a \u201cspecial skill\u201d rather than face the fact that he is on the train to crazy town? When we learned that her grandpa also had a \u201cspecial skill\u201d I was especially convinced of the mental illness aspect of this story. Unfortunately, despite how much I was digging this novel, it ended on a rather abrupt, unfinished note. Somehow I got the feeling that Aimee Bender had an awesome idea, but just didn\u2019t know where to take it or what to do with it. People who need a definite resolution to their books should stay away from this one. Otherwise, if you are not bothered by ambiguity, it\u2019s worth a shot. I struggled with rating this ~ the ending irked me so much that I wanted to give it a two. But really, I love the idea, I love the mental health aspect (even if that is my own interpretation) and I love the writing, so three stars it is. I\u2019m definitely going to continue reading Aimee Bender. ...more"
