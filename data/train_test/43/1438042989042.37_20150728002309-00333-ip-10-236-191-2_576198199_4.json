All samples yielded patterns which varied only in the equatorial direction over the age range of samples used in this study. Diffraction experiments were conducting using the Rotating Anode X-ray generator at the Rex Vowels Low Angle Diffraction Laboratory, UNSW, and at Rigaku Corporation Japan with sample to detector distances of 200 mm and 1000 mm. Synchrotron studies were carried out on the BL15A Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan, at the BioCAT Facility, the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne, USA and at the SAXS-WAXS Beam line at the Australian Synchrotron, Melbourne. Sample to detector distances at the synchrotrons varied between 400 mm and 1300 mm at the various facilities. Calibration was achieved by comparison with diffraction patterns from moist rat-tail tendon or by comparison with a silver behenate sample (first order spacing: 5.838 nm) at the synchrotrons. The synchrotron fibre diffraction intensity distributions were recorded on FUJI BASIII imaging plates at the Photon Factory and at BioCAT and the data was extracted by electronic scan. A MAR165 detector was used on-line on BioCAT and at the Australian Synchrotron to aid in the alignment of the sample and also for data collection. Initial analyses were carried out using a combination of MATLAB-R-2007 and ProcessFITS or SAX15ID. This was followed by a high precision analysis of the two dimensional data using the astronomy packages IRAF (1986) and SAO Image (1991). These Smithsonian packages have been designed for viewing stars over a wide range of intensities from the very weak to the very strong by continually limiting the intensity range under observation. They are, therefore, perfectly designed for handling the wide dynamic range of intensities obtained from the imaging plates and the MAR165. In addition, intensity/position plots (implots) can be displayed and printed out along any designated line. This is especially important as changes associated with Grade 1 tumours can be extremely weak and not apparent using other computer programs. Depending on the quality of the data, different methods available in both IRAF and MATLAB were used in the analysis. These included curve fitting which was extended to second order derivative plots to locate ill defined or weak peaks [20]. The background removal was achieved using one of the IRAF packages, BOXCAR, a standard mathematical boxcar data smoothing procedure. Different box-sizes were used depending on the overall distribution of the particular patterns or over sections of a pattern. A detailed description of this process is given in [4]., 16526=Cancers 2010, 2(2), 1155-1165; doi:10.3390/cancers2021155, 76940=\u00a9 2010 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.
