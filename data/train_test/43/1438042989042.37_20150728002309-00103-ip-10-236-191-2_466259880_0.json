            "What's Changed:",
            "Loan Prospector Outreach will accept submissions with negative income at the borrower level \u2013 for example from self-employed borrowers. This means you no longer need to enter a borrower's losses as modified income for a different borrower. This change helps with accurate reporting of borrower income and improved borrower-specific income messaging from Loan Prospector Outreach.",
            "Loan Prospector Outreach will accept submissions with no reported assets \u2013 for example, if the asset information wasn't provided on the loan application. This change allows the reported assets to be consistent with the loan application.",
            "Loan Prospector Outreach will accept submission of no cash-out refinances with cash-out amounts greater than zero. If the cash-out amount exceeds the Guide requirement that allows for a nominal cash-out amount (lesser of $2,000 or 2% of the loan amount), a feedback message will be returned that the Guide requirement hasn't been met. These changes allow additional Guide-compliant loans to be assessed in Loan Prospector Outreach.",
            "Loan Prospector Outreach will highlight data inconsistencies that may impact DTI and LTV ratios. Feedback messages will be provided if Homeowner Association dues aren't entered when expected for the following property types: planned unit developments (PUDs), condominiums, or cooperative share mortgages; or when there is a balance for subordinate financing but no related housing expense (or vice-versa). The feedback message alerts you to data inconsistencies, giving you the opportunity to take another look at the data.",
            "Loan Prospector Outreach will provide a new feedback message for loans with financed MI. The message will provide clarity on how Freddie Mac calculates LTV when there is financed MI on the loan.",
            "Loan Prospector Outreach will provide a feedback message that highlights the subject property ARM qualifying principal, interest, taxes and insurance (PITI) used for DTI calculations for all mortgages. We are also revising an existing feedback message to remove the two-digit rounding feature on ARM qualifying rates. This change expands the display of the ARM qualifying rate to three decimal places for ARMs with an initial adjustment period of five years or less."
