The much publicized race between Dan Liljenquist and Orrin Hatch was not, in the end, close. The senior senator will run for another term. Liljenquist issued his statement of congratulations and assurance of support earlier this evening. It is no surprise that Mitt Romney took the Republication nomination for the U.S. presidential race. At the bottom of the pile in that race in Utah was Fred Karger who, despite his last ditch\u00a0three-week campaign push in Utah \u2013 which focused more on a gay rights agenda than pursuit of the U.S. Presidency \u2013 garnered only 0.25 percent of the vote. Voter turnout was low. Votes cast from Southern Utah, reported thus far, were 5,548 for Iron County and 14,279 for Washington County. ST.
