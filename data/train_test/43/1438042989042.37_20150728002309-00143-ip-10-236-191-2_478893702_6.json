Accordingly, the scope of patented subject matter should not be limited to any of the specific exemplary teachings discussed, but is instead defined by the following claims. Advantageously, by implementing timer values appropriate for the type of application being notified, rather than using a single timer value for all applications, a more efficient and effective service can be provided to both the operator and the subscriber. In addition, by utilizing a central control node to control the notification and initiation of services, a coordinated approach for handling messages and alerts in an orderly and sequential manner can be achieved. Furthermore, it should be noted that the system and method disclosed herein can be implemented within a cellular network or any other type of network, such as a fixed Public Switched Telephone Network, in which the SCP or a Service Switching Point (SSP) would serve as the control node, and the SCP or SSP would be notified when the subscriber becomes available. In the fixed PSTN, a subscriber may be unavailable, for example, when the subscriber's line is busy or when the subscriber has the phone off-hook. Following the time-out of the priority one timer 432 (step 550), the HLR 430 then scans the list 435 for more",
