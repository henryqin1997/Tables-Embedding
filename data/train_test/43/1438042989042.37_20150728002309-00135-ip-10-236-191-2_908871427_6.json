            "Since the University of Evansville is a very small school, campus security is great. They are always there if you need them, and if you were to ever feel unsafe, they are very willing to escort you to where you need to go.",
            "There are plenty of clubs on campus, and tons of activities. The student activity board (SAB) hosts many free events for students to go to and just have fun. There is even a few dances on campus every year.",
            "At the University of Evansville, there is something for everybody to do. Most people join clubs, such as the Venturing Crew, Medieval Society, Foreign language clubs, and many others also. If there are no clubs you are interested in, then if you can find a few people and an advisor, you can start your own club!",
            "The cafeteria is the main source of meals, especially for freshman or those who don't like to cook. You always get plenty of food to eat, and there is a good variety. For those that like to cook, there is a kitchen in every dorm, or if you just need a quick coffee, right next to the cafeteria is our coffee shop. Next to that is a small convenience store, which you can go to if you ever wanted to grab something quick from there.",
            "Living in a dorm is just part of college life. You get to know your roommate as the first person usually in your dorm, but soon after you get to know most of the people on your floor. The resident assistants who live on the same dorm floor as you will hold floor events to get to know your floor better, and are always there to help you if you have any concerns.",
            "Academics are very important at the University of Evansville. Since the classes are generally small, the professor can get to know you better, and is always willing to help with any problems you may have with the class.",
            "If there is a class that you might have a bit of trouble in, don't be afraid to talk to the professor. They are always willing to help, and if you would rather ask a student in your class, they are always happy to help. Your advisor is always there for you too, and can help you with almost anything.",
            "The University of Evansville is a very close-knit community. The small classes allow you to know your professors, and get any extra help that is needed. Everybody is very friendly, and always willing to help."

This fountain adds a peaceful atmosphere to the campus. Around this fountain are two concrete walls that explain the meaning behind this beautiful fountain., 150338=The University of Evansville just currently announced the Big Freeze. Starting next year, 2013, incoming freshmen's tuition will be frozen. What that means is, whatever tuition the students have currently will remain the same for the next four years of their college. So it is great for parents and students because they can save money for themselves., 168225=Sticker price is expensive (~$40K/year) but scholarships are generous and the Big Freeze (no changes in tuition for current and incoming 2013 freshmen) are a big help. Work-study as well as a few other on campus jobs are available., 253288=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 89862=Everyone here is obsessed with the Basketball team and Soccer team. There are many clubs to chose from, but be warned with a school of a little more than 2000, don't expect to have huge group activities., 147248=The University of Evansville is an amazing campus where students can feel very much at home. It is very personal and students have the chance to really connect with their peers and professors since the student-teacher ratio is 13:1, and every faculty member makes it a personal effort to make sure that every students succeeds.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students I would say everyone, really. Although, if you're looking to party your way through school, be forewarned that it's a dry campus! Also, there is a Greek pressence on campus. The fraternities are all right around the corner (literally). However, the sororities don't have any house; has to do with an old Indiana law that never got thrown out. But although there is a Greek pressence, it's certainly not the only thing on campus either. There's also a really strong international pressence, and some really great organizations to go along with that: International Student Club, I-House, and I-Pals. Honestly, there truly is something for everyone here. Tips for prospective students Go for a campus visit--during the school year. You need to be on the campus to truly get a feel for what life is like there. And don't be afraid to contact the admissions office if you have questions, either. They're always really helpful and really friendly. Bang for the buck Although UE is a wonderful place to be, it is expensive. $34,000 a year is a lot of money. Especially since it doesn't always seem like that money is going places that I would like it to. However, they are really great about trying to get you the greatest amount of aid as possible, which",
