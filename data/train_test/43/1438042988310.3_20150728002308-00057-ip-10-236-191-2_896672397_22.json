            "I have never felt any less than completely safe on campus. The security guards you check for decals at the enterances are very nice and I feel completely comfortable walking around campus after dark.",
            "There is ALWAYS something going on on campus. There are every kind og club and orginzation on campus and if you cannot find one you want you can make it yourself.",
            "Students who want a connection with their teachers and peers. CBU is a close knit community.",
            "On campus there is The Rock which is a boulder that anyone can spray paint to advertise their clubs or any news. I love that it is not regulated; anyone can decide to paint on it as long as it is appropriate.",
            "Christian Brothers is more than willing to award scholarships. Not only that, you recieve an amazing education here worth every penny, not only in the education you recieve but also in the connections and experiences.",
            "I love the food here. There are always a lot of options and if you cannot think or decide what you want the staff is willing to give you suggestions on what you can combine to make a delicious meal.",
            "I live in the LLC which I love. Having visited the other dorms I can say that they all are very nice and well kept. The staff in charge of room assignments try very hard to make sure that roommates and suitemates are compatable and they do a good job.",
            "The classes are taught so that you learn. If you are having trouble in any of your classes, the teachers are very willing to help out any way they can. The Professors who teach here teach because they want to, and this shows in the classroom.",
            "Apply, but if you get the oppertunity to come visit the campus take it. Once I got onto campus I knew that this was the school I wanted to attend.",
            "I love Christian Brothers. Out of all 13 colleges that I applied to and was accepted to Christian Brothers outshone all the rest by far. Everyone here is incredibly welcoming and nice, and being a long way from home it is nice to know that if I ever need the help it is here for me. The classes also have the academic standards that I wanted but the Professors are always willing to help."

They're just trying to survive Humans vs. Zombies., 73247=It was this really fun thing they started this year, the September of Services. It's basically the whole month of September and you volunteer all over the city of Memphis, and it's amazing. I swear you'll love it!, 109402=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 47076=You cannot stay anonymous on this campus; all your professors will know you and call you out. If you don't want small classes with teachers that work one-on-one then you need a bigger school. However, if you like being able to get to know everyone on campus and want the extra attention from your professor than CBU would be a great place for you. The food isn't perfect and right now we don't have a fitness center but in the spring of 2013 the Kroc Center (an all-purpose sport facility with a pool, water-slide, and indoor and outdoor sports fields among other things) will be opening across the street. Students will have memberships to while they attend CBU.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Yes, the tuition may be a little high, but for the small class sizes, great staff and faculty, and a beautiful campus to learn and study, I'll pay that much for school. CBU has a very comfortable environment and fits my learning styles and preferences perfectly. Am enjoying being here Here at CBU, there is enough going on for the residents and commuters to interact and hang out. There is usually a community Mass on campus where everyone of different faiths can come and get a little prayer if they need it. The Greek life on campus is very active, but appropriate in the way that they do not interfere with classes or studies. From what I have noticed, parties are usually during the weekends or breaks, so you are not falling into your Monday class hung over from the weekend. Am learning a lot My classes are small, meaning that if I have a question in class, my teacher will be able to answer it for me. Also, your teachers WILL know your name, unlike bigger schools with 200 students in a lecture hall. The work load is of medium difficulty, but it is nothing a little studying cannot fix.",
