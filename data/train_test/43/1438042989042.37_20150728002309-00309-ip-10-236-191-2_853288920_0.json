    "textBeforeTable": "Achievements We've noted every Target Mark location throughout the walkthrough for the \"Normal\" difficulty level, but you're on your own for the remainders. Thankfully, the \"easy\" ones are generally out in the open and can usually be spotted as you traverse the level. However, for the \"hard\" and \"extreme\" levels, be sure to check every corner of every room, as they are deviously hidden. Target Marks Within each level lies several circular targets with a letter engraved on them. Finding them all in each level will earn you an achievement. Unfortunately, that's the only thing you obtain by collecting them. Even worse, the set of target marks is\u00a0located in different parts of the level for each of the four difficulty levels, which means you're going to have to play through the game four times if you want to find them all.
