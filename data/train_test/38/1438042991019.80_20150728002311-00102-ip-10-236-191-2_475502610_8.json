    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations By reversing the anode and cathode connections of the zener diode structure 11, the zener diode 31' becomes reversed biased and the zener diode 23' becomes forward biased. The zener diode 31' has a higher zener breakdown voltage than the zener diode 23' because of the lower doping density at the breakdown junction 31. While, in this case, the zener diode 31' has a larger temperature coefficient, substantial temperature compensation is still obtainable. With this arrangement, that is, by reversing the anode and cathode connections, a higher overall zener voltage is achieved for the zener diode structure 11. A further advantage of this structure is that the two opposing zener diodes 23' and 31' may be arranged so that the zener diode 31' offsets a substantial portion of the breakdown voltage increase or decrease which commonly occurs in the zener diode 23' due to variations in operating temperature of the device. This occurs because the zener diode 23' has a positive temperature coefficient, that is, its breakdown voltage increases with increasing temperature, and the zener diode 31' being used in its forward biased mode, has a negative temperature coefficient. By a suitable choice of doping levels, it is possible to achieve temperature compensation to a significant degree by the resulting reduction in the positive temperature coefficient of the zener diode 23'. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the two zener breakdown",
