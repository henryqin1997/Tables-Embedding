            "UNA has many options for having fun on campus! UNA has an amazing REC center where a student can get a great work out or dance and have a good time. UNA also has an amazing homecoming week where everyone can get involved! A student can't walk around UNA without winning a free t-shirt or other items!",
            "UNA's food and dining on campus is very good, and students have many options. The university makes sure they provide food for vegetarians, vegans, and many other life style. Whenever you are hungry there is always an option on campus within walking distance.",
            "The dorm life on this campus is great because you are so close to campus! However, the rooms are not the best, they are very tiny and pact. It is easy to over come this because the dorm life is so much fun. The staff always makes sure everyone is always involved in activities. There is never a dull momment in the dorms.",
            "This university, like any other, can have its harder courses, but it's those courses that make students work harder and better themselves. There is no such thing as an easy A here, and A is earned not given. As long as a student always trys hard and does his/her work they will do great at this university.",
            "Getting involved on campus is a major much if you are a new student. College is a time to try new things, maybe join a club that you didn't do in high school. This college has so many clubs and organizations that it is hard not to get involved!",
            "The University of North Alabama is an amazing school, it may not be the largest school but it is still amazing. The university has everything you could ever want and more. If you enjoy the small town but big school feeling you will love this school."

Reviewer has been to campus. 5 out of 5 people found this review useful. 2 of 50 Categories Comments Bang for the buck Although the town is small, the campus nice. It is safe campus and tuition is not very high. Will enjoy being here The town is very small town. The mall is very small as well. Finding things to do will be hard if you don't know anyone there. Will learn a lot The classrooms are small, so that means that you may be able to get more assistance from your teacher. I can't be curtain because I have not had the chance to sit in a classroom while a teacher was lecturing. Login to rate or flag the reviews From Atlanta, GA",
