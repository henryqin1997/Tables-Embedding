The song starts off with a wedding proposal, but rather than turn towards a cheesy ode to marriage, or a clich\u00e9d tale of abandonment at the alter, Strait leads the song into a heartbreaking exchange between two grown-ups. Lead On proves again that Strait can please the masses without resorting to juvenilia. The title track is a fireside ballad for longtime lovers, and \u201cNobody Has To Get Hurt\u201d might be the most sincere plea for a second chance a country singer has ever delivered. To mix it up \u201cAdalida\u201d and \u201cDown Louisiana Way\u201d partake in some Cajun flavors, while \u201cI Met A friend of Yours Today\u201d is a graceful bar floor tearjerker. Still, the character in which Strait specializes is the spurned lover still faithfully waiting on his former flame. Thus, from the breakups of \u201cWhat Am I Waiting For,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll Always Be Loving You,\u201d and \u201cNo One But You\u201d come some of Strait\u2019s most devoted expressions of romantic longing., 123097=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
