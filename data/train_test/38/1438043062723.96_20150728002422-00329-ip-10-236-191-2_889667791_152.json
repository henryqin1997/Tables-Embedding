            "Tons of people go to the gym, go to the mall, take the bus to Springfield, and get together to have fun. A popular thing here at the University is greek life, it's a great way to get involved and to meet tons of new people that could potentially become your best friends.",
            "Food given at the University is very good, but after a while students tend to miss homemade food given to them. Not needing to be paid for and what not. Yet the dining is well offered and variety is definitely offered at the different dining halls.",
            "When attending the University, there are a lot of people from different places and it will give incoming students a chance to meet new people who come from different backgrounds.",
            "Class are challenging at the University and I personally recommend going to tutoring as often as possible.",
            "The change of high school and college is completely different, start studying hard and attend tutoring. Remember everyone needs help sometimes and it's totally normal to struggle. Have an open mind because there is going to be a lot of people that don't have a lot in common with you.",
            "The University of Oregon has had awesome students that are from all over. It's welcoming atmosphere allows us students to enjoy our experience. Attending this University will benefit me in the future for my own success."

The school spirit, the excessive friendliness emanating from people on every corner, how much there was to do and get involved in and the academic rigor they portrayed. Also, the campus is absolutely beautiful, and there seems like something to do for everyone, and there's no one specific stereotype at the U of O., 53173=Get your FAFSA in on time and if you are coming from a different state make sure you get it in by March 1st.

Am enjoying being here Eugene is a wonderful place to start your life. It is a very nice community and a great college town.
