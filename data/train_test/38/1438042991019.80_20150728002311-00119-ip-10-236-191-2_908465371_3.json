            "It's a great Engineering school with a lot of knowledgeable professors that will help you reach your goals. Also their are a lot of upper class man that you can go to get help from.",
            "Guided tours are great because they show you everything but also they are only showing you the good stuff. Stop a couple of students on campus ask them their major, what they like and dislike about the school, and any other questions you might have. Don't be afraid to ask most students really enjoy Tech and would be more than willing to answer a question. Oh and don't let the dorms scare you, its a small space but it works.",
            "I feel like I am making a great investment in my future by going here. I'm getting a quality education that is not draining the bank as much as if I was going to a bigger University.",
            "I enjoy the small town feel of Tech. It's safe and cops are always patrolling so I don't have to be as nervous about walking over to the library at night. Also the campus is small so if I am running late for that 8 o'clock class I can get there in five minutes.",
            "Teachers really want you to have the best possible education that you can have here. Some teacher even bend over backwards to help you either understand the material or do better on assignments."
