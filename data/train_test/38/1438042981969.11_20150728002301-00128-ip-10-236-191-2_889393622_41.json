            "For the basic, general ed courses, all you need to do is show up and have half a brain (or less). For the higher maths and sciences, these are no BS cources that you NEED to have your ducks in a row, and you NEED to be on top of your course work because it WILL kick your butt. Professors who teach those classes often taught at high up universities so their classes are just like what you would be taking at a UC. Know your stuff.",
            "Have a plan, get in and get out, do not waste time at COD. COD is a stepping stone, not a destination. Transfer opportunities are excellent make sure you review all your options.",
            "College of the Desert is a great option if you want to figure out what your next step is while earning some college credits, maybe you'll get your associates while you're there. It's not the best, in anything, academics, student life, counseling or anything, there is no prestige here. But if you work hard and do well you will probably get a reference letter from a has been professor for a top university."

It's nursing department is widely known and appreciated, and has strong ties to the Cal State San Bernadino campus that is five minutes away. Any other vocational degrees, such as culinary arts, auto repair, management and hospitality, and general maintenance certification are easily available with quality instruction. This should not discourage students planning to transfer though, as College of the Desert's programs for Art, Graphic Design, Philosophy, and Liberal Arts are extremely commendable as well. Tips for prospective students Make sure to register in advance in order to get into the classes you need. It also helps to have a 2-year game plan outlining what classes you need (and want) to take in order to achieve your goals, and the best",
