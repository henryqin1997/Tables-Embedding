Note that the Table is meant as a quick reference to determine which variables are available. The README file contains more complete descriptions for each variable. Determine Which Variables you Wish to Customize These steps are discussed in more detail below. Create a custom installation media. Create a customized configuration. Determine which variables you wish to customize. To create a custom installation, perform the following steps: /usr/sbin/pc-sysinstall this is the script that is used to perform a customized installation. /usr/share/examples/pc-sysinstall/ contains several example configuration files for different scenarios (e.g. upgrade, fbsd-netinstall). The README file in this directory should be considered as mandatory reading before using pc-sysinstall. /usr/share/pc-sysinstall/doc/ contains the help text that is seen if you run pc-sysinstall without any arguments. /usr/share/pc-sysinstall/conf/ contains the configuration file pc-sysinstall.conf. It also contains a file indicating which localizations are available (avail-langs), and a license/ subdirectory containing text files of applicable licenses (e.g. bsd-en.txt and nvidia-en.txt). /usr/share/pc-sysinstall/backend-query/ contains the scripts which are used by the installer to detect (e.g. detect-nics.sh) and configure (e.g. enable-net.sh) hardware. /usr/share/pc-sysinstall/backend-partmanager/ contains the scripts which are used by the installer to create and delete partitions.",
