You will be able to take a lot of different classes and have a chance to major in some really great programs. To give you an idea for a four year Bachelors of Nursing costs about $30,000. That is from day on to graduation. Where as an Associates in Nursing, which would still give you the title RN, will cost you about $12000-$15000 from start to finish. That goes the same form some of the other programs as well., 227253=In the month of November our school has an annual event (Harvest of Health) in which students from diverse programs offered at school.

They are a big help and available at any time throughout the semester but are constantly overlooked by students. Bang for the buck The average cost for classes is affordable as well as cost of supplies and textbooks. There are always students willing to help with book purchasing such as reselling books. The cafeteria on campus provides good food at a good costs and the student services available through tuition costs are a big help and definitely worth the price. Am enjoying being here There are friendly student clubs and plenty fun activities that take place throughout the semester. The student activities center always goes out of their way to bring a fun atmosphere out in between classes with games, music, and free food. Am learning a lot The instructors here are always eager to help students out in any way possible within reason.
