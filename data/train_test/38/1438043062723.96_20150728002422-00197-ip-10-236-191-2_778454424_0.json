Would they once again suffer the perils of chasing past returns?, 16423=NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- At the end of 2013, investors were unwittingly taking part in an interesting behavioral experiment with respect to recency bias. Most are familiar with the concept: It is the innate tendency for humans to project the recent past into the future. In the investment world, this means expecting the most recent performance of a security will continue indefinitely going forward. In simple terms, it is the belief that whatever was performing the best will continue to outperform and whatever was performing the worst will continue to underperform., 15036=The answer, of course, was a resounding yes. At the end of 2013 we saw inflows into U.S. equity funds at the fastest pace since 2000 and outflows from bond funds at the fastest pace in years. We also saw extreme bullish sentiment on U.S. equities and bearish sentiment on virtually everything else. Investors were indeed betting that 2014 would be an exact replica of 2013., 14110=Overall, there is a negative correlation of -.78 between the return of an asset class in 2013 and its return in 2014. Bitcoin is the most dramatic example of this reversal of fortune with a -47% decline this year, following a 5866% parabolic advance last year. In the opposite direction the junior gold miners, as seen by the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (GDXJ) have shown the most notable turnaround, up 41% this year after suffering a -61% decline last year.\u00a0, 10743=Access the tool that DOMINATES the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500., 15773=As we know now, 2013 was a highly abnormal year in the markets where U.S. equities outpaced every other asset class by a wide margin (with the exception of bitcoin). U.S. equities also did so with unusually low volatility and a nearly straight-up advance seen only a few times in history., 14441=In the first month and a half, we have seen the results of this bet. Nearly every asset class that underperformed U.S. equities in 2013 is outperforming in 2014 (see table below).}",
