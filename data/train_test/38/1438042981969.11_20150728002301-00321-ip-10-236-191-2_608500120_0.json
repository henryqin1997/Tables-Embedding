I've never ordered a used game off the website before, and it isn't in any stores near me, was wondering how that works. Original box and booklet i would prefer what do you think the chances are of that? and if its all scratched up can I return it in the local store or what? thanks for the help.",

If you want more specifics on what you get and the condition of it all, you'll need to buy from Amazon or eBay where you can find out what condition everything is in.",

            "8. Posted: Sun 8th Nov 2009 17:16 GMT @Westerhive As if they don't have a return policy for defective games. That's ridiculous. Game+Stop wrote: Items may be returned by taking them to a GameStop store location in the United States. Items returned to a GameStop store location must be accompanied by the original packing list. Store return policies may vary and are subject to manager approval. Check with your store first to see what their policies are, but if the policies at your local store do not cover this, you can always return it online. Not to mention it says under each pre-owned item that it is \"guaranteed to work.\" In my experience, this guarantee has always been reliable, and if it weren't, they'd be legally responsible for making false claims.

            "10. Posted: Sun 8th Nov 2009 17:24 GMT Well, the point was that if you advertise \"guaranteed to work\" and it does not in fact work, you would be legally responsible to remedy the situation, not that they are vendors of perfect used games. That sounds like a good plan though. The game is worth the effort. Without a doubt one of the best shooters ever, and if you are a fan of the genre at all, it's one of those games you have to play just so you know what everyone else is going on about.

I mean, you're trusting a completely random user (sure, there's feedback ratings, but it's really just a general gauge of trustworthiness, not a guarantee of any sort) instead of a major corporation that has much more legal responsibility. Or did you mean something else? Just curious. I must say I prefer auction sites, too, though, just for different reasons. You tend to get better prices on Ebay, though the price of Ikaruga seems unlikely to be much lower than this.",

I've ordered new games from their website just not a used game ever.So I'm a little hesitant. that and having to pay shipping... I've got $44 store credit and I would still get the 10% off though.... so like $2.80 off that might cover shipping. Edited on Sun 8th November, 2009 @ 19:17 by vampirelich",
