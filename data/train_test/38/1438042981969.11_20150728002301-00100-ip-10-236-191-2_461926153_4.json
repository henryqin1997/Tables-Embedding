The headbands contain the personal testimony of the suicide bombers.\", 30218=Not in the least: Politicians and public officials speaking at the upcoming event include Andrew Slaughter MP, the shadow Justice Minister; Sadiq Khan, the Shadow Secretary of State for Justice; Lord Falconer of Thoroton QC, a Labour Peer; Simon Hughes MP, deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats; Khurshid Drabu, a senior immigration Judge; and Shahid Malik, former Minister for International Development. Malik met with Hamas leaders in 2012., 19234=Farooq Murad, son of the \"Supreme leader\" of Bangladesh's violent jihadi group Jamaat-e-Islami, is also secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain. A report published by the Department for Communities and Local Government explicitly links the Muslim Council of Britain to Jamaat-e-Islami, which committed acts of genocide during the 1971 Bangladesh war of independence. Murad is also a trustee of the Islamic Foundation. In 2003, The Times reported that two Islamic Foundation trustees were on the UN sanctions list of people associated with the Taliban and al-Qaeda., 9073=\"Peace and unity...thanks be to Allah...a fantastic thing.\" \u2014 Simon Hughes MP, speaking to the Conference in 2008, 4569=by Samuel Westrop November 7, 2013 at 5:00 am, 54275=Copyright \u00a9 2015 Gatestone Institute.

(Image source: Harry's Place), 17024=By the time of the fifth Global Peace and Unity conference, there had been enough warning from counter-extremism activists for a few politicians to take note.

He claims the events are designed to \"promote dialogue, exchange ideas and information, and work towards dispelling misunderstandings surrounding the multiculturalism and co-existence of faiths.\", 14282=In 2008, the then-Labour Government deemed another conference, IslamExpo, to be beyond the pale, and banned its MPs from attending. This policy did not, at the time, receive total support from senior politicians.

In 2006, Badawi described suicide bombers as \"freedom fighters,\" similar to those fighting the Nazis or the Japanese kamikazes fighting the Americans.

He also condemned moderate Muslims who criticised Islamist terror groups., 26432=Abdul Wahid-Pedersen, a Danish Imam who has defended the stoning of adulterous women, and who founded the Independent Scandinavian Relief Agency in 1988 and served as its Secretary General until, however, in 2004, the Agency was closed down after its close affiliate was deemed by the U.S. government to be part of Al Qaeda's funding network., 25356=Yisroel Dovid Weiss, a spokesman for the extremist sect Neturei Karta, who attended and spoke at Iran's Holocaust-denial conference in 2007.

Further, Bari has, in addition, defended the mosque's previous involvement with Anwar Al-Awlaki, the late Al Qaeda leader, whom the U.S. killed in Yemen with a drone strike., 26972=Muhammad Al Shareef, founder of the Al Maghrib Institute, pupils of which included the 2008 \"underwear bomber,\" Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab.
