            "There isn't very much crime. There are towers all around with push to call buttons in case of an emergency. Just be careful as there have been a few sexual assaults and maybe a few thefts, but it is rare.",

            "Engineers, education, and nursing students. Skier or snowboarders. People who like the outdoors.",
            "There is a heated duck pond where the ducks stay there all winter long which seems crazy considering how low the temps get here. There is a snow science major offered. Roskie hall is pretty odd - just saying.",
            "Living off campus is cheaper, but the classes definitely teach you well so you aren't wasting your money.",
            "Everyone in this town is pretty much a skier or a snowboarder. There is a mall, movie theater, bowling in the rec center, and all the hiking and outdoor activities you could ask for. Some people bring their hunting gear and go hunting. There are a few clubs to join as well.Feeding the ducks in the duck pond may take a few minutes off your hands. Sometimes it is hard to find things to do in this town though.",
            "There are several options and three different dining halls. There is always the main meal of the day, pizza, salad, and sandwiches. You can look up the menu on the school's website. Breakfast is good and the late nite bite is the best for when you get done with those late night classes or tests. They have special meals for vegans or those with other dietary needs. Somehow Hannon ended up having the best food, but it is still similar all around. Everyone has their own opinion and some days the food was better than other days.",
            "All of the RA's are nice and schedule fun activities. I lived in the Freshman Apartments and you really bond with your roomates. No matter what there will be pros and cons to dorm life, but I think this is the best way to get to know people. (I am currently living off campus as it is surprisingly much cheaper.)",
            "All of the classes challenge you. This is not to say that some classes aren't easier than others, but you can always count on having to put in some effort. High mathematics courses, Chemistry, Physics, and other science classes can be quite difficult as expected, but teachers are always there to help. There are SmartyCats who are tutors that you can sign up with for free to get extra help in any class.",
            "Don't procrastinate because it will not be like High School. Get help from SmartyCats tutoring if you need help or go to teacher's office hours. Get to know people through clubs or dorm life activities. Have fun! Don't tell people you are a Griz fan (rival school team) ->just a joke.",
            "Montana State University challenges you with vigorous programs. There will be snow and cold weather for the majority of time. It is a place to experience the outdoors."

Students run a 5k race in their underwear every November., 585210=If you love to ski/snowboard, and I mean REALLY love the snow, MSU is the place for you. In my first year here, there has been snow cover since november with temps in the -20s. Great, friendly people, and a great atmosphere for learning with lots of outlets for help in every class., 153188=Bring warm clothes! It's a lot colder starting in September than I would have imagined., 512599=If you like the outdoors, MSU is the place for you! Almost every one here rides a bike, skateboards, hikes, skis, snowboards, or all of the above! Also, MSU has a great engineering program, ranking very high in the US. There will also be a new business college in 2015 that focuses especially on those looking into entrepreneurship!, 543495=Get a good winter coat. Bozeman is sunny and beautiful all through september and most of october but after that the temperature drops rapidly, the snow flies, and the skiers come out of hibernation, 217645=There is an undies run in September where everyone goes running in their underwear even when it's snowing., 11810=If you are looking for great research or internship opportunities this is the place to be. Montana State is within the Nation's top tier for this! If you are a minority this would be a great place to go if interesting in the hard sciences, math, engineering, etc. But I would also like to add that with the past few years MSU lost about 9 million in funding. This is significant because programs across campus have been cut completely, some altered(budget cuts), some merged into other programs, and some may lose all funding in 2012., 20575=No doubt, I am learning a ton! The vacations are longer: Winter break is 17-Jan11 and summer starts May 5. Despite these relatively short semesters, the professors pile on the homework and I think that they truly care about theit students., 82463=They start placing people into the residence halls as soon as March so sign up early for housing in order to get the placement you want. Make sure to ask questions because everyone is willing to answer but they won't really double check to make sure everyone is doing fine. Talk to your professors.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here I love living in Bozeman. It's a great town and the campus is lovely, and it's really easy to find fun things to do. There's a lot of outdoor activities and fun places to explore and new things to try, and most people are very friendly. Am learning a lot My classes here are amazing. Most professors are really flexible with office hours and love to have students stop by, which is so great. They are such good resources to take advantage of. They also push you to your limits and make you really think about what you know and what you're learning, which makes it that much better.
