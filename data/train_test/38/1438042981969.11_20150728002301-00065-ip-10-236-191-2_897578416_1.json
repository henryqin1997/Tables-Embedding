            "Skidmore College is great for aspiring artists, musicians, dancers, and actors because it has a terrific arts program. But Skidmore College is also a great institution for future businessmen/businesswomen through its exceptional business program and business project with actual business executives. For future historians, politicians-diplomats, and teachers, Skidmore College has an outstanding government and history department and professors have great connections.",
            "Prospective students should look forward to challenging work, a great social life, and enhanced critical thinking should they decide to attend Skidmore College. Prospective students, when sending in their application and or doing an interview, need to emphasize their personal responsibility, social responsibility and commitment to social tolerance, open-mindedness, demonstrate a gracious personality, and remain confident. Prospective students should also convey their honesty. Finally, for those, who will need financial aid, they need to work and save their money and search for scholarships because the college life is not cheap.",
            "Skidmore College is an expensive institution, but people are getting their money\u2019s worth because the education is excellent. According to the college, it costs $63,000 to educate each student, but the tuition is a little over $52,000. There is state of the art technology in business and science building and services are great and well funded. Classes are generally comfortable and small and the environment is well maintained.",
            "Most students enjoy being at Skidmore College because they find multiple ways of entertainment, such as going to on or off-campus parties, joining campus groups or clubs, participating in different choirs and acapella groups, socializing in the dining hall or the dorms. Students also enjoy being on campus because of the freedom from direct parental control and the freedom to express their individuality.",
            "One can learn a great deal at Skidmore College because the classes are designed to enhance critical thinking and social awareness. Students are encouraged to ask many questions in class discussions and in lectures. Most professors assign research projects and ask one of the several librarians to lecture their class on how to properly use the library database to search for sources, instead of using Google for sophisticated, college-level research. Lectures generally consist of 45 students, with small discussion groups. Furthermore, there exists an 8 to 1 student to staff ratio and the staff is almost always available to assist students who have difficulties in a specific subject."

The urgent notification system is great at emailing and texting students when something is going on around campus that requires immediate attention. They are all incredibly kind people that don't want to bust people, just want to keep them safe. They allow you to enjoy your college experience, but everyone's safety is their number one concern. I find them to be the most fair people I have ever met, and they are very understanding. Greek Life None! No hazing, no huge parties. Safe and quiet. Clubs and Activities Skidmore offers many Division 3 sports. There are clubs for everything. Pride Alliance for the LGBTQ community, BARE, the sex forum, SGA the Student Government Association, Christian Fellowship, Hillel, and so on. There are clubs",
