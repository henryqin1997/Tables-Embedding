Accordingly, the present invention should be limited only by the spirit and scope of the appended claims. As used herein, the term \"lower extremity\" should be interpreted broadly to include the foot, the ankle, and the lower leg. Finally, it will be observed that the width of base member 14 and the spacing between the shell members 12a, 12b may be adjusted to fit lower extremities of varying size by peeling back the lower portion of each airbag 28a, 28b, releasing the attachment between distal portions 18a, 18b of hinge portions 16a, 16b and VELCRO fasteners 24a, 24b, and reattaching as desired. Furthermore, it will be appreciated that the provision of filler members 48a, 48b as disclosed in the present specification simplifies applying or fitting the ankle brace 10 about the lower extremity. Thus, after positioning the lower extremity between the shell members 12a, 12b with the heel of the foot resting upon base member 14, and putting on and lacing the shoe to be worn with the ankle brace, all that is necessary is to squeeze or flex the shell members toward each other with one hand until they are in snug supporting engagement with the ankle and lower leg, while with the other hand, each fastener strap 38a, 38b is circumferentially drawn and tensioned about both shell",
