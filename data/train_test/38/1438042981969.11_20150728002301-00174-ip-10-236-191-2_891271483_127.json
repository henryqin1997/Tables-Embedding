            "There is always something going on on this campus whether it be a 'Miller Movie' (which is a recently released movie show on a big screen in the campus auditorium for $1) or a blacklight party for Residence Housing Association. It is hard not to find something to do on campus. Or off for that matter.",
            "The food is food. The cafeteria hours on the weekend are a little annoying but a student can normally find food available at most times during the day. It is cafeteria food and there are dishes that many students and many students hate. I personally don't mind the cafeteria if only because I don't have to worry about making my own food when I get home from a long day at class and work. The cafeteria is almost always clean as well",
            "Again I a a little bit bias. I have lived in the residence halls for 3 years now and it has truly been one of the best experiences of my life. It is so easy to find friends and classmates close by when you live on campus. Especially if a student lives in Special Interest Housing like First Year experience, Wellness (substance free living), and Business community.",
            "I would say it probably depends on your program but I know that most of the health and education majors have a pretty rigorous academic plan which they have to follow.",
            "I would recommend that every student lives on campus once. I am an RA so I suppose you could say I am bias but at the same time living on campus, especially if a student 'goes in blind', teaches the student how to deal with conflict best and how to work and interact with other people more.",
            "I absolutely Love Western. I have made a home here and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place away from home."

May be a little hot when you first get here. NO AC., 484718=There is so much. Go to sporting events is one way or participate in some of the Student Organizations. There are also numerous events that the Campus Activities Board puts together each year, including several a month. These events range from concerts to movies. Miller Auditorium also has great shows and concerts every year in which students get 50% of tickets. Students can exercise at the Rec Center or Ice Skate and Swim at Lawson. There is also always Bronco BASH in September., 28857=WMU has been name one of the top schools in 2011 already! You can look up facts about the school and they are all true. We have a great College of Aviation and also Business College. WMU is for someone that is sociable and if not you will turn into one. It's for a student that loves to be interactive. This is a place for someone that will represent their university with pride. If you have great heart and spirit come to WMU because it's always a great day to be a BRONCO!, 268577=There are vehicles starting at 9:00 that you can call to pick you up where ever you may be on campus and take you to the location you desire around the campus for your safety. Also there are 911 stands everywhere so that if you get in trouble you can always push the button and get help where ever you may need it., 4860=I'm a physics student, but I've found philosophy and chemistry to be strong areas in this college. I haven't experienced much in my one semester here, but Chem 1100, 1110, Philosophy of Science (honors), and music appreciation to be well worth while., 564162=One big tradition that we have here at Western is called Bronco Bash!! this happens every year during like the first week of September where all different types of school clubs/organizations as well as businesses , restaurants etc. comes on campus to promote their business and/or organizations and gives away a lot of FREE stuff!!, 52248=The overall tuition ranks fairly low compared to the rest of the public University's in Michigan. Last I checked it was 13th out of 15th in terms of the highest priced as of 2008 (1st being the most expensive). Also, it is ranked as one of the top public University's year after year according to US News. So, it really is a great deal, but my only complaint is that although tuition is low, living on campus is expensive with a lot of nickel and dime fees that can annoy you (parking passes, Wired internet fees, mini fridge rentals, etc.), however as a freshmen you don't have to live on campus, and is something to consider based on your financial situation., 900558=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

I haven't experienced much in my one semester here, but Chem 1100, 1110, Philosophy of Science (honors), and music appreciation to be well worth while. Tips for prospective students I wouldn't recommend the unlimited food plan, my roommate and I are having trouble justifying the cost of having it, and realistically the 3-a-day has been better. Also stay on the good side of the R.A.'s on campus, they'll become good friends to have later on. Bang for the buck Going here actually ended up being less than I had expected, the living conditions have been better than anticipated (good roommate helps), classes have been well put together and fulfilling, and I find that the food is good. Am enjoying being here",
