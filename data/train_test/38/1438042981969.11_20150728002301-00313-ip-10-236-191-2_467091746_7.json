This means that the artificial intervertebral disc B of the invention already shows a certain increase in the starting stiffness which is different to zero at any desired small compression force F and thus at any desired small stresses, with stiffness (or starting stiffness) of the artificial intervertebral disc at a compression force F being understood as the corresponding increase in the curve D 1 or D2 in the force-path diagram with a deformation path S which is associated with the corresponding compression force F. The intervertebral disc of the invention thus shows a preferred stiffness between 2000 N/mm and 20,000 ; N/mm at a compression force F of 3000 N and a stiffness whose value is lower than 500 N/mm under a deformation S of approximately 0.4 mm.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Referenced by [0037] An artificial intervertebral disc B is provided by the invention which for a plurality of reasons is very well suited as an implant and thus as a replacement for a natural intervertebral disc. In its embodiment as a one-part implant, which is made up of only a few components, the artificial intervertebral disc of the invention can be introduced in a simple manner into the human spinal column. It can be supplied prefabricated and sterilised for a corresponding surgical procedure so that complex techniques for the putting together of single parts during a surgical procedure inside the human body or between two vertebral bodies W become superfluous. The distraction of the vertebral bodies W for the introduction of an intervertebral disc prosthesis is a task which generally represents a substantial problem due to the tight space relationships. If, for example, a dehydrated hydrogel is used as the core material for the nucleus 3, the artificial intervertebral disc B has a build height H at the time of introduction into the spinal column which is up to 50% lower in the dehydrated state than in the fully hydrated state. The problems in connection with the distraction are thereby substantially reduced. Due to the special design of the fibre ring 5, to the interaction of the nucleus 3 and the fibre ring 5 and to a suitable choice of the materials, the elastic behaviour of",
