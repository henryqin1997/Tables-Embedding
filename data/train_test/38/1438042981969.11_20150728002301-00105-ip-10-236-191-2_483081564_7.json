The format switch 41 may incorporate a variable codec for analog lines AL1-ALN and digital lines DL1-DLN. For analog lines, a video CODEC along with computing capability may take the form of an AVP1000 video CODEC chip set as available from AT&T. Essentially, the CODEC chip set accomplishes videophone operation and consists of a video encoder, a video decoder and an internal system controller. The format switch unit 41 is shown as coupled between a standard analog line and a line on ISDN. Upon receiving a call from a videophone unit, the format switch unit 41 selects the appropriate line, that is, the analog line. Alternatively, upon receiving a call from a high fidelity video (digital), the format switch unit 41 selects a digital line. Also, as described above, during visual communication (real-time), a buyer may make switches, e.g., from transmitting dynamic images over a single analog line to high resolution freeze frames. The high resolution freeze frames may be viewed on large 14 inch monitors. Further, the images may be manipulated from either end, to view the freeze frame image concurrently.}",

Further assume that the calling vendor is associated only with hair products (Chart A, code 472000). However, assume that the caller identifies the \u201cmerchandise of interest\u201d to be a water resistant sun skin product, code 471234. Thus, the identified merchandise code does not coincide with the caller's registered merchandise code. In such a case, the processing is halted with the consequence that the call is either terminated or transferred to an operator. At this stage, likely operation would involve referring the call to an operator. Thus, the qualification unit T28 concludes the test by assuring that the entity being represented by a call is authorized for access with respect to the identified codes., 85899=This application is a divisional of application Ser.

The subject matter in all the above-identified co-pending and commonly owned applications is incorporated herein by reference., 115538=Furthermore, in some cases, a summary of each buyer's efficiency may be recorded and provided to interested parties. For example, a buyer's efficiency may be ascertained by the number of video calls made by a specific buyer every week, the average length of the video call, and other data displayed from the database, namely, name of the vendor, names of the persons participating in the call, and so on. For example, for a particular buyer a summary could indicate that during the week of Mar. 20, 1993, forty calls were made for an average length of twenty minutes. Detailed information may further indicate that specifically at 10:00 a.m., on Mar. 20, 1993, a first appointment with Mr. John Blow, of ABC Fruit Company was initiated, which lasted for 1 hour and 12 minutes, and at 11:12 a.m., a second appointment with Ms. Mary Smith of XYZ Cutlery Company lasted 11 minutes and so on., 128704=The videophone terminal VP1 may be a unit available from AT&T, such as the Videophone 2500, or one available from MCI. A form of the digital video system VD1, for example, the NCR PVS-70 system also is available from AT&T/NCR and is recognized to provide high quality images. A static video system VS1 may be AT&T's PICASSO\u2122 still image phone, which transmits \u201cpicture perfect\u201d still color images and voice simultaneously in just a matter of seconds. By pushing a button on the PICASSO\u2122 phone, a still image for a camcorder or electronic camera may be captured and, by pushing another button, that picture may be transmitted to another PICASSO\u2122 phone. Such a video static system connects to standard analog telephone lines and is compatible with a wide range of video technology used in daily communication and industry standard camcorders, electronic cameras, mouse devices, document scanners and photo CD players. Accordingly, full-color images, virtually of any type, size or dimension may be transmitted for display on a TV, LCD panel, PC monitor or video monitor. Images may be stored or printed using a PC interface.}",

As indicated above, the disclosed embodiments afford some arrangements; however, the scope hereof should not so confined, rather the scope hereof should be in accordance with the claims as set forth below. Following receipt of a request for proposal, interested vendors may submit a video presentation as described above. Alternatively, vendors may be invited to call for an appointment or otherwise communicate their proposals to buyers. Thus, the system affords considerable flexibility in selectively communicating product information between buyers and sellers using video formats. may be transmitted to the buyer from the central traffic control system TIS. Note that a check digit may be supplied. Likewise, vendors may access blank forms, similar to the exemplary buyer request forms, to indicate special offerings. FIG. 10 illustrates an exemplary buyer request form providing specific information of the merchandise. Blank forms may be stored in a forms directory (e.g. menu-driven) or the like on each buyers terminal. Thus, when making a request for proposals, a buyer may simply access a blank form and enter the specific information.
