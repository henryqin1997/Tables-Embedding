Also related is U.K. Patent Application No. 2,238,681 dated May 6, 1991., 19124=Various video conferencing techniques have been utilized in the past to provide full frame video of participants for the video conference, most usually with each of the participants represented at a window on the terminal or display device utilized. What all of the prior video conference systems have in common is that it is necessary to provide full frame video which is bandwidth intensive and, inter alia, does not permit the participants to alter their image which is displayed to other participants. One such video conferencing system by K. Hiratsuka and H. Kakihara entitled Video Conferencing System Japan Telecommunications Review, Vol. 18, No. 3, pp. 145-151, July 1976, utilizes full frame video and accommodates large numbers of conferees by dividing up each scene into different segments with each segment filmed by different cameras. The purpose of dividing up the scene into segments is to be able to portray conferees large enough to be recognized, noting that if all the conferees were pictured, the faces would be too small to be recognized. A similar system is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 3,601,530 issued to Robert C. Edson et al., illustrating a video conferencing system using voice switched cameras, with the cameras dividing up the scene. Note that a video conferencing system corresponding to the aforementioned Japanese system is also published in the Proceedings of the IEEE, Vol. 73, No. 4, April 1985, authored by Hakar Sabri and Birendra Prasada.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Having above indicated a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it will occur to those skilled in the art that modifications and alternatives can be practiced within the spirit of the invention. It is accordingly intended to define the scope of the invention only as indicated in the following claims. Alternatively, there can be a preset scene in which by prearrangement the individuals are seated in a predetermined spatial relationship around a conference table. The conflict resolution for the predetermined placement must obviously take place prior to the scheduling of the meeting. In the above preferred system the user may be completely opaque to the meeting place meaning because his actual position and gestures can be masked or altered by virtue of there being no sensory input with respect to his presence at his particular computer terminal. This has the obvious advantage that unwanted gestures and positioning is eliminated vis-a-vis the scene presented to the participants. Moreover, the individual has the ability to place himself within the scene where he wants, subject to assent by the other participants. In short, this simplified animated electronic meeting place does not require position sensors of any kind or in fact cameras to ascertain the position of the individual. Of course, cameras can be utilized to ascertain what gestures the individual wishes to portray, although this can be controlled by a joy stick or other control provided to the user",
