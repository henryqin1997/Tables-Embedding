One proposed route is the use of so-called organic activators--usually organic compounds having one or more reactive acyl residues--which in solution react with the peroxide compound, e.g. sodium perborate, to form an organic peroxy-acid e.g. peroxyacetic acid, which is a more effective bleach at lower temperatures. Such bleach activators are described for example in a series of articles by Allan H. Gilbert in \"Detergent Age\", June 1967, pages 18-20, July 1967, August 1967, pages 26, 27 and 67., 18262=European Patent Application No. 82563 (published June 29, 1983) describes the use of manganese/carbonate mixtures., 23028=Preferred alkalimetal silicate is sodium silicate of which the Na2 O:SiO2 ratio may vary from 1:3.5 to 2:1, preferably from 1:2.6 to 1:1. Examples of suitable sodium silicate are sodium orthosilicate, sodium disilicate and the various alkaline sodium silicates., 21397=wherein x and y are integers of at least 6, the ratio of x to y being in the range of 1:1 to 1:2; and z is such that the bound water content is from 10% to 28% by weight., 19557=The optimum level of manganese (II) ions--Mn2+ --in the wash/bleach solution is dependent upon the formulation in which the manganese as bleach catalyst is applied. In terms of parts per million (ppm) of manganese (II) ions in the wash/bleach solution a suitable range will generally be from 0.1 to 50 ppm, preferably from 0.5-25 ppm.}",
