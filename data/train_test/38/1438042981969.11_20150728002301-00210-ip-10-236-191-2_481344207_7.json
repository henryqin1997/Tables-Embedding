FIG. 13 provides more detail for reference numeral 1105 of FIG. 11. At 1300 an IP address allocation request is received. At 1305, a determination is made regarding whether the high watermark has been exceeded. If the high watermark has been exceeded, at 1310 an additional subnet of a particular size is requested. At 1315, a summarized route for the requested subnet is inserted into the corresponding routing table. Regardless of whether the high watermark is exceeded, at 1320 the current subnet is set to the first assigned subnet. At 1325 a determination is made regarding whether the current subnet has an unused address. If all the IP addresses for the current subnet are allocated, the next assigned subnet is selected at 1330 and then examined at 1325. The process represented by reference numerals 1325 and 1330 continues until a subnet having an unused IP address is found. At 1335, an unused IP address is allocated from the subnet.}",

No. 09/874,520, filed Jun. 4, 2001 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,197,549 in the name of inventors Hussein Salama and Purnam Sheth, entitled \u201cOn-demand Address Pools\u201d, commonly assigned herewith., 98035=The local IP address pool 1000 also includes an increase increment size 1020 and a decrease increment size 1025. The increase increment size 1020 indicates the number of IP addresses to request when IP address utilization exceeds the high watermark 1005. The decrease increment size 1025 indicates the number of addresses to release when the IP address utilization falls below the low watermark 1010., 56875=Each service to which a user may be connected has an associated IP address space. That is, a certain range of addresses may address that space. The range may be contiguous, discontiguous, or a combination of both. For example, Corp A may have an intranet service having all IP addresses which start with \u201c10.1\u201d\u2014this may be denoted \u201c10.1.x.x\u201d where x can be any value between 0 and 255. It may also be denoted \u201c10.1.0.0; 255.255.0.0\u201d where \u201c10.1.0.0\u201d represents the IP address and \u201c255.255.0.0\u201d represents the subnet mask. Those of skill in the art will recognize that a 255 in the subnet mask field represents a binary 1111 1111 and amounts to a requirement that the corresponding field of the IP address must match bit for bit in order to achieve a match. On the other hand, a 0 in the subnet mask field represents a binary 0000 0000 and amounts to no requirement for any match. For example, a service having an address space of \u201c0.0.0.0; 0.0.0.0\u201d represents the Internet, i.e., all IP addresses are within this space. Note that since the subnet mask is 0.0.0.0 the IP address could be set to any value and it would yield the same result.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While embodiments and applications of this invention have been shown and described, it would be apparent to those skilled in the art having the benefit of this disclosure that many more modifications than mentioned above are possible without departing from the inventive concepts herein. The invention, therefore, is not to be restricted except in the spirit of the appended claims. Moreover, grouping allocated addresses in a relatively small number of subnets increases the probability of having a releasable subnet when utilization is low. The released subnet can then be assigned to another part of the network, allowing relatively efficient utilization of the available IP address space. Embodiments of the present invention have a number of advantages. Searching for a releasable subnet is simplified since allocating an IP address from earlier-assigned subnets means that releasable subnets tend to be one of the later-assigned subnets. Thus, searching for a releasable subnet beginning with the latest-assigned subnet reduces the number of subnets that need to be searched. Additionally, the same IP address allocation policy means that addresses tend to be allocated from relatively few subnets, thus allowing improved route summarization. , at 1600 the number of IP addresses allocated for each subnet assigned to the local pool is determined. At 1605 the subnet having the smallest number of allocated IP addresses is released. This subnet release method provides relatively efficient utilization of IP addresses because subnets",
