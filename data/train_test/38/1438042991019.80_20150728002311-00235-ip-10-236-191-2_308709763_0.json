Here, at the risk of demonstrating that I\u2019m not as wise as they, is my attempt at a theological response., 34454=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In our March 13 edition, a frequent letter-writer named David McLoughlin, wrote expressing skepticism about the Bible (Which Bible?) and who Jesus is. Then, in our May 13 edition, he noted that nobody responded to his previous letter and asked if that means there is no theological response., 29036=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On behalf of the Bedford County Ministerial Association I\u2019d like to thank Thaxton Baptist Church for holding a job fair on Friday, May 15. On that day representatives of 12 companies that are hiring met with 30 people who came looking for work. I have no idea of the results but I\u2019ll bet somebody who was unemployed on May 15 will be working soon, if not working already, as a result of that job fair. If so then every bit of work that went into that event was worth it.}",
