Dr. Church is also a member of the Genome Reference Consortium (GRC) an international consortium charged with improving the human, mouse, and zebrafish assemblies, and was an author on the two seminal manuscripts describing the human and mouse genome sequences. She has experience in molecular biology, genetics, genomics, bioinformatics, and is currently focusing on making genomic data more useful through large-scale annotation and comparative genomics. She graduated from the University of Virginia with a BA in Liberal Arts in 1990, and received her doctoral degree in the Biological Sciences at the University of California, Irvine in 1997.
