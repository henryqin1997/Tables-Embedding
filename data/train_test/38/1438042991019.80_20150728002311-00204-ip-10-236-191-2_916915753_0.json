If you are between sizes or need assistance selecting the proper size, please contact Customer Service Designer Born in Italy, Gabriella Cortese learned embroidery and dressmaking from her grandmother before moving to Paris to study art at age 18. Antik Batik was inspired by Cortese's travels and experiences: A job at the Crazy Horse in Paris revealed the sensuality of the body, Balinese artisans taught her the craft of Batik, and travels in India exposed her to exquisite hand-dyeing and embroidery techniques. With Cortese at the helm, Antik Batik is more than a fashion label, it's a lifestyle.
