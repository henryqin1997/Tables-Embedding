            "The campus is very very safe. Bearwalk is there to drive students back home late at night if they are still out and WarnMe is the emergency warning system that told us whether anything was wrong. It is quick and efficient and told us just seconds after an incident. We were the ones who knew first and that's how it should be.",
            "A lot of things up north in Berkeley are pretty cheap. The only concern is the rising tuition costs. Check out scholarships and work study jobs to try and pay it off. It's possible and will only give you a little more peace of mind.",
            "Check out clubs or events on campus. Go to karaoke. Participate in a dance workshop. Watch movie screenings. Attend concert performances. Eat eat eat well. Play assassins with your building. Get involved and have a great time!",
            "Food is okay at Berkeley. If you have a meal plan, there's an abundance of it, from the dining halls to the cafes. However, if you want to explore the town, food is great. There is such a large range of food types to enjoy so you'll definitely find a favorite restaurant and everything is easy to get to because we have bus passes. It's cheap and it stays open late and they are the perfect places to go to eat well.",
            "I absolutely love dorm life. That's where my home is. Get to know your floormates well because you have to live there. But it's more fun than that. We all go out for floor dinners, late night ice cream runs, movie screenings in our floor lounge, study groups and games. More importantly, get to know your RA and the people who dedicate their time to help you out, like your security monitors and PA and more. Don't disregard them. I found one of my best friends in my RA, I love my awkward PA, and I talk all the time with the security monitors. It just makes life a lot more fun. Don't be scared of the college bathrooms. They are not as dirty as people think they are. Set some ground rules with your roommates early. You want to get along with them, but it's not required to become best friends with them. Make it a comfortable environment where you can really do your best and enjoy.",
            "Berkeley is tough. Not so tough where you can't handle all of the work, but it will challenge you. Make a study group if you can and do all of the readings right when they are assigned because if you don't they will catch up to you and they are vital in some of the smaller discussions. Work hard and keep focused on what you want to get out of school.",
            "Study a lot and talk to your professors. It might be intimidating to go speak to your professor as casually as you did during high school, but attend office hours and email them, otherwise you'll quickly pass through their class as an unknown student. Take advantage of all of your resources and just have fun and explore.",
            "Berkeley is a hustle and bustle of activities. Every day something new is happening on the campus, whether it's club activities, games, protests, or tabling. It's always exciting to see what the school has to offer so definitely take advantage of everything out there."

A lot of it comes from the fact that it is in the bay area which is usually expensive to live in, but the quality of education here makes it worth it. There is a lot of financial aid available, so it is easy to come up with the money to pay for it. I'm paying about $1000 for the whole year out of pocket and it is definitely worth it, especially for being the number one public university in the world!, 698157=Holi happens every year in April on campus, it is a huge paint fight put on by the Indian Students Association. The lower plaza of campus become plastered with pink and purple. Of course don't forget the huge production of Big Game Week!!, 506096=My dream school since I was thirteen, and I through hard work I was accepted for the Spring 2013, 49183=Living 30 minutes outside of San Francisco certainly has its benefits. Fisherman's Whart, Alcatraz, Union Square, all a short BART trip away. Berkeley itself, however, can be low on the entertainment. There's a lot of places to eat, but not a lot to do. With a few hiking trails, sunny weekends can be put to good use, but considering that it rains most of the time, that option only exists for August/September., 931855=Best Cal tradition is definitely Berkeley Time. Basically, all classes start 10 minutes after the scheduled time. For example, 8 AMs don't actually begin until 8:10 (sometimes even later if you have a pretty chill professor). You could, theoretically, wake up at 8 for your 8 AM. Though I wouldn't suggest doing that for the first few days of class, especially if you don't know the campus very well., 160154=Berkeley offers a great selection of a variety of subjects -- you're sure to find something that you're interested in, and there are a lot of resources available even to people who are undecided. In fact, you're expected to take all sorts of classes! They truly want you to have a full education here, and not just march through a bunch of courses and come out with a diploma. Even in the large classes, professors are friendly and truly want you to be able to succeed., 918577=Get your SAT and GPA scores up! I scored a 2200 and am still nowhere near the top of their prospective class due to a somewhat subpar 3.85 GPA., 1066887=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 83811=Compared to private school tuition, the tuition at UC Berkeley is considerably affordable for in-state students. (Out-of-state pay 3 times as much as in-state.) That being said, tuition has doubled since I started college in 2009. These tuition hikes by the UC Regents have been causing a stir at all the UC campuses. Many of my lectures have 300-500 people and I have been one of 15 or 20 regulars at a professor\u2019s office hours (the average class size of some small liberal arts colleges). Dorm and apartment living is also pretty expensive, but I wouldn\u2019t expect much less living in the bay area. If you are willing to pay to be taught by some of the world\u2019s leading minds but do not necessarily care about a lot of one-on-one interaction with professors, then you won\u2019t be disappointed.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Students who are open-minded to all different types of people, students who want a large campus atmosphere, students who aren't bothered by crazy people with portable amplifiers talking about religion or global warming, students who want to get an amazing education in an amazing place, students who want great opportunities. But no matter if you are a crazy overachiever or just a normal student, Berkeley has everything for you. Just know that if you come here, you gotta study sometimes. So it's best for the people who know how to keep a balanced schedule. You are going to want to do a lot and being organized in prioritizing things helps keep you balanced. Tips for prospective students There are so many great things to know about Berkeley that you will experience on your own, but here is just a few things: - Your professors care about you. If you are unsure about things, be sure to go to their office hours and ask questions! You will stand out AND know the material better. Also, your professors are usually bored out of their minds in office hours. They HAVE to be there and no one ever walks in for help. - Berkeley is its own culture so there are certain abbreviations and slang that you will discover around the school. Asian Ghetto, Gourmet Ghetto, CARS, and VLSB are just a few",
