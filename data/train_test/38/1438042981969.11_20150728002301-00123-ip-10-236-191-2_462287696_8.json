It is the intent that the appended claims be interpreted as broadly as possible, in view of the prior art to include all such variations and modifications. Comparator CMPA is an input data comparator which senses the polarity of the VS1, VS2 signal and provides a polarity control POL, POL which is used to avoid phase errors by switching toggles V7A,B, V2C,D to maintain the same polarity being inputted into integrator V1B. This allows the measurement to start at any point of the input sine wave and still provide the desired integration. Integration is performed when line clock LCKO is true and is held when line clock LCKO is false. As described supra, during the hold period the integration data is processed by the other portions of the system. When the system goes into the run mode (state 4) signal SC4 is low setting counter U6 in a down count or decrement mode and also disabling gate U1, and enabling gate U2. In state 4 signal TCI is disabled so signal ZCK which generates TCI is fed to frequency divider U which divides its frequency by sixteen. The resultant lower clock signal ZCKlow frequency is fed through gates U2, U3 to counter U6 which decrements accumulated TCI counts at one",
