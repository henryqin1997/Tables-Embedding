You will learn to use art resources in the library and on the web, as well as develop critical evaluation skills. These assignments consist of three parts: 1. Find a work of art that interests you. You may accomplish this task by searching books in the library, going through your textbook, by going to a gallery, or by researching art and artists on the World Wide Web. You could even comment on a film or theatre performance you have seen, or architecture you may have observed. You should pick a piece that intrigues you, or one for which you have a strong emotional response. This response can be positive or negative. It is far easier to evaluate and comment about a work of art when you have a strong response to it than when you are ambivalent. Once you have found your image, you will need to make a copy to hand in along with the other parts of the assignment. (Obviously, this",
