The next time i called they told me i would have to pay $2000 a semester (and im not including loans and interest rates). so i was like what ever I'll take out a loan to pay it off. Later on the S, 127194=Students who may attend this campus should keep in mind that there are so many things that can prevent you from continuing a college degree. Things like finances, GPA, or even misfortunes that can not be resolved. I would like to express that my studies at Mercy has been a gratifying reward. The college has provided incentives, personal or private loans, and academic counselors to help with all transitions. I will be a graduating student in 2015 and will always be thankful for the support that the Mercy College staff of student services has provided in my path to a college degree., 89532=make sure you call mercy constantly with financial aid. At first they told me that i would only have to pay $500 out of pocket. The next time i called they told me i would have to pay $2000 a semester (and im not including loans and interest rates). so i was like what ever I'll take out a loan to pay it off. Later on the they send me papers i needed to fill in...and i did, and mailed it back to them, but 2 weeks after they still haven't received it, so i went to the college and gave it to them personally.....so they send me to financial aid office, and after 10-15 minutes they told me that they made it was a mistake and that i will now have to pay $4000 a semester. and im not even rich. my parents have a low income.so how can they expect me to pay that much. and i WAS going to do a semester there but then i thought: $4000 a semester + $4,500 on financial aid loans (not including interest) its just too much for a semester and if i would of went i would of been in debt., 204218=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 188710=I am planning to begin my Freshmen year in the Fall of 2014. The Dobbs, Ferry campus seems nice and convenient. However, I am going to the Bronx Campus and I love it! It feels great to be in a new environment., 168772=TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN & ALL FUTURE PROSPECTIVE PARENTS AS A PARENT I HAVE NEVER DEALT WITH A SCHOOL THAT IS SO DISORGANIZED AND CANT GET NOTHING TOGETHER. EVERY SINGLE SEMESTER THAT MY DAUGHTER ATTENDED I HAD TO PHYSICALLY GO IN TO FIX A PROBLEM (THAT NEVER GOT RESOLVED) SHE ALWAYS ATTENDED THE DOBBS FERRY CAMPUS BUT YET EVERYTHING GOES TO THE MANHATTAN CAMPUS, EVERY THING IS MIXED UP AND I AM TIRED OF IT. LAST WEEK I PHYSICALLY WENT IN AND SETTLED THINGS ON THE ACCOUNT, THEY SAID THINGS WOULD BE FIXED BY NOW, AND THEY ARE NOT SO THIS IS HOW THE ADVISER DECIDED TO SCAM US THIS TIME. I WENT IN AND PAID THE$ 4100 (THE CHECK CLEARED AND MY CREDIT CARD SHOWS IT WAS PAID TOO) THE ADVISER THEN TELLS ME THAT IF THE PARENT PLUS LOAN GETS DENIED THAN WE WOULD QUALIFY FOR THE OTHER MONEY I DON'T CARE WHERE BUT IT CAME UP TO $1978 THE BALANCE STILL OWED ON THE ACCOUNT. SO NOW THAT I SAID I DON'T WANT MY DAUGHTER TO ATTEND THEY NOW SAY I HAVE TO ATTEND TO GET THE FINANCIAL AIDE WTF SINCE WHEN DO YOU HAVE TO COMMIT TO TWO SEMESTERS TO GET FINANCIAL AID? WHERE ARE THE ADVISERS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEMESTER TO ADVISE PEOPLE THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEMESTER BUT ANYWAY I PAID WHAT I HAD TO PAY BUT NOW THERE IS STILL A BALANCE. SHE MUST ENROLL FOR CLASSES BUT THE BALANCE IS STILL THERE, NOW HERE IT IS THEY WANT TO LIFT THE HOLD SO I CAN REGISTER FOR CLASS BUT THE MONEY ISN'T THERE(THE REMAINDER OF THE BALANCE) THEY WANT ME TO INCUR MORE FEES SO I CAN CONTINUE TO BE IN DEBT TO MERCY COLLEGE IN THE 4 YEARS I ATTENDED SAINT PETER'S COLLEGE(NOW UNIVERSITY) I NEVER DEALT WITH THIS EXCUSE MY FRENCH BULLSHIT. I WANT THE FEES REMOVED IT NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH THE ADVISER GAVE ME FALSE INFORMATION BECAUSE I AM JUST FED UP AND DONE WITH MERCY COLLEGE, SO NOW IF SHE DOESN'T ATTEND CLASSES THIS SEMESTER THE ADVISER TOLD HER WE WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BALANCE YOU KNOW THAT $1978 THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF. BUT SHE CAN'T REGISTER FOR CLASS SO WE ARE NOW IN A FUCKED FUCKED SITUATION AREN'T WE? I KNOW FOR MERCY COLLEGE RIPPING OFF PEOPLE SEEMS LIKE WHAT YOU ARE DOING BECAUSE DOWN TO THE EDUCATION MY DAUGHTER HAS RECEIVED ITS BEEN TERRIBLE WHY SHOULD A STUDENT HAVE TO DEAL WITH SOMEONE NOT LIKING HER THE TEACHER NEEDS TO SET HIS PERSONAL ISSUES ALONE AND GIVE GRADES BASED ON ACADEMICS (DON'T WORRY I ALREADY CALLED DURING THE BREAK TO SETTLE THAT ISSUE, THE TEACHER FAILED HER BUT SHE HAD SUBMITTED ALL HER WORK THAT WAS AN A, THEN HE SAID THAT SHE HAD TO COME IN DURING HER WINTER BREAK TO RE-TAKE THE EXAM IS THAT FAIR? SHE GOT THE A ALREADY WAS THE WORK PLAGIARIZED? I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT THAT'S WHY AFTER YET AGAIN ME HAVING TO DEAL WITH IT IT GOT CORRECTED AND HE CHANGED HER GRADE SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF BULLSHIT DOESN'T IT? AT LEAST I THOUGHT SO BECAUSE IF I'M ON VACATION LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS RETAKE AN EXAM THAT I DID AND GOT AN A ON. SHALL I CONTINUE? EVERY SEMESTER FINANCIAL AID GETS FUCKED UP, AND I END UP SPENDING MORE THAN I EVEN INTENDED, THERE ARE NO REAL ADVISERS TO GUIDE ANYONE (BECAUSE NOW SHE SAYS OH YOUR DAUGHTER DIDN'T APPLY FOR TAP, SHOULDN'T THE ADVISER TELL HER THIS IN THE BEGINNING OF THE SEMESTER.) AND LASTLY DON'T EVER CALL THEM BECAUSE THEY WONT HELP YOU AND WILL LEAVE YOU ON HOLD, I HAVE ALREADY BEEN ON HOLD FOR AN HOUR SINCE I CALLED ABOUT THIS CONCERN,(HOLD FOR 1/2 AN HOUR FINALLY SPOKE TO SOMEONE, AND GUESS WHAT THEY PUT ME BACK ON HOLD YIPPEE IT'S NOW BEEN AN HOUR SINCE I'VE BEEN ON THE PHONE AND STILL NO HELP) SO I ALREADY KNOW THAT THIS ISSUE WILL NOT GET RESOLVED SINCE TODAY IS THE LAST DAY FOR HER TO REGISTER FOR CLASSES THANK YOU SO MUCH MERCY COLLEGE HOPEFULLY AFTER THIS THE SCHOOL RATING WILL GO FROM C- TO AN F THANK YOU SO MUCH MERCY COLLEGE THIS HAS BEEN A PLEASURE, I HOPE THIS EMAIL REACHES YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE INCLUDING ALL FUTURE STUDENTS SO THEY KNOW EXACTLY THE NONSENSE THAT IS GOING ON IN THIS SUPPOSED EDUCATION FACILITY BTW HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT YOU HAVE A 28% RETURN STUDENT RATE? ANY REAL INSTITUTION WOULD HAVE CHANGED THIS BUT MERCY DOESN'T CARE YOU GET ENOUGH IN SCAM MONEY TO ACTUALLY CARE HOW LEGITIMATE PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT YOUR INSTITUTION.}",
