At about the halfway mark, I mixed a mediascape of Senator Bernie Sanders heroic, though sadly ignored voice of reason filibuster speech to the Senate - trying to dissuade his colleagues to stop counting their cash long enough to vote no on the Bush/Obama tax cuts for billionaires. It's like hearing an obituary for the American dream - at least the one we're all supposed to live in - as opposed to the one that the wealthiest 2% get to live in. Sad, but worth listening to (Sanders' speech, not necessarily my mediascape)., 18963=Suprise, Suprise!!\u00a0 I do\u00a0get to do a December show after all!\u00a0 I filled in for Sun Lee, who was at Roger Waters' show.\u00a0 We opened with a couple of cuts from the new Garcia Estate Rhino release \"Ragged But Right\", the follow up (but never released)\u00a0 c.d.\u00a0of Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band \"Almost Acoustic\" c.d. It's now\u00a0available for purchace at WWW.DEAD.NET\u00a0 Next came the original version of \"The Other Side Of This Life\", a 1965 recording by Fred Neil. Then, things began to get wet. Several callers said that it was kind of strange looking out of the window and seeing heavy rain falling, and hearing it coming out of the speakers at the same time! I love our listening Audience! The Main Ten was the culpret. It was\u00a0just a little peek of what was coming later in the show. \"Main\u00a0Ten\" was\u00a0from Mickey Hart \"Rolling Thunder\".\u00a0 We polished off our \"Rain Set\" with a cut from the Garcia Band cd Cat's Down Under The Stars. Donna Jean did the vocal\u00a0honors on \"Rain\".\u00a0 For the next hour and a half or so, we played the second set of H. J. Kaiser, Oakland 11-7-87 Set\u00a02 as promised on last month's show. We had just enough time\u00a0to play\u00a0one more cut from \"Ragged But Right\" to close it out and hand it off to Tom Wendt \"Blues Junction\". \u00a0Happy Holidays to you all!!! See you next year!, 120261=Copyright \u00a9 2012 KBOO Community Radio | Copyright Policy | Community Guidelines | Website Illustration & Design by: KMF ILLUSTRATION}",
