            "I do feel safe in the area and especially on campus. They have security around at night on campus. You still don't want to go walking too far at night alone of course- but with a friend or on a bike you'll be fine. All the buildings on campus have an id lock that you just wave your card over, and in the dorms there is another to ride the elevator or take the stairs, so it's very secure. One minus, however, is that there are problems with theft sometimes- not within the dorms or studios, but the surrounding area around the school.",
            "Nope.",
            "While many think that the facilities should be better because of the tuition cost, lots of people are on scholarship and there really aren't that many students.",
            "On first fridays, all the galleries open for free at the Crossroads art district. You have to take a car or ride the bus to get there, but it's great and there are different shows up every month, as well as great funky food places to eat at while your out and about. Lots of people go, especially from KCAI, so it's not very hard to find a ride if you ask around. Even with only 3 classes you'll be really busy most of the time, and everyone looks forward for the opportunity to take a break en masse! It's true the school is pretty small- most of it is on one block, with the Kemper Museum of Modern Art across the street. On the other side of campus, also literally across the street is the Nelson Atkins Museum- and it is huge!! Both have free admission!",
            "There's a gas station and food/health store within easy walking distance. Catch a car ride to go to the Plaza, although it isn't such a bad bike ride- and it's where most of the shops and restaurants are. The cafeteria food is pretty good, but not the best. However, they have a really good salad bar, as well as vegetarian, and vegan options for all the meals.",
            "The area around the school is mostly apartments, which is nice because after freshman year you have to live off campus. In the middle of campus is a big green grassy area with pathways and nice shady trees to nap or read under. The dorms themselves are decent-laundry and bathrooms (that are cleaned everyday!) on all floors. Each student gets a bed that you can easily loft, a big plain desk with two drawers, and a wardrobe with two drawers on the bottom and hanging space (with enough space to stack more clothes). Carpet, and a window- but I wouldn't plan on bringing a plant until you know it's facing the south (i've heard many a sad tale from friends about some precious potted plants). If you go with a triple room, you'll be on the corner and get three windows. Doubles are pretty decent with plenty of space for my stuff, but triple rooms seem huge. Single rooms are the same as double rooms, minus the extra furniture. Each floor also has a hang out room with two comfy couches and a low table. There are two towers in the dorm building, with the first floor having a security desk, lobby with a nice tv, the cafeteria, really small gym room, conference room for clubs or study groups, info office, and student art gallery. The RAs are all pretty nice and will help with any questions or complaints. The basement of the dorms is where all the mailboxes are, as well as an art store with some basic snacks, necessities, and textbooks.",
            "All the teachers like to be called by their first name and are pretty friendly. Freshman year you have your foundations class which is 4 hours long, either in the morning or afternoon, and also a writing class once a week and art history twice a week. The studios are open 'til 1am except for mid terms and the end of the first semester when they're open until 3am. The foundations building itself has many good-sized classrooms for the class sizes, which is about 13-15 students. You'll want to get to know your studio buddies 'cause you'll be spending a lot of time working together and in crit. Your first semester in foundations is split 3 ways between observational, design, and 3D- each studio does them at different times. The teachers have a lot of flexibility over what they think each section means, with some classes making cardboard boxes and drawing them for weeks on end. Lots of people come in with very specialized skills for the major they want to go in, but foundations gets everyone to learn some important basic skills for all those areas. There is also a woodshop workshop where they will have you make a stool using all of the tools in the shop, which is quite a lot. You do get an entire Adobe package from the school, so you get Photoshop for free! Plus all the school computers have it and Word. Second semester is also split up three ways, but you have a different teacher for each and you get to choose things you are more interested in, such as ceramics, calligraphy, architecture, photography, etc. Most people (depending on their schedule) have no classes on thursday, which gives you some much needed time to work on projects from your studio class or some of those big essays.",
            "The Jannes library has two fireplaces that you can request to have turned on for instant warmth, and lots more computers. I would recommend buying the tool/supplies kit they offer over the summer, because you will use everything in it many times over.",
            "This is a small school, with a tight knit community. Everyone is very accepting. This school is in the middle of a city that loves art, and has many awesome opportunities!"

Monday - Friday has breakfast 7:15 to 9, lunch 11 to 1, and dinner 4:45 to 6. On Saturday and Sunday, there is brunch from 11 to 1 and dinner from 4:45 to 6. Breakfast is generally the same with a few changes. Lunch is Mystery Meat Monday, not knowing what lunch is ever going to be, Taco Tuesday, Wok Wednesday for stir fry or other Chinese food, chicken strip Thursday and sometimes fish Friday. The food has its off days but sometimes the food is great.}",
