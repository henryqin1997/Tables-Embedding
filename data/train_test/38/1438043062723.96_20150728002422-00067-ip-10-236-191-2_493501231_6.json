An active layer 41 is formed on the gate insulating layer 39 in a region overlying the gate electrode 33. The gate insulating layer 39 is an insulating substance, such as silicon oxide, silicon nitride, or the like, and has a thickness in the range of about 500-3000 angstroms. The active layer 41 of polycrystalline silicon has a thickness of about 30-1000 angstroms., 47481=Referring to FIG. 4B, a gate insulating layer 39 is formed on the insulated substrate 31 to cover the gate electrode 33 by depositing an insulating substance, such as silicon oxide, silicon nitride, or the like, at a thickness in the range of about 500-3000 angstroms. An active layer 41 is preferably formed by dehydration and laser annealing of the amorphous silicon that was deposited on the gate insulating layer 39 in a thickness range of about 300-1000 angstroms. Alternatively, other crystallization methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art may also be, used. Accordingly, when laser annealing is carried out, the gate insulating layer 39 prevents impurities in the insulated substrate 31 from diffusing into the active layer 41., 42145=FIG. 3 shows a cross-sectional view of a TFT according to the present invention. Referring to FIG. 3, in a TFT of the present invention, a gate electrode 33, source and drain electrodes 35 and 36 are formed preferably on a transparent insulated substrate 31 of glass, or the like. The electrodes have a thickness in the range of about 1000-5000 angstroms. The electrodes are electrically separated from one another electrically along a first axis that runs parallel to the surface of the substrate and approximately through the middle of the electrodes. The gate electrode 33, the source and drain electrodes 35 and 36 are formed by using a single mask to pattern a single layer of metal, such as Al, Mo, or the like. Not shown in the drawing, gate lines connected to the gate electrode 33 and the source electrode 35 have common bus shapes., 46622=FIGS. 4A to 4D show cross-sectional views of TFT fabricating steps according to a first embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 4A, in a TFT of the present invention, metal, such as Al, Mo, or the like, is deposited on a transparent insulated substrate 31 of glass, or the like, at a thickness of about 1000-5000 angstroms by sputtering or CVD. Next, a gate electrode 33 and source/drain electrodes 35 and 36 are formed by patterning the deposited metal with a single photolithography mask. The gate electrode 33 lies between the source and drain electrodes 35 and 36 and the three electrodes are separated electrically from one another. Not shown in the drawing, gate lines connected to the gate electrode 33 and the source electrode 35 have bus shapes., 52356=FIGS. 5A to 5B show cross-sectional views of certain stages of fabrication of a TFT according to a second embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 5A, after the step shown in FIG. 4A has been carried out, a gate insulating layer 39 having a thickness of about 500-3000 angstroms is formed by CVD of an insulating substance, such as silicon oxide, silicon nitride, or the like, on the insulated substrate 31 to cover the source and drain electrodes 35 and 36. Then, an amorphous silicon layer 37 having a thickness of about 300-1000 angstroms is formed on the gate insulating layer 39 by CVD., 23162=This application is a division of application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in a thin film transistor and a fabricating method thereof of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the inventions. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and equivalents. Accordingly, the present invention improves the degree of planarization, because source/drain electrodes and a gate electrode are formed by patterning the same layer. Further, the present invention reduces the number of fabrication steps by patterning a gate electrode and source/drain electrodes with a single mask. As mentioned in the foregoing description, a TFT according to the present invention has a BBC structure, wherein source/drain electrodes and a gate electrode are formed at the same time by patterning a metal layer and a planarized active layer is formed by placing a gate insulating layer between the gate electrode and the active layer. Source and drain regions formed at both ends of the active layer are connected to source and drain electrodes by first and second wires through first and second contact holes, respectively. A first wire 53 electrically connecting the source region 45 to the source electrode 35 and a second wire 55 electrically connecting the drain region 46 to the drain electrode 36 are formed, respectively,",
