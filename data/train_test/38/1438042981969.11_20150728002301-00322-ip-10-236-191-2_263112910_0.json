Computer software skills should be situated in the subject they are being used for; learning software is not an end in itself \u2014 the software is only used in relation to the subject.

The students\u2019 understanding of software is situated in the process of generating solutions to problems and in implementing design concepts. Treating software skills as abstract, unrelated to subject specific knowledge, either through training courses or the use of training manuals, does not take into account the discipline that the software application is to be used for.",
