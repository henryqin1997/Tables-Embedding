Any improvement may be made in part or all of the components. Further, the semiconductor fabrication process to which the present invention is applied is not limited to the CMOS process, but may be a Bi-CMOS process. In the above-described embodiment, the example in which the present invention is applied to DRAM is described. However, the present invention is not limited to these embodiments. For example, the present invention may be applied to other semiconductor memory such as SRAM, microcomputer, logic LSI, or system LSI. Incidentally, in the above embodiments, the example in which the delayed output signal OUT is used as the timing signal for activating the sense amplifier is described. However, it should be noted that the present invention is not limited to these embodiments. For example, the delayed output signal OUT may be used as a timing signal for activating a ward line or a column line. Moreover, the variable delay circuit of the present invention may be used as a delay circuit of a clock signal of clock synchronous type DRAM (for example, SDRAM). The same effects as those in the aforementioned first and second embodiments can be obtained with the variable delay circuit according to this embodiment. Namely, in this embodiment, the delay stages",
