            "Guerrillas in Our Midst Sun, 08/18/2013 (All day) - Sun, 12/29/2013 (All day) Central Library Before and during the Civil War, Confederate guerrillas \u2013 men like William Clarke Quantrill, \u201cBloody Bill\u201d Anderson, and Frank and Jesse James \u2013 battled federal troops and Jayhawker irregulars along the Missouri-Kansas border.
