            "Umass has been trying to increase campus safety, but overall there are almost always student security guards walking around at night, so you do feel safe.",
            "There are quite a few places to pledge to. Some are the stereotypical and some are charity or music based. Overall, if you wish to be a part of greek life, there will be a place for you. There is even a co-ed fraternity.",
            "There are all types of clubs and student run organizations. Anything you want, they have. And in the slim chance they don't, you can create a club.",
            "Any student that is willing to push a bit to do well. Its a large school so it is possible to get lost in it all, but if you want to get a great experience, you can.",
            "This campus is so large, most students do not even enter every building before they graduate! There are many free student shows on campus and tours that come through as well. During nice weather nights, movie are projected onto set up walls or the white water tank.",
            "This is a great school for the money as long as you try to make it.",
            "Everything. Amherst is one of the best college towns in the nation. There are tons of little shops, all different types of food too. There is a decent size mall 5 minutes away with a movie theater, lazer tag, and roller rink as well as shops. Twenty minutes away is Northampton, one of the coolest and most progressive towns you can think of. There are a few different theaters here to see shows, more shops and places too eat.",
            "Compared to most other schools, Umass dining is fantastic and it offers a lot of places to eat. There are always constants in the dining hall, such as a salad bar, deli, stir fry, and soup, so you can always find something. Once you can apply for the your campus meal plan, you have a great range of food right in the center of the campus.",
            "If you want to party, live quietly, have an apartment, surround yourself with culture, or to surround yourself with people who share your interest, Umass makes it all possible.",
            "Personally, I wanted to get a a lot out of my college in the way of academics. So I networked and took many classes that challenged myself. With the increase in interest in this school, there caliber is raising too.",
            "You can get a lot out of this school if you want. You can also cruise through this school if you choose to pick an easy major with easy classes and teachers. It is really up to you.",
            "A world of opportunities if you choose to accept them. This campus is so large and the faculty offers so much but you need to have the drive to find it. Best college experience because it encompasses all class levels, great location, great social life, and every club you can possibly want."

As long as other parts of your application are strong, you should be fine. I had strong recommendation letters and work experience/volunteer work so that helped., 28612=The campus security is very thorough, making sure all students that are non residents of a dorm on campus are signed in from 8:00 PM - 12:00 PM on weekdays and 8:00 PM - 2:00 AM on weekends. There are student cadets, as well as police officers at every corner on the weekend to control crime and prevent fighting, but it is not as heavily guarded during the week., 235631=We like breaking food world records. In 2010 we broke the world record for worlds longest California Sushi Roll and in 2011 we broke the record for worlds largest Stir Fry., 186689=Do a lot of research about the different kinds of activities and resources on campus. It'll definitely come in handy; I ended up being able to get an awesome on campus job in September of my freshman year because I found out about the place the previous August. Also, don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone, take advantage of everything going on. Try new things, talk to all different kinds of people!, 263849=Tons of clubs on campus and even through the town. Go running or to the park and play frisbee. Go dancing at Lit. Ride the B43 to Northampton and go eat or shop. Take the bus to Boston or NYC for the weekend (MegaBus is sometimes $1 for inconvenient times). The farmer's market sets up sometime in March and runs through October, weather permitting., 252005=Don't take 8 o'clock classes, just don't. If a class is full and you're waitlisted, talk to the teacher, they might be able to let you in., 869330=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 647506=A lot of parents want to make sure their child is getting the best possible education that they can afford. Our business school was rated number 46 out of 100 for 2013 in Business Weekly. We beat out many other business schools that are twice the tuition of Umass., 672108=When I went to UMASS in 2006 I lived in Southwest and it was a blast! You create lifelong friendships and you can even take classes in your dorms., 149699=This is dependent on where you live, but I still recommend staying on campus, at least for a year. That way you get to see how Umass operates up close. After that, if you live in Amherst or Northampton, take the bus, you'll save time and money. Otherwise, stay on campus, since many required classes for graduation start at 8:00 AM., 852650=Here are two University of Massachusetts traditions from the umassalumni website http://umassalumni.com/s/1640/alumni/index.aspx?sid=1640&gid=2&pgid=627 Did you know that the very first colors associated with Massachusetts Agricultural College in 1863 were red and blue? The school colors of maroon and white made their first appearance sometime in the 1870s when the college premiered its first football uniforms. We\u00e2??ve maintained this time-honored tradition ever since. Sam the Minuteman is the #1 UMass fan! He holds the record for most athletic events attended in one year, showing up for all home football, hockey, men\u00e2??s basketball and women\u00e2??s basketball games and occasionally checking out our soccer, field hockey, lacrosse, baseball and softball as well. See Sam in his ESPN commercial and become one of his Facebook fans., 760563=There are many residential zones on campus, and the one that stands out for its unique characteristic in the schools is the Southwest residential area. This is one of the two residential zones that doesn't look like a large town of condominiums and grass fields. Basically the party zone of UMass Amherst, it tends to get quite rowdy on weekend nights, especially when the weather is nice out, but, generally, the noise remains indoors otherwise and isn't really as bad as a zoo. Rather, just think of your local shopping mall on the first week of December. For other dorms, expect a little more silence, just as well as your usual college party or dorm get together,, 334934=The freshman dorms are pretty great, and you are guaranteed housing your first year, most of the dorms available being freshman only. The dorm in which I lived, Van Meter (In central) had just been renovated when I went, and was really sweet. The entire basement was renovated the summer of 2011, so we had a new kitchen, swanky couches, and flat-screen televisions. Housing in other parts of the campus was usually atleast acceptable, but varied. There were social events hosted by the RA's during finals week that were pretty cool, and some free tickets offered for local plays and movies. Overall, the people in my dorm were great and I came to befriend a bunch of them.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students I believe that this school is great for every student. It's great for students who want to blend in, because of its size, and it's also great for students who want to stand out- all you have to do is participate a few times in class and you will definitely grab your teacher's attention. The science program here is the only one that I am familiar with and it is amazing. Between the new science building and all of the older ones, there are many different courses available and always places where you can go for help. Also- any one who wants to be a vet or do anything with animals should definitely look into this school. Yes, its a state school, but the veterinary and animal science programs are amazing and you will get hands on experience right away. Tips for prospective students For any prospective students, try to get to know someone on campus whom you can shadow. It will allow you to see the campus from a student's perspective and get a taste for what the classes are like. Also, go on a tour of the campus- you will get to see various dorm rooms and also educational buildings. It looks big, but once you are campus, it will take you less than a week to find your way",
