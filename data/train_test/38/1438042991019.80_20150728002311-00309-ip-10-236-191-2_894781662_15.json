            "Many students will walk around downtown and get ice cream with friends or they will take a train to Chicago since the station is located right at the edge of campus. You will find most students hanging out in the plaza playing frisbee or volleyball.",
            "Food at the cafeteria is pretty good! But if you get tired of that food, there are many delicious restaurants located downtown along with places like Jamba Juice, Starbucks, and Red Mango.",
            "I don't live on campus but my friend does and she loves it! Everyone is super friendly and it's fun going out because the campus is only minutes away from Downtown Naperville.",
            "North Central uses trimesters so that means classes are fast paced since there are only ten weeks in the trimesters. By taking good notes and doing lots of studying, you'll have no problem keeping up.",
            "Live on campus because you'll regret not partaking in all the fun. Also make sure you study but also spend time with friends, too. In addition, be sure to take advantage of getting extra help from your professors.",
            "North Central College is a blast to be at! Everyone is friendly and it's easy to start conversations with other students and make friends. Also it's only minutes away from Downtown Naperville, extending the campus even further!"

    "textAfterTable": "Sarah from Newburgh, IN 06/15/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon. Reviewer has been to campus. 8 out of 8 people found this review useful. 2 of 28 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Those who care about academics but want a welcoming, fun atmosphere Tips for prospective students Visit campus and see just how nice Naperville is to live. The admissions team was really friendly and helpful both on the telephone and when I visited campus! Bang for the buck Although the tuition is not cheap, merit aid scholarships were very helpful in my case. Will enjoy being here The area around the campus is downtown Naperville and includes a great place to take walks (the Riverwalk), shopping, and restaurants. Since this college is close to Chicago, there are also nearly endless things to do within a 45 minute drive or train ride. Will learn a lot",
