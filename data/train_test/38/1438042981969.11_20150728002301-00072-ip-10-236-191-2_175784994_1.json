Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 1192=Flores, still rehabbing from a shoulder injury that dates back to May 2009, has been participating in full in the instructional league. He homered in his first game, has driven several other balls off the fence and has thrown to all bases with no troubles., 13065=SJM105/TimDz \u2013 Your roster looks about right but not sure about Slaten and Morgan and of course Dunn is still a wild card. Hopefully 1 more years experience will only add to this team's abilities. Without a substantial FA pickup or trade and depth of bench, this team you outlined is only a 75 win team IMHO.Tough to carry 3 catchers but I like that he is a RH batter if the Nats add another lefty OF to the bench. Can JFlo play 1st base as a backup? He is a good bat off of the bench and Pudge is only under contract through 2011., 14217=Anon @ 11:39 PM:Realistically speaking, the Nats probably won't contend next year. They could pull off a 2010 Padres though\u2026My comment was more focused on having two catchers on next years roster as opposed to three. Given the fact that Pudge will be 39 next season and the likelihood that he may have only one good shot at another series\u2026it would be the classy thing to do for Pudge if the FO sees no playoffs for the Nats in 2011., 15303=Don't forget Derek Norris, the catcher who was one of the Nats' top prospects entering 2010 (Baseball America rated him the #38 prospect in the minors). Norris's star dimmed slightly this year, probably due to injuries (off-season wrist surgery and concussion from HBP), but he still finished at Potomac with an .838 OPS. And he's just 21.It probably won't happen in 2011, but the Nats may have a valuable trading chip at catcher by 2012, whether that is Flores, Ramos, or Norris.}",
