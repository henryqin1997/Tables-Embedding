    "textAfterTable": "In depth Jump to: Verdict Formwatch Verdict HAWAANA seems to have been found a good opportunity to end a run of near misses and get in front so we side with Gay Kelleway's runner in this handicap with High Office not ruled out from a yard in form and Denton should feature if fit. Having missed out by less than a length on his last two runs the pick looks to be in form. Those two results were behind some well handicapped runners so despite carrying an extra 3lbs here Hawaana can score. Richard Fahey remains in top form and his High Office looks a leading player. He's yet to prove it in this company but having put in an improved run last time he should show up with a couple of lbs removed from his back. Denton won three of his five starts last season but looks a little high in the handicap on a return from a long break while Bagutta Sun is unexposed and could show more from a new career low mark. Only one horse seems to have strong claims on this race and that's Hawaana.
