The protein encoded by this gene is a class I PI3K found primarily in leukocytes. Like other class I PI3Ks (p110-alpha p110-beta, and p110-gamma), the encoded protein binds p85 adapter proteins and GTP-bound RAS. However, unlike the other class I PI3Ks, this protein phosphorylates itself, not p85 protein.[provided by RefSeq, Jul 2010], 97645=PI 3-Kinases (phosphoinositide 3-kinases, PI3Ks) are family of lipid kinases capable of phosphorylating the 3'OH of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides. They are responsible for coordinating a diverse range of cell functions including proliferation, cell survival, degranulation, vesicular trafficking and cell migration. The PI 3-kinases are grouped into three distinct classes. Class I PI 3-kinases are heteromeric consisting of a regulatory subunit and a 110 kDA catalytic subunits (3 forms in class 1A : alpha-, beta- and delta- and one in class 1B : gamma-). PI 3-kinases p110 alpha- and beta- are ubiquitously expressed whilst p110 delta- expression is associated with leukocytes. Activating mutations in the p110alpha- subunit have recently been discovered in certain types of cancer cell. Class II PI 3-kinases are large homomeric enzymes (C2alpha-, beta- and gamma-) that are sensitive to wortmannin (although less sensitive than Class 1 PI 3-kinases) but are resistant to LY 292002. Class III contains just one member, hVps34p, which is thought to play an important role in both protein sorting and nutrient sensing in concert with the mTOR pathway.}",
