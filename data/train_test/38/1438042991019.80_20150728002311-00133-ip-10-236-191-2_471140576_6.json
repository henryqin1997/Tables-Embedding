No. 08/043,271, filed Apr. 6, 1993 now abandoned., 71001=Given a supporting value flamework having, for example, 32\ufffd32\ufffd32=32768 supporting points for the color values, it is expedient to implement the input color calibration according to a compensation method having a smaller plurality of color values., 59229=The transformations of the color values R, G, and B into the standard color values X, Y, and Z of the standard color space CIE XYZ of 1931 according to step (A2) for calculation of the approximation solution is implemented with the assistance of matrixing coefficients M according to equations [8]., 40080=It is already known from the literature, for example from the periodical \"Der Druckspiegel\", No. 6, 1991, pages 580-592, \"Farbe in der Bildverarbeitung\", to transform the color values of an apparatus-dependent input color space acquired in a color image scanner for a universal color presentation into color values of an apparatus-independent communication color space on the basis of color space transformation, to undertake the corresponding corrections with reference to the transformed color values, and to then convert the corrected color values into the corresponding process color values of an apparatus-dependent output color space on the basis of a further color transformation., 44300=FIG. 1 shows the schematic structure and the signal flow of an image processing system. Input apparatus that scan point-by-point and line-by-line are represented by a scanner 1; apparatus that scan planarly are represented by a camera 2; and an apparatus for generating chromatic, graphic data such as, for example, graphic design stations, are represented by a video input 3. The possible output apparatus are indicated by a color monitor 4, by a color separation recorder or exposer 5, as well as by a proof recorder 6. The color values of the respective, apparatus-dependent input color space, for example the color values R, G, and B of the RGB color space generated in the input apparatus 1, 2, 3 are converted into color values of an apparatus-independent communication color space by input color transformation in a three-dimensional input color converter 7, for example into the color values L, a, and b of the CIELAB color space of the CIE of 1976, and are supplied to an image processing unit 8. The input color conversion from the apparatus-dependent input color space into the communication color space occurs via a reference color system., 57329=The measurement of the color values in a color original in a color image scanner generally occurs according to the three-region method. The spectral value functions of the scanner unit must correspond to those of a standard observer of the CIE from 1931 or a suitable linear combination thereof. The spectral value functions (r, g, b) derive from equations [6] as follows:}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although various minor changes and modifications might be proposed by those skilled in the art, it will be understood that I wish to include within the claims of the patent warranted hereon all such changes and modifications as reasonably come within my contribution to the art. The color calibration is thus ended and the actual scanning of the color original to be reproduced can begin. When it thereby turns out that the errors and the standard deviation are too great in a specific application, the color calibration can be repeated with a new, approximated conversion table until the desired deviation is achieved or fallen below. The interval function f(rgb,i) takes color fields of the test original 33 in the proximity of the current supporting point into greater consideration than more remote color fields. The selection of the interval function defines the quality and convergence of the method. Average value and standard deviation as characteristics of the quality of the color conversion can be calculated with known methods. f(rgb,i)=1/[(L*rgb-L*i (m))2 +(a*rgb-a*i (m))2 +(b*rgb-b*i (m))2 ]2 [ 14] The interval function f(rgb,i) is expediently an inverse function of the fourth order according to equation [14]. The summation i thereby proceeds over all color fields of the test original 33. f(rgb, i)=interval function. L*j (m), a*j (m), b*j (m)=approximated color values of a test color i and L*j (s), a*j (s), b*j (s)=exact color values",
