    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations FIG. 8 shows the use of a top module 95 which also functions as a cover for a SMCM 97. This configuration for a top module 95 permits the use of terminating resistors at the connectors 83, or separate terminating resistors on a substrate portion 99 of the top module 95. It is also possible to include active circuitry in the top module 95. FIG. 7 shows a top module 81, which is used as a terminal end for the connectors 27 on modules 51-53. The top module 81 includes a plurality of terminating connectors 83, which mate with connectors 27. The terminating connectors 83 may be provided with a resistor connecting shield conductors with the center conductors. Alternatively, separate terminating resistances may be provided to connect the conductors. The purpose of the terminating resistances is to avoid reflected signals which could result in ringing and other signal interference. The use of terminating resistances does not preclude the top module 81 from having active circuitry, such as circuits 91 shown. FIG. 6 shows a multichip module 71 in which an outer perimetric set 73 of connection terminals 27 are supplemented by an additional group 75 of connection terminals 27. This arrangement permits a more dense arrangement of connectors, while also permitting more flexibility in the assignment of functions to the connectors 27. For example, some of the connectors may be required for communicating exclusively between different",
