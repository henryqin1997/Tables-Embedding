While protein is key, the amount of protein is what's important. Too much, and it can't be processed by the body. Too little, and it won't work like it should. The inclusion of just the right amount of protein in Accelerade facilitates rehydration by optimizing the absorption of fluid.*, 3977=In 2006, researchers at St. Cloud University demonstrated that drinking Accelerade after cycling significantly enhanced rehydration by 15% compared to a conventional sports drink, and 40% compared to water.}",
