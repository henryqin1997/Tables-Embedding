In the belts 16 of the present invention, there would preferably be six to eight grooves 22 per inch as determined by counting across the belt 16 in a direction transverse to the grooves 22. The depth of the grooves 22 would fall in the approximate range of from 0.060 inch to 0.100 inch; the width of the grooves 22 would fall in the approximate range of from 0.020 inch to 0.040 inch. As may now be recognized, in consequence of the manner in which the present grooved, void-volume belts 16 are constructed, the present invention renders it no longer necessary to coat both sides of an endless base fabric with a polymeric resin material, or to cut spiral or annular grooves in the coating on one side thereof by mechanical means, as the strip used to cover the felt side of standard LNP belt to produce the belt of the present invention already is provided with the required grooves. In general, the strip 46 may be produced by extruding an appropriate polymeric material, such as polyurethane, through a die of appropriate shape. The strip 46 has a first edge 54, a second edge 56, a constant or fixed width, a uniform thickness, a first side 58, and",
