No. 09/351,788, filed Jul. 12, 1999, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety., 36286=Any source laser that provides. the desired frequency output may be employed in carrying out the invention. A distributed feedback laser can be used to reduce instrument size. Tunable or multiple fixed frequency lasers can be combined with bandpass filters (Puppels et al., Applied Spectroscopy 47, 1256-67 (1993)) that select for Raman scattering at wavelengths that provide optimum information for multivariate analysis (this reduces the cost and size of the instrument compared to the use of holographic filters or gratings)., 35054=The step of generating an excitation laser beam pulse can be carried out with any suitable laser beam source. The power of the excitation laser beam pulse should be sufficiently low to avoid tissue toxicity, but sufficiently high to provide a measurable Raman signal from the aqueous humor. In general, the laser beam pulse will be at a wavelength of from 700 to 900 nanometers, and more preferably will be at a wavelength of 780 to 860 nanometers to reduce fluorescence, increase tissue penetration, and reduce phototoxicity to the eye. The duration of the pulse will typically be from 1 to 2 seconds to 30 seconds or 60 seconds (i.e., one-half minute to one minute). The total energy of the laser pulse will typically be 200-500 milliJoules with instantaneous power not exceeding 30 or 50 milliwatts. The optical components of the apparatus used to carry out the method are preferably configured so that energy on the retina of the eye (as well as other areas susceptible to tissue toxicity, such as the lens and cornea) from the excitation laser beam pulse is not greater than 3000 milliwatts per square centimeter, and more preferably not greater than 2000, 1000 or even 500 milliwatts per square centimeter., 21207=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/092,545, filed Jul. 13, 1998, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety., 44030=The CCD detector in the spectrograph is of a red-shifted, back-thinned, thick epitaxial design such that its sensitivity is optimal in the 700-1100 nanometer spectral region. Other types of very sensitive detectors may be suitable as well., 22911=Numerous investigators over the years have suggested that the ratio of aqueous glucose to plasma glucose in the normoglycemic rabbit ranges from 0.42 to 1.01 (S. Pohjola, supra; D. Reddy and V. Kinsey, Arch. Ophthalmol. 63, 715-720 (1960); M. Reim et al., Ophthalmologica 154, 39-50 (1967); W. March et al., Diabetes Care 5, 259 (1982)). It is uncertain whether this variability is normal or could be attributed to differences in glucose measurement techniques, collection techniques, sample storage, and anesthesia. The relationship of aqueous glucose to rising, or falling, plasma glucose has not been previously studied in rabbits.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing is illustrative of the present invention, and is not to be construed as limiting thereof. The invention is defined by the following claims, with equivalents of the claims to be included therein. Therapeutic drugs can also be measured to determine their effectiveness in crossing the blood-aqueous or blood-brain barrier. Raman scattering molecules of different sizes that do not normally cross the blood-aqueous or blood-brain barrier could be administered to a patient intravenously. The presence of these molecules is then quantified by Raman spectroscopy of the anterior chamber of the eye. This can be used to determine the size of molecules which pass through the blood aqueous barrier. The amount of fluorescence that is subtracted to reveal the Raman spectra of these substances, with the device disclosed herein would reflect the passage of natural proteins through the blood-aqueous and blood brain barriers. The blood-brain and blood-aqueous barriers block passage of large molecules into the cerebrospinal fluid or aqueous humor. Many drugs and disease processes result in disruption of both the blood-aqueous barrier and the blood-brain barrier. In the case of such drugs or disease processes, disruption of the blood-brain barrier can be inferred from breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier. Breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier can be measured by measuring the protein content of the aqueous humor or by measuring the concentration of other substances (e.g., drugs) within the aqueous humor. Such substances may be quantifiable",
