            "I see Campus Safety around all the time. Early mornings and even at late nights. Lots of lighting around and they have those phones where you can call campus safety and they will pick you up and drop you off at your car.",
            "Anyone willing to put in about 1 hour of study/homework a day (including weekends), will do very well. Teachers are patient and can provide you with one-on-one time if needed, not like Universities.",
            "Only unusual thing I've noticed is the fact that all your classes will be spread out in random locations. Example: My Business Calculus class is located in the Bio Science building.",
            "Receiving an education doesn't have a price tag for me, however, the education you receive from a community college is on par with a Cal State University (I was a former Cal State Fullerton student). Therefore, best bang for the buck in my opinion.",
            "There are tons of sporting events throughout the year. From football, soccer, baseball, etc...",
            "Food is average. They have their own cafeteria, but wish they had some name brand fast food spots on campus.",
            "No dorms here that I know of. However, tons and tons of apartment complexes surround this campus.",
            "Toughest class for me was Business Calculus. Everything else was fairly easy. Some classes like Micro Econ give you just enough of a workload to keep you challenged. Just study 1-5 hours a week total, and you will do very well here.",
            "If you want a school that has the relaxed mentality, then this is a good school for you. But with any college, community college or university, you HAVE to attend class and do the homework. If you don't, you will have a difficult time succeeding.",
            "The classes and teachers are fairly easy, as long as you attend class and do the required homework/reading. And the free on campus tutoring is GOLD! The campus is clean. People are nice. One downside is the limited parking."

I finish up in november November and am eager to start working., 265550=I am comparing the price to a four year college or university. The price is $46 per unit which is extremely affordable. One year, with books and carrying an average 15 unit load, costs around $2000., 268201=Orange Coast College has been a great place to go to school because they offer excellent two year degree and certificate programs. Also because the cost is very inexpensive, roughly $2000 per year including books(averaging 15 units per semester). I would give OCC a 9 out of 10., 280248=I am now a junior in College and I have spent under $2000., 385707=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Compared to UC's and Cal States for sure! But the price just went up from $20 to $26. Am enjoying being here I am not involved on campus, but the environment is friendly. A lot of students smoke cigarettes. Am learning a lot It really depends on the class you take and if you take it for credit or for units.
