Jordan Zimmermann is scheduled to make his fourth rehab start on Monday, as the Salem Red Sox make their final regular-season stop at Woodbridge. Meanwhile, the Potomac offense remained potent rapping out twelve hits to score six or more runs for third straight game, just the second time this season that\u2019s happened. Bill Rhinehart and Jose Lozada paced the attack, each man hitting a home run, and Lozada having a four-hit night with two doubles and single to",

After a Boomer Whiting scored on a groundout after a bunt-single-turned-triple-via-error got the Chiefs within striking distance at 5-3 in the fifth, Atahualpa Severino served up four runs to the PawSox in just two-thirds of an inning to put the game out of reach.
