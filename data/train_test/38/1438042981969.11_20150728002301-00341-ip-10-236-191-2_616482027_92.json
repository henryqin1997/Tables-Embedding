The Sex Pistols, however, had another record: their reputation for offensive behavior. Their conduct at the public signing, and the reaction it caused among other A&M artists who questioned whether the Pistols could fit into the A&M \"family\", caused Alpert and Moss to buy out the Pistols contract. They were dropped from the artist roster on March 16. By then, some copies of the single had been printed and found their way to the public. Billboard reported that the Sex Pistols contract was for two years and 20 tracks. The group's manager, Malcolm McLaren, estimated the deal was worth about $240,000.
