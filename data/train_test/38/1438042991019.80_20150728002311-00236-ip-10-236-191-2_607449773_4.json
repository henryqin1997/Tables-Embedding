Their season-best 61.0 field-goal percentage was the highest given up by Indiana since March 15, 2008., 182228=Copyright \u00a9 2015 NBA Media Ventures, LLC. All rights reserved.

Jeff Teague turned it over near midcourt, Westbrook took off the other way on what looked to be a layup, only to flip the ball back over his head to Durant streaking down the court for a thunderous dunk that stretched the lead to 88-75 with 6:47 remaining., 12692=Coming off an impressive 118-94 home victory over Indiana, the Thunder had more trouble on the road against the Hawks. But the result was the same: another Oklahoma City win, despite a tough shooting night for Russell Westbrook. He was held to 14 points on a 6-of-21 effort, though he did sink an impressive reverse layup with 1:41 remaining to help finish off Atlanta., 14604=Atlanta's Kyle Korver missed three shots beyond the arc in the first half, but knocked down a 3-pointer early on in the third quarter to extend his record streak with at least one trey to 91 games in a row.

OKC coach Scott Brooks called timeout with 10:16 left, and sent Durant back in the game. On three consecutive Atlanta possessions, Durant had a blocked shot on Kyle Korver, another blocked shot (Mike Scott) and a steal from Williams to spark a 10-3 OKC run., 19747=NOTABLE: Millsap has hit at least one 3-point shot in a career-best seven consecutive games. . . . Thunder guard Thabo Sefalosha missed the game with a strained right knee. Rookie Andre Roberson started in his place, and made his only shot to finish with two points, five rebounds and a blocked shot in 12:15. . . . Reserve big man Gustavo Ayon was unavailable for Atlanta after suffering a left ankle sprain and left leg contusion in Friday's win over the Cavs. . . . Korver shot 1-for-6 on 3-pointers, giving him at least one trey in 91 consecutive games to further his NBA record.}",
