            "Bradley is not in the best neighborhood, and while campus police are frequently patrolling, they cannot be everywhere. Bradley's president is really good about informing students of safety issues on campus. As long as students are smart about their safety, they're fine.",
            "I have not been involved in Greek life, but 30% of Bradley students are in a fraternity or sorority. Greeks sponsor a lot of cool events on campus like cookouts, pancake breakfasts, fashion shows, and bake sales.",
            "There are at least 50 student organizations for students to get involved in, and you can find out about these groups during welcome week. There are philanthropies, religious groups, sports teams, adventure groups, and Greek oraganizations",
            "Students who know how to balance fun and academics. The rigor of classes requires time and effort, but you need to be able to have fun in your down time.",
            "Welcome week is the best tradition we have at Bradley. The whole week is dedicated to welcoming students back to campus, so there are activities all the time. My favorite event is Taste of Bradley, where local vendors sell food at a discounted price.",
            "Bradley is undergoing a campus renewal project right now, so a lot of money is going toward updating buildings and creating new sports facilities. I wish more money would be put toward student activities and the career center.",
            "There are three movie theaters in Peoria, none of which are close enough to walk to. There is a park very close to campus, which is where our softball team plays. There are also many bars near campus, and there are even more downtown.",
            "There are two cafeterias on campus that have a wide variety of options. There is a convenience store and two starbucks on campus. Across the street from campus is a stripmall with other dining options (bellacino's, subway, jimmy johns, sushi, fieldhouse, great wall, avanti's)",
            "The quality of the dorms really depends on which one you choose (williams and u-hall are best). The cafeterias have lots of options, including vegetarian menus. Get involved with floor activities and hall council.",
            "Freshman and sophomore year are pretty easy. Junior year is a little harder than high school. Senior year is tough.",
            "Do not be afraid to talk to your professors during their office hours; most of them love seeing students. Get involved with groups on campus that interest you.",
            "Bradley has a lot of fun campus activities for students to get involved in. The professors are usually very focused on providing good feedback to students. The career center is helpful if you start looking for grad schools or jobs early on."

It's obviously not a fine dining experience though. As a vegetarian I am a tad disappointed with the options that I have. My main problem is with the options you have for meal plans. The only meal plans available cost 2000 dollars. I am 5'1 and 110 pounds, I do not eat 2000 dollars worth of food. If you do, it's a great deal! I do not., 164991=Students will find more than just the average college experience at Bradley University. With a student/faculty ratio of 12:1, each student receives personal attention in the classroom and is able to establish a unique relationship with their professors. In addition to the opportunity for students to get to know their professors well, students at Bradley also have numerous opportunities to meet with the President of the University; a very rare opportunity at most other Universities. Also unique to Bradley; all classes at Bradley University are taught by Professors with a degree in their area of expertise instead of a teaching assistant or graduate student. Each student is also offered two hours a week of free tutoring in any subject. Upon accepting admittance to Bradley University, students are setting themselves up for success. Excellent resources such as the Smith Career Center, assists students in achieving helpful internships and timely job placements upon graduation., 275763=The school is very proud of their founder, Lydia Moss. They take mornings class off one day in October to celebrate the founding of the school., 39442=Bradley's campus is a very greek campus. There are over 1300 students in the various fraternities and sororities., 233527=Peoria is somewhat a dangerous area. That's not to say that you should be scared out of your mind walking from the cafeteria to your dorm at 4 pm on a weekday.No! Just take precaution and think before you do. This means you should NOT take a jog at 5 o'clock in the morning carrying your brand new iphone-that wouldn't be smart!What you should do is walk in groups when you have to walk somewhere at night, and use your brain!! Nothing will happen to you if you make wise choices. Also, since police are always patrolling the campus you shouldn't have a reason to be afraid. They are always on guard for trouble.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Bradley University is a top school in the engineering and nursing field. As an engineering student myself I am learning all sorts of interesting, helpful, and lifelong information. Bradley is opening the world to me through the eyes of a student, of a person ready to learn. Even if engineering or nursing isn't your major, the other curriculums are still top of the list. The teachers are always ready to help you and guide you to excellence. Your learning skills and experience will soar to new heights.
