Without our loyal supporters, we would not have been able to come so close to reaching our goal.\u00a0Your dollars are truly making a difference, right here at home, to impact our community in the areas of education, health and income., 30249=Mr. Faulkner, I have a few facts and questions for you. When Bill Clinton left office in 2001, we (the United States) had a budget surplus. George W. Bush took office and eight years later the economy has been driven in the ground like an Idaho potato. The only TEA parties we heard about during Bush\u2019s tenure are the ones little kids took their baby dolls to., 43434=Copyright \u00a9 2015, 23753=I would like to take a moment and tell everyone about a recent week. On July 17, I left Lancaster County going to Seneca for the S.C. Dixie Softball State Tournament. Along with me were 12 of the best 13, 14, 15 and some 16-year-old young ladies I have met so far in my life., 32806=I recently accompanied my daughter to the S.C. Employment Security Commission. I dropped her off about 10:30 a.m. and ran some errands. When I returned at 11:30 there was still a huge line of people left to be seen. My daughter had not yet been seen and I sat down and waited with her for awhile., 30090=I would like to respond to Danny Faulkner\u2019s letter, \u201cFocus should be on issues, not insults,\u201d in the July 31 edition of The Lancaster News., 26328=This letter is in reference to the article, \u201cLancaster\u2019s last \u2018full service\u2019 filing station closes its doors,\u201d in the July 19 edition of The Lancaster News. No where in the article was the mention of one of the most memorable employees, Paul \u201cBig Reed\u201d Barnes, my dad. He worked there for more than 30 years.}",
