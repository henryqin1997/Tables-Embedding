At times in the contest at PK Yonge on Friday night Nov. 19, the Red Devils had five players well under six foot tall on the floor in their 71-56 loss to the Blue Wave. The entire night, despite three-point baskets by Paul King, Jacques Edwards, and James Monroe, it was one shot a trip down the floor for the Red Devils. Six players who play a vital roll in the rotating offense of Coach Steve Faulkner\u2019s scheme were still active in football, and follow up activities. According to the PK Yonge coach, he had two of his best players on suspension for 10 days. But the Blue Wave had Devin Wilson, and Ron Foxx. The Blue Wave out rebounded the Red Devils 31-16 for the game. The score was tied at 13-13, as a slow moving first quarter ended. As the teams exchanged baskets during a lack luster second quarter by both teams, it was four offensive rebounds by the Blue Wave as time was running out that gave them a 23-22 lead at the half time break. The Blue Wave out scored the Red Devils 29-19 in the third quarter to take a 52-41 lead to start the fourth and final quarter. As the Blue Wave ran out to a 16 point lead midway through the fourth quarter, the Red Devils cut the lead to 10 points at 65-55 with just over two minutes remaining in the game. The Red Devil\u2019s emptied the bench for the last minute and a half as PK scored six straight points for the 71-56 win. Paul King led the Red Devils with 17 points, and James Monroe added 13 points. Devin Wilson played an outstanding game for the Blue Wave and led all players in scoring with 23 points. Ron Foxx added 16 points for the Blue Wave. \u00a0}",
