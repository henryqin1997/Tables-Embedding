            "I guarantee you, the campus security is great.",
            "The Greek life is pretty awesome. Even though I am not in a Greek life, They throw lots of fun parties especially the fraternities.",
            "There are over a hundred clubs to join, so definitely consider in joining some of them. Don't join a lot if you think it's overwhelming. These are some of the few clubs: the International club, Democratic and Republican club, PRIDE club, Optimist club, Habitat for Humanity and a lot more.",
            "The University of Evansville just currently announced the Big Freeze. Starting next year, 2013, incoming freshmen's tuition will be frozen. What that means is, whatever tuition the students have currently will remain the same for the next four years of their college. So it is great for parents and students because they can save money for themselves.",
            "The mall is very close to the school about a five minute drive. You can go visit the Evansville downtown which is very pretty because it is right next to the Ohio River, which is the border of the Indiana.",
            "The foods are okay, to be honest. But it may just be me. They have a variety of foods to choose from.",
            "The dorm life is amazing. The rooms are decent and big enough to live in.",
            "The staff wants you to be successful academically, so they are always there to help you.",
            "If you attend the University of Evansville, I guarantee that you will feel at home. You will learn to love UE like I did.",
            "They have a beautiful campus. The faculty and staff made me feel at home. They have a great nursing program."

This fountain adds a peaceful atmosphere to the campus. Around this fountain are two concrete walls that explain the meaning behind this beautiful fountain., 150338=The University of Evansville just currently announced the Big Freeze.

So it is great for parents and students because they can save money for themselves., 168225=Sticker price is expensive (~$40K/year) but scholarships are generous and the Big Freeze (no changes in tuition for current and incoming 2013 freshmen) are a big help. Work-study as well as a few other on campus jobs are available., 253288=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 89862=Everyone here is obsessed with the Basketball team and Soccer team. There are many clubs to chose from, but be warned with a school of a little more than 2000, don't expect to have huge group activities., 147248=The University of Evansville is an amazing campus where students can feel very much at home. It is very personal and students have the chance to really connect with their peers and professors since the student-teacher ratio is 13:1, and every faculty member makes it a personal effort to make sure that every students succeeds.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Although UE is a wonderful place to be, it is expensive. $34,000 a year is a lot of money. Especially since it doesn't always seem like that money is going places that I would like it to. However, they are really great about trying to get you the greatest amount of aid as possible, which was a big plus for me. The fact that I pay, after the scholarships and work study, the same amount as attending an in-state college.... That's banking. Am enjoying being here I absolutely love UE!! Although the dorms aren't always the greatest and I complain about the food a lot, the students, professors, and faculty make up for it. I've made so many friends, and from all around the world, too! I could never think of studying anywhere else! Am learning a lot UE really has so much to offer in terms of learning, especially on the global front. Not only have I learned a lot from my professors in the classroom on campus, but I've learned so much from the students around me as well. With 8% of students international, how can you not learn something? Plus, the study abroad programs are great. I attend Harlaxton College, UE's English campus, last",
