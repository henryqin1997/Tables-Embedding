I have a series of standard real-life images I shoot with all new lenses. I noticed that at 70mm the lens was immaculate. The longer the focal length and I noticed that from the extreme left of the frame to about 1/3 from the left there was noticeable drop of sharpness as compared to the same part of the frame on the right side. By 200mm, the results were completely unusable",
