He won the award despite a mid-season ankle injury that kept him out of three games and limited him in several others. He became the fifth Eagle \u2013 all in the last 12 seasons -- to win the award, joining Marc Axton (2002), Matt Nelson (2004), Rodney Stuckey (2006) and Glen Dean (2010) as recipients. The 6-foot-7 native from Boronia, Australia, was also the lone Eagle on the BSC All-Conference team, earning honorable mention accolades.
