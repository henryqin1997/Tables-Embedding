    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{46385=Kansas City is another road trip that fans have attended in large numbers throughout the years. My first trip to Kansas City was a disappointing one, with the Fire losing to the Kansas City Wizards in the final of the U.S. Open Cup in 2004., 47530=In 2001, Fire fans went to Crew Stadium in their hundreds, even when the Fire was not playing! The Fire had been knocked out in the Conference Semifinals by the Los Angeles Galaxy and many fans turned up to cheer against LA (and for the then Frank Yallop-led San Jose Earthquakes) at MLS Cup., 50369=Ever since Portland came into the league in 2011, the Fire supporters umbrella, Section 8 Chicago, has had a very good relationship with the Timbers Army, Portland\u2019s main supporters group. The relationship is based on mutual respect and a shared \u201cdislike\u201d of all things Seattle., 48254=Montreal can be quite cold in April, but luckily for Fire fans, the April date is only the first time the Men in Red visit The City of Saints. I hear the weather is a lot nicer in mid-August, when the Fire visit for the second time., 69754=As they do on all buses, Section 8 Chicago is subsidizing an additional $35 per person on the 2014 Away Season Ticket on top of the $50 subsidy provided for individual bus travel to these matches., 50647=Week 2 \u2013 Portland away \u2013 Saturday, March 15\u00a0, 92077=Following the draw, Marstaller said the published fourth round scenarios would not be accompanied Friday by match dates yet. This is because the Fourth Round has three possible match dates over an eight-day span. With USL PRO and the PDL, along with amateur sides having league games between the June 10-18 Fourth Round window, all clubs that have the potential to host a Fourth Round match will have the weekend to give their preferred hosting date before U.S. Soccer balances the already scheduled league games. Because of the logistical process, hosting dates are expected to be announced sometime next week.\u00a0, 39890=Saturday, October 26 Philadephia Union \u00a0vs. Sporting KC - 2pm CT (NBC Sports Network) Toronto FC vs. Montreal Impact - 3pm CT (MLS Live), 65025=A third round pick in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft, Chicago Fire midfielder Logan Pause had already capped off a decade with the Men in Red last year before extending his deal to come back for a 12th season with the club in 2014 on Friday., 47215=There have been many highs experienced in Columbus, such as Paulo Wanchope\u2019s winning goal in a 2007 match after the game was delayed due to a torrential downpour. Fire fans were also 45 minutes away from MLS Cup in 2008 but for a Crew comeback in the second half which left Fire fans, including myself, devastated. There\u2019s also the 2012 invasion which saw 600 Fire supporters make the trek., 70286=Toronto nightlife no doubt has more to offer than Kansas City or Columbus but what Marinacci is referring to is the fact that the past few seasons, the team has played away in Toronto at midweek in September, making it difficult to coordinate a strong contingent of Fire supporters to travel by bus., 46510=Week 16 & 32 Kansas City away \u2013Sunday, July 6\u00a0& \u00a0Friday, October 10, 34828=x - 1) New York Red Bulls\u00a0 Current Points: 53 (15-9-8) Games Remaining: 2 (1 home / 1 away) Last 5 Games: DDWWW (11pts) 2013 Home/Away Record: 10-2-4 / 5-7-4 Maximum Possible Pts: 59 Average Opponents Pts: 47.0 Remaining Schedule: 10/20 @ HOU, 10/27 vs. CHI, 55339=2001-2004; 2008-2013, 136223=On a demanding July with MLS play and the U.S. Open Cup\u2026, 59309=In Corrales' case, while he never played for another MLS club other than San Jose after being traded back to the Quakes in 2001, he did spend a few years abroad in Norway with HamKam that keep him out of the consecutive seasons count. Corrales spent a total of 12 seasons in San Jose over three stints (1996-97, 2001-04, 2008-13), 43901=On the field, the Fire have had some good success against a TFC team that has languished near the bottom of the MLS table since starting in 2007. Thankfully, this match is on a Saturday in August so I expect a much larger contingent of Fire fans to attend., 49485=Week 6 & 22 \u2013 Montreal away \u2013 Saturday, April 12 and Sunday, August 16, 29748=Rundown:\u00a0Following the disappointing 2-2 draw to Montreal on September 28, naysayers said the Fire should give up on the season and \u201cplay the kids\u201d with only home game remaining out of their final four., 46802=The Fire only play once at Fire House East this season and I expect to see a lot of red behind the goal\u00a0on May 24., 71446=Returning this year, the Independent Supporters Association is offering all Fire supporters an away season ticket, which guarantees round trip bus fare and match tickets for this season\u2019s Fire away games in Columbus (May 24), Kansas City (July 6) and Toronto (August 23) for just $200., 49371=The Fire were the Montreal Impact\u2019s opponents in the Canadian club\u2019s first home MLS back in 2012 and I was lucky enough to be at the game and had a great time., 50756=With that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at five exciting dates in the 2014 Fire calendar:, 30099=5)\u00a0Chicago Fire Current Points: 46 (13-12-7) Games Remaining: 2 (1 home / 1 away) Last 5 Games: WWDLW (10pts) 2013 Home / Away Record: 9-4-3 / 4-7-4 Maximum Possible Pts: 52 Average Opponents Pts: 39.5 Remaining Schedule: 10/19 vs. TFC, 10/27 @ NY, 29345=Now above the red line and tied on points with Montreal (and Philadelphia), the Fire are actually in a position where they could clinch a playoff berth this weekend and still have the possibility to finish in the East\u2019s top three spots, something that would have been unthinkable back in mid-May., 28007=6) Philadelphia Union Current Points: 46 (12-10-10) Games Remaining: 2 (1 home\u00a0 / 1 away) Last 5 Games: DWWLL (7pts) 2013 Home/Away Record: 7-4-5 / 5-6-5 Maximum Possible Points: 52 Average Opponents Pts: 49 Remaining Schedule: 10/19 @ MTL, 10/26 vs. SKC, 26923=7)\u00a0New England Revolution Current Points: 45 (12-11-9) Games Remaining: 2 (1 home / 1 away) Last 5 Games: WDDWL (8pts) 2013 Home/Away Record: 7-5-4 / 5-7-4 Maximum Possible Points: 51 Average Opponents Pts: 41 Remaining Schedule: 10/19 vs. CLB, 10/27 @ CLB, 112186=With those done, I will underscore that the most important principle to keep in mind for how pairings are determined comes from Page 7 of the 2014 U.S. Open Cup Handbook. It states:, 29501=Two weeks later, they've won two straight MLS games for the first time since early July and both of them came on the road. Naysayers\u2026, 69024=Now through mid-May (when bus tickets for the Columbus trip will cut off), Section 8 Chicago is in a heavy push to sell the Away Season Ticket for the year. As part of that push, the ISA will be raffling one off during Saturday\u2019s Watch Party at A.J. Hudsons.\u00a0, 140069=Sunday, July 6, 2014, 32634=3) Houston Dynamo Current Points: 48 (13-10-9) Games Remaining: 1 (1 home / 1 away) Last 5 Games: DWWWL (10pts) 2013 Home/Away Record: 9-3-4 / 4-6-4 Maximum Possible Points: 56 Average Opponents Pts: 34.5 Remaining Schedule: 10/20 vs. NY, 10/24 @ AU**, 10/27 @ D.C., 47999=Week 11 \u2013 Columbus away \u2013 Saturday, May 24, 45206=With the October 11 game coming so late in the season, it may be a pivotal one in terms of Playoff positioning., 33665=x - 2)\u00a0Sporting KC Current Points: 52 (15-10-7) Games Remaining: 2 (1 home / 1 away) Last 5: DWLWW (10pts) 2013 Home/Away Record: 8-5-3 / 7-5-4 Maximum Possible Pts: 58 Average Opponents Pts: 31 Remaining Schedule: 10/18 vs. D.C., 10/23 vs. OLI**, 10/26 @ PHI, 113446=The Fourth Round draw for the 2014 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup occurred Friday morning at Soccer House in downtown Chicago and with MLS teams entering at this stage, the process was much more elaborate than the straight forward flips from last week\u2019s Third Round draw., 64706=Logan's longevity got me thinking about players that held the longest consecutive tenures in terms of both years and games played ith one MLS club. After some research, I found that Fire legend and new assistant coach C.J. Brown holds the record for consecutive seasons with one team at 13, while Logan will tie Cobi Jones (LA Galaxy) and Pablo Mastroeni (Colorado Rapids) when he makes his first appearance for the Fire in 2014.\u00a0, 45072=Week 23 \u2013 Toronto away \u2013 Saturday, August 23, 25853=8) Columbus Crew Current Points: 41 (12-15-5) Games Remaining: 2 (1 home / 1 away) Last 5 Games: LWWWL (9pts) 2013 Home / Away Record: 7-6-3 / 5-9-2 Maximum Possible Points: 47 Average Opponents Pts: 42 Remaining Schedule:\u00a010/19 @ NE, 10/27 vs. NE, 39592=Sunday, October 27 D.C.

Teams that are not bolded either did not have a suitable home venue or didn\u2019t apply to host (U.S. Soccer did not distinguish the reason on this sheet). Upon arrival to Soccer House, Competition Secretary Paul Marstaller handed me a sheet of paper with four geographic groupings, plus a wild card pool. The most straightforward grouping was the top table which featured eight Third Round matchups across from eight MLS teams that made \u201ca logical geographic fit\u201d with those lower league pairings. As all business as a selfie can be prior to walking into Soccer House... \u201cAfter each Third Round pairing has been determined, each Division I (MLS) team entering in the Fourth Round will be matched geographically to play the winner of a specific Third Round pairing.

    "textAfterTable": "For the local Fire fans, I was able to take OFFICIAL VIDEO documenting the Fire's winning coin flip: The second grouping of matchups pooled three Northeast MLS sides with three lower league pairings. Of note here, Marstaller said that because the Harrisburg City Islanders and Baltimore Bohemians are about equidistant to D.C. United and Philadelphia Union, a flip off between the two sides would be done to determine which club would host the winner of that Third Round Matchup. Based on alphabet, D.C. United was assigned heads and Philadelphia tails, with the Union winning. Because neither Harrisburg or Baltimore applied to host, no flip was necessary as hosting rights defaulted to the Union.\u00a0 LOWER-LEAGUE MATCHUP MLS TEAMS FLIP ASSIGNMENT Harrisburg City Islanders (USLP)/Baltimore Bohemians (PDL) D.C.
