            "UMD is great for students who want a lot of opportunites with a small town feel. Everything is compact and connected. The people are friendly and the access to education is endless",
            "Live in the dorms. It really helps you get connected to people. Also try to apply early. The earlier you apply, the better your chances are of getting accepted and the housing process depends on when you applied",
            "This college is a great price compared to the price of school now. There are many scholarships available for students. There is a student activity fee that allows us to participate in all the activities and it is well worth it.",
            "The atmosphere at Duluth is great. The dorms are connected to the building so the whole school has a homey feel. There are a lot of great activities for students on campus and there is always someone to hang out with.",
            "I have taken four classes so far. I have two honors classes. These are great because they are a smaller setting and look great on a transcript. It is much easier to ask questions in a smaller setting, and it is more conducive to learning"

Watch out for the potential health plan that the school adds onto your tuition bill if you don't show proof of insurance. A lot of my friends were out $1000-2000 until they realized they were added to the plan and got out of it, which isn't possible after the first few weeks., 308478=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 305205=To be certain UMD is the right college for you a campus tour is very helpful. Don't be concerned with the cold Minnesotan weather, dorms are connected to the campus via a heated sky walk so flip-flops and shorts are often worn year round. Plenty of UMD scholarships are available to apply for before May of each year., 107955=The Dining Center's foods average at best (and utterly mysterious sometimes). There's an ice cream machine too but it's normally broken down or the ice cream is bad. The hours are from 7:30 to 7:30 which isn't good. The coffee shop has great atmosphere though it's weekend hours aren't anything to brag about (it's closed on sunday). There also is a Food court with a 50's themed burger place, an italian and a sub place. The only one open until 10 would the the italian place otherwise everything else's hours vary widely.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Dorm Life if you want a good dorm room, apply for housing early. first chance you get. i got stuck in lake superior hall. avoid doing so. it's a fine place, no major problems with appliances, we just got wifi this year, free cable, free fridge(very rare for schools to give you free cable or a free fridge) and the bathrooms are nice. but it's very hard to get to know people on your floor because the hallways are so small and the rooms are so far apart. definitely go for griggs if you get the chance. Academic Rigor there are easy classes, there are hard classes. most every teacher is fair in their grading, so studying consistently and well will get you a good grade. Tips for prospective students like any other school, you need to get involved right away. there's bulldog welcome week where freshmen come in a few days early to learn the grounds, find people to start out the year with, and just in general get to know the school, which is nice. but definitely do stuff outside of class and outside your dorm room right away-it makes all the difference because that's the time you find your niche of people you want to be with. there's a lot of scrambling around during",
