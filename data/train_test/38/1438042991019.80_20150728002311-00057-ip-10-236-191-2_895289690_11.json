            "Working fulltime as well as going to school fulltime provided me with little free time to do anything considered fun.",
            "As I attended all online classes, I do not have any suggestions in regard to food and dining.",
            "I attended 100% online classes so I did not stay in a dorm.",
            "Some classes were more difficult than others. You can expect to do group projects in just about every class. The online discussions are vital to passing any class at UIU.",
            "This is a great, affordable online school. At the time, I did not realize there were Division 1 schools that offered similar degrees for comparable prices. I would recommend looking all options, although I do not regret my degree at UIU.",
            "I found the faculty to be very diverse and well trained in their respective studies. The courses were well laid out. Additionally, I never had a problem with communication from any department regarding any situation."

They had a high percentage of studnets who graduated and earned a bachelors, or masters degree in in those fields. They offer a number of undergraduate majors",
