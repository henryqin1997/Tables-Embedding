    "textAfterTable": "13 Songs Customer Reviews A Great Step Forward For STH \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by FloatingSuburbia Having been following Startle The Heavens' music since his first release \"Find Yourself Here\" I've been able to hear him progress as a musician. Each album seems to outdo the last in both musicianship and craft (and that's not to say that it wasn't already good). STH takes on a heaver Post-Rock Direction this time around but doesn't lose his attention to detail in the softer moments. The addition of the steel guitar in tracks like \"Clouds On a Calm Sky\" and The Approach of Night\" come as a nice surprise to the album and help set his sound apart even further from other artists living in the genre. I find it hard not to get lost in beautiful open landscapes with track titles such as \"When California Was Wild\" or \"Skin of the Mountain's Face\". The album art is also very fitting to the overall sound and feel of the album. If you're new to the Post-Rock/Instrumental genre or a long time fan like myself, you're sure be satisfied with this release.",
