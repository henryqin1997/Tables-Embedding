The autoclave was charged with 300 g of propylene and stirred for 24 h while maintaining the temperature at 25\ufffd C. The pressure was then vented. The polymer product was floating on the solvent. Most of the solvent was removed in vacuo, and the polymer was dissolved in minimal CHCl3 and then reprecipitated by addition of excess acetone. The polymer was dried in vacuo at 60\ufffd C. for three days to give 271 g of green rubber.

Yield=1.68 g. 1 H NMR analysis: 114 Me/1000 CH2., 543967=1Eicosene (19.0 g) was polymerized in methylene chloride (15 ml) for 24 hr using catalyst { (2,6-i-PrPh)2 DABMe2 !PdCH2 CH2 CH2 C(O)OCH3 }SbF6 - (0.047 g, 0.05 mmol). The solvent and unreacted monomer were removed in vacuo. The polymer was precipitated to remove residual monomer by addition of excess acetone to a chloroform solution of the polymer. The solution was filtered to collect the polymer. The precipitated polymer was dried in vacuo to give a 5.0 g yield. 13 C NMR quantitative analysis, branching per 1000 CH2: Total methyls (27), Methyl (14.3), Ethyl (0), Propyl (0.2), Butyl (0.6), Amyl (0.4),\u2273Hexyl and end of chains (12.4)., 830245=A 23 mg sample of (2,4,6-MePh)2 DABH2 !PdMeCl was slurried in toluene (2 ml) and norbornene (2.7 g). PMAO (1.0 mL, 9.6 wt % Al) was added. Solids immediately formed and after a few seconds stirring stopped. The reaction was quenched after 2 hours by addition of MeOH/10% HCl. The solid was filtered, crushed and washed well with MeOH and finally with a 2% Irganox\ufffd 1010 in acetone solution.

The resulting orange powder (2.44 g, 96.0%) consisted of a mixture of 6a(Me) (91%), 5'a(Me) (5%), and 5a(Me) (4%), according to 1 H NMR spectroscopy. 6a(Me): 1 H NMR (CD2 Cl2, 400 MHz, rt) \u03b4 8.31 and 8.26 (s, 1 each, N\u2550C(H)--C'(H)\u2550N), 7.5 - 7.2 (m, 6, Haryl), 3.17 (s, 3, OMe), 3.14 and 3.11 (septet, 2 each, CHMe2 and C'HMe2), 2.48 (t, 2, J = 5.8, CH2 C(O)), 1.75 (t, 2, J = 5.8, PdCH2), 1.38, 1.32, 1.25 and 1.22 (d, 6 each, J = 6.8, CHMeMe' and C'HMeMe'), 0.73 (pentet, 2, J = 5.8, PdCH2 CH2 CH2 C(O)); 13 C NMR (CD2 Cl2, 100 MHz, rt) \u03b4 183.9 (C(O)), 167.1 (JCH = 181.4, N\u2550C(H)), 160.7 (JCH = 181.3, N\u2550C'(H)), 142.9 and 142.4 (Ar, Ar': Cipso), 139.7 and 138.7 (Ar, Ar': Cipso), 129.8 and 129.0 (Ar, Ar': Cp), 124.6 and 124.1 (Ar, Ar': Cm), 55.2 (OMe), 35.9 and 32.3 (PdCH2 CH2 CH2 C(O)), 29.3 and 29.1 (CHMe2, C'HMe2), 23.8 (PdCH2 CH2 CH2 C(O)), 24.5, 23.9, 23.2 and 22.5 (CHMeMe', C'HMeMe'); IR (CH2 Cl2) 1640 cm-1 \u03bd(C(O))!. 5'(H,Me): 13 C NMR (CD2 Cl2, 100 MHz, rt) \u03b4 193.2 (C(O)). Anal. Calcd for (C63 H57 BF24 N2 O2 Pd): C, 52.28; H, 3.97; N, 1.94. Found: C, 52.08; H, 3.75; N, 1.61., 308815=Relatively moncoordinating anions are known in the art, and the coordinating ability of such anions is known and has been discussed in the literature, see for instance W. Beck., et al., Chem. Rev., vol. 88 p. 1405-1421 (1988), and S. H. Strauss, Chem. Rev., vol. 93 p. 927-942 (1993), both of which are hereby included by reference. Among such anions are those formed from the aluminum compounds in the immediately preceding paragraph and X-, including R9 s AlX-, R9 AlCl2 X-, and \"R9 AlOX- \". Other useful noncoordinating anions include BAF- {BAF=tetrakis 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl!borate}, SbF6 -, PF6 -, and BF4 31 , trifluoromethanesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, (Rf SO2) 2 N-, and (C6 F5) 4 B., 145858=said polymer has at least 50 branches per 1000 methylene groups;, 710242=The complex (2,4,6-MePh)2 DABAn!NiBr2 was weighed into a glass vial in the dry box (0.0093 g, 0.0146 mmol). Cyclopentene (10.0 g, 10,000 equivalents/Ni) and anhydrous methylene chloride (48.5 ml) were added. A solution of EtAlCl2 was added while stirring (2.92 ml, 1.0 M in toluene, 200 equivalents/Ni). After stirring for 163 hours, the solution was filtered and the solids were washed several times on the filter with pentane. The polymer was dried in vacuo for 12 hours at room temperature to yield 1.64 g of fine powder (1640 turnovers/Ni). A DSC thermal fractionation experiment was done according to the procedure of Example 312. A DSC was then recorded from 0\ufffd C. to 330\ufffd C. at 10\ufffd C./min. Tg=92\ufffd C., Tm (onset)=150\ufffd C., Tm (end)=250\ufffd C., Heat of fusion=11.4 J/g., 387044=A 100 mL autoclave was charged with chloroform (50 mL), { 2-t-BuPh)2DABMe2 !PdMe(NCMe)}SbF6 - (0.090 g, 0.12 mmol), and ethylene (2.1 MPa). The reaction mixture was stirred at 25\ufffd C. and 2.1 MPa ethylene for 3 h. The ethylene pressure was then vented and volatiles removed from the reaction mixture in vacuo to afford 2.695 g of branched polyethylene. The number average molecular weight (Mn), calculated by 1 H NMR integration of aliphatic vs. olefinic resonances, was 1600. The degree of polymerization, DP, calculated on the basis of the 1 H NMR spectrum to be 59; for a linear polymer this would result in 18 methyl-ended branches per 1000 methylenes. However, based on the 1 H NMR spectrum the number of methyl-ended branches per 1000 methylenes was calculated to be 154. Therefore, it may be concluded that this material was branched polyethylene. 1 H NMR (CDCl3) \u03b4 5.38 (mult, vinyl H's), 1.95 (mult, allylic methylenes), 1.62 (mult, allylic methyls), 1.24 (mult, non-allylic methylenes and methines), 0.85 (mult, non-allylic methyls)., 470741=The complex (2,6-i-PrPh)2 DABMe2 !PdMeCl (0.020 g, 0.036 mmol) was weighed into a vial and dissolved in 6 ml CH2 Cl2. NaBAF (0.032 g, 0.036 mmol) was rinsed into the stirring mixture with 4 ml of CH2 Cl2. There was an immediate color change from orange to yellow. The solution was stirred under 6.2 MPa ethylene in a Fisher Porter tube with temperature control at 19\ufffd C. The internal temperature rose to 22\ufffd C. during the first 15 minutes. The temperature controller was raised to 30\ufffd C. After 35 minutes, the reaction was consuming ethylene slowly. After a total reaction time of about 20 h, there was no longer detectable ethylene consumption, but the liquid level in the tube was noticeably higher. Workup by addition to excess MeOH gave a viscous liquid precipitate. The precipitate was redissolved in CH2 Cl2, filtered through a 0.5 micron PTFE filter and reprecipitated by addition to excess MeOH to give 7.208 g dark brown viscous oil (7180 equivalents of ethylene per Pd). 1 H NMR (CDCl3) 0.8-1.0 (m, CH3); 1.0-1.5 (m, CH and CH2). Integration allows calculation of branching: 118 methyl carbons per 1000 methylene carbons. GPC in THF vs. PMMA standard: Mn =12,700, Mw =28,800, Mw /Mn =2.26., 900216=Under a nitrogen atmosphere, Ni(COD)2 (0.017 g, 0.06 mmol) and MeC(\u2550N-2,6-C6 H3 -iPr2 (CH\u2550C(NH--C6 H3 -iPr2)Me (0.025 g, 0.06 mmol) were dissolved in benzene (5.0 mL). To the resulting solution was added HBAF (Et2 O)2 (0.060 g, 0.06 mmol). The resulting solution was immediately frozen inside a 40 mL shaker tube glass insert. The glass insert was transferred to a shaker tube, and its contents allowed to thaw under an ethylene atmosphere. The reaction mixture was agitated under 6.9 MPa C2 H4 for 40 h at ambient temperature. The final reaction mixture contained polyethylene, which was washed with methanol and dried; yield of polymer=1.37 g. Branching per 1000 CH2 's was determined by 13 C NMR (C6 D3 Cl3): Total methyls (10.2), methyl (8.8), Ethyl (1.1), Propyl (0), Butyl (0), \u2267Am and end of chains (3.2), \u2267Bu and end of chains (0.3), 264942=Homopolymers of \u03b1-olefins such as propylene, that is polymers which were made from a monomer that consisted essentially of a single monomer such as propylene, which are made herein, sometimes exhibit unusual properties compared to their \"normal\" homopolymers. For instance, such a homopolypropylene usually would have about 1000 methyl groups per 1000 methylene groups. Polypropylenes made herein typically have about half that many methyl groups, and in addition have some longer chain branches. Other \u03b1-olefins often give polymers whose microstructure is analogous to these polypropylenes when the above catalysts are used for the polymerization., 671542=A mixture of 10.2 mL (13.1 g; 81.2 mmol) 2-aminobenzotrifluoride and 3.6 mL (3.5 g; 41 mmol) freshly-distilled 2,3-butanedione in 15 mL methanol containing 6 drops of 98% formic acid was stirred at 35\ufffd C. under nitrogen for 8 days. The reaction mixture was rotovapped and the resultant crystalline solids (1.3 g) were washed with carbon tetrachloride. The crystals were dissolved in chloroform; the solution was passed through a short alumina column and evaporated to yield 1.0 g of yellow crystals of the diimine (2-CF3 Ph)2 DABMe2. 1 H NMR analysis (CDCl3): 2.12 ppm (s, 6H, CH3); 6.77 (d, 2H, ArH, J=9 Hz); 7.20 (t, 2H, ArH, J=7 Hz); 7.53 (t, 2H, ArH, J=7 Hz); 7.68 (t, 2H, ArH, J=8 Hz). Infrared spectrum: 1706, 1651, 1603, 1579, 1319, 1110 cm-1. Mp: 154\ufffd-156\ufffd C., 341854=To a mixture of (2,6-MePh)2 DABMe2 !PdMeCl (109.5 mg, 0.244 mmol) and NaBAF (216.0 mg, 0.244 mmol) were added 20 mL each of Et2 O and CH2 Cl2 and 1 mL of CH3 CN. The reaction mixture was then stirred for 1.5 h and then the NaCl was removed via filtration. Removal of the solvent in vacuo yielded a yellow powder, which was washed with 50 mL of hexane. The product (269.6 mg, 83.8%) was then dried in vacuo: 1 H NMR (CD2 Cl2, 400 MHz) \u03b4 7.73 (s, pb 8, BAF:Ho), 7.57 (s, 4, BAF:Hp), 7.22-7.16 (m, 6, Haryl), 2.23 (s, 6, Ar:Me), 2.17 (s, 6, Ar':Me), 2.16, 2.14, and 1.79 (s, 3 each, N=C(Me)-C'(Me)=N, NCMe), 0.38 (s, 3, PdMe); 13 C NMR (CD2 Cl2, 100 MHz) \u03b4 180.1 and 172.2 (N=C C'=N), 162.1 (q, JBC =49.9, BAF:Cipso), 142.9 (Ar, Ar':C0), 135.2 (BAF:Co), 129.3 (Ar:Cm), 129.2 (q, JCF =30.6, BAF:Cm), 129.0 (Ar+ :Cm), 128.4 (Ar:Cp), 128.2 (Ar:Co), 127.7 Ar':Cp), 127.4 (Ar':Co), 125.0 (q, JCF =272.4, BAF:CF3), 121.8 (NCMe), 117.9 (BAF:Cp), 20.2 and 19.2 (N=C(Me)-C'(Me)=N), 18.0 Ar:Me), 17.9 (Ar':Me), 5.1 and 2.3 (NCMe, PdMe). Anal. Calcd for (C55 H42 BF24 N3 Pd): C, 50.12; H, 3.21; N, 3.19. Found: C, 50.13; H, 3.13, N, 2.99., 682214=In a Schlenk flask, (2,6-i-PrPh)2 DABAn!NiBr2 (0.012 g, 0.017 mmol) and CH2 \u2550CH(CH2)4 (CF2)4 O(CF2)2 SO2 F (3.26 g, 6.77 mmol) were dissolved in 35 mL of toluene under stirring. This was pressured with 1 atm ethylene and was allowed to stir at 0\ufffd C. for 15 minutes. MAO (1.7 mL, 8.9 wt. % in toluene) was added. This was allowed to vigorously stir at RT for 45 minutes. Methanol (140 mL) was then added, followed by addition of 1 mL of conc. HCl. The white solid was filtered, followed by methanol wash, vacuum dried to obtain 2.76 g of a white rubbery polymer. 1 H NMR analysis (o-dichlorobenzene-d4, 100\ufffd C.): 98 methyls per 1000 methylene carbons. Comparison of the integral of the --CH2 CF2 -- (2.02 ppm) with the integrals of methyls (0.8-1.0 ppm) and methylenes (1.1-1.4 ppm) indicated a comonomer content of 3.5 mol %. 19 F NMF ((0-dichlorobenzene-d4): 45.19 ppm, --SO2 F; -82.70 ppm, -83.72 ppm, -112.96 ppm, -115.09 ppm, -124.37 ppm, -125.83 ppm, CF2 peaks. The polymer exhibited Tm of 97\ufffd C. by differential scanning calorimetry. Mw=156,000, Mn=90,000, P/D=173., 455896=A 53-mg (0.036-mmol) sample of { (2,6-i-PrPh)2 DABMe!PdCH2 CH2 C(O)CH3 }BAF- was placed in a 600-mL Parr\ufffd stirred autoclave under nitrogen. To this was added 100 mL of dry, deaerated methylene chloride. The autoclave was immersed in a cool water bath and stirred as it was pressurized to 4.8 MPa with ethylene. Ethylene was continuously fed with sirring at 4.8 MPa and 23\ufffd C. for 23 hr; the ethylene then was vented. The product consisted of a clear rubber, slightly swollen with methylene chloride. The polymer was dried under high vacuum at room temperature to yield 34.5 g (34,100 catalyst turnovers) of clear rubbery polyethylene. 1 H NMR analysis (CDCl3): 110 methyl carbons per 1000 methylene carbons. Gel permeation chromatography (trichlorobenzene, 135\ufffd C., polystyrene reference, results calculated as polyethylene using universal calibration theory): Mn =243,000; Mw =676,000; Mw /Mn =2.78., 561022=A 100 mL autoclave was charged with chloroform (40 mL), methyl acrylate (10 mL), { (2,6-EtPh)2 DABMe2 !PdMe (NCMe)}BAF- (0.100 g, 0.073 mmol), and ethylene (2.1 MPa). The reaction mixture was stirred under 1.4 MPa of ethylene for 180 min; during this time the temperature inside the reactor remained between 25 and 26\ufffd C. The ethylene pressure was then vented, and the crude reaction mixture discharged from the reactor. The reactor was washed with 2\ufffd50 mL of chloroform. The washings were added to the crude reaction mixture; 250 mL of methanol was added to the resulting solution. After standing overnight, the polymer product had precipitated from solution; it was isolated by decanting off the chloroform/methanol solution, and dried giving 3.91 g of an extremely viscous oil. 1 H NMR of this material showed it to be ethylene/methyl acrylate copolymer, containing 1.1 mole % methyl acrylate. The polymer contained 128 methyl-ended hydrocarbon branches per 1000 methylenes, and 7 methyl ester ended branches per 1000 methylenes., 713065=A mixture of 20 mg (0.032 mmol) of NiBr2 (2,6-i-PrPh)2 DABMe2 ! was magnetically-stirred under nitrogen in a 50-mL Schlenk flask with 15 mL of dry, deaerated toluene as 0.6 mL of 3M poly(methylalumoxane) was injected via syringe. The mixture became deep blue-black. Then 2.5 mL (14 mmol) of a beta-citronellene, (CH3)2 C\u2550CHCH2 CH2 CH(CH3)CH\u2550CH2, was injected and the mixture was immediately pressurized with ethylene at 190 kPa (absolute) and was stirred at 23\ufffd C. for 17 h; by the end of 17 h, the solution was too thick to stir. The ethylene was vented and the toluene solution was stirred with 6N HCl and methanol and was decanted.

Mn wascalculated on the basis of 1 H NMR integration of aliphatic vs. olefinic resonances to be approximately 2000. The degree of polymerization, DP, was calculated on the basis of the 1 H NMR spectrum to be 73; for a linear polymer this would result in 14 methyl-ended branches per 1000 methylenes. However, based on the 1 H NMR spectrum the number of methyl-ended branches per 1000 methylenes was calculated to be 377., 846604=The complex (2,6-iPrPh)2 DABMe2 !PdCl2 was weighed (29 mg, 0.050 mmol) into a glass vial inside a dry box.

Jerschow et al, Macromolecules 1995, 28, 7095-7099. The triads and pentads are described as 1-cme, 1,3-ccmcc, 1,3-cmc, 2- cme, 2-cmc, 1,3-eme, 3-cme, and 4,5-cmc, where e=ethylene, c=cyclopentene, and m=meta cyclopentene (i.e. 1,3 enchainment). the same labeling is used for cyclopentene/1-pentene copolymer substituting p=pentene for e. The synthesis of diimines is reported in the literature (Tom Dieck, H.; Svoboda, M.; Grieser, T. Z. Naturforsch 1981, 36b, 823-832. Kliegman J. M.; Barnes, R. K. J. Org. Chem. 1970, 35, 3140-3143.), 240488=Homopolymers of polypropylene (P) can also have unusual structures. Similar effects have been observed with other \u03b1-olefins (e.g. 1- hexene). A \"normal\" P homopolymer will have one methyl group for each methylene group (or 1000 methyl groups per 1000 methylene groups), since the normal repeat unit is --CH(CH3)CH2 --. However, using a catalyst of formula (I) in which M is Ni(II) in combination with an alkyl aluminum compound it is possible to produce a P homopolymer with about 400 to about 600 methyl groups per 1000 methylene groups, preferably about 450 to about 550 methyl groups per 1000 methylene groups. Similar effects have been observed with other \u03b1-olefins (e.g. 1-hexene)., 269174=Copolymers of cyclopentene and various other olefins may also be made. For instance a copolymer of ethylene and cyclopentene may also be made. In such a copolymer it is preferred that at least 50 mole percent, more preferably at least about 70 mole percent, of the repeat units are derived from cyclopentene. As also noted above, many of the polymerization systems described herein produce polyethylenes that have considerable branching in them. Likewise the ethylene units which are copolymerized with the cyclopentene herein may also be branched, so it is preferred that there be at least 20 branches per 1000 methylene carbon atoms in such copolymers. In this instance, the \"methylene carbon atoms\" referred to in the previous sentence do not include methylene groups in the cyclopentene rings. Rather it includes methylen groups only derived from ethylene or other olefin, but not cyclopentene., 350668=Following the process of Example 17, a purple powder was obtained and stored at -30\ufffd C.: 1 H NMR (CD2 Cl2, 400 MHz, -80\ufffd C.; H2 O and Et2 O adducts were observed in an 80:20 ratio, respectively.) \u03b4 8.31 and 8.13 (s, 0.8 each, N\u2550C(H)--C'(H)\u2550N; H2 O Adduct), 8.18 and 8.00 (s, 0.2 each, N\u2550C(H)--C'(H)\u2550N; Et2 Adduct), 7.71 (s, 8 BAF: Co), 7.53 (s, 4, BAF: Cp), 7.5-7.0 (m, 6, Haryl), 4.21 (s, 1.6, OH2), 3.5-3.1 (m, 8, O(CH2 CH3)2, CHMe2, C'HMe2), 1.38, 1.16 and 1.08 (d, 4.8 each, CHMeMe', C'HMeMe'; H2 O Adduct; These peaks overlap with and obscure teh CHMe2 doublets of the Et2 O adduct.), 0.27 (s, 2.4, PdMe; H2 O Adduct), 0.12 (s, 0.6, PdMe: Et2 O Adduct)., 396298=A 100 mL autoclave was charged with FC-75 (50 mL), { 4-NMe2 Ph)2 DABMe2 !PdMe(MeCN)}SbF6 - (MeCN) (0.091 g, 0.12 mmol) and ethylene (2.1 MPa). The reaction mixture was stirred at 24\ufffd C. for 1.5 h. The ethylene pressure was then vented, and the cloudy FC-75 mixture removed from the reactor. The FC-75 was extracted with 3\ufffd25 mL of chloroform. The reactor was washed out with 3\ufffd40 mL CHCl3, and the washings added to the extracts. Volatiles removed from the resulting solution in vacuo to afford 556 mg of an oil. Mn was calculated on the basis of 1 H NMR integration of aliphatic vs. olefinic resonances to be 200. The degree of polymerization, DP, was calculated on the basis of the 1 H NMR spectrum to be 8.4; for a linear polymer this would result in 154 methyl-ended branches per 1000 methylenes. However, based on the 1 H NMR spectrum the number of methyl-ended branches per 1000 methylenes was calculated to be 261., 872924=Preparation of (2,5-t-BuPh)2 DABAn!PdMe2 from (1,5-cyclooctadiene)PdMe2. The Pd(II) precursor (1,5-cyclooctadiene)PdMe2 ((COD)PdMe2) was prepared according reported procedures (Rudler-Chauvin, M.; Rudler, H. J. Organomet. Chem., 1977, 134, 115.) and was handled using Schlenk techniques at temperatures of -10\ufffd C. or below. A flame-dried Schlenk tube was charged with 0.102 g (0.417 mmol) of (COD)PdMe2 and cooled to -30\ufffd C. in a dry ice/isopropanol bath. The solid was dissolved in 10 mL of ether, and the diimine (2,5-t-BuPh)2 DABAn (0.234 g, 0.420 mmol) was cannulated onto the stirring solution as a slurry in 40 mL of ether. The reaction was warmed to 0\ufffd C. and stirring was continued for four hours. The reaction flask was stored at -30\ufffd C. overnight. The resulting dark green solution was filtered and the solvent was pulled off under high vacuum to give a dark green powder. Analysis by 1 H NMR spectroscopy showed the solid to be consistent with the desired product, (2,5-t-BuPh)2 DABAn!PdMe2. Yield=0.256 g (0.370 mmol, 88.7%)., 615585=Methyl vinyl ketone was stirred over anhydrous K2 CO3 and vacuum transferred on a high vacuum line to a dry flask containing phenothiazine (50 ppm). Ethylene and methyl vinyl ketone (5 ml) were copolymerized according to Example 16 using catalyst { (2,6-i-PrPh)2 DABMe2 ! PdCH2 CH2 CH2 C(O)OCH3 }+ SbF6 - (0.084 g, 0.10 mmol) to give 0.46 g copolymer (0.38 g after correcting for catalyst residue). 1 H- NMR (CDCl3): 0.75-0.95 (m, CH3); 0.95-1.45 (m, CH and CH2); 1.55 (m, --CH2 CH2 C(O)CH3); 2.15 (s, --CH2 CH2 C(O)CH3); 2.4 (t, --CH2 CH2 C(O)CH3). Based on the triplet at 2.15, it appears that much of the ketone functionality is located on the ends of hydrocarbon branches. Integration shows that the copolymer contains 2.1 mole % methyl vinyl ketone, and 94 methyl carbons (exclusive of methyl ketones) per 1000 methylene carbons. The turnover numbers are 128 equivalents of ethylene and 3 equivalents of methyl vinyl ketone per Pd. GPC (THF, PMMA standard): Mn=5360 Mw=7470 Mw/Mn=1.39., 375903=(2,6-EtPh)2 DABMe2 !PdMeCl (0.20 g, 0.396 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of acetonitrile to give an orange solution. to this was added NABAF (0.350 g, 0.396 mmol). The reaction mixture turned bright yellow and NaCl precipitated. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min and then filtered through a Celite\ufffd pad. The Celite\ufffd pad was extracted with 5 mL of acetonitrile. The combined filtrate and extract was concentrated in vacuo to afford an orange solid, recrystallization of which from methylene/chloride/petroleum ether at -40\ufffd C. afforded 0.403 g of the title compound as orange crystals (Yield=74%). 1 H NMR (CDCl3) \u03b4 7.68 ) (s, 8H, hortho of anion), 7.51 (s, 4H, Hpara of anion), 7.33-7.19 (mult, 6H, Haryl of cation), 2.56-2.33 (mult, 8H CH2 CH3), 2.11 (s, 3H, N\u2550CMe), 2.09 (s, 3H, N\u2550CMe'), 1.71 (s, 3H, N.tbd.CMe), 1.27-1.22 (mult, 12H, CH2 CH3), 0.41 (s, 3H, Pd--Me)., 448658=A 108-mg (0.073 mmol) sample of { (2,6-i-PrPh)2 DABMe2 !PdCH2 CH2 C(O)CH3 }BAF- was placed in a 600-mL Parr\ufffd stirred autoclave under nitrogen. To this was added via syringe 75 mL of deaerated reagent grade methyl acrylate containing 100 ppm hydroquinone monomethyl ether and 100 ppm of phenothiazine. The autoclave ws pressurized to 5.5 MPa with ethylene and was stirred at 35\ufffd C. as ethylene was continuously fed for 90 hr; the ethylene was then vented. The product consisted of a swollen clear foam wrapped around the impeller; 40 mL of unreacted methyl acrylate was poured off the polymer. The polymer was stripped off the impeller and was held under high vacuum to yield 38.2 g of clear, grayish, somewhat-tacky rubber. 1 H NMR analysis (CDCl3): 99 methyl carbons per 1000 methylene carbons. Comparison of the integrals of the ester methoxy (3.67 ppm) and ester methylene (CH2 COOMe; 2.30 ppm) peaks with the integrals of the carbonchain methyls (0.8-0.9 ppm) and methylenes (1.2-1.3 ppm) indicated a methyl acrylate content of 0.9 mol % (2.6 wt %). This product yield and composition represent 18,400 ethylene turnovers and 158 methyl acrylate turnovers. 13 C NMR analysis: branching per 1000 CH2 ; total Methyls (105.7), Methyl (36.3), Ethyl (22), Propyl (4.9), Butyl (10.6), Amyl (4), \u2267Hex and End Of Chain (27.8), methyl acrylate (3.4); ester-bearing --CH(CH2)n CO2CH3 branches as a % of total ester: n\u22675 (40.6), n=1,2,3, (2.7), n=0 (56.7); chemical shifts were referenced to the solvent: the high field carbon of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (127.8 ppm).

The reactor was washed out with 2\ufffd50 mL CHCl3, and the washings added to the oil. Volatiles removed from the resulting solution in vacuo to afford 144 mg of an oily solid. Mn was calculated on the basis of 1 H NMR integration of aliphatic vs. olefinic resonances to be 400. The degree of polymerization, DP, was calculated on the basis of the 1 H NMR spectrum to be 13.8; for a linear polymer this would result in 83 methyl-ended branches per 1000 methylenes. However, based on the 1 H NMR spectrum the number of methyl-ended branches per 1000 methylenes was calculated to be 288., 770543=A 1.5 mg (2.4\ufffd10-6 mol) sample of (2,6-i-PrPh)2 DABMe2 !NiBr2 and 200 mL of dry toluene was added to a Parr\ufffd 1000 mL stirred autoclave under an argon atmosphere. The reactor was heated to 80\ufffd C. and purged with ethylene before addition of 3.0 mL of a 7% MMAO solution in heptane. The autoclave was rapidly pressurized with ethylene to 2.1 MPa. After 10 min, the ethylene was vented and acetone and water were added to quench the reaction. Solid polyethylene was recovered from the reactor collected and washed with 6 M HCl, H2 O, and acetone. The resulting polymer dried under high vacuum overnight to yield 1.05 g (0.9\ufffd105 TO/h) of polyethylene.

PMAO (1 ml, 9.6 wt % Al) was added. The solution immediately turned deep blue/black and in less than a minute became extremely viscous. The reaction was quenched after 15 hours by addition of MeOH/10% HCl causing the polymer to precipitate. The solid was filtered, washed well with MeOH and finally with a 2% Irganox\ufffd 1010 in acetone solution. The polymer was cut into pieces and dried. Yield=0.8 g (40%). 1 H-NMR (ODCB, 120\ufffd C.): 1.0-2.5 ppm complex multiplet confirms that the product is an addition polymer. The absence of olefinic peaks precludes the existence of ROMP product and indicates that the polymer is not of extremely low molecular weight., 866058=Preparation of highly chain-straightened polypropylene with a low Tg. The complex (2-t-BuPh)2 DABAn!NiBr2 (0.0133 g, 2.0\ufffd10-5 mol) was placed into a flame-dried 250 mL Schlenk flask which was then evacuated and back-filled with propylene. Freshly distilled toluene (100 mL) was added via syringe and the resulting solution was stirred in a water bath at room temperature. Polymerization was initiated by addition of methylaluminoxane (MAO; 1.5 mL 10% soln in toluene) and a propylene atmosphere was maintained throughout the course of the reaction.

Ethylene was continuously fed 414 kPa with stirring at 23\ufffd-25\ufffd C. for 3 hr; then the feed was shut off and the reaction was stirred for 12 hr more. At the end of this time, the autoclave was under 89.6 kPa (absolute). The autoclave was repressurized to 345 kPa with ethylene and stirred for 2 hr more as the pressure dropped to 255 kPa, showing that the catalyst was still active; the ethylene was then vented.

The turnover numbers for ethylene and the comonomer are 6,122 and 183, respectively., 783555=A 12-mg (0.022 mmol) sample of (Ph)DABAn!NiBr2 was placed in a 1000 mL stirred autoclave under an argon atmosphere with 200 mL of deaerated toluene (reactor temperature was 25\ufffd C.). The reactor was purged with ethylene and 2 mL (100 eq) of a 10% MAO solution in toluene was added to the suspension. The autoclave was rapidly pressurized to 4.1 MPa and the reaction was stirred for 60 minutes. A 20\ufffd C. exotherm was observed. The oligomerization was quenched upon addition of acetone and water.

Distribution of isolated oligomers by GC analysis: C10 =13%, C12 =30%, C14 =26%, C16 =18%, C18 =10%, C20 =3%. All C4, C6, C8 and some C10 was lost during work-up., 476750=Polymerization of ethylene was carried out according to example 112, using distilled degassed water as the medium. Water is a non-solvent for both the Pd complex and the polymer product. The mixture was worked up by decanting the water from the product which was then dried in vacuo to give 0.427 g of dark sticky solid (152 equivalents of ethylene per Pd). 1 H NMR analysis (CDCl3): 97 methyl carbons per 1000 methylene carbons. GPC (trichlorobenzene, 135\ufffd C., polystyrene reference, results calculated as linear polyethylene using universal calibration theory): Mn =25,100, Mw =208,000, Mw /Mn =8.31., 399633=A 100 mL autoclave was charged with Pd(CH3 CH2 CN)4 ! (BAF4)2 (0.058 g, 0.12 mmol) and chloroform (40 mL). To this was added a solution of (2,6-i-PrPh)2 DABMe2 (0.070 g, 0.17 mmol) dissolved n 10 mL of chloroform under ethylene pressure (2.1 MPa). The pressure was maintained at 2.1 MPa for 1.5 h, during which time the temperature inside the reactor increased from 22 to 35\ufffd C. The ethylene pressure was then vented and the reaction mixture removed from the reactor. The reactor was washed with 3\ufffd5 mL of chloroform, the washings added tot he reaction mixture, and volatiles removed from the resulting solution in vacuo to afford 9.77 g ofa viscous oil. 1 H NMR of this material showed it to be branched polyethylene with 96 methyl-ended branches per 1000 methylenes., 600755=A 73-mg (0.049 mmol) sample of { (2,6-i-PrPh)2 DABMe2 !PdCH2 CH2 CH2 C(O)OCH3 }BAF- was placed in a 600-mL stirred autoclave under nitrogen with 150 mL of deaerated water; to this was added 3.1 mL (3.3 g) of Triton\ufffd X-100 nonionic surfactant. This mixture was pressurized to 5.8 MPa with ethylene and was stirred at 23\ufffd C. for 17 hr. When the ethylene was vented, most of the emulsion came out the valve due to foaming; it was caught in a flask. There was polymer suspended in the emulsion; this was filtered to give, after MeOH and acetone washing and air-drying, 2.9 g of amorphous polyethylene as a fine, gray rubber powder. The filtrate from the suspended polymer was a clear gray solution; this was concentrated on a hot plate to yield recovered Triton\ufffd X-100 and palladium black.

Gel permeation chromatography (trichlorobenzene, 135\ufffd C., polystyrene reference, results calculated as polyethylene using universal calibration theory): Mn =31,000; Mw =311,000; Mw /Mn =10.0. This example demonstrates the aqueous emulsion polymerization of ethylene in the presence of a non-ionic surfactant., 896938=A flame-dried 250 mL Schlenk flask was charged with 0.1384 g (1.007\ufffd10-4 mol) of (2-t-BuPh)2 DABMe2 !PdMe(NCMe)BAF- in the glove box. The flask was twice evacuated and back-filled with ethylene and then cooled to -60\ufffd C. The solid was dissolved in 100 mL of CH2 Cl2 and the flask was allowed to warm to room temperature with stirring under an atmosphere of ethylene. After stirring for 23 h the polymerization was quenched with methanol. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the polymer was dissolved in petroleum ether and filtered through silica gel. The filtrate was concentrated and the remaining solvent was removed under vacuum to give a clear, colorless, viscous liquid. Yield=2.40 g. 1 H NMR analysis: 123 Me/1000 CH2., 847666=The complex (2,6-iPrPh)2 DABMe2 !PdCl2 was weighed (29 mg, 0.050 mmol) into a glass vial inside a dry box. Cyclopentene was added (6.81 g, 2000 equivalents per Pd; distilled from polyphosphoric acid), and the vial was cooled to <0\ufffd C. A solution of EtAlCl2 in hexane (1.7 mL, 1.0M, 34 equivalents per Pd) was added with stirring to give a homogeneous solution. After 4 days, the solids were collected by vacuum filtration, washed several times on the filter with ether and cyclohexane, then dried in a vacuum oven to give 1.427 g polymer (419 turnovers/Pd). The polymer was coated with 5000 ppm Irganox\ufffd 1010 by evaporating an acetone slurry and drying in a vacuum oven. The polymer was pressed at 290\ufffd C. into a transparent, gray-brown, tough film. DSC (25\ufffd to 330\ufffd C., 10\ufffd C./min, second heat): Tg =103\ufffd C., Tm (onset to end)=153\ufffd to 256\ufffd C., heat of fusion=23 J/g., 248303=As will be understood from the above discussion, the lenths of the branches (\"f\") do not necessarily correspond to the original sizes of the monomers used (\"e\"). Indeed branch lengths are often present which do not correspond to the sizes of any of the monomers used and/or a branch length may be present \"in excess\". by \"in excess\" is meant there are more branches of a particular length present than there were monomers which corresponded to that branch length in the polymer. For instance, in the copolymerization of 75 mole percent ethylene and 25 mole percent 1-butene it would be expected that there would be 125 ethyl branches per 1000 methylene carbon atoms. If there were more ethyl branches than that, they would be in excess compared to the theoretical branching. There may also be a deficit of specific length branches. If there were less than 125 ethyl branches per 1000 methylene groups in this polymer there would be a deficit. Preferred polymers have 90% or less or 110% or more of the theoretical amount of any branch length present in the polymer, and it is especially preferred if these branches are about 80% or less or about 120% or more of the theoretical amount of any branch length. In the case of the 75 mole percent ethylen/25 mole percent 1-buten polymer, the 90% would be about 113 ethyl branches or less, while the 110% would be about 138 ethyl branches or more. Such polymers may also or exclusively contain at least 50 branches per 1000 methylene atoms with lengths which sould not theoretically (as described above) be present at all., 679680={ (2,6-i-PrPh)2 DABMe2 !PdCH2 CH2 CH2 C(O)OCH3 }+ SbF6 - (0.0205 g, 0.024 mmol) and CH2 =CH(CH2)4 (CF2)4 O(CF2)2 SO2 F (3.5 g, 7.26 mmol) were dissolved in 18 mL CH2 Cl2 in a Schlenk flask in a drybox. The flask was connected to a Schlenk line and the flask was then briefly evacuated and refilled with ethylene from the Schlenk line. This was stirred at RT under 1 atm of ethylene for 72 hr. Solvent was evaporated after filtration. The viscous oil was dissolved in 10 mL CH2 Cl2, followed by addition of 100 mL methanol. The upper layer was decanted. The reverse precipitation was repeated two more time, followed by vacuum drying to yield 3.68 g of a light yellow viscous oil. 1 H NMR analysis (CDCl3): 89 methyls per 1000 methylene carbons. Comparison of the integral of the CH2 CF2 -- (2.02 ppm) with the integrals of methyls (0.8-1.0 ppm) and methylenes (1.1-1.4 ppm) indicated a comonomer content of 8.5 mol %. 19 F NMR (CDCL3): 45.27 ppm, --SO2 F; -82.56 ppm, -83.66 ppm, -112.82 ppm, -115.34 ppm, -124.45 ppm, -125.85 ppm, CF2 peaks. The polymer exhibited a glass transition temperature of -57\ufffd C. by differential scanning calorimetry. Gel permeation chromatography THF, polystyrene standard): Mw=120,000, Mn=78,900, P/D=1.54.

To this mixture, 0.5 mL of 3M poly (Methylalumoxane) in toluene was added via syringe; the resulting burgundy catalyst solution was stirred at 5\ufffd C. for 40 min. Into the addition funnel was condensed (via a Dry Ice condenser on the top of the funnel) 20 mL (about 15 g) of 1-butene. The catalyst solution was stirred as the 1-butene was added as a liquid all at once. The reaction temperature rose to 50\ufffd C. over 30 min and then dropped to room temperature as the mixture was stirred for 4 hr. The product solution was treated wtih 1 mL of methanol and was filtered through diatomaceous earth; rotary evaporation yielded 6.17 g (1640 catalyst turnovers) of clear, tacky poly-1-butene rubber.

This example demonstrates the polymerization of an alpha-olefin and shows the difference in branching between a polymer derived from 1-olefin (this example) and a polymer derived from 2-olefin (Example 78). This difference shows that the internal olefin of Example 78 is not first isomerized to an alpha-olefin before polymerizing; thus this catalyst is truly able to polymerize internal olefins., 562186=A solution of { (Np)2 DABMe2 !PdMe (NCMe)}SbF6 - (0.027 g, 0.02 mmol) in 5 mL CDCl3 was agitated under 1.4 MPa of ethylene for 3 h; during this time the temperature inside the reactor varied between 25 and 40\ufffd C. 1 H NMR of the solution indicated the presence of ethylene oligomers. Mn was calculated on the basis of 1 H NMR integration of aliphatic vs. olefinic resonances to be 100. The degree of polymerization, DP, was calculated on the basis of the 1 H NMR spectrum to be 3.8; for a linear polymer this would result in 500 methyl-ended branches per 1000 methylenes. However, based on the 1 H NMR spectrum the number of methyl-ended branches per 1000 methylenes was calculated to be 787., 550122=Ethyl 10-undecenoate (10 ml) and ethylene (1 atm) were copolymerized in 30 ml of CH2 Cl2 according to example 125 using catalyst { (2,6-i-PrPh)2 DABMe2 !PdCH2 CH2 CH2 C(O)OCH3 }SbF6 - (0.084 g, 0.10 mmol). The copolymer was precipitated by removing most of the CH2 Cl2 in vacuo, followed by addition of excess acetone. The solution was decanted and the copolymer was dried in vacuo to give 1.35 g viscous fluid. 1 H NMR (CDCl3): 0.75-0.95(m, CH3); 0.95-1.5(m, --C(O)OCH2CH3, CH2, CH); 1.5-1.7(m, --CH2 CH2 C(O)OCH2 CH3); 1.9-2.0(m, --CH2 CH=CH--); 2.3(t,--CH2 CH2 C(O)OCH2 CH3); 4.15(q, --CH2 CH2 C(O)OCH2 CH3); 5.40(m, --CH=CH--). The olefinic and allylic peaks are due to isomerized ethyl 10-undecenoate which has coprecipitated with the copolymer. Adjusting for this, the actual weight of copolymer in this sample is 1.18 g. The copolymer was reprecipitated by addition of excess acetone to a chloroform solution. 1 H NMR of the reprecipitated polymer is similar except there are no peaks due to isomerized ethyl 10-undecenoate at 1.9-2.0 and 5.40 ppm. Based on integration, the reprecipitated copolymer contains 7.4 mole % ethyl 10-undecenoate, and 83 methyl carbons per 1000 methylene carbons. 13 C NMR quantitative analysis, branching per 1000 CH2 : Total methyls (84.5), Methyl (31.7), Ethyl (16.9), Propyl (1.5), Butyl (7.8), Amyl (4.4), \u2273Hexyl and end of chains (22.3).

During this time the reaction temperature varied between 23 and 41\ufffd C. A viscous oil (329 mg) was isolated from the reaction mixture by decanting off the FC-75 and dried in vacuo. Mn was calculated on the basis of 1 H NMR integration of aliphatic vs. olefinic resonances to be 700. The degree of polymerization, DP, was calculated on the basis of the 1 H NMR spectrum to be 24.1; for a linear polymer this would result in 45 methyl-ended branches per 1000 methylenes. However, based on the 1 H NMR spectrum the number of methyl-ended branches per 1000 methylenes was calculated to be 173., 395288=A 100 mL autoclave was charged with FC-75 (50 mL), ({Ph2 DAB(cyclo --CMe2 CH2 CMe2 --)}PdMe(MeCN))BAF- (0.160 g, 0.12 mmol) and ethylene (2.1 MPa). The reaction mixture was stirred at 24\ufffd-25\ufffd C. for 3.5 h. The ethylene pressure was then vented, and the cloudy FC-75 mixture removed from the reactor. The FC-75 mixture was extracted with chloroform, and the chloroform extract concentrated to dryness affording 0.98 g of an oil Mn was calculated on the basis of 1 H NMR integration of aliphatic vs. olefinic resonances to be 500. The degree of polymerization, DP, was calculated on the basis of the 1 H NMR spectrum to be 19.5; for a linear polymer this would result in 57 methyl-ended branches per 1000 methylenes.

The mixture was stirred at 23\ufffd C. for 40 min to give a deep blue-green solution of catalyst. Dry, deaerated cyclopentene (10 mL) was injected and the mixture was stirred for 5 min. The flask was then pressurized with ethylene at 20.7 MPa and stirred for 22 hr. The resulting viscous solution was poured into a stirred mixture of 200 mL methanol and 10 mL 6 N HCl. The methanol was decanted off and replaced with fresh methanol, and the polymer was stirred in boiling methanol for 3 hr. The tough, stretchy rubber was pressed between paper towels and dried under vacuum to yield 1.0 g of poly!ethylene/cyclopentene!. By 1 H NMR analysis (CDCl3): 100 methyl carbons per 1000 methylene carbons. Comparison of the peaks attributable to cyclopentene (0.65 ppm and 1.75 ppm) with the standard polyethylene peaks (0.9 ppm and 1.3 ppm) indicates about a 10 mol % cyclopentene incorporation. This polymer yield and composition represent about 2900 catalyst turnovers. Differential scanning calorimetry: -44\ufffd C. (Tg). Gel permeation chromatography (tirchlorobenzene, 135\ufffd C., polystyrene reference, results calculated as polyethylene using universal calibration theory): Mn =122,000; Mw =241,000; Mw /Mn =1.97., 246648=For some of the polymerizations described herein, the actual amount of branching present in the polymer is considerably greater than or less than the above theoretical branching calculations would indicate. For instance, when an ethylene homopolymer is made, there should be no branches, yet there are often many such branches. When an \u03b1-olefin is polymerized, the branching level may be much lower or higher than the theoretical branching level. It is preferred that the actual branching level is at 90% or less of the theoretical branching level, more preferably about 80% or less of the theoretical branching level, more preferably about 120% or more of the theoretical branching level. The polymer should also have at least about 50 branches per 1000 methylene units, preferably about 75 branches per 1000 methylene units, and more preferably about 100 branches per 1000 methylene units. In cases where there are \"0\" branches theoretically present, as in ethylene homopolymers of copolymers with acrylics, excess branches as a percentage cannot be calculated. In that instance if the polymer has 50 or more, preferably 75 or more branches per 1000 methylene groups, it has excess branches (i.e. in branches in which f>0)., 837100=(2,6-iPrPh)2 DABMe2 !CoMe2 (15 mg) was dissolved in benzene (10 ml in a shaker tube) and the solution frozen. Montmorillionite K-10 (100 mg, conditioned at 600\ufffd C. for 48 hrs under vacuum) suspended in benzene (10 ml) was added on top of the frozen layer and frozen as well.

To this was added a +40\ufffd C. solution of methyl acrylate (1.85 g, 21.5 mmol) dissolved in 100 ml of methylene chloride. The resulting orange solution was stirred for 10 min, while being allowed to warm to room temperature. The reaction was then concentrated to dryness, affording a yellow-brown solid. The crude product was extracted with methylene chloride, and the orange-red extract concentrated, layered with an equal volume of petroleum ether, and cooled to -40\ufffd C.

GPC (THF, PMMA standard): Mn =6400 Mw =11,200 Mw /Mn =1.76., 317359=In the Examples, the following procedure was used to quantitatively determine branching, and the distribution of branch sizes in the polymers (but not necessarily the simple number of branches as measured by total number of methyl groups per 1000 methylene groups). 100 MHz 13 C NMR spectra were obtained on a Varian Unity 400 MHz spectrometer using a 10 mm probe on typically 15-20 wt % solutions of the polymers and 0.05M Cr(acetylacetonate3 in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) unlocked at 120-140 \ufffd C. using a 90 degree pulse of 12.5 to 18.5 \u03bcsec, a spectral width of 26 to 35 kHz, a relaxation delay of 5-9 s, an acquisition time of 0.64 sec and gated decoupling. Samples were preheated for at least 15 min before acquiring data. Data acquisition time was typically 12 hr. per sample. The T1 values of the carbons were measured under these conditions to be all less than 0.9 s. The longest T1 measured was for the Bu+, end of chain resonance at 14 ppm, which was 0.84 s. Occasionally about 16 vol. % benzene-d6 was added to the TCB and the sample was run locked. Some samples were run in chloroform-d1, CDCl3 -d1, (locked) at 30\ufffd C. under similar acquisition parameters. T1 's were also measured in CDCl3 at ambient temperature on a typical sample with 0.05M Cr(acetylacetonate)3 to be all less than 0.68 s. In 30-40 s recycle delay was used to insure quantitation. The glycidyl acrylate copolymer was run at 100\ufffd C. with Cr(acetylacetonate)3.

There seemed to be significant low-boiling species present, probably low-mw ethylene oligomers, which continued to boil off under high vacuum. 1 H NMR (CDCl3 ; 60\ufffd C.) of the product showed a CH2 :CH3 ratio of 206:17, which is 57 CH3 's per 1000 CH2 's. There were vinyl peaks at 5-5.8 ppm; if the end groups are considered to be vinyls rather than internal olefins, the degree of polymerization was about 34., 489136=Polymerization of ethylene was carried out according to example 112, using the complex { (2,6-i-PrPh)2 DABH2 !PdCH2 CH2 CH2 C(O)OCH3 }SbF6 - (0.082 g, 0.10 mmol) as the initiator and CHCl3 as the solvent. The reaction gave 4.47 g of low viscosity fluid (1600 equivalents of ethylene per Pd). 1 H NMR (CDCl3) is similar to example 120. Integration of the olefin end groups assuming one olefin per chain gives Mn =880 (DP=31). A linear polymer with this molecular weight and methyl groups at both ends should have 34 methyl carbons per 1000 methylene carbons. The value measured by integration is 156, thus this polymer is highly branched., 725752=The above synthesis was followed using (2,6-i-PrPh)2 DABAn!PdMeCl (744 mg, 1.13 mmol), NaBAF (1.00 g, 1.13 mmol), and MA (112 \u03bcL, 1.1 equiv). The reaction mixture was stirred for 2 days and the product was recrystallized from CH2 Cl2 at -30\ufffd C. to give 600 mg (33.8%, 2 crops) of a mixture of 6c(Me) (85%), 5'c(Me) (8%), 5\"c(Me) (6%), and 5c(Me) (1%), according to 1 H NMR spectroscopy. 6c(Me): 1 H NMR (CD2 Cl2) 400 MHz, rt) \u03b4 8.17 (d, 1, J = 8.37, An: Hp), 8.15 (d, 1, J = 3.49, An': H'p), 7.62 - 7.40 (m, 8, An, An': Hm, H'm ; Ar: Hm, Hp ; Ar': H'm, H'p), 7.08 (d, 1, J =7.19, An: Ho), 6.60 (d, 1, J = 7.44, An': Ho), 3.37 (septet, 2, J = 6.79, CHMe2), 3.33 (septet, 2, J = 6.86, C'HMe2), 2.55 (t, 2, J = 5.93, CH2 C(O)), 1.79 (t, 2, J = 5.66, PdCH2), 1.45, 1.42, 1.13 and 1.02 (d, 6 each, J = 6.79 - 6.90, CHMeMe', C'HMeMe'), 0.80 (pentet, 2, J = 5.82, PdCH2 CH2 CH2 C(O)); 13 C NMR (CD2 Cl2, 100 MHz, rt) \u03b4 183.5 (C(O)), 175.3 and 168.7 (N\u2550C--C'\u2550N), 145.9 An: quaternary C), 141.3 and 140.5 (Ar, Ar': Cipso), 139.7 and 138.4 (Ar, Ar':Co), 133.3 and 132.6 (An: CH), 131.9 (An: quaternary C), 129.8, 129.7, 129.6 and 128.5 (Ar, Ar': Cp ; An: CH), 126.44 and 125.8 (An: quaternary C), 126.4 and 125.6 (An: CH), 125.5 and 124.6 (Ar, Ar': Cm) 55.0 (OMe), 35.9 and 31.3 (PdCH2 CH2 CH2 C(O)), 29.7 and 29.4 (CHMe2 C'HMe2), 24.1 (PdCH2 CH2 CH2 C(O)), 24.1, 23.8, 23.32 and 23.27 (CHMeMe', C'HMeMe'); IR (CH2 Cl2) 1644 cm-1 \u03bd(C(O))!. 5c(Me): 1 H NMR (CD2 Cl2, 400 MHz, rt) \u03b4 3.64 (s, 3, OMe), 2.70 (m, 1, CHMeC(O)); 13 C NMR (CD2 Cl2, 100 MHz, rt) \u03b4 192.8 (C(O)). 5\"c(Me): 1 H NMR (CD2 Cl2, 400 MHz, rt) \u03b4 3.67 (s, 3, OMe), 2.46 t, 2, J = 6.99, CH2 C(O)), 1.72 (t, 2, J = 7.04, PdCH2). 5c(Me): 1 H NMR (CD2 Cl2, 400 MHz, rt) \u03b4 0.44 (d, 3, PdCHMe).

The solution was cooled to 0\ufffd C. and 0.1 mL of Et2 AlCl (\u227310 eq) was added. The reaction was stirred at 0\ufffd C. for 2 hours. The polymerization was quenched and the polymer precipitated from acetone. The resulting polymer was dried under reduced pressure (3.97 g, 2800 TO)., 812314=(acac)NiEt(PPh3) was synthesized according to published procedures (Cotton, F. A.; Frenz, B. A.; Hunter, D. L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1974, 96, 4820-4825)., 488183=Polymerization of ethylene was carried out according to example 112, using the complex (2,6-i-PrPh)2 DABMe2 !PdMe(OSO2 CF3) (0.068 g, 0.10 mmol) as the initiator and CHCl3 as the solvent. The reaction gave 5.98 g of low viscosity fluid (2130 equivalents of ethylene per Pd). 1 H NMR (CDCl3) 0.8-1.0 (m, CH3); 1.0-1.5 (m, CH and CH2); 1.5-1.7 (m, CH3 CH=CH--); 1.9-2.1 (broad, --CH2 CH=CHCH2 --); 5.3-5.5 (m, --CH=CH--). Integration of the olefin end groups assuming one olefin per chain gives Mn =630 (DP=24). A linear polymer with this molecular weight and methyl groups at both ends should have 46 methyl carbons per 1000 methylene carbons. The value measured by integration is 161, thus this polymer is highly branched., 641761=1-Tetradecene (20 ml) was polymerized in methylene chloride (10 ml) according to example 173 to give 6.11 g of sticky solid (622 equivalents 1-tetradecene per Pd). Integration of the 1 H NMR spectrum showed 64 methyl carbons per 1000 methylene carbons. 13 C NMR quantitative analysis, branching per 1000 CH2: Total methyls (66), Methyl (35.2), Ethyl (5.6), Propyl (1.2), Butyl (none detected), Amyl (2.1)., 884883=Under inert conditions, a flame-dried Schlenk tube was charged with 0.3040 g (0.8722 mmol) of (2-i-Pr-6-MePh)2 DABMe2, 0.2640 g (0.8533 mmol) of (DME)NiBr2 and 25 mL of CH2 Cl2. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir overnight. A solid was collected via filtration and washed with ether (2\ufffd10 mL). Upon sitting, more solid precipitated from the supernatant. This precipitate was isolated via filtration, washed with ether, and combined with the originally isolated product. The combined yellow/orange solids were dried under vacuum overnight (0.68 g, 94%)., 228441=Anions surprisingly also often affect molecular weight of the polymer formed. More highly coordinating anions often give lower molecular weight polymers. Although all of the anions useful herein are relatively weakly coordinating, some are more strongly coordinating than others. The coordinating ability of such anions is known and has been discussed in the literature, see for instance W. Beck., et al., Chem. Rev., vol. 88 p. 1405-1421 (1988), and S. H. Strauss, Chem. Rev., vol. 93, p. 927-942 (1993), both of which are hereby included by reference. The results found herein in which the molecular weight of the polymer produced is related to the coordinating ability of the anion used, is in line with the coordinating abilities of these anions as described in Beck (p. 1411) and Strauss (p. 932, Table II)., 261988=The above polymerization processes can of course be used to make relatively random copolymers (except for certain CO copolymers) of various possible monomers. However, some of them can be used to make block polymers. A block polymer is conventionally defined as a polymer comprising molecules in which there is a linear arrangement of blocks, a block being a portion of a polymer molecule which the monomeric units have at least one constitutional or configurational feature absent from adjacent portions (definition from H. Mark, et al., Ed., Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, Vol. 2, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1985, p. 324). Herein in a block copolymer, the constitutional difference is a difference in monomer units used to make that block, while in a block homopolymer the same monomer(s) are used but the repeat units making up different blocks are different structure and/or ratios of types of structures., 400576=A 100 mL autoclave was charged with Pd(CH3 CN)4 ! (BF4)2 (0.053 g, 0.12 mmol) and chloroform (50 mL). To this was added a solution of (2,6-i-PrPh)2 DABMe2 (0.070 g, 0.17 mmol) dissolved in 10 mL of chloroform under ethylene pressure (2.1 MPa). The pressure was maintained at 2.1 MPa for 3.0 h, during which time the temperature inside the reactor increased from 23 to 52\ufffd C. The ethylene pressure was then vented and the reaction mixture removed from the reactor. The reactor was washed with 3\ufffd50 mL of chloroform, the washings added to the reaction mixture, and volatiles removed from the resultingsolution in vacuo to afford 25.98 g of a viscous oil. 1 H NMR of this material showed it to be branched polyethylene with 103 methyl-ended branches per 1000 methylenes. GPC analysis in trichlorobenzene gave Mm =10,800, Mw =21,200 vs. linear polyethylene., 393506=A suspension of { Np)2 DABMe2 !PdMe(NCMe)}SbF6 - (0.027 g, 0.02 mmol) in 5 mL FC-75 was agitated under 1.4 MPa of ethylene for 3 h; during this time the temperature inside the reactor varied between 25 and 40\ufffd C. Two FC-75 insoluble fractions were isolated from the reaction mixture. One fraction, a non-viscous oil floating on top of the FC-75, was removed by pipette and shown by 1 H NMR to be branched ethylene ologomers for which Mn =150 and with 504 methyle-ended branches per 1000 methylenes. The other fraction was a viscous oil isolated by removing FC-75 by pipette; it was shown by 1 H NMR to be polyethylene for which Mn =650 and with 240 methyl-ended branches per 1000 methylenes., 711133=The complex (2,4,6-MePh)2 DABAn!NiBr2 was weighed into a glass vial in the dry box (0.0093 g, 0.146 mmol). Cyclopentene (10.0 g, 10,000 equivalents/Ni) was added. A solution of i-BuAlCl2 was added while stirring (2.92 ml, 1.0 M in toluene, 200 equivalents/Ni). After stirring for 163 hours, the solution was filtered and the solids were washed several times on the filter with pentene. The polymer was dried in vacuo for 12 hours at room temperature to yield 1.99 g of fine powder (1990 turnovers/Ni). The polymer was pressed at 292\ufffd C. to give a transparent, light gray, tough film. A DSC thermal fractionation experiment was done according to the procedure of Example 312. A DSC was then recorded from 0\ufffd C. to 330\ufffd C. at 10\ufffd C./min. Tg=103\ufffd C., Tm (onset)=150\ufffd C., Tm (end)=290\ufffd C., Heat of fusion=27 J/g., 839974=A portion of the product (43 mg) in toluene (25 mL) in a Schlenk flask was placed under an atmosphere of ethylene (35 kPa gauge) and 0.8 ml PMAO solution (9.6% Al) was added. The solution turned dark purple After 18 hours the reaction was quenched with MeOH/10% HCl which precipitated the polymer. The polymer (0.310 g) was collected by filtration, washed well with MeOH and dried under reduced pressure. Branching (1 H NMR): 72 Methyl per 1000 methylene., 304695=5. Elastic, randomly-branched olefin polymers are disclosed which have very good processability, including processing indices (PI's) less than or equal to 70 percent of those of a comparative linear olefin polymer and a critical shear rate at onset of surface melt fracture of at least 50 percent greater than the critical shear rate at the onset of surface melt fracture of a traditional linear olefin polymer at about the same I2 and Mw/Mn. The novel polymers may have higher low/zero shear viscosity and lower high shear viscosity than comparative linear olefin polymers made by other means. These polymers may be characterized as having: a) a melt flow ratio, I10/I2, \u22675.63, b) a molecular weight distribution, Mw/Mn, defined by the equation: Mw/Mn\u2266(I10/I2)-4.63, and c) a critical shear rate at onset of surface melt fracture of at least 50 percent greater than the critical shear rate at the onset of surface melt fracture of a linear olefin polymer having about the same I2 and Mw/Mn. Some blends of these polymer are characterized as having: a) a melt flow ratio, I10/I2,\u22675.63, b) a molecular weight distribution, Mw/Mn, defined by the equation: Mw/Mn\u2266(I10/I2)-4.63, and c) a critical shear rate at onset of surface melt fracture of at least 50 percent greater than the critical shear rate at the onset of surface melt melt fracture of a linear olefin polymer having about the same I2 and Mw/Mn and (b) at least one other natural or synthetic polymer chosen from the polymer of claims 1, 3, 4, 6, 332, or 343, a conventional high density polyethylen, low density polyethylene or linear low density polyethylene polymer. The polymers may be further characterized as having a melt flow ration, I10/I2,\u22675.63, a molecular weight distribution, Mw/Mn, defined by the equation: Mw/Mn\u2266(I10/I2)-4.63, and a critical shear stress at onset of gross melt fracture of greater than about 400 kPa (4\ufffd106 dyne/cm2) and their method of manufacture are disclosed. The randomly-branched olefin polymers preferably have a molecular weight distribution from about 1.5 to about 2.5. The polymers described herein often have improved processability over conventional olefin polymers and are useful in producing fabricated articles such as fibers, films, and molded parts. For this paragraph, the balue I2 is measured in accordance with ASTM D-1238-190/10; critical shear rate at onset of surface melt fracture and processing index (PI) are defined in U.S. Pat. No. 5,278,272, which is hereby included by reference., 651005=(Note: It is believed that in the following experiment, adventitious oxygen was present and acted as a cocatalyst.) Under nitrogen, (2.6-i-PrPh)2 DABAn!Ni (COD) (0.006 g, 0.009 mmol) and 9.6 wt. % MAO in toluene (0.54 mL, 1.66 mmol) were dissolved in 50 mL of toluene. This mixture was then transferred to a 100 mL autoclave. The autoclave was then charged with 2.1 MPa of ethylene. The reaction mixture was stirred for 8 min. During this time, the temperature inside the reactor varied between 23\ufffd and 51\ufffd C. Ethylene pressure was then vented. The product polymer was washed with methanol and dried, affording 8.44 g of polyethylene. 1 H NMR (CDCl2, 120\ufffd C.) showed that this sample contained 77 methyl-ended branches per 1000 methylenes., 260899=It is preferred that PP's made herein have about 25 to about 300 \u03b4+ methylene groups per 1000 methylene groups (total) in the PP., 896019=A flame-dried 250 mL Schlenk flask was charged with 0.1621 g (1.003\ufffd10-4 mol) of (2,5-t-BuPh)2 DABAn!PdMe(Et2 O)BAF- in the glove box. The flask was twice evacuated and back-filled with ethylene and then cooled to -60\ufffd C. The solid was dissolved in 100 mL of CH2 Cl2 and the flask was allowed to warm to room temperature with stirring under an atmosphere of ethylene. After stirring for 23 h the polymerization was quenched with methanol. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the polymer was dissolved in petroleum ether and filtered through silica gel. The filtrate was concentrated and the remaining solvent was removed under vacuum to give a clear, colorless, viscous liquid. Yield=0.2809 g. 1 H NMR analysis: 136 Me/1000 CH2., 835612=(2,6-iPrPh)2 DABMe2 !CoMe2 (34 mg) in toluene (25 mL) in a Schlenk flask was placed under an atmosphere of ethylene (140 kPa absolute!) and after stirring for 2 hours, 0.6 ml PMAO solution (9.6% Al) was added. The solution remained dark purple and, after several hours at room temperature, became viscous. After 48 hours the reaction was quenched with MeOH/10% HCl which precipitated the polymer. The polymer (0.838 g) was collected by filtration, washed well with MeOH and dried under reduced pressure. Branching (1 H-NMR): 115 methyl per 1000 methylene. DSC: Tg=-45\ufffd C., 447401=A 0.53-g (0.063 mmol) sample of silica gel containing 10 wt % { (2,6-i-PrPh)2 DABMe2 !PDCH2 CH2 C(O)CH3 SbF6 - was placed in a 600-mL Parr\ufffd stirred autoclave under nitrogen. To this was added 40 mL of dry, deaerated hexane. The autoclave was stirred and pressurized to 5.5 MPa with ethylene; the ethylene feed was then turned off. The internal temperature peaked briefly at 31\ufffd C. The reaction was stirred for 14 hr at 23\ufffd C. as the pressure dropped to 5.3 MPa; the ethylene was then vented. The autoclave contained a clear, yellow, gooey rubber swollen with hexane. The product was dissolved in 200 mL chloroform, filtered through glass wool, rotary evaporated, and held under high vacuum to yield 7.95 g (4500 catalyst turnovers) of gummy, rubbery polyethylene. 1 N NMR analysis (CDCl3): 96 methyl carbons per 1000 methylene carbons. Gel permeation chromatography (trichlorobenzene, 135\ufffd C., polystyrene reference, results calculated as polyethylene using universal calibration theory): Mn =6,900; M2 =118,000; M2 /Mn =17.08., 242446=One such preferred dipolymer has about 60 to 100 methyl groups (excluding methyl groups which are esters) per 1000 methylene groups in the polymer, and contains, per 100 methyl branches, about 45 to about 65 ethyl branches, about 1 to about 3 propyl branches, about 3 to about 10 butyl branches, about 1 to about 3 amyl branches, and about 15 to about 25 hexyl or longer branches. In addition, the ester and carboxylic acid containing repeat units are often distributed mostly at the ends of the branches as follows. If the branches, and the carbon atom to which they are attached to the main chain, are of the formula --CH(CH2)n CO2 R1, wherein the CH is part of the main chain, then in some of these polymers about 40 to about 50 mole percent of ester groups are found in branches where n is 5 or more, about 10 to about 20 mole percent when n is 4, about 20 to 30 mole percent when n is 0. When n is 0, an acrylate ester has polymerized \"normally\" as part of the main chain, with the repeat unit --CH2 --CHCO2 R1 --., 237594=These polymers, and others herein, can have unique structures in terms of the branching in the polymer. Branching may be determined by NMR spectroscopy (see the Examples for details), and this analysis can determine the total number of branches, and to some extent the length of the branches. Herein the amount of branching is expressed as the number of branches per 1000 of the total methylene (--CH2 --) groups in the polymer, with one exception. Methylene groups that are in an ester grouping, i.e. --CO2 R, are not counted as part of the 1000 methylenes. These methylene groups include those in the main chain and in the branches. These polymers, which are E homopolymers, have a branch content of about 80 to about 150 branches per 1000 methylene groups, preferably about 100 to about 130 branches per 1000 methylene groups. These branches do not include polymer end groups. In addition the distribution of the sizes (lengths) of the branches is unique. Of the above total branches, for every 100 that are methyl, about 30 to about 90 are ethyl, about 4 to about 20 are propyl, about 15 to about 50 butyl, about 3 to about 15 are amyl, and about 30 to about 140 are hexyl or longer, and it is preferred that for every 100 that are methyl, about 50 to about 75 are ethyl, about 5 to about 15 are propyl, about 24 to about 40 are butyl, about 5 to 10 are amyl, and about 65 to about 120 are hexyl or larger. These E homopolymers are often amorphous, although in some there may be a small amount of crystallinity., 902266=In a nitrogen-filled drybox, 25 mL of Et2 O was added to a flask containing (2,6-i-PrPh)2 DABMe2 !PdMeCl (402 mg, 0.716 mmol) and NaBAF (633 mg, 0.714 mmol) to yield at orange solution. Styrene (110 \u03bcL, 0.960 mmol, 1.35 equiv) was dissolved in \u02dc10 mL of Et2 O and the resulting solution was added to the reaction mixture, which was then stirred for 3 h. Next, the solution was filtered and the solvent was removed in vacuo: The resulting orange powder (0.93 g, 87%) was washed with hexane and dried in vacuo. 1 H NMR (CD2 Cl2, 300 MHz, rt) \u03b4 7.76 (s, 8, BAF: Ho), 7.59 (s, 4, BAF: Hp), 7.46-7.17 (m, 9, Haryl), 6.29 (d, 1, J=7.33, Haryl), 5.65 (d, 1, J=6.59, Haryl), 3.33, 3.13, 2.37 and 1.93 (septet, 1 each, J=6.97-6.72, CHMe2,C'HMe2, C\"HMe2, C'\"HMe2), 3.17 (dd, 1, J=11.36, 3.66, (CHEtPh), 2.22 and 2.17 (s, 3 each, N\u2550C(Me)--C'(Me)\u2550N), 1.52, 1.45, 1.26, 1.26, 1.19, 1.15, 0.94 and 0.73 (d, 3 each, J=6.97-6.59, CHMeMe', C'HMeMe', C\"HMeMe', C'\"HMeMe'), 0.88 (t, 3, J=0.88, CH(CH2 CH3)Ph), 1.13 and -0.06 (m, 1 each, CH(CHH'CH3)Ph); 13 C NMR (CD2 Cl2, 75 MHz, rt) \u03b4 176.6 and 174.0 (N\u2550C--C'\u2550N), 162.2 (q, JCB =49.3, BAF: Cipso), 142.8 and 142.4 (Ar, Ar': Cipso), 138.2, 137.3, 137.1, and 136.9 (Ar, Ar': Co), 135.2 (BAF: Co, Co '), 134.6 and 132.2 (Ph: Co, Cm, or Cp)), 129.4 (BAF: Cm), 129.0 and 128.5 (Ar, Ar': Cp), 125.1, 125.1, 124.9 and 124.7 (Ar, Ar': Cm), 125.1 (q, JCF =272.5, BAF: CF3), 120.2 (Ph: Cipso) and 120.0 (Ph: Co, Cm, or Cp), 117.9 (BAF: Cp), 103.0 and 88.6 (Ph: Co ' and Cm '), 69.1(CHEtPh), 29.9, 29.7, 29.12 and 29.09 (CHMe2, C'HMe2, C\"HMe2, C'\"HMe2), 24.4, 24.3, 23.5, 23.4, 23.1, 23.0, 22.9, and 22.7 (CHMeMe', C'HMeMe', C\"HMeMe', C'\"HMeMe'), 20.8, 20.65, and 20.61 (N\u2550C(Me)--C'(Me)\u2550N, CH(CH2 CH3)Ph)), 13.1 (CH(CH2 CH3)Ph)., 837822=(2,6-iPrPh)2 DABMe2 !CoMe2 (15 mg) was dissolved in benzene (10 ml in a shaker tube) and the solution frozen. Tris(pentaflorophenyl)boron (25 ml) dissolved in benzene (10 ml) was added on top of the frozen layer and frozen as well. The solution was thawed under an ethylene atmosphere (6.9 MPa) and shaken at that pressure for 18 hours.

The infrared spectrum showed strong COOH absorbances at 3400-2500 and at 1705 cm-1, as well as strong methylene absorbances at 3000-2900 and 1470 cm-1., 644075=This example demonstrates copolymerization of ethylene and 1-octene to give polymer with mostly C6+ branches. Under nitrogen, (2,6-i-PrPh)2 DABH2 !NiBr2 (0.005 g, 0.0084 mmol) and 9.6 wt. % MAO in toluene (0.50 mL) were dissolved in 10 mL of toluene at room temperature. The resulting solution was immediately transferred to a 100 mL autoclave that had previously been flushed with nitrogen and evacuated. 1-Octene (40 mL, 255 mmol) was then added to the reactor, which was subsequently charged with ethylene (320 kPa). The reaction mixture was stirred for 60 min, during which time the temperature inside the reactor varied between 24\ufffd and 28\ufffd C. Ethylene was then vented, and the product polymer was precipitated by addition of the crude reaction mixture to 50 mL of methanol containing 5 mL of concentrated aqueous HCl. The polymer precipitated as a slightly viscous oil; this was removed by pipette and dried affording 3.03 g of amorphous ethylene/1-octene copolymer. Branching per 1000 CH2 was quantified by 13 C NMR (C6 D3 Cl3, 25\ufffd C.): total Methyls (83.6), Methyl (4), Ethyl (1.6), Propyl (4.4), Butyl (5.6), Amyl (10.1), \u2267Hex and end of chains (65.8), \u2267Am and end of chains (69.3), \u2267Bu and end of chains (73.7). GPC (trichlorobenzene vs. linear polyethylene): Mw =48,200, Mn =17,000. DSC: Tg=-63\ufffd C., 140762=Described herein is a homopolypropylene with a glass transition temperature of -30\ufffd C. or less, and containing at least about 50 branches per 1000 methylene groups., 420836=Following the procedure of Example 84 { (2,6-i-PrPh)DABMe2 !PdMe(OEt2)}BAF- (164 mg, 0.122 mmol) catalyzed the polymerization of ethylene for 24 h in 50 mL of CH2 Cl2 to give 30.16 g of polymer as a viscous oil. 1 H NMR (C6 D6) \u03b4 1.41 (CH2, CH), 0.94 (CH3); Branching: \u02dc115 CH3 per 1000 CH2 ; GPC Analysis (THF, PMMA standards, RI Detector): Mw =262,000; Mw =121,000; PDI=2.2; DSC: Tg =-66.8\ufffd C., 556667=The solid complex { (2,6-i-PrPh(2 DABMe2 !PdCH2 CH2 CH2 C(O)OCH3 }SbF6 - (0.084 g, 0.10 mmol) was added to a stirring solution of 10.0 ml cyclopentene in 10 ml CHCl3 in a Schlenk flask. The flask was evacuated briefly and refilled with ethylene. It was maintained under slightly above 1 atm ethylene pressure using a mercury bubbler. After 20 h, the solvent and unreacted monomers were removed in vacuo from the homogeneous solution to give 12.89 g of highly viscous fluid. 1 H-- NMR (CDCl3): cyclopentene peaks: 0.65(m, 1H); 1.15(broad s, 2H); 1.5-2.0(m, 5H); ethylene peaks: 0.75-0.95(m, CH3); 0.95-1.5(m, CH and CH2). Integration shows 24 mole % cyclopentene in this copolymer. Analysis of the polyethylene part of the spectrum (omitting peaks due to cyclopentyl units) shows 75 total methyl carbons per 1000 methylene carbons. Based on quantitative 13 C analysis, the distribution of branches per 1000 methylene carbons is Methyl (21), Ethyl (13), Propyl (\u02dc0), Butyl (20) and \u2273Amyl (20). DSC (first heat: 25 to 150\ufffd C., 10\ufffd C./min; first cool: 150 to -150\ufffd C., 10\ufffd C./min: second heat: -150 to 150\ufffd C., 10\ufffd C./min,; values of second heat reported): Tg=-33\ufffd C., Tm=19\ufffd C. (11 J/g). GPC (trichlorobenzene, 135\ufffd C., polystyrene reference, results calculated as linear polyethylene using universal calibration theory): Mn =3,960 Mw =10,800 Mw /Mn =2.73., 735882=One equivalent of MA was added to an NMR tube containing a 0.0198 M solution of { (2,6-iPrPh)2 DABH2 !PdMe(OEt2)!}BAF in CD2 Cl2 (700 \u03bcL) at -78\ufffd C., and the tube was transferred to the precooled NMR probe. After 14.25 min at -80\ufffd C., approximately 80% of the ether adduct had been converted to the olefin complex. Two sets of bound olefin resonances were observed in a 86:14 ratio. This observation is consistent with the existence of two different rotamers of the olefin complex. Insertion of MA into the Pd--Me bond occurred with predominantly 2,1 regiochemistry to give the 4-membered chelate 4a(Me) at -80\ufffd C. (t1/2 \u02dc2.0 h). The resonances for the major rotamer of the olefin complex disappeared before those of the minor rotamer. Much slower conversion of 4a(Me) to the 5-membered chelate 5a(Me) also began at -80\ufffd C. Upon warming to -60\ufffd C., complete and selective formation of 5a(Me) occurred in less than 4 h. The 5-membered chelate was relatively stable at temperatures below -502 C., however, upon warming to -20\ufffd C., rearrangement to the 6-membered chelate 6a(Me) was observed. NMR spectral data for the olefin complex, 4a(Me), and 5a(Me) follow. Spectral data for 6a(Me) is identical to that of the isolated chelate complex (see Examples 328-335)., 142122=This invention concerns a copolymer of cyclopentene and ethylene wherein there are at least 20 branches per 1000 methylene carbon atoms., 497968=Ethylene and methyl acrylate (20 ml) were copolymerized in 20 ml of CHCl3 according to example 125 using catalyst { (2,6-i-PrPh)2 DABMe2 !Pd CH2 CH2 CH2 C(O)OCH3 }SbF6 - (0.339 g, 0.40 mmol) to give 2.17 g of copolymer after a reaction time of 72 hours. 13 C NMR quantitative analysis: Mole %: ethylene (76.3), methyl acrylate (23.7).

When R2 and R5 were 4-MePh (this example) atactic alternating copolymer was isolated. When R2 and R5 were 2,6-i-PrPh (Example 229) predominantly syndiotactic alternating copolymer was isolated.
