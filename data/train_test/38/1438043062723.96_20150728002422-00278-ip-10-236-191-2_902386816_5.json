            "Professional golfing overachievers. Also anyone who is friendly, loves beautiful campuses, enjoys good weather, and is willing to learn!",
            "Besides becoming a professional golf player? Stack up on the APs and honors courses. Furman has great professors and good research opportunities. The sooner you learn to study and manage your time, the better you'll be off.",
            "Furman University is very expensive. Tuition is a little over 39,000 without room and board! I definitely recommend applying for scholarships...and maybe becoming a professional golfer.",
            "The atmosphere is great. With a beautiful campus, great weather, and charming people, Furman seems like a place you would want to call home.",
            "Professors seem really outgoing, intelligent, and ready to teach. The good thing about Furman: it's small enough so that the professors really get to know you."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{14018=The campus is quiet large, covering almost 800 acres. Although it is located near downtown and is only 30 minutes away from my home, I feel as though I am miles away and in an isolated location. The social atmosphere here is great. Everyone is extremely nice and it is easy to make many friends. The size is just right, with just about 2600 students. I highly recommend FURMAN!, 8962=Furman University has a very active campus life. The Furman University Student Activities Board plans countless events throughout the year that appeal to all different sorts of people. They've sponsored everything from an aquarium sleepover at the Tennessee Aquarium to Christmas at the Biltmore Estate. Furman also hosts its share of notable guest speakers and artists. In April we had the Far East Movement and Matt & Kim perform. We even had Seth Myers from SNL's Weekend Update come and give a show. The Greek life at Furman University is very active but not exclusive. Many Greek events are open to all Furman students. If you are interested in life off campus, Downtown Greenville is 15 minutes away with an array of shops and Falls Park that centers around the famous Liberty Bridge, a suspension bridge that curves gracefully over the Reedy River Falls. Furman University is also right next to the Swamp Rabbit Trail, a multi-use paved trail that runs all the way from the town of Travelers Rest to Downtown Greenville., 45611=It is a private school, and so is extremely expensive. However, the price of the school is reflected in the quality of the campus and faculty. Still, a little pricey, especially for a school that does not give out many scholarships (especially when it is only 2500 students)., 39979=There are 6 fraternities on campus and 6 sororities. Furman will be adding a new sorority in 2015 as well. 50% of students on campus are in fraternities. 60% girls, 40% guys. Greek life is starting to go down hill. Unfortunately, Jason Cassidy is trying to ruin greek life on campus. New rules and restrictions prevent fraternities from basically having parties in general. Jason Cassidy is out to get greeks and he won't quit until we're all off campus. If you want to join a fraternity, save yourself and don't come here., 116013=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 448=Furman is best for students who like the smaller school (Furman has roughly 2800 students).}",

Check out the downtown scene - get out of the Furman bubble once in a while. Smiling or even waving will get you a lot further than you may think. Get to know your professors. Get involved! Bang for the buck Furman is really expensive. That's why you should start applying for scholarships - now! Am enjoying being here One of the main reasons that I chose to attend Furman is the people: they are welcoming, friendly, smart, and they all seem to have that Southern hospitality thing down pat! Am learning a lot",
