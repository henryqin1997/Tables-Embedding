For the reasons which have been previously delineated above, this arrangement is undesirable., 30131=That is, as shown best by line 38 of graph 30, the noise which is produced by the alternator as it operates within an operating range of about 1200 to about 1580 revolutions per minute is greatly reduced from the noise which is produced in this alternator operating range by use of the bracket 16 which is made in accordance with the prior art. Particularly, as shown in FIG. 4, the noise amplitude 42 which is produced by alternator 18 when mounted to engine 14 by bracket 16 is substantially equal to about 60 decibels at an alternator operating speed of about 1550 revolutions per minute, which substantially represents an engine idling condition. However, when alternator 18 is mounted to engine 14 by bracket 50, the noise amplitude level 44 is reduced by about fifteen decibels to a substantially imperceptible level (i.e., substantially imperceptible to a vehicle occupant's ear) of about 45 decibels at the same operating speed of about 1550 revolutions per minute. As further shown in FIG. 4, the level of alternator noise 44, which is produced when using bracket 50, is about equal to the level produced by the alternator 18 without the use of any alternator mounting bracket, at an alternator operating speed of about 1550 revolutions per minute., 20597=The amplitude of the lateral vibration varies in accordance with the operating speed of the alternator. Importantly, the lateral vibration amplitude typically attains a relatively large and significant value at an alternator operating speed which corresponds to about 1550 revolutions per minute and which typically occurs as the engine enters or occupies an idle state. Since the vehicle is substantially stationary during such an engine idle state, thereby reducing and/or eliminating the need for the driver to be focused upon the task of driving or maneuvering the vehicle and reducing the noise which is generated by the engine, tires, and airflow, the undesired \u201cwhine\u201d is readily noticed or perceived by the driver and/or passengers of the vehicle.}",
