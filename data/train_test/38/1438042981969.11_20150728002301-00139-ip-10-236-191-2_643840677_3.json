In the 20 plus years that Past Reflections has been busy serving living historians and Civil War Re-enactors, we have also had musuem and theatrical clients. We have a passion for making exact reproductions of extant garments. Many museums have hired us for this expertise. Recreating as perfectly as current materials will allow gives the organization a way to present the history of the original garment to the visiting public while preserving the original by not keeping it on display. Reproductions are made by carefully making a pattern from the original and using the correct, period sewing processes to construct an exact copy. Below is a parital list of museums and organizations that we have built reproductions for. At the bottom of the list, also note several movie and theater companies that we have provided costumes for. The links below take you to images of the work we've done for the organizations. \u00a0 \u00a0 Links Presentations Photo Gallery Events Meet the Owners",
