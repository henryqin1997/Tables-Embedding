UCS Network Configuration IMPORTANT: For instructions on performing the network configuration needed to deploy Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise (UCCE) on UCS servers, see UCS Network Configuration for UCCE. QoS should be enabled for the Router and PG configuration. For more information on QoS consideration, refer to Chapter 12, \u00a0Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise Solution Reference Network Design (SRND). For information on best practices for Cisco VLAN trunking to VMware, refer to this website. Support for UCM Clustering Over the WAN with UCCE on UCS Hardware You can deploy the Unified Communications Manager (UCM) Clustering Over the WAN deployment model with Unified CCE on UCS hardware. When you implement this deployment model, be sure to follow the best practices outlined in the section \"IPT: Clustering Over the WAN\" in the Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise Solution Reference Network Design (SRND).
