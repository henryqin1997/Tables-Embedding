            "Campus Safety is pretty good, because there is campus security who are available to drive students to places when they are out late etc. Also, when incidents do occur, emails are sent to the students to warn them of what has happened.",
            "There are many clubs and activities, since it is a big school.",
            "There are clubs and different outings put on by the school, as well as athletic events to do for fun.",
            "The campus center has some pretty good choices and selections for food, but the cafeteria rotates the schedule of food and most of the time it isn't really good. Many nights I just eat grilled cheese, because it's the only appealing thing.",
            "Dorm life is very good. I enjoy dorming, because it is freedom away from home. Yet, many people like to party and can be quite inconsiderate to others. That's why I suggest choosing a dorm that is right for you.",
            "Certain classes are very challenging, while others are easier to get by without much work. If one takes the right classes to satisfy requirements for General Education and their education, then the classes will be both fun and challenging.",
            "I suggest looking up different prices for books or waiting until the first day of class to see whether or not the professor actually requires the book, because books are expensive.",
            "The University of Hawaii at Manoa is an ideal school for many of the students who attend. Many students come here because it is in Hawaii, and they've always wanted to experience paradise. Overall, it is a good school with many majors to choose from and opportunities to experience."

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Its a great place for students who is alright with having to travel on an airplane in order to get to college if you are from the mainland and you must get used to not being able to drive for long periods of time because you are on an island. Also you must enjoy the sunshine and warm weather year-round. This is also a great place for students who wants to learn many different languages because UH offers many different foreign languages that you probably wouldnt be able to learn at a college on the mainland. Tips for prospective students Be ready for a different demographic of students with many students of Asian and Pacific Islander decent. Some of the classes can be difficult and some of the professors can be hard to understand because of accents, but if you have tutors or form study groups with other students in the class, then you will be ok. Am enjoying being here The people in Hawaii are very friendly. Many of the professors are really helpful and want you to succeed in their classroom. Obviously, being in Hawaii year-round is going to a great place to spend your time and there is much to be explored here. Am learning a lot",
