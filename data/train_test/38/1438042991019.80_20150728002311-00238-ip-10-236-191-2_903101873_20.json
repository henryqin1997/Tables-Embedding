Clark EMS, if there is an emergency, trained students come to the rescue! I feel very safe on campus, you just have to be smart about where and when you go somewhere.",
            "There is no Greek Life which is great :)",
            "There are so many clubs I don't even know what to say!",
            "Open-Minded and waiting to Change the World for the better!",
            "Spree Day: A day when the faculty decides to cancel all classes. Happens sometime in the spring in which great fun in had by all!",
            "Clark is pricey just like all universities these days. But, they do give very good financial aid packages to those who earn them. Pricey but not unreachable.",
            "There are different events every week sent to the e-mails such as intramural sports, movie showings, game nights, and sports events. Let's just say you'll never be bored!",
            "The food is alright, you definitely won't go hungry here and they have a lot of choices to eat. The Higgins Dining Room in the UC, Jazzman's in the Academic Commons, and The Bistro in the UC have many things to choose from even though things might not always be cooked they way you would like them to.",
            "Dorm life is great! The rooms were large enough for me and my roommate to live in comfortably. Also I met most of my friends in the lounge area just hanging out and having fun!",
            "You definitely have to work very hard for your grades here, as it should be. The professors are willing to help and guide you but you need to take the initiative on your learning or else you will move nowhere.",
            "I think that the college essay has a lot to do with being accepted at Clark. My advice for whoever is reading this is to lay it all on the line, tell the school how you feel, what difference you want to make in the world, who you want to be like, and how you are going to do it.",
            "When I was younger I never dreamed that I would be attending a university with professors that push their students as far as they can go, and then farther than that. Clark is a place where students have to have an open mind and heart and who want to make a difference in the world. At school our motto is Challenge Convention, Change our World if you feel up to the task, take a closer look!"

With special programs such as the International Studies Streams, students cannot help but find themselves with a truly innovative sense of globalization and the way each person has the potential to interact with the world. Additionally, Clark is very involved with the community its surrounded by.",
