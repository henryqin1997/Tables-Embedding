    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{62063=Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been recognized as a powerful method for short-term load forecasting (STLF) of power systems. However, traditional ANNs are mostly trained by gradient-based learning algorithms which usually suffer from excessive training and tuning burden as well as unsatisfactory generalization performance. Based on the ensemble learning strategy, this paper develops an ensemble model of a promising novel learning technology called extreme learning machine (ELM) for high-quality STLF of Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). The model consists of a series of single ELMs. During the training, the ensemble model generalizes the randomness of single ELMs by selecting not only random input parameters but also random hidden nodes within a pre-defined range. The forecast result is taken as the median value the single ELM outputs. Owing to the very fast training/tuning speed of ELM, the model can be efficiently updated to on-line track the variation trend of the electricity load and maintain the accuracy. The developed model is tested with the NEM historical load data and its performance is compared with some state-of-the-art learning algorithms. The results show that the training efficiency and the forecasting accuracy of the developed model are superior over the competitive algorithms.\u00c2\u00a9The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013., 41736=Corrective security-constrained optimal power flow (CSCOPF) considers the use of corrective control to remove system security violations in the post-contingency state. Its optimality not only depends on the pre-contingency state, but also the post-contingency state as well as the involved corrective control actions. This study first gives a comprehensive review on the relevant OPF models and then proposes a hybrid method to solve the CSCOPF problem. It makes use of the evolutionary algorithms to randomly search the maximum feasible region and state-of-the-art OPF solution technique (interior-point method) to provide deterministic solutions in the found region. The two interact iteratively to progressively approach the final solution. The proposed method is verified on the IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus systems. Comparison studies show that (i) CSCOPF can better balance the security and economy and (ii) the hybrid method is overall superior (in solution quality, robustness and convergence characteristic) over the single evolutionary algorithm. Parallel processing is applied to speed-up the computations. \u00c2\u00a9 The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014., 44251=Distributed generation (DG) is rapidly increasing its penetration level worldwide and is expected to play a more important role in providing power. An important benefit of DG is its ability to defer transmission investments. In this paper, a simulation model is implemented to conduct quantitative analysis on the effect of DG on transmission investment deferral. The transmission expansion model is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem with comprehensive technical constraints, such as AC power flow and system reliability and/or security. The case study that was selected is the Queensland electricity market in Australia. Simulation results show that DG can reduce transmission investments significantly. This ability however is greatly influenced by a number of factors, such as the location of DG, the network topology, and power system technical constraints. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 IEEE., 30257=An elaborately designed integrated power distribution and electric vehicle (EV) charging system will not only reduce the investment and operation cost of the system concerned, but also promote the popularization of environmentally friendly EVs. In this context, a multi-objective collaborative planning strategy is presented to deal with the optimal planning issue in integrated power distribution and EV charging systems. In the developed model, the overall annual cost of investment and energy losses is minimized simultaneously with the maximization of the annual traffic flow captured by fast charging stations (FCSs). Additionally, the user equilibrium based traffic assignment model (UETAM) is integrated to address the maximal traffic flow capturing problem. Subsequently, a decomposition based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA/D) is employed to seek the non-dominated solutions, i.e., the Pareto frontier. Finally, collaborative planning results of two coupled distribution and transportation systems are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed model and solution method. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 IEEE., 38980=Event-driven load shedding is an effective countermeasure against voltage collapse in power systems. Conventionally, its optimisation relies on sensitivity-based linear methods, which, however, could suffer from unrealistic assumptions and suboptimality. In this study, an alternative approach based on parallel-differential evolution (P-DE) is proposed for efficiently and globally optimising the event-driven load shedding against voltage collapse. Working in a parallel structure, the approach consists of candidate buses selection, voltage stability assessment (VSA) and DE optimisation. Compared with conventional methods, it fully considers the non-linearity of the problem and is able to effectively escape from local optima and not limited to system modelling and unrealistic assumptions. Besides, any type of objective functions and VSA techniques can be used. The proposed approach has been tested on the IEEE 118-bus test system considering two cases for preventive control and corrective control, respectively, and compared with the two existing methods. Simulation results have verified its effectiveness and superiority over the compared methods. \u00c2\u00a9 The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014., 27574=Accurate and reliable forecast of wind power is essential to power system operation and control. However, due to the nonstationarity of wind power series, traditional point forecasting can hardly be accurate, leading to increased uncertainties and risks for system operation. This paper proposes an extreme learning machine (ELM)-based probabilistic forecasting method for wind power generation. To account for the uncertainties in the forecasting results, several bootstrap methods have been compared for modeling the regression uncertainty, based on which the pairs bootstrap method is identified with the best performance. Consequently, a new method for prediction intervals formulation based on the ELM and the pairs bootstrap is developed. Wind power forecasting has been conducted in different seasons using the proposed approach with the historical wind power time series as the inputs alone. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for probabilistic forecasting of wind power generation with a high potential for practical applications in power systems. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 IEEE., 18679=Fault diagnosis is an important task in power system analysis. In this paper, a hybrid method is proposed to perform online fault diagnosis of transmission lines. Stochastic time domain simulation (STDS) is firstly introduced to generate simulated fault and system data so as to improve the computational speed of fault diagnosis and handle the possible malfunction of protective relays and circuit breakers. The fault diagnosis problem is then formulated as an optimization problem, which can take into account the possible malfunction of protection devices and post-fault system trajectories. We propose a novel optimization algorithm, namely history driven differential evolution (HDDE) to solve the formulated optimization problem. The proposed methodology is finally tested using comprehensive case studies to demonstrate its effectiveness. \u00c2\u00a9 2014., 51422=Deploying shunt capacitor banks in distribution systems can effectively reduce the power loss and provide additional benefits for system operation. In practice, the power loss on distribution transformers can account for a considerable portion of the overall loss. This paper proposes a method for optimal placement of capacitor banks to the distribution transformers to reduce power loss. The capacitor bank locations are considered at the low-side of transformers. The net present value (NPV) criterion is adopted to evaluate the cost benefit of the capacitor installation project. First, an explicit formula for directly calculating the power loss of radial distribution systems is derived. Then, the optimal capacitor bank placement is formulated as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model maximizing the NPV of the project subject to certain constraints. The model is suitable for being solved by commercial MIP packages, and the operational control of the capacitor banks to maximize the power loss reduction can be simply achieved by local automatic switching according to VAR measurements. The proposed method has been practically applied in the Macau distribution system, and the simulation results show that the proposed method is computationally efficient, and a considerable positive NPV can be obtained from the optimal capacitor bank placement. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 IEEE., 288359=Copyright 2015 CRICOS Provider Number 00109J The University of Newcastle, Australia}",
