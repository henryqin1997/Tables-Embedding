Delayed Firebug Load Firebug UI & Logic is mostly running inside an iframe (chrome://firebug/content/firebugFrame.xul). The goal here is to load the content of the iframe on demand at soon as the user needs Firebug the first time. However there are some pieces that are running within the global Firefox UI (browser.xul) and must be loaded immediately after the browser window is loaded. Page context menu (inspector, open with editor) Firebug global menu (tool, view, web developer, ...) Firebug start button (Firefox toolbar) Firebug iframe and a splitter Firebug iframe content should be automatically loaded when the user presses F12 or uses any command available through an existing menu or a keyboard shortcut. Such functionality requires all global parts to be clearly separated and independent for the Firebug UI itself (the one running in the iframe). Tasks: Separate Firebug UI from Global UI (create separate directory for global parts) Create a command dispatcher for global commands that loads Firebug if necessary. Initialize",
