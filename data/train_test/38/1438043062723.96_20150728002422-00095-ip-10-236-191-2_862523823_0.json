This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1986 it has nearly tripled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +26% per year. These returns cover a period from 1986-2011 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly, an independent accounting firm., 14845=by Zacks Equity Research \u00a0\u00a0Published on June 07, 2012 |, 20014=UCB (UCBJF - Snapshot Report) recently presented positive data on Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) from a late-stage trial (RAPID-PsA), conducted in patients suffering from psoriatic arthritis.

UCB has filed the drug with the Japanese regulatory authority. The companies are seeking approval of Cimzia for the treatment of RA in patients who have responded insufficiently to current therapies., 22967=UCB anticipates 2012 results to be driven by the continued sales growth of Cimzia, Vimpat and Neupro.
