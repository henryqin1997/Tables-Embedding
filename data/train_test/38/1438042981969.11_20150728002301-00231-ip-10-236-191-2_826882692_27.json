Kelli B. | 05/26/2015 Read Full Review Wonderful stay! I stayed here with my daughter and her friend in May 2015. The townhome is exactly as described. It is very spacious and extremely clean. We were pleased with the quiet location. We parked our car across the street from the beach and walked a short way to the beach access. The ResortQuest staff was very friendly and helpful! Thank you so much",
