A redemption of a shareholder\u0092s Fund Shares is normally treated as a sale for tax purposes. Fund Shares held for a period of one year or less at the time of such sale or redemption will, for tax purposes, generally result in short-term capital gains or losses and those held for more than one year will generally result in long-term capital gains or losses. Under current law, the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains available to non-corporate shareholders generally is 15%.

Under this method, a portfolio instrument is initially valued at cost, and thereafter a constant accretion/amortization to maturity of any discount or premium is assumed. The effect of changes in the market value of a security as a result of fluctuating interest rates is not taken into account. The Funds utilize the amortized cost valuation method in accordance with Rule 2a\u00967 under the 1940 Act. The money market instruments are valued at \u0093amortized cost\u0094 unless the Board determines that amortized cost does not represent fair value. While amortized cost provides certainty in valuation, it may result in periods when the value of an instrument is higher or lower than the price a Fund would receive if it sold the instrument., 762599=Dechert LLP, 200 Clarendon Street, 27th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02116, serves as counsel to the Trust.

Further, under the authorized participant agreement, Authorized Participants will neither deliver portfolio securities to a Fund, nor be able to receive Fund Securities that are \u0093restricted securities\u0094 as such term is used in Rule 144(a)(3)(i) promulgated under the 1933 Act., 409154=Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point during the life of a Fund a \u0093distribution,\u0094 as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters and subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act.

Put another way, an investment company may borrow, in the aggregate, from banks and others, amounts up to one-third (33 1/3%) of its total assets (including those assets represented by the borrowing). Accordingly, if a Fund were required to pledge assets to secure a borrowing, it would pledge no more than one-third (33 1/3%) of its assets., 385911=If you are an individual investor, a portion of the dividends you receive from a Fund may be treated as \u0093qualified dividend income\u0094 which is taxable to individuals at the same rates that are applicable to long term capital gains. A Fund distribution is treated as qualified dividend income to the extent that the Fund receives dividend income from taxable domestic corporations and certain qualified foreign corporations, provided that certain holding period and other requirements are met. Fund distributions generally will not qualify as qualified dividend income to the extent attributable to interest, capital gains, and, in many cases, distributions from non-U.S. corporations. In the absence of further legislation, for taxable years beginning after December\u00a031, 2012, the special rates for qualified dividend income will no longer apply, and such income will be taxed at ordinary income rates., 571206=Each Fund pays an advisory fee directly to RIMCo, billed monthly on a pro rata basis and calculated as a specified percentage of the average daily net assets of each Fund. (See the Prospectus for Funds\u0092 annual advisory percentage rates.) No shares of the Funds were issued during the fiscal years ended XXXXX, 2011, 2010 and 2009., 449=811-22320, 749571=The Funds intend to distribute annually to their shareholders substantially all of its investment company taxable income, all of its net tax-exempt income and any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers). The Funds will report to shareholders annually the amounts of dividends received from ordinary income, the amount of distributions received from capital gains and the portion of dividends which may qualify for the dividends received deduction, if any. A portion of the dividends received from a Fund may be treated as qualified dividend income (eligible for the reduced maximum rate to individuals of 15% (lower rates apply to individuals in lower tax brackets) to the extent that the Fund receives qualified dividend income. Qualified dividend income includes, in general, subject to certain holding period requirements and other requirements, dividend income from certain U.S. and foreign corporations. Eligible foreign corporations include those incorporated in possessions of the United States, those incorporated in certain countries with comprehensive tax treaties with the United States and those whose stock is tradable on an established securities market in the United States. A dividend will not be treated as qualified dividend income to the extent that (i)\u00a0the shareholder has not held the shares of the Fund on which the dividend was paid for more than 60 days during the 121-day period that begins on the date that is 60 days before the date on which the shares of the Fund become ex-dividend with respect to such dividend (and the Fund also satisfies those holding period requirements with respect to the securities it holds that paid the dividends distributed to the shareholder), (ii)\u00a0the shareholder is under an obligation (whether pursuant to a short sale or otherwise) to make related payments with respect to substantially similar or related property, or (iii)\u00a0the shareholder elects to treat such dividend as investment income under section 163(d)(4)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. A Fund may derive capital gains and losses in connection with the sale or other disposition of its portfolio securities. Distributions from net short-term capital gains will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income. Distributions from net long-term gains will be taxable to you at long-term capital gains rates, regardless of how long you have held your Shares in a Fund. Long-term capital gains are currently taxed at a maximum rate of 15%. Absent further legislation, the maximum 15% rate on long-term capital gains will increase to 20% and will cease to apply to qualified dividend income for taxable years beginning after December\u00a031, 2012., 410008=Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not \u0093underwriters\u0094 but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an \u0093unsold allotment\u0094 within the meaning of Section\u00a04(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section\u00a04(3) of the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is available only with respect to transactions on a national securities exchange., 440087=XXXXXX, 2011, 553778=OWNERSHIP OF SHARES. The following table shows the dollar amount ranges of each Trustee\u0092s \u0093beneficial ownership\u0094 of shares of the Funds and all registered funds in the same family of investment companies, including all other series of the Trust as of the end of the most recently completely calendar year. Dollar amount ranges disclosed are established by the SEC. \u0093Beneficial ownership\u0094 is determined in accordance with Rule 16a-1(a)(2) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u00931934 Act\u0094). The Trustees and officers of the Trust own less than 1% of the outstanding shares of the Trust., 378219=Income in the form of dividend distributions, if any, are generally distributed to shareholders monthly, but may vary significantly from period to period. Net capital gains, if any, are distributed at least annually. The Funds may make distributions on a more frequent basis for a Fund to comply with the distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, in all events in a manner consistent with the provisions of the 1940 Act., 873563=Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, this Registration Statement has been signed below by the following persons in the capacities indicated on October 20, 2011., 398699=The Funds value portfolio securities according to Board-approved securities valuation procedures and pricing services, which include market value procedures, fair value procedures and a description of the pricing services used by the Funds. Under the Board-approved securities valuation procedures, the Board has delegated the day-to-day valuation functions to Russell Fund Services Company. However, the Board retains oversight over the valuation process. Investments in other mutual funds are valued at their NAV per share, calculated at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time or as of the close of the NYSE, whichever is earlier. The circumstances under which these companies will use fair value pricing and the effects of using fair value pricing can be found in the other mutual funds\u0092 prospectuses., 871300=The Registrant has duly caused this Post-Effective Amendment No.\u00a024 to its Registration Statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereto duly authorized, in the City of Seattle, and State of Washington, on this 20 day of October, 2011., 629741=With respect to in-kind redemptions of a Fund, the calculation of the value of the Fund Securities and the Cash Redemption Amount to be delivered upon redemption will be made by the Custodian according to the procedures set forth under \u0093Determination of Net Asset Value\u0094, computed on the Business Day on which a redemption order is deemed received by the Trust. Therefore, if a redemption order in proper form is submitted to the Principal Underwriter by a DTC Participant by the specified time on the Order Placement Date, and the requisite number of Shares of the Fund are delivered to the Custodian prior to 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (as set forth on the applicable order form) on the Settlement Date, then the value of the Fund Securities and the Cash Redemption Amount to be delivered will be determined by the Custodian on such Order Placement Date. If the requisite number of Shares of the Fund are not delivered by 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (as set forth on the applicable order form) on the Settlement Date, the Fund will not release the underlying securities for delivery unless collateral is posted in such percentage amount of missing Shares as set forth in the Participant Agreement (marked to market daily)., 426918=DISTRIBUTION PLAN. Each Fund has adopted a Distribution Plan in accordance with Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act pursuant to which payments of up to 0.25% of the Fund\u0092s average daily net assets may be made for the sale and distribution of its Shares. No payments pursuant to the Distribution Plan will be made through at least XXXX, 2012. Additionally, the implementation of any such payments would have to be approved by the Board prior to implementation. Because these fees would be paid out of each Fund\u0092s assets on an on-going basis, if payments are made in the future, these fees will increase the cost of your investment and may cost you more than paying other types of sales charges., 685785=There is no limit on the percentage of total assets a Fund may pledge. A Fund, however, will only pledge assets as consistent with Section\u00a018 of the 1940 Act. Accordingly, based on SEC staff interpretation, a Fund will only pledge up to one-third of its total assets., 572075=RFSC is paid an administrative fee, billed monthly on a pro rata basis and calculated as a specified percentage of the average daily net assets of each of the Funds.

The Trustees will provide the assistance required by the 1940 Act in connection with any special meeting called by shareholders following a failure of the Board to honor a shareholder request for a special meeting. Each Share of a Fund has one vote in Trustee elections and other matters submitted for shareholder vote. On any matter which affects only a particular Fund only Shares of that Fund are entitled to vote. There are no cumulative voting rights., 529567=COMPENSATION OF TRUSTEES AND OFFICERS.
