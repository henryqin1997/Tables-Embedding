    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6634=Nanoparticles have been used to increase thermal stability and fluid loss control for aqueous fluids gelled with a viscoelastic surfactant (VES) in hydraulic fracturing and frac packing treatments through the apparent pseudo-crosslinking of the surfactant micelles by the nanoparticles' surface forces, which may include van der Waals and electrostatic forces as discussed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 2008/0051302 (U.S. Ser. No. 11/849,820) and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 2008020744 (U.S. Ser. No. 11/679,018), both incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. It has been discovered that the same nanoparticles will fixate formation fines in the pore matrix and onto the proppant after internal breakers in a fluid gelled with VES micelles break the viscous structure of the micelles; that is, upon VES micelle breaking most of the VES-micelle associating nanoparticles are released within the leaked-off VES fluid in the pores of the reservoir and the VES fluid remaining in the hydraulic fracture and once the nanoparticles are released they become attached, fixated, or become associated onto the surfaces of the minerals of the formation and to the fracture proppant bed (pack). Release of the nanoparticles by internally breaking VES micelles is schematically illustrated in FIG. 2 of T. Huang, et al., \u201cNanotechnology Applications in Viscoelastic Surfactant Stimulation Fluids,\u201d SPE 107728, European Formation Damage Conference, Scheveningen, The Netherlands, 30 May-1 Jun. 2007, incorporated herein by reference.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{72796=The use of transition metal ion sources as breakers for VES-gelled fluids is more fully described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2006/0041028 A1 (U.S. Ser. No. 11/145,630 filed Jun. 6, 2005), incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Briefly, the transition metal ion source used as an internal breaker may include a transition metal salt or transition metal complex, where the transition metal may be from Groups VA, VIA, VIIA, VIIIA, IB, IIB, IIIB, and IVB of the Periodic Table (previous IUPAC American Group notation). One or more chelating agents and/or one or more reducing agent sources may also be used in conjunction with the transition metal ion sources as breaking agents. In one non-limiting embodiment, the amount of transition metal ion from the transition metal ion source ranges from about 0.01 to about 300 ppm, based on the total fluid., 73699=The use of saponified fatty acids as breakers for VES gelled aqueous fluids as breakers is more fully described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2006/0211775 A1 (U.S. Ser. No. 11/372,624 filed Mar. 10, 2006), incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Briefly, the saponified fatty acids are soap reaction products of a fatty acid with an alkaline compound selected from the group consisting of organic bases, alkali metal bases, alkaline earth metal bases, ammonium bases, and combinations thereof. The soap reaction products may be pre-formed prior to addition as an internal breaker, or may be formed in situ., 35539=The particulate additives, which may also be referred to herein as stabilizing or stabilizer agents (e.g. MgO and/or Mg(OH)2, and the like), appear to improve the thermal stability of VES micelle structures when heated, that is, the VES fluid viscosity is more stable over time as fluid temperature is increased. The stabilizing agents have utility over a broad range of temperature of about 180\ufffd F. to about 300\ufffd F. (about 82\ufffd C. to about 149\ufffd C.). In many cases, the clean-up of VES fluids may be improved by use of nano size particulate additives that may be much smaller than the pores and pore-throat passages within a hydrocarbon reservoir, thereby being non-pore plugging particles that are less damaging to the reservoir permeability. Additionally, the viscosity stability of the VES fluid may be further improved by use of nano-sized particles that are able to stay within the VES fluid and travel where the VES fluid goes, including any fluid which is leaked-off, that is, any VES fluid that invades and enters the reservoir pores during a treatment, such as during a gravel-pack, frac-pack, hydraulic fracturing, and the like. Since the nano-sized particulate additives stay within the VES fluid, they thereby continue to stabilize the viscosity of the leaked-off VES fluid. This is in contrast to larger size particulate additives that become bridged-off (i.e. which plug the reservoir pores on the reservoir face and prevented from entering the reservoir pore matrix with the VES fluid), including VES stabilizer agents that are larger than about 100 to 1000 nanometers in size., 53883=The amount of nano-sized particles in the VES-gelled aqueous fluid may range from about 20 to about 500 pptg (about 2.4 to about 60 kg/1000 liters). Alternatively, the lower threshold of the proportion range may be about 5 pptg (about 0.6 kg/1000 liters), while the upper threshold of proportion of the particles may independently be about 600 pptg (about 72 kg/1000 liters) pptg., 79969=In hydraulic fracturing applications, propping agents are typically added to the base fluid after the addition of the VES. The proppant, solid particle or gravel may be any solid particulate matter suitable for its intended purpose, for example as a screen or proppant, etc. Propping agents include, but are not limited to, for instance, quartz sand grains, glass and ceramic beads, bauxite grains, sintered bauxite, sized calcium carbonate, other sized salts, walnut shell fragments, aluminum pellets, nylon pellets, and the like. The propping agents are normally used in concentrations between about 1 to 14 pounds per gallon (120-1700 kg/m3) of fracturing fluid composition, but higher or lower concentrations may be used as the fracture design requires. The base fluid may also contain other conventional additives common to the well service industry such as water wetting surfactants, non-emulsifiers and the like. In another non-restrictive embodiment, the treatment fluid may contain other viscosifying agents, other different surfactants, clay stabilization additives, scale dissolvers, biopolymer degradation additives, and other common and/or optional components., 48406=Magnesium oxide particles and powders have been used as stabilizers for VES-gelled aqueous fluids at temperatures from about 180 to about 300\ufffd F. (about 82 to about 149\ufffd C.) as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2005/0252658 A1 (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/125,465). However, it has been discovered that nano-sized particles of alkaline earth metal oxides, alkaline earth metal hydroxides, alkali metal oxides, alkali metal hydroxides, transition metal oxides, transition metal hydroxides, post-transition metal oxides, and post-transition metal hydroxides, and mixtures thereof have particular advantages for improving the thermal stability of a VES-gelled aqueous fluid, and because of their small size such particles stay with the VES-gelled fluid, rather than become bridged in the pores on the reservoir face. Thus, the use of these stabilizers may permit less amount of the VES to be used to obtain the same level of viscosity., 25830=This application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. Ser. No. 11/931,501 filed Oct. 31, 2007; U.S. Ser. No. 11/931,706 filed Oct. 31, 2007; U.S. Ser. No. 11/679,018 filed Feb. 26, 2007; and U.S. Ser. No. 11/849,820 filed Sep. 4, 2007, the latter which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60/845,916 filed Sep. 20, 2006, and in turn is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. Ser. No. 11/125,465 filed May 10, 2005 which in turn claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60/570,601 filed May 13, 2004, and is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. Ser. No. 11/755,581 filed May 30, 2007 which in turn claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60/815,693 filed Jun. 22, 2006., 29840=It has been discovered that alkaline earth metal oxides, alkaline earth metal hydroxides, transition metal oxides, transition metal hydroxides, and mixtures thereof, and in particular magnesium oxide may serve to inhibit or prevent fluid loss in aqueous fluids gelled with VESs, as described in U.S. Patent Application Application Publication No. 2008/0060812 A1 (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/755,581 filed May 30, 2007), incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. Some of these same materials may also be effective as system stabilizers and performance enhancers for aqueous fluids gelled with VESs, as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2005/0252658 A1 (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/125,465), also incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. However, even these additives may bridge on the face of the formation if the particles are sufficiently large., 72298=In another non-limiting embodiment these gel-breaking products or breakers work by rearrangement of the VES micelles from rod-shaped or worm-shaped elongated structures to spherical structures. The breaking components described herein may also include the unsaturated fatty acid or polyenoic and monoenoic components of U.S. Patent Application Publication 2006/0211776 A1, (Ser. No. 11/373,044 filed Mar. 10, 2006), incorporated herein in its entirety by reference., 31632=Fines migration is a complex phenomenon governed largely by mineralogy, permeability, salinity and pH changes, as well as drag forces created by flow velocity, turbulence and fluid viscosity, as described in detail in J. Hibbeler, et al., \u201cAn Integrated Long-Term Solution for Migratory Fines Damage,\u201d SPE 81017, SPE Latin American and Caribbean Petroleum Engineering Conference, Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, West Indies, 27-30 April 2003, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The authors note that mobilization of fines can severely damage a well's productivity, and that fines damage is a multi-parameter, complex issue that may be due to one or more of the following downhole phenomena: (1) high flow rates, particularly abrupt changes to flow rates; (2) wettability effects, (3) ion exchange; (4) two-phase flow, particularly due to turbulence that destabilize fines in the near-wellbore region; and (5) acidizing treatments of the wrong type or volume which can volume which can cause fines., 82478=Lab sand pack (20/40 mesh) tests with and without nanoparticles in VES fluids demonstrated that a sand pack containing nanoparticles can fixate formation fines in the sand pack after the VES-gelled fluid has its viscosity broken and was flowed out of the pack. The base fluid used was water containing 4 v/v % WG-3L VES, 7 wt % KCl and 3 v/v % fish oil internal breaker (Fish Oil 18:12 from Bioriginal Food & Science Corp.) The brine was gelled with the VES and mixed with 20/40 mesh (425/850 micron) sand and the viscosity broken with the internal breaker. In Example 1, no nanoparticles were added, and in Example 2, 20 pptg (2.4 kg/m3) was present in the fracturing fluid. After the fracturing fluid was broken, the mixture was poured into a one inch ID (2.5 cm) acrylic tube with a 100 mesh (150 micron) screen at the bottom of the tube to let the broken fluid flow out of the tube and keep the sand pack in the tube. The acrylic tube has a 0.125 inch (3 mm) outlet orifice at the bottom. The total packed sand length of the tube was about 12 inches (30 cm). A solution of two percent potassium chloride brine was used to flush broken fracturing fluid from the packed column before a solution containing formation fines solution was run through the pack. The introduction of fines was simulated by a simple gravity feed of 0.25% bw Rev Dust in water. The mean particle size of the Rev Dust is about 20 microns and it contains 12% Quartz, 7% Cristobalite, 4% Illite, 29% Mixed layers (Bentonite), 26% Kaolinite, and 22% Chlorite. The nanoparticles used were 35 nm MgO, product #12N-0801 available from Inframat Advanced Materials, 58952=The fluid loss control nanoparticles herein are those that produce a novel \u201cpseudo-filter cake\u201d, that is, a highly viscous layer of VES fluid composed of unique particles associating with VES micelles on the core and formation faces. The ability to generate \u201cpseudo-filter cake\u201d will significantly reduce the rate of VES fluid leak-off, similar to the polymeric-type filter cakes but through the use of completely different mechanisms than conventional polymer filter cakes. The pseudo-filter cake has leak-off control performance similar to or analogous to polymeric-type filter cake, yet the clean-up of the pseudo-filter cake is far superior to that of conventional polymeric filter cake. In polymer filter cake, most of breaker in the polymer fluid system is leaked-off into the formation matrix and leaves a high concentration of polymer in the cake (fracture). The breaker is not attached to or connected with the polymer. In VES pseudo-filter cake, the internal breaker appears to be contained or resident inside of VES micelles and thus goes wherever VES micelles go, in one non-limiting explanation. The fluid loss control nanoparticles may work from about 80\ufffd F. to about 300\ufffd F. (about 27 to about 149\ufffd C.). A wide range of particle types and properties have been found of utility to improve the performance of the VES fluid, which includes, but is not necessarily limited to, surface adsorption, crystal surface charges, piezoelectric and pyroelectric particles, and nano-sized particle properties and technology. Additionally, the synergistic use of internal breakers with the pseudo-filter cake has been discovered to allow the pseudo-filter cake to be readily degraded into an easily producible broken VES fluid. Another improved performance feature is how the fluids herein, a portion of which may inevitably leak-off into the pores of the reservoir during a treatment, can carry with it internal breaker that converts the VES fluid into an easily producible fluid without the need for contacting reservoir hydrocarbons. This is a significant improvement over conventional methods and compositions, which, without contacting hydrocarbons, exhibit very high viscosity at very low shear rates, such as 2000 cps or more at 1 sec\u22121 shear rate. The very high viscosity of VES fluids at very low shear rates makes the leaked-off VES fluid within the pores of the formation require higher reservoir pressure in order to move and remove (clean up) the fluid within the reservoir matrix. Laboratory core clean-up tests have shown that very little pressure and time is required to remove internally broken VES from the pore matrix of Berea cores as compared to VES fluids without an internal breaker., 71983=Information about using mineral oils, hydrogenated polyalphaolefin oils and saturated fatty acids as internal breakers may be found in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0056737 A1 (Ser. No. 11/517,688 filed Sep. 8, 2006), incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.}",
