            "Howard is not in such a great area, so there is constant alerts to make us aware of what is going on ion the area. They want us to be safe so we have security guard in every dorm to make sure that each person lives in that dorm. And if something were to happen to you, there are areas where it has place that if you push the button it contacts the police.",
            "Our Greek Life at Howard is amazing because many of the black fraternities and sororities started there. If you want to get involved with the Greek Life, you have to be connected because it is very secretive and you start pledging your Sophomore year.",
            "They have all state clubs, Freshman Leadership Academy, and many other clubs to name that you can get involved in.",
            "Its great for all students especially who like to party but who can stay focused at the same time.",
            "Our Homecoming is the best thing at howard because there is always something to do during that time. For one, We have a parade down Georgia Avenue, Yardfest, a fashion show, a concert, a panel discussion to help build your brand, and Gospel show.",
            "Howard is definitely bang for you buck because it has so much to offer the students not only an education but a network of people.",
            "At Howard, there is always a party, so you will find out about them on campus or at your dorm. If you want to go shopping, you can take the G2 to Georgetown and it has a movie theatre, restaurants, and a lot of shops.",
            "The food was basic dorm food, but on Thursdays, it would be soul food Thursday, which is usually the best day for food at Howard. Also there is place called the Punchout in Blackburn, which has other places to eat if you don't necessarily want the food in the cafeteria.",
            "I loved my dorm because it's no like the other dorms at Howard because it has bigger rooms and a cafeteria, so you wouldn't have to travel all the way to Blackburn.",
            "For me, my freshman year went very well but that is not the case with me other students. also I know as I go on at Howard it will get harder and harder because of the major I have chosen.",
            "At Howard, there are many distractions such as parties, boys/girls, and drugs/ alcohol, and it gets real easy to get caught up. Don't let those distractions get in your way remain focused because you went to Howard for a reason, which is to receive a higher education.",
            "Howard University is one of the top HBCUs for any African American to attend. It has the best School of Business and offers so many opportunities to their students than many other colleges. Going to Howard is world of difference than attending normal college."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{279349=Howard University is know for its epic Homecoming Celebrations. The biggest celebrities, music artist, stylist and experts from around the world travel to DC to help us celebrate our Homecoming festivities in style with a week filled with traditional events such as the Gospel Show, Comedy Show, Fashion Show and ultimately the Greek Step Show and most importantly Football Game. Homecoming is in mid to late October every year! Resfest, a competition between all the dormitories is the next biggest event and tradition at Howard, after Homecoming. Teams are formed from each dormitory to compete in Debate, Sports, Strolling, Dancing and most importantly Stepping for the Resfest Champion Title., 637148=This only got two stars because of the social aspect (and there is supposed to be more dorms built within the next 10 years). Our dorms need major reparations. In order to get the best experience I advise freshman girls to live in the Quad or the Annex, freshman boys should live in Drew Hall. DO NOT live in Meridian Hill Hall, it is a sophomore dorm and will deprive you from your freshman experience because it is a sophomore dorm and it is off campus. If you get placed there, have your parents call and complain. In around February, you'll have to pay $200 if you want to live on campus the following year. There is also a dorm that is way off campus (about 30 minutes total from campus) called University Town Center in Hyattsville, MD. It is metro- accessible and if you are used to a full kitchen and living room, this is the place for you (I recommend sophomores and up)., 715738=Stay on financial information. Register for classes in April., 459026=The dorm bathrooms and hallways are cleaned everyday and all the dorms are in great shape! In Fall 2014 there will be two new dorms housing Freshman girls and Sophomores., 864142=Check your teachers on ratemyprofessor.com and if your not an early morning person stay away from 8:10 classes. It will only lead to missing class., 930308=From recent reports, the tuition has increased by a significant amount since 2012, and that is unfortunate. From my experience, Howard has not always appropriated its funds in the best way, with the majority of the money not being sewn back into the university. With that being said, although you will have at least one score to settle or obstacle created by administration in need of a major reconstruction, you will have the memories of Homecoming and your own personal Howard experience to look forward to. So, depends on how you look at it, it may be worth it., 183290=Be yourself, the rest will follow! Get involved, whatever you can get your hands on that you are good at, do it! Volunteer, join a team or club, anything. Just get involved. GO TO CLASS! Howard has a lot of distractions, you can not let the glamour and fun take you way from your main focus! Do not get caught up in the graduating on time, there is no such thing. If an opportunity presents itself for you to study abroad or do a co-op, DO IT! Even if it means adding a semester or 2. (however make sure you have the funds to cover all of your time) Go to everything 10-30 minutes early. No matter the event or class you will benefit greatly from being early (including the cafe line) Get all of your financial aid/registration started as early as possible. If FASA opens on January 1st @ 12:00am, be there to fill it out by January 1st 12:01am. Do NOT wait until the week something is due because issues always arise and you will want time to attend to it. Stay on top of financial aid office, they are not very organized at times, and they have a lot of students to handle. Unfortunately its not all about you. Go to teachers office hours, and go often!! It benefits greatly if the teacher knows who you are and sees that you are making an effort, plus its added learning time. Don't spend you whole time planing your life, that you for get to live You miss 100% of the shoots you don't take. Take risks!, 854135=Homecoming at Howard draws over 6,000 people every September. It is a two week long tradition that spawns multiple events with iconic people., 929403=Howard University is the founding home to the majority of the Divine Nine, so be prepared to see, hear, and experience tons of Black Fraternities and Sororities participating in various events like auctions and pageants in the Fall, and probates in the Spring. The biggest event on campus is Howard Homecoming, which happens typically every October. It is one of the biggest college homecoming weeks in the country. Be prepared for lots of celebrity sightings, parades, and shows. Past guests included: Chaka Khan, Tyrese, Pooch Hall, P. Diddy, Boris Kojoe,Taraji P. Henson, Wendy Raquel Robinson, and much more., 1115936=Student organizations often host parties during the school year.Dancing and socializing are definitely big, and most students do frequent a lot of hip-hop and dance clubs in the area, namely Love and Fur. Homecoming, which occurs every year in the third week of October, is a can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?t-miss event and has been known to draw hundreds of alumni and students from schools all over the country, especially other HBCUs. Even if you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?re not yet 21, you can still enjoy DC\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?s nightlife., 633747=We are the Alpha chapter for most of the black greeks. There is First Fridays in The Punchout where we get to watch them stroll/ step. Also, in April there are the Probates. We have other greeks as well that focus on your major/ minor. They are all great for networking. *Discretion is key*}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Since I'm in the School of Business the curriculum proved to be challenging. I took 15 credit hours for my first semester freshman year and I could handle it. There are hundreds of classes to take and what's better is that you can choose what classes you want and which teacher which is a choice that I didn't have in high school. I've learned the most in my Business Orientation class about credit and how to invest money at an earlier age. During the first semester, the School of B students are put into teams where we are given different projects and presentations that we have to present to the class. These groups helped me learn how to work with others and how to formulate certain business ideas and how to market new products. Now that my first semester is over, I'm excited to see how much Howard will teach me in the coming years.
