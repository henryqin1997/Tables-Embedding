    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the description of the preferred embodiment has been quite specific, it is contemplated that various changes could be made without deviating from the spirit of the present invention. Accordingly, it is intended that the scope of the present invention be dictated by the appended claims rather than by the description of the preferred embodiment. When the printhead 10 is deactivated, the platen 11 is moved rearwardly so that it is out of engagement with the printhead. To remove the cartridge from the machine, the cover 146 of the service tray 15 is opened. This permits rearward movement of the cartridge as a result of the rearward force of the spring 139. The cartridge can then be manually removed from the tray 15. During this forward movement of the cartridge 16, the alignment pins 87, 87 in the printhead 10 engage the alignment openings 98 and 99 in the guide member 52 to properly align the guide member 52 relative to the printhead element 20. Upon initiation of a print or transfer cycle, the platen 11 moves forwardly as a result of actuation of the linear actuator 170 and forward pivoting of the arm 24 so that its shaft 26 engages and is aligned by the openings 96 within the yokes 95. The printing or transfer cycle then occurs. During such cycle, the drive rollers 106 and 112 are rotated to advance the tape 13 and",
