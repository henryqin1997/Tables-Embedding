Headless support b3 Aggregator - Maven result A powerful feature of the Aggregator is the ability to create aggregated repos that can be consumed as Maven repos, (i.e. providing the directory/file structure and artifacts required by Maven). An aggregated repository that supports Maven can be consumed both as a p2 and a Maven repo (at the same time). This flexibility is possible thanks to p2's separation of dependency meta-data and the actual location of the referenced artifacts. In order to create a Maven-conformant aggregate repo all that is required is to set the property Maven Result property of the Aggregator to true. The aggregation deployed to the Build Root location will be a Maven repo. The sample buckminster_helios_maven.b3aggr is a variation of the previous aggregations configured to produce a Maven repo.
