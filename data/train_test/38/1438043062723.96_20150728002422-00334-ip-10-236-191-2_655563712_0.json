Jack Brown provided these photos of the former event from a collection of Bob Eger. Former Gov. Edgar Whitcomb was scheduled to be the grand marshal for Sunday\u2019s parade and the Fort Knox Military Marching Band, the 115th Army Band Dragoons, were to have led the parade. Cannelton activities will continue this week, with an old-timers baseball game and history markers dinner., 33047=Copyright \u00a9 2015, 24807=Perry County News | circulation@perrycountynews.com | 812-547-3424 P.O.
