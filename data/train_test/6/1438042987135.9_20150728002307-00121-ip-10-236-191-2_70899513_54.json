In the case where the same form is being reused, such as Invoice Entry and Invoice Query, FORMFUNCTION and DATABLOCKNAME uniquely identify each Form. Form events are invoked automatically when an action is performed on an E-Business Suite Form. The AXF_CUSTOM.pll makes all events available, such as POST-INSERT, for customization. You can decide which events to use, and how and when to use them. Use the AXF_CONFIGS table to enable the AXF solution on various E-Business Suite Forms.
