    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As described above, according to the second embodiment of the present invention, on the occasion of silent condition during the facsimile training at the time of handshaking, whether the signal sending from the distant side is a voice signal or not is judged by distributing condition of the receiving energy to be input. When a voice signal is received, the automatic recording is started and thereby the time required until the start of automatic recording can possibly be reduced. Moreover, when the frequency or period are used, for example, such frequency or period is influenced due to the difference in age, sex or language used and accurate detection is impossible, however, since judgement is made based on the distributing condition of receiving energy for the voice signal to be input, detection can be made based on the characteristics which are common to all persons without influence of age, sex and language used by employing the distributing condition of receiving energy as in the case of the present invention. Accordingly, detection accuracy can be improved. In the embodiment described above, the receiving energy detecting means includes the modem 6 and CPU 1, but it is also allowed to separately provide individual receiving energy detecting means. If it is assumed that an imaginary graph is generated by repeating N times the sampling of the received energy value input, CPU 1 reads the values of received energy value buffers",
