    "textBeforeTable": "Big Download. World of Warcraft has finally received a rating in Australia, after operating for several years without a classification, as MMOGs have been allowed to operate unclassified. Blizzard explains this: \"However, back in 2004, we were advised by the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) that the online-only nature of World of Warcraft was unclassifiable under its definition of computer games at that time. Recent changes at the Classification Board have led to their ability to classify online only games such as World of Warcraft.\" The classification board disagrees, saying it should have been rated all along: \"It is the Board's view that World of Warcraft meets the definition of a computer game provided in the Classification Act and therefore can be classified.\" Either way, the game and its Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King expansions all now carry an M rating for \"fantasy violence,\" along with consumer advice stating \"online content variable.\" Thanks GameSpot Australia reports that [Oct 09, 2009, 11:59 am ET] - Share - Viewing Comments WoW Rated Down Under --> Blue's News Favorite!
