Fashions were auctioned off at a fraction of the price, making prom more accessible for some students. Students had the opportunity to sign the SCHS 2012 prom pledge, which read: \u201cI want my prom to be a night I\u2019ll remember for the rest of my life \u2014 surrounded by my best friends and full of music, dancing and fun. I don\u2019t want anything to get in the way of these memories.}",
