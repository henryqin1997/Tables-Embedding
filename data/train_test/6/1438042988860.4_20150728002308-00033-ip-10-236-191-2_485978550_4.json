That key aspect of the game hasn't been a UNM strength over several seasons, but in 2013 Beach has five arms to throw with a variety of looks. UNM's pitching has improved. The hitting, UNM's strength a season back, needs to step it up., 17522=The Aztecs can hurt you at the plate but also in the pitching circle. They have two of the top arms in the Mountain in Danielle O'Toole with a 1.86 ERA and 77 strikeouts in 86.2 innings. O'Toole has yet to give up a home run in 2013., 17215=The Aztecs are led at the plate by Lorena Bauer with a .408 average and a .827 slugging percentage. She has eight dingers, 32 RBIs and 13 doubles. You don't want to allow Bauer to beat you with her power. Patrice Jackson hits at .385 followed by Kamerin May at .360 and Kayla Jordan at .333.}",
