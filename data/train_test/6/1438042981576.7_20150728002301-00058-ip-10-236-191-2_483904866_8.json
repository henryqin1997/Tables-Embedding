In FIG. 2, each row illustrates the read, pause and read sequence for a single DRAM block. The vertical direction is test time. As will be noted, DRAM blocks are all written simultaneously and all paused simultaneously for the same predetermined pause time. However since read is performed sequentially, the read of a subsequent DRAM block not started until the completion of the read of the previous DRAM block, the total pause time for each DRAM block after the first DRAM block increases by the time required to read out all the previous DRAM blocks. However, because the pause time can be in the order of, for example, 1000 times the write and read time, this additional pause time is negligible.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{23232=Retention time testing requires reading a pattern into a block, pausing the test for a fixed amount of time, and reading out a pattern and comparing the readout pattern to an expected pattern. This sequence of write, pause, read and compare is repeated sequentially for each block of memory cell arrays in the embedded DRAM. The pause time is typically 1000 times longer than the write step or the read and compare step.}",

It will be understood that the invention is not limited to the particular embodiments described herein, but is capable of various modifications, rearrangements and substitutions as will now become apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, the invention has been illustrated using BIST, but is readily adaptable to conventional test methodologies. Therefore, it is intended that the following claims cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. ) are fuse latches 405A through 405N. During testing, fuse latches 405A through 405N are used to store the redundancy allocation information that, after scanned out, will be scanned back in order to delete the fuse banks to replace failing wordlines and bitlines with wordlines and bitlines selected from the redundancy array. This implementation saves eDRAM macro 400 real estate and the store registers automatically scale as the eDRAM macro is scaled saving design time. FIG. 4 , embedded DRAM macro 400 includes DRAM 100, BIST 110 and a multiplicity of fuse latches 405A, 405B, 405C through 405N. There is one fuse latch 405A through 405N for every DRAM block 105A through 105N in DRAM 100. Each DRAM block 105A through 105N includes a fuse bank and a",
