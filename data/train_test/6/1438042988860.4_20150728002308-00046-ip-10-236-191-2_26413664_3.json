    "textBeforeTable": "(They also happen to have joined the NFL around the same time Colston did in 2006.) Let's begin by comparing Colston to three wideouts who are considered among the best in the game, guys who certainly aren't underrated.\u00a0 Hopefully this examination will shed light on Colston's sterling resum\u00e9, especially in relation to well-known, highly-regarded receivers in the league today. The New Orleans Saints No. 1 wideout has never made a Pro Bowl or been given All-Pro distinction. While he wouldn't be considered a secret weapon, the former seventh-round pick from Hofstra doesn't get the credit he deserves in many circles.\u00a0 And it's not even close.\u00a0 Marques Colston is the most underrated receiver in the NFL.\u00a0 Comments 47 Reads 13.3K Ronald Martinez/Getty Images Use your \u2190 \u2192 (arrow) keys to browse more stories Next ARTICLE \u00bb",
    "textAfterTable": "Surprised?\u00a0 Colston's per-game numbers are clearly quite impressive across the board. In this case, they're better than Jennings in every category and Colston's receptions-per-game and touchdowns-per-game averages are on par with the undisputed top receiver in the NFL.\u00a0 Jennings, Johnson and Marshall have been named to a combined nine Pro Bowls and three First-Team All-Pro teams. Remember, the Pro Bowl is far from being the purest practice of correctly labeling the league's best players, as it's become somewhat of a yearly popularity contest.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports But the fact that Colston has never been named to one speaks to his public perception and subsequent underrated status. If 1,000-yard seasons are your thing, Colston checks out favorably in relation to his receiving peers, too.\u00a0 He has eclipsed the 1,000-yard mark in six of his seven professional seasons, tied with Reggie Wayne, Roddy White and Marshall for the most 1,000-yard campaigns since 2006.\u00a0 Altogether, Wayne, White and Marshall have been named to a whopping, yet deserved, 14 Pro Bowls and three First-Team All-Pro teams.\u00a0 The most common criticisms against Colston as an elite receiver are as such, and actually are related: Drew Brees' consistently prolific, pass-happy offense inflates Colston's statistics and his comparatively lower single-season receiving yard career high of 1,202.\u00a0 Brees' quarterbacking brilliance and high-volume passing attack are undoubtedly beneficial to Colston.\u00a0",
