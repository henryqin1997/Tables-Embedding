It's a huge fight for me, it would place me with the top fighters and give me the respect I feel I deserve, especially if I can go out and smash him.\", 1010=Demetrious \"Mighty Mouse\" Johnson slammed his hands down on his UFC flyweight championship belt. Somewhere else in Rogers Arena, Rory MacDonald surely looked on with envy. Johnson and MacDonald put on dominant performances in the UFC's first trip to Vancouver in three years. Johnson defended his title for the fourth time, not allowing Ali Bagautinov to win any of their five fast-paced rounds. That couldn't quite top MacDonald, who barely let Tyron Woodley touch him in an all-important welterweight co-main event. MacDonald hopes the performance leads him to an opportunity to claim space alongside Johnson in the UFC champion's club., 27092=Steve Cantwell applies an armbar to Razak Al-Hassan in the first round of their bout at UFC\u2019s Fight for the Troops show on December 10, 2008. The bout ended when Cantwell won by TKO after dislocating Al-Hassan\u2019s\u00a0elbow., 24962=It took time, but Cantwell eventually proved himself to Blumgren and his jiu-jitsu trainer Sergio Pehna, winning several amateur grappling and kickboxing tournaments before making his WEC MMA debut in 2007. Now in the UFC, Cantwell faces arguably the biggest fight of his career this Saturday, when he takes on Luis Cane (10-1-1) on the televised portion of UFC 97 at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Canada. Cane's lone UFC defeat came in the form of a disqualification for an illegal kick to the head of James Irvin in 2007.}",
