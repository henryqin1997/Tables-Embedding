My J3 came in white, and I was very pleased with that color. The white was innocuous enough to avoid screaming \"LOOK AT ME!\" but also stood out with that bright sheen. Those who like their color palette on the more inconspicuous side would like the black. There is a fairly solid-feeling screen with a metal plate obtruding the bottom part. I didn't really like the extra space on the bottom: it made the 3.3\" screen look smaller. But then again, the space is convenient for holding up the device. On the right (with screen facing towards you) there is a Next/Prev track rocker, below that a Play/Pause button, and way below that a volume rocker. Being used to the iPod, I would have appreciated the volume rocker at the top, but it works., 1469=3.3-inch 16:9 Wide AMOLED, 16 million colors, res. 480x272, ultra portable.

Thankfully, my brother directed me to this., 34791=I used the J3 with vsonic gr07, sony ex1000 and don't think it is a very good sounding PMP.}",
