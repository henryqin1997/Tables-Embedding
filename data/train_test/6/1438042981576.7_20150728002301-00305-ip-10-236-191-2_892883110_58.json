This is the time to blow off some serious steam before finals and get free food, gifts, gags, and concert tickets with awesome attractions like local bands and glowing foam pits., 270527=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 15033=The cost is definitely worth it. Brockport is one of the cheapest SUNY schools, but they are awesome. Most impressive is their food service that has been rated number 1 since 1994., 115851=Clubs and activities are abundant here. Brockport has a full workout area, tennis courts, racquetball courts, squash courts, basketball, an ice rink, and the SERC Project which should be completed in the Summer of 2012. The SERC project is yet another recreational facility that further expands what it already has., 135752=Brock-the-Port is an end of the year party in May with live concerts and food that student and the Brockport community celebrates., 26749=University Police is known to employ parking-ninjas to keep our campus and parking violators in line. See 3:40 at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3LheUVj2M&feature=youtu.be. But besides that, its in your best interest to respect the police here and call on them when you need the slightest of help because they are friendly and great service men and women. All in all, I feel safe at home here., 195125=Other than the obnoxious drunks who trample around at 3:00 in the morning, dorm life is quaint. Anything negative only happens because of careless dorm-mates. Sometimes the R.A.s treat us like irresponsible high school students, but they're just looking out for the building as a whole, and most of us do act like that.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Free stuff everywhere you go almost. Whenever there is a school sponsored activity like free messages they give away free stress balls. All the late nights include food and pop/water. The food is amazing. The classes are great. Am enjoying being here The campus is amazing. There is so much stuff to do. Every weekend there is Late Night with Ellsworth and the theme for it is different each weekend. There are things that go on during the week. So many free giveaways and free food. Am learning a lot The classes are good. So far I have not had a tough time. The professors are engaging and none of mine so far have talked in a monotone. There is so much information to soak in.
