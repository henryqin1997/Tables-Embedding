Thanks to the rhythmic contraction of these muscles, foodstuffs always progress in one direction only. But why? A team of researchers led by Jan Huizinga of McMaster University in Canada investigated this subject, examining the cells that bring about this one-way movement. They used micro-electrodes located along the digestive tract to establish that the so-called interstitial cells of Cajal set up a constant, regular electrical current. This current permits the muscles, that surround the intestine wall, to contract constantly. However, the presence of an electrical current is not sufficient for this mechanism to function. The current must also be set up with a flawless rhythm. Within the intestines, therefore, the cells of Cajal set up a web that allows them to give off electrical impulses at the same rhythm.

The digestive system\u2019s flawless creation, which never gives rise to any confusion, belongs to Allah. One of the small intestine\u2019s special features is its ability to absorb just enough of certain needed substances. For example, too much iron can harm the body. Iron reaching the intestines above a particular level is excreted without being digested. Were this not to happen, the result would be serious illnesses. In addition, as mentioned earlier, regions in a very special part of the small intestine are composed of cells prepared to absorb Vitamin B12. People who have this area of their intestines surgically removed must receive additional vitamin supplements, or they will die. Small intestine Furry protrusion Epithelium Submucosa seroza Mucosa",
