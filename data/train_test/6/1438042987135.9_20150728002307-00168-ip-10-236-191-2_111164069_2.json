He has been in this awful shelter far too long, since November 2011.\u00a0When you factor in the long hours spent alone, minimal people contact, no outings, walks, exercise, regular routine, nothing different to see, no-one to trust or love him, plus the fact that he gets minimum time to be fed and clean his cage, it\u2019s no wonder he is unstable and doesn\u2019t trust or respect new people.\u00a0Only one person has worked with him, trying different things. Its a trust issue for Pichou, he has no one he can trust, no one who truly loves him and shows him love and respect.\u00a0\u00a0Its sad to know from one volunteer who saw him over a year ago, that he was at that time, he was the happiest dog to be rescued. Now one year later, with other dogs coming and going, some who he got along with and some not,\u00a0the isolation,\u00a0it has all taken a toll on him.\u00a0He needs a miracle to find the right person to work with him as he is not trustworthy in his present state.\u00a0Miracles do happen, right?\u00a0Pichou\u2019s history helps to understand why he is who he is now. He needs someone with whom he can learn to trust again. We desperately need to find this special person which is why we are knocking at your door. Let us know if you want to meet Pichou. That might help you make the decision.\u00a0PLEASE!\u00a0\u00a0Post, email, FB, share with everyone you know. That special person is out there. Pichou is special \u2013 lets help them meet each other. \u00a0Do not hesitate to contact me for any information you may need or question you may have regarding dear Pichou. \u00a0please contact\u00a0alexiapearce@rogers.com, 13175=June 30, 2013, 54612=Whole document: You should recognize the very crucial role wild horses & wild burros play in preventing catastrophic wildfires by eating the coarser, drier, more flammable vegetation over broad areas and their converting this via their droppings into rich and moist soils.\u00a0 With their post-gastric digestive system, they are ideally equipped in this capacity. To ignore this salient biological fact is wrong.\u00a0 The ruminant grazers: deer, elk, bighorn, cattle, etc., are not nearly as capable in this regard and burn up their metabolisms in the more thorough digestive processing of such dry and coarse vegetation.\u00a0 In the era of Global Warming, this is a major consideration, as the wild horses & burros, if allowed to fill their niches, will greatly assist in catastrophic fire prevention.\u00a0 In many regions where equid populations have been either drastically reduced or eliminated, catastrophic and extensive fires have resulted due to their no longer being able to consume and process the dry vegetation for which their post-gastric digestive systems are ideally suited.
