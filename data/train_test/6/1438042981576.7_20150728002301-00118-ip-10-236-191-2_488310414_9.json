It would be understood therefore that this embodiment of the invention is intended as an exemplification of the invention only and that the invention is not limited thereto. It is to be understood therefore that it is intended in the appended claims to cover all modifications and equivalences which fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. Furthermore, by using the above described contact, much lower force is required to maintain good electrical contact between the conductor(s) and the termination surfaces. In addition to a two wire termination contact, the above-described contact is also a superior single wire insulation displacement contact because of the ability of the beams to relieve the stress on the C-shaped legs. Therefore, a broader range of outside diameters of wires may be terminated because of this stress relief feature. In fact, the process of terminating the second conductor 78 often enhances the termination of the first conductor 76. After the first conductor 76 is terminated, the legs deflect resulting in a divergence of the termination surfaces 42 and 44. When the second conductor 78 is moved through gap 45 in a direction indicated by arrow 47 shown in FIG. 5, the second conductor 78 often strikes the first conductor 76 to move further, and thus tighter,",
