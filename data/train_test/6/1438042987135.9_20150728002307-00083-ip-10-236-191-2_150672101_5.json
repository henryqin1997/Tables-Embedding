I mean, it makes some amount of sense because jack planes are set more open than smoothers (for example) and the finest smoothers are even tighter.

I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just me, but setting the iron seems to be an almost esoteric art. I have 8 planes, nothing fancy, just the standard Stanley/Bailey\u2019s, 409 Sargent, 414 Sargent, #7 Stanley, 60 1/2 Stanley, and a small record block plane or two. Each one I need to work at setting the blade depth correctly. My Stanley #5 takes a whole different setup than my Sargent 414. My Stanley #4 is completely different from my Sargent 409. I have a wood 24\u201d shipwrights plane that I have still never figured out how to set up. Certified built in 1754, a nice lady at TX.

You must be Have your say...show next 15 replies showing 1 through 15 of 44 replies View all replies \u00bb In all, I still am learning about the mouth opening. It does help if I push down the plane hard with small opening on bad grain but not much. On against grain it does help well to close the mouth gap. If the tearout is occurring I will adjust the blade height first then the chipbreaker. The mouth would be the last. I generally have the mouth midway unless it is heavy stock removal which I need the mouth all the way open. The mouth is suppose to minimize tearout if the plane was push down hard on the surface. If the grain is too bad then it does not matter if the mouth is super close.",
