More so the variety of characters and titles these certain individuals posses such as pyromancer, necromancer, cartomancer, or a summoner. And what exactly do they mean? HA! Well my friends, welcome to the world of clairvoyance, and if you so happen to be one you will not be regarded as weird or crazy, but lethal! The year is somewhere in the vicinity of 2059 and the location is London, England. Paige Mahoney is a clairvoyant; an extremely rare one. And what exactly happens to people that posses such rare gifts? Well of course they\u2019re hunted down! When the day finally comes she is taken to a nearby \u201cabandoned\u201d city, and learns of the Rephaim, a savage group of non-humans who pretend to take-in clairvoyants and rehabilitate them, but in actuality they\u2019re consuming them and in some cases, stealing their gifts. Overall, it\u2019s a good read. The one downside, and of course this is all personal, was the lack of suspense. For a story like this, you know running-from the law and trying to escape the \u201cnetherworld\u201d, I was expecting more challenges, but there weren\u2019t that many and sometimes the story fell flat. Don\u2019t let my points of view dissuade you. \u201cBone Season\u201d is a series, and the next book could potentially be better. ...more",

The show is outstanding and the books are on demand everywhere! This graphic novel series is going to blow you away! My favorite aspect of this series is the artwork. It was perfectly sanctioned! Tommy Patterson becomes a god when in the presence of pencil and paper. I wasn\u2019t actually disturbed with the unfamiliarity of some of the characters as far as their physical appearance goes, which is something George Martin comments about in the Preface. Overall, I was pleased with the first novel. I\u2019m not sure if others would agree with me, but at times I felt like I must have been reading from the TV show script, because the dialogue between both the characters on paper and the TV show was synchronized. Alas, I am very pleased with Volume One! ...more",

If the ending were any different I would have been upset! Bodey was my favorite character in the series. Yes, he\u2019s the youngest (a child), but his energy and optimism were exactly what the Locke family desperately needed throughout this whole ordeal! I was mesmerized with all the extravagant keys that it\u2019s hard to just choose one to hold onto forever. I absolutely recommend this series to fantasy lovers, ghost lovers, key lovers, and all Joe Hill readers! Oh and one more thing. The artwork in this series is impeccable! Applause applause applause to Gabriel Rodriguez! ...more",

It contains vol #1-48 and let me tell you what a ride this was!I\u2019m late on watching the TV series, but that doesn\u2019t really bother me! Fundamentally speaking, this series is pervasive, mind-churning, and it\u2019s really a thoughtful way of exploring our internal values, morals, but more importantly, I believe it can determine your overall strengths and weaknesses. \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d will undoubtedly make you think about what you would do in any of the situations that the characters in the Walking Dead find themselves in. Personally, I found myself saying \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done that!\u201d or \u201cwhoa I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m on the same page as so and so.\u201d In a weird way you get see what kind of people could potentially survive a cataclysmic event like this. Could you fathom killing, leaving loved-ones behind, or handle betrayals? ...more",

Totally expected to hate this book as I tend to dislike crime novels and this one's about gun running and border cartels. Delighted to say I was wrong. Parker's characters are intriguing.

I'm looking forward to starting from the beginning of this series. ...more",

It's very Upstairs/Downstairs with the maid who rises above her station - kind of like the first season on Downton. This book loses it for me a bit in a contrived writing style. The author starts off fully staging a mystery and then just full stops and begins a historical section, not as flashbacks, but fully stops the narrative. We're taken backwards in character time and spend several chapters living there; then just as suddenly we're transported right back into the mystery which then chugs along only to end up trying to marry the two narratives. I'm not saying it can't be done; it's just not well done here. Looking forward to book #2 in the hopes that now that the back story is out the author will no longer feel the need to tell two stories on independent tracks. ...more"
