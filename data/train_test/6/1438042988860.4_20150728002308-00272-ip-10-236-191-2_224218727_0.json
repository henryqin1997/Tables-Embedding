            "Darrow - #88 Carpainter appears! Now if only there was someone willing to fund a sitcom with him and Giygas playing roommates.",
            "Darrow - #89 Carpainter may not have the most interesting backstory, but wow, does he know how to dress. I'd harbor evil feelings, too, if my beanie was ruined."
