In 2015 he lost the Ding Liren - Gelfand (2015) match by 1-3 (=2 -2)., 72808=FIDE Grand Prix Baku 2014 : joint winner, 29859=Qualifying by rating for the 2014-15 Grand Prix Series portion of the 2016 World Championship cycle, Gelfand was =1st alongside Fabiano Caruana with 6.5/11 in the first leg of the Series, namely the FIDE Grand Prix Baku (2014). This earned Gelfand 155 GP points. In the second leg, the FIDE Grand Prix Tashkent (2014), Gelfand suffered a lapse of form, placing =11th and earning only an extra 15 GP points. Although he performed strongly at the final leg of the series at FIDE Grand Prix Khanty-Mansiysk (2015), it was insufficient to qualify for the Candidates Tournament of 2016., 20858=<Age> Gelfand won the Junior Championship of the Soviet Union with 9/11 in January 1985, at the age of 16, a half point ahead of Vassily Ivanchuk. He came =1st (2nd on count back to Joel Lautier) in the World Junior Championship in 1988 and became European Junior Champion in 1989., 37788=He first entered the top 100 in July 1988 with a bullet, when he leapt to #33 in the world while still an IM, one who had just turned 20, and has remained in the top 100 since that time., 24387=Gelfand finished 6th at the FIDE World Cup (2005), which produced 10 Candidates for the 2007 Candidates tournament, defeating Watu Kobese, Ruben Felgaer, Levan Pantsulaia, and Dreev in the preliminary rounds. In the two rounds of matches at the 2007 Candidates, Gelfand won both the Candidates Match: Gelfand - Kasimdzhanov (2007) and the Candidates Match: Gelfand - Kamsky (2007) to qualify for the FIDE World Championship Tournament (2007) in Mexico City, where he tied for second with Kramnik, a point behind the winner, Anand. Subsequently, he won the World Cup (2009) by defeating Judit Polgar, the then reigning World Junior Champion Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Dmitry Jakovenko, and Sergey Karjakin to reach the final, where he then faced former FIDE World Champion Ruslan Ponomariov, winning the match 7-5 in a playoff. In doing so he qualified for the World Championship Candidates (2011) for another shot at the World Championship in 2012. He played and defeated Shakhriyar Mamedyarov by 2.5-1.5 (+1 =3 -0) in the first round of the World Championship Candidates (2011), moving into the semi final where defeated Gata Kamsky in the tiebreaker; the result was 2-2 (+0 -0 =4) in the classical games, 2-2 (+1 -1 =2) in the rapid tiebreaker, and 1.5-0.5 in his favour in the blitz tiebreaker. He faced Alexander Grischuk in the final match, and after five draws, Gelfand won the sixth and final game thus gaining the right to challenge Viswanathan Anand for the world crown. The Anand - Gelfand World Chess Championship (2012) was played in Moscow in May 2012, and Gelfand lost in the rapid game tiebreaker 1.5-2.5 (-1 =3) after drawing the 12 games played under classical time controls 6-6 (+1 -1 =10). As the loser in the World Championship match, he qualified to play in the World Championship Candidates (2013) in London, where he placed a rating-enhancing 5th with 6.5/14 (+2 -3 =9)., 38529=Interview: Part 1 - http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail...; Part 2 - http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail... and Part 3 - http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail...

Article by the Indian Express dated 6 May 2012: http://www.indianexpress.com/news/m..., 27733=Gelfand\ufffds results in the FIDE Grand Prix 2008-2010 were modest, coming 11th. His 2014 World Championship campaign started well when he placed =1st alongside Veselin Topalov and Shakhriyar Mamedyarov at the FIDE Grand Prix London (2012), scoring 7/11 (+4 -1 =6; TPR 2836) and netting GP 140 points from the event. However, his 10th place out of 12 placement at the FIDE Grand Prix Tashkent (2012) and his =9th at the FIDE Grand Prix Beijing (2013) eliminated him for the contest for the top two in the Grand Prix series, and attendant qualification into the 2014 Candidates Tournament. However, a strongly motivated player, Gelfand placed =1st (2nd on tiebreak) at the FIDE Grand Prix Paris (2013) alongside Fabiano Caruana to place 4th in the Grand Prix series with 325 points., 20263=Boris Gelfand's longevity as a player, and his ability to maintain his playing strength, are legendary. Born in Minsk in Belarus (then part of the USSR), he emigrated to Israel in 1998 where he currently resides. One of the most experienced of the elite players in the world, he has been a contender for the World Championship for most of his life, starting in 1991 when he first contested the Candidates, and culminating with his closely fought if unsuccessful challenge for the world crown in 2012 when he was 44 years old., 29026=He had another chance to qualify for the Candidates via the World Cup (2013) to which he qualified by rating; he defeated Bangladeshi GM Ziaur Rahman in the first round, Uzbek GM Anton Filippov in the 2nd round and Ukrainian GM Alexander Moiseenko in the third round. However, he was eliminated by eventual semi-finalist French GM Maxime Vachier-Lagrave in the Round of 16 (round 4), reversing the same result against the same player in the same round of the World Cup of 2009., 36249=Like most top players, Gelfand is a skilled rapid player. He was =1st with Kramnik in the rapid play section of the 2001 Amber event, and outright 1st in the 2002 edition of Amber's rapid play section. He came first in the 2002 Cap d'Agde, defeating Karpov in the final. In 2003, he defeated Polgar in the George Marx Rapid Match (2003) and in 2007, he came =1st at the Villa de Canada de Calatrava (2007), following up with =1st at the Pivdenny Bank Chess Cup (2008) in Odessa. He also won the 2009 ACP World Rapid Cup (2009) with a 3-1 win over Svidler in the finals and won the Leko - Gelfand Match (2010) rapid match in Hungary by 4.5-3.5. Most recently, he defeated Aronian in the Leon Rapid (2010) and made the final of the London Chess Classic (Knockout) (2013). However in July, he lost a rapid match to Svidler by 3-5., 22166=Gelfand competed in all the knockout tournaments that either determined the World Championship, or was part of the World Championship cycle apart from the 2004 tournament in Tripoli. In the knockout tournament that was held in Groningen in 1997, he defeated Lautier in round three, where he was seeded directly because of his results in the last FIDE cycle, and then beat Vladislav Tkachiev and Alexey Dreev before bowing out to the winner of the tournament, Viswanathan Anand. In the world championship knockout tournament of 1999 held in Las Vegas, Gelfand was seeded into the second round where he defeated Jonathan Speelman, and then beat Lautier in round three before losing to the eventual winner, Alexander Khalifman. In 1999 in New Delhi, he was again seeded into round 2 where he defeated Emir Dizdarevic, and then Jeroen Piket in round three before he was defeated by Alexey Shirov in round four. In the 2001-02 knockout tournament held in Moscow, Gelfand lost to Peter Svidler in round 5 after defeating Alexis Cabrera, Leinier Dominguez Perez, Aleksander Delchev and Zurab Azmaiparashvili. He played in the 8-player 2002 Dortmund Tournament, which was the Candidates for the Classical World Chess Championship match in 2004, but failed to reach the semi-finals after coming third in the quadrangular round robin preliminary round., 21323=<World> In 1990, Gelfand won the Manila Interzonal to qualify as a Candidate for the 1993 World Championship. At the 1991 Candidates, he prevailed over Predrag Nikolic, but was then defeated in the quarter final by eventual Candidates winner and championship challenger Nigel Short. He qualified for the FIDE 1994 Candidates event by winning the last Interzonal in Biel, beating Michael Adams and Vladimir Kramnik only to lose to Anatoly Karpov in the finals., 13800=NOTABLE GAMES: [what is this?] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gelfand vs Shirov,\u00a01998 1-0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mamedyarov vs Gelfand,\u00a02011 0-1 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gelfand vs Jobava,\u00a02011 1-0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gelfand vs Kramnik,\u00a01994 1-0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gelfand vs Anand,\u00a02012 1-0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gelfand vs Anand,\u00a02012 1/2-1/2 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gelfand vs Adams,\u00a02013 1-0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gelfand vs Anand,\u00a01993 1-0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gelfand vs Aronian,\u00a02013 1-0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nakamura vs Gelfand,\u00a02013 0-1 WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS: [what is this?] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FIDE World Championship Knockout Tournament (2001) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FIDE World Championship Tournament (2007) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anand - Gelfand World Chess Championship (2012) NOTABLE TOURNAMENTS: [what is this?] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Manila Interzonal (1990) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FIDE World Cup (2005) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0World Cup (2009) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pamplona Tournament (2004) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rising Stars - Experience (2010) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bermuda Round Robin (2004) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FIDE Grand Prix Paris (2013) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FIDE Jermuk Grand Prix (2009) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a016th Amber Tournament (Blindfold) (2007) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FIDE Grand Prix London (2012) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Enghien-les-Bains (2003) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Karen Asrian Memorial (2008) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pivdenny Bank Chess Cup (2008) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pivdenny Bank Chess Cup (2007) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Olympiad (2008) GAME COLLECTIONS: [what is this?] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Match Gelfand! by amadeus \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gelfand's Games 4 Study by jakaiden \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Boris Gelfand: My Most Memorable Games by Resignation Trap \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0English: Boris Gelfand Collection by chess.master \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Boris in the najdorf by deepthinker \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Najdorf - 6.
