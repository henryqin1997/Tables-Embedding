    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets Modifications and variations such as would be apparent to a skill addressee are considered within the scope of the present invention. For example, the camera position controller could have a single switch to control toggling between two camera locations. Also, the iris setting of the video lens and camera could also be controlled. This facility could be configured into a logical data stack so that the last, say 10, viewing positions could be stored in memory are recalled sequentially (this feature is herein referred to as \u201cback up\u201d). Typically, the camera position controller is configured to set the last viewing position as being any position at which the operator stopped for greater than, say, 1 second. Thus a PTZ camera can be used to monitor two fixed locations within a viewing area, as well as to operate under fully manual control. Hence, the PTZ camera of the present invention is the equivalent of two fixed position cameras which can be set to view locations of temporary interest and which can be set to new locations of temporary interest as desired by an operator. That is, the PTZ camera function as the equivalent of two dynamically positioned fixed cameras. Also, the change time in changing between the two viewing locations is about the same as the time involved in changing viewing between two fixed cameras (that is, less than 1 second). The location of the targets",
