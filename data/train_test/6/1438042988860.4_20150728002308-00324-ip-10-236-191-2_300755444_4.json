It's a great honor and an important part of our Centennial celebration that the iconic image of the Marmon 'Wasp' will be seen on mail sent from coast to coast.\", 170585=1969 Indianapolis 500 winner Mario Andretti visited the Speedway today and talked about the 100th Anniversary Indianapolis 500., 187547=Joining Donahoe in dedicating the stamp were Greg Ballard, Indianapolis mayor; Jeff Belskus, Indianapolis Motor Speedway Corporation president and chief executive officer and Pancho Carter, 1985 Indianapolis 500 pole winner., 171197=JAQUES LAZIER: \"Obviously, this is Indy, and the fact that it is the 100-year anniversary makes it that much more special. It puts that much more pressure on every single team owner and every single driver to make the show. There's always an opportunity. We got in (a car) at the last second for (A.J.) Foyt and just barely missed the field last year. I'm ready to give it another attempt this year. Right now, I would say there isn't that much going on. Obviously, things can change between now and 6 o'clock on Sunday.\", 180625=From 8 a.m.-6 p.m. on Pole Day, the Pace Cars will be staged for a \"Fans Choice\" vote. The cars also will be on display in the infield from 8 a.m.-6 p.m. on Bump Day/IMS Armed Forces Day on Sunday, May 22., 185379=The award was initiated in 1967 to recognize automotive pioneer Louis Schwitzer., 186206=James Goodloe, Roger Griffiths, Marcelo Martinelli and Robert Bell of Honda Performance Development (HPD) received the 45th annual BorgWarner Louis Schwitzer Award on May 20 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway for their development of the Honda Refueling Safety Interlock System., 180906=Another featured car at the Indianapolis 500 Pace Car Reunion will be the Chevrolet Camaro from the 1969 \"500\" won by Mario Andretti. The 100th Anniversary Indianapolis 500 Chevrolet Camaro Pace Car is painted to look exactly like its 1969 predecessor., 182868=Sure enough, on May 30, 1911, Harroun crossed the finish line first with an average speed of 74.602 miles per hour - and he only had to change one tire for the whole race - in winning the inaugural Indianapolis 500. In the 100th Anniversary Indy 500, the 62nd driver to take the checkered flag first will be on Firestone tires., 187997=Ray Harroun, winner of the first Indianapolis 500 in 1911, began racing his Marmon \"Wasp\" through the nation's mail stream Friday, May 20 in the form of 50 million First-Class Mail Forever stamps to celebrate 100 years of racing at the iconic Indianapolis 500., 180229=2010 Indianapolis 500 Chase Rookie of the Year Simona De Silvestro talked today about the crash Thursday in which she suffered second-degree burns to her right hand and superficial burns to her left hand. She has not been cleared to drive and will be re-evaluated Saturday by INDYCAR Medical Director Dr. Michael Olinger., 169826=Andretti Autosport announced today it has signed Grime Boss, a brand of heavy-duty hand-cleaning wipes manufactured by Nice-Pak, to a sponsorship agreement in support of the team's salute to America's armed forces, which begins with the 100th anniversary edition of the Indianapolis 500 and continues through the remainder of the 2011 IZOD IndyCar Series season., 174996=A: One day of qualifying would take place from noon-6 p.m. Sunday, May 22, with all 33 positions up for grabs.

This special two-day event, which will be highlighted by the ceremonial pace lap just after 6 p.m. Pole Day, will showcase the largest collection of vintage Indianapolis 500 Pace Cars ever assembled., 184706=PATRICK DONAHOE (U.S. Postmaster General): \"Man, that was a thrill! I'll tell you what, when you see them come out of the pits, they're moving, but it's amazing how they go by in a blink.\" (About issuing Indianapolis 500 stamp): \"It's been a great day with the kickoff of the stamp, and we're really proud to be here. Seeing the first car to win (1911 Marmon Wasp), that was exciting, then getting a chance to meet Johnny Rutherford and A.J. Foyt and coming out with the flag, it's a great day.\", 160505=JAMES HINCHCLIFFE (No. 06 Sprott Newman/Haas Racing): \"I think the Sprott team made a lot of good gains today. When we first went out, the temperatures were obviously a lot hotter than they had been in all the running we had done. As a result of that, the car was quite lively this morning. We had a couple of runs where we had a very loose race car, but that's all part of the Indy education and learning curve, having some proper loose runs and learning how to deal with those. We came in and made a series of changes, and every single one of them was pointing the car in a better direction. And at the end, there we went out around 4 o'clock and made a couple of new tire runs still not in full qualifying trim and set some very competitive times in very clean air. We're very happy with the gains we made, not only overnight from yesterday but also during the day. We're now just looking forward to seeing what tomorrow brings. We parked it a bit early because we had no interest in competing in the \"tow Olympics\" and going for those gigantic laps. We were focused on running by ourselves today. We're looking forward to qualifying. Hopefully we can be a first day qualifier and be able to breathe a little bit easier on Sunday. The four-lap qualifying format is obviously something new for me on ovals because in Indy Lights it was only a two-lap average. In these cars, especially here - although I haven't qualified on any other oval in these cars - the car changes a lot over four laps. Inside the car, we have a lot of tools that we can use to tune the car, so, for me, part of today was getting a feel for the car over the course of four laps and what adjustments I can make to fix a problem. That was a good experience for me to have. I learned a lot, but I'm certainly not at the level of these experienced guys who know almost before they get to the corner what they're going to need to do and can adjust the car two or three times a lap. We're chipping away at it bit by bit, so I'm looking forward to making that first attempt.\", 174399=TOM BIGELOW: (About the 100th Anniversary Indianapolis 500): \"It's just fabulous. It was neat being a part of this. This is the greatest spectacle in the world. I am really pleased to be here.\" (How much different is it now compared to when you first came here?) \"A whole lot. These new garage areas are nothing like the old ones. I think we may have had a little more atmosphere with those old garages, a little more camaraderie. Everybody would kind of go visit each other. Today, you have to go knock on their door and ask to come in.\" (What is your favorite experience here?) \"Probably finishing sixth in 1977 with A.J. Watson and Ralph Wilkie. That was a really fabulous time.\", 178124=2011 INDIANAPOLIS 500 POLE DAY QUALIFYING PROCEDURE:, 169075=Nice-Pak, founded in 1957, is the global leader in the design, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of premium quality branded and private label wet wipe products. Headquartered in Orangeburg, N.Y., Nice-Pak has a track record of introducing innovative products for personal care, baby, health, hand sanitizing, beauty and household applications.

The 1911 Indianapolis 500 was the first major auto race ever to use a Pace Car, which is now a tradition at races around the world. At the wheel of the Stoddard-Dayton at the 1911 \"500\" was Carl G. Fisher, one of the founders of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway., 167655=Concerned individuals can more closely follow the program's progress in three languages; English, Japanese and Chinese. Through 'With you Japan,' people will learn various ways to help provide special care to thousands of children in Japan as they begin to rebuild their lives after the devastating earthquakes and tsunami in March., 173595=1981 Indianapolis 500 veteran Bob Lazier visited the track today.

The first-day-of-issue dedication ceremony took place at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway during the Fast Friday practice for the 100th Indianapolis 500. Joining Donahoe in dedicating the stamp were Greg Ballard, Indianapolis mayor; Jeff Belskus, Indianapolis Motor Speedway Corporation president and chief executive officer and Pancho Carter, 1985 Indianapolis 500 pole winner. The Indianapolis 500 Forever Stamp is always equal in value to the current First-Class Mail one-ounce rate. PATRICK DONAHOE (U.S. Postmaster General): \"At the Postal Service, we understand the power of our stamps in celebrating American history and culture - in this case, the 100th anniversary of the Indianapolis 500. I won't be so bold as to predict the winner of the race, but I will predict that 50 or 100 years from now the U.S. Postal Service will issue another stamp to commemorate the next milestone",
