    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{39860=The conventional surgical procedures (such as those described above) for coronary artery bypass grafting using saphenous vein or internal thoracic artery via an open-chest approach have been described and illustrated in detail. See generally Stuart W. Jamieson, Aortocoronary Saphenous Vein Bypass Grafting, in ROB & SMITH'S OPERATIVE SURGERY: CARDIAC SURGERY, 454-470 (Stuart W. Jamieson & Norman E. Shumway eds., 4th ed. 1986); LUDWIG K. VON SEGESSER, ARTERIAL GRAFTING FOR MYOCARDIAL REVASCULARIZATION: INDICATIONS, SURGICAL TECHNIQUES AND RESULTS 48-80 (1990). Conventional cardiopulmonary bypass techniques are outlined in Mark W. Connolly & Robert A. Guyton, Cardiopulmonary Bypass Techniques, in HURST'S THE HEART 2443-450 (Robert C. Schlant & R. Wayne Alexander eds., 8th ed. 1994). Coronary artery bypass grafting, utilizing open-chest techniques but without cardiopulmonary bypass, is described in Enio Buffolo et al., Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Without Cardiopulmonary Bypass, 61 ANN. THORAC. SURG. 63-66 (1996), 42358=Finally, some techniques remain in the experimental stages, and are limited to animal testing. Direct laser canalization of cardiac musculature (as opposed to canalization of coronary artery feeding the cardiac musculature) is described in Peter Whittaker et al., Transmural Channels Can Protect Ischemic Tissue: Assessment of Long-term Myocardial Response to Laser- and Needle-Made Channels, 94(1) CIRCULATION 143-152 (Jan. 1, 1996)., 27779=The present application is a continuation of and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/689,773 filed Aug. 13, 1996 entitled \"Method And Apparatus For Performing Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery\" and filed in the name of the same inventors as the present application. The present application also discloses and claims subject matter disclosed in commonly assigned and concurrently filed U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/054,815 entitled \"Closed Chest Coronary Bypass\" (filed in the name of the same inventors as the present application and filed as a continuation application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/689,773) (now U.S. Pat. No. 5,755,682)., 48825=Depending on the relationship over time of the pressures present within the chamber of the heart as compared to the pressures realized within the coronary artery at the bypass location, a check valve permitting unidirectional blood flow from the chamber of the heart into the coronary artery may be associated with the apparatus. The use of a check valve, and the opening pressure of such a valve when employed, can be individually determined through selective catheterization of the coronary artery and the chamber of the heart either prior to, or at the time of, the bypass procedure. See Minoru Hongo et al., Effects of Heart Rate on Phasic Coronary Blood Flow Pattern and Flow Reserve in Patients with Normal Coronary Arteries: A study with an Intravascular Doppler Catheter and Spectral Analysis, 127(3) AM. HEART J. 545-51 (March 1994) (outlining newer techniques by which pressures within the coronary artery can be measured during the normal cardiac cycle). Simultaneous electrocardiography may also be useful in this regard. Such catheterization and blood pressure measurements performed in concert with stress testing and electrocardiography can be utilized to determine what minimal pressures are necessary within the bypassed coronary artery to produce adequate blood flow at rest and during stress. Correlation of the pressure necessary within the coronary artery to that present within the chambers of the heart can be used to establish the appropriate chamber of the heart to utilize. In the most preferred embodiment, the left ventricle is anticipated., 31044=Angioplasty, and the other above-described techniques (although less invasive than coronary artery bypass grafting) are fraught with a correspondingly greater failure rate due to plaque reformation. Contemporary reports suggest re-stenosis is realized in as many as 25 to 55 percent of cases within 6 months of successful angioplasty. See Bojan Cercek et al., 68 AM. J. CARDIOL. 24C-33C (Nov. 4, 1991). It is presently believed stenting can reduce the re-stenosis rate., 75477=FIG. 2B illustrates use of an optional check valve 22 within the stent 10 and positioned in anchor arm 12. Check valves are well known and valve 22 permits flow only in the direction of arrow A (i.e., from open end 12a to open ends 14a, 16a) while blocking reverse flow. Valve 22 is used to prevent the back-flow of blood from the coronary artery to the heart chamber. Valves sufficiently small to fit into arm 20 are within the skill of the art. For example, Wanpen Vongpatanasin et. al, Prosthetic Heart Valves, 335(6) N.E.J.M. 407-416 (Aug. 8, 1996) describes valves of 24 square millimeters., 88170=Prior to bypass surgery, an initial approximation of the required cross-sectional outer diameter of the intracoronary arms 14, 14', 16 of the apparatus 10, 10' of the present invention can be gained by standard radiographic techniques. Also, prior to bypass surgery, the appropriate opening pressure of a check valve 22, 22' of the apparatus 10, 10' of the present invention can be determined by the dynamic measurements of coronary artery pressure, blood flow, and heart chamber pressures through selective catheterization with standard techniques. See Minoru Hongo et al., 127 (3) AM. HEART J. 545-51 (March 1994)., 100219=Second, cardiopulmonary bypass is initiated by a variety of standard techniques as outlined by George Silvay et al., Cardiopulmonary Bypass for Adult patients: A Survey of Equipment and Techniques, 9(4) J. CARDIOTHORAC. VASC. ANESTH. 420-24 (Aug. 20, 1995).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes Although the foregoing invention has been described in detail by way of illustration and example, for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be obvious that changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims. Changes and Modifications Twenty-first, anesthesia is reversed and the patient revived by standard techniques. Twentieth, the sites of the innominate incision 142 and femoral incision 126 are surgically re-approximated through standard closure techniques. Nineteenth, the intracoronary catheter 120 is withdrawn from the body through the femoral incision site 126. Eighteenth, the third intraventricular catheter 70 is withdrawn from the body through the innominate incision site 142. Seventeenth, angiographic dye can be introduced into a chamber of the heart through a port internal to the third intraventricular catheter 71. The introduction of angiographic dye can allow the blood flow to be visualized under fluoroscopy, digital subtraction angiography, or similar standard techniques. By such radiographic examination, blood flow directly from a chamber of a heart into a coronary artery can be ascertained. In cases where a check valve 74 is utilized, the uni-directional flow from a chamber of a heart and into a coronary artery, in the direction of arrow C, can be verified. Sixteenth, the balloon 130 on the end of the intracoronary catheter 120 is deflated. The hollow tube 71 can, but may not necessarily, be equipped with a one-way check valve 74 to limit blood",
