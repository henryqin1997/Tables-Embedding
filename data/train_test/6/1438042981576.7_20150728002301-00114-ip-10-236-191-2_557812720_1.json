The Stoke City midfielder has endured a tough four years at the Britannia Stadium, making just five starts in eighteen appearances. Tonge is in the final year of his contract with Stoke and he believes it is an ideal opportunity to prove himself. Speaking on Yorkshire Radio, Tonge said, \"It is an ideal opportunity to try and prove myself and that I can still play at this level. \"I am confident that I can and I would love to get something permanent sorted, whether it is here, hopefully I can do well enough to prove it. I just need to get playing and enjoying football again.\" Tonge has had loan spells at Preston - twice, Derby County and Barnsley since joining Stoke. Last season he spent the final three months with Barnsley making ten appearances. The 29 year old is no stranger to Leeds boss Neil Warnock having come through the ranks at Sheffield United and being given his debut by Warnock at 18. Tonge made over 300 appearances for Sheffield United before moving to Stoke on transfer deadline day 2008 for a deal worth \u00a32,000,000. He is likely to go straight into the squad today for the trip to Cardiff City and he will be vying for a starting place with Michael Brown, as Warnock will be without the injured David Norris.
