The 6 song track listing was a holdover from The Time's original format. This is an interesting, yet non-essential MPLS time capsule. For fans of Prince, the Time, the 80's or MPLS funk, \"Oak Tree\" is an essential jam, \"Love Sign\" is a joyous funky jam, and \"Love/Addiction\" is a light-hearted pop jam. Tracks 1 & 2 are more-or-less about Day's personna and track 5 is a slow jam about a guy who is not interested in commitment. All-in-all, go for 3, 4 & 6, maybe 1, and if you have to have it all, the rest.}",

    "textAfterTable": "6 Songs Album Review After the temporary collapse of the Time, Morris Day went into the recording studio for his first solo excursion. While the trademarked Minneapolis pop-funk sound still remains at the forefront of each composition, the absence of the magic is extremely noticeable in the production booth. That aside, The Color of Success offers to fans what Day does best, funky but accessible dance-pop music in the vein of many of his Minneapolis contemporaries. While the album runs a little bit on the short side, there is no filler and it is surprisingly consistent from start to finish. Fans of Day's work with the Time will enjoy this record, but first-time listeners would be better-served checking out his earlier work first.
