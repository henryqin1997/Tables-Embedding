            "Anyone who wants to be more serious about getting a quality education. There are tutoring programs, along with a writing center for students who need to get their paper's reviewed. In the writing center, they also help you brainstorm your essay topic.",
            "If you do decide to come to Widener, join a club or two. Stay active on campus in extracurricular activities. Also get a planner, you will need to have good time management or you will be a mess.",
            "I believe that for the small class sizes, how friendly most people on campus are, most teachers will tell you to get your priorities straight if you are doing not too well in a class, it is the best bang for the buck.",
            "Students are friendly and bubbly. There are tons of things to do on campus, such as the rock climbing wall, billiard tables, lounges, and various clubs.",
            "Since Widener is a private school, the classes are generally small. The largest amount of students I have been in a class with is probably fifteen students. This means the professors are able to focus more on students and help them with topics they are having trouble with. Widener also offers tutoring programs for students."

Both options have a wide variety of food to choose from and I like it all. Although I am not a picky eater, I know my friends who are always find something good to eat., 130328=A new garden was donated in the fall of 2012 by a alumni of the class of 1967 and in that garden there is a metal dome that incoming freshman will walk through and walk through again during graduation., 1078=Take advantage of as many Widener days as you can, even schedule a daily tour with the Admissions Office at Mueller Hall. Our average tuition is around $30,000 a year, but the school does offer many scholarships to help out the students. We have a great faculty, (75%+ possess a doctorate in their particular field). And we also have a student to teacher ratio of 12:1 meaning small class sizes. We have a large campus with plenty to do on weekends, along with nationally recognized varsity athletic teams and various club sports and student life organizations.}",
