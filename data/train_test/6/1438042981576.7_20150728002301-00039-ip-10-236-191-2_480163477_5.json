    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{29679=FIG. 1 shows schematically a portion of a GSM cellular radio system. In the cellular radio system, the area covered by the system is divided into radio cells. Base station controllers BSC1 and BSC2 are connected by digital transmission links 12 to a mobile exchange MSC. Furthermore, base stations BTS1, BTS2 and BTS3, BTS4 are connected by digital transmission links 11 to the base station controllers BSC1 and BSC2, respectively. Each BSC and the base stations BTS controlled by it form a base station system BSS. The radio coverage area of a single base station BTS typically creates a single radio cell. Each base station BTS1 to BTS4 has a predetermined fixed number of physical radio channels. The configuration and properties of the GSM system are described in more detail in the GSM specifications and in the book \"The GSM System for Mobile Communications, M. Mouly & M. B. Pautet, Palaiseau, France, 1992, ISBN:2-9507190-0-7, which are hereby incorporated by reference., 38980=In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the above mentioned problem is solved by utilizing the bits 5 to 8 of the octet 6 in the TMSI to differentiate between different TMSI's of different systems. According to the invention, these bits are coded in all mobile radio systems in an uniform manner to indicate the mobile radio system which has allocated the TMSI. The remaining bit locations of the TMSI may be used in a mobile radio system-specific format. For example, if these bits are coded as \"1111\" for identifying the TMSIs of GSM900/DCS1800 systems, as shown in FIG. 4. All other codings of the bits 5 to 8 in the octet 6 may be used to identify TMSIs of other mobile radio systems, as shown by \"xxxx\" in FIG. 5., 29208=The present invention is applicable to all mobile radio systems utilizing subscriber identity modules SIMs or the like. The present invention is particularly advantaged when applied in the pan-European digital mobile radio system GSM or in the modification thereof, DCS1800. In the following, the preferred embodiment of the invention will be described as an application in a GSM system, to which the invention, however, is not intended to be limited., 20413=Also, other mobile radio systems in addition to GSM may use the same kind of smart card for similar purposes, thus enabling user specific information to roam between different mobile radio systems independently of the air interface specifications. For example, in the U.S.A. the so called Personal Communications Systems (PCS) are being developed having several different air interfaces. Also, in Europe, DCS 1800, which is a mobile radio system realized according to GSM specifications, expect different radio interface (carrier frequencies of approximately 1800 MHz instead of that of approximately 900 MHz in GSM system) utilizes SIM cards. The smart card may be the only common nominator between these systems to provide \"SIM roaming\" between systems. It is desirable to have the same smart card in different systems, because the user does not have to change his/her user profile when the terminal and/or air interface needs to be changed.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The figures and the description associated are only intended to illustrate the present invention. Changes and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without going beyond the scope and spirit of the attached claims. Referring now to the flow chart of FIG. 7, the VLR receives a location attempt from a new MS2 in one of its location areas. Also, the old TMSI allocated to the mobile subscriber in the mobile radio system I is received at the VLR2 at step 71. Then the VLR2 analyses bits 5 to 8 of octet 6 in the TMSI, in steps 72 and 73, in order to find out the actual structure of the old TMSI and the mobile radio system that allocated the old TMSI. If the decision in the step 73 is that the old TMSI is allocated by the same mobile radio system, namely system II, VLR2 makes a standard IMSI request in mobile radio system II, unless the old TMSI is already known by the VLR2, in step 74. In the present example, the VLR2 detects that the bits 5 to 8 of octet 6 in the TMSI are coded as \"1111\", and the decision that the old TMSI belongs to the mobile radio system I is made in step 73. As a consequence, the VLR2 requests the actual user identity, IMSI, from the VLR1 of the mobile radio system I because the VLR1 is",
