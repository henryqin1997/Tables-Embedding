            "Saint Leo is great for students who are afraid to be just a number or a face in the crowd. I personally need the one on one attention with teachers because a Biology major is so crucial to detail. It's also great if you want to know everyone on campus.",
            "There is a bus that takes you to Wiregrass Outlets once a month and there are plenty of activites to do on campus as well! They are all student oriented so people can interact with others and get out as well and have fun in a safe environment.",
            "I love the cafeteria! There are so many different options for food. You can have whatever you want whenever, food is healthy, and they also have a wide enough variety, that you can please your sweet tooth if needed.",
            "The worst part about dorm life is that when you're a freshman, your dorms aren't as nice. You have community style bathrooms, which is a downfall to me. On the plus side, you are considered an upper classman by your sophomore year, and then you get to live in much nicer dorms.",
            "Being a Biology major, I am in one of the most rigorous majors there is. Based on my experience, Saint Leo works hard to help students get the best education they can. I start my classes a week before everyone to study strictly Biology that entire week, and get a better understanding of what my major consists of. Saint Leo definitely has my best interest in mind.",
            "Be sure you are willing to go to a campus with not many students. Everyone will know you. You also have to be dedicated to your studies and attend classes, because your teacher will notice if you're not there.",
            "Saint Leo is a beautiful, quaint campus located in Saint Leo, Florida. The buildings are nice and the scenery is even nicer. Everyone knows everyone and interaction among students never goes unencouraged, what with different social events, intramurals, and different student organizations."

I will begin on April 29th., 490375=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 207464=I have been enrolled at Saint Leo (Adult Center, Georgia) since March 2012 and can't express how much I've appreciated the professionalism of the instructors. As a non-traditional student I was apprehensive about returning to school. I haven't regretted my decision!, 89042=campus was founded in 1889., 149561=Staff has been very helpful in transitioning from my community college. Financial aid representative is easy to work with and informative. Look forward to starting my first semester Fall 2012., 147549=I will be attending Saint Leo in the fall of 2012 as a freshman., 412024=As a commuter, a meal plan is not required. That being said, I have gone into the main dining area a few times. The food is great; it is buffet style. The only draw back for commuters and the main dining area is the price, $10 as of 2013. The Lion's Lair is more reasonable on price but it is not a buffet and there are limited options. However, it offers grilled items, deli items, snacks, drinks, and items needed for your dorm if you live on campus.}",
