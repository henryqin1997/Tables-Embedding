A quiet start to the game saw both sides scoreless for the first twenty minutes, errors and penalties punctuating a reasonably lifeless opening quarter. The Titans nearly scored the first try through returning centre Beau Champion (a knock on was ruled against them by the Video Referee), before the Bulldogs replied at the other end with a try to Ben Barba after 24 minutes on the back of a great Dene Halatau bust. The Bulldogs held the Titans out until the halftime break, with Scott Prince reaping the rewards of an early return from injury, scoring just before the siren to get his side on the board. A confusing conversion attempt ended up being taken by Aidan Sezer, who missed. The Bulldogs kept a 6-4 lead at oranges. It would be the Titans who came out stronger in the second half, with a lack of discipline costing the Bulldogs dearly. Repeated penalties and drop-balls gave the Titans far too much leeway and by the 58 minute mark a couple of tries put them 20-6 in front... the dreaded fourteen point margin by which they led with twenty left last week before losing 15-14. Funnily enough, the Bulldogs managed back to back tries through Barba and Josh Morris to put a scare through the Gold Coast ranks, a clearly frustrated John Cartwright ordering more steely defence from his troops. It worked, and late penalty goals for Aidan Sezer following Prince's departure with a hamstring injury, combined with a field-goal on fulltime, put the result beyond any doubt. Injury concerns for both sides come out of this one - David Stagg's knee bent awkwardly and he went up the tunnel in the second half, while Scott Prince's hamstring continue to be of issue for the 2011 wooden spooners, who have now won their third match of the 2012 season. Next week the Titans enjoy the comfort of the bye, while the Bulldogs will host the Sharks in Monday night footy at ANZ Stadium - both sides to be without players selected for State of Origin the following Wednesday night., 33634=Match Details Canterbury Bulldogs 14 were defeated by Gold Coast Titans 25 National Rugby League - Round 10 - Friday May 11, 2012 8:45pm Venue: Suncorp Stadium Referees: Jared Maxwell and Brett Suttor Video Referee: Pat Reynolds Touch Judges: Michael Wise and Chris Butler Crowd: 41,273 (Double Header) Halftime: Canterbury Bulldogs 6 Gold Coast Titans 4}",
