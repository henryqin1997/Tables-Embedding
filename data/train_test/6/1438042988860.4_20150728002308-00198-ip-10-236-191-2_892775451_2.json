Some Haskell libraries, like the containers library, could use some benchmarks (using e.g. Criterion) and hopefully some performance improvements., 9358=The Darcs Patch Manager (DPM for short) is a tool that simplifies working with darcs. It is most effective when used in an environment where developers do not push their patches directly to the main repository but where patches undergo a reviewing process before they are actually applied. See http://www.factisresearch.com/2010/03/dpm/ for a short tutorial.}",

It contains categorical functors which support the identity functor and functor composition without needing newtype wrappers. 2.25 Data.Category Hackers: Gero Kriependorf, Dirk Sp\u00f6ri, Johannes Weiss, A library for sending emails via SMTP or `sendmail`. In the future the email library should be extended to include parsing and generating of emails, reading mboxes and maildirs or connecting to IMAP and POP servers. 2.24 Email Hackers: Don Time to release the Haskell Platform 2.23 Haskell Platform Hackers: Benedikt Huber, David Markvica The Haskell Objective C-Bridge (HOC) currently does not work out-of-the box on latest ghc/cabal. We want to fix this, work on cabal support for building Objective C modules, and eventually see if it is possible to get HOC on hackage. 2.22 HOC Hackers: David Anderson Since the aim is partially to dispel the myth that Haskell can't be used for I/O heavy real world code, help on improving the performance of the code is most welcome. The code is still under heavy construction. The goal for the hackathon is to",
