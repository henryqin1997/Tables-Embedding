I am a part of their Education program and it is a very well organized program and the professors in it are very helpful and love what they are doing which makes class quite enjoyable. I recommend it for Education majors. Tips for prospective students Have fun. Get involved. You will get the most of your college experience by getting involved with clubs, organizations and even a job on campus. Take time from school to relax and enjoy yourself. Not only will you have fun but it will help you with school by controlling your stress. Don't be afraid to ask questions, either in class or outside of class. That's what professors are here for. Bang for the buck",
