Das, \"Ferroelectrics for Time Delay Steering of an Array,\" Ferroelectrics, vol. 5, pp. 253-257, 1973. The present invention uses low loss ferroelectrics as discused by Rytz et al. D Rytz, M. B. Klein, B. Bobbs, M. Matloubian and H. Fetterman, Dielectric Properties of KTa1-x Nbx O3 at millimeter wavelengths,\" J. Appl. Phys. vol. 24 (1985), Supp. 24-2, pp. 1010-1012, and to reduce the conductor losses, uses a high Tc superconductor for the conductor. (2) The properties of ferroelectrics are temperature dependent as discussed by Rytz et al. supra. This invention uses the phase shifters at a constant high Tc superconducting temperature. (3) The third deficiency is the variation of the VSWR over the operating range of the phase shifter. The present invention uses a ferroelectric quarter wave matching transformer to obtain a good VSWR over the operating range of the phase shifter. The bandwidth of the phase shifter can be extended by using more than one matching transformer.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It should be understood that the foregoing disclosure relates to only typical embodiments of the invention and that numerous modification or alternatives may be made therein by those skilled in art without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. Specifically, the invention contemplates various dielectrics, ferroelectrics, ferroelectric liquid crystals (FLCs), high Tc superconducting materials impedances of microstrip lines, and operating frequencies of the phase shifter. The conductors and the conductive depositions are made of conductive materials and of a film of a single crystal high Tc superconductor material including YBCO. The embodiments shown in FIGS. 1, 2 and 3 are discrete devices as well as a part of a monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMIC). The phase shifter is operated at the high Tc superconducting Tc currently between 77 and 105 degrees K. and increasing. The bias voltage V is applied through an LC filter. In FIG. 3 is shown another embodiment of this invention. The ferroelectric material 38 has its top 31 and bottom 34 surfaces deposited with conductors. The input quarter wavelength transformer ferroelectric material is 56 whose top 52 and bottom 54 surfaces are deposited with conductors. Compared to the phase shifter microstrip line, the quarter wavelength transformer has a smaller width and a larger height. The output quarter wavelength ferroelectric material is 57 whose top 53 and bottom 55 surfaces are deposited with",
