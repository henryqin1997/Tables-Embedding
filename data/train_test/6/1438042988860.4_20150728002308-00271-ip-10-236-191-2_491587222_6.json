The CSR-1516 is part of their Sporting Rifle line, which offers a lot of nice features at a relatively low price. While still filling the role of a competitive rifle very well, it is a bit lighter and handier than the CRP-18 previously reviewed, weighing in at only six pounds, seven ounces on my scale, and while it also sells at a lower price by eliminating some of the features of the CRP-18, such as the adjustable gas port and stainless, fluted barrel, it is still a fine, hand-built weapon. The overall length of the CSR-1516 measures between thirty-two and one-half to thirty-five and three-quarters inches, depending upon the position of the buttstock. The CSR-1516 wears a sixteen-inch 4140 chrome-molybdenum air-gauged barrel with a one-in-eight-inch rifling twist. The hand guard is an aluminum free-floating unit that measures twelve inches in length, with a diameter of 1.974 inches. The hand guard wears a three-inch section of Picatinny rail at the top, forward end. The hand guard is drilled to accept additional sections of rail, if desired. The gas block is a Bold Ideas low-profile machined steel unit, and is set at the carbine-length position of the barrel on this direct-impingement gas system rifle. The muzzle is fitted with a closed-bottom flash suppressor. The forged receiver has no forward assist mechanism, nor does it have an ejection port dust cover.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "A few months ago I did a review of the Colt Competition CRP-18 rifle that is purpose-built for competition, particularly the fast-growing sport of 3-Gun Shooting. Bold Ideas of Texas is the company that builds the Colt Competition rifles. They are, to my way of thinking, the equivalent of what the Colt Custom Shop does for handguns, but with rifles. Bold Ideas focuses on building precision rifles for competition. However, the excellent features that make a rifle ideal for 3-Gun competition also makes it very useful as a fighting rifle or a hunting rifle, and they have greatly expanded their line of Colt Competition rifles since I hammered out that last review.

    "textAfterTable": "As is obvious from the chart above, this is a very accurate rifle. Building this rifle, Colt Competition did not sacrifice quality nor accuracy, they just eliminated a few features of their more-expensive weapons to produce this very affordable version of their excellent rifle. I was really pleasantly surprised at the accuracy of the 55 grain Stryker ammunition from this rifle. It uses the excellent Hornady V-Max bullet, but the ammo sells for a lot less than most match-grade ammo, yet it yielded match-grade performance. The Colt Competition/Leupold scope performed very well, enabling me to achieve fine accuracy from this rifle. The VX-R scope has a push-button for the illuminated dot in the center of the reticle for use in low-light situations.
