Waist: To measure your natural waistline, wrap the tape so it intersects your navel. Keep tape flat, but comfortably loose. Hips: Stand with your heels together and measure the fullest part of your hips. Make sure the measuring tape is level all the way around your body. Inseam: Stand up straight, and start the tape measure high in your crotch. Straighten the tape down the inside of your leg to the bottom of your ankle.",
