Since the standard laptops have less resolution that 1080 you may as well convert the video down into something you computer can display. I used the prism video converter to change a video from 1080 P at 60 frames per second down to 540 P at 60 frames per second it plays fine. Sony's 1080 P movies are an MTS file. Prism does not let you convert to an MTS file but gives you several options MOV MP4 AVI MPG and others. I'm experimenting now to find the best format.}",
