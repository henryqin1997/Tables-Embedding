    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing descriptions of specific embodiments of the present invention have been presented for purposes of illustration and description. They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed, and it should be understood that many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical application, to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. It is intended that the scope of the invention be defined by the Claims appended hereto and their equivalents. As should be apparent, the present invention provides (1) transformation of digital data prior to the storage in discrete analog media to improve system total signal to noise ratio; (2) exact measurement of processing noise prior to actual storage of the data; and (3) optimization of ECC to the exact processing noise. In the particular example, it is assumed that there is no storage noise thus the same data exactly may be read from the memory. The 32 point complex vector is now going through the FFT process and results in the Output column (column 3). This output is compared to the scaled by 32 input (column 4), to allow the comparison to the input signal;",
