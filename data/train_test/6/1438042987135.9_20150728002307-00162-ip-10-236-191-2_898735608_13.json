            "There are security guards and policemen everywhere. Its an extremely safe campus with great people who watch out for you! I have lost my wallet twice and had it returned to me by the student life office (a janitor has returned it there). It was the same case for my portfolio, which contained important documents. I was beyond amazed to have gotten them back but Baruch is a very trusting environment.",
            "The sororities are pretty non-existent; however, I have heard from male friends that the initiation for frats are difficult...",
            "There are over 100 clubs at Baruch - I'm confident there is a club here to meet your needs. They have a complete list at http://baruch.cuny.edu.",
            "If you're prepared to get up early for morning classes with enough time to commute to the city, Baruch is definitely for you! If you appreciate diversity, Baruch is the most culturally diverse campus in the nation!",
            "A lot of people sit by Bernard M. Baruch's status as a rite of pasage, although its nothing special. The space right outside the vertical campus is a great place to catch up with friends in between classes, only when the weather agrees, so be careful!",
            "For cheap coffee, there is a cart by 24th Street (at the c\u00c3?\u00c2?\u00c3?\u00c2?\u00c3?\u00c2?\u00c3?\u00c2\u00b3rner) and it sells hot coffee for a dollar! Avoid getting Starbucks daily, it wastes way too much money. There is a pizza place that has relatively good dollar pizza around the gramercy area right next to starbucks (on 24th street). They don't accept cards though so make sure to carry extra cash with you at all times.",
            "If you think you deserve a treat, maybe after getting that first A in Eng 2150 or acing the philosophy midterm, you should head over to the student life office on the third floor to get some discount tickets! Broadway plays in Times Square or hop by the theatre on 23rd. Retail therapy is available in Union Square or by Penn Station (34th & Lexington).",
            "The sushi at school is amazing! There are sushi chefs inside the cafeteria who make it fresh at all times of the day. I'd recommend the spicy salmon roll as it is not too heavy, with some spicy mayo sauce of course! It costs about 8 dollars for an 8-piece sushi combo. The pizza is good, nothing to rave about, although cheap ($3) but if you get a topping of mushrooms and season it like crazy, with oregano, red peppers, garlic and cheddar, it should taste just fine! The salads are a pretty popular option; sometimes all people get to contain their hunger and save money by buying a cube of cheese with grapes (it really does work!). The chicken tenders and fries honestly are not something I would eat again.",
            "The dorms are extremely spacious (but expensive). I would caution against going too crazy and just make sure to maintain a clean, personal space. Everyone helps out in the kitchen so its awesome. Have your mother/father or some other close relative send you packages full of goodies every month at least! Learn to cook :)",
            "So far, as a freshman, the classes I'm taking are mostly prerequisites. For psychology, I have an amazing professor so as long as I pay attention in that class, I am on track to getting an A. As for my other courses, it definitely depends on the teacher. I know calculus is not going too well for my math class as a result of the professor's policies. Most of the professors' policies are listed in the syllabus so have a copy with you handy (either online or a hard-copy). The classes are not hard as long as you take notes in class and keep up with your homework, don't procrastinate for tests, etc. It is okay to do that in the beginning of the semester, but from there, it only gets harder, so that would not be a wise idea. Register for the right classes at the right time!",
            "I would suggest that you definitely keep in touch with your professors. That is helpful for especially large classes in which it may seem like you are just a number. Also, keeping up with homework assignments online or through blackboard is a must. Attendance is rigorously taken so make sure you are in class and on time or else you are possibly risking a failing grade. Make sure you catch an express train at the earliest possible time! Being a commuter school does not make Baruch any less of a college. There is a lot of sightseeing as it occupies a prime location. The library is a wonderful spot to study solo or with friends. I have collaborated with many classmates to complete homework assignments and the job is done much faster. Make sure to carry extra cash with you at all times. There are ATMs for both TD Bank and Chase Bank on 21st Street and Park Ave South. Union Square is not very far from school (a few blocks away) and it has amazing restaurants, shopping, spa services, you name it! Get your discount tickets from the student life office on the third floor. Do not ever leave assignments to the last minute (this doesn't work in college!) and you will end up being late to your first class. If you're commuting a long way and will be doing so for the entire year, make sure to invest in an unlimited metro-card. Its worth it! E-mail your professors for any problems with classes. Drop classes on time (when you will not be charged extra money or a W on the final transcript).",
            "Although Baruch College is a commuter school, the New York City setting undoubtedly makes up for it. There are a multitude of activities that go on around campus that interested students should look into for themselves. Most of the professors are extremely understanding if you approach them directly."

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Tips for prospective students Don't hold your breath for information from Baruch if you are also considering other schools. You will be forced to wait. If you are transferring right out of high school it might not be so bad as you know you will start at Baruch from scratch. If you are transferring credits, it will take an act of congress to find out which ones will transfer-- at least in the time you need to know if you are considering other schools. Very disappointed. Bang for the buck I have been accepted and was planning on transferring. As an out of state student, I needed to know certain information before I could move to New York and attend. The most important information I needed was what credits would transfer from my school to Baruch. Baruch would not provide me with this information and said I had to show up in person, 2 weeks before classes start, to receive it. As a business school is concerned, I found this very unprofessional and disappointing. I could not risk moving to New York before knowing if only some or all of my credits would transfer. Additionally I was on deadlines with my back up schools and would risk being left out of college completely if, hypothetically, I waited for Baruch and found out that",
