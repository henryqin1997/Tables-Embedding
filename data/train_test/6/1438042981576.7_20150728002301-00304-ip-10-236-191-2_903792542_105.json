            "Campus safety here is excellent. Milwaukee can be a scary city from the outside but with BOSS and campus police I feel totally safe.",
            "There are SO many different clubs and activities on campus happening at all times. There's always something to do!",
            "Well-rounded students with the ability and fortitude to fend for themselves. UWM is for students who like to guide themselves. Advisers help and professors help but it's always up to the student in the end.",
            "UWM, for the education you get and the connections (particularly through the business school/fraternities), is an excellent option. I think it is affordable and I work two jobs and take out FAFSA loans to pay for it.",
            "Milwaukee has some of the best restaurants in the US and the food in Sandberg Dorms isn't so bad either. Definitely a lot of great food stops out here though that can be found on North, Water, and in the Third Ward. Milwaukee has a great mix of cultures so restaurants are always great to check out.",
            "I was in the dorms for 1 year and they are pretty great. Once you move out you realize that you have to cook for yourself, pay for your own heat, etc. It's not the easiest but I liked the dorms and would do it again if I could.",
            "UWM is for students with a great work ethic. Anyone who isn't doing what they should be doing will eventually find themselves leaving but that being said with the right amount of effort you can go very far.",
            "Make sure going to school is the right option for you. Keep and open mind and listen to your advisers and professors.",
            "I think the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee with it's involvement in Milwaukee and it's open mindedness towards innovation and moving forward, is the best option for me. I also believe the guidance here is relative to real world experiences because as a student you are not coddled you are and adult and you're treated like one."

Oriental Theater, Miramar Theater for good music and movies., 229674=Looking for fun things to do in Milwaukee is hardly ever an issue. The Miramar on Oakland ave is a great venue for bands and electronic music Wednesday - Saturday of most every week (the only downside about the venue being a small cover charge). For those who are 21 or older, there are many bars and clubs surrounding the area to have fun, dance, and meet new and interesting people. During the warmer months bike riding, rollerblading, running, or playing volleyball is quite popular around the beaches on Lincoln Memorial Drive., 20213=Apply for as many scholarships as possible for school. Whether it is $100, or $1000, every little bit helps. Also, be sure to get your information and everything sent in by the deadlines so that you are not feeling like you are behind everyone else., 40126=I would suggest that anyone looking to pursue a dance degree should take dance classes from a local studio for a few years before attending the required audition. It was very obvious that the professors conducting the audition were looking for prospective students with previous dance training. Scholarships were awarded at the first three auditions held in October, February, and April. The last audition was held in June and students were still admitted to the program but scholarship money had already been used up., 761151=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 348388=Every October there is a Zombie Apocalypse where there are students dressed up as zombies, and you must cross the campus without being bitten., 163393=We have so many clubs and activities that I wouldn't even be able to count! If you can think of something we most likely have it! I, on the other hand, found an organization that we did not have, Autism Speaks. Once I found out we did not have an organization here, I started looking into starting it. I am now currently getting the chapter started for the Fall 2012 semester!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students -Do not put off orientation until the last minute. It's when you schedule your classes and you do not want to get stuck with the last picks. -Always rent your course books when you have the option. -Don't get caught up in the fun. Professors don't care if you don't do your homework, but it seriously hurts your grade. You need at least a C to pass a class here, so don't slack off. -Show up to class. Seriously, you will be so lost if you don't. This isn't high school where you get the homework the next day. And make sure you show up ON TIME. Some of my professors will count tardies as absences. If you have too many absences, it will knock points off your grades. -Sit in the first few rows of the lecture hall. It sounds dorky, but it helps you pay attention. -Actually pay attention in your lectures. Some of your professors will not be from America, meaning they have thick accents. If you don't pay attention, you will get lost. -Take good notes. -Join student organizations. -Don't write people off before you get to know them. Bang for the buck I am only paying the tuition rate, which is somewhere around $8,000. When you pay your student fee, which I think is $200, you get a UPASS. This allows Milwaukee",
