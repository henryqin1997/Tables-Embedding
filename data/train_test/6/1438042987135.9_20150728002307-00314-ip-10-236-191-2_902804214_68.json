            "U of Iowa is an institution that invites young minds to grow and develop with the help of highly educated leaders. Family values are important within the administration and add value as to the environment within the grounds of the University. Service is important also and enhances the experience here whether it be threw Religious Institutions , Athletics, Arts, or any other types of curriculum. Respectfully Eric Flood"

From football games to Kinnick stadium to theater performances at Hancher auditorium, there is always something for students to do in their free time. The university sponsors many events every week that students may attend free of charge, which is wonderful because everyone knows that college students are not swimming in cash. For example, during Homecoming 2008, the University of Iowa brought in the band Rooney and Chuck Berry to play after the pep rally. Being able to see the old and the new of music for free before a major football game was an amazing experience, and I expect the University of Iowa to continue exciting events such as this in the future., 775443=The flood of 2008 did some damage to the Iowa Memorial Union, but it will be fully restored in 2015 with even more dining options and study spaces for students! Other dining options are available in the dorm halls. It's a little spendy (to be expected with on-campus dining), but the food is good and there are lots of options., 488904=I opted not to go to the dorms because I've heard there's a lot of drama/partying and also being packed like sardines doesn't really sound that appealing to me. Also, the Mayflower dorm floods everytime we have high water - so 1994, 2008 and 2013. Would not recommend living in that dorm - ever.}",

Am learning a lot The faculty at the University of Iowa are extremely intent on their students learning excellent material that they will later apply to their future career. Despite the university being a large school in the Big Ten, the professors and teacher assistants are extremely driven to making sure you know what is going on in the class. Many professors hold office hours multiple times per week, which is great considering the fact that it may be difficult to ask questions in lectures that more than",
