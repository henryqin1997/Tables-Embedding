But the results were encouraging enough that manager John Farrell plans to stick with the platoon in 2014. Look no further than what the World Series-champion Red Sox got out of left field last season by pairing Jonny Gomes and Daniel Nava: 18 home runs, 37 doubles, 101 RBIs. Boston's .790 OPS out of left field tied for third among Major League teams, trailing only the Rockies (Carlos Gonzalez, when healthy) and Cardinals (Matt Holliday) at that position. Although the word platoon is often unfairly assigned to several of these situations, given that playing time won't always be predicated upon handedness, not having an everyday player prescribed at every position isn't necessarily a shortcoming and could, in fact, emerge as a strength. Last season, according to Elias Sports Bureau, players batted in favorable matchups (right-handed batters against left-handed pitchers, and vice versa) 56 percent of the time, the highest such percentage since 1995 (57) and an indication, perhaps, of the measures teams are taking to eke more efficiency and efficacy out of",
    "textAfterTable": "Courtesy of Elias Sports Bureau Pure production, as you might have noticed from a winter in which three position players (Shin-Soo Choo, Jacoby Ellsbury and Robinson Cano) signed contracts of $130 million or more, can be awfully expensive. That's why such small-market clubs as the A's and Rays have long made a habit of maximizing the potential of their rosters through the use of timeshares. But this winter we're seeing several of the big spenders -- the Tigers, who will pair Rajai Davis with Andy Dirks in left; the Yankees, who are slated to have Kelly Johnson and Eduardo Nunez take over for A-Rod at third; and the Rangers, who are reportedly searching for a right-handed bat to complement Mitch Moreland at designated hitter -- toy with, if not outright embrace, the idea as well. Even the Phillies, who have long shied away from the statistically inclined idea that Ryan Howard (who has a career .224 average against lefties) ought to be benched in unfavorable matchups, are voicing a new-found openness to the idea. Or at least, newly permanent manager Ryne Sandberg is. Sandberg said that Howard will get the opportunity to hit against lefties in Spring Training but hinted that the Phils could take advantage of Kevin Frandsen, Darin Ruf or John Mayberry Jr. in such situations during the season. \"It isn't a concern,\" Sandberg said of Howard's struggles, \"because we can do something about it.\" Advanced data has infiltrated",
