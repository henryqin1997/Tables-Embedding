            "Motivated students who would like to have a more meaningful college experience than a lot of forgotten drunken nights. (Though if that's your thing, it's still easy to do that at American)",
            "Try talking to a few of the students while on campus and asking any questions you might have. The tour guides don't tell lies on the tours, but they are discouraged from discussing a few topics such as the gender imbalance.",
            "I don't think I'll be able to correctly judge this until I have graduated, but so far I think I am more than getting my money's worth. The classroom experience has been good and the speakers that come to campus have been excellent. I feel very fortunate to be where I'm at.",
            "It has been so easy to get involved on campus and even easier to do things off campus. D.C. is the best college town because everything is free. It's hard to complain about being bored when there are free events happening every day in addition to the free museums and free concerts.",
            "American University is by far one of the most under ranked universities in my opinion. The courses I've taken thus far have all been taught by professors that are not only passionate about the subject but have also made major contributions to their field. I am continuously challenged and have begun to look at domestic and world affairs in a new light."

I think it is a good thing because they ensure that the students have the skills necessary to be successful in advanced classes, especially research. I took some college classes in my high school, and most of the classes transferred and were applied towards my degree., 464237=I went to go look at this school in February of 2013 when I was looking at Maryland CP, GWU, and Georgetown. I got on the campus and was immediately unimpressed, the entire campus was grey and drap and the people were less than friendly. Needless to say, I did not apply here., 243934=The dorms can be pretty cramped, especially as the school's popularity grows. But the campus is expanding starting in 2013 to add more dormitories, which will make dorm life more comfortable., 335901=There is one main dining hall - Terrace Dining Hall (better known as TDR) - with the classic stations of salad, grill, pasta/pizza, and wok. In 2013, there should be implemented several other food options, such as Elevation Burger and Starbucks. They will join the ones already on campus such as Einstein Bros. Bagels, Megabytes, Eagle's Nest, and Tavern (got to get the tenders!)., 106669=The capitol is no NYC, but there's rarely a quiet night downtown. There are plenty of clubs and concerts (a popular small venue is The 9:30 club) where well-known bands and DJs come to play. Tuesday nights there are live poetry readings at Busboys and Poets on K street. If you're not one to travel downtown often, there's plenty happening on campus! Sororities have hosted some dance parties in Mary Graydon Center, movies have been shown before they premier in theaters, local metal/alternative bands have played in the basement of the Kay Spiritual Life Center, a zip line was set up down the length of the quad, as well as a petting zoo! The list goes on for miles., 491298=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

I don't know a single person at American that doesn't do at least two extra-curriculars outside of their class load. Tips for prospective students Definitely come visit the campus before making a decision, because that's what sold me on coming here. Especially in the spring you can really see how active students are in and outside the classroom, and how much a college with a campus in a city has to offer. Bang for the buck While the tuition is very high, the quality of things on campus is very good. There are multiple different construction projects going on, but housing is currently a big issue. Many freshman find themselves in triples,",
