An early example of this was showcased when India were 146 for 5 while chasing a mammoth 325 in the 2002 NatWest final. Along with Mohammad Kaif, \u201cYuvi\u201d crafted one of India's most famous ODI victories to cease a spree of nine consecutive finals defeats, flagging the changing tides for Indian cricket. He later played a key role in India's 2003 World Cup run and by 2006; he was already one of the world\u2019s finest in limited overs. He did get Test opportunities - often trading places with Sourav Ganguly, owing to both players' inconsistent displays \u2013 but he failed to replicate his ODI efficacy. Following the 2007 World Cup disappointment, he played a crucial role in India's famous win at the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 in the same year. Six sixes off a Stuart Broad over against England and a blistering 70 off just 30 balls against Australia will be fondly remembered as some of the finest highlights of his career., 34492=Aug 06 2015,, 83347=\u00a9 Copyright NDTV Convergence Limited 2015.

In the Indian T20 league, he was made the icon player of Punjab for the first two years of its edition. He was then bought by the Pune franchise in 2011 and has been representing them since then., 36915=Aug 04 2015,, 27228=Yuvi was diagnosed with an unfortunate, rare germ cancer that kept him out of action for more than a year immediately after the World Cup. However, India\u2019s favourite son staged an inspirational comeback as he recovered in time ahead of the 2012 World Twenty20. Inconsistencies henceforth have meant that he is in and out of the Indian limited overs side. However, in spite of a very average couple of years, Yuvraj Singh was the costliest player in the Indian T20 league season 7 when Bangalore bought him for a staggering Rs 14 crores., 33272=Jul 30 2015,, 38130=Aug 07 2015,, 35700=Aug 02 2015,}",
