Mackowiak and Wiederholdt (2008) present a model in which firms decide what variables to pay attention to, subject to a constraint on information flow. When idiosyncratic conditions are more variable or more important than aggregate conditions, firms in their model pay more attention to idiosyncratic conditions than to aggregate conditions. Their model has the important property that firms react fast and by large amounts to idiosyncratic shocks, but only slowly and by small amounts to nominal shocks. As a result nominal shocks have strong and persistent real effects. Woodford (2008) develops a generalization of the standard, full-information model of state-dependent pricing in which decisions about when to review a firm's existing price must be made on the basis of imprecise awareness of current market conditions. He endogenizes imperfect information using a variant of the theory of \" rational inattention\" proposed by Sims (1998, 2003)). In related work, Mankiw and Reis (2002) and Reis (2006) stress the potential importance of slow dissemination of information to firms for generating persistent effects of nominal shocks., 363084=Christiano, Lawrence J., and Terry Fitzgerald, 2003, 'The Band Pass Filter,' International Economic Review 44(2), 435-465., 82208=With the exception of the price of investment and of monetary transactions balances, all data were taken from the FRED Database available through the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.21 The price of investment corresponds to the 'total investment' series constructed and used in Fisher (2006).22 Our measure of transactions balances, was obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis's online database.

That firm-specific capital can rationalize a lower estimate of (more frequent price re-optimization) was first demonstrated by Sbordone (1998, 2002) and further discussed by Gali, Gertler and Lopez-Salido (2001) and Woodford (2003). In these papers, the stock of capital owned by the firm is fixed. Woodford (2005) analyzes the impact of firm specific capital allowing for investment. As our discussion above indicates, whether firm specific capital actually does rationalize a lower estimate of depends critically on the other parameters characterizing firms' environments. To the extent that capital utilization rates can easily be varied, the assumption of firm specific capital loses its ability to rationalize low values of A maintained assumption of the papers just cited is that firms cannot vary capital utilization rates. So these papers leave open the question of how important firm specific capital is once firms can vary capital utilization rates. Similarly, the smaller is the elasticity of demand for a firm's output, the smaller is the impact of firm specific capital on inference about The above cited papers condition their inference on particular assumed values for this elasticity. The key contribution of this paper is to estimate the key parameters governing the operational importance of firm specific capital and to assess the importance for firm specific capital in an estimated dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. Our key result is that the assumption of firm specific capital does in fact rationalize relatively low values of thereby helping to reconcile the apparent conflicting pictures of pricing behavior painted by micro and macro data.17, 366036=Golosov, Michael., and Robert E.
