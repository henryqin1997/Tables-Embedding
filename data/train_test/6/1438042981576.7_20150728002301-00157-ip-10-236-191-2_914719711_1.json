            "Great for these types if: - you like small classes - individual attention - if you are going into a health professions major(PT,OT,SLP,and Nursing) or into Education....These are what our school is known for. If you are: -Friendly -Hardworking -Dedicated -Willing to help others in need",
            "GET INVOLOVED!!!! Not only is it a good way to make lifelong friends, it will also make an easier transition for you from High School to College, no matter where you end up. DON'T SPREAD YOURSELF TO THIN!!! When all of the clubs are at the club fair, don't go signing up for everything. Read the papers first , because some clubs have conflicting times. Only sign up for the clubs that you really want to be in. I know you have probably heard this a thousand times before but...TIME MANAGEMENT IS KEY... when you are at school you have your own schedule and all the time in the world. Use it wisely.",
            "MU is really good at giving financial aid out, they are very generous. The better your GPA is in High School the more money you will receive. The also have a service based scholarship so the more community service that you do there is a chance that you could get money too.",
            "I love it at MU but it can be slow on the weekends, so you have plenty of time to do homework, as well as hang with friends.",
            "The Student/Faculty ratio is very good, if you like to have smaller classes. The Professors are always willing to help you inside as well as outside the classrooms or labs."
