Then you could do worse than journey into darkest Essex on July 15th ( a Tuesday by the way) to see Fulham take on Southend United. It`s a fixture that has the Southend manager, drooling over the prospect remarking, 'Fulham will offer us a good test for the coming season.\" 'Pre-season is all about getting the fitness levels right, but it's nice to play against some of the top-flight sides.' If anyone decides to go, I`ll have some of that chocolate covered nougat you can buy from the 'Sea Shell` snack place opposite the hill lift!
