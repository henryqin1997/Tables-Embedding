To this end, there is also a great deal of resources that are available to assist with skill strengthening. Also, be prepared to take at least 3 courses in English, regardless of your major or ultimate study plan--it's a core requirement as of Fall 2013., 239339=The best benefit to a Northeastern education is the co-op program, by far. Take advantage of all of Boston's numerous employment opportunities, mingle with the Ivy kids around the corner, and feel secure in knowing that you've got the experience that counts in the job field. The biggest complaint? Particularly for people who value the small-campus experience, the undergrad class size is a little large for all of your teachers to know you by name. Still, the 14:1 student-teacher ratio is better than what you'd find elsewhere, by far., 690362=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 623930=In October we do an Underwear Run where anyone who wants to can strip down to just their underwear and run down the middle of Massachusetts Avenue and the Prudential Center. The school sanctions it, and it is a BLAST!!, 598842=We hold a naked marathon every year in October. The terrace at the Curry Student Center in the spring time is absolutely gorgeous., 103553=I love Northeastern, I have made so many friends since September and I did not know one person when I arrived. I love the city of Boston, and the campus it so pretty to be located in the middle of a city. There is always something going on on campus. The only set back is that Boston does not have the greatest under 21 night-life., 167454=Unusual tradition I have witnessed so far is the underwear run in the middle of October when it's freezing out. The amazing thing is that almost everyone participates in it that the cops have to show up just in case there are riots., 500022=The underwear run happens once a year during Parents' weekend, usually end of October, just before Halloween. On a Friday night, a huge portion of the student population gathers outside of the freshman quad in ridiculous outfits. Some students go all out with costumes and themed groups, while others decide to run in sports bras and spandex shorts. It is a great and fun tradition that shows our goofiness and lets everyone have a good time running around the streets of Boston, all around campus, and through the halls of the Prudential center to show our school pride., 228961=The underwear run! It happens in November during parents weekend. Also, the secret of Northeastern! (if you stand in the middle of the science quad and whisper, you can hear yourself as if you were speaking into your own ear!)}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students On campus we have every type of student and a diverse student population. A popular stereotype that you might observe on campus is a hipster student. However, it is hard to stereotype students considering there is so many types. Generally, students here are smart and motivated. At the same time, students are not all bookworms and most are very involved in campus clubs and other activities, as well as participating in a lively social life. Essentially, Northeastern is a perfect fit for students who want a good education, like being able to explore a city, and like the idea of being able to boost your graduating resume through COOP. No student should worry about fitting in because with so many kids on campus, it is easy to make friends and find people your are compatible with. Although, our campus has 15,000 undergrads, it never feels this large, you will still see the same kids daily on your way to class, thus making Northeastern ideal for students seeking a large or small school. Tips for prospective students Prospective students should know that Northeastern is an up and coming school. Students here are proud to be huskies and will boast their campus, spirit, sports teams, and university any chance they get. Boston is a great city and the fact that our green campus is located literally",
