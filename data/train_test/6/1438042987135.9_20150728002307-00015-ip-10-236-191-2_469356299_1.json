            "review Ah, Toby. Your world wasn\u2019t difficult to get into, but I\u2019ve still traveled a hard road to get where we are today. You used to frustrate the hell out o Ah, Toby. Your world wasn\u2019t difficult to get into, but I\u2019ve still traveled a hard road to get where we are today. You used to frustrate the hell out of me, yet we\u2019ve come to an understanding. So much so that I\u2019ve even chosen to remove you from my Glutton For Punishment shelf. Kudos! I hope you stay off it. One Salt Sea finds Toby a tad more adept at researching clues - if only because she\u2019s now willing to call in people with real expertise. That mitigates her fumbling, round-about methods. She\u2019s a hero, not a Holmesian thinker, so I\u2019m terribly pleased that she\u2019s delegating tasks. The case - the kidnapping of two children - has larger implications. If the children are not found alive and well, Faerie war is inevitable. Leave it to Toby to land face-first in the most complicated and dire of situations. But she\u2019s got people! Friends, even! to help her sort it all out. The investigation is pretty standard for the series. As usual, it\u2019s the exploration of Faerie and the varied characters within it that provide the most allure: a trip to the mind-bogglingly colorful and topsy-turvy Undersea; interesting tidbits about the grumpy and mysterious Luideag; prophetic statements from a loopy visitor; factual statements from some misplaced rocks (yes, rocks); and, of course, scenes with the most alluring King of Cats. Oh, that Tybalt. I just can\u2019t get enough of him. Predatory, protective, and tender, with sly amusement in his eyes and an attitude that radiates well-earned confidence. He\u2019s a keeper. There are comical scenes and emotional ones. McGuire\u2019s humor leans towards sarcasm and slapstick, prompting guffaws during otherwise tense moments. (view spoiler)[Who wouldn\u2019t laugh at the idea of Toby hurtling down a hill in a wheelchair, curled up in the lap of a queen? That\u2019s cartoon-comedy gold and I can envision it perfectly. (hide spoiler)]The emotional scenes varied in success; I didn\u2018t personally feel the weight of Toby\u2018s turmoil until the closing chapters. Much of it hinged on me being concerned about a character we\u2019ve had limited knowledge of. I can\u2019t just muster up fear because I\u2019m told to. I need to be invested. The final moments of One Salt Sea did make me teary-eyed though. That emotion, along with the hints at deeper mysteries and the promise of more more more Tybalt ensure that I\u2019ll picking up book six in the series. Seems I\u2019m just a glutton for fantastic fae and hot men\u2026as if we didn\u2019t know that already. ...more",
            "review Oh, Agatha...tut tut tut. Agatha Raisin and the Murderous Marriage is probably the best installment yet. Emotions are high, bodies are piling up, and A Oh, Agatha...tut tut tut. Agatha Raisin and the Murderous Marriage is probably the best installment yet. Emotions are high, bodies are piling up, and Agatha herself has some near misses with the grim reaper. Though it was the pleasant, easy read I've come to expect from Beaton, the pace was faster and the characters better represented. This book accomplishes something the previous four did not: it gives James Lacey a more distinct personality. Previously, he came across as a cardboard cutout of the attractive yet distant bachelor. Though those descriptors still apply, Beaton manages to flesh him out more. Interesting that this coincides with Agatha's rose-coloured glasses losing a bit of their tint. The mystery here is of a personal nature for Agatha, leading her to elaborate on her downtrodden past. I already knew she was ambitious and determined, but her backstory proves she's quite the survivor. As always, village life plays a major role in the story. At times in this series I think it is the story, with the mysteries merely providing structure for the residents' conversations. This is shored up by the fact that Agatha does more blundering than investigating. As friend and police officer Bill Wong comments: \"I don't know if she exactly solved those last crimes, but she made things happen by poking her nose in; otherwise we'd never have got to the murderers.\" (p.89) My opening line is in response to the final pages. For all her business aptitude and ballsy attitude, Agatha makes some disastrous decisions - never more apparent than in this volume. She makes a fabulously horrible one towards the end, setting us up for more emotional turmoil and mayhem. What one earth will she be poking her nose into next? ...more",

Another neat, fast-paced mystery centering on ghastly murders in an otherwise ideal setting. When a rambler (hiker) from a nearby town is found dead in a field, Agatha is called upon to dig up all the info she can. Of course, investigations are far more exciting with James Lacey in tow. And how much more exciting still to go undercover with the chap - as a married couple! Though the mystery has its fair share of plausible, unsettling suspects, the highlight of this tale is the interaction between Agatha and James. Beaton finally throws them together in an inescapable way, forcing the two to sort out their feelings. Since so much of the book is devoted to their relationship, I can't help but note that I don't view them as the best romantic match. James is too adept at seeming indifferent, whilst Agatha is so caught up in her paranoid misconceptions that she can't see her own worth. I find myself wishing she'd forget about a man liking her and instead focus on liking herself. It's irking me more as I read further installments. The ending serves up lots of game-changing moments for the series - tons and tons when you consider how short a book it is. I'm certainly going to keep reading, hopefully wishing that Agatha soon learns some lessons about men - and herself - before she's the one committing murder! ...more",
            "review I have one major issue when it comes to the cozy mystery: just a blink of the eye and I suddenly realise I've spent the better part of an evening comp I have one major issue when it comes to the cozy mystery: just a blink of the eye and I suddenly realise I've spent the better part of an evening completely engrossed in mischief and murder. It's been awhile since I last visited Agatha, yet I found it easy to get sucked back into her not-so-quiet world. She's a strange little woman, one I'd dearly like to shake into feeling more self-assured. If only she could picture herself as others do...but I suppose that's true of all of us and it probably makes the abrasive Agatha more relatable a character. As is common with a cozy mystery (the good ones, at least), The Potted Gardner brings back a cast of familiar characters and makes me feel right at home amidst the village intrigue. The usual question also occurs to me: with so many people getting murdered in this \"idyllic\" locale, why on earth do people stick around?! Agatha is endearing in her ridiculous way, her neighbours delightfully peculiar, and the murder so oddly executed that I was comfortably entrenched from start to finish. I do wish the resolution of the mystery had a bit more wow factor, but again this is often the way of the genre - lots of clues, liberal splashes of local color, and then the answer suddenly arrives wrapped up in a tidy little package. But we read cozies specifically for their comfort value and Agatha Raisin delivers that in spades, along with a welcome dash of humor. The Potted Gardner is an amusing addition to the series, making me anxious to discover Agatha's next embarrassing manoeuvre. And the next murder victim, of course. ...more",

With Valkyrie and Skulduggery facing their most challenging mission yet, the story has a darker and more urgent feel than the previous installments.

This is punctuated by several adults finally commenting on her age, suggesting she take a step back from fighting evil and concentrate on being a kid every so often. Granted, no teen wants to hear these things, but it was good to see Valkyrie considering their words. Her character has had too little depth up to this point, so I welcome her questioning some aspects of her life. The ending prompted a \u201cHoly. Crap.\u201d status update.

            "review Though I\u2019m growing a little tired of this series, Bite Club has enough action and change to keep me reaching for the next one. I\u2019d noted in my review Though I\u2019m growing a little tired of this series, Bite Club has enough action and change to keep me reaching for the next one. I\u2019d noted in my review of Ghost Town that Caine needed to shake things up for Morganville to remain engaging. The last book brought certain storylines to a close; Bite Club does much the same. It ties up more loose ends, forcing Caine into an interesting position: existing adversaries have been dealt with, leaving us little to speculate on when it comes to the next conflict. Since I was unsure about continuing with Morganville, I\u2019m actually quite pleased. When it comes to long-standing series, there\u2019s nothing more welcome than change. With a title like Bite Club, I\u2019m sure most readers can make a solid guess at the plot. And they\u2019d be right. What makes this book different is we aren\u2019t stuck solely in Claire\u2019s POV. Caine frequently takes us into Shane\u2019s head where we learn of the frustration and rage borne of his experiences, and of the protectiveness he feels towards Claire. Putting this side by side with Claire\u2019s observations upped the tension and was a good method of keeping Shane sympathetic when he lashed out. However, it raises a concern: I would hate for a na\u00efve teen reader to perceive an abusive friend/boyfriend as someone who just \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean it\u201d or who needs to be \u201csaved\u201d without outside help. Without the presence of Michael - and his vampire healing and reflexes - the situation would\u2019ve been dire. And Claire allows herself to be manhandled because of her certainty that the people she trusts won\u2019t take things too far. A foolish notion, and one I wouldn\u2019t want to encourage in real life. As always, the most amusing and thrilling interactions are between Claire and the resident vampires. Amelie becomes more intense with each installment, and I look forward to discovering how recent events impact her rule. Myrnin is\u2026Myrnin. Crazy, endearing and dangerous, he\u2019s the one character of Caine\u2019s who never fails to engage me. He\u2019s quite the enigma, and his antics make me chuckle. Although he gets a good amount of page-time, I continually find myself hoping for more. I have my misgivings as to the life of this series, but the air of Out with the Old is promising. It allows me to justify picking up the next release. Fingers crossed that I won\u2019t be disappointed. ...more",
            "review *3.5* Drink Deep is a hard book to review without issuing spoilers. Forgive me if this ends up on the vague side. I bought the book at this week\u2019s New Y *3.5* Drink Deep is a hard book to review without issuing spoilers. Forgive me if this ends up on the vague side. I bought the book at this week\u2019s New York Comic Con, only realizing once I got home that I\u2019d beat the general release by two weeks. Yay for publishers exhibiting at cons! The last installment of Chicagoland Vamps left fans reeling. It was a game-changer, and although I wasn\u2019t surprised by the events of that book, I was anxious to see how Neill would play things out. The answer is\u2026a little awkwardly. Drink Deep is all about balance - or rather, the lack thereof. Merit\u2019s world is askew and she\u2019s desperate to find her footing. Cadogan House is in upheaval because of a GP investigation. Mallory is erratic due to the stress of sorcery exams. The political climate of the city is volatile at best. There isn\u2019t a happy medium in sight, and it all comes to a head when Chicago\u2019s landscape itself goes completely out of whack: rivers and lakes turn a motionless black and the sky takes on a bloodred hue. In short, everyone and everything is just plain off. The pacing seemed rather slow at times, with Merit asking lots of questions but making zero headway. Meanwhile, there were a few connections she could have made but didn\u2019t, forcing me to despair at her inability to see the forest for the trees. As a former grad student of English lit, I\u2019d expect Merit to be a tad more aware of the abundant foreshadowing present in her own life. Because our girl spends most of her waking hours conducting fruitless interviews, there isn\u2019t much time for action. Swordplay is nonexistent in this one and I found myself missing the bad-ass side of Merit. There are some reveals of new supernatural players - I look forward to revisiting them - but on the whole Merit doesn\u2019t do much in the course of her investigation. What few altercations she does have seem forced. I got the notion I was sitting around listening to a warm-up act. A relatively good warm-up, but I\u2019m still waiting for the main event. Let\u2019s call this a bridge book then, with all the expected characteristics thereof, and move on to the characters. Mallory. I hate her. She\u2019s proven time and again that she\u2019s a selfish little bitch and the message comes across even stronger here. She\u2019s unnecessarily rude, a drama queen whose Me Me MEEE show was already tiresome and has crossed the line to intolerable. Merit frequently refers to Mal as being closer than a sister, but from the beginning I\u2019ve been hard-pressed to like the girl. She seems to think it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to take her frustrations out on anyone in proximity. What\u2019s worse is she doesn\u2019t own up to her nastiness after the fact, preferring to hold grudges and utilize emotional blackmail to make Merit (and probably Catcher) feel disproportionately guilty over imagined slights. I would not put up with her antics; I\u2019m continually surprised that Merit and Catcher humor her. Catcher. He\u2019s got such an unrelenting chip on his shoulder. The sorcerer is another malcontent, constantly throwing vitriol Merit\u2019s way. I much preferred it when he was merely Merit\u2019s tutor - at least then I didn\u2019t expect more of him. His \u201cfriendship\u201d with Merit is largely one-sided and I\u2019ve grown tired of his gruff attitude. There isn\u2019t much page-time for Jeff in this installment, which is a shame. I realise now that the shifter\u2019s easy-going nature off-set Catcher\u2019s nastiness, allowing me to see the sorcerer\u2019s better qualities. Another entry for the Off Balance list I suppose. Then we come to the vamps. I enjoyed their part in this. Although under extreme pressure, the Cadogan House residents never take their frustrations out on one another. They're a unit, supportive of each other as their world falls apart. They give Merit the encouragement and motivation she needs, in a way her other friends never do. Add to this the support of Jonah and the Grey House and you have a grouping that beats all others when it comes to getting the job done. And they don\u2019t whine and complain while doing it, either. That makes me wonder: does the positive portrayal of the vampires indicate a reality, or is it the biased result of Merit\u2019s acclimation to her new life? I\u2019m inclined to think the former, since Merit\u2019s voice hasn\u2019t changed drastically over the course of the series. Still, it\u2019s interesting that the vampires are the only competent, accommodating characters from Merit\u2018s POV. The ending. Again I felt the events were forced, as if Neill knew where she wanted to end up no matter the craziness she had to throw at the story to get there. There\u2019s a lackluster face-off with the enemy, including people materializing out of a fog and spouting platitudes pulled straight from the intervention handbook. This is followed by a belated Us Against the World, Vamps Unite! scene, the tone of which conjured memories of after-school specials and feel-good movies. Though it\u2019s fun to speculate on the aftereffects, getting there wasn\u2019t half so entertaining. While I like the set-up of Neill\u2019s world - the supernatural beings, the politics, the hurdles to establishing vampire-human relations - too many of the secondary characters are irksome. Their continued presence in Merit\u2019s life makes me question her discernment. The overall plots are intriguing but the execution is a little choppy, incorporating too many moments of self-reflection and too few instances of Merit actually figuring things out for herself. She\u2019s tenacious in her search for answers, but I wish she was more adept at fitting the pieces together. As I mentioned, this is a bridge book.

Although he is duty-bound to deliver Meghan to Queen Mab, Ash's personal loyalty to the girl is strong. I foresee problems and betrayals ahead! Kagawa's particular skill is economic yet highly-detailed descriptions. Just a few sentences and she had me perfectly envisioning the icy landscape of Tir Na Nog.

            "review Secrets is the best read of the series thus far. While Vic\u2019s relationship with Jacob often took center stage in previous installments (not that I\u2019m co Secrets is the best read of the series thus far. While Vic\u2019s relationship with Jacob often took center stage in previous installments (not that I\u2019m complaining), Secrets perfectly combines all aspects of the series into a cohesive, thrilling whole. Vic and Jacob continue to engage me. Vic has many adjustments to make in trying to be the best boyfriend he can, but none of these deprive him of who he is. Instead, his new life with Jacob allows him to explore and confront subjects he\u2019s been avoiding for too long. I love that this relationship plus his growing list of friends grant him the stability and the courage he needs to delve into his traumatic past. We\u2019ve seen hints of what Vic went through during training, but I find it appropriate that JCP built up a support system around him before delving into the nitty-gritty. That support system becomes all the more solid in this book. Lisa reappears, Carolyn becomes a little more fleshed out, new partner Zig is confirmed as a decent guy, and Crash - well, Crash is complicated, but as an empath with a good heart I foresee him putting aside his Jacob-jealousy in an instant if need be. Jacob, though he has a nasty little habit of omitting certain things, is all about protecting and helping Vic. All of these characters give Vic the sounding boards and support he\u2019ll need to explore the frightening topic of Camp Hell. Very nice set-up for the next installment. As for this one, Vic and Lisa find themselves aiding Jacob and Carolyn in their latest case. There are some interesting discussions of abilities, as all the Psy factions give opinions on how much is too much - what limitations they\u2019re comfortable setting on the use of their powers (both for the police force and friends). It presents an interesting perspective, allowing us to understand how difficult it might be to deal with such skills. The case itself is a creepy one, pushing some characters to their moral limits and making us wonder if they\u2019ll go too far in the search for justice. This is balanced against the titular secrets Vic starts to uncover and I\u2019m fascinated by what he\u2019ll find out. Although this installment broaches more serious topics, there\u2019s still a lot to smile over. Vic\u2019s humor is understated and stellar; I found myself chuckling more than ever. Jacob and Vic have some very steamy moments and I\u2019m enjoying all of their newfound kinks. More than their sex life though, I especially appreciate their ups and downs. They have a more realistic relationship than many I\u2019ve encountered, slowly learning about each other\u2019s wants and needs and adjusting accordingly. And as I\u2019ve already said, having Jacob by his side gives Vic the security he needs for some self-exploration - more drama and intrigue for us! Secrets ends on a mini-cliffhanger. Not a Holy Shit! More of an\u2026Ohhhhh, Snap sort of ending. It definitely makes me want the next book, but it\u2019s a moment of logical progression rather than a cheap tactic. I\u2019m torn between wanting to snatch up the next installment right away, or taking a little break so I can savor the series - I\u2019m going to be sad when I\u2019m all caught up and can\u2019t get my instant Vic fix! ...more",

Children will be fascinated by Hiccup\u2019s exploits: his Viki These books are extremely entertaining. There\u2019s appeal here for both kids and adults alike. Children will be fascinated by Hiccup\u2019s exploits: his Viking training sessions, his interactions with dragons of all shapes and sizes, his marvelous ability to outsmart smarmy characters. Adults will enjoy these aspects, too, but may be even more impressed with the emphasis on brains vs. brawn, Hiccup\u2019s determination to be his own person, and the main characters\u2019 willingness to work as a team when it matters. Add to all of these qualities a healthy dose of easy humor and Cowell\u2019s series is excellent so far. How to Speak Dragonese ends with a charming epilogue from the point of view of the present-day Hiccup. This may have been my favorite part of the book, though I\u2019m not sure how it will go over with the kiddies since it\u2019s more adult in tone. It\u2019s a moment of reflection and summary that reminds us of the important things: \"However small we are, we should always fight for what we believe to be right. And I don\u2019t mean fight with the power of our fists or the power of our swords\u2026I mean the power of our brains and our thoughts and our dreams. And as small and quiet and unimportant as our fighting may look, perhaps we might all work together\u2026and break out of the prisons of our own making.

            "review Hiccup Horrendous Haddock the Third is not so Heroic - at least not by Viking terms - despite the fact that he\u2019s the Hooligan chief\u2019s only heir. What Hiccup Horrendous Haddock the Third is not so Heroic - at least not by Viking terms - despite the fact that he\u2019s the Hooligan chief\u2019s only heir. What he is is very, very clever, an attribute overlooked in a society revering such skills as Shouting, Senseless Violence, Badd Sppeling, and Advanced Rudery. (Well, with a clan name of Hooligans, what did you expect?) Hiccup is Heroic by my standards though. He reads and observes and studies, and uses that brain of his to make decisions for the good of his tribe - even if it means he looks more than a bit useless in the process. How to Be a Pirate finds Hiccup learning Swordfighting at Sea with both hilarious and catastrophic results. As he showed in How to Train Your Dragon, Hiccup is more than willing to try, try, try again. He\u2019s also not too afraid to speak his mind when the adults around him are about to do foolish things (adults can be rather silly) like open a cursed coffin or trundle off on a suicidal hunt for legendary treasure. He manages to keep his head in scary situations, and he stands up for what he believes in. Admirable traits indeed, resulting in a character we want to root for. Hiccup\u2019s companions don\u2019t really fit in with the Viking norm either. His best friend, Fishlegs, has \u201ca squint, a limp, numerous allergies, and no coordination whatsoever,\u201d not to mention an utterly inept dragon. But he\u2019s loyal and smart and supportive of Hiccup - what more can you ask for in a friend? Hiccup\u2019s dragon, Toothless, is small and contrary and demanding as heck; he\u2019s constantly giving Hiccup a hard time. However, he\u2019s the only dragon in the whole Hooligan clan who sticks around when things go arseways. Though he may complain bitterly about heading into danger, he\u2019s actually a faithful little thing who helps both boys when it counts. These three are not well-loved by their tribe, but it doesn\u2019t matter much since they have each other. Since the rest of the characters are beefy, battle-hungry Vikings, How to Be a Pirate includes a fair amount of fighting and bullying. This is balanced against Hiccup\u2019s distaste for such behaviour, taking the glamour out of the violence. As the story unfolds, Cowell\u2019s message of brain over brawn is abundantly clear; I don\u2019t think kids will have any problems discerning which route is preferable. The illustrations are horrible\u2026in a good way. Simple, unrefined pencil sketches, they give us an idea of what the characters look like while providing amusement. They look like doodles more than anything, adding to the feel that we\u2019re reading Hiccup\u2019s personal diary. The pacing was great: brisk, with several cliffhanger chapter endings to keep kids eagerly flipping pages, yet Cowell still managed to incorporate lots of character development, too. For a chapter book, I\u2019m surprised at how well Hiccup\u2019s personality is described. Rather than coming off as a mere template, he possesses depth, making the lessons more poignant. I imagine this also makes it a more enjoyable read for the adults involved in storytime. How to Be a Pirate is a silly book. It will make you chuckle and smile and shake your head in exasperation. At the same time, it presents a valuable message without ever seeming preachy. I think young readers will be immensely entertained - so much so they won\u2019t even notice the lessons on being selfless and thoughtful as they sneakily seep into their brains. ...more",
            "review I managed four of the five stories of this collection. Unfortunately, the last was so tedious and silly my patience utterly failed me and I couldn\u2019t b I managed four of the five stories of this collection. Unfortunately, the last was so tedious and silly my patience utterly failed me and I couldn\u2019t bear to read another. Gogol\u2019s Diary of a Madman is the starting point. Written at first in a conversational tone, it allows for easy entry into the mind of the narrator. He is a shabby man, desirous of acknowledgement, and supposes those around him jealous of the time he spends in the Director\u2019s office sharpening quills. Yes, quills. It seems in the beginning to be a somewhat relatable story: a downtrodden clerk disheartened by the fact that the Haves get what they want while the Have-Nots scrounge for even the smallest success. However, it rapidly transforms into a detailed account of a descent into madness. The man\u2019s antics are comical in many ways, but they are undoubtedly tragic, with Gogol neatly capturing the narrator\u2019s paranoid delusions and frequently manic behaviour. At the conclusion of the story, the reader is further horrified by the abuse the titular madman suffers and the clarity with which he wishes to break fully from reality. This is followed by The Nose which tells the ludicrous story of an ambitious man waking one morning to find his nose gone - only a flat expanse of skin in its place. While the introduction claims many interpretations for the tale, I must agree with those pinning it as a satire of the civil service officers of the time. The noseless collegiate assessor is so unctuous before this occurrence, and so thoroughly vain and frantic after, that Gogol\u2019s focus seems clear. The assessor cares only for one thing: how the loss of his nose will affect his social standing. While trying to retrieve his wandering body part, the assessor is faced with a variety of unhelpful, cardboard civil servants, further highlighting Gogol\u2019s dislike of the breed. The whole story is told at a frenetic pace and makes as little sense at the end as it does in the beginning. The author himself claims in a final aside that the story is \u201cfar-fetched\u201d and \u201cabsurd,\u201d but that perhaps there might be a grain of truth in it after all. The third offering is The Overcoat, a story I attempted to read years ago but never completed. I\u2019m unsure why, as it\u2019s easily the most engaging of the group. Once again centering on a civil servant, this one prompts feelings of pity and sympathy from the outset. A quiet man, content in his role, has his existence shaken when he must scrape together his meager earnings to buy a new overcoat. He manages to obtain this shining new possession, but with disastrous results. It\u2019s a story filled with worry and foreboding, with an ending that implies Gogol wants us to feel sorry for this poor little man who has spent his life quietly enduring the ridicule and dismissal of his peers. How Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled with Ivan Nikiforovich was the story that tried my patience and made me give up. It\u2019s a tedious account of the falling out between two bosom buds. The supercilious Ivanovich and the unpolished Nikiforovich are both tiresome characters (though the latter grated on me a little less). Their feud is based on the most ridiculous of insults and one wonders how deep the friendship could have been for such a non-event to have parted them. Ivanovich plays up the role of the injured party to anyone who might listen, leaving the impression that he enjoys the scandal of it all. The story includes several outlandish plaints presented to the local judge, Gogol\u2019s way of ridiculing the court system of the setting. The introduction highlights Gogol\u2019s frustration and displeasure with the bureaucracy of St. Petersburg and the Ukraine. Were I capable of examining these stories within historical context, perhaps I\u2019d have a greater appreciation for Gogol\u2019s narrative intentions. As it stands, his political criticisms are by and large lost on me, while his sense of the absurd does not appeal. Although I\u2019m glad I explored a sample of his writing, I can say without a doubt that Gogol is not an author I will return to. ...more",
            "review That was exciting. Spirit Dances is probably the most cohesive, well-plotted story since the first of the series. It takes all of Murphy\u2019s promises an That was exciting. Spirit Dances is probably the most cohesive, well-plotted story since the first of the series. It takes all of Murphy\u2019s promises and hints and brings them to the fore in the great mash-up of change and progress I hoped was on its way. Although I\u2019ve been frustrated at times by Joanne\u2019s brute force way of dealing with magic, this installment strongly reinforces the idea of a build-up to transition. It\u2019s now very clear that Joanne had to undergo all her flailing and wailing to prepare for the next step. Although there\u2019s no Gary (how dare he go on vacation?), there is a lot of Morrison. His reactions are priceless, and though he\u2019s frequently exasperated we\u2019re keenly aware of how much he, too, has changed over the course of the series. Or perhaps Jo has gotten more adept at understanding him, despite the confusion he causes her. Either way, it was delightful to finally have them share numerous scenes outside the office. Joanne repeatedly puts her foot in her mouth; her mortification was hilarious. Morrison confirms that the man behind the badge is just as intriguing and attractive as I hoped. I\u2019ve been waiting forever for these two to communicate properly but in hindsight the timing was perfect. In light of a recent conversation, I feel compelled to point out: Joanne has had a few different men interested in her over the last year, and sometimes she\u2019s shared that attraction. However, it isn\u2019t a case of the UF heroine drawing men in against all logic. I like Joanne, and I can fully understand why these men would as well. We get the impression she\u2019s a knockout, but in a very unassuming, tomboyish way. We also know her looks aren\u2019t the primary factor. She\u2019s good-natured and infinitely well-meaning. She prompts so many amused looks in her friends and colleagues that she seems to radiate humor. She\u2019s got enough doubt and concern to slice through any potential arrogance. Plus, she\u2019s willing to give credit where credit is due and to call on others for help, keeping her approachable and connected. Her fear of becoming emotionally involved with others makes all this more remarkable. Hurrah for a UF heroine whose personality validates the loyalties she\u2019s won. Those loyalties extend out from this plane of existence into the spiritual one. Joanne\u2019s guides are becoming an integral part of the story and I love how their inclusion ups the tangibility of her magic. Spirit Dances incorporates some of the most coherent metaphysical workings to date. Maybe Murphy\u2018s interpretations have improved, maybe I\u2018ve just gotten used to the magic system - but I suspect it might also be a purposeful shift as Joanne gains knowledge. Whatever the reason, I\u2019m grateful that her abilities are now easier to grasp. The focus of Spirit Dances stays on Jo\u2019s magic rather than her police work - I found I was grateful for that as well. This was the first time I felt her shamanism take precedence over her detective identity, a shift that\u2018s appropriate and brings Joanne closer to realizing her potential. And then we\u2019ve got the ending. It\u2019s one that\u2019s got me all geared up and excited and almost makes me wish I\u2019d held off on reading book six. A year seems a long time to wait when the final pages have Joanne poised on the brink of Exciting Discoveries.

Although it had its quirks, it was an enjoyable read that kept me guessing most of the way. Stevens chooses an interesting profession for her protagonist - that of graveyard restorer. It struck me as an odd career for a woman who can see ghosts yet must never acknowledge their presence (for fear they\u2019ll leach away her life energy). Ever vigilant against the specters around her, Amelia is tightly controlled and strictly adheres to the rules her father set for dealing with the dead\u2026at least until she meets the brooding Detective Devlin. Despite her outward reserve, it\u2019s easy enough to be in Amelia\u2019s headspace for the duration of the novel. Her practical, cautious nature is balanced against her instant, inadvisable connection to Devlin. This gives her relatively flat personality some much-needed layers, as she teeters on the edge of dismissing her structured lifestyle and purposefully tempting fate. (I just wish she didn\u2019t feel the need to constantly remind us that a relationship with Devlin would be a big no-no.) My one big gripe with Amelia has less to do with the character and more to do with writing style. Stevens\u2019 character repeatedly speaks from a future POV: \u201cNothing could be further from the truth, of course, because despite everything, our destinies were already intertwined. We just didn\u2019t know it.\u201d p. 112 I loathe this device, which unfortunately rears its ugly head in several chapters. It strikes me as pretentious and interrupts the flow of the story. A personal peeve, perhaps, but one I know others share. I hope it\u2019s dropped or used sparingly in the next installment. Stevens\u2019 male lead is suitably tragic and enigmatic, without falling too far into the role of Wounded Man in Need of Saving. His meeting Amelia seems a catalyst for introspection; I appreciate this route rather than Devlin undergoing some wholesale personality change. If you\u2019re looking for a strong romance thread you might be disappointed, but Stevens leaves the door open for future exploration of Amelia and Devlin\u2019s relationship and subsequently for further examination of the characters themselves. The author also indicates that Amelia doesn\u2019t know all the facts about her ability or the supernatural forces in her world. She doesn\u2019t bombard us with multiple factions and powers. Instead she slowly introduces clues that set Amelia on edge and serve as encouragement for the reader to continue the series. One character in particular seems to have a lot of answers and I\u2019m anxious to discover what Amelia can learn through their association. The Restorer did not wow me. But it did provide suspense and mystery in a way that kept me flipping pages and made me curious about Stevens\u2019 plan for her paranormal world. With the first book out of the way and Amelia placed distinctly outside her comfort zone, I think future installments will bring ever more twisty mysteries and more insight into the people and creatures The Graveyard Queen attracts. Stevens has piqued my interest enough that I\u2019ll follow Amelia for another adventure or two. ...more",

In each, the titular character experiences both the advantages and disadvantages of being the smallest zombie around. He constantly has to vie against larger, tougher zombies for the slim human pickings, but at the same time his size often allows him to wander undetected by the armed survivors.

The first story is based on a toy idea Mignola had - like him, I would certainly buy such a thing. A robot head with a light-bulb base! Interchangable bodies! Most fascinating! In this one-shot, Screw-on Head is an hero called upon by President Lincoln to stop a nepharious plot by the Emperor Zombie. Both characters are terribly inept and silliness ensues. It's a fun story, particularly the dialogue between Screw-on Head and his unflappable butler. I do so love a butler. The rest of the stories are very short, most having appeared previously in various anthologies. The most notable is \"The Prisoner of Mars\" because, let's face it, who can resist a story about the afterlife and aliens? Mignola's artwork continues to be distinctive and readily recognizable.

His panels look both rough and amazingly detailed, and I'm always fascinated by what he can convey without having to zero in on his characters' facial expressions.

Though there was much about her I adored, though **3.75?** I had declared, after reading An Artificial Night, that Toby Daye and I simply would not do. Though there was much about her I adored, though her friends were lovely, entertaining people, Toby and I just didn\u2019t see eye-to-eye. And so I bid her a fond farewell, wishing her all the best with those who might appreciate her better. Insistent friends pleaded with me to give her another chance. \u201cNo, no,\u201d said I. \u201cYou can never go back on that sort of decision. It just leads to more disappointment.\u201d But perhaps, every now and again, you can go back and the result will be surprising and fresh - all of the good things you remembered with very little of the bad to drag it all down. And so it went with Toby and I. Late Eclipses focuses more on Toby and her past than any of the previous books, and perhaps therein lies the difference. Yes, there are mysterious illnesses to cure, foes to battle, and political nastiness to defend against. But at the center of it all is the question of who Toby is and who she wants to be. This time around, plot devices demand that she become aware of her limitations, that she think before she acts (sometimes) and the result is a more balanced hero. She spends a fair amount of time dashing back and forth as per her usual, but her investigation follows a logical path - a relief, because logic and Toby haven\u2018t always been bosom buds. She also accepts that running around alone often does more harm than good. With friends and allies by her side, Toby comes closer to performing an efficient investigation than she ever has before. Match this newfound sensible nature with Toby\u2019s helpful and caring personality and her likability spikes dramatically. Add in the humorous touches that McGuire is already adept at and the result is an enjoyable installment. Imagine - I only wanted to shake Toby once, maybe twice, throughout the whole of the book! I no longer paused every chapter to shake my head and think, \u201cOh, Toby, dear. Get a brain already!\u201d Instead, I was wrapped up in the story and curious how everything was going to pan out. I\u2019ll admit there were some obvious details, but there were so many other tidbits flying around that I found myself forgiving a few clue-by-fours. Alongside Toby\u2019s improvements, we have frequent stolen moments with the ever-desirable Tybalt (he of the tight leather pants). Note to Curran fans: know that this enigmatic cait sidhe is taking a page straight from the Beast Lord\u2019s handbook. Why, oh, why do we find this practically feral sort of possessiveness attractive? Damned if I know - I just want more of it. Though the revelation of Tybalt and Toby\u2019s mutual attraction is taking its time to unfurl, the glimpses McGuire provides are delicious and tantalizing enough to carry us through to the next volume. With this novel, I\u2019m coming to a greater appreciation of the author\u2019s humor. Sometimes slapstick, often wry and always with a hint of self-deprecation, McGuire creates scenes and drops one-liners that command a snort or chuckle. It\u2019s these moments that endear the characters to me and make me want to revisit them. Pacing and plot hindered my enjoyment before, but Late Eclipses has given me newfound hope that maybe, just maybe, Toby and I can work out after all. ...more"
