            "This college is definitely for students who are hard-working, friendly, compassionate, adventurous, and who are leaders. Elmhurst offers many opportunities for students to get involved, be a leader, give back to the community, and even see the world!",
            "If you already know what major you want to get into, I would really look into the program that the college has for you. Don't be afraid to ask questions and wonder how their program will benefit you. Or if you are undecided, there is more than enough help from faculty and many facilities on campus to help you through your decision. Elmhurst College is big on having a liberal-arts education, so you will get to experience every subject.",
            "This is a private school, so do not expect it to be cheap. It is pretty expensive, but the college compensates by giving out several scholarships and grants. There are many job opportunities on campus and the college is an a convenient area where you can even get a job off-campus. But as my mother always told me, You got to invest in yourself. Education is something that will be beneficial to you in the long run.",
            "Even though Elmhurst can be really cheesy about getting involved and becoming a better student through participating with the extra-curriculars on campus, they just mean well. I am very involved with a sorority, the student newspaper, and the National Student Speech-Language-Hearing Association. I am more than ecstatic that I got involved, it really helped me feel comfortable and make new friends.",
            "If there is one thing to brag about Elmhurst College, it's their faculty. Since my time here I have not had a problem with any of my professors. All the professor's are extremely helpful and are willing to set appointments with you if you are having a difficult time understanding the material. The typical ratio from professor to student is about 14:1. So if you are a more personal learner and are extremely nervous about attending to a huge lecture hall of about 300 students, Elmhurst College is where you need to be."
