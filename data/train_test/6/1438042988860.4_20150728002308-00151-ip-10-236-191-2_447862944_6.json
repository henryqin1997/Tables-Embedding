This is for indicative purposes only, your EMI payments may differ with total order amount and additional bank charges, if any. Select your preferred EMI option at the time of payment. Final EMI is calculated on the total value of your order at the time of payment. The Bank charges annual interest rates according to the reducing monthly balance. In the monthly reducing cycle, the principal is reduced with every EMI and the interest is calculated on the outstanding balance. The minimum order value to avail the EMI payment option is Rs 4,000. This option is available only when the cart contains items from a single seller. In case of any kind of refund in an EMI transaction, interest already billed in a particular transaction will not be refundable under any circumstances. While you will not be charged a processing fee for availing Flipkart's EMI option, the interest charged by the bank shall not be refunded by Flipkart. You may check with the respective bank/issuer on how a cancellation, refund or pre-closure could affect the EMI terms, and what interest charges would be levied on you for the same. + Rs 100 Delivery ?",
