    "textBeforeTable": "InstantAction's breakout hit, Legions, is expanding its universe once again with a fresh new map - Zenith Cauldron. Boasting real estate four times larger than the two previously released maps (Nivosus and Moonshine), Zenith Cauldron offers players the extra space to make every match a true exercise in both tactics and skill. Expanding on the environments currently available, the new map's large desert-themed playing field will feature a plethora of rolling dunes allowing players to take full advantage of the Legion's \"ski\" feature. Zenith Cauldron also features large slopes surrounding the two bases so players can get a good jump right after spawning. Players should also forward to exploring Zenith Cauldron with the soon-to-be-released \"Outrider\" class. Legions, their TRIBES-like shooter, saying a new \"Outrider\" player class will launch soon: InstantAction announces the addition of a new map for the beta of [Aug 12, 2008, 9:13 pm ET] - Share - Viewing Comments New Legions Map --> Blue's News Favorite!

    "textAfterTable": "Re: No subject Aug 13, 2008, 22:26 Beaner \u00a0 Its quite funny. When the game started they were obviously trying to differentiate it from Tribes but yet keep it similiar. They ran into some pitfalls and obviously a large number of Tribes players who werent too keen on some of the attributes of the game. Since then its becoming more Tribes like which is great. No one even knew they would add what is basically a light class (outrider) and also they are adding what is basically the heavy (sentinel). But its pretty much a skeleton of a game right now. Hardly any content. There are also questionable issues with the whole browser thing. I still hope someday, some dev company worthy will actually make a good successor. Not Tribes like but Tribes.
