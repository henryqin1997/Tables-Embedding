            "Our food trailers is amazing, and it is very popular, but a very unusual hangout place.",
            "As we all know, it is not inexpensive to go to Keiser University. Some people don't understand why... and this is due to the number of degrees they offer, for a very short amount of time, the hands on training and practice the students get in the lab, on the job, and in the classrooms. I think that this school is amazing , and i don't and will not have any regrets about my choice to attend this college.",
            "At the Melbourne campus, a lot of the students join clubs and organizations at the school to have social time. Some of us, medical assisting student will plan a study group, lunch, dinner, or night out to hangout with each other and work on class work.",
            "I do not live in a dorm so I do not know.",
            "Sign Up at Keiser University. Learn by doing the skills you will need in your career, with some of the best teachers you could ask for. If you are looking to get a good education, and fast, with hands on practice, I would suggest Keiser University to anyone!",
            "I love the campus I attend, the program I attend, and the staff and teachers who work with us. I am in the Medical Assisting Program, and I enjoy all the hands-on lab experience we get at Keiser. I would not trade schools if i was offered money too."
