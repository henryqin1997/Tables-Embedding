            "There is a recreation room in the S building where you can play games and talk with people. I usually walk around to find people to talk with or attend some events.",
            "The food in college is what I consider expensive. There is a small food court that has only three restaurants. Domino's, La Fortuna, and Subway. The best restaurant I would recommend for new comers is Subway. The food is in manageable prince and the quantity is filling. If you want a cheaper deal, you can walk from campus to Wendy's or McDonald's for 15 minutes walk.",
            "The dorms here are fairly in fair price range. Before getting a place to stay, you would have to get an apartment guide to find the right price. Once you find the right price, you would have to do a tour of that place to see if you feel safe in that place. Once you find that place, you can then move there. First, it will feel really scary because you are new. Then, you will meet new friends and find that they come to college for the same reason as you and you will turn out to have study buddies as well.",
            "The academic in the college here depends on the professor and the courses you take. If you take a science class, the course is usually difficult but yet manageable. In these classes, the professor matters the most because there is a huge vary in the type of professor there are for these classes. Some of them are so difficult it is hard to pass. Some of them are so easy and getting an A is a joke.",
            "If you ever want to come to this college, make sure that you are well planned. This college is what I would call a second chance for those who was not able to enter in the University after high school. This will give you an opportunity to make up your grades, and be able to transfer quickly.",
            "I think that the opinion of the college would vary based on the person and experiences each person had. My experience here was not the best. I had lots of issues that took place that affected my grades in this college."

There are many degrees you can get within two years, degrees that can guarantee you a job in the future. Tips for prospective students I am currently working at the Financial Aid office here,so the biggest advice I can give you is to keep up with your Financial Aid and scholarships make sure everything is set. Another thing is to have a good attitude, people are more willing to help you if you are kind to them. Bang for the buck Although it is not a University, there are programs here where you can earn a Bachelor's degree, and of course it's much cheaper. There is a food bank that gives food out every Wed. there is also a vegetable garden where they provide",
