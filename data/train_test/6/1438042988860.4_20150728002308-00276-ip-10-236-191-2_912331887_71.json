            "Recent High School graduates. It's small classes, teachers are more one-on-one with you. Definitely a great transition for those moving into a bigger university right from High School.",

            "Definitely quality and the price is so affordable.",

            "Don't waste time and money, know what you want or at least have an idea! Always ask for help, do everything you can to get the right answer. Get involved! It really isn't about the grades anymore... anyone can have good grades! They want you to be well rounded! Clubs, Orgs, Student Life, anything!",
            "They are a great school, but their Student Life can change many things to make it even better for all the students. Over all, it's a great school and a great place to start at if you're not sure what to do, or if you have a financial situation that does not let you go directly into a big university. I definitely recommend this school to those thinking of going to college but still can't throw themselves to the big universities."

It is great for those of us who have to pay out of pocket and are on a limited budget., 687922=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 314376=Classes are inexpensive. There are ways to make payment plans on campus or online. A full semester at ACC is usually $2000 cheaper than most tuition at other universities., 111141=Returning back to school after so many years was really very hard. Feeling like Goldilocks, I needed a school that was not too big, not too small, not too cold, not too hot, not too hard, not too soft, but just right! That is what Austin Community College is for me. It is just right. This place is the ideal place to: get your Associates Degree, transfer to a larger University, or just to get the ideal technical degree that you need in order to get an ideal career under way. Austin Community college is ideal for several reasons. First, the cost is lesser than most. Second, this is a college that believes in second chances and as such the college offers a level of teaching that is hard to match. First, let us discuss cost. Cost, did I mention money? Yes, I did, and here is the skinny of the deal. One nearby public university charges resident students $423 per semester hour. Another nearby university charges resident students $618 and these two are public universities! If you want to price a private liberal arts college, her resident students pay $1038 per semester hour at a minimum. So basically, you can go to Austin Community College and pay $57 per semester hour. Why would you pay the cost of one of the local universities when you can get upwards of 60 hours at a discounted rate! I plan to graduate with my Associates in fall 2012 before continuing on to get my Bachelors at a local university. I estimate that I have saved $ 13,200 in tuition costs just by attending Austin Community College for the two years prior! Second, this is a college that believes in second chances. Usually when you think of community college you think of some guy in some big hair band that flunked out of life. Mean but it is a stereotype, right? Guess what? I have published Professors. I have professors that have spent years making a difference in the world for the better. These people are part of activist groups. They are people who give within their community. These are the professors that want a well educated society that encompass the ideal citizen. They want a citizenry group that grasps hold of the economic, educational, monetary and political reigns controlling the future of America. All of the campus locations have learning labs with Professors working in the lab. Not to mention that most lab employees hold doctorates and/or masters degrees. Not only are they helping you walk the walk, they have walked it before you. While you are trying to work toward an Associates Degree they have done it and might have a PHD in their title but they do not look down upon you. Well, that is just how great my school is. My school outshines the others strictly because of the lesser economic burden and the excellent service. How can you lose? Check it! www.austincc.edu., 647736=Everybody is too rude, and too much of a hassle for it to be a bang for your buck. Also it's way more expensive than it should be. 4 courses = $1000 a semester if you're in district. 4 courses = $4000 a semester if you're out of district. See the problem here? I do. I came here to save money, but I'm not saving hardly anything. I should have just gone to a university., 629305=Yes! I almost went to a university when I graduated high school in 2011, and as I am about to start UT engineering in Fall 2014, I do not regret my decision to go to community college for the basics. I am going into UT with my first two years of college paid for and have not had to take out any loans. I worked my way through ACC and found it very do-able. The classes are very flexible and the option of online classes is available too, so you can tailor your school schedule to work around your work schedule or other responsibilities in your life. I went to school full-time almost every semester and the tuition was a little over a thousand each semester where each credit hour is around $60. Compared to other colleges, where it costs thousands upon thousands each semester, that is a steal! I had some fabulous teachers who have taught at UT and many other well-known universities, so the quality of education is still very good for the price! I personally took a lot out of my education here and feel ready to tackle the rigors of UT engineering, and it is perfect for those not wanting to loan out their entire college career. A side note, the rate is about $60 an hour if you are considered IN-DISTRICT. If you are considered out-of-district, then you end up pay around three times more a semester than someone who is in-district. That still is way cheaper compared to a regular university, however I recommend somehow moving into an in-district location in order to pay the cheaper price. That is what I did when I lived in Dripping Springs. Although I will note, that the in-district line has expanded since I first started since they have built more campuses, like the Hays location. If you are wondering whether you fall in or out-of district, they have that information on their website.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Student Life offers a diverse array of clubs and community events. Great for these types of students ACC is great for all kinds of students who want to learn from community oriented instructors. ACC hires intellectual staff who believe in enriching and cultivating the minds of the those who want to learn. I am personally highly impressed by the director of the music program at ACC Northridge as he has worked for major recording labels and knows the music business inside and out. Share any unusual traditions or locations on campus The ACC mascot is the ACC River Bats. An adorable purple bat which pays homage to the legacy of Austin, Texas bat colonies. Bang for the buck For the price, you can not get a better deal. The quality of the staff, services, and facilities is exemplary. They keep the campuses clean, well stocked with technology, quality classes, and a relaxed atmosphere. What to do for fun Austin Community College District has many clubs and student events. Live music, theater, special speakers and lectures, recitals, and public awareness events are a constant at ACC. ACC takes pride in community involvement and enrichment of the community they serve.
