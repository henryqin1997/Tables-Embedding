That will allow you to stitch true rectilinear for the best possible looking photos. I already had the 24G or else I sure wish I had the 24PC-E instead since I've been shooting more interiors than landscapes lately. If you just need to do this a couple times as a fill in for someone else, then the Sigma 10-20 f/4 (the \"older\" version of this lens) is the best for the money. If you find yourself needing to go much wider than 14-16mm rethink the composition.",
