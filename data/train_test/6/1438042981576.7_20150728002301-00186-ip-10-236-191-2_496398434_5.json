    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{23341=FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a resistive elastomeric element 10 which has many thin alternating layers of an insulating elastomeric material 11 and a resistive elastomeric material 12. The resistance of layer 12 can be varied by using various conductive materials to manufacture layer 12 and also by varying the dimensions of element 10. The resistance is directly proportional to the height of element 10 (increases with increased height), and inversely proportional to the area of the surface of layer 12 that is making contact (decreases with increased area). In the preferred embodiment, resistive layers 12 are a silicone rubber containing a conductive material, while insulating layers 11 are a silicone rubber that does not have conductive material. Also in this preferred embodiment, the resistance of layer 12 is between five hundred ohms and five thousand ohms. The resistive properties of element 10 are used to form isolation resistors. Resistive layers 12 form a set of resistors having surface 13 of element 10 as a first terminal for connecting to the resistor and surface 14 as a second terminal. By placing surface 13 in contact with the leads or terminals of a semiconductor component and utilizing surface 14 as a second contact, element 10 forms a set of series resistors with each resistor having a first terminal connected to a terminal of the semiconductor component and a second terminal of the resistor formed by surface 14. In the preferred embodiment, a section of element 10 approximately 2.1 centimeters long provides contact to eight terminals on one side of a sixteen pin dual in line integrated circuit package. In this embodiment, the individual layers of element 10 have a spacing of approximately 1960.0 microns (about one sixth the width of the semiconductor terminals), therefore, at least five resistive layers of element 10 will always be in contact with each terminal even if the element is misaligned to the semiconductor component. This insures at least one resistive layer will be in contact with the terminal of the semiconductor component and provide an isolation resistor in series with the terminal. Contact to surface 14 is provided with a pattern of conductors that mechanically contact the resistive layers of surface 14. In the preferred embodiment, surface 14 is contacted with a pattern of conductors on a printed circuit board wherein the conductor pattern also provides interconnect to other signals on the printed circuit board. Therefore, the resistive characteristics of element 10 enables the formation of isolation resistors in series with the terminals of semiconductor components simply by contacting the terminals, while the thin layers minimize the impact of misalignment with the terminals. Material to make element 10 is available from Shin-Etsu Polymer of Union City, Calif. as model number S-05.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations By now it should be appreciated that there has been provided a novel way to form isolation resistors for semiconductor components. The use of resistive elastomeric elements to form isolation resistors provides the mechanism for configuring flexible semiconductor interconnect systems. The use of resistive elastomers for isolation resistors can be used for a variety of interconnect systems in many configurations to eliminate the need for individual isolation resistors mounted on boards, and to eliminate the need for sockets or other component connectors. An interconnect system facilitated by the resistive elastomeric elements provides a high degree of flexibility for assemblies used for final testing and burn-in of semiconductor components. Sockets are no longer required, thereby eliminating damages to the assembly caused by repair operations and extending the useful life of the assembly. One interconnect system can be used for testing or burn-in a variety of semiconductor package types thereby lowering costs and improving manufacturing efficiency. In addition, lead or pin damage to the semiconductor device is eliminated since the device is no longer plugged into a socket. FIG. 3 is an implementation of a resistive elastomeric connection assembly suitable for using resistive elastomeric elements as series resistors for isolating semiconductor components. In the preferred embodiment, the connection assembly of FIG. 3 is especially suitable for using resistive elastomeric elements to electrically isolate semiconductor components supported by a lead frame as shown in FIG. 2. A printed circuit",
