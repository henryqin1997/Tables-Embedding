    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets In the foregoing, the description of the invention relates above all to a supercharged four-stroke diesel engine of reduced compression ratio, but the invention could apply equally to two-stroke engines, provided that the circulation of the gases is controlled at least by exhaust valves with electronically controlled opening. It appears clearly from the foregoing that, as a result of the succession of several compression/expansion strokes, the invention makes it possible to produce an internal-combustion engine with internal heating of the air supply. Of course, in the event that a central processing unit replaces the three individual units 24, 26 and 28 which have been illustrated, a central cycle-modifying circuit could replace the three individual circuits 46, 48 and 50. The particular types of opening of the exhaust valve (delayed opening, partial opening or opening with choking), described with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3, can be prepared in the processing unit 28 on the basis of information likewise supplied by the inhibitor circuit 50 or supplied directly by the regulating circuit 45. According to the invention, the electronic control system has added to it an electronic cycle-modifying system. This system can consist of three signal-inhibiting circuits 46, 48 and 50 connected to the processing units 24, 26 and 28 and periodically cancelling the valve-opening control signals and the injection control signals which are normally prepared by the processing units on the basis of a signal",
