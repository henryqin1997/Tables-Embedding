Outside of the nitrogen filled glovebox, 0.93 gram deionized water was added to the solution and the solution was vigorously shaken for one minute, then transferred to a 23 milliliter Teflon lined non-stirred, pressure vessel (Pressure Vessel Model #4749, commercially available from Parr Instruments Co., Moline, Ill.) that was purged with nitrogen for 1 minute. The reactor was heated to 235\ufffd C. for approximately 5 hours. Upon cooling, the solution was nearly colorless and contained a white precipitate. The precipitate was separated from the liquid by placing the slurry into centrifuge bottles which were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes using an International Equipment Company Model EXD centrifuge, commercially available from Fisher Scientific Company, Pittsburgh, Pa. The liquid was decanted. Further purification of the particles was accomplished by resuspending the particles in a fresh portion of hexane and then centrifuging the slurry at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes followed by decanting the hexane. This purification was performed prior to using Test Procedures 8 and 9. The crystallite diameter and the percent crystallinity were determined by Test Procedures 8 and 9 with the results shown in Table 4. Using Test Procedure 8, the crystallites of the metal oxide particles were found to be tetragonal., 74155=Moist TiO2 particles (calculated as 2.28 grams of titanium dioxide) of Example 5 were transferred into a solution containing 40 milliliter of anhydrous 2-butanone, 0.21 gram of octadecyltrimethoxysilane, 0.14 gram glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, and 0.69 gram of 3-methacryloyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane. The slurry was stirred and then heated to 68\ufffd C. for 2 hours forming a translucent colloid. A dilute ammonium hydroxide solution was prepared by placing 8 drops of aqueous 30 percent ammonium hydroxide into 3.64 grams deionized water. Then 0.68 gram of dilute ammonium hydroxide was mixed with 3 milliliters of 2-butanone and added to the translucent colloid at a temperature of 68\ufffd C. to provide a transparent colloid. After reducing the temperature of the mixture to 45\ufffd C. and stirring the mixture for 12 hours, the mixture was concentrated until 2-butanone ceased to distill using a rotory evaporator (temperature 30\ufffd C.). Approximately 40 milliliters of hexane was added and the mixture stirred for 1 hour following the immediate precipitation of weakly flocced particles, forming a slurry. The slurry was transferred to centrifuge bottles, then centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes, followed by decanting the supemate and isolation of the particles. Further purification of the particles was accomplished by resuspending the particles in a fresh portion of hexane and then centrifuging the slurry at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes followed by decanting the hexane. The titania particles were dispersed in 30 milliliters of 2-butanone forming a transparent pale yellow, colloidal solution., 47831=Metal oxide particles of the present invention are described in part as having a particular absorptivity measurement when dispersed in an organic liquid. Metal oxide particles of the present invention, when placed in at least one of four organic liquids, must form a stable colloidal dispersion comprising a metal oxide content in the range of about 10 to about 35 weight percent. The organic liquid used to make a colloid for purposes of the absorption test procedure and for defining a characteristic of the particles of the present invention, is selected from the group consisting of heptane, xylene, toluene, and 2-butanone. After mixing one of these organic liquids with the metal oxide particles of the present invention, the mixture is centrifuged at 2500 revolutions per minute for 10 minutes using International Equipment Co., Model EXD, commercially available from Fisher Scientific Company, Pittsburgh, Pa., using rotor No. 259. After centrifugation, the samples are visually inspected for particle settling. Dispersions of metal oxide particles of the present invention are substantially free of particle settling and are thus considered to be stable dispersions. Only metal oxide particles that form stable dispersions in one or more of the four organic liquids are considered to be part of the present invention., 64090=In a nitrogen filled glovebox, 17.1 grams of hexanoic acid was added dropwise to 100 grams of tetrabutyl titanate. Outside of the nitrogen filled glovebox, 9.26 grams of deionized water was added to the solution, the solution was shaken vigorously for 2 minutes, then transferred to a 300 milliliter stirred pressure reactor (Pressure Reactor #4560, commercially available from Parr Instruments Co., Moline, Ill.) that was purged with dry nitrogen for 10 minutes. The liquid was heated to 250\ufffd C. (at a rate 5\ufffd C./minute) and stirred at 190 rpm under 37.4 atmosphere for approximately 5 hours. Upon cooling, the solution became nearly colorless with the formation of a white precipitate. The precipitate was separated from the liquid by first transferring the slurry into centrifuge bottles and centrifuging the bottles at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes using an International Equipment Company Model EXD centrifuge, commercially available from Fisher Scientific Company, Pittsburgh, Pa. After centrifugation, the liquid was decanted. Further purification of the particles was accomplished by resuspending the particles in a fresh portion of hexane and then centrifuging the slurry at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes followed by decanting the hexane. The percent crystallinity and crystallite diameter were determined by Test Procedures 8 and 9 with the results shown in Table 4. Using Test Procedure 8, the crystallites of the metal oxides were found to be tetragonal., 96034=The ceramer composition of Ceramer 6 was placed on a silicon substrate (commercially available from Monsanto, St. Louis, Mo.) between two 50 microns thick tape strips spaced 2 centimeters apart. The ceramer composition was spread between the silicon wafer and a polyester liner by pressing the assembly together on a flat surface with a 2500 grams steel coating bar. The polyester liner was removed by peeling and the film was cured on the silicon wafer as on the polyester substrates in Test Procedure 4. The cured film was then placed in an oven at 80\ufffd C. for 2 hours to drive off any residual 2-butanone., 69624=In a nitrogen filled glovebox, 20 grams of the barium titanium alkoxide slurry was transferred into a 40 milliliter screw cap jar. Outside of the nitrogen filled glove box, the barium titanium alkoxide slurry was mixed with 0.73 gram hexanoic acid and 0.395 gram of deionized water. The mixture was shaken vigorously for approximately 1 minute and then transferred into a 45 milliliter Teflon lined, non-stirred pressure vessel (Pressure Vessel Model #4744, commercially available from Parr Instruments Co., Moline, Ill.). The reactor head space was purged with dry nitrogen for 2 minutes. The reactor was then heated to 225\ufffd C. at 5\ufffd C./minute and the temperature maintained for 2 hours. The slurry was cooled and then poured into a centrifuge bottle and the barium titanate particles were separated from the liquid by centrifuging at 2500 rpm for approximately 10 minutes using an International Equipment Company Model EXD centrifuge, commercially available from Fisher Scientific Company Pittsburgh, Pa., 113794=Each particle sample was prepared as a 50:50 mixture by weight with tungsten metal and scanned between 20 and 52 degrees (2\u03b8) using a 0.05 degree step interval and 12 second counting time. Peak areas for the anatase (1 0 1), (1 0 3), (0 0 4), (1 1 2), and (2 0 0) maxima and tungsten (110) maximum were determined by profile fitting the observed data. A Gaussian peak shape model and linear background were employed for profile fitting. The ratio (Rexp) of anatase peak area (Aanatase) taken as the sum of the individual contributions indicated above, to tungsten (AW) peak area, were calculated for each unknown. A reference anatase standard, commercially available as Catalogue #23,203-3 from Aldrich Chemical, Milwaukee, Wis., was also scanned to provide a similar reference value (Rstd). The weight percent of anatase form in the crystalline metal oxide particles of the present invention were calculated by the instrument using the ratio of Rexp to Rstd as follows:, 78865=2.01 grams of oleic acid was rapidly added to 10 grams tetrabutyl titanate in a 20 milliliters screw cap glass vial and shaken vigorously for 2 minutes. To this liquid, 0.46 gram deionized water was added and the solution was vigorously shaken for one minute. The resulting liquid was transferred to a 23 milliliters Teflon lined, non-stirred, pressure vessel (Pressure Vessel Model #4749, available from Parr Instruments Co., Moline, Ill.). The reactor head space was purged with nitrogen for 1 minute, then the reactor was heated to 235\ufffd C. at a rate of 5\ufffd C./minute and held for 5 hours. Upon cooling, the solution was nearly colorless with a white precipitate. The precipitate was separated from the supernate by placing the slurry into a centrifuge tube, centrifuging the slurry at a speed of 2500 rpm for 10 minutes using an International Equipment Company Model EXD centrifuge, commercially available from Fisher Scientific Company, Pittsburgh, Pa. The absorptivity (a1) of the colloid was determined by Test Procedure 7 with the result shown in Table 3. Using Test Procedure 8 the crystallites of the metal oxide particles were found to be tetragonal., 111795=Each sample was prepared as either a dried ethanol slurry on a glass substrate or as a thin layer powder on double coated tape supported by a glass substrate. Survey step scans were conducted from 5 to 80 degrees (2\u03b8) using a 0.04 degree step interval and 4 second counting time. Identification of the crystalline phases of the metal oxide particles was achieved by comparison (as described in Harold P. Klug and Leroy E. Alexander, X-ray Diffraction Procedures For Polycrystalline and Amorphous Materials, John Wiley & Sons, New York 1954) of the observed diffraction maxima to the patterns present in the International Centre for Diffraction Data powder data file (International Centre for Diffraction Data, 12 Campus Boulevard, Newton Square, Pa.). The width of the anatase (1 0 1) maximum was determined by profile fitting using a Gaussian peak shape model and linear background. The apparent crystallite size was calculated using the Scherrer equation and the anatase (101) peak width after correction for instrumental broadening (as described in Harold P. Klug and Leroy E. Alexander, X-ray Diffraction Procedures For Polycrystalline and Amorphous Materials, John Wiley & Sons, New York , 1954, and P. Scherrer, G\ufffdttinger Nachrichten, 2, p. 98 1918)., 108451=An absorptivity test for colloids of Examples 3, 7, 9-11, and the ceramer composition of Ceramer 8 was developed to define some of the distinguishing features of the metal oxide particles of the present invention. The first step of the absorptivity test measures the dispersion stability or the relative resistance of particles to settling. Only colloids that are dispersion stable are part of the present invention and undergo a second test to determine the colloid light absorptivity. The absorptivity of the colloid was determined when the colloids included a metal oxide content typically in the range of about 10 weight percent metal oxide content to about 35 weight percent metal oxide content. The first step of the test was performed by taking 15 grams of a colloid (Examples 3, 7, 9-11), wherein the metal oxide particles were dispersed in either heptane, toluene, xylene, or 2-butanone and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes, using International Equipment Co., Model EXD, commercially available from Fisher Scientific Company, Pittsburgh, Pa., using rotor No. 259. After centrifugation, the sample was visually inspected for particle settling. If significant settling was observed, the sample was not considered part of the invention and consequently was not tested for light absorptivity. If the sample was substantially free of settling, the degree of transparency of the colloid was determined by measuring the optical absorptivity (a1) of the colloid sample. All light absorptivity (a1) measurements were made on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 19 Spectrophotometer using a 1 millimeter pathlength quartz cuvet. The instrument was standardized against the pure solvent, and the UV spectra were recorded in transmission (% T) at 650 nanometers. Percent transmittance readings were then converted to transmittance then to absorptivity (a1) as follows: a1=log10(1/T)/1c, where T is the transmittance expressed, 1 is the pathlength in centimeters, and c is the concentration of metal oxide in grams of metal oxide per gram colloid. The absorptivity value (a1) at 650 nanometers of each colloid, is reported in Table 3. Note that apparent emission, a negative value of a1 is possible due to the measurement conditions., 99329=The refractive index of approximately 25 microns thick layer of Ceramers 1-4 and 7 were determined. The ceramer composition was placed between two polyester liners having two 50 microns thick tape strips spaced 2 centimeters apart. The ceramer composition was spread between the polyester liners by pressing the assembly together on a flat surface with a 2500 grams steel coating bar. The film, in the presence of nitrogen, was cured at a translation speed of 20 feet/minute using a UV curing station (Model # MC-6RQN, commercially available from Fusion System Corp., Rockville, Md., with a \u201cD\u201d bulb). Upon curing, the refractive index of the film was determined using Aus Jena INTERPHAKO interference microscope. This microscope was commercially available from JENOPTIC JENA GmbH, Jena, Germany, and was used to measure optical path differences between adjacent materials. A Mach-Zehnder interferometer was used to shear and tilt a transmitted bright field image relative to itself. By overlaying the sheared image on the direct image, interference fringes were generated. Adjustments of the shear, tilt orientation, and tilt angle were used to orient and separate the fringes., 70968=The supernatant was decanted and the moist BaTiO3 particles were transferred into a glass vial containing approximately 20 grams of toluene and 0.51 grams of hexadecyltrimethoxysilane. The suspension was heated to 85\ufffd C. and stirred for 2 hours and a transparent colloid with a small amount of settled insoluble material was formed. The insoluble material was removed by filtration through a Gelman Acrodisc 0.45 micron polytetrafluoroethylene syringe filter, commercially available from Fisher Scientific Company, Pittsburgh, Pa. The dispersion was concentrated until toluene ceased to distill using a rotory evaporator. Approximately 40 milliliters of acetone was added to the syrup and the resulting mixture stirred for 3 hours following the immediate precipitation of weakly flocced particles. The slurry was transferred to centrifuge bottles and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes followed by decanting the supernate to isolate the particles. Further purification of the particles was accomplished by resuspending the particles in fresh portions of acetone and centrifuging the slurry at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes. The particles were isolated and dried under a vacuum at room temperature for approximately 12 hours. These particles were found to redisperse with mild agitation in heptane and toluene to provide high percent solids transparent colloids., 65707=In a nitrogen filled glovebox, 25.41 grams of 2-ethyl-hexanoic acid was rapidly added to 120 grams of tetrabutyl titanate. 13.0 grams of deionized water was rapidly added to the solution, the mixture was shaken vigorously for 2 minutes, then transferred into a 300 milliliter stirred pressure reactor (Pressure Reactor #4560, commercially available from Parr Instruments Co., Moline, Ill.) that was purged with dry nitrogen for 10 minutes. The liquid was heated to 220\ufffd C. and stirred at 190 rpm under 18.7 atmosphere for approximately 2 hours. Upon cooling, the solution became nearly colorless with the formation of a white precipitate. The precipitate was separated from the liquid by first transferring the slurry into centrifuge bottles and centrifuging the bottles at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes using an International Equipment Company Model EXD centrifuge, commercially available from Fisher Scientific Company, Pittsburgh, Pa. Further purification of the particles was accomplished by resuspending the particles in a fresh portion of hexane and then centrifuging the slurry at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes followed by decanting the hexane. The percent crystallinity and crystallite diameter were determined by Test Procedures 8 and 9 with the results shown in Table 4. Using Test Procedure 8, the crystallites of the metal oxide particles were found to be tetragonal., 85171=Example 5 particles (calculated as 2.28 grams of titanium dioxide) were added to 40 milliliters 2-butanone containing 0.69 gram C6F11CH2OC(O)(CH2)2S(CH2)3Si(OCH3)3 and 0.62 gram 3-methacryloyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane. The mixture was heated to 68\ufffd C. with continuous stirring for 1.5 hours. The mixture was combined with 0.68 gram of a dilute ammonium hydroxide solution (8 drops of aqueous 30 percent ammonium hydroxide mixed with 3.64 grams deionized water) and 3 milliliters of 2-butanone at 68\ufffd C. The temperature was reduced to 45\ufffd C. and the colloid stirred 12 hours. The transparent colloid was concentrated on a rotory evaporator under vacuum at 30\ufffd C. until the 2-butanone ceased to distill to form a slightly opaque syrup. Approximately 40 milliliters of hexane was added to the syrup and the resulting mixture stirred for 1 hour following the immediate precipitation of weakly flocced particles. The slurry was transferred to centrifuge bottles and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes followed by decanting the supernate. Further purification of the particles was accomplished by resuspending the particles in a fresh portion of hexane and centrifuging the slurry at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes followed by decanting the hexane. The titania particles were combined with 30 milliliters of 2-butanone., 89005=Example 5 particles (calculated as 2.28 grams of titanium dioxide) were added to 40 milliliters 2-butanone containing 0.35 gram 4,6-Br2 -2-C 4H9\u2014C6H2\u2014OC(O)(CH2)2S(CH2)3Si(OCH3)3 and 0.35 gram 3-methacryloyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane. The mixture was heated to 68\ufffd C. with continuous stirring for 1.5 hours. The mixture was combined with 0.35 gram of a dilute ammonium hydroxide solution (8 drops of aqueous 30 percent ammonium hydroxide mixed with 3.64 grams deionized water mixed with 3 milliliters of 2-butanone) at 68\ufffd C. The temperature was reduced to 45\ufffd C. and the colloid stirred 12 hours. The transparent colloid was concentrated until the 2-butanone ceased to distill using a rotory evaporator (30\ufffd C.). Approximately 40 milliliters of hexane was added to the mixture and stirred for 1 hour and following the immediate precipitation of weakly flocced particles. The slurry was transferred to centrifuge bottles and centrifuging the slurry at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes followed by decanting the supernate. Further purification of the particles was accomplished by resuspending the particles in a fresh portion of hexane and then centrifuging the slurry at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes followed by decanting the hexane. The titania particles were dispersed in 30 milliliters of 2-butanone forming a transparent pale yellow, colloidal solution., 46950=Colloids of the present invention are stable dispersions as measured by centrifuging the colloid samples at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes. Colloids (or sols), if substantially free of sediment after centrifugation, are said to be stable dispersions. Colloids of the present invention are stable dispersions and have an absorptivity measurement less than 3.0, preferably less than about 1.20. The colloids of the present invention may have an absorptivity measurement in the range of about \u22120.650 to about 3.00, and preferably in the range about \u22120.650 to about 1.20. The absorptivity of the colloids were determined when the colloids included a metal oxide content in the range of about 10 weight percent metal oxide content to about 35 weight percent metal oxide content as described in the absorptivity test procedure., 75923=In a nitrogen filled glovebox, 1.7 grams of hexanoic acid was rapidly added to 10 grams tetrabutyl titanate in a 20 milliliters screw cap glass vial and shaken vigorously. Outside of the nitrogen filled glovebox, 0.93 grams deionized water was added to the solution, the solution was vigorously shaken for one minute, then transferred to a 23 milliliters Teflon lined non-stirred, pressure vessel (Pressure Vessel Model #4749, commercially available from Parr Instruments Co., Moline, Ill.) that was purged with nitrogen for 1 minute. The reactor was heated to 220\ufffd C. (at a rate of 5\ufffd C./minute) for approximately 2 hours. Upon cooling, the solution was nearly colorless with a white precipitate. The precipitate was separated from the liquid by placing the slurry into a centrifuge bottle and by centrifuging the slurry at a speed of 2500 rpm for 10 minutes using an International Equipment Company Model EXD centrifuge, commercially available from Fisher Scientific Company, Pittsburgh, Pa., 94373=The metal oxide contents of Ceramers 1-7 as weight percentages were determined using a DuPont Instruments #2950 Thermal Gravimetric Analyzer. The weight percent of metal oxide in colloids and ceramer compositions of Ceramer 8 were measured by Test Procedure 2. A sample was heated to 200\ufffd C., at a rate of 10\ufffd C./minute, in air flowing at 60 cubic centimeter/minute and held isothermally for 30 minutes to determine the initial weight of samples following removal of water and other low boiling volatile components. Then the sample was heated to 900\ufffd C., at a rate of 20\ufffd C./minute, in air flowing at 60 cubic centimeter/minute to remove the remaining organic components and the percent solids as metal oxide determined by the Thermal Gravimetric Analyzer., 61835=In a nitrogen filled glovebox, 10.2 grams of hexanoic acid was added dropwise to 60 grams of tetrabutyl titanate. Following the addition of 5.56 grams of deionized water, the solution was shaken vigorously for 2 minutes, then transferred to a 300 milliliter stirred pressure reactor (Pressure Reactor #4560, commercially available from Parr Instruments Co., Moline, Ill.) that was purged with dry nitrogen for 10 minutes. The pressure reactor was heated at a rate of 5\ufffd C./minute until the liquid was heated to 225\ufffd C. The liquid was stirred at 190 rpm (revolutions per minute) under 20.4 atmosphere for approximately 2 hours. Upon cooling, the solution became nearly colorless with the formation of a white precipitate. The precipitate was separated from the liquid by first transferring the slurry into centrifuge bottles and centrifuging the bottles at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes using an International Equipment Company Model EXD centrifuge, commercially available from Fisher Scientific Company, Pittsburgh, Pa. After centrifugation, the liquid was decanted and the solid was transferred into a 1-liter round bottom flask containing 200 milliliter of anhydrous meta-xylene and 4.00 grams hexadecyltrimethoxysilane. The mixture was stirred forming a white slurry with uniform metal oxide particles. This slurry was heated to 90\ufffd C. for 1 hour to provide a transparent colloid. The transparent colloid was concentrated on a rotory evaporator under vacuum at 40\ufffd C. until meta-xylene ceased to distill providing an opaque syrup. The colloidal titanium oxide particles were precipitated by the addition of 500 grams acetone forming a slurry. The slurry was stirred for 1 hour, then transferred into centrifuge bottles and the solid separated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was decanted and the particles were dried under vacuum overnight. The particles were dispersed into heptane or toluene to provide a transparent colloid of high oxide content. Using Test Procedure 8, the crystallites of metal oxide particles were found to be tetragonal.}",
