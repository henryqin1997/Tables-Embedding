I'm Tom and I am a pretty awesome guy! I live in southern York county and work in Maryland. I couldn't ask for a better career, house, cars, all that good stuff...etc. I am healthy and energetic.

I do repair or rebuild anything and everything. I love my 20 yr old Jeep and a Porsche which l drive around",
