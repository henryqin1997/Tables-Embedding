Please adhere to this rule to avoid unnecessary trouble and considerably jeopardise future access and seriously piss off for the majority of the Gauteng climbing community. Sorry that ths is all so firm..but continued access depends on it. Anyone found to be not complying with the above will be banned from the property and should the access be closed down, will not be very popular! 7. The guard at the gate must check the date and number of people indicated on the reciept, it is in the interests of access that climbers remind the guard of this. 6. Officers at reception must ask for cards and check validity, it is in the interests of access that climbers remind the desk staff of this. 5.
