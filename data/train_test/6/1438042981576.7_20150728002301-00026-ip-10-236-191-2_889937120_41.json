            "The campus police patrol all the time, but they are SO GREAT. I'm not even kidding. My brother, some friends, and I will stay out late doing silly stuff or watching movies in the bible building. They always joke with us and are easy going as long as we're being responsible adults and not causing trouble.",
            "There are several clubs to be involved in and all of them are pretty cool. There's the artsy group, the jock group, the party group, the all-around nice guy group, etc. There's literally a club for everyone.",
            "Engineers and Bible Majors.",
            "The Clock Tower is a really cool, 100ft tower. We have a traditional lighting-of-the-commons were we turn on all the Christmas lights in the Commons.",
            "It's a great school for how little it costs. It's only $25,000 a year and that includes tuition, housing, estimated cost of books, and a regular meal plan.",
            "Ping-pong, pool, tennis, foosball, run the Eagle Trail, go swimming, watch movies, go down town, go to the mall, be involved in Spring Sing and theatre, go to on-campus concerts provided by the music department, etc.",
            "The cafeteria is terrible. Even the pizza sucks. However, you can get points for Chick-fil-a, Jimmy Johns, Alfredo's, and the grill. The grill and Jimmy Johns are right on campus and they are top-notch.",
            "I have a great living situation. I am with one of my best friends. The OC housing department is fantastic and will work with your situation (we changed our housing last minute and there was no problem). There are dorm praise sessions and meetings and everyone is very nice. I live in the cheapest housing and it's great.",
            "The classes, ESPECIALLY history classes, are difficult. The bible classes (excluding Greek and Hebrew) are a breeze, especially if you've been raised in the church. If you are a good student, you will do well. It's just about the same as anywhere else.",
            "Don't go here if: Good food is very important to you You aren't a Christian You are extremely concerned with graduating on time Go here if: You want a spouse You are planning on being an engineer or bible major You are from the Northwest You're born and raised in the Church of Christ",
            "OC is a great school for Engineers and Bible Majors. The professors, faculty, and fellow students are incredibly nice. Its major downfall is how late people tend to graduate."
