    "textAfterTable": "Even if Australia win the final on September 6, a loss against South Africa in their final round robin match next Tuesday does not look like it will be enough to keep the Proteas at bay. The ICC rankings system is often difficult to put into context. This is best evidenced by the fact South Africa has gone back to number one in Tests despite losing the mantle to the Australians when they suffered a crushing defeat in Cape Town in March. Australia has been overtaken without playing another Test since that date. However, to usurp its arch rivals in Tests and one-dayers would nonetheless ensure significant bragging rights for South Africa. Star batsman Faf du Plessis admits rankings points will be foremost on his team's mind when they clash with Australia in another round robin fixture on Monday at Harare Sports Club. \"It's important for us, I must say,\" said du Plessis. \"A lot of teams say the rankings don't mean anything to them, but for us it's very important. \"To be the number one Test team in the world is a huge honour for us and took a lot of hard work to get there. \"A year or two ago in the one-day set up we were mid-table, so we've worked so hard to get to number two and it's important to play our best cricket and try and knock Australia off that number one spot to be number one in that format.",
