            "Here is the official Event for the 2013 UK Seaside Photowalk. The official kickoff will be Saturday morning, probably around 9am. Then again, there will be people out much earlier to catch the sunrise, that's for sure. Please indicate whether you will be joining us, so we have a rough idea of how many people we can expect. Please note that this is not a confirmed booking or anything. Whoever shows up will be welcome. If you can join us only for one day, Saturday or Sunday, that'll be fine, too, of course. We'll make sure to announce tour details and meeting points in a few weeks. We hope to see you all there. And if someone has good connections to the weather gods, please let them know that we'd prefer the \"no rain\" option. Cheers Athena & Andy",

This shot was taken back in March one cold evening and it is of Balcombe Viaduct in East Sussex. A train goes over this bridge roughly once a minute as it is the mainline from Brighton to London.\ufeff___, 98466=2013-06-29 18:21:14 (22 comments, 0 reshares, 0 +1s)Open\u00a0, 122075=2013-03-22 18:16:30 (11 comments, 4 reshares, 43 +1s)Open\u00a0, 87928=2013-07-10 08:38:01 (32 comments, 4 reshares, 34 +1s)Open\u00a0, 73032=2013-08-05 14:51:28 (13 comments, 1 reshares, 28 +1s)Open\u00a0, 58656=2013-08-15 09:31:35 (9 comments, 12 reshares, 26 +1s)Open\u00a0, 128550=2013-03-04 17:54:32 (15 comments, 4 reshares, 73 +1s)Open\u00a0, 29434=2013-11-10 10:01:03 (4 comments, 5 reshares, 63 +1s)Open\u00a0, 75406=2013-08-03 13:29:24 (9 comments, 12 reshares, 79 +1s)Open\u00a0, 126613=Added photos to SmugMug Cover Photo Submissions For April.\ufeff___, 107836=2013-06-24 09:11:40 (31 comments, 9 reshares, 105 +1s)Open\u00a0, 134759=2013-03-02 19:46:39 (0 comments, 0 reshares, 1 +1s)Open\u00a0, 42460=2013-09-28 14:55:05 (24 comments, 3 reshares, 54 +1s)Open\u00a0, 36541=2013-10-05 22:41:53 (23 comments, 4 reshares, 82 +1s)Open\u00a0, 84997=2013-07-10 14:01:03 (11 comments, 0 reshares, 3 +1s)Open\u00a0, 33378=Evening G+! Here's another photo from the #dorsetphotowalk2013 \u00a0this time of Durdle Door at sunrise before the public and hoards of photographers descended ;) \u00a0Weather wasn't good and had to take shots in the rain trying my best to shelter the filters. \u00a0Took quite a few photos and glad I did as this was the only one without rain drops ruining the shot. Processed using Lightroom and Color Efex Pro 4.

There use to be a way using picasa web or picasa software for changing the album date so that it works with the default album sort (newest to oldest albums), but I can't find a way of doing this in picasa software. Googling returns loads of links from 2011 when this was possible. Cheers, Gez.\ufeff___, 38545=DISASTER!!! On the eve of the #dorsetphotowalk2013 \u00a0my tripod has only gone and broken for the second time in two weeks. \u00a0Except this time, I can't do a quick fix and it will be no good for the coming photowalk weekend. Sigh \u00a0:( I have an old tripod but it's incredibly primitive and only has 2 way movement. I'm thinking I can revitalise it though by getting a decent ball head. So, after a couple of hours of late night research I think I've settled on either the Giottos 1311-652, or for a few quid more the 1300-652 (which can take a greater weight; both get good reviews). Can anyone offer any wise words of wisdom on my ball head idea and/or the Giottos models before I (or more likely my wife!) make a quick dash for the camera shop tomorrow?
