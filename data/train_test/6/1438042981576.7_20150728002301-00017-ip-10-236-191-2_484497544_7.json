As can be seen, the collagen peaks at 1690 nm, 1725 nm, 2040 nm, 2170 nm or 2270 nm (4400, 4600, 4900, 5800 and 5925 cm\u22121) are repeated in the difference spectra of type II diabetics and non-diabetics. An increased absorption in the prevalent water region about 1425 nm (7000 cm\u22121) can be observed. It should be noted that while the 1920 nm (5200 cm\u22121) water band has similar information, the absorbance in that band is so great as to give a very low signal-to-noise ratio.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{73666=In another embodiment of the system, the light is encoded prior to interrogating the tissue. The spectrometer can be any device that encodes the wavelength information in the light entering the tissue interface. Exemplary devices are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/832,631, filed Apr. 11, 2001, entitled \u201cEncoded Variable Filter Spectrometer,\u201d incorporated herein by reference. Such systems can include stepped dispersive spectrometers or an encoded spectrometer such as a Hadamard transform device or an FTIR. Examples of suitable photo-detectors include photovoltaic detectors such as Si, InGaAs, InAs, Ge and InSe, photo-conductive detectors such as PbS and PbSe, and pyroelectric detectors such as DTGS and lithium tantalate., 47589=Thus, the light utilized can include at least one wavelength indicative of glycosylation end products which is evidenced at least in part by glycosylated collagen content in the tissue. Further, the resulting analyzed optical information or spectral data can also include information or a measurement of light from the at least one wavelength indicative of glycosylation end products, evidenced by glycosylated collagen content in the tissue. In one embodiment, the at least one wavelength indicative of glycosylated collagen content includes a wavelength selected from the following bands: 2240 nm\u20132300 nm, 2145 nm\u20132200 nm, 2025 nm\u20132060 nm, and 1670 nm\u20131745 nm., 36314=This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser.

Each of these related applications is hereby incorporated by reference., 74446=Since for many tissue test sites collagen is within 2 mm of the surface, the near-infrared light should be in a range of wave numbers that will penetrate tissue to that depth in order to interrogate the collagen containing tissue. Light having wavelengths in region from 1250 nm to 2500 nm (wavenumbers in the region from 8000 to 4000 cm\u22121) is suitable for analysis according to the present invention. Some sites that contain collagen within 2 mm of the surface include the underside of the forearm, the thigh, the calf, the back of the hand and the thenar., 37757=In 1997, it was estimated that 15.7 million people in the United States had diabetes, of which about 10.3 million were diagnosed and 5.4 million were undiagnosed. Due to the American lifestyle of poor diet and being overweight, the incidence of diabetes is becoming of epidemic proportions. Type II diabetes accounts for 90 to 95% of all cases of diabetes in the Untied States, making it and its attendant clinical and economic consequences a major public health problem. While the prevalence of diabetes in the Unites States is about 5% of the population, care for diabetes accounts for about 15% of health care expenses., 39824=In 1993, the ADA disseminated a questionnaire titled \u201cTake the Test. Know the Score\u201d. This questionnaire assessed both possible symptoms and historical risk factors. Points were given for certain responses; a score of less than or equal to 5 points was considered low risk for diabetes, and a score of greater than 5 points was considered high risk. Subsequent testing among both United States and United Kingdom populations found that the test performed rather poorly. Two years later, another questionnaire was developed in the United States with data from the Second National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey. A test of the questionnaire in the population from which it was developed found a sensitivity of 79% (i.e., 79% of the diabetics were identified as diabetics), a specificity of 65% (i.e., 35% of the non-diabetics were identified as diabetics), and a PPV (positive predictive value) of 10% (i.e., a positive indication from the screen means the subject has a 10% chance of actually having diabetes)., 98514=Any photodetector that satisfies basic sensitivity, noise and speed requirements can be used with the present invention. A suitable photodetector can have a shunt resistance greater than 6000 ohms, a terminal capacitance less than 6 nano farads and a minimum photosensitivity of 0.15 amps per watt over the 1.2 to 2.5 micron spectral region. In addition, the photodetector can have a cut-off frequency greater than or equal to 1000 hertz. The shunt resistance of the photodetector defines the Johnson or thermal noise of the detector. The photodetector's performance can be improved by making the Johnson noise of the detector be low relative to the photon flux at the detector. The terminal capacitance governs the cut-off frequency of the photodetector and can also be a factor in the high frequency noise gain of the photodetector amplifier. The photo sensitivity can directly impact the signal portion of the SNR equation., 104753=After converting the interferograms to single beam spectra, the embedded computer system can check the single beam spectra for outliers or bad scans. An outlier sample or bad scan is one that violates the hypothesized relationship between the measured signal and the properties of interest (i.e., glycosylated collagen measurement in human tissue). Examples of outlier conditions include conditions where the calibrated instrument is operated outside of the specified operating ranges for ambient temperature, ambient humidity, vibration tolerance, component tolerance, power levels, etc. In addition, an outlier can occur if the composition or concentration of the sample is different than the composition or concentration range of the samples used to build the calibration model. Any outliers or bad scans can be deleted and the remaining good spectra are averaged together to produce an average single beam spectrum for the measurement. The average single beam spectrum can be converted to absorbance by taking the negative base 10 logarithm (log10) of the spectrum. The absorbance spectrum can be scaled by a single beam spectrum to renormalize the noise. The resulting scaled absorbance spectrum can then have calibration maintenance and/or calibration transfer algorithms applied to it. Calibration maintenance techniques are discussed in detail below and in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/832,608, filed on Apr. 11, 2001, and entitled \u201cOptically Similar Reference Samples and Related Methods for Multivariate Calibration Models Used in Optical Spectroscopy\u201d, incorporated herein by reference. Calibration transfer techniques are disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/563,865, filed May 3, 2000, entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Spectroscopic Calibration Model Transfer\u201d, incorporated herein by reference., 72327=In one embodiment of the system, the spectral encoding is performed after light has interacted with the tissue. The light source can be an illumination device as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/832,586, filed Apr. 11, 2001, entitled \u201cIllumination Device and Method for Spectroscopic Analysis,\u201d incorporated herein by reference. Examples of light sources include tungsten filaments, QTH, glowbars or any continuous wave gray body sources. The sampler can include a blocker that separates the input light from the output light as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,230,034, entitled Diffuse Reflectance Monitoring Apparatus, and incorporated herein by reference. The spectrometer can be any device that allows the interpretation of the wavelength information from the modified light exiting the tissue interface. Such systems include Fourier transform infrared spectrometers, acousto-optical tunable filters, dispersive spectrometers utilizing a detector array, a stepped dispersive system with a single detector, and an encoded spectrometer such as a Hadamard transform device. Examples of suitable photo-detectors include photovoltaic detectors such as Si, InGaAs, InAs, Ge and InSb, photo-conductive detectors such as PbS and PbSe, and pyroelectric detectors such as DTGS and lithium tantalate., 71522=An apparatus for diagnosing or screening for diabetes incorporates an illumination subsystem which generates near-infrared light, a tissue sampling accessory which irradiates and collects light from tissue, a spectrometer, a data acquisition subsystem, a reference device for calibration maintenance, a processing unit, and calibration coefficients based on certain multivariate algorithms. Each subsystem has significant impact on the accuracy of the predictions of presence of diabetes mellitus. Examples of the first six subsystems suitable for the present invention are disclosed in detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/832,585, filed on Apr. 11, 2001, and entitled \u201cSystem for Non-Invasive Measurement of Glucose in Humans,\u201d incorporated herein by reference., 57461=Individuals who have been diagnosed with diabetes have an elevated level of glycosylated collagen and glycosylated collagen levels can be utilized as a distinct marker of long-term glucose control. Applicants have found that near-infrared spectroscopic techniques can be utilized with multivariate techniques to provide both screening and diagnosis of diabetes based on changes in the tissue associated with increasing levels of glycosylation end products such as glycosylated collagen. It is possible that, as collagen glycosylates, it unravels and cross-links which causes an increased level of scatter for light. The increased level of scatter results in more light returned, or in other words, less absorption of light. Also, glycosylated collagen directly absorbs light around several characteristic wavelengths. In the present invention, tissue can be irradiated with light having at least one wavelength that is indicative of glycosylated collagen content in the tissue (by increased scatter or by increased direct absorption). Multiple or groups of wavelengths of light which are indicative of level of glycosylated collagen are utilized. Suitable wavelengths include, but are not limited to, wavelengths selected the following bands: 2240 nm\u20132300 nm, 2145 nm\u20132200 nm, 2025 nm\u20132060 nm, and 1670 nm\u20131745 nm., 44843=The concept of using multivariate methods to classify elements into their parent populations was first put forward by Fisher in 1936. With the emergence of the computer in the 1960s, a number of authors proposed using different techniques for the computer diagnosis of disease. The techniques proposed included linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and logistic regression (LR). The diagnosis of diabetes using multivariate techniques was proposed by Gleser in 1972 where it was recommended to combine the OGTT results with other environmental factors such as age, sex, weight, etc.}",
