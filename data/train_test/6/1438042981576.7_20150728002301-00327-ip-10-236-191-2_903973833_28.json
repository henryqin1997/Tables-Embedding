            "Campus police can get anywhere on campus within 30 seconds. Paths are well lit, as well as parking lots with blue telephones to call police if you need help. At 11pm, four of the five entrances to campus are gated until 6am. They walk each on-campus living facility each night to ensure everybody is safe and they are always very quick to respond. The only down side is that you're not allowed to have pepper spray on campus. As a girl, this bothered me at first, but the campus is very safe, well lit, and you can always call an officer to walk with you if you're uncomfortable.",
            "There are a few fraternities and sororities here. They're not very large- scale but they have fun and do some great things around campus.",
            "Great for dedicated students who want to get out and try new things. A really good community is there that helps you develop into who you want to be as an adult.",
            "Campus is about 5 miles from where an atomic bomb was accidentally dropped. There's a decent sized crater and it's fun to go exploring there.",
            "FMU's tuition is seriously low for all the opportunities you have. There are tons of trips you can go on (mostly for free), clubs, events and activities you can participate in. Classes are great; your time will be taken with schoolwork but when you're free there's a good bit to do. In addition to all there is to participate in, FMU grants in state tuition to students who get $500+ in academic scholarships.",
            "There are tons of groups on campus and it's easy to get involved. Florence is situated about an hour from Myrtle Beach, 2 hours from Columbia and 2 hours from Charleston. It's right by I-95 and I-20, so everything is very accessable.",
            "The dining hall has a lot of monotony, but it's good food usually. It's nothing to write home about yet it's food. The Grille is the place to go if you have money to spend and want something really good. The only bummer is that the Grille isn't included in the meal plan.",
            "The dorms are okay. Usually four people share one bathroom and the rooms are kind of small. It's a quick walk to class and housing is really good about making you comfortable with the people you live with.",
            "There are some really easy classes and there are some really hard classes, it really depends on what your forte is and your willingness to apply yourself. Luckily the professors are very available and legitimately want to see you succeed and will do anything to help you.",
            "Since there's not a whole lot to do on campus, there is a lot of partying. Be careful! Even though it's college, underage drinking is really cracked down on if you're on campus (and it's illegal.) If you're not into partying though, there are a lot of people who don't go out who you can hang out with.",
            "I absolutely love this school. There are so many opportunities to travel and learn outside of the classroom. Professors are kind and very available to help you whenever you need it."

Tips for prospective students I've been told to not party too much and to always remember what I'm going to school to do. (Get an education). I'd say to everyone, it's your responsibility to get what you need done, but have fun while doing it Will enjoy being here I think I will enjoy being here. Everyone is so nice and very supporting. Will learn a lot The classes are all design to help us. If we need more assistance there is free tutoring services offered! I love that. Students should take advantage of this opportunity.
