            "At TMCC there are no dorms.",
            "The science classes that I have taken at TMCC are very challenging. You have to work hard and study a lot to get a good grade. In the end they are worth the time because you learn a lot.",
            "To succeed I think it is really important to pick something that you are passionate about. When you love what you do it is so much easier to care about studying and want to participate in class.",

Several web based classes online which is great for adult/non-traditional students. Cost of tuition per semester is very reasonable - four classes $1200., 329372=At only 1000 dollars a semester for a full load of classes plus books, this is the best deal out there. Some of our teachers even teach at the nearby university as well so you are getting the same education at a much lower rate., 366487=When I started college back in 2002, I think it was $150 for a 3 credit class. Now it is only 253.5 for a 3 credit class, which isn't bad compared to UNR., 216838=Read everything and call several times to verify that you have the correct information. On average you need to call three times to receive accurate information. If someone dies in your immediate family and you ask for a week breavement, please be aware that it is up to the teacher to excuse you, my sister died in a car accident in the middle of the 2011 Fall semester. Only one teacher let me make up the week of work I missed due to funeral services and dealing with her death. If you have received bad information, let someone know, write a letter, as often you will find the students working in the financial aid office are not informed and give out the wrong information.}",

Tips for prospective students Read the description of the class before you register for it. Listen to what other students say about teachers. See if you can figure out what teacher fits you type of learning because sometimes there is more than one teacher, but they teach differently. Register as early as you can to get the classes you want or need. Based on the teachers I have had so far, they are understanding and will try to help you as much as they can. Bang for the buck The pricing is not bad for a community college. I got a lot of knowledge out of it, and it is probably just as",
