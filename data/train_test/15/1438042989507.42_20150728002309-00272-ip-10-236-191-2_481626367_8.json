As recently as 1983, medical textbooks recommended surgery for removing impinging prostatic tissues and four different surgical techniques were utilized. Suprapubic prostatectomy was a recommended method of removing the prostate tissue through an abdominal wound. Significant blood loss and the concomitant hazards of any major surgical procedure were possible with this approach., 26469=This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/332,997, filed Nov. 1, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,733,315; which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Pat. No. 08/291,336, filed Aug. 17, 1994, now abandoned; which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/083,967, filed Jun. 25, 1993, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,391,197; which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/976,232filed Nov. 13, 1992, now abandoned. The Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/083,967 is incorporated herein for additional details regarding example delivery systems and ultrasound energy deposition techniques., 53522=where k is the tissue thermal conductivity, \u03c9 is the blood perfusion rate, cb is the specific heat of tissue, T is the tissue temperature and Ta is the arterial blood temperature. The steady-state solution to this equation was computed using the finite difference technique with successive over-relaxation. Typical values used were: \u03c9=5 Np m\u22121 MHz\u22121, k =0.528 W m\u22121\ufffd C\u22121, \u03c9=1-10 kg m\u22123 s\u22121, c=3680 J kg\u22121 \ufffdC\u22121, p=1000 kg m\u22123. A perfusion of \u03c9=2.0 kg m\u22123 s\u22121 represents a moderately perfused tissue (resting muscle); most tumors range from 0.1-5.0 kg m\u22123 s\u22121. These simulations were configured to accurately model the presence of applicator water cooling of the applicator/tissue interface. The acoustic force-balance technique adapted for cylindrical radiators was used to measure the acoustic output power from these tubular transducers as a finction of drive frequence and applied electrical power.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes While preferred embodiments have been illustrated and described, it should be understood that changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the invention in its broader aspects. Various features of the invention are defmed in the following claims. These results verified the usefulness of using the transurethral ultrasound applicator of present invention for thermal therapy of the prostate. These applicators, inserted within a water-cooled delivery-catheter, can produce heated regions extending more than 2 cm in radial depth, while sparing the urethral mucosa. A significant advantage of multi-transducer ultrasound applicators is that the longitudinal power deposition (heating pattern) can be dynamically altered in response to tissue heterogeneities, thermally induced changes in blood perfusion, and to tailor the size of the treated region. In addition, the beam distributions from these applicators can be shaped in order to produce desired circumferential or angular heating patterns which can protect the rectal mucosa while localizing the energy deposition to the anterior and lateral sections. This is a significant improvement over previous designs using single antenna microwave energy sources, which produce more elliptical or \u201cfootball shaped\u201d distributions which can not be adjusted. The in vivo thermal dosimetry experiments also show that therapeutic temperatures in excess of 80\ufffd C. can be obtained with the present invention. Finally, the applicator was repositioned to the initial startup orientation, and 8-10 acoustic watts of power was applied to each transducer in order to",
