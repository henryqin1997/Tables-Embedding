    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{156532=Perry was born in Pomona, California and played collegiate baseball at the University of Arizona. While at Arizona, he pitched alongside Tigers teammate Daniel Schlereth. Ryan Perry was drafted by the Detroit Tigers with the 21st overall selection in the 2008 Major League Baseball Draft.[2] On April 1, 2009 it was announced that Perry would make the opening day roster for the Tigers for the 2009 season.[3] On April 8, Perry made his major league debut against the Toronto Blue Jays. He threw a scoreless eighth inning in the Tigers' 5\u20131 victory.[4] On June 8, Perry was sent to the Toledo Mud Hens when Jeremy Bonderman came off the disabled list. He began the 2010 season as the middle relief pitcher for Detroit. He recorded his first career win May 1 against the Los Angeles Angels by pitching two-thirds of an inning. On June 10, Perry was placed on the 15 day disabled list with right biceps tendinitis.[5] After rehab in Toledo, he was called back up on July 3.[6] After starting the season with a 12.19 ERA through 13 appearances, Perry was optioned to Toledo on May 28, 2011 to make room for spot starter Andrew Oliver.[7], 86173=baseballdude, I have thought all along Nats will win 85-86 this season. In 2013 I expect 90, however these injuries this season i hope are not a bad omen for the future., 205639=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows.

Please, please, no extra innings!, 59726=Michele, I'm sweating this series and the early May series vs Phillies because they are significant tests for this Nats team. Is our pitching good enough to compensate for our below average offense? So far not so good. But Detwiler can be forgiven for that hanging curve to Ethier if Strasburg and Gio can deal this weekend. Not giving up on this game just yet, 33436=This team is going to be lucky to be .500 by June 1st. Very lucky. We have one of the worst offenses in the league and have played 4 or 5 of the worst teams in the NL and can only score 3+ runs a game. Have we even faced a top 40 pitcher yet??? Kershaw could get 20 K's tonight. I am so sick of this offense. Record setting pitching with record setting offense., 192549=Drew said\u2026 Well, Ross has a 1.64 ERA and we certainly can't complain about that. It's good to know we have our stopper on the hill tomorrow to right the ship (and help mix our metaphors.) April 28, 2012 1:02 AM _______________________________I don't know. Jury is still out. Today was a 4.50 ERA. He came back well after the 1st inning. Still good enough to win the game with some run support but lets face it, he had Kershaw on the other side., 101815=Actually, I don't think there's a single team in baseball that would have called Harper up before now. It was an absolute no-brainer to ensure team control for his age 25 season. Check that, it would have been flagrant baseball malpractice to do otherwise. But Rizzo's decision to bring him up now was gutsy and totally unexpected. We spent the last two days talking about options to improve our hitting \u2014 Tyler Moore (can he really play LF?), Corey Brown (he has options, right?), possible trades (is Span still out there? should we have gone for Marlon Byrd?), and the answer was staring us right in the face. We thought Rizzo went to Syracuse to see whether Tyler Moore was ready and it turns out he was assessing Harper. Amazing. Whatever happens, this year just got a lot more interesting. I can't wait to see what Rizzo decides once Morse is ready to come back if Harper is playing reasonably well and LaRoche is still hitting? Does Bryce move to CF? I'm sure that will be grist for a few 200 comment posts sometime in June.This Kershaw guy is pretty good\u2026., 22929=NatsBlog is optimistic based on sabermetrics:Clippard\u2019s FIP, or Fielding Independent Pitching, this year is an incredibly low 2.34 despite his astronomical 6.00 ERA. FIP basically tells you what a pitcher\u2019s ERA should be based on league average BABIP, timing, and home runs surrendered. FIP is a future predictor, which indicates Clippard\u2019s ERA stands to go way, way down.Clippard\u2019s SIERA, or Skill-Interactive ERA, is an above-average 3.72. SIERA is designed to be an even more accurate model of evaluating pitching than FIP, and FanGraphs describes it as \u201can attempt to more accurately model what makes a pitcher successful.\u201d While a bit higher than his FIP, Clippard\u2019s SIERA also indicates that he is set to improve drastically.Is anything wrong with Tyler Clippar?http://www.thenatsblog.com/2012-articles/april/is-anything-wrong-with-tyler-clippard.html}",
