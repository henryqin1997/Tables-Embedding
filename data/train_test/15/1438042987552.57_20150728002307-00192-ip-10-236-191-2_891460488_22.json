            "I never feel unsafe on campus. There are blue lights everywhere in sight, so even though I've never had to use them, I know that the campus police can be there for me in a matter of seconds. The only problem I can report is that there was money, video games, and a camera stolen in the dorms. However, as long as you keep your door locked at all times and keep your valuable items out of sight, you will be fine.",
            "Join a club! Not only will you make new friends because you share common interests or hobbies, you'll become a part of a family. Repertory Dance Troupe is one of my favorite parts about being on campus; I get to choreograph my own dances and have fun learning from my peers as well.",
            "The food doesn't match up to the cost, but when you take into account the amazing friends you'll make, the free social events and free food, and the interesting and engaging learning experiences, Eastern is so worth it.",
            "The Campus Activities Board (aka CAB) never fails to provide cool bands and other entertainment for the weekend. There are events almost every weekend. For instance, last semester they had a carnival, a 90's night, an arcade, a country night, and much more. Do NOT go home on the weekend; I promise, you will not be bored.",
            "The student center and library cafe provide pretty good meals, a variety of beverages, and other fresh items you would find in a grocery store. (You MUST try the smoothies!) However, I have nothing good to say about the dining hall. Although it's buffet style, I am often disappointed in the selection and the quality of the food. If the dining hall knows there are tours or other family events going on, the food is amazing. Making your own sandwich, waffles, and salad is your best bet here. Some of their soups taste deliciously homemade, too.",
            "Adjusting to having a roommate is a quicker process than what you expect, and you have plenty of opportunities to have the room to yourself as well. Everyone is very friendly and greets you, even if they don't know you. It isn't always easy if you have a loud roommate or a roommate who likes to party and stay out later than you. However, I think that Eastern matches people up pretty well. Some of the buildings are about thirty years old, but most of them are new and beautiful. Just bring a fan and be prepared for a nice bonding experience. Moreover, the Resident Assistants create activities each week to bring the whole building together, and there is always free food! It's a great way to meet new people.",
            "Although some classes weren't as challenging as what I expected, I feel that the academic rigor has gradually increased over each semester. Eastern presents their courses in a manner in which you can slowly adjust to the increased work load and develop good study habits. The professors are tough, yet understanding. They are certainly more than willing to answer questions and allow for democratic learning, so you are not overwhelmed.",
            "For prospective students, I would recommend coming to Eastern with an open mind and a smile because you'll make new friends and adjust quicker than what you think. Also, attend as many campus activities and events as possible because they are free and so much fun!",
            "Eastern Connecticut State University provides a welcoming and community-oriented environment. The professors, resident assistants, and other faculty members are dedicated to making you feel comfortable and helping you achieve success. With a small campus and a big heart, Eastern truly is home."

The short walk to Dairy Queen is always a favorite from September-November and April-May when the location is open. Year round activities include adventuring to Thread City for Breakfast, Cafe Mantic for lunch, The Brewery for Dinner, and A Cupcake for Later as a early dessert. All four places are located on Main Street. Plus a campus shuttle runs every evening Monday-Friday to Walmart and the East Brooke Mall., 260294=Eastern Connecticut State University is a great place to go to college! We're getting a new fine arts center in 2015 and I can really appreciate this as a music major-it means more practice rooms. It's gonna be awesome!, 207229=Here's a true police dispatch: On September 23rd at approximately 8:50 a.m., a female student was walking off campus in the Windham/Prospect street area. She was talking on a cell phone when she was approached by...An older white male [that] was driving the vehicle and he appeared to be wearing black eye under liner. He asked the student to call his mother and gave her the mother\u00e2??s phone number. She dialed the number she was given and then gave the suspect/driver her phone. The driver then left the scene with the student\u00e2??s cell phone heading toward campus. The student was not injured. Don't be stupid., 39283=The most unusual tradition is the Legend of the battle of the frogs.There are a lot of statues of frogs in town. The story is this: The town of Windham, next to Willimantic, in 1754 at the time of French/Indian war was over run with frogs. These frogs in the middle of the night made an overwhelming noise and everyone in town thought they were being attacked by the indians. The town sent three emmisaries to surrender only to find out that they were not being attacked by the Indians but rather were over run with frogs.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Get involved and stay for the weekends! There are so many fun things to do on campus which is a great way to meet people. Also, a little known fact about Eastern is that it is considered a suitcase school, meaning that many students go home for the weekend. But weekends are the best time to get work done and socialize! There are always events on campus for the weekends!! Bang for the buck Considering this is a state school and it is not too costly, the buildings, especially the dorms and library, are of very high quality. They are new and very up to date. Am enjoying being here I love the campus! It is small and you will know most of the people in your residence hall! There are always free activities on campus and plenty of clubs and sports, both intramural and varsity, to join. One of the downsides to the campus is that it is in the middle of Willimantic which is an urban city with little to do if you are not on campus. Am learning a lot All the classes are small and personal. The professors are very willing to help you, will",
