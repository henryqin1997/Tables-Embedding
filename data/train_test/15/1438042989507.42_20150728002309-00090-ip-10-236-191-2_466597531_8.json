    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While a preferred form of the present invention has been shown and described above, it should be understood that applicant does not intend to be limited to the precise form shown and described above. It should seen from an inspection of FIGS. 6, 7, and 8 that, as the valve core 52 is rotated within the valve body 50 from the full open position shown in FIG. 6 to a closed position shown in FIG. 8, the effective cross-sectional diameter of the passageway for fluent material will be progressively decreased by shifting the bottom 68b of the groove into the flow of the material. This provides more favorable flow characteristics than if a knife-edge were moved across a passageway for fluent materials. Thus, the valve of the present design operates in a very smooth way which does not distrub the pneumatic flow of the material to any degree as there is no interruptinq edge within the valve, and changes in the cross-sectional area of the passageway 80 are always progressive in all positions of the valve core. One of the reasons there is little disruption of the pneumatic flow of the material as the orifice valve varied is that the shape of the orifice at the narrowest point is smooth and rounded in all portions. Another reason is that the expansion after the narrowest point is achieved over a rounded body rather than a sharp recess",
