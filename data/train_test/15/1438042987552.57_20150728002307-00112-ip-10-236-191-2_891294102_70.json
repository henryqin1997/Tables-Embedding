            "This is a very lit up campus and the college police are consistently patrolling the grounds.",
            "Greek life prides themselves on their volunteer work and brotherhood/sisterhood. This isn't your traditional greek life, however strong friendship bonds are made by their members.",
            "Recreational sports are the largest activity groups on campus, comprising of most of the student body. This is a very active campus and our recreational center is always hosting league/tournament events for various sports.",
            "Athletic and enthusiastic individuals who enjoy trying new things, but escaping the big city feel.",
            "This isn't very expensive for a four year college compared to other schools within the state and has extremely high accreditation.",
            "The office of student life is always creating innovative ways of keeping the students occupied and enjoying life. There's something scheduled every weekend. The nightlife downtown is incredible as well. There won't be a dull moment unless you let it.",
            "They call it dorm food for a reason. That's exactly what it is. There are great off campus restaurants and numerous fast food locations around campus. This could be better, but certainly could be worse.",
            "All of the dorms are near each other. You can literally walk across campus in fifteen minutes. The majority of students are very approachable and campus student life is always creating new and innovative ways for on campus students to network and stay active.",
            "This is a very scientific school. The vast majority of the students are pre-med, pre-physician assistant, pre-PT, or are seeking various other degrees that will get them into graduate schools. Depending what major you choose, the difficulty increases significantly.",
            "This college is everything you will want and more. The students are down to earth and the professors are extremely approachable. However, make sure you prepare yourself for the course load while in high school, because it's no easy ride here.",
            "An excellent small college with fantastic educators. I can't say enough about the campus and how great of an education I am receiving here. The university is among the best in the midwest and will only continue to get better every year."

Always a great time!, 165207=I wasn't particularly fond of the food service for the 2011-2012 year, but Sodexo is the new company as of Fall 2012, which I hear is pretty great. The food service, however, is awesome. The employees are so very nice. I looked forward to getting my sack lunch from Theresa every other day!, 195637=Use the information given online and by academic advisers to find classes best for you. Also look at the online catalog of descriptions of classes to help chose ones you are interested in. The new scheduling system is so specific you can schedule to not have 7:45 am classes, which is very helpful., 2594=I will be a senior this at the beginning of the 2010-2011 academic year, and couldn't be happier with the college I chose! the classes are tough, obviously, but its so worth it. I am a chemistry major and mathematics minor, and i don't need to go to some big expensive private school to learn alot, I'm getting it done right here!, 351669=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 24986=Oktoberfest is a huge celebration every October in the La Crosse community. There are plenty of festivities including a parade, fair grounds, competitions, pageants, and much more., 37491=There are many clubs, organizations, sports and intramural sports to choose from. The campus offers lots of activities around campus, as well as guest speakers like Joe Biden who was here in October. La Crosse is also full of beautiful bluffs that you can climb!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here It is the perfect size school for me. It has about 10,000 students: not too small, not too big. The campus is small enough to walk end to end in 10 minutes. I am on the gymnastics team here and I love it! It's a great group of girls. The campus is very active. The Recreation Center is always busy and there are a lot of sports and Intramurals to get involved in. As soon as it gets warm out, people are doing things outside. The nature is beautiful. It is very common for students to hike the bluffs on the weekends for fun to see the beautiful view. Students can rent roller blades and take a trail by the marsh for recreation. There's always something to do or get involved in at La Crosse Am learning a lot The classes are challenging. It is more difficult than high school, but I would assume that most colleges are. Most class sizes are relatively small. My chemistry lab had only 18 students in it! The teachers are very helpful and want you to do well. They provide office hours, information about tutors, and are willing to meet with you if you need help. When I talk to students who are older than me, I can tell how much they have learned",
