Added back in id (with data value now) that is used for shop currency instead of material name. It caused too much confusion and broke support with many mods. Now all should be well. Some preparation in code for the big 1.5 update. v1.4.7 - Fixed major bug that caused all shops to be wiped on server reload or shutdown. Also made it so that people using buy shops can select the item they want to buy from people with the creative menu. (To do this, hit the buying shop with an empty fist.) v1.4.6 - Bug fixes. Fixed bug where amount of item in hand would be set to 1 when creating shop. Fixed bug where items could be picked up from chest when dropping a similar item on top of it. Fixed bug where more than one display item could be put on the shop. Fixed bug that would revert shops to selling shops even after they were declared as buying shops. Shop owners now see how many times their shop has been used by clicking on its sign. Added ClearLagg support. (ClearLagg plugin will no longer delete display items from the shops). Also added",
