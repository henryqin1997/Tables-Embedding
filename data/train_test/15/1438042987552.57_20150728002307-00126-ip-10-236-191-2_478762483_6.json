In the schematic presented in FIG. 9, which is one of many ways organizing the electronics contemplated by this invention, the data transmission lines 11 (typical) which are depicted by the hashed lines, are kept separate from the electric power lines 10 (typical) so as not to have electrical interference, either IF or electromagnetic, come in contact with and corrupt the digital data information. Electrical power can be supplied to the device via the power contact 1 which complete the circuit between the secondary transformer coils 2 and the primary coils of the interface wand 12 or via long battery life 3. The power is then transmitted to the logic chip 4 which acts to meter and distribute power to the optical eye 7, storage media device 6 and transponder 5. The logic chip 4 is connected to the storage media device 6 and is capable of sensing the flow of digital data to and from the storage media 6, determining the amount of data flowing to the device and preventing overloads, quality checking the data flowing to and from the storage media 6 to ensure the data is not corrupted, contains no electrical or RF interference, and is",
