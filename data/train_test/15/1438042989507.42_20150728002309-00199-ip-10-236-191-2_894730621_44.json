            "No greek life!",
            "Sports are big here! Espcially track and cross country! We are known for our running. DII Powerhouse!!",
            "Very diverse campus! People of all types!",
            "Adams State has a beautiful, small campus so getting around without a car is no problem. And if you want a bike but don't have one, those are available to rent cheaply too! Campus includes a big library, nice workout facility and an outdoor and indoor track for athletes. Campus also has a hang out area called the LOFT located in the sub building where games and other activities are located.",
            "Adams State is fairly affordable, especially if you are from the valley or have scholarships of some kind.",
            "Alamosa is a little town, so there are things to do, but most of the time you need to make your own fun! Which is okay too!! Dining downtown, a movie theater and outdoor activities are some of the favorites around town. But on campus you can usually find excitement going on.",
            "All you can eat!! There is usually something for everyone, and improvements to the menu have been made making healthy choices and vegetarian options more available.",
            "Nice size dorms and an enjoyable experience! Especially if in the 4 person suites!",
            "The classes are a good size and make for a good learning environment. The material is not hard, but can be if you do not keep on top of your work. It is important to learn how you learn and study best. Sometimes, you need to adapt to the way the teacher teaches as well.",
            "My biggest tip for prospective students would be to prioritize and focus on your school work as well as try new things! That is what college is all about. Challenge yourself to new levels and don't be afraid to grow and learn in all aspects of life.",
            "Adams State is a hidden treasure in Colorado. The school is a nice size, and has a lot to offer in terms of athletics as well as a variety of degrees for academic interests of all kinds. With the smaller class sizes and the very diverse student body, its hard to not feel successful, at home and comfortable in the beautiful San Luis Valley."
