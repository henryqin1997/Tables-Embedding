His hit rate was way out of line given his other numbers at Triple-A Tucson, so there's reason to believe he can be better this year. Additions to D'backs' staff squeeze him, so look for him in July, rather than April., 45843=2004, 45508=Nippert underwent Tommy John surgery in July 2004, so he won't be pitching again until mid-summer at the earliest, and the D-Backs will certainly treat him with kid gloves. He won't be a roto factor this year, but he easily could be in 2006, so don't vote him off the island completely., 39382=8/11/2010, 32660=Age is determined on July 1st of each season. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jump To:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25b2 Basic Stats \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25b2 Split Stats, 14614=Age is determined on July 1st of each season. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jump To:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25bc Advanced Stats, 38419=8/24/2010, 44748=Nippert made a resounding recovery from Tommy John surgery last year. He was arguably the best pitcher in the Double-A Southern League and then turned in a nice three-start cup of coffee for the parent club in September. Nippert will be given every chance to nail down a role in the major league rotation in the spring. It's tough to fully endorse a rookie pitcher in Arizona's ballpark, and after all, Nippert has thrown barely 250 professional innings in his career (less than 15 above Double-A). He could have a tough year if he sticks with the D-Backs for most of 2006, but in keeper leagues, you've got to hang on to Nippert because he's got huge upside., 41350=7/20/2010, 37426=8/25/2010, 45895=Nippert had a great half-season in high Single-A in 2003, especially impressive when you discover that he had to take two months off in midseason due to a benign tumor in his shoulder that required surgery. He'll start 2004 at Double-A El Paso, and if he stands tall there, could be in Arizona by mid-2005., 40400=8/5/2010}",
