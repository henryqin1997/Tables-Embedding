The victory is the 18th in a row for the Jumbos, who improve to 8-0 overall and 5-0 in the league. They were led by four goals each from senior Ryan Molloy (Setauket, NY) and Sean Kirwan (Boonton Township, NJ). Bates, which scored a flurry of goals early in the second half to make it interesting, lost their second straight and fell to 4-5 overall and 1-4 in NESCAC. Sophomore Gary Guinta (Bay Shore, NY) scored four times for the Bobcats. Kirwan and Molloy both scored twice as the Jumbos raced to a 7-0 lead after the first quarter. Both then scored early in the second period as the Tufts advantage was extended to 10-0 after Molloy's goal at 11:19. Bates broke up the run with their first goal at 2:19 of the second quarter, scored by senior Luke Charest (Freeport, ME). While the Jumbos were dominating offensively in the first two quarters, they were also getting strong play at the other end from freshman goalie Patton Watkins (Chattanooga, TN). He stopped eight of the nine Bobcat shots on goal in the first half. Junior face-off man Nick Rhoads (McLean, VA) won eight of 12 for Tufts in the first half. After the teams traded goals early in the second half, Bates captured the momentum with four straight goals to make it an 11-6 game with 6:59 remaining in the third. Guinta scored twice during the four-goal surge and Charest had three assists. Consecutive goals by senior Matt Witko (Chappaqua, NY) and Kirwan put the Jumbos back in charge at 13-6 late in the third. Tufts then scored the first three in the fourth quarter to go up 16-7 on the first collegiate goal by freshman Peter Bowers (Contestoga, PA). Charest picked up his fifth assist of the game on the Bobcats' final goal scored by freshman Wylie Leabo (Belmont, MA). Watkins finished with 16 saves before he was relieved late in the game. Rhoads won 17 of 28 face-offs, while Molloy's five ground balls were the Tufts team-high. Senior D.J. Hessler (Monkton, MD) had three goals and three assists, while Witko finished with three goals and an assist. Face-off wins by senior Cody Newman (Montclair, NJ) were the catalyst to the Bates third-quarter run. He finished with nine wins. Junior Reed Brown (Portsmouth, NH) collected six ground balls, while junior Kevin Helm (Norwell, MA) and freshman Paul Donovan (Norwell, MA) both had five. Charest was the Bates scoring leader with six points. Junior goalie Adam Scharff (Glyndon, MD) made six saves. Tufts travels to Trinity for a battle of NESCAC unbeatens on Saturday with a 1 pm start. Bates hosts Connecticut College on Saturday at 1 pm.}",
