(x) After hardening the printing matter prepared by said ink composition by irradiating UV rays, the print surface of the printing matter was tested by scratching with a pencil of the hard level B, and as the result, the print surface was deeply flawed, or detached, or the microcapsules were left out. Or the hardening itself was not sufficient, and therefore, the adhering property was shown or the hardening was not attained. (\u0394) After hardening the printing matter prepared by said ink composition by irradiating UV rays, the print surface of the printing matter was tested by scratching with a pencil of the hard level B, and as the result, a little flaw was observed on the print surface, or a part of only the surface layer was detached, or the surface gave a gritty feeling.
