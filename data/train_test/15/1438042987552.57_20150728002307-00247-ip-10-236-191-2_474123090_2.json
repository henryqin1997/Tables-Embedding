Having featured at the top of timesheets during the early Soft tyre runs, Grosjean's accident came when he switched to the Super Soft rubber, with the former GP2 Champion admitting that he simply misjudged his braking and entry speeds. \"After a great start to the day it was a real shame to end things early,\" said Grosjean, who wound up seventh despite missing out on almost an hour of running. \"I didn\u2019t have the grip I expected going into the corner, but there was nothing wrong with the car; my braking and entry speed were all wrong and I ended up hitting the barrier. \"There was no chance to let off and go straight on into the runoff area; I was committed to the corner so that was it. We have a very good car here and it gives you the confidence to push, but unfortunately I pushed a bit too hard. I\u2019m sorry for the team and I definitely owe them all a drink for all the work that\u2019s needed before Saturday.\" The Frenchman added of his chances: \"The grid looks very close, but we seem in good shape and I\u2019m eager to get back out on track and fight for the top positions.\" Team-mate Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen went on to finish the opening day sixth quickest., 14582=Monza has a \"90 per cent\" chance of remaining on the Formula 1 calendar beyond 2016, according to Roberto Maroni, the President\u2026, 29815=Felipe Massa has described Williams' second non-scoring weekend of the 2015 season as \"a blow\" to the team's championship\u2026}",
