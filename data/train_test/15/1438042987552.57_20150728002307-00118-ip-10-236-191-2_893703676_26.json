            "The cafeteria for students on campus is not that great but only option. A few good dining places, pizza, Mexican, sushi, Chinese, fast food.",
            "They only clean the dorm suites once every few weeks, once it gets too messy they will not help clean. Small older dorms but the newer ones are nicer if you can get into one, or off campus apartments.",
            "Some students try very hard and study but others will do drugs and just get by. The art program is good as well as business and education.",
            "Come to SUNY New Paltz if you want to experience a unique town if you want to relax and be in a good environment to learn and make new friends.",
            "It's a pretty good school for between Albany and New York City. The teachers and students are mostly friendly kind. I like the small campus and the close community you get."

There are great tours, and if you apply and get accepted there is an accepted students tour in April (which I attended last year and where I fell in love with the school)., 9679=I am enjoying New Paltz, for the most part. However, being a transfer student is a very unpleasant experience. First of all, there is no on campus housing if you transfer from another school. You have to find your own apartment or commute from home if you live close enough. Second, making my schedule at orientation was a nightmare. The majority of the classes had filled and there was no one on one advising. It was hard to know exactly what you needed to take, and even if you did know, the class probably was full. They were able to put me in some full classes, but they will not do that for certain courses, such as Psychology courses. Also, parking for commuters is much further than parking for residents and faculty/staff. The people here are very friendly, and there is a 2:1 ratio of residents to commuters, so fitting in is not extremely hard. The professors and staff are also very helpful., 264864=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 76433=VISIT!!! I know way too many people who just signed up to attend a school for 4 years without knowing what they were signing up for. these are often the people who end up needing to transfer or don't get what they want or need out of their college experience. This is your life. Be as involved in the process as you can afford to be. And something more specific to New Paltz is APPLY EARLY TO AVOID BEING TRIPLED. I applied in October for Early Action, which is non binding. This guaranteed that I would only have to share a room with one other person, as opposed to being tripled, which is when they have 3 people living in a room intended for 2 people (Theres 3 beds though! and it costs less money)}",

I have to drive 40 minutes every morning because they don't offer any campus housing for us. The commute also makes it much easier to miss class when things like blizzards come in to play. New Paltz seems to not care about it's transfer students. Tips for prospective students My suggestion is that if you plan on being a transfer student, apply early and MAYBE you can get a dorm, if that is what you wish to do. Also, make sure you go into orientation knowing what you need to take for the most part. As far as freshman go, I think you will have a very good time if you can live on or close to campus. Bang for the buck SUNY New Paltz was rated 36th out of 100",
