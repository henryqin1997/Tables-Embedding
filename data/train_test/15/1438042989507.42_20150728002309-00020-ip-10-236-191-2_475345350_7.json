These rolls are available from New Departure Hyatt Bearings, Sandusky, Ohio. The turbines are supplied with air from separate sources of pressurized air, the turbine air for each turbine being fed through a nozzle having a throat diameter of 0.063 inch. Each nozzle diameter increases near the exit in a region beginning 1/16 inch from the nozzle exit and extending to the exit in the form of a segment of a 16\ufffd cone. The nozzle is positioned adjacent the turbine and aligned so that the following approximate relationships are obtained with no yarn on the roll., 23820=According to one of its broadest aspects, the invention comprises a process of melt-spinning nylon 66 comprising extruding nylon 66 polymer of fiber-forming molecular weight as a plurality of molten streams, solidifying the streams into solid filaments while withdrawing the filaments from the streams at a speed of at least 2285 meters per minute and sufficiently high to provide a tension within the range between 0.2 and 1.5 grams per final denier, (the denier of the yarn on the bobbin) maintaining the filaments under a tension within this range while forwarding them at least 0.16 and less than 0.11 seconds (preferably between 0.03 and 0.06 seconds) after solidification to a treatment zone wherein they are heated to between 50\ufffd C and 250\ufffd C for a period sufficient to reduce the yarn retraction to less than 1%, and withdrawing the filaments from the treatment zone., 59439=This representation has been reported to be satisfactory in many cases by Dumbleton et al [J. H. Dumbleton, D. R. Buchanan, and B. B. Bowles, J. Appl. Polymer Sci., 12, 2067-2076 (1968)]. The shape of the peak is then given by a single factor, such as the peak width at 1/3.8 height, related to h by,, 60418=Crystalline orientation of the molecular chains is obtained following Wilchinsky's general treatment (Z. W. Wilchinsky, Advances in X-Ray Analysis, Vol. 6, Plenum Press, New York, 1963, pages 231-241. Described by L. E. Alexander, X-Ray Diffraction Methods in Polymer Science, John Wiley, 1969, pages 245-252). The equatorial (010) and (100) orientations are found to be similar, indicating near randomness about the C-axis; so the molecular chain or C-axis orientation simplifies to, 17485=This is a continuation-in-part of our copending application Ser. No. 482,962, filed June 25, 1974, and now abandoned., 40443=After stripping sufficient yarn to eliminate any surface defects (a minimum of 25 meters) on the bobbin, a skein of yarn is wound on a Suter Silk Reel, Singer Reel or equivalent which winds 1.125 meters of yarn per revolution. A sample having a weight of 1.125 grams is wound, removed from the reel and the ends of yarn are tied together. Winding tensions are 2 grams maximum up to 400 denier, 6 \ufffd 2 grams for 400-800 denier and 8 \ufffd 2 grams for 800-1700 denier. A No. 1 paper clip (weighing approximately 0.51 grams) is attached to the skein in a manner to encompass the full filament bundle. The skein is then hung over a one-half inch diameter stainless steel rod which is then placed in front of a shrinkage measuring board (a precision chart to determine sample length). A 1000 gram weight is attached to the paper clip and after a 30-second wait, the sample length (Lo) is determined. Care is taken to eliminate parallax errors in reading sample length., 45726=Retraction is measured within 28 hours after the yarn is produced. A minimum of 1000 yards is stripped from the freshly wound bobbin. A skein of yarn is then wound on a Suter Silk Reel or equivalent, which winds 1.125 meters of yarn per revolution. A sample having a weight of 1.125 grams is wound, removed from the reel and the yarn ends are tied together. Winding tensions are 2 grams maximum up to 400 denier, 6 \ufffd 2 grams for 400-800 denier, and 8 \ufffd 2 grams for 800-1700 denier. A No. 1 paper clip (weighing approximately 0.51 grams) is attached to the skein in a manner to encompass the full filament bundle. The skein is then hung over a one-half inch diameter stainless steel rod which is then placed in front of a shrinkage measuring board (a precision chart to determine sample length). A 1000 gram weight is attached to the paper clip and, after a 30-second wait, the sample length (Lo) is determined. Care is taken to eliminate parallax errors in reading sample length., 55556=These samples are made using an identical polymer type, conventionally spun. The spun yarn is steamed prior to being wound on a conventional spin bobbin at 1463 meters/minute. The spin bobbin is then lagged for 2 days in an air atmosphere at about 23\ufffd C. and 70% relative humidity. A length of yarn is cut from the bobbin after stripping about 100 yards of surface yarn., 18440=One prior art process for making nylon 66 yarn is the conventional melt spinning process wherein the spun yarn is collected on spin cakes or packages, the spin cakes then being removed from the spinning machine and placed on drawing machines where the drawing operation is performed. By way of example, split process spun yarn having 188 denier can be collected at 1500 y.p.m., corresponding to a throughput of of 28.7 grams per minute per spinning position. This spun yarn is then drawn to 70 denier on a separate machine. Productivity per spinning position is thus reasonably high, but the discontinuous or split process is expensive because of the necessity for manually handling the spun yarn, and the drawn yarn properties are somewhat variable., 34213=The reported tensions are as follows: t1 is measured downstream of roll 38, t2 is measured between device 46 and roll 38, t3 is measured as the yarn leaves chamber 32, t4 is measured between roll 30 and chamber 32, t5 is measured between rolls 28 and 30, t6 is measured between roll 28 and finish roll 42, and t7 is measured just above roll 42. A Rothschild Tensiometer Model R1092 is used for measuring all tensions., 41432=The 1000 gram weight is removed and replaced with a 284 gram brass weight; this weight is not removed until the final length measurement is to be made. The rod, the skein of yarn and the attached 284 gram weight is suspended (with the weight applying full tension) in a vigorously boiling covered water bath for 10 \ufffd 2 minutes. The rod with its associated yarn skein and weight is removed and excess water allowed to drain (2-3 minutes). Then the samples are placed in a forced draft oven in such a manner that they remain under full tension for 15 minutes. The oven temperature is controlled at 115\ufffd \ufffd 5\ufffd C. The rod and its associated weighted skein is removed from the oven and returned to the shrinkage measuring board where it is allowed to hang for a minimum of 10 minutes (but no greater than 30 minutes). The attached 284 gram weight is removed and replaced with the 1000 gram weight, and 30 seconds thereafter the final length (Lf) is measured. The shrinkage (S) is then calculated as follows: ##EQU1## If nine consecutive samples are measured the average shrinkage level of the yarn on the bobbin at 95% confidence will be within \ufffd 0.24 of the true value., 46736=The 1000 gram weight is removed and the sample is allowed to hang for 24 \ufffd 0.1 hours. The 1000 gram weight is attached to the paper clip and 30 seconds thereafter the final length (Lf) is measured. The percent retraction (Sr) is then calculated as follows: ##EQU3##}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes Yarns according to the invention accordingly have unique and desirable combinations of physical properties, which combinations are not present in the prior art. The polymer contains 0.5% TiO2 by weight and is selected so that the resulting yarn will have a relative viscosity of about 38-40. Quenching conditions are the same as above except that the average velocity of the quenching air is 57.5 feet per minute. In the FIG. 5 apparatus, the distance from spinneret 22 to finish roll 42 is 215 inches, while the distance from finish roll 42 to roll 34 is 17 inches. Quench zone 24 has a height of 46 inches. The broadest aspects of the process are illustrated in FIG. 5, wherein yarn 26 has finish applied by finish roll 42, then passes in seven wraps around heated roll 34 and its associated separator roll 36. Roll 34 has a diameter of 6 inches and is operated with a surface temperature of 155\ufffd C. Roll 36 has a 2 inch diameter, and is located such that when roll 34 has a peripheral speed of 4029 yards per minute, yarn 26 will have a total residence time in contact with roll 34 of 31.4 milliseconds. Experimental Items R and S, which do exhibit the desirable positive values for the stress index \u221d, couple this with shrinkages as high as tire yarn and low final moduli. None of these items have",
