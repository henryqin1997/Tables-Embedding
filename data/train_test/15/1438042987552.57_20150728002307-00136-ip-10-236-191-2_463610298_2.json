    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{91762=This gene encodes an enzyme involved in catalyzing the conversion of angiotensin I into a physiologically active peptide angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent vasopressor and aldosterone-stimulating peptide that controls blood pressure and fluid-electrolyte balance. This enzyme plays a key role in the renin-angiotensin system. Many studies have associated the presence or absence of a 287 bp Alu repeat element in this gene with the levels of circulating enzyme or cardiovascular pathophysiologies. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified, and two most abundant spliced variants encode the somatic form and the testicular form, respectively, that are equally active.

ACE_HUMAN,P12821 UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Function: Converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II by release of the terminal His-Leu, this results in an increase of the vasoconstrictor activity of angiotensin. Also able to inactivate bradykinin, a potent vasodilator. Has also a glycosidase activity which releases GPI-anchored proteins from the membrane by cleaving the mannose linkage in the GPI moiety ACE_HUMAN,P12821 UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot EnzymeRegulation: Strongly activated by chloride. Specifically inhibited by lisinopril, captopril and enalaprilat ACE_HUMAN,P12821 UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot CatalyticActivity: Release of a C-terminal dipeptide, oligopeptide- -Xaa-Yaa, when Xaa is not Pro, and Yaa is neither Asp nor Glu.",
