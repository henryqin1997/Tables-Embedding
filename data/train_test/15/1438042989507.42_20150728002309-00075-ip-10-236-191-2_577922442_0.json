    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{212489=In 1989, a plasmid-based gene knockout method was developed in Escherichia coli that is achieved through two recombination events (i.e., integration and resolution) [6]. A plasmid carrying a replacing gene fragment containing homologous ends is integrated into a target gene locus through homologous recombination. To this end, the replacing gene fragment is cloned into a plasmid containing a temperature-sensitive replication origin, pSC101ts, which replicates at low temperatures (e.g., 30 \u00b0C), but not high temperatures (e.g., 43 \u00b0C ; Step (a) in Figure 1). Using the plasmid, E. coli is transformed and colonies are selected at a permissive, low temperature in the presence of the appropriate antibiotic. Transformants are then transferred to fresh medium and grown at a high temperature to prohibit self-replication of the plasmid. By selecting transformants in the presence of the antibiotic, the modified genomic fragment harbored on the plasmid is forced to integrate into the targeted genome locus through homologous recombination (Step (b) in Figure 1). After integration, the second recombination event takes place; resolved (disintegrated) progeny is selected at low, permissive temperatures at which the plasmid is able to replicate. During the resolving step, the specific region between the homologous sequences is deleted from the genome (Step (c) in Figure 1). This approach has been successfully applied to replace the bolA gene in the E. coli genome. However, the frequency to obtain the desired clone (\u201chit-rate\u201d) was rather low and thus labor-intensive, especially at the resolution step [6]. It was hence improved by adding a counterselective marker gene onto the vector. The marker was a sucrose-sensitive suicide sacB gene of Bacillus subtilis; recombinants carrying the gene cannot grow on sucrose-containing plates, which are effective for the enrichment of clones lacking the gene during resolution. This improved method has been applied to various bacteria, including E. coli [6\u20139], Myxococcus xanthus [10], Corynebacterium glutamicum [11], Rhodococcus spp. [12], and Pseudomonas putida [13]., 164524=We thank the members of our research group for their assistance.
