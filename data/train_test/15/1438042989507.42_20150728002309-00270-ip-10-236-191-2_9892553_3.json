Specifically, this database will:, 13327=Nottinghamshire County Council Environment Department, Trent Bridge House Fox Road, West Bridgford Nottingham NG2 6BJ Tel: 0115 977 2116, 7440=The resources at the heart of this project are the substantial volume of published sources, including books, journal and web-articles detailing the archaeology of the Trent Valley, that exist either at a regional, local or artefactual level. Bibliographies of aspects of this material already exist in academic literature. Synthetic regional treatments such as those published as part of The English Heritage East Midlands Archaeological Research Framework Project and Knight & Howard 1994, Archaeology and Alluvium in the Trent Valley, for example, have provided important introductory bibliographies of archaeological research within the area. Similarly, SMR databases commonly cite bibliographic references as part of the monument recording process, but these, by their very nature, tend to be geographically-circumscribed datasets relating to only part of the Trent Valley area., 3380=The River Trent is 280km long, rising on Biddulph Moor in North Staffordshire and running east and northwards to the Humber. Trent Valley 2002 takes the whole floodplain of the Trent Valley and its major tributaries as its geographical focus. Within the use of the Bibliography an area described by 88 parishes dissected by this floodplain is taken as the geographical limits of recorded data. These parishes are listed in Appendix 1. No temporal end-points to archaeological data were introduced, though for the practical purposes general surveys of post-medieval and twentieth-century historical, cultural and/or political development were not comprehensively searched or entered. Reports and volumes published up until July 2003 (or up to the date of SMR visitation, Table 2) were entered, though necessary omissions to recent, post-c.2001, interventions were imposed when reports were still active in the planning process.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{22790=A summary of these data sources show that of the 4,202 references entered, interventions in Nottinghamshire, perhaps unsurprisingly, considerably outweigh those in other regions, making up nearly 43% of 'grey literature' sources, and 41% of other references; with interventions in Staffordshire and Derbyshire next common. This is roughly comparable with figures comparing the size of the Trent Valley 2002 Project area within each of these counties; with Nottinghamshire comprising 35%, and Staffordshire and Derbyshire c. 16% respectively (Baker 2003, 24). Of note is the dearth of 'grey' literature from North Lincolnshire, which at c.7% of the total stands in some contrast to the nearly 148.2 km2 area making up c.22% of the Trent Valley; although it is assumed that many of the published sources for North Lincolnshire have been subsumed within volumes assigned to 'Lincolnshire' or 'Multi-district'., 32469=This project was part of the Trent Valley GeoArchaeology 'Trent Valley 2002' project, funded from the Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund administered by English Heritage. Further information on Trent Valley 2002 can be seen at: http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~aczkdc/TVG/, 23709=In most cases it was possible to identify c.90-95% of these reports either in County SMRs, via AIP references or directly from source contractual units. However, on average a shortfall of around 30% was recognised between reports produced, and cited independently via either the AIP, the English Heritage Excavation Index for England, or by field-work practitioners, and actually archived in the relevant SMRs. In order to address this imbalance the TVGAB was granted a months extension at the end of 2003 to continue the programme of re-identification by contacting contractual units directly. As a result of this extended programme an overall success rate of nearly 90% across published and unpublished works had been achieved two weeks before completion of the project (Table 5)., 32807=AACR2.

    "textBeforeTable": "Data standards Content and structure [back to top] Currently no procedures are in place to allow for the revision of the TVGAB dataset, nor to supplement the dataset with annual updates. Whilst many of the citations derive from these original sources, all included data has been modified: firstly, to fit the TVGAB field structure, and secondly, in the addition of classification criteria outlined in the section on Data Standards. Transcripts of original material which do not fit the data structure, including abstracted information, have been retained within the 'Further information' memo field. This data has not been comprehensively edited and often includes data artefacts from these originating sources. As it was felt that this information could aid the re-identification of sources (often data includes page numbers, interpretative information, report format, etc.) it has been retained unedited in the TVGAB. Both the citation and abstracted information is wholly in the public domain. International Standard Book numbers (ISBN), International Standard Series numbers (ISSN) are used where these have been identified Staffordshire SMR event codes are recorded as supplied, e.g. Staffs SMR ST758 Humberside and North Lincolnshire SMR Source codes are recorded as supplied, e.g. Humbs SMR HU896, North Lincs SMR source LS7549 Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Lincolnshire SMR unique report identifiers are prefixed by R (for 'report', to distinguish these from identifiers relating to monument identifiers or other sources), i.e. Nottingham SMR report number 125 - is - Notts SMR R125 English Heritage Excavation Index for England data",
