Meanwhile, the Feb manufacturing PMI reported by the National Bureau of Statstics fell by -0.3 points to 50.1 from 50.4 in Jan and was weaker than market expectations for a +0.1 point rise to 50.5., 23914=March E-mini S&Ps (ESH13 -0.50%) this morning are down -5.75 points (-0.38%) on today's sequestration and on generally weak global economic data released today. The S&P 500 index on Thursday traded higher into early afternoon, but erased its advance and tumbled into the close after the Senate rejected a pair of partisan proposals to replace sequestration that begins Friday. Other negative factors included the weaker-than-expected Q4 U.S. GDP (+0.1% versus expectations of +0.6%) and the IMF's statement that it will cut its GDP forecast for the U.S. because of sequestration. Supportive factors included (1) carry-over strength from a rally in European stocks after ECB President Draghi said the ECB is \"far\" from considering a liquidity exit, (2) the larger-than-expected decline in weekly U.S. jobless claims (-22,000 versus expectations of -2,000) and (3) the unexpected increase in the Feb Chicago purchasing managers index to its best level in 11 months (+1.2 to 56.8 versus expectations of -1.6 to 54.0). Closes: S&P 500 -0.09%, Dow Jones -0.15%, Nasdaq -0.10%., 22788=The markets today will be closely watching a meeting at the White House between President Obama and Congressional leaders although no progress is expected to be made to avert the sequester that begins today. Today's Feb ISM manufacturing index is expected to show a decline of -0.6 to 52.5, reversing the +2.9 point increase to 53.1 seen in January. Feb total vehicle sales are expected to dip to 15.10 mln from 15.23 mln in January as consumer spending takes at least a mild hit from the fiscal cliff deal. Today's final-Feb U.S. consumer confidence index from the University of Michigan is expected to be unrevised from the early-Feb report of 76.3. Today's Jan PCE deflator is expected to ease to a 3-1/4 year low of +1.2% y/y from +1.3% y/y in December. Meanwhile, the Jan core PCE deflator, which is the Fed's preferred inflation measure, is expected to ease to +1.3% y/y from the 1-1/2 year low of +1.4% y/y seen in December., 21132=Japan's Feb vehicle sales fell by -12.2% y/y, improving a bit from -12.9% y/y in Jan., 22090=The Eurozone Feb CPI report of +1.8% y/y eased from +2.0% in Jan and was weaker than market expectations of +1.9%., 22221=The Eurozone Jan unemployment rate rose by +0.1 point to 11.9% from a revised 11.8% in Dec (prelim 11.7%) and showed a weaker labor market than market expectations for a report of 11.8%. The Feb unemployment rate of 11.9% was a record high for the series that has a history back to 1995. The number of unemployed persons rose by 201,000 to 18.998 million persons. The Jan youth unemployment rate rose to a record 24.2%, which was bad enough except that Spain's youth unemployment rate rose to an unfathomable 55.5%., 21780=The German final-Feb manufacturing PMI was revised higher by +0.2 points to 50.3 from 50.1 in early-Feb, which was 0.2 points better than market expectations for an unrevised report of 50.1. The Eurozone final-Feb manufacturing PMI was revised +0.1 point higher to 47.9 from 47.8 in early-Feb., 21368=The German Jan retail sales report of +3.1% m/m and +2.4% y/y was substantially better than market expectations of +0.9% m/m and -1.7% y/y. Dec was revised to -2.1% m/m and -3.7% y/y from -1.7% m/m and -4.7% y/y., 29349=April WTI crude oil (CLJ13 -1.30%) this morning is down -0.89 (-0.97%) and April gasoline (RBJ13 -0.91%) is down -0.0354 (-1.14%) on weak global economic data and today's U.S. sequestration. Crude oil and gasoline on Thursday closed mixed. April gasoline posted a 1-month low but rebounded higher after the Phillips 66 Wood River refinery in Roxana, Illinois and the Exxon Mobil Joliet, Illinois, refinery that supply the Midwest with gasoline, reported issues with production units that may limit their gasoline output. Other bullish factors included the bigger-than-expected decline in weekly U.S. jobless claims (-22,000 versus expectations of -2,000) and the Feb Chicago purchasing managers index which unexpectedly expanded to its best level in 11-months (+1.2 to 56.8), and suggests stronger fuel consumption. Bearish factors included (1) the rally in the dollar index to a 6-month high, (2) weaker-than-expected U.S. Q4 GDP (+0.1% q/q annualized versus expectations of +0.6%), and (3) concern that the U.S. economy and energy demand will slow once sequestration begins on Friday. Closes: CLJ3 -0.71 (-0.77%), RBJ3 +0.0054 (+0.17%)., 23736=Three of the S&P 500 companies are scheduled to release earnings today: Pepco Holdings (consensus $0.20), Best Buy (1.55), and Berkshire Hathaway ($1793.24)., 20157=Japan's Jan jobless rate of 4.2% was in line with market expectations and was down from a revised 4.3% in Dec (prelim 4.2%). The Jan job-to-applicant ratio rose to 0.85 from a revised 0.83 in Dec., 20370=Japan's Jan national CPI fell to -0.3% y/y from -0.1% y/y in Dec was showed deeper deflation than market expectations of -0.2% y/y. The Feb Tokyo CPI fell to -0.9% y/y from a revised -0.5% y/y in Jan. The deeper deflation rates will provide a stronger basis for the new BOJ chief Kuroda to pursue the expanded asset purchase program that he is widely expected to adopt., 27842=June 10-year T-notes (ZNM13 +0.21%) this morning are up 8 ticks on increased safe-haven demand with the sell-off in stocks. June 10-year T-note prices on Thursday closed higher after U.S. GDP grew less than expected in Q4 along with increased safe-haven demand for Treasuries on concern the automatic spending cuts that begin Friday from sequestration will slow growth in the U.S. economy. Closes: TYM3 +3.5, FVM3 +2.0., 21597=The UK Feb PMI manufacturing index fell by -2.6 points to 47.9 from a revised 50.5 in Jan and was -3.1 points weaker than market expectations for an increase to 51.0., 34574=U.S. STOCK CALENDAR03/01/2013, 30668=GLOBAL EVENT CALENDAR03/01/2013, 17522=March E-mini S&Ps (ESH13 -0.50%) this morning are down -0.38% on weaker-than-expected Chinese and UK manufacturing PMI reports, the climb in the Eurozone unemployment rate to a new record high of 11.9%, and the U.S. automatic spending cuts that go into effect today. European stocks are down sharply by -1.29%. Asian stocks closed mixed today with Japan up +0.41%, Hong Kong down -0.61%, and China down -0.17%. Commodity prices are showing a fairly sharp loss on average of -0.52%. April crude oil (CLJ13 -1.30%) is down -0.97%, April gasoline (RBJ13 -0.91%) is down -1.14%, April gold (GCJ13 -0.44%) is down -0.70%, May copper (HGK13 -1.78%) is sharply lower by -1.71%, grains and softs are lower, and livestock is higher. The dollar index (DXY00 +0.40%) is up +0.40% on increased safe-haven demand with the sell-off in U.S. and European stocks. EUR/USD (^EURUSD) is down -0.40% and USD/JPY (^USDJPY) is up +0.29%. June 10-year T-notes (ZNM13 +0.21%) are up 8 ticks., 19256=President Obama today will meet at the White House with top Congressional leaders but the $85 billion in sequestration will go into effect today with no serious negotiations for an alternative. The big issue now is the continuing spending resolution that must be passed by March 27 to keep the government operating through the end of the fiscal year., 21234=The UK Feb nationwide house price report of +0.2% m/m and unchanged y/y was roughly in line with market expectations.}",
