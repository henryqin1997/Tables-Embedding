Accordingly, the scope of the invention is intended to be defined by the claims that follow. Referring now to FIG. 8, the tilt tube 84 preferably consists of a hollow cylinder. An opening 110 to the hollow center, directly under the first cable slot 104 in the yoke attachment plate 86, provides a pathway for an alternative communication cable 112 to pass between the cover 24 and base 22. The cable subsequently exits from the hollow end cap 94 and thereafter into the base 22 via an aperture (not shown) in a side wall of the recess 36. As illustrated in FIGS. 7 and 9, a communication cable 108 between the cover 24 and base 22 passes through a first slot 104 in the attachment plate 86, around the tilt tube 84 within the access gap 80 and thereafter enters the base 22 through a second slot 106 formed in the swivel disk 46. Some slack is provided in the cable 108 within the access gap 80 to accommodate relative motion between the rear edge of the cover 24 and base 22. Other tilt ranges of the cover 24 are possible, the embodiment shown only represents one preferred tilt angle range. Additionally, it",
