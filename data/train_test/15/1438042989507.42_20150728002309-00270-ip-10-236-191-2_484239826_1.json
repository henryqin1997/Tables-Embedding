I recommend The Lemon Tree to anyone interested in the personal stories of those affected by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Al-Khairi family was forced to flee their home during the formation of Israel in 1948, and the stone house they had built a decade earlier became home for the Eshkenazis, Holocaust survivors from Bulgaria. Nineteen years later, just days after the end of the Six Day War, Dalia Eshkenazis opens the door to see Bashir Khairi on the steps. He simply wants to see the home he remembers from his childhood, and in particular, the lemon tree his father had planted in the back yard. His request and Dalia's welcoming response is the beginning of a 35-year conversation. Tolan uses each family's story to trace the history of the land and the governments that have ruled it, and in doing so, reveals why the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains unresolved today. I appreciated Tolan's even-tempered, in-depth narration; my only regret is that I didn't read it when it was first published in 2007. ...more",

I finally got around to purchasing Katrina Kenison\u2019s new book \u201cthe gift of an ordinary day\u201d (published in 2009) and can\u2019t get her words out of my mind. I\u2019ve followed her blog for several months and enjoyed her first book (\u201cMitten Strings for God\u201d) so knew I\u2019d love this book too. This \u201cmother\u2019s memoir\u201d is made up of 15 thoughtful essays that speak to transitions involved in moving, changing careers, and in raising teenagers and letting them go. Nestled among the family stories are Kenison\u2019s supporting words, encouraging moms at midlife to reinvent themselves. The timing is perfect for me \u2013 a mom with three teenagers, the oldest who heads to college in late August\u2014but I suggest it for any mom who treasures the ordinary moments of everyday life. Kenison was the series editor of \u201cThe Best American Short Stories\u201d for 16 years, and I truly appreciate her editor\u2019s and writer\u2019s eyes in creating an easy-to-read book that\u2019s both intellectual and meditative. The Reading Group Guide at the end of the book is an added bonus for me -- I journaled about each essay\u2019s question as I read which I\u2019m sure will help me through my own family\u2019s transitions. ...more",

Margaret Regan puts a human face on the information she collected during a decade of reporting for the Tucson Weekly. She introduces readers to Mexicans and Central Americans who were sent back to Mexico after being arrested for entering Arizona illegally and others who have moved to a border city to find work so they can support their families. She hikes with volunteers who leave food and water on desert trails for migrants to find and use GPS to map the trails most frequently travelled. She accompanies Border Patrol on calls to find migrants who have been reported missing and speaks with Arizona residents who live with, and environmentalists who are unhappy about, the 14-foot wall erected on the Arizona-Sonora border. She dedicates a chapter to each pair of border cities that lie within the sector--Douglas, Arizona and Agua Preita, Sonora; Sasabe, Arizona and Sasabe, Sonora; Nogales, Arizona and Nogales, Sonora--and writes candidly about the poverty, greed, and charity she's seen. ...more",

            "review Donald Miller writes with an insightful eye that borders on philosophical. As he searches to live a life with meaning, he encourages readers to conduc Donald Miller writes with an insightful eye that borders on philosophical. As he searches to live a life with meaning, he encourages readers to conduct a similar inventory. It's not entirely clear why Miller is searching\u2014just that he's bored with his current life. The structure of the book, however, is clear. It's based on the guiding principal he learned in a Robert McKee STORY seminar and paraphrased as: a story is a character who wants something and overcomes conflict to get it. Miller breaks this principal down into a series of essays collected in five easy-to-understand chapters that gradually reveal how he\u2014and therefore, his story\u2014develops. His journey begins while he's meeting with two filmmakers who want to make a movie about the memoir he wrote in 2003 (Blue Like Jazz) and in the aftermath of an uncle's death who he believes died before he could finish telling his story. Miller wonders \"if life could be lived more like a good story in the first place\" and \"whether a person could plan a story for his life and live it intentionally.\" So that's what he sets out to do \u2013 and in the process, discovers that \"people love to have lived a great story but few people like the work it takes to make it happen\" but \"once you live a good story, you get a taste for a kind of meaning in life, and you can't go back to being normal.\" Miller's tone and style of writing creates essays that circle, hover, and sometimes seem to stall. These essays require a quiet space, but they also require to be read at the right time. Readers at certain milestones\u2014whether age or stage of life\u2014are sure to identify more closely with A Million Miles than readers who are knee-deep in the chaos of meeting daily needs. I, for example, am currently preparing for an empty nest. When this book was published in 2009, I was in the middle of raising three teenagers; I was thinking about their story, not mine. I think it would have been easy for Miller to end this book with a happily-ever-after conclusion that found his \"something.\" Instead, he takes his message one step when he writes, \"a good storyteller doesn't just tell a good story, though. He invites other people into the story with him, giving them a better story too.\" Miller has me thinking about MY story and what I need to do to make it better. ...more"
