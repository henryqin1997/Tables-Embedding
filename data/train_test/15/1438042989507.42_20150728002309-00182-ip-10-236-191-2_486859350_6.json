With smaller liposomes, resonant frequency ultrasound will generally be higher than for the larger liposomes. Sizing also serves to modulate resultant liposomal biodistribution and clearance. In addition to filtration, the size of the liposomes can be adjusted, if desired, by procedures known to one skilled in the art, such as shaking, microemulsification, vortexing, filtration, repeated freezing and thawing cycles, extrusion, extrusion under pressure through pores of a defined size, sonication, homogenization, the use of a laminar stream of a core of liquid introduced into an immiscible sheath of liquid. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,728,578, 4,728,575, 4,737,323, 4,533,254, 4,162,282, 4,310,505 and 4,921,706; U.K. Patent Application GB 2193095 A; International Applications PCT/US85/01161 and PCT/US89/05040; Mayer et al., Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 858:161-168 (1986); Hope et al., Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 812:55-65 (1985); Mayhew et al., Methods in Enzymology, 149:64-77 (1987); Mayhew et al., Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 755:169-74 (1984); Cheng et al, Investigative Radiology, 22:47-55 (1987); and Liposomes Technology, Gregoriadis, G., ed., Vol. 1, pp. 29-37, 51-67 and 79-108 (CRC Press Inc, Boca Raton, Fla., 1984)., 103102=[0085] In the case of diagnostic applications, such as ultrasound and CT, energy, such as ultrasonic energy, is applied to at least a portion of the patient to image the target tissue. A visible image of an internal region of the patient is then obtained, such that the presence or absence of diseased tissue can be ascertained. With respect to ultrasound, ultrasonic imaging techniques, including second harmonic imaging, and gated imaging, are well known in the art, and are described, for example, in Uhlendorf, IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control, 14(1):70-79 (1994) and Sutherland, et al., Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography, 7(5):441-458 (1994). CT imaging techniques which are employed are conventional and well known to those skilled in the art. See for example, Computed Body Tomography, Lee, Sagel, and Stanley, eds., 1983, Ravens Press, New York, N.Y., 52917=[0004] Although this model functions well in theory, there are practical limitations in real-world systems. In molecules, the atoms are also influenced by their environment and do not oscillate independently. It is known that the actual breaking of bonds happens in a very short time, usually some hundred femtoseconds. Very short time laser pulses have been demonstrated to initiate the breaking process (Assion et al, 1998, Science 282: 919-922).}",
