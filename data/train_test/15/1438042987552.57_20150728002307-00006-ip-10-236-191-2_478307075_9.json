The telepoint concept offers users the possibility of small light-weight battery-powered- portable radio terminals for making calls anywhere via any fixed telepoint radio transceiver. The telepoint radio transceivers may be located at various places such as railway or underground stations, airports, pedestrian areas, squares, in official buildings etc. They are connected by cable to a switched telecommunication network. The telepoint concept requires comparatively little power consumption at the portable radio terminals whereby frequent change of battery is obviated. Information on UK telepoint standard may be found in \"MPT 1375, COMMON AIR INTERFACE SPECIFICATION\", DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY, LONDON 1989.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets The invention is neither restricted to described embodiments of PRT or RBS or TSN or TTR or TTC or XTR or PABX nor to the particular PSTN described but may be implemented in somewhat different ways. A telepoint radio station or a telepoint transceiver controller may also store identity of served portable radio terminals and frequently page assumed served portable radio terminals for checking their presence in a similar way. The telepoint waits for answers to such paging of assumed served portable radio terminals. When not receiving a response to a paging of a portable terminal the telepoint sets up a call for reporting to appropiate location store the identity of the assumed served portable terminal not answering to such paging. The information in the location store may be changed accordingly. Call transfer means in a PSTN may be used simultaneously with or instead of location stores in residential base station or PABX for transferring calls from a subscriber site to a telepoint station or controller. When used instead of such location stores the portable radio station is programmed to call a network number dedicated to the call transfer means instead of its owm network subscriber number for rapporting serving radio transceivers. Neither when the call transfer means of the PSTN is used together with the location store nor when the call transfer means of the PSTN is used instead of the location stores must",
