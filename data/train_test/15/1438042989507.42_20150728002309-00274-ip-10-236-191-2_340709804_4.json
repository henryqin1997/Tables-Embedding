    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{29473=In 1970, along with Don Bustany, a Hollywood movie producer and childhood friend, Kasem came up with the idea of a countdown radio show modeled after\u00a0Your Hit Parade\u00a0and proposed it to the syndication company Watermark Inc, which was later bought by ABC Radio Networks.\u00a0, 42102=Radio legend Casey Kasem with his wife Jean and daughter Liberty, November 26, 2000. Photo: Newsmakers, 25826=\"If I were doing a real rock show,\" he told The New York Times in 1990, \"then it would matter to know how I felt about what I was playing.\" But, he added, \"I'm just counting them down as they appear on the chart, one through 40. What really matters is what I say between the songs.\", 24142=Following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, Kasem, whose parents belonged to the Druze sect in Lebanon, an offshoot of Islam, became a vocal advocate for Middle East peace and Arab-American causes. In later years he was active in promoting Arab-Israeli dialogue, making personal appearances at mosques and synagogues around the country., 23499=In 2007, after he learned he had Lewy body dementia, Casey Kasem gave his three eldest children legal authority to act as his health care proxy at whatever point he became unable to make decisions himself. The agreement stipulated that he did not want to be kept alive with \"any form of life-sustaining procedures, including nutrition and hydration,\" if he lost all cognitive function and was given no hope of recovery. Differences between the three older children and Kasem's wife played out in increasingly bitter courtroom clashes in the final months., 30568=Kemal Amen Kasem was born in Detroit on April 27, 1932. His parents, Amin and Helen Kasem, were Lebanese immigrants who owned a grocery store. After graduating from Wayne State University in Detroit, he worked in local radio, produced broadcasts for the Armed Forces Network during a stint in the Army and landed in Los Angeles, at KRLA, where he developed his trademark of introducing records with historical tidbits about the artists and their songs. For a time he also had local television dance show., 29165=Casey Kasem's American Top 40, which first aired in the summer of 1970, was a weekly four-hour feast of homey sentiment and American optimism that ran headlong into the prevailing spirit of rebellion in the music culture of the day., 28047=Only five radio stations carried the debut of American Top 40\u00a0on July 4, 1970. But within a year more than 100 did, and by the mid-'70s it had reached nearly 1000 outlets \"coast-to-coast,\" as Kasem liked to say, making him one of the best-known DJs in the country., 22618=He would not say I Want Your Sex\u00a0when that was the title of a 1987 hit song, for instance. Instead, Kasem introduced that one as \"George Michael's latest.\", 26666=About 10 years later, after acquiring the rights to the name, he was again hosting a show with the title American Top 40 (and for a time hosted both that and the competing Casey's Top 40.) He ended his three-decade run in 2004, handing the hosting duties to Ryan Seacrest, who continues in that role. Kasem retired in 2009., 41964=In his final months, Kasem, who had lived in Beverly Hills, California, was at the center of a family legal battle over the terms of his death, pitting his wife, actress Jean Kasem, against his three adult children from a previous marriage. Jean Kasem removed her husband from a Santa Monica nursing home on May 7 and took him to stay with friends in Washington state. By court order, he was moved to the hospital on June 1., 27027=Kasem also hosted a syndicated television version of the show in the 1980s. But his relationship with American Top 40 ended in 1988 because of a contract dispute with his syndication company. The next year, he started Casey's Top 40, a competing radio program on another network, bringing most of his old audience there with him.}",
