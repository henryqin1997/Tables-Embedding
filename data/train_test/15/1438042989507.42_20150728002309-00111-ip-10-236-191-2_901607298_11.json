The range from the choice of classes to quality of professors, Mesa has much more to offer than any of the other San Diego District Community Colleges (which include Miramar, Mesa, and City). I would know, I've attended all three. Mesa even supersedes the other districts such as Grossmont and Southwestern. Even through the budget cuts and all the financial decreases in the past year, Mesa seems to be upholding their standards of actually giving a decent education, as best as it gets for community that is., 4974=Its community college, if you do not want to spend the high cost of what a 4 year college and private colleges make you pay stick with a community college. Mesa is a part of the San Diego Community Colleges (City and Miramar are the other two). At the time of this post $26 per credit for local CA residents is a great deal to get your GE done and go for an AA and then transfer to a 4 year.}",

Overall a good foundation for anyone trying to either get on or stay on an educated track. Tips for prospective students Campus can be a bit confusing, but for the most part it's packed tight together once you get familiar with it. Don't risk parking close to the school because you will never get to class on",
