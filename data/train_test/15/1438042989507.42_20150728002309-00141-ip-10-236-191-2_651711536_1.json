The food in the restaurant is average and nothing to raise your glass at. The Pro Shop is the size of an average one car garage and doesnt offer much of a selection. The prices are extremely high on items, especially \"sale\" items. There is almost no left handed items. Prices are what is expected from premier golf courses and I would be happy to pay those prices. However, recently with the course becoming less maintained and the golf carts becoming less able to finish 18 holes on a charge I think the price is a bit high. There are few holes that make you club down off of the tee, but will make you pay if you don't.",
