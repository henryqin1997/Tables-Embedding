Do they exist?'.[6] In the mid-1960s, a group of teachers from the International School of Geneva (Ecolint) created the International Schools Examinations Syndicate (ISES), which would later become the International Baccalaureate (IB).[7] by Peter Nehr, International Baccalaureate Africa, Europe and Middle-East (IBAEM) was established in 1986,[8] and International Baccalaureate Asia Pacific (IBAP) established during the same period.[9], 24225=The IB Diploma Programme was described as \"a rigorous, off-the-shelf curriculum recognized by universities around the world\" when it was featured in the December 18, 2006, edition of Time titled \"How to bring our schools out of the 20th Century\".[36] The IBDP was also featured in the summer 2002 edition of American Educator, where Robert Rothman described it as \"a good example of an effective, instructionally sound, exam-based system.\"[37] In 2006, as part of the American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI),[38] President George W. Bush and Education Secretary Margaret Spellings presented a plan for the expansion of Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate mathematics and science courses, with the goal of increasing the number of AP and IB teachers and the number of students taking AP and IB exams, as well as tripling the number of students passing those exams.[38] Howard Gardner, a professor of educational psychology at Harvard University, said that the IBDP curriculum is \"less parochial than most American efforts\" and helps students \"think critically, synthesize knowledge, reflect on their own thought processes and get their feet wet in interdisciplinary thinking.\"[39], 27508=In the United States the IBDP has been labeled Marxist, foreign, globalist, and anti-American.[according to whom?] These accusations resulted in a 2006 attempt to eliminate it from a public school in Pittsburgh, PA.[42][43] Some schools in the United States have eliminated the IBDP due to budgetary reasons and low student participation.[44][45] In Utah in 2008, funding for the IBDP was reduced from $300,000 to $100,000 after State Senator Margaret Dayton objected to the program, stating, \"First, I have never espoused eliminating IB ...I don't want to create 'world citizens' nearly as much as I want to help cultivate American citizens who function well in the world.\"[46][47] But not everyone agrees and Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago believes IB needs to be an option for students in Chicago Public Schools.[48] Elizabeth Brackett reports on the IB in Chicago.[49] The City of Miami Beach Commission entered into an education compact with Miami-Dade County Public Schools with one of the initiatives of the compact to implement the IB program throughout Miami Beach feeder schools.[50], 3747=The IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) adheres to the study of eight subject areas and was developed and piloted in the mid-1990s. Within five years 51 countries had MYP schools.[10] The IB Primary Years Programme (PYP) was piloted in 1996 in thirty primary schools on different continents, and the first PYP school was authorised in 1997,[11] with as many as 87 authorised schools in 43 countries within five years.[12] The newest offering from the IB, the IB Career-related Programme (formerly IB Career-related Certificate[13]) is designed for students of ages 16 to 19 who want to engage in career-related learning. The IB introduced its newly reviewed MYP for first teaching in September 2014.[14], 29911=In other parts of the world IB programs has been well received. In 2013 The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan and the IB announced a plan that will expand the opportunities for Japanese students to complete the IB curriculum in Japanese.[51] In Malaysia a project has been developed in response to interest expressed by the Malaysia Ministry of Education (MoE) in working with the IB to implement the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) in select secondary state schools.[52] The Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC) signed an agreement with the IB in efforts to widen the options offered for parents and to meet the different needs of students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).[53] In April 2014 The King Faisal Foundation in Saudi Arabia and the IB signed a memorandum of understanding to develop IB programs, including the IBDP, in up to 40 primary and secondary schools, with the goal of developing these schools as centres of excellence as IB World Schools.[54] Internationally the IB continues to be recognised as innovative. In 2014 The World Innovation Summit for Education (WISE) announced the IB Career-related Certificate as a finalist for their annual WISE Awards.[55], 15273=The IB is a not-for-profit educational foundation. The IB maintains its Foundation Office in Geneva, Switzerland. The Assessment Centre is located in Cardiff, Wales and the curriculum centre moved in 2011 to The Hague, Netherlands. Three Global Centres have been opened: Bethesda Maryland, United States, Singapore and The Hague, Netherlands., 32010=After Jeffrey Beard, a past director-general of International Baccalaureate, gave a talk on \"Education for a Better World\" on 5 August 2010 at the Chautauqua Institution in New York State, the institution issued a statement the next day in which it expressed \"genuine disappointment\" with the talk, noting that it \"drew heavily upon and quoted extensively from a speech given earlier in the year by Sir Ken Robinson\", while adding that he \"neglected to cite his source or reveal the quotations for what they were\".[56] Ken Robinson is a renowned British educationist who lives in the United States. Through an IB spokesperson, Beard admitted that \"he could have been more explicit about the sources and authors that inspired him for the content of this speech\".[56] In a letter sent to heads of schools that offer the IB curricula, he described this as an \"unfortunate incident\" due to an \"oversight\".[57], 33606=In an apparently unrelated development, the Times Educational Supplement revealed on 8 October 2010, that significant portions of one of IB's marking guides for the IB Diploma Programme was lifted wholesale from unattributed websites, including Wikipedia.[58] In a letter to schools, IB director-general Beard wrote: \"We have and always will take immediate and appropriate action when we discover any violation of our policies or standards.\" The examiner responsible for the plagiarism resigned from the examination board five weeks after the issue came to light.[59], 1198=The International Baccalaureate (IB), formerly known as The International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO), is an international educational foundation headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland founded in 1968.[1][2] IB offers four educational programmes for children aged 3\u201319.[3] The organization's name and logo were changed in 2007 to reflect a reorganisation. Consequently, \"IB\" can refer to the organisation itself, any of the four programmes, or the diploma or certificates awarded at the end of the programme.[4], 17301=In 2003, the IB established the IB Fund, incorporated in the United States, for the purpose of enhancing fundraising and keeping funds raised separate from operational funds.[27] In 2004, the IB approved a strategic plan to \"ensure that programmes and services are of the highest quality\" and \"to provide access to people who are socio-economically disadvantaged.\"[28] In 2010 the strategic plan was updated after substantial consultation. The vision for the next 5 years was to more consciously establish the IB as a leader in international education and the Board outlined a vision and four strategic goals with key strategic objective.[29]}",

Members are elected by the Board on the recommendation of the governance committee, and from nominations presented from the Heads Council, Regional Councils and the Board. To encourage diversity of gender, culture and geography, there are only three ex officio positions: Director general (non-voting), the chair of the Examining Board and the chair of the Heads Council.[34] The IB governance is composed of an IB Board of Governors and six committees (access and advancement, audit, education, finance, human resources and governance). The Board of Governors appoints the Director general, sets the strategic direction of the organisation, adopts a mission statement, makes policy, oversees the IB's financial management, and ensures autonomy and integrity of the IB Diploma Programme examinations and other student assessment. The structure of its different committees are based on respect, representation and collaboration.[33] Governance[edit] The IB has consultative status as a non-governmental organisation (NGO) at United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and has collaborative relationships with the Council of Europe and the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie (OIF).[32] The United States has the largest number of IB programmes (1,665 out of 4,502) offered in both private and public schools.[31] Access remains",
