During operation of the laser device, the optical detector 410 generates an electrical signal S varying as a function of the received frequency doubled output. The electrical signal S is than passed onto the electronic control device 420, which controls the heating element 400 in such a way to counteract variation of the electrical signal S in time, thereby stabilizing the frequency-double optical output. FIG. 10 With reference to Efficiency of the SHG in the nonlinear element can vary during the lifetime of the laser device due to misalignment of the fundamental wavelength of the laser diode radiation and a spectral band of efficient frequency doubling, which can be caused by changing environmental conditions and aging.
