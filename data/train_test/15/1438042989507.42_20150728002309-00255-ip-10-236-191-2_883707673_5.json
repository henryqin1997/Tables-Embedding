    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{5246=One of the most respected rock groups in history, Steely Dan can always be counted on to weave sophisticated jazz-based compositional techniques into the fabric of their songs and wry, clever humor into their lyrics. The band, which has always consisted of the base of Donald Fagan on keyboards and vocals, and Walter Becker on bass and vocals, has existed more as a studio group throughout its history than as a live performing act, except at select times. Fagan and Becker started Steely Dan while they were students, at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, in the late 1960s. They added guitarists Denny Dias and Jeff 'Skunk Baxter, drummer Jim Hodder and singer David Palmer and chose the name Steely Dan, based on a literary reference from the William S. Burroughs novel The Naked Lunch. After a couple false starts with the band's first singles releases, 'Dallas' and 'Sail the Waterway,' Steely Dan made an immediate impression with their first album Can't Buy a Thrill, in 1972, which featured the hit singles 'Do It Again' and 'Reelin' in the Years.' Those tunes, plus 'Dirty Work,' sung by David Palmer, have endured as signature tunes for the band and continue to receive classic rock radio play. The following year, Steely Dan released Coundown to Ecstasy and again struck well with the hit singles 'Show Biz Kids' and 'My Old School.' In 1974, Pretzel Logic, with 'Rikki Don't Lose That Number,' and Katy Lied in 1975 saw the band becoming significantly more sophisticated in its songwriting. Meanwhile, rifts between Fagan-Becker and the remaining members of the band caused some turnover in personnel, when singer and pianist Michael McDonald joined and they began bringing in a succession of studio musicians for their albums, such as the critically acclaimed Aja , with several jazz musicians and Gaucho in 1978. By then, Steely Dan had ceased touring and only produced music in the studio. A number of hiatuses have followed through the years, but the new millennium has seen a resurgence of activity for Steely Dan, with the 2000 album Two Against Nature , which won a Grammy Award, and Everything Must Go in 2003, as well as several concert tours. **Steely Dan tickets_ are a chance to see one of rock's most respected musical groups., 6905=Looking back, it's hard to believe that Steely Dan was once a studio-based band. Following the release of \"Everything Must Go\" in 2003, the band directed its focus to touring and live performances by 2006. They embarked on the Steelyard \"Sugartooth\" McDan and The Fab-Originees.com Tour, which featured Michael McDonald as part of the encore., 5623=The band celebrated the 40th anniversary of 1972's \"Can't Buy a Thrill\" in 2012, and opened 2013 by giving a masterclass to music students at Sunderland College. And though the band currently has no tour dates scheduled, it's only a matter of time until they're back on the road and rocking again., 2613=Steely Dan has just announced a run of shows at New York City's famed Beacon Theatre. The eight-night residency will take place in mid-October, beginning on the 6th and ending on the 17th. Each show will feature\u00a0the band tackling their classics, with different albums being performed on different nights. Among the hit records will be\u2026, 10430=Steely Dan's Donald Fagen and Walter Becker announced in mid-February that the \"Rockabye Gollie Angel Tour\" will not only run in 2015, it has added several new summer dates that will include special guests Elvis Costello & the Imposters., 10161=Steely Dan had already announced an eight-date April run, which included a stop penciled in at the renowned Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in California. But now comes the news that there will be not one \u2026 not two \u2026but three Rock and Roll Hall of Famers sharing the same bill. To say fans are excited is an understatement!, 6107=Four more years, four more tours marked 2008-2011. It started with the Think Fast Tour. Then came the Left Bank Holiday and Rent Part Tour, in which the band alternated performances at larger venues with multi-night theater shows. The following year, the touring supergroup Dukes of September Rhythm Revue and members of Steely Dan's live band came together on the road, and in 2011 the Shuffle Diplomacy Tour continued to showcase greatest hits and deep cuts alike., 9810=The summer 2015 tour dates with Elvis Costello will kick off at Denver's Red Rocks Amphitheatre on July 6th and hit at least 20 cities before concluding on August 12th in West Palm Beach, Florida., 6525=Certified road warriors at that point, Steely Dan rolled on with The Heavy Rollers Tour in 2007. By the time it closed, the band had played in Australia, Europe, Japan, New Zealand and North America. The tour continually expanded as promoters rushed to add more dates in response to ticket demand. The multiple-night stands in Japan marked their first visit to the \"Land of the Rising Sun.\"}",
