            "Wesleyan has so many opportunities to get involved in new activities. Take risks: try out for a play. Be supportive: watch a community sporting event. Express your self: enroll in an art class. There is so much to do so long as you are proactive during your time here.",
            "Be sure to budget your points and meals in order to avoid a dry spell at the end of the semester when you find yourself starving and empty- handed.",
            "Be flexible with your roommate. Understand each other's expectations before the year starts.",
            "Ask for help, don't be ashamed. Wesleyan's intense academic environment is difficult to navigate if you don't reach out for a helping hand when need be.",
            "Make it a point to befriend athletes and hipsters. Be your own bridge between the sometimes daunting social divide.",
            "Wesleyan is political. Wesleyan is quirky. Wesleyan is a welcoming environment that embraces individuality."

    "textAfterTable": "What to do for fun The university sends out a weekly email detailing all of the on-campus events going on in that particular week. The majority are often sporting events of one form or another, but there are also many productions, open mic nights, and other alternative things to do for fun. On the weekends, of course, there is partying to some extent, but it's in no way forced upon students if they don't wish to participate. Food and Dining The food on campus is good, but it does get rather repetitive. There are two dining halls, both of which accept meal tickets and points. One, Usdan, is buffet style, but often has very similar options from night to night. The other dining hall is Summerfields. It has a set menu, and the food is very good, but again it tends to get old. The other major place to dine is WesWings, the restaurant on campus that only takes points. Its name is a bit deceptive. WesWings does have a variety of wings, but it's also a real restaurant with a spectrum of options. All dining areas on campus offer vegetarian- and vegan-friendly meal options, as well as any other food allergy or preference that students might have. Dorm Life The university tries to be very accommodating",
