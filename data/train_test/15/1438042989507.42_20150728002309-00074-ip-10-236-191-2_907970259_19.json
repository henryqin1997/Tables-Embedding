            "Greenville College is a very safe campus! Campus security can usually be seen around campus and can be easily contacted.",
            "At Greenville College there is no Greek life. There are many other groups and organizations to get involved in but the school does not offer Greek life. However there are different housing opportunities and close knit living situations where one might see it as a Greek life simulated situation.",
            "Athletics are very big at Greenville college. There are a wide variety of collegiate sports and intramural sports to choose from. There are also many random activities open to all students that are held in the upper union, Scott field, the local theater, dorm floors, and areas such as these. There are also many opportunities to get involved in the community and other outreach programs around the world. If you like to help other than Greenville would be a great opportunity to get involved in organizations that focus on reaching the needy.",
            "Greenville college is a great place for students who want to grow in their faith and develop close friendships with others interested in doing the same thing. It is a small school that enables you to get close to many of your fellow students and your teachers.",
            "At Greenville college, the money you pay for your tuition, room, and board is known to be paid for the experience you receive while attending Greenville. This college is unlike anything that you have experienced in your life. It is well worth the money that you pay for attending.",
            "Since the town is rather small, students who attend Greenville create their own fun. This is what allows the students to become so close to one another. There are also other cities such as St. Louis that one can drive to for fun, but there are also many random campus activities to attend for fun.",
            "There are three places on campus to go for food. The dining commons and the union are both available to eat with bucks from the meal plan and they serve a variety of foods. Joe's Java is also a caf\u00c3\u00a9/ hang out place that students go to for coffee and snacks throughout the day.",
            "Unfortunately I do not know much about dorm life because I commute! However, I have many friends who live in the dorms and they love it. You get really close with your floor and get to participate in Bible study and other floor activities.",
            "The classes that Greenville provides are engaging and they implement values into all topics that they teach. Classes challenge students to develop and grow both academically and spiritually. If you attend class at Greenville, then you are sure to thrive in the classes.",
            "One tip that I suggest for students who will be attending Greenville and all other colleges is to attend class! It is almost impossible to pass if you are not going to classes. Another tip I would give is to make friends with your teachers. They are their to help you and they really do care about you at Greenville. The last tip would be to join as many campus activities and groups as you can! College goes fast and you should make the most of it!",
            "Greenville College is a unique school that allows you to build strong relationships and grow in all areas of your life. You are challenged and encouraged at Greenville to grow in not only your academic learning, but your spiritual learning as well. It is a beautiful school that gives you an experience unlike any other."

A cross cultural experience is actually an academic requirement for GC students, and it is highly encouraged that students take a semester to study abroad. If you come to GC, you will work with your adviser in your respective major to plan out your four years, classes you should take, when you should take them, stuff like that (VERY handy!), and they will work with you to include a study abroad semester in your four-year plan. The cool thing is, you can still graduate after four regular years, despite going away from GC for a semester! Also, if you're a music major looking into getting a recording contract, GC has the connects to help you get there. Rod Kim, Class of 2005, just put out his debut album last fall (sold at Best Buy, iTunes, Amazon, etc.) and his song Tomorrow She's Mine is featured on Rock Band 2 (I played it, and it was fantastic :)) and}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here Greenville College in a rural area with cornfields no more than a mile away on either side of it. For a student like me, coming from being in Chicago for high school and then having transferred to Greenville form a larger university in St. Louis, Greenville College feels restrictive. There are all of your basic necessities around you - movie theater, CVS, Dollar General, movie rental places, fast food restaurants, and 24 diners - however, it is the mere size of Greenville that can get to you and feel less than satisfying. So I say for those who are use to the rural setting Greenville College may uphold your expectations. For those coming from a city or a larger university, you may be in shock at first, but I am enjoying myself here anyway, as I am learning to take things at a little bit slower pace. Am learning a lot Greenville College has provided an environment that promotes learning and conversation. The small class sizes have allowed conversations in the classroom to explore depths that would more difficult to reach in a larger setting. I have been able to actually experience my field of study first hand (elementary education), within my first year of attending Greenville College.
