            "Great alert system offered to keep students updated on any criminal events and lots of emergency poles around campus to click if you need help.",
            "Just so many options!",
            "There is a bat house on campus that you can go to just after sundown to watch the bats fly right in front of your eyes.",
            "UF has for a while now been rated among the top for the best education provided for the amount paid. They do an excellent job!",
            "There's Lake Wauberg which is free for students and has canoeing, kayaking, rock climbing etc. There's always art festivals and cultural events going on. There's plenty of bars and clubs within walking distance of the campus and of most off campus housing. There's also so many unique Gainesville-only restaurants to try out (I recommend Satchel's Pizza, it's a Gainesville tradition).",
            "I wish there were more diverse food options in the student union but they are definitely making improvements to the cafeterias.",
            "Not the newest of dorms, although many of them are currently being renovated, but you will meet plenty of fun, new people there!",
            "Definitely not very many easy courses available.",
            "This school is definitely an academic challenge but if you work hard and stay focused you should do fine. Be sure to attend all of your classes as it really does help you do better and many professors reward students for their attendance. Also get involved! There's so many clubs and organizations available on campus for students to get involved and meet new people.",
            "This University is extremely welcoming and feels like a home away from home. UF has strong traditions and a diverse student population that is sure to suit anyone. I loved my time here!"

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{34809=Get everything together early and be as prepared as possible to apply by that November 1 deadline - UF has scrapped Early Decision along with a few ivies in the country., 1094294=Make sure to really work on your application to UF to make sure there are no errors. Aim for an SAT and ACT score within their middle 50% (somewhere between a 1900 and 2100 for the SAT and 27-31 for the ACT) or better, and make sure to take many rigorous classes in high school. Also, show a passion for attending UF in your essays or elsewhere on your application., 582346=i guess we're safe... there's blue emergency lights scattered around the campus, a separate police dept for uf, and scan-card dorms, but rapings and suspects with guns have been reported to the students via email and text just in fall 2011. oh and some shots fired... but i haven't seen anything, which is good. just make smart choices. the person who got raped, got in the car for a ride to campus with an elderly male she didn't know., 613241=there is so much to do at the university of florida! in the reitz union there is a game room with a bowling alley which is always a lot of fun. uf also has gator nights every friday night, where students can go to the reitz union for free and partake in a bunch of activities including midnight breakfast. they also show movies in the reitz union on fridays. there are also about 1000 clubs at uf as well as multiple sororities and fraternities. lastly the gator nation is very big on football. there's nothing like being in the swamp cheering on the gators with your gator family., 911913=There are numerous blue light emergency posts everywhere on campus, and guarantee police assistance within 60 seconds of when the button was pushed. A free snap transportation service is provided, which gives students a ride anywhere on campus after 3:00 AM., 49808=UF is one of the top 50 universities in the US and a great education for a tuition of about $4000 a year and housing is about $2000 for each semester is an amazing deal. If you received Bright Futures you really only have to pay for housing (and of course books and food.) UF also has many research opportunities with top-rated professors available for undergraduates., 48916=Apply as early as possible, way before the November 1st deadline. The earlier you apply, the earlier you can apply for housing (if you are planning on living on campus.) I find that living on campus is really convenient, where you can literally wake up ten minutes before your class and still make it. Off campus has it's perks but it costs about the same as on campus housing and you have to take the bus (which are often times always late.) I suggest living on campus for at least your first year. Also, UF seems to emphasize this quite a lot but GET INVOLVED! Try something new! Get new experiences!, 820345=There are over 1000 student organizations, if we don't have the one you are looking for it is extremely easy to create one yourself., 611633=the university of florida has about 1000 clubs with everything from a quidditch team to clubs for intramural sports., 939581=Dorms are not my thing. I stayed in them and sharing a bathroom with many girls is not what I enjoy. A plus for dorms is that you can meet a lot of people and you are right on campus so classes will be closer, as long as your 7:30 class isn't on the opposite side of campus, you will be able to enjoy every second of sleep., 502966=The campus is gorgeous (besides the weather in August and September, but that's horrible everywhere in Florida)! For being such a large university, it's really easy to get involved in organizations., 322695=The French Fries is a favorite sculpture near the Marston Science Library done by artist John Henry that was placed on campus in February 1989. Though the actual name of the piece is Alachua, named for the county which the city of Gainesville calls home, it still remains a notorious landmark often referred to when giving directions to campus visitors and Freshman. Another popular sculpture around campus, The Potato, is located near Turlington Hall and serves as a popular meeting point. Krishna Lunch, a full vegetarian meal, is served daily in the Plaza of the Americas for dirt cheap, and it is delicious!, 246201=Home to almost 1000 campus organizations, UF offers something for every student that attends. From greek life to skydiving to intramurals, almost anything you can think of will probably exist at the University., 172699=Like I previously mentioned, there are almost 1000 clubs and just about anything you can think of. There are tons of intramural sports and workout facilities all over campus!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck One of the least expensive state schools in Florida and also one of the cheapest housing areas in the state. There is also buses to take you practically anywhere in the area so you don't have to waste your own gas. Am enjoying being here The school spirit is so infectious it's crazy. You will love being around for any sporting event whether its gymnastics or football. There is always something to do whether its tubing at Lake Wauburg, floating down the river at Jennie Springs or partying at Midtown. Am learning a lot Most of the professors are always willing to help out and make you want to learn. There is also TutoringZone for those classes which pose more of a challenge or teaching assistants who sit around and wait for you to ask questions.
