A next important and novel feature of the invention resides in the provision of a battery charger which, upon testing of a battery connected therewith and finding that the battery is rechargeable, functions to calculate the maximum charging current the battery can safety accept; the maximum period of time that charging current must be applied to the battery to effect full recharging thereof; that automatically operates to cause that calculated charging current to be directed to the battery; and, that operates to turn the charger off and to signal the operator that the battery is recharged, or when the set maximum charging period has expired, whichever occurs first. An important and novel aspect and feature of this invention resides in the provision of a battery charger that, upon being connected with a battery and turned on, immediately tests the battery for shorted plates, open wells and other defects that render the battery non-rechargeable and signals the operator of the charger that the battery is non-rechargeable.
