No. 4,669,543 which issued June 2, 1987, there is described a method for consolidating sand using an acid curable resin and utilizing as a catalyst, the reaction product of an acid and an alkyl metal or ammonium molybdate. In that instance, the catalyst is incorporated in an aqueous carrier fluid which comprises the continuous phase of an emulsion in which the polymerizable resin is the dispersed or discontinuous phase. Thus this process requires that the emulsion be resolved or broken after it is located in the portion of the formation where the permeable consolidating mass is desired, which is difficult to achieve to the degree of completion and accuracy of timing necessary to accomplish the desired strong durable consolidating matrix necessary for a long lasting sand consolidation process., 24213=This application is related to Pending Application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes Although our invention has been described in terms of a series of specific preferred embodiments and illustrative examples which applicants believe to include the best mode for applying their invention known to them at the time of this application, it will be recognized to those skilled in the art that various modifications may be made to the composition and methods described herein without departing from the true spirit and scope of our invention which is defined more precisely in the claims appended hereinafter below. In order to accomplish adequate contact of the portion of the unconsolidated sand formation adjacent to the production well, a total of 166 gallons of sand consolidating fluid is required. The required volume of sand consolidation treating fluid is formulated by mixing 45 gallons of furfural alcohol with 119.0 gallons of methanol to which had previously been added 2.0 gallons of sulfuric acid. The sand consolidation fluid is injected into a steam line at the wellhead in a ratio of 90 parts steam to 10 parts sand consolidating fluid. Steam temperature is 300\ufffd F. and the steam quality is 85 percent. This fluid is injected into the formation at a rate of about 1,440 gallons per hour. After all of the treating fluid has been injected into the formation, the well is shut in for 6 hours to ensure complete polymerization. At the conclusion of this shut-in period, the well is",
