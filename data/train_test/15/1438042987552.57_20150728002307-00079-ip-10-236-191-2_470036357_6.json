Accordingly, it is intended that the invention be limited only in terms of the appended claims. As can be seen, the present invention advantageously reminds the vehicle operator that another person is belted within the vehicle. After step 66, an indicator signal generated by the controller is used to generate an indicator or actuate an indicator in step 68. As mentioned above, various combinations of indicators may be used. Various voice.commands provided over the audio system of the vehicle may be generated to remind the vehicle operator that a seat belt is still fastened which indicates a person is still within the vehicle. Likewise, a horn 34 may be activated as well as interior lights 36 or exterior lights 38. Of course, combinations of either may be used. A transmitter 40 may also be actuated to provide a reminder on a device such as a remote keyless entry device provided with a receiver or a cellular phone or paging device. Referring now to FIG. 3, the process begins in step 60. In step 60, controller determines whether the system is enabled. The system may automatically be enabled or may be enabled or disabled by the reminder button 28 described above. If the system is enabled, step 62 is executed. In step 62",
