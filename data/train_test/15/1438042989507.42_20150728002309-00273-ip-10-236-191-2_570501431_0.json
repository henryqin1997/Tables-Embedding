Due to the minimal distortion and barely perceptible field curvature, it can be recommended for highly demanding architecture photography even at the 16 mm setting. The ultra compact shape is achieved by two aspherical elements. A new design of the interior focusing significantly enhances the quality in the close-focus range through an adaption of the floating element principle. Brilliant field depth can therefore be used from a distance of 0.33 m for hyperfocal photography.}",
