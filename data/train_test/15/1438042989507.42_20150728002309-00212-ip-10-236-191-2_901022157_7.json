            "The campus police department is located on campus and is always working very hard to keep students safe. Security escorts to and from parking lots and around campus are available to students, especially after dark. Violence and unfortunate events at UNM are rare and far between.",
            "I personally have no experience of the Greek life at UNM.",
            "There are countless clubs and activities at UNM for almost every interest and hobby. Since the clubs at UNM tend to be very outgoing if you have a hard time finding the right club they just might find you.",
            "There are plenty of ways to make college affordable at UNM especially for New Mexico residents. The tuition costs at UNM are manageable and if the cost is to high there are payment plans available to those who prefer not taking out loans.",
            "There is beautiful duck pond located at the heart of UNM and plenty of grassy areas scattered throughout campus. These open areas are at the disposal of students to lounge, play outdoor games, or study. If the outdoors isn't what you are looking for there is a game room located on the bottom floor of the Student Union Building. The game room contains many pool tables and ping pong tables for students to use throughout the day. If indoor and outdoor activities on campus is just not the way you want to spend your time there is also many restaurants, bars, and other activities located within walking distance from campus.",
            "The food at UNM, at least what I have experienced from the vendors in the Student Union Building, is a very over priced and not the best of food. I have eaten there on occasion because I was in a hurry or I was very hungry but I have always regretted it. As a college student I don't have very much money and I can't afford to spend a whole lot on something like food, especially mediocre food.",
            "I have never personally lived in the dorms but from what little I have experienced being in the dorms with friends or hearing what they have had to say the dorm life is fun and interesting. The dorms at UNM are relatively small but clean.",
            "Most classes are well paced and in depth. Like most other Universities there are a few bad instructors who don't really connect with students and have ineffective teaching strategies but for the most part the instructors at UNM genuinely enjoy what they do and take time to teach students material. I have been fortunate enough to have instructors who are receptive to students and use the classroom as a learning place for both the instructor and the students, always improving on how the material is taught.",
            "Don't have tunnel vision when deciding your future. There are many great opportunities at UNM, take some time to explore all the options in front of you. Get a degree in what you find interesting. The sky is the limit when it comes to education and you decide how far you will take it.",
            "The University of New Mexico is a great place to feel at home when away from home. There are many opportunities to become friends with a wide variety of people, all with great ambition. No matter what your dreams are, UNM gives you the opportunity to explore and achieve those dreams with the help of people who care; faculty and students alike."

As students walk around the campus caroling, luminarias (traditional New Mexican Christmas lights) are lit throughout the entire campus along with decorations. Another tradition we have is the burning of the Aggie; our rival school's (NMSU) mascot. During Red Rally, the students build a giant Aggie and at the end of Red Rally week, we burn the Aggie down!, 363283=Casas del Rio, Redondo, and Hokona Hall, I would say are without a doubt the best dorms on campus. Also, Casas del Rio are new for the fall 2012 semester., 578210=Albuquerque is home, but I've heard if you are from out of state it is hard to adjust. I love it here, and can't wait to graduate in May of next year!, 831214=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 232871=Get good grades. Ask your parents to get their federal taxes done as early after Jan. 1st as possible (if you're a dependent) or get your taxes done asap after Jan. 1st (if you're independent). Complete and submit the FAFSA as soon after Jan. 1st also (definitely before March 1st, which is UNM's priority deadline to be considered for institutional scholarships) and apply to AS MANY scholarships as you can in the first quarter of the year., 88278=Every Fall we have Red Rally, which is the beginning of Homecoming Week. For Red Rally, we burn a giant NM State Aggie (our rival school). On May 4th, we have May the Fourth Be With You, which is big Star Wars festival on campus. We also have several international and culture festivals on campus, which provide great entertainment on your walk between classes.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck UNM has very competitive tuition rates for both in state and out of state students. I am from New Mexico and initially wanted to go out of state. I applied for several schools in Oregon and was accepted to all of them with scholarships. I soon realized that because of New Mexico's lottery scholarship, UNM was by far the best bang for my buck. UNM also led me through the loan application for the small amount that I do need. UNM is not just for in state students though. UNM is very affordable for out of state students. I know many out of state students who chose UNM because it was cheaper than their local universities. UNM offers many scholarships to out of state students including a full ride regents scholarship. Even though UNM is very affordable, it is by no means a second hand school. UNM has top of the line professors and has several nationally ranked degree programs. UNM class rooms sport excellent technology to aid in learning. All classrooms have at least one protector, DVD player, and computer. Computer pods are scattered around campus with excellent processors and 22 monitors. Laptops are available for rent and several of UNM's libraries as well. UNM is very affordable but compromises nowhere. Am enjoying being here As I mentioned the educational",
