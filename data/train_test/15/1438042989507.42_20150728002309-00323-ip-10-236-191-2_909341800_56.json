There is a few different options but when I attended school there 2007-2009 I wasn't impressed with the options. There is also a Subway and Dominos but I personally don't like either.

I guarantee you will find someone just like you. Tips for prospective students SCSU is known for it's partying, and there is a lot of that going on at campus but stay focused and remember that you are in college to get an education for your future. You have the rest of your life to party so don't waste the money on tuition if you're not going to try. Bang for the buck The education is exactly what I would expect for what I pay. The price is very reasonable compared to other campus' around the area. All in all, you get what you work for. So if you want a great education and you work hard for it SCSU will offer it to you. But if you just want to get by and don't really care, that's what you'll get. Am enjoying being here The people on SCSU campus are great! Everybody always has a ton of energy and you can always find something to do. There are a lot of programs and different entertainment things to",
