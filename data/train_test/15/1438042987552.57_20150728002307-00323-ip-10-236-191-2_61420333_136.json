In the letters in this volume, Part I, 1831-8, there are abundant examples of this early build-up of ideas; and in Part II, 1838-60, we get a clear picture in Letters 81, 82, 83 and 86, of how his arguments on the greater, 683665=Darwin, Dr Erasmus (1731-1802), and Wedgwood, 3, 546171=1 From 1860, when the Bulk of work on O, apart from new editions, was off his mind, Darwin threw himself into a series of books on botanical problems, always with an evolutionary background of variation and Natural Selection in view. This is the first mention of his interest in dimorphism\u2014later to include trimorphism also: firstly published in two papers to the Linnean Society on Feb. 20, 1868, under the title:\u2014'On the Character and Hybrid-like Nature of the Offspring from the Illegitimate Unions of Dimorphic and Trimorphic Plants'; and on Mar. 19, 1868, a second paper was read, entitled: 'On the Specific Difference between Primula Veris [etc.], P. Vulgaris [etc], and P. elatior\u2014With Supplementary Remarks on naturally-produced Hybrids in the genus Verbascum'. The completed book, The different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species, was not published until 1877. He had to abandon his first idea that this dimorphism was a step towards a dioecious state., 572947=Cirripedia, fossil; a monograph of the fossil Cirripedia.

This mystical desire to represent the works of creation in diagrammatic form of adjacent circles, soon fell into disrepute; it was from Macleay that Darwin must have derived the word 'inosculating'. Macleay wrote, p. 37: 'These genera I propose to call osculantia, from their occurring as it were at the point where the circles touch one another.' This source of Darwin's use of the word 'inosculating' is of interest in Eiseley's argument on Darwin's lack of acknowledgment of his debt to Edward Blyth. See Loren C. Eiseley, Proc. Am. Phil. Soc., Vol. 103, No. 1, Feb. 1959, pp. 100 and 103, where Eiseley is following the trail of E. Blyth's influence on Darwin. Eiseley writes: 'This trail begins to be discernible in the Darwin Note-book of 1836 with the curious word \"inosculate\". It is a word which has never had a wide circulation, and which is not to be found in Darwin's vocabulary before this time.' Eiseley believed that Darwin followed Blyth in the use of this word. Darwin's use of the word in 1832 in direct conjunction with Macleay's name, refutes this argument. Blyth also had studied Macleay's Quinary System, and also probably derived the word direct from Macleay., 688544=Henfrey, Arthur (1819-59), 186 n.2, 288506=2 Dr Sydney Smith has pointed out to me that at a meeting of the Cambridge Philosophical Society on Dec. 14, 1835, item 6 consisted of: 'communications from C. Darwin Esq., on Viviparous Lizards and on Red Snow', the Rev. Dr Clark in the Chair. The earlier geological extracts from this same letter had been read at a meeting on Nov. 16, and the decision to print the pamphlet mentioned on pp. xi-xii made at a meeting on Nov. 30. This suggests that interest had been aroused on Nov. 16, and that the last pages of the letter already partly communicated were thought worthy of notice one month later., 688054=Gould, John (1804-81), 134 n.2, 201529=1 Four native Fuegians had been brought back from Tierra del Fuego in 1830, from the earlier expedition under Captain King.

Leonard Jenyns, 1800-93, became Vicar of Swaffham Bulbeck, near Cambridge, where Darwin often visited him. Good field naturalist, and author of many works on natural history and papers in scientific journals. He almost accepted the offer of the post on H.M.S. Beagle before it was offered to Darwin. Later he moved to Bath and took the name Blomefield. After Henslow's death in 1861, he wrote Memoir of John Stevens Henslow, published in 1862., 21974=Extracts from some of these letters have been accessible to readers in Life and Letters of Charles Darwin edited by Francis Darwin, whilst further selections were included in More Letters, edited by Francis Darwin and A.

Also The Balanidae (or Sessile Cirripedes) etc. 1854 (Ray Society)., 604500=Darwin's interest in corals during the early part of the voyage was clearly zoological, and it was not until he found impressive evidence of crustal movement in the Andes that he began to form his theory of the development of barrier reefs and atolls by slow subsidence of the reef foundations. This was first mentioned in a field notebook in July 1835, (see Charles Darwin and the Voyage of the Beagle by Nora Barlow, 1945, pp. 243-4) and written out in full as a separate paper in December 1835 ('C. Darwin: Coral Islands', edited by D. R. Stoddart, Atoll Research Bulletin 88, 1962). After the voyage Darwin expanded the theory into a book on The structure and distribution of coral reefs (1842), which is the definitive statement of his theory. Darwin stressed the fact that reef corals can only live in shallow water, and where reefs rise from deep water, they can only be explained by subsidence of the foundations, with the corals keeping pace by upward growth. This implies that thicknesses of reef limestone greatly exceeding the depth at which corals can grow may develop in such places. Deep borings in reefs to test Darwin's theory have shown 1,114 ft of reef limestone at Funafuti, 2,556 ft at Bikini and 4,610 ft at Eniwetok, the latter cores ending in oceanic basalts as Darwin's theory would predict, and the whole column of limestone being formed of shallow-water organisms. These results strikingly confirmed Darwin's views for deep-ocean atolls, and further evidence has come from seismic and gravity studies in the Gilbert, Ellice and Marshall Islands; from the dredging of volcanic rocks from great depths on atoll slopes in the Marshall and Tuamotu Islands; and from the discovery of drowned seamounts in the Pacific, some capped by fossil corals, which presumably subsided too rapidly for the growing corals to keep pace with them. For deep-ocean reefs, Darwin's theory is thus strikingly confirmed. For, 93221=The circumstances are these Captain Fitzroy (a nephew of the Duke of Grafton's) sails at the end of September in a ship to survey in the first instance the S.

He is familiar with William Dawson Turner's handwriting, and told me in addition that Dawson Turner amassed 'all kinds of manuscript collections from members of his family and friends and had them bound. Many of them contained similar notes on their fly-leaves.' These letters from Darwin to Henslow probably became known to Dawson Turner through Henslow's friend William Hooker, long before the closer ties of family and friendship which were to follow; for William Hooker's son Joseph married Henslow's daughter Frances in 1851, and Joseph Hooker became Charles Darwin's closest friend for the last forty years of his life., 409553=2 Geological Observations on South America.

Maypo I examined the Tertiary plains, already partially described by M. Gay.1 The fossil shells appear to me, to be far more different from the recent ones, than in the great Patagonian formation: it will be curious if an Eocene & Meiocene (Recent there is abundance of) could be proved to exist in S. America as well as in Europe.\u2014I have been much interested by finding abundance of recent shells at an elevation of 1300 feet; the country in many places is scattered over with shells, but these are all littoral ones. So that I suppose the 1300 feet elevation must be owing to a succession of small elevations such as in 1822. With these certain proofs of the recent residence of the ocean over all the lower parts of Chili, the outline of every view & the form of each valley possesses a high interest. Has the action of running water or the sea formed this deep ravine? Was a question which often arose in my mind, & generally was answered by finding a bed of recent shells at the bottom.\u2014I have not sufficient arguments, but I do not believe that more than a small fraction of the height of the Andes has been formed within the Tertiary period.\u2014The conclusion of my excursion was very unfortunate, I became unwell & could hardly reach this place, I have been in bed for the last month, but am now rapidly getting well.2 I had hoped, 368329=October 14th 1837, 688104=Gray, George Robert (1808-72), 134 n.2, 77=RECORD: Barlow, Nora ed. 1967. Darwin and Henslow. The growth of an idea. London: Bentham-Moxon Trust, John Murray., 553748=Darwin wrote to Huxley\u00a0(ML, I, p. 103, probably in 1857): 'I am extremely glad you have taken up the Aphis question, but for Heaven's sake, do not come the Mild Hindoo (whatever he may be) over Owen;...I cannot but think that the same power is concerned in producing aphides without fertilisation, and producing, for instance, nails on the amputated stump of a man's fingers, or the new tail of a lizard...I am particularly glad that you are ruminating on the act of fertilisation; it has long seemed to me the most wonderful and curious of problems...Approaching the subject from the side which attracts me most, viz., inheritance, I have lately been inclined to speculate, very crudely and indistinctly, that propagation by true fertilisation will turn out to be a sort of mixture, and not true fusion, of two individuals, as each parent has its parents and ancestors. I can understand on no other view the way in which crossed forms go back to so large an extent to ancestral forms.' Darwin shows in this letter that flash of insight on the integrity of the unit character in inheritance that needed years of work by others to place on a firm basis. Yet in spite of this flash, Darwin's botanical experiments discussed in his letters to Henslow were often based on the belief in the inheritable response to treatment. Mendel in 1857 was already working at Brno on the inheritance of unit characters, though unknown to Darwin; nor was his work fully recognised until after 1900. The conflicting concepts were to remain unresolved in Darwin's mind, and indeed are still a focal point of research., 284154=from the analogy of form & position; they consist of snow white columns, [Like Lots wife added] of coarsely crystall.

A great part of the proof must remain upon my ipse dixit, of a mineralogical resemblance with those beds whose age is known, & the character of which resemblance, is to be subject to infinite variation, passing from one variety to others by a concretionary structure. I hardly expect you to believe me, when it is a consequence of this view that Granite which forms peaks of a height probably of 14000 ft has been fluid in the Tertiary period;\u2014that strata of that period are altered by its heat & are traversed by dykes from the mass: that these Strata have also probably undergone an immense depression, that they are now inclined at high angles & form regular & complicated anticlinal lines.\u2014To complete the climax & seal your disbelief these same sedimentary Strata & Lavas are traversed by very numerous true metallic veins of Iron, Copper, Arsenic, Silver & Gold, & that these can be traced to the underlying Granite.\u2014A Gold mine has been worked close to the clump of silicified trees.\u2014, 84598=Zoology of the 'Beagle', edited by C.

Botany, on the other hand, was in a state of complete stagnation. It had, indeed, been Martyn's enthusiasm sixty-four years earlier that had created the first Botanic Garden at Cambridge, on the five or six acres now occupied by the Cavendish and other laboratories. But during the intervening years, the herbarium collections had begun to moulder away; there had been no botanical lectures for over thirty years and all demand for them had ceased; and the garden itself had become a deserted wilderness. Henslow constantly reported to the authorities on its derelict state, and how it was 'completely unsuited to the demands of modern science'. It was not until 1831 when the opportunity arose to obtain the present site of forty acres on the Trumpington Road, that Henslow was successful in dispelling the prevailing apathy. Thanks to his efforts, the purchase was effected\u2014not without the passage through Parliament of a Bill sanctioning an exchange of lands between the University and Trinity Hall, who were in possession. Henslow had studied the lay-out of botanic gardens, having visited Kew under the r\u00e9gime of Sir William Hooker. Thanks again to Henslow, the gardens were not only ready for the official opening in 1846, but had been planted (according to the present Director, J. S. L. Gilmour) with 'a fine collection of trees, many of which have now reached maturity and form one of the main attractions of the gardens'.1, 420500=I am uncommonly sorry to hear so poor an account of several members of your family; but I do hope that the sea will do all good.

He soon found kindred spirits fired by a similar desire to open the gates of the University to the rising wave of scientific enquiry. Adam Sedgwick, Woodwardian Professor of Geology, and eleven years Henslow's senior, was entirely in favour of reform; and in 1819 the two became the main promoters of the Cambridge Philosophical Society. In the first notice issued, they called upon members of the University who had taken their first degree to attend a meeting 'for the purpose of instituting a Society, as a point of concourse, for scientific communications'. This meeting was held in December 1819; and the fact that Sedgwick was among the originators becomes ironic when we meet him later as one of Darwin's bitterest opponents in 1859., 235253=1 See Ornithological Notes.

By now, Henslow too had moved into the country, having in 1837 been presented by the Crown with the valuable but exacting living of Hitcham in Suffolk. It was a country of small, uneducated farmers who disapproved of modern agricultural methods, if they had even heard of them, and who paid starvation wages. The labourers, wretchedly housed, lived in almost worse conditions than farm animals. There was no big landowner or squire to support the new vicar, no local gentry with whom he could discuss his plans for reform. Yet Henslow went ahead with them bravely.

The volumes on the Geology of the Voyage, his major interest and study during the years of travel, ran currently with the last volume of the Zoology, and came out in 1842, 1844 and 1846. More important as evidence of his maturing evolutionary thought are the two manuscript sketches on evolution of 1842 and 1844, first published in Foundations of the Origin of Species, 1909, edited by Francis Darwin; and in 1959 in Evolution by Natural Selection, edited by Sir Gavin de Beer.

Whewell, 1794-1866, Master of Trinity College, Cambridge from 1841-66, had begun to take an interest in Charles Darwin as an undergraduate. In his Autobiography, p. 66, Charles wrote: 'Dr Whewell was one of the older and distinguished men who sometimes visited Henslow, and on several occasions I walked home with him at night.' Although Charles cannot have read Whewell's History of the Inductive Sciences until after his return from the Beagle voyage (the first edition was published in 1837), he must have heard him discourse in a philosophical vein on science in a manner which may have influenced him profoundly, seeking as he was for an open-minded approach. After his return, Charles praised Whewell's History of the Inductive Sciences to Robert Brown, who was incapable of appreciating him; Darwin could thus measure up their different scientific philosophies. (See Autobiography, p. 104.) Whewell is also mentioned in Letter 47 of May 1837 and in Letter 54, October 1837. In Letter 68, April 1848, Darwin wrote to Henslow from Down, mentioning 'the anecdote about Whewell and the Tides'\u2014possibly referring to Whewell's work on tides, when he arrived at the conclusion, from comparison of the observations made in 1836 in the German Ocean, 'that there must be a point in the German Ocean, about midway between Lowestoft...and the Dutch coast where the tide would vanish: and this was ascertained to be the case by observation...' (See History of the Inductive Sciences, 1837, p. 471.) Darwin had also received Whewell's Presidential Address to the British Association, 1833., 406472=1 J. C.

See also Letter 117, and ML, II, p. 190. In The Athenaeum of November 3, 1860, Henslow wrote of his difficulty in reconciling man-made hatchets found in what had been considered pre-Adamite gravels. 'We have cast off old prejudices erroneously deduced from the letter of the Scriptures, in regard to the age of the earth, but we cannot cast off our received opinions in regard to the time which man has inhabited the earth, without first feeling assured that these hatchet-bearing gravels must be several thousand years older than the Pyramids of Egypt.', 128483=1 Henslow's involvement in Cambridge politics reveals his independent, fearless integrity. It was four years after the writing of this letter, that, during the Borough elections of 1835, his indignation at the underhand methods of the Conservative agents, led him to offer himself as nominal prosecutor against them on the proven charge of bribery. The story is given in L. Jenyns' Memoir of the Rev. John Stevens Henslow, 1862, pp. 60-4, from which I quote. 'Not only was the cry raised of \"Henslow, common informer\", whenever he appeared in the streets, but the same obnoxious words were placarded upon the walls in such large and enduring characters that even to this day (July, 1861) they are still distinctly visible in some places.' Dr Sydney Smith tells me that in the presentation copy of Jenyns' Memoir now in the Balfour Library, Cambridge, there is a note that the inscription on the walls of Corpus Christi was visible in 1881; and Dr S. Smith adds that in certain lights and in certain degrees of dampness it was still visible in 1964., 386194=John Stevens Henslow, F.L.S., by T. H.

Even today, with suburbia drawing nearer and nearer, the house and village still seem remote; but in the middle of the last century the nearest train connection was at Orpington, five miles away. Thus a day in London meant for Darwin, both a train journey and a drive in his carriage along the narrow country roads. Nor were such journeys rare occurrences; for during the first years of Darwin's married life his scientific engagements called him frequently to London. He attended and read papers at meetings of the Royal Zoological and Geological Societies, and had been the latter's Secretary from February 1838 to February 1841 (see Letter 54, p. 138)., 346918=28.

Independent of the pleasure, your account of the arrival of my second cargo & that some of the specimens were interesting, has been, as you may well suppose, most highly satisfactory to me.\u2014I am quite astonished that such miserable fragments of the Megatherium should have been worth all the trouble Mr Clift1 has bestowed on them. I have been alarmed at the expression cleaning all the bones, as I am afraid the [printed added] numbers will be lost: the reason I am so anxious they should not be, is that a part were found in a gravel with recent shells, but others in a very different bed;\u2014how with these latter there were bones of an Agouti, a genus of animals I believe now peculiar to America, & it would be curious to prove some one of the same genus co-existed with the Megatherium; such & many other points entirely depend on the numbers being carefully preserved.\u2014My entire ignorance of comparative Anatomy makes me quite dependent on the numbers: so that you will see my geological notes will be useless without I am certain to what specimens I refer.\u2014Since receiving these specimens you ought to have received two other cargos, shipped from Plata in July & November 1833.\u2014With the latter there was a heavy box of fossil remains, which is now I suppose at Plymouth.

He was constantly absorbed in adding to his ornithological specimens, besides those in other branches of zoology, and in filling notebook after notebook with descriptive notes of the numbered specimens, which take a sense of direction as the years pass. More exciting and suggestive to him than all else, because of his geological theories and growing concentration on species, were the fossilised bones, shells and silicified trees of the mainland, involving a vastly extended time-span., 243063=2 Probably Ranunculus biternatus Sm., which Darwin collected at Tierra del Fuego in 1833 (specimen in the Cambridge University Herbarium).\u2014N.

Wallace's paper, containing an evolutionary explanation of species formation on a natural selection basis, closely resembling Darwin's own evolutionary sketch of 1844.

In the early letters to Henslow, Darwin laid bare the process of his developing thought as the world-panorama began to unfold. His keen eye for detail never obscured his wider vision; each component part was related in his mind to a vast time and space continuum. The idea of change, already paramount in his earliest geological observations, was later to be extended to his biological collections. His eyes were constantly providing the fodder for his theory-making\u2014supplemented by his geological hammer, and the simple microscope installed in his cabin; while each newly-begotten theory demanded fresh facts as tests of reliability. A perfect feed-back system was in operation., 84916=2 Thomas Campbell Eyton, 1809-80, twenty-third heir of the Eytons of Eyton; wrote Rarer Birds of Britain, and Catalogue of British Birds, in 1836 and 1838.

The fungus was not described by Robert Brown, but by the Rev. M. J. Berkeley, Linn. Trans., Vol. XIX, p. 37, and named Cyttaria darwinii. Beautifully preserved specimens still exist in the Botany School, Cambridge (1963). With regard to the silicified wood, Darwin wrote to L. Jenyns on April 10, 1837: 'Tell Henslow, I think my silicified wood has unflinted Mr. Brown's Heart, for he was very gracious to me, and talked about the Galapagos plants; but before he never would say a word.'

Herschel.2\u2014We dined at his house & saw him a few times besides. He was exceedingly goodnatured, but his manners at first appeared to me rather awful. He is living in a very comfortable country house, surrounded by fir & oak trees, which alone, in so open a country, give a most charming air of seclusion & comfort. He appears to find time for everything; he showed us a pretty garden, full of Cape Bulbs of his own collecting; & I afterwards understood, that everything was the work of his own hands.

At first, with his life-long wish to learn from others, he listened to the forum of those scientists whom he most trusted. He wrote his unpublished sketches for the Origin in 1842 and 1844\u2014considerable essays of 47 and 163 pages respectively; but there was no open discussion or sharing of his views at that time. He was dependent on the dictates\u2014and loneliness\u2014of his own scientific judgements, for he had not then become intimate with Hooker or Huxley. Henslow always, and to the end, supported his complete integrity; Darwin on his side shielded Henslow from the more disturbing implications of his theories.

This tour was the prologue to Darwin's geological enthusiasm. Later in life, Sedgwick strongly opposed Darwin's evolutionary views. See his letter to Darwin, Life and Letters of Charles, 345886=1 The botanical collections from the voyage were finally handed over to Henslow's son-in-law, Joseph Hooker.

You will be surprised to hear that we all, children servants and all have been here for nearly two months. All last autumn and winter my health grew worse and worse; incessant sickness, tremulous hands and swimming head; I thought I was going the way of all flesh. Having heard of much success in some cases from the Cold Water Cure, I determined to give up all attempts to do anything and come here and put myself under Dr. Gully. It has answered to a considerable extent: my sickness much checked and considerable strength gained. Dr. G., moreover, (and I hear he rarely speaks confidently) tells me he has little doubt but that he can cure me, in the course of time, time however it will take. I have experienced enough to feel sure that the Cold Water Cure is a great powerful agent and upsetter of all constitutional habits. Talking of habits the cruel wretch has made me leave off snuff\u2014that chief solace of life. We thank you most sincerely for your prompt and early invitation to Hitcham for Brit. Assoc. for 1850: if I am made well and strong, most gladly will I accept it; but as I have been hitherto, a drive every day of half-a-dozen miles would be more than I could stand with attending any of the sections.

At first, Charles and Emma settled in 114 Gower Street,1 where their first child was born; in 1842 they moved to Down House in Kent. Here Darwin lived with his growing family for the rest of his life, contending with increasing bouts of undiagnosed illness. Many suggestions have been made as to the cause of Darwin's ill-health, first mentioned in Letters 52 and 54 in this volume. Dr S. Adler of Jerusalem has suggested that he contracted Chagas disease in South America, an illness prevalent in the Argentine, Chile and parts of Brazil where the 'great Black Bug of the Pampas', mentioned by Darwin in the Voyage of the 'Beagle', is the most important vector of Trypanosoma Cruzi, the causative agent. Any proof of such infection is now well-nigh impossible; but those interested in Darwin's illness should note Letter 54, written when Darwin was in an acute state of anxiety over his load of work. In this, he tells Henslow of his first visit to Dr Clark, and seeks Henslow's advice.

The whole of the coast from Chiloe to S. extreme of the Pen: of Tres Montes is composed of the latter rock; it is traversed by very numerous dykes, the mineralogical nature of which will I suspect turn out very curious. I examined one grand transverse chain of Granite, which has clearly burst up through the overlying Slate. At P. Tres Montes there [is del] has been an old Volcanic focus, which corresponds to another in the North part of Chiloe. I was much pleased at Chiloe by finding a thick bed of [recent added] Oysters shells, etc, capping the Tertiary plain, out of which grew large forest trees.\u2014I can now prove that both sides of the Andes have risen in the recent period, to a considerable height.\u2014Here the shells were 350 ft above the sea.\u2014In Zoology I have done but very little; excepting a large collection of minute Diptera & Hymenoptera from Chiloe.

Luckily, however, some of the collections from different islands had been kept separate, and he had already learnt from local inhabitants that the reptiles originating from the different islands could be distinguished at sight. He saw adaptation everywhere; and in seeing this adaptation as an attribute resulting from a constant potential of variation from within, he reached a hypothetical view of species-formation through geological isolation. The foundations of his life's work were laid in the active work of observing and collecting during the years 1832 to 1835, with the problem of species active in his mind. In the slow sea-passages of the last year, before reaching England in October 1836, the teeming questions on biological change were floating in his mind, as well as the closely related questions of geological sequence. The moulding and cementing idea of Natural Selection which was to follow in 1838, after he had returned to England, changed all preceding evolutionary speculations into a scientific process. The growth of Darwin's ideas under this threefold curriculum can be only partly followed in this correspondence, and it is necessary to go elsewhere for the fuller documentation of his approach to the theory of specific differentiation.1, 359219=1 Henry Colburn, Great Marlborough St., who in 1839 published The Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of His Majesty's Ships Adventure and Beagle between the years 1826 and 1836 etc. Vol. III contains Darwin's account of the second voyage., 571486=BADEN POWELL, The Rev., Essays on the Spirit of the inductive philosophy and the Unity of worlds, the philosophy of Creation, 1855., 121929=3 Possibly Richard Thomas Lowe, naturalist, 1802-74.

The money references suggest that Charles's anxieties of over-spending were unfounded. Though he was obviously a man of few written words, we should not forget that he carried on a daily monologue of talk.

Beagle from 1831 to 1836. That he joined this surveying voyage at all was due to his close friendship with John Stevens Henslow, Professor of Botany at Cambridge, who proposed his name for the post to the Admiralty. During the Beagle's slow and intricate course, due to the needs of the survey, Darwin corresponded frequently with Henslow about the collections, geological, zoological and botanical, which he was sending back to Cambridge. The letters show vividly the impact of these first travels upon his mind and the growth of a dedicated sense of direction. From extreme diffidence, under Henslow's guidance, he soon gained a reliance in his own powers of deductive thought. Later, on his return to England, his ideas outdistanced Henslow's, but their friendship never ceased. The later letters show how\u00a0 much he was limiting his discussion to avoid offence to his old friend. Nevertheless, this collection will establish beyond doubt the importance of Henslow's influence and support in the early years: it was a vital friendship and it laid the foundation upon which all Darwin's subsequent work was to rest., 324776=Cuming collected a few plants in 1829 on the Galapagos Islands.

By 1831 King's College was incorporated, to include in their teaching 'the doctrines and teachings of Christianity'.

Her first interest in her grandfather's MSS was aroused about 1930 by an exact copy of the Diary he kept on board H.M.S. Beagle. She realized then that the immediate impact of any event is never so vividly revealed as in its first recording; and from that moment she devoted herself more and more to Darwin studies., 36777=In all this, it must be remembered that in the 1820s attendance at lectures on the natural sciences was\u2014except sometimes for medical students\u2014entirely a labour of love. Proficiency in botany or mineralogy qualified for no degree or diploma. It was, indeed, largely due to Henslow's own indefatigable efforts over many years that natural science eventually achieved the status of a degree-conferring subject. The Natural Science Tripos was first established in 1851, but only as a supplement to a B.A. in some other subject; and it was not until ten years later that men sitting for this tripos were entitled to a B.A. on the strength of it alone.

From his success as a doctor, and from clever investments, he had built up a small fortune, in addition to which his marriage to Susannah Wedgwood in 1796 brought him a dowry of \u00a325,000. By 1836, when Charles returned to England, Robert was not only financing his own house at Shrewsbury with three unmarried daughters, but was also supporting his two sons.

The subscribers' aim was in line with the current movement for 'giving Instruction to the Working Classes in various branches of Science, and more especially in Natural History'. But Henslow threw his net over a wider audience, and alludes to 'those gross blunders which are so constantly made, even by otherwise well-educated persons, concerning the nature and origin of many of the natural objects with which we are daily familiar'.

He became seriously unwell at this time, and he confides to Henslow his haunting anxiety lest he should be unable to fulfil his exacting programme of work. There were his collections to dispose of\u2014and at first no one seemed to want them, so preoccupied were the men of science with their own affairs. But Charles Lyell was immediately helpful, and Henslow never failed him. It was to Henslow that he poured out his doubts about the acceptance of the Secretaryship of the Geological Society; it was Henslow who helped him to procure the \u00a31,000 grant from the Government for the publication of the five quarto volumes of the Zoology of the 'Beagle'; and it was Henslow who did urgent proof-reading on his behalf for the first edition of his Journal of Researches, which was ready for publication in 1837., 24465=Darwin's spelling has been followed.

He brought this enthusiasm, moreover, into his formal teaching. Rather than make his students memorise facts from the printed or spoken word, he used the living subjects\u2014both in their natural habitat and on the dissecting bench\u2014to demonstrate the lessons to be learned. He was also a proficient draughtsman who could illustrate his points by excellent drawings. It is not surprising, therefore, that he soon had from sixty to eighty active students attending his lectures; and that 'even ladies sometimes petitioned to be admitted or stealthily admitted themselves'.1 Furthermore, his eager participation on field excursions and in informal gatherings in his own home encouraged students to make their own discoveries and draw conclusions from their own observations., 529220=Down.

Darwin soon felt at ease in this congenial atmosphere; and thus a friendship began that led to far more than the offer of the place of naturalist on board H.M.S. Beagle. Between these two men there arose that immeasurable mutual influence that can arise between two unlike but sincere personalities. Darwin\u2014sensitive, inexperienced, anxious\u2014leant heavily on Henslow's wise, perceptive humanity. Henslow, for his part, must have discerned some unusual quality in this fervent young entomologist. He soon helped Darwin, by his talk and shared interests, to attain that faith in his aims and in himself, which his boyhood at Shrewsbury had failed to provide. The discovery of a fellow-enthusiast, in this formal academic atmosphere, brought to Darwin a new sense of purpose in his work., 550971=1 Charles Giles Bridle Daubeny, F.R.S., 1795-1867. Elected firstly Professor of Chemistry at Oxford, 1822; then in 1834 became Professor of Botany, and 1840 Professor of Rural Economy. At the meeting of the British Association in Oxford in June, 1860, Dr Daubeny gave to the Zoological Section an address on 'The Final Causes of the Sexuality in Plants, with Particular Reference to Mr. Darwin's Work on the Origin of Species', to which he mainly gave his support. Owen and Huxley were both present, and Henslow was in the Chair. Antagonisms were revealed, but the famous clash of opinions came two days later, with Henslow again in the Chair, after an American Professor Draper's paper on the 'Intellectual Development of Europe, Considered with Reference to the Views of Mr. Darwin and Others.' A packed assembly came to hear the great men cut each other's throats, and Samuel Wilberforce's superficial ridicule and appeals to prejudice made him an easy prey to Huxley's eloquent and famous reply.

In the upper parts, the Sandstone begins to alternate with Gypsum, till at last we have this substance of a stupendous thickness.

This bird, No. 710 in Darwin's Ornithological Notes of the voyage, marked the turning point in Darwin's work on birds. It was at Monte Video, in the summer of 1832, that he took over the writing of these notes from his amanuensis, and noted of 710: 'In its habits & structure it seems allied to the two Genera Scolopax & Perdrix...from their long scapulars, when on the wing, they fly just like snipes'.

Darwin's volume, The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the action of Worms, with Observations on their Habits, was not published until 1881.

I can only suppose they refer to a few geological details. But I have always written to Henslow in the same careless manner as to you, & to print what has been written without care or accuracy is indeed playing with edged tools.'1, 343763=2 This possibility was not realised. Darwin's Journal of Researches was first published as Vol. III of Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of His Majesty's Ships Adventure and Beagle in 1839, the delay caused by FitzRoy's procrastination. This volume had a separate reprinting under the title Journal of Researches in Geology and Natural History. John Murray's subsequent editions of 1845 and 1860 contained considerable and final alterations. See Bibliography, p. 218., 66902=But while the community of country and\u2014especially\u2014botanical interests connects the letters of this second series, it should be remembered that Darwin had more absorbing questions on which he was working at the time. Those who are interested should refer to Appendix 2, p. 227, where the major works published by Darwin between the years 1838 and 1861 are listed. I think it is important to emphasise the very heavy burden of literary work under which he was labouring during the whole period covered by the second series of letters; for this preoccupation, together with his ill-health, helps to explain why Darwin no longer reveals himself so openly to his ageing master. Some of the letters in Part II are trivial; but I have included the whole of the Cambridge collection as showing the pattern of their communication. Darwin had had no hesitation in discussing his geological conjectures freely with Henslow in Part I of these letters, however much they revolutionised existing beliefs. But Darwin's work on the origin of species now led him to the Descent of Man, and man's creation was a more sacred doctrine to Christian orthodoxy than were the existence of a world deluge, or the ages of continents., 695103=Mendel, Gregor Johann (1822-84), and inheritance of unit characters, 209 n.2, 374621=2 Four months later he accepted the secretaryship. He held the post from Feb. 16, 1838, till Feb. 19, 1841., 25996=His father, hoping that Charles would be a doctor like himself, chose Edinburgh University for his medical training. The elder brother Erasmus had preceded him there; and Charles joined him, dutifully prepared to follow in the family medical tradition. However, his hospital experiences and the medical curriculum soon turned him irrevocably against the doctor's profession; although he none the less made opportunities\u2014as was his way through life\u2014to satisfy his intellectual curiosity and develop his skills. He joined the Plinian Society of Edinburgh, and communicated two small marine discoveries that he had made. But he could not foresee where his passion for natural history would lead him: in the 1830s there were no obvious professional openings for his particular talents. So, with his father's approval, he left Edinburgh and was admitted to Christ's College, Cambridge, on October 15, 1827, with the intention of gaining a degree and ultimately taking Holy Orders., 179601=I shall begin a letter to you lest something or other should persuade me to defer it till it becomes too late for the next packet\u2014Wood & I had intended writing by the Decr. packet, but just as [I] was about to do so your letter arrived stating that a Box was on its road, so I thought I had better delay till I had seen its contents.

He wrote six papers on the subject in the Gardeners' Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette in 1855. See also LL, II, p. 65, wherein a letter to J. D. Hooker, 1855, he wrote of a case told him by a man, which he at first thought splendid, adding: 'and splendid it was, for according to his evidence the seed came up alive out of the lower part of the London Clay!!! I disgusted him by telling him that Palms ought to have come up.', 48567=Darwin's diffidence and a certain mistrust in himself are shown in the early letters of the voyage. In May 1832 he wrote from Rio de Janeiro: 'One great source of perplexity to me is an utter ignorance whether I note the right facts, & whether they are of sufficient importance to interest others'. With his growing purpose and increasing grasp, he soon knew his 'right facts': fact-finding and theory were working in harness. Hypotheses, of which he was never short, led to the search for facts; and fact and emergent theories were under constant re-examination., 306375=1 On the voyage between the writing of this letter in January 1836 and the arrival of H.M.S. Beagle at Cape Town, Darwin and FitzRoy composed a letter, signed by them both, which was published in the South African Christian Recorder in September 1836. It was entitled A letter containing remarks on the Moral State of Tahiti, New Zealand, etc., pp. 221-38., 226990=1 William Clift, 1775-1849, born at Bodmin; went as assistant to John Hunter in London in 1792, becoming Keeper of his Museum before Hunter's death in 1793. He was kept on at a miserable salary for six years, during which time he copied most of Hunter's MSS and cleaned the collection. The original MSS were destroyed by Sir Everard Home, perhaps because he recorded their contents in papers published under his own name. The Royal College of Surgeons was inaugurated when Hunter's Collection was purchased by the Corporation of Surgeons in 1799, Clift remaining as Keeper.

Darwin summed up his own contradictory verdict of the work's value in his Autobiography, p. 118, where, late in life, he says: 'The Cirripedes form a highly varying and difficult group of species to class; and my work was of considerable use to me, when I had to discuss in The Origin of Species the principles of a natural classification. Nevertheless, I doubt whether the work was worth the consumption of so much time.' Let no one agree too readily with this last sentence of Darwin's, which I have here italicised. Perhaps the lapse of nearly thirty years had dimmed the urge that had driven him to the undertaking. Already in 1842 he was well advanced in his evolutionary theory which was to alter all existing beliefs on the species question, without ever having had a detailed drilling in the morphology and physiology of any biological group, so essential to any classificatory system.

One of the bridges from the geological to the zoological occurred when he found the huge plates of fossil armadillos, whilst at the same time he was observing their small living counterparts. This was first in 1832 at Punta Alta in Patagonia, when he commented on the rarity of Megatherium finds in his Diary on October 8: 'This is particularly interesting as the only specimens in Europe are in the King's collection in Madrid, where, for all purposes of science they are nearly as much hidden as if in their primaeval rock'.1 In November 1832 he wrote to Henslow: 'Immediately I saw them [i.e. the plates of the fossil Megatherium] I thought they must belong to an enormous Armadillo, living species of which genus are so abundant here'. [Letter 21, p. 61.] He sent home the great Megatherium head in 1833; thus it must have been as early as the years 1832-3 that the impression quickened, not only of the past geological importance of these specimens, but of their connection with their living counterparts, the small armadillos then roaming the Pampas., 36421=1 J.

Nothing could be more simple, cordial, and unpretending than the encouragement which he afforded to all young naturalists. I soon became intimate with him, for he had a remarkable power of making the young feel completely at ease with him though we were all awe-struck with the amount of his knowledge. Before I saw him, I heard one young man sum up his attainments by simply saying that he knew everything. When I reflect how immediately we felt at perfect ease with a man older and in every way so immensely our superior, I think it was as much owing to the transparent sincerity of his character as to his kindness of heart; and, perhaps, even still more to a highly remarkable absence in him of all self-consciousness. One perceived at once that he never thought of his own varied knowledge or clear intellect, but solely on the subject in hand.

Ayres, that it went to Liverpool by the Brig Basingwaithe\u2014If you have not received it,\u2014it is, I think, worth taking some trouble about. In [September del] October two casks & a jar were sent by H.M.S. Samarang via Portsmouth. I have no doubt you have received them. With this letter I send a good many bird skins; in the same box with them, there is a paper parcel, containing pill-boxes with insects: the other pill-boxes require no particular care: you will see in two of these boxes, some dried Planariae, [terrestrial added] the only method I have found of preserving them (they are exceedingly brittle). By examining the white species I understand some little of the internal structure.\u2014There are two small parcels of seeds.\u2014There are some plants, which I hope may interest you, or at least those from Patagonia, where I collected everyone in flower:\u2014there is a bottle, clumsily, but I think securely corked, containing water and gaz from the hot [Springs del] Baths of Cauquenes, seated at foot of Andes & long celebrated for medicinal properties.\u2014I took pains in filling & securing both water & gaz,\u2014If you can find any one who likes to analyze them; I should think it would be worth the trouble.\u2014I have not time at present to copy my few observations about the locality etc etc of these Springs.\u2014Will you tell me, how the Arachnidae, which I have sent home, for instance those from Rio, appear to be, 697460=Raspe, Rudolf Erich (1737-94), Baron von M\u00fcnchausen, 59 and n., 60609=1 See Darwin Revalued by Sir Arthur Keith.
