            "You are not getting on Spelman's campus without going through IT, for the males. It really does make you feel safe, sometimes you might feel like they take it too far but the campus is completely gated, and our security works really hard.",
            "Very popular. exclusive. over-rated in my perspective.",
            "There are many, many organizations, not only at Spelman but you can join organizations at Morehouse, and Clark Atlanta University too. Club for everything, and if you haven't found one for you (which I highly doubt can happen) then you can register it!",
            "Students who love to socialize! Meet new people, entrepreneurs, people who are open to new people/things. People who can balance well, its not all about grades, but becoming a well-rounded person.",
            "We have songs we sing for fun, especially during New Student Orientation. Everyone learns the Spelman Hymn, we sing it at some convocations. Every Spelmanite has a pure (not cream, or ivory) white dress, or skirt suit, for the white dress ceremony, when you receive your official Morehouse brother, and get inducted officially the Sunday after NSO.",
            "Although it is costly, (in my opinion) the Lord has helped me with finances, through federal aid, scholarships, etc. Don't allow the price tag to stop you, if you really want to come here, and leave with little to no debt, it is very much possible, it is all dependent on YOU. Financial Aid can help, but Spelman is limited on the resources they give out because they are a private institution. Overall, you do get what you pay for, rigorous, challenging and stimulating classes, great network, great resources. It is much cheaper if you are able to live off campus though. Living on campus is a must for at least first year though.",
            "There is ALWAYS something to do on campus, for discussion panels, to social events, fashion shows, gatherings to just hanging out in front of Jazzman's or on the strip/promenade. You cannot get bored on this campus, whether you like to party or parting isn't your scene (it wasn't for me) as long as your willing to step out, you can always find a good time, and fun people. Not to mention we are in the city of Atlanta, which you can always explore, Five points, little five points, variety of malls, parks, stone mountain. The list goes on!",
            "Spelman Caf is getting an upgrade this summer, but as for previously the food gets redundant, after the first week, and the variety of options dwindles over time. You will want to eat out, or not eat often, because the caf is not always filling, or appetizing.",
            "Freshman year, dorm life is the best, I would even say nationally, just because of the tradition of freshman dorm rivalries, makes freshman year that much more fun! As for the no A/C in the freshman dorms, it's just one of those things many have to go through, but it brings you closer to your Spelman sisters!",
            "Definitely a challenging course load, not overwhelming but enough to give you critical thinking skills, and mature your mind",
            "Come ready to network, and excel in classes. Spelman is a part of the Atlanta University and a great place to mature. Your reputation will stay with you, it is a small school. Plan accordingly, and wisely, time management is KEY, I recommend making a schedule. You can have fun and do well. Don't think there will be more drama, or less fun because it is all girls, in my perspective, I think it's the opposite, but it comes down to who YOU are. respect and look out for your sister.",
            "The illustrious Spelman College is a dynamic, diverse, and authentic institution. A traditional, and prestigious school that started in 1881, Spelman provides the foundation needed to be successful at any time place or situation. Focused on developing the global woman from adolescence into womanhood, Spelman is a stepping stone, and a much needed environment for the next generation."

Also, after April scholarships here are nearly impossible to acquire., 256617=Spelman College's motto should be we stand for exclusive Traditions. In fact one of the most prompt traditions to conquer, the Spelman Hymn, defines tradition in its lyrics. Honestly you should learn it now if you plan on joining this institution. The Spelman Hymn (Words and music by Mrs. Eddye Money Shivery, C'34) Spelman, thy name we praise Standards and honor raise, we'll ever faithful be Throughout eternity. May peace with thee abide And God forever guide Thy heights supreme and true. Blessings to you. Through years of toil and pain May thy dear walls remain Beacons of heavenly light, Undaunted by the fight; And when life's race is won, Thy noble work is done, Oh God, forever bind Our hearts to thine. Spelman has so many unusual traditions that I have become immune to them. But do not worry all of them are worthy of consideration and most are optional., 539213=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 150878=Since I've came to visit in April of 2010, I have fallen in love with Spelman. The experiences I receive here I will not receive anywhere else. I am proud to say I am a Spelmanite. The young ladies I met in my dorm will be my life-long friends as I grow. Spelman is right for me. During NSO, you receive a Morehouse Brother and they are suppose to be there for you as a male role in your life while your here. I love mine too death. They are there for me all the time. We spend time together having fun. There is always something to do off or on campus., 259508=There is one cafeteria for underclassmen; Albert E. Manley College Center houses the Alma Upshaw Dining Room. In the lower level of Albert E. Manley College Center there are other options at The Grill. They both have substantial edible food. Spelman College is currently going to renovate the cafeteria and the grill for spring 2013. I am excited to see the changes. I am sure the four stars I gave food and dining it will become five. Right outside of the gates, where Spelman College and Morehouse College meet, there are dining options you yourself can pay for. Jazzman's Cafe is great for coffee, a nice meeting or much needed socialization., 456842=One of my family friends visited my dorm and mentioned that it looked like a summer camp. My dorm did not have air conditioning or Wi-fi. It was 2012-2013., 189590=The illustrious Spelman College is a dynamic, diverse, and authentic institution. A traditional, and prestigious school that started in 1881, Spelman provides the foundation needed to be successful at any time place or situation. Focused on developing the global woman from adolescence into womanhood, Spelman is a stepping stone, and a much needed environment for the next generation., 436483=usually,during the first week of freshman orientation,in the middle of the morning,students will awake to the sounds of yelling ra's (resident assistants)asking them to wake up,and come to sister's chapel (campus church)to sing the spelman sisterhood song while holding hands in candlelight.spelman also celebrates founders day in april,where the graduating seniors are allowed to wear their caps and gowns for the first time,and the freshman must wear all white., 211875=I received a 1160 on my SAT (CR+M), acquired a 4.1 G.P.A, and was accepted. I later received a 1320 on my SAT however scholarships were all gone and most required SAT scores of 1200 or higher. Therefore the school is quite academically competitive., 5095=I work for the work study, the job I did I did not the time schedule. I was given Friday, Saturday and Sunday from 9:00 pm to 11:00 pm 4 day a week. That gave me no time for myself or to go out if I want to go some where. I do not stay out late at night., 131315=The week long new student orientation program where you learn all of the Spelman traditions and are inducted in the sisterhood. Founder's Day in April where we celebrate the college. Just remember to invest in a nice white dress, black shoes, and nude stockings for both events!! That is your official uniform.}",

While in a wonderful atmosphere with fascinating student organizations and wonderful opportunities. I highly recommend attending Spelman College. Tips for prospective students Spelman is an illustrious world renowned institution know for producing women who change the world. This is an excellent liberal arts school. It is located in the heart of Atlanta surrounded by Morehouse College, and Clark Atlanta University. Spelman is a part of the Atlanta University Center. As a part of the AUC you can enroll in classes at all three institutions. Bang for the buck Spelman College is an expensive school. I believe it is worth every dollar. I am attending Spelman on financial aid, grants, and scholarships. Make sure that you apply for every single scholarship and grant that",
