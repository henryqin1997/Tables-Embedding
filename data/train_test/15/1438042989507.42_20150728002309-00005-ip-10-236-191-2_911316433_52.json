            "Creighton is close to downtown, Midtown Crossing, and Dundee, and there are lots of things to do in all of those neighbourhoods.",
            "Lots of great options.",

Soccer is huge here., 5464=If you are looking for a great-quality school in a homely city, then consider applying at Creighton University. Established as a Jesuit center of learning in 1878 in Omaha, Nebraska, the institution has done so much for its students. Not only does Creighton offer a great variety of liberal arts as well as pre-professional and professional classes, which are taught by the professors and not the teaching assistants, but it works very hard to provide an education that is as affordable as is possible. For example, because of this year's recession, the tuition is increasing by the smallest factor ever (almost all colleges raise the tuition yearly), and this fall has enrolled the most freshman that has ever been there. So, for those of you who find Creighton University appealing, get all the information you can about the school. Then, come visit the campus to step into the shoes of its students as they enjoy their college life mentally, physically, and spiritually., 206444=I have never felt unsafe on campus. I don't even feel uncomfortable crossing campus at 12:30 in the morning., 177244=W.A.C.: Wednesday After Class! Every wednesday from about 12-2:30 they have music playing and generally food or some fun craft on the mall! It definitely helps get through wednesdays!, 62912=Take the ACT test towards the end of your Junior Year. Also make sure you study for it. Apply earlier than December to reduce the stress of getting things in before the deadlines. Go to CU Sundays, and also make a personal college visit so that you can get all of your questions answered by the professors in the field of study you want to go into., 290951=When I enrolled at Creighton as a freshman in 2011, it was everything I had ever wanted. Its Jesuit values, academics, and extracurriculars are impressive, to say the least. Nowadays, I see it somewhat less rose-colored, but I in no way regret coming here or the four years past., 293539=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
