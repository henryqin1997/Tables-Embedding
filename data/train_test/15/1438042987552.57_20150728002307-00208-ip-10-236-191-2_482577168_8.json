Furthermore, it is to be understood that although the present invention has been described with reference to a preferred embodiment, various modifications, known to those skilled in the art, may be made to the structures and process steps presented herein without departing from the invention as recited in the several claims appended hereto. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the systems shown in FIGS. 1-6 are used to pump blood which is being either infused into or extracted from a patient. When the present invention is used for pumping blood, monolithic block 110 is made of a disposable material and is detachably secured to the remaining components of the blood pumping system. In this embodiment, a fresh sterile monolithic block 110 is attached to the remaining components of the blood pumping system at the beginning of a treatment session prior to pumping a patient's blood and, after the end of the treatment session, the used block 110 is detached from the remaining components of the blood pump and discarded. Referring now to FIG. 6, there is shown a cross-sectional diagram of a system 400 for pumping fluid at a",
