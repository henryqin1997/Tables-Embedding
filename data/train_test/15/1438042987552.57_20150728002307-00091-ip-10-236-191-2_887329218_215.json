            "There are many football game traditions that you will learn at orientation and at the games, I think they are a surprise so I cannot share here. There is an amazing holiday tradition, though, that goes back 55 years called the Carol of Lights, where the whole city basically shows up to campus to listen to music and watch a parade before they turn on all the lights. It is beautiful.",
            "The education here is outstanding and so many of the professors are impressive with what they know about their subjects of expertise and how they choose to teach it. You definitely learn more than you expect your freshman year.",
            "This is an overwhelming topic. The recreation center at Tech is free for all students and staff, and there is a complete gym, a leisure pool, an olympic sized pool, an outdoor and indoor track, a rock wall, and so many other things (check out the website!). All the football games are also free for students so you know what to do on Saturday nights. There are also many organizations throughout campus and the different areas of study to engage in! There is a strip of fun clubs a few blocks away from campus, and a lot of good restaurants are just a block away, and there are discounts for students at the movie theater.",
            "The options for food here are amazing!! And since living in the dorms your freshman year is mandatory (unless you live in Lubbock), then you also receive a dining plan with Raider Bucks on your ID card. When this card is used to buy food, there are incredible discounts all over campus, and it's absolutely amazing.",
            "The dorms are a little expensive, but are usually clean. Depending on your CA, the hallway has the possibilty of becoming like a family. This is true everywhere but I'll say it anyway: choose your roommate carefully. There are hardly and problems in my complex, but I have heard a few stories.",
            "Depending on your major, academic rigor can go anywhere from no sleep at all to a perfect sleeping cycle. This also depends on the kind of social life you would like to lead, so the more time you spend with other people, the more time you will spend at night doing homework. Some of the most difficult majors here are Architecture (as well as Interior Design), and of course any medical or engineering major offered.",
            "If you are a prospective student, I would highly encourage Texas Tech University as a consideration at least. It is so easy to envision a future here in whichever career you plan on pursuing, Professors acknowledge the importance of educating students in order for them to lead a life that will ultimately help other people with whatever they contact you for.",
            "I have absolutely loved my classes here! The professors are understanding and compassionate, and so are the people I am around. I am never bored and campus life is so enjoyable that it is impossible not to find something you love to do here."

Usually around December and November. Don't think you don't stand a chance of getting in. Once admitted, check up on your ERaider and Admitted Student Dashboard for all info for orientation, housing, required tests and documents, and just about everything else!, 87017=Hi. Can someone please tell me what my chances are of being accepted to TTU? I have a 3.3 GPA (about an 88), but am barely in the bottom half of my class (top 51%). I live in the San Antonio area and attend Alamo Heights High School. In case none of you know, it's ridiculously competitive here and a good majority of the kids are in AP, which gets them more points right away. I'm not one of those kids. Plus my class is very small (only 374 people). At a normal school, a 3.3 GPA would put me well in the top half or maybe even top 25% of my class. Really, a 3.3 is not bad at all. So will Texas Tech take look at the kind of school I go to when they consider me, or will they look solely at my class ranking no matter what? Alamo Heights is among the best and most competitive schools in Texas so that immediately puts me at a disadvantage. I haven't taken the SAT, but I got a 1480 on the practice one I recently took. Let's just assume that's the score I send to TTU. Would that be good enough? Please tell me about my chances. I would greatly appreciate it!, 641541=The Carol of Lights in December is just breathtaking. The entire campus is lit up for the holidays. The architecture at Texas Tech is beautiful. Spanish influenced beautifully designed buildings and they just take your breath away during the holidays. And nothing beats the spirit that you'll feel when tailgating and walking into the Jones for home games! LOVE IT!, 566894=Texas Tech may be a fantastic university, but it is pretty expensive. The tuition for the 2012 academic school year is around $20,000., 705646=One of my favorite traditions on campus is Carol of the Lights in December, which is Memorial Circle and all of the buildings surrounding it are covered in Christmas lights and turned on at the same time. There is a choir and parade, and the entire event is one that students look forward to every year. I don't know any other school that has that tradition, and it's something that I love the most about Texas Tech., 1092619=Campus traditions are a source of pride for Texas Tech students. School spirit runs high and the student section is consistently loud and enthusiastic at sporting events. Every football game is a major campus event. The night before a home game, the Saddle Tramps, a school spirit franternity decorate the entire campus in streamers. On game day, Students and fans come out in large numbers to tailgate on campus, hear the famous Goin' Band from Raiderland, watch excitedly as the Masked Rider flies across the field on a black horse, and cheer wildly as the Red Raiders compete. Texas Tech also has several traditions that do not focus on athletics, the most notable being the Carol of Lights. Every December students, alumni, and locals gather in the center of the campus to sing carols together. The event culminates with a member of the vocal faculty singing O Holy Night as every building on campus is simultaneously lit with thousands of lights., 576770=The biggest tradition is Carol of Lights in December when all the science buildings are lit up and carols are sung. Another tradition is wrapping the Will Rogers statue before game day. Oh, and make sure not to step on the grass in memorial circle, it's a really big deal, and everyone will look at you if you do. Thankfully I learned that before coming here.., 961623=1. Lubbock has some crazy weather so plan on 95 degrees in August and -5 in January. 2. GET INVOLVED IN EVERYTHING! Lubbock can feel very isolated very quickly if you don't. 3. Definitely enjoy the Rec Center - the food here can be good but that Freshman 15 WILL get you., 415507=I have yet to attend a class at TTU. My first semester will be Fall 2012. However, I have talked to many current students and they have all referred to the classes here as challenging, but very worthwhile. Everyone has given positive feedback on the many professors and classwork., 193510=texas tech costs about the same as every texas public university. however, there are so many scholarships available to those willing to apply and plenty of financial aid is given every year. also, if you're a non-texas resident like me and are able to recieve a minimum of $1000 in scholarship money from tech out of state tuition will be waved and you can save even more. texas tech is definitely worth the money., 828539=Before every football game the Raider statue is wrapped in red paper streamers. It is a simple tradition, but after seeing it a few times it will bring pride into new Tech students' hearts. Also, the Carol of Lights is something beautiful that Tech campus does every December. They decorate the buildings on campus with Christmas lights and put up an enormous tree and wreath. Then they sing carols for a while before turning all the lights on. That tradition is one of the most beautiful sights to be seen by new Tech students., 1128682=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 1022516=Point your 'guns' up around town. Boots and hats are almost mandatory. Learn all the football songs and get ready for football season. Come in November to watch the Carol of Lights., 765290=Texas Tech dresses up the school each football game day! The Saddle Tramps (a sort of mens pep group) wrap the main statue of our campus with black and white streamers before all football games. Texas Tech also has the Carol of Lights in December every year. This tradition is when the students gather to watch Tech turn on their extensive Christmas lights for the first time. There is also a concert and lots of hot chocolate and fun., 796846=I would suggest high test scores if your class rank is lacking. I would suggest a Critical reading and Math score of 1100 combined. I never took the ACT so can't speak on it., 169104=steps: 1) start taking the sat and act early your junior year 2) visit the campus during your junior year 3) apply early your senior year 4) get accepted and visit the campus again your senior year 5) attend red raider orientation 6) move-in to your dorm in august and have a great year!!, 355183=Go see your advisor and listen to them. but don't always take there word for it. they said it was impossible for me to graduate in december. but i took it upon my self to talk to the Dean and overload for summer classes and fall and now i will be graduating this december, 163528=texas tech actually throws tortillas at football games. actually it was banned and can result in a 15 yard penalty against tech. but at the texas vs. a&m game in 1992, espn commentators said lubbock only has tech football and a tortilla factory. this didn't settle well with the student body. so when tech played a&m they protested by flinging tortillas into the air and onto the field., 918620=Very rural, much school spirit. Secluded by which I mean it's in the middle of East Texas. Many groups or sororities or fraternities to join. I feel very much like a Red Raider. Study hard and work hard. Ask lots of questions. I attended here Spring of 2013 and will be returning for Fall of 2013., 596839=Will an 1100 in Critical Reading and Math tech shouldnt be to hard to get into.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students 1. GET INVOLVED! There is no better way to meet new people than to join organizations and make friends with those who have similar interests as you. Doing things together brings you together as a family and students do everything together, from taking the same classes and studying together to attending football games and rushing the field. 2. Go to class. Most professors highlight key concepts that will be a continual theme or will be on the exams. But you won't know if you don't go. Taking notes from your friends or other students may be problematic because everyone takes notes differently and your friend or fellow student might not take the same concept out of the lecture as you. Everyone also learns differently but no matter if you read the assigned readings and online PowerPoint's, going to class will drill into you what you are expected to know. 3. Have fun. College is a good experience and there are many opportunities to take advantage of. However, be smart, put your education first, and be safe about how you divert yourself. Bang for the buck Yes. Texas Tech has been most helpful in providing financial aid and scholarships. A little effort is required on the part of the student but it is worth it in the end. If you are having issues with obtaining financial aid,",
