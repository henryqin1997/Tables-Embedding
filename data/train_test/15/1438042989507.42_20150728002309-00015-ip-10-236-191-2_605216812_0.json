His farm was successful throughout the century, and was even said to have saved a large number of American troops when Mrs. Murray entertained British generals with cake and wine, delaying their haste in pursuing American General Putnam's march. By the mid-19th century, upper and upper-middle class were the primary demographics in Murray Hill (J.P. Morgan built a mansion there in 1882). The 20th century saw a similarly upper class population, and today Murray Hill houses many upper class young professionals that take advantage of its location and lively restaurant-and-bar scene.}",
