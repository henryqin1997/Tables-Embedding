Pernick, K. Leib, American Journal of Physics, Vol. 46, pp. 90-93, January 1978., 47037=Of special interest herein are holographic optical elements that form converging spherical waves, i.e., holographic lenses and multiple holographic lens arrays. To fabricate a holographic lens, one records the interference fringe pattern formed by combinations of plane waves and/or spherical waves from a point source, as described in \"Formation and Optimization of Interference Fringes,\" B. Pernick, K. Leib, American Journal of Physics, Vol. 46, pp. 90-93, January 1978. A multiple holographic lens is made in a similar manner, but with repeated exposures of the photographic plate to achieve a spatial offset of the interference fringe patterns associated with each individual exposure. In one mode, the plate is translated or rotated, or some combination thereof, a predetermined amount between exposures to form any suitable pattern. That is, in effect, a step-and-repeat procedure. More efficient multiple holographic lenses are made by using a master multiple holographic lens plate to form the object beam. The waves from each lenslike element in the multiple holographic lens array combine and form complicated interference fringe patterns. A single exposure holographic recording is then made of this pattern, resulting in a copy of the lens array contained in the master multiple holographic lens plate, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/253,733, filed Oct. 5, 1988., 76763=The focal length of the holographic optical element used in the present invention is not believed to be critical for proper operation provided it is typically very much greater than the CCD camera lens focal length. Consider a typical video camera lens such as a Comiscar 1:1.6, 16 mm two element lens which is representative of such lenses and not otherwise unique. It is assumed that the principal plane is in the center plane, a distance e from the holographic optical element. The lens formula for two lenses (the holographic optical element and the Comiscar) is given by:, 59933=The camera 13 might be a standard vidicon type such as an RCA 2000, or a CCD type like the Sony XC-37 miniature camera. The former is preferred if size is not a restriction because the two have comparable sensitivity and resolution, but the former is not subject to vertical pixel saturation which causes vertical lines to form under intense incident radiation, as in CCD types of cameras. One function of the beam attenuator 15 is to limit the beam intensity such that vertical pixel saturation does not occur when CCD cameras are used as the detector., 60506=Recently a new CCD camera has become commercially available, the VIDEK an Eastman-Kodak Company) \"Megaplus\" camera which is especially useful for high resolution applications. The detector has a 1320 pixel by 1035 pixel format. Consequently, its 8.98 mm by 7.04 mm active area size gives it a resolution of 73.5 cycles per mm by 7.35 cycles per mm significantly exceeding other detectors. This resolution provides the present invention with:}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes While several embodiments and variations of the present invention for a passive coherent radiation detection system are described in detail herein, it should be apparent that the disclosure and teachings of the present invention will suggest many alternative designs to those skilled in the art. In FIG. 18, a laser beam 500 is incident upon a body of water 502 containing a scattering medium such as a very high concentration of magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide particles in suspension 504. The beam is scattered on passage through the volume of suspended material. A single holographic lens 506 with no other optical components is then used to focus some of the scattered light off to one side 508 of the original direction of the incident beam. In doing so, the focused beam 508 is well separated from the intense forward directed and small angle scattered light 510. Thus the focused spot could be easily detected without competition from the intense forward directed and small angle scattered light 510. A series of tests have been carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of a holographic optical element even when the laser illumination is scattered by a particle suspension that distorts the directed beam distribution prior to illumination of the holographic optical element, and indicated very positive test results. The optical device 154 of FIGS. 16 and 17 enables the input angles of incoming radiation to be narrowed to",
