Likewise, each weight range may not be available in all colors. Therefore we ask you to list and prioritize your color preferences and to give us guidance if the color or weight range you want happens to not be available. Feel free to contact us if you need more specific info. DX discs are affordably priced and provide an excellent grip in all types of weather conditions. Over time, DX discs will take on new and varied flight characteristics that stem from their use. They start out more overstable, but with use will match the flight ratings. With continued use, they'll eventually become more understable than the ratings. The Valkyrie is a World Record holder.

    "textAfterTable": "\"This is my favorite driver. It is an incredibly versatile disc for me. It works very well with my throwing style. I tend to throw low and the Valkyrie gets great distance with low thrown shots. I typically carry three Valkyries with me during a round. One is beat and used for long turnover shots. The others can be used for hyzers and subtle helix shots.\" - Juliana Korver If you are looking for a disc with more Fade, try the Firebird more Turn, try the Sidewinder more Glide, try the Thunderbird Other Speed 9 discs include the Firebird, FL, Roadrunner, Sidewinder, Thunderbird and Viking.
