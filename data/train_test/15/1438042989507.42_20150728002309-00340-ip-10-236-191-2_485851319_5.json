Such protection mechanisms have not allowed unique, positive identification of users requesting access to information, or of information, nor have such mechanisms been sufficiently flexible in operation. In addition, access rights have pertained to the users rather than to the information, so that control of access rights has been difficult. Finally, prior art protection mechanisms have allowed the use of \"Trojan Horse arguments\". That is, users not having access rights to certain information have been able to gain access to that information through another user or procedure having such access rights., 41494=This application incorporates by reference the entire application, Ser.
