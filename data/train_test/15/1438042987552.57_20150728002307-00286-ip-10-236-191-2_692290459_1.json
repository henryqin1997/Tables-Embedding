The Scottish striker has struggled to make an impact at S6 after Paul Sturrock brought him to the club from Wigan at the start of the 2005 campaign. He was sent out for a successful loan spell at Huddersfield Town before making a similar move to League One with Bradford City where his stint at Valley Parade was less successful. But the hitman looked to be getting a new chance after the arrival of Brian Laws, until problems within the camp saw him shipped out on loan to former club Torquay United at the end of last season. And Graham has since been undergoing a trial spell at League One club Gillingham since being told he can leave the Owls by Laws, and with his contract now terminated he could get the nod to join the Gills in the coming days. The Edinburgh forward made just 19 starts for the Owls, netting two league goals along the way., 23121=Date:Tuesday August 7 2007, 13022=Owls Set for Striker Joao?
