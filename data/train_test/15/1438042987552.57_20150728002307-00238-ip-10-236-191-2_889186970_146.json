            "I wouldn't know much about Greek life but I hear that it is not just partying and that UAB's Greek life is more studious than other colleges.",
            "If it's available, join the hacky sack club because I'm gonna try to found it! :)",
            "Great for people who love to be outdoors and like the convenience of walking everywhere you go.",
            "Every year there is a zombie festival thing that they hold across the entire campus.",
            "Overall UAB is awesome and I would definitely approve of it. But I would advise you to live in an apartment somewhere near campus.",
            "Definitely get out on the Green (A big open area in the middle of the campus) and do something like throw a Frisbee or have a picnic.",
            "The food is okay at UAB. There aren't enough places that accept meal plans but it is pretty decent food.",
            "I don't spend much time in my own dorm but I spend a lot of time in my friend's dorm. They are nice dorms, but they are super strict on letting people stay over.",
            "I've been very determined to make straight A's. Even though it's looking like I might not achieve that I'm actually pretty close to that.",
            "I would definitely advise incoming freshman to not slack off right away because it's hard to come back from it.",
            "This semester has been great so far! I have made new friends and have gotten good grades in my classes. It has been fun getting to know downtown Birmingham."

Non-medical students will take classes mostly in a two block area., 583106=They are are currently renovating the student center where Chick-Fil-A and Taco Bell were located. So the selection is somewhat limited, but you have three cafeteria based areas one of which that remains open till 1:00 A. M all of which also provide vegetarian options. There is also a nearby Subway and Starbucks that accept meal plans, dining dollars, or blazer bucks as well as numerous food trucks, vending machines, and Simply To Go food stations. Slightly off campus you have the entirety of downtown Birmingham at your disposal with Al's(mediterranean food), Maschino's(Smoothies), and 5th avenue which has the iconic Mellow Mushroom available., 513651=There are many restaurant options in and around the campus. With a dozen or more fast food places and sit-down restaurants. There is even a Cajun restaurant that sends a food van around campus that always smells like amazing seafood., 167126=The are many food options on campus. Chick Fil A and Taco Bell are right on campus and you can use your meal plans there! The Diner is open until 2:00 a.m for those nights that you have stayed up to study and now you are starving!, 52152=Anyone looking for a quality education will fit in at UAB. I'm so thankful and proud to be part of the LAST undergrad class of Health Information Management students at UAB - after I graduate in 2015, the program will become a masters program and no longer offered to undergrad students. This is still really cool though because UAB is one of very few colleges to offer HIM at all! If you want to be in the medical profession in any way, shape or form, UAB is your school. From dentistry, optometry, and medicine to nursing, health information management and psychology, UAB has everything any student could ever want in the way of a career in a health profession,, 701699=Despite being in the center of Birmingham, UAB feels like its in its own little bubble. UAB is also currently undergoing a lot of renovation, with a new freshman dorm and student centering being built for incoming students of 2015-2016. Lastly, UAB is arguable the best medical school in the state of Alabama., 468035=The food at UAB is pretty good. The only downside is that most of the resturant areas at UAB close fairly early and the only one open late is the Diner. But, like the name implies, the Diner mainly only sells diner food which isn't the most healthy thing to eat at 10:30 at night., 722336=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 83202=this college is one of the best colleges in the country, i visited during the summer of 2011 and had an amazing time the campus was beautiful and it is in the top 10 for most safest college, 348659=Do not plan classes at 6:45 am or 8:00 am if you are not a morning person. Pay attention to all deadlines from registration to a withdrawal date., 240297=I am very pleased with my education thus far at UAB. I feel fortunate to be there and look forward to graduating in 2015}",

However, it is now also an Art school as well. Therefore, UAB is great for all majors! Another great thing about UAB, is that we are ranked number THREE in the country for diversity. UAB has so much to offer, and you will love it here!",
