SWD was first reported in the state in August 2011 and caused severe economic injury to local farmers who had to halt sales of blueberries and raspberries for the remainder of the year. I have been working with Richard Cowles (Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station) on developing an Integrated Pest Management response for CT growers for the coming season. Various phagostimulants, attractants, insecticides and traps have been tested in the lab. This talk will go over the history, research, and future of IPM control of Spotted Wing Drosophila, 48821=Vanessa Boukili Refining ecological restoration techniques in the tropics Enrichment planting is a commonly used restoration technique, which is applied to increase species diversity or environmental services during forest regeneration. Our study provides guidance in selecting species for restoration activities, and is among the first to directly link species performance across different environmental conditions to easily measured plant functional traits. We used an experimental approach to test whether species\u2019 ecological characteristics influence the ability of seedlings to survive in three successional stages. In October 2010 we transplanted seedlings of six species (three secondary-growth specialists and three old-growth specialists) into old-growth forest, second-growth forest, and pasture plots at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. Secondary-growth specialists possess fast-resource acquisition traits- such as high specific leaf area and low leaf toughness- that promote fast growth rates. Old-growth specialists, on the other hand, possess resource-conservation traits that promote survival over growth. We monitored seedling survival monthly for 1.3 years. Growth rates of survivors were assessed after 6 and 16 months (final harvest will be completed in March 2012). We use logistic and linear statistical models to relate species survival and growth rates to leaf functional traits and environmental conditions in each plot.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Abstracts Name Title Abstract Dr. Massimo Pigliucci Keynote Address: On the many meanings of \"doing theory\" in biology \u201cTheoretical biology\u201d is a surprisingly heterogeneous field, partly because it encompasses \u201cdoing theory\u201d across disciplines as diverse as molecular biology, systematics, ecology and evolutionary biology. Moreover, it is done in a stunning variety of different ways, using anything from formal analytical models to computer simulations, from graphic representations to verbal arguments. In this talk I explore a number of aspects of what it means to do theoretical biology, and how they compare with the allegedly much more restricted sense of theory in the physical sciences. I also tackle a recent trend toward the presentation of all-encompassing theories in the biological sciences, from general theories of ecology to a recent attempt to provide a conceptual framework for the entire set of biological disciplines. Finally, I discuss the roles played by philosophers of science in criticizing and shaping biological theorizing.
