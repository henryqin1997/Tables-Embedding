Captivating lyrics and themes that resonate with the feelings of real life lend to this excellent work by a commercially overlooked band., 144916=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc. All rights reserved., 40219=Husker Du is a life changing band. I know there sound isn't for everyone, but I pity those who cannot appreciate how awesome this band was. I first heard this album at debate camp in 1987 (maybe 1988). The stuttering on \"It's Not Peculiar\" is what hooked me in. It did not sound like anything else on the radio, and wouldn't until the 1990s. Neither did their SST catalog, but for those who are not ready for DIY recording techniques, the sound of Husker Du's Warner Bros. catalog is a great place to become acquainted with their sound. This dense double album is a better place to start than the lesser Candy Apple Grey. \"These Important Years\", \"Could You Be The One?\". and \"You Can Live At Home\" are the standout tracks. However, I believe that this album is best treated like a novel or movie where you should listen to it in one full sitting., 37174=Along with The Replacements, H\u00fcsker D\u00fc represented all that was right with alternative rock in the '80s. (It was a shame that neither group could simply be known as a rock 'n' roll band, but the classic rock establishment didn't let many outsiders in the circle.) This double album was H\u00fcsker D\u00fc's second, and while it isn't as gut-wrenching as Zen Arcade, it remains true to the band's spirit. At this point in time\u20141986 and 1987\u2014the trio was falling apart, and songwriters Bob Mould and Grant Hart were feuding. Like many double albums, Warehouse could make a great single LP, though there's no unanimous agreement over which tracks would make the superior slimmed-down set. Mould's \"Could You Be the One?\" and \"Ice Cold Ice\" stand out as his clear highlights, while \"Friend, You've Got to Fall\" is allegedly about his bandmate. Hart's \"She's a Woman (And Now He Is a Man),\" \"She Floated Away,\" and \"Back from Somewhere\" are his strongest contributions.}",
