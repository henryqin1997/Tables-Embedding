            "Students who are involved in their community and ambitious. CLU works well with students of all backgrounds.",
            "If you are serious about school and also want a great colleg community, CLU is the place for you. CLU prides itself at looking at the whole individual--simple test scores and AP results don't cover the whole picture. Of course, if you did well on these, then there is a very high chance of acceptance. But be warned, do not rely heavily on these. Almost everyone I have met has performed numerous hours of community service. Take an interview. Let CLU see your true personality. Email and/or call admissions to really show your interest. To take advantage of all the opportunities CLU offers, you really need to get involved. It's not hard to do, in fact, you might even feel forced to go because of all the talk that goes around events advertised. Club Lu offers so many events and take advantage of them. They're part of the college experience, and honestly, they made me really like CLU. Even if there's something you want to start, notifiy the department and they are completely behind you--from funding to helping you organize your event. Take a campus tour and see meet the people there yourself. You won't be dissapointed. :]",
            "CLU offers a lot of scholarships, but what I noticed to be very different in comparison to other colleges was that all events hosted by CLU are FREE! Club Lu hosts so many activities each month that you forgot you're at school. Trips to Chuck E. Cheese's (including all you can eat free pizza and soda), trips to Dodger Games, and Beach outings are just a few events that I can name off the top of my head. Every event that you attend literally gives out so much free food, especially multicultural events.",
            "So many different activites to particpate in or watch. From theater department shows, to football games, CLU really does take care of their students. Also, because it's a small school, you get the advantage of really knowing a lot of people from all class levels.",
            "Attending CLU will teach you more than what you will be expecting to learn in a classroom environment. Teachers motivate their students to come during office hours to further discuss topics taught during class. Take Advantage of This Oppotunity!! At CLU, you learn from community service and multicultural events."

Professors here really care about your education and will get to know you on a personal level if you are willing. I have some of my professors numbers that are in my major and allow me to contact them if need be. The size of the classes are small with a ratio of about 17:1 (17 students to 1 professor)., 89404=there are many traditions that are unusual here, but one i think is the greatest is the undie run. mid to late october, everyone strips to their undies, gives the clothes they had on to charity, and then goes on a run around campus. it's all about the charity! there's a lot of cool locations that are around the campus, you just have to find them!, 172126=As of right now, our cafeteria is very sub-par. However, we do have a cafe called the Centrum, which is very convenient because you can get all kinds of food to go. We are in the process of building a new dining commons which is going to be VERY nice! It will be finished in 2015., 51305=Set in sunny Southern California where it is close to Malibu Beach, Six Flags, and Disneyland, as well as Downtown Hollywood. The student:professor ratio is generally 20:1 so the professors can offer one on one help and get to know the students' personalities and learning styles. Has extremely competitive Chemistry, Biology, and Communications programs with opportunities for internships at local hospitals and media companies in Hollywood., 162552=The food and dining is okay right now, however, in 2014 a new dinning commons is coming and it will all be updates and better., 52417=There is a cafe called the Centrum that does breakfast specialties, and provides salads, sandwiches, pizzas, and hamburgers for lunch and dinner. As of September 2014, there will be a brand new Cafeteria on campus with all kinds of food, and a coffee shop., 220302=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 126389=The dining options the school has now aren't horrible, but it does get redundant throughout the year. Cal Lu offers a traditional dining hall, Centrum (cafe style), Jamba Juice, Mogen Market (open 5pm-12am), and a small kiosk. Cal Lu is currently starting to rebuild a new two floor dining hall that is scheduled to be finished after summer 2014., 18155=California Lutheran can be expensive, but they are willing to help you. With numerous donors and out side sources I believe its over 85% of students that get some sort of financial aid. CLU already provides $19 million a year in financial aid to students, but in 2009-2010 it plans to increase the amount of scholarship money available to current students to help them meet educational expenses during the recession. source: http://www.callutheran.edu/news/news_detail.php?story_id=5453}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Somewhat conservative but creative! No drinking on campus by anyone, so don't come if you like to party with alcohol!! Great school for kids who like to travel abroad and who like mingling with their professors. Lots of just normal kids who are not there just to get ahead. Great school if you don't want to feel like a number! It has a very cohesive feel to it, like everyone enjoys being there. Tips for prospective students They like kids who are service-oriented (Boys Scouts, etc.) not just with high grades. Go to the interview, if you get invited, and share something great you have done to help your community. Bang for the buck I got a great scholarship and financial aid. They accommodated my parent's sudden loss of income with lots of help with finances! They go out of their way to help you afford the school. Am enjoying being here The staff and helpful upperclassmen were so helpful from day 1. They act like they want YOU on campus, not just your money!! They provide lots of support for freshman so they don't fail. You get a student and academic adviser to help you through the first year!",
