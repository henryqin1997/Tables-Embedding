Notably, prime lenses around 200mm or longer have not been tested as well as (at Mid-March 2013) the Nikon 70-200mm VR II lens. However, these will be added in the coming months as the labs get to do their testing., 27344=For a true super-zoom, the Nikon AF-S Nikkor 28-300mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR makes the best choice. 10P-Mpix is not great when compared to shorter focal lengths or prime lenses, but within the compromises of the super-zoom design, it is not a bad result. At $1050 though, it is the most expensive lens tested in this category, though it does include Nikon\u2019s VR system. Because of the high cost, unless you really need the extended focal range, you may do better to look elsewhere.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "The 70-200mm focal range is exceptionally popular \u2013 for good reason. This focal range covers a lot of requirements and is used regularly by photographers in most genres. As we\u2019ve seen, the fact that these lenses tend to perform better than other lenses within this class has also made them a favorite choice. 70-200mm Within this test group, the 70-200mm lenses are clearly the best choice for the highest image quality. The 70-200mm lenses perform remarkably well compared to other lenses tested. As expected, lenses with a large focal range, 70-300mm or 28-300mm super-zooms tend to show the lowest scores. As we\u2019ve seen in the standard lens test results, when using the Nikon D800, it pays to look for the best lenses, because the camera is so demanding of lens performance. As we\u2019d expect, when comparing the lenses in these groups to the best standard prime lenses, the telephoto models lose out. However, interestingly, the 70-200mm lenses do score approximately similarly to the standard zoom lenses, suggesting that optical quality is not dropping off that sharply in this focal range.",
    "textAfterTable": "The best 2 lenses tested are both Nikon models: in the Overall score, the\u00a0Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8G VRII and the Nikon 70-200mm f/4G ED VR come out on top with scores of 29 and 28, respectively. With a price of $1,399, the Nikon 70-200mm f/4 ED VR is not only a top choice, but also a good bargain \u2013 as much as a lens costing over $1,000 can be considered a bargain. The top three 70-200mm lenses so far tested on the Nikon D800, with the Nikon AF-S 70-200mm f/4G ED VR coming out top. If you need a faster maximum aperture than f/4, then the Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8 VR II is the best in its class. If the Nikon is out of your price range, the $770 Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8 Di LD (IF) and the less-recent $1,850 Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8G IF-ED both score a very good DxOMark score of 26. In all areas, the two are seemingly equal, so your choice will eventually come down to brand loyalty and price as much as any image quality concerns. The one thing to keep in mind is that the latest Tamrom 70-200mm f/2.8 lens has not yet been tested. Once the lens has had its turn going through our labs, we expect to",
