The construction of the inference rules is executed by an automatic rule construction method such as depicted in \"Handling of Qualitative Attributes in Automatic Construction of Fuzzy Inference Rules by using Input-Output Data\", Proceedings FD-7-3 of the 8th Fuzzy System Symposium, 1992. The automatic construction method automatically generates appropriate inference rules for approximating the input-output relation from an input and a data which contain qualitative attributes denoted by a string of symbols or characters such as a verbal noun and quantitative attributes represented by numerals., 34337=Advanced data retrieval methods have been developed for retrieving data in accordance with a personal standard of subjective judgment, e.g. human concepts like proper and convenient. In such data retrieval methods, a retrieval apparatus identifies specific criteria determined by user's requirements and executes a data retrieval action according to the criteria. For example, among them is a fuzzy retrieval system with a fuzzy connective operator depicted in \"Construction of Fuzzy Retrieval System with Learning-type Fuzzy Connective Operator\", the 1991 Electric and Information Institutes Joint Conference, Literature S4-1. The fuzzy connective operator is defined by Equation (1). Also, S and T in Equation (1) are expressed in Equation (2). ##EQU1##}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations According to the fourth embodiment of the present invention, the user can read and modify a desired data retrieval command to be reused. When the user requirements are varied during reuse of the data retrieval command, the data retrieval command can be modified to correspond to the varied requirements. According to the third embodiment of the present invention, any data retrieval command produced can be stored for reuse. The data retrieval command can be utilized whenever the same user requirements are involved. Accordingly, when the same user requirements are presented for data retrieval, it is unnecessary to repeat the generation of the data retrieval command. According to the second embodiment of the present invention, the data retrieval apparatus displays a data retrieval command thus allowing the user to examine, before starting the action of data retrieval, if the retrieval conditions represent the user requirements. If the retrieval conditions fail to represent the user requirements, a desired modification to the conditions can easily be made by producing and entering a corresponding edit command. According to the first embodiment of the present invention, the inference rules are constructed which can approximate the subjective criteria of the user at high precision, the data retrieval command is generated from the inference rules, and corresponding data are retrieved by the data retrieval command. The data retrieval command is consisted of an easily understandable form of the retrieval conditions using common equality",
