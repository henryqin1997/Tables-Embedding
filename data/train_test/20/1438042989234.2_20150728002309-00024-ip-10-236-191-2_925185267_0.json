    "textAfterTable": "Because sizing and cut will vary between brands, please use this chart as a general guide. If you are between sizes or need assistance selecting the proper size, please contact Customer Service Designer In 1999, designer Nancy Yoo created Fleur't lingerie based on a simple need: flirty, feminine lingerie that fits and feels good. Fleur't camisoles and lace-trimmed panties are comfortable enough for everyday yet beautiful enough for special occasions. Rendered in materials that stretch gently and softly, they conform to a variety of body types and are accented with delicate embroidery, whimsical appliqu\u00e9s, and rich colors, offering women a much-needed alternative to mainstream lingerie.
