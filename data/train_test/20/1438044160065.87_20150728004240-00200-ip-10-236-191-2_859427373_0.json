Line 3[edit] non bene advocatus - not well summoned A slight mistake in invocation may bring down the wrath of the gods Line 7[edit] meos amores - my loves Refers to Juventius, a young boy who Catullus chased for his affections. Homosexual affairs were a normal part of Roman life, and Juventius may have been a freedman or a slave, since it was not proper for a Roman man to have sex outside marriage with another Roman citizen. The use of the plural amores indicates the passion felt for Juventius. Line 8[edit] cum longa ... poena- Catullus predicts his poetry will be everlasting. Vocabulary[edit] Line 1[edit] quinam, quaenam, quodnam - what; tell me? mens, mentis f. - mind; reason misellus -a -um - (dim. of miser) poor; wretched Line 2[edit] ago, agere, egi, actum - to drive; urge praeceps,",
