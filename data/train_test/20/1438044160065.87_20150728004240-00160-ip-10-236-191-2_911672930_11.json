Bethany College is also the founding location for the Delta Tau Delta chapter. All sororities are on campus, while only 3 fraternities are on campus, with the rest located in town. The Greek Life plays just as big of a role in the college as the independates because of the greek to independate ration of 1:1., 13403=Bethany College had a history of having bad food, but now has multiple locations, and food types for the college community. The staff provide food for people with dietary restrictions and are willing to help out in anyway. Our cafeteria was just remolded in 2011 and now provides a better way to keep your food safe, and clean until it is on your plate. Hours of operation for all 3 dining locations are great because they fit with the students schedules., 54088=Seniors are required to take a senior comprehensive exam, which we have been told that only Ivy League schools practice this. They also have to complete a senior project. Freshman are required to return to a January term, that is a 3-hr class held once a day for about 3 weeks. After your freshman year, J term is only an option., 60228=The school offers trips to New York City, Chicago, amusement parks, they bring comedians and famous artists such as Andy Grammar., 64352=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students As you look for a college, you want to find somewhere that you feel comfortable, that fits you as an individual. The enrollment staff are great, they are quick to answer questions, the counselors will let you combine just about anything for a major. The small town atmosphere is really great to feel like you are a part of the campus. The sight is awesome too from the mountainside! Food is fabulous-made right then. Bang for the buck Even though the cost to come to Bethany is a little high, the rewards you receive as a student, the quality of student life, the individual attention, the numerous resources that are available to you, they make everything worth the payments. I looked at several other colleges that cost about the same in OH and KY and none compared to what I have available to me. Go Bethany!! Am enjoying being here When I came, I knew no one and felt a little uneasy. This college has allowed me to become involved in animal activities, riding sports, spend time with new found friends, watching presentations from the theater area and all kinds of professional entertainment brought in from outside the college Am learning a lot",
