There are handful of students (definitely not the majority) of people who dress up like hippies and may even walk around campus barefoot. Some people say that Arcata is a place that's like the 1960s just stopped in time. Arcata/Eureka is very secluded from pretty much everything, so there is certainly a niche community here. People here put an emphasis on being green, buying organic and local, and the farmer's market is a big deal. I didn't know really where to put this, but be aware that it rains a LOT up here during the rainy season. Bring a nice umbrella or raincoat- you'll use it a lot. Also (due to the rainy weather) there are times when you don't see the sun for prolonged periods of time. When I was there the longest period of no sun was maybe a week or so. Some people who have been there longer then me say (non-jokingly) that drinking milk is important because the lack of sun makes people depressed. A few years ago in August the sun didn't show for nearly the entire month. Just be aware. The nicest weather is in the summer and fall when school starts, with the rainy season beginning I would say in mid to late November and going on through to April or so., 393869=Hiking the forest, watching our 2012 GNAC champion football team play a game, walking into town to enjoy a farmers market; these are just a few of the fun filled activities there is to do in Arcata., 571954=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 58788=I am going into my Junior year and I have almost completed my General Education classes. I am excited to get past this milestone, but at the same time I am really going to miss taking classes that are not applicable to my major, but where I learn so much about the real world and things that I can apply to my everyday life. I took the required communications class and I absolutely loved it even though I have never been a huge fan of public speaking, there was so much interesting history about the art of rhetoric and my classmates all had such intriguing speech topics that I learned a lot from as well. I took a couple history classes, one about the United States from 1877 to the present and one on Rock and Roll as an American Music and I did not think that I would love them as much as I did. I have always just gotten by history in school before, but in these classes I could not wait for the next class period so that I could soak up even more information than the class before. The teachers are so amazing at the way they present the information; it's not a boring lecture, its a fun, interactive way of learning and even if you try not to learn anything from them, they will surprise you and you'll walk away in shock from how much information you soaked up without even trying!, 85692=our mascot is the lumberjack, however we do not have a real lumberjack at games and what not. we do have the marching lumberjacks, a type of school marching band, who provide awesome school spirit as they march around and play fun and exciting songs.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students People who like the outdoors and nature, people who are looking for a smaller to medium sized school with small classes and hands on experience, people who are on a budget. Tips for prospective students Wear comfortable shoes! Depending on where your classes are, there can be a lot of hills and stairs to climb! Bang for the buck There's quite a few classes to pick from and they're all small in size, which I think helps students learn a little bit better. It doesn't cost too much, although the fees just got increased and a few classes are getting cut or made bigger in size. Other than that, I would say it's a really great price for what you're getting from Humboldt! Am enjoying being here The campus is gorgeous and if you like nature and the outdoors, then it would be a good place for you. It also gives you a lot of hands on experience when you're in classes that deal with nature and the outdoors. The atmosphere at Humboldt is pretty laid back. The students and teachers are really friendly for the most part. Am learning a lot",
