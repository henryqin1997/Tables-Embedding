            "The campus itself is safe but crimes committed in IV seem to overshadow this since it is literally steps away from campus. The safety concern would be in IV not on campus unless you have a bike that isn't lock correctly.",
            "Great for students who want to work hard and play hard. Gauchos work hard during the week, go to class, study, and take tests just as any other college student would, but the difference between us and others is our reputation for being a party school. Yes, the weekends are usually filled with parties to attend but we know the times that are suitable to do either.",
            "Tortilla throwing at the soccer games is a huge tradition",
            "To live in the dorms costs more that the total tuition for an instate resident. It's ridiculous. I think they believe that they can charge more because of location but they are sucking me dry. The tuition is reasonable and on that end I feel that I am getting my money's worth considering the good professors and tons of resources here for me to use (try to use as many as you can because whether or not you do you still get billed for it).",
            "Party in IV but if you're not a big party-goer, there are always alternative events put on by the RAs in each dorm that you can go to which are pretty fun with free food. Explore Santa Barbara since UCSB really isn't in Santa Barbara but in a town called Goleta. There are tons to do downtown like shopping, museums, music venues, and the movies. And there is always the beach!",
            "The first couple weeks that I was here the food was great, but as the quarter progressed it seemed as if they ran out of ideas. The dishes are never cleaned completely so be careful when just picking one up and using it without inspection. Although they have the same stuff week after week, it still tastes appetizing but eventually regardless of what is being served you will become sick of the food. On the bright side, the desserts are always on point.",
            "The dorms are relatively small (I have a triple) and if you don't get along with your roommates or have problems with personal space, it may be a problem for you. The people in my dorm are pretty chill so I don''t spend a lot of time in my actual room so I do feel the smallness.",
            "So far, it hasn't been too challenging. I am a pre-biology student in the typical classes (general chemistry, calculus, lab). There are several resources available to you that failing isn't an option. Last quarter, I went to tutoring twice a week through CLAS (Campus Learning Assistance Services) and ended up with an A in my Calculus class and a B in Chem 1A.",
            "Do your research, ask current students, and visit before committing to any college. In the long run you will be satisfied with your choice."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{40863=There are four different dining commons at UCSB and each has its own specialty. De La Guerra (DLG) specializes in Mexican food, Ortega always has sushi at lunch and dinner, Carillo's specialty is Mongolian barbeque and Portola always has different types of bars (chili bar, burger bar). There are also always vegetarian and vegan options at every meal. Ortega provides take-out sack breakfasts or lunches for students who don't have time to sit down to a full meal in between classes (or if you want to have lunch on the beach after class with friends!). DLG also has late-night dining from 9pm to midnight on weeknights and serves everything that is not very healthy for you like burgers and fries (but that's all you really want at 9 o'clock at night anyway!). It's fun to take a break from cramming for finals to grab a bite to eat. The dining commons post their menus for the week online, which is nice because you can check which dining commons has the best food for that evening. Also, if you have certain allergies (nuts, gluten, milk, etc) or a food lifestyle (vegan or vegetarian) there is an online program where you can see what options fit your needs at each dining commons for that meal. All dining commons have a salad bar, fruit, breads, cereals, stuff to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and pizza. The quality of the food is actually quite good! I was expecting average cafeteria-style food and was pleasantly surprised with how good the food is. As far as meal plans go, students have several options. If you live on campus you are required to have a meal plan. Students can choose from have 10 meals per week, 14 meals per week, 17 meals per week or unlimited meals per week. I would recommend 14 meals per week because it keeps you covered by the dining commons meals, but is flexible enough that you can go out to eat with friends if you want. By meals these are meals you are allowed to use in the campus dining commons. You also have the option of adding $300, $600 or $900 to your ID card to use at the other campus dining locations such as Subway, Panda Express, Wahoo's Fish Tacos, Woodstock's, Root 217, Nicoletti's Coffee, and Jamba Juice. If you do not live on campus, you can get a meal plan if you wish (5 or 10 meals per week). The only thing I don't like about the dining at UCSB is that your leftover meals don't rollover and guest meals are not included in your plan-- you have to pay those separately. Other than that, dining is superb., 650979=Super beautiful school! Definitely hoping to attend UCSB in the fall of 2013 and become a Gaucho!, 568392=The university's average SAT score was 1923 and their average GPA was 4.07. UC Santa Barbara puts a strong emphasis on research, which may potentially allow a student to earn class credit or even money (in the form of grants, scholarships, or an assistant's pay)., 556116=I recently got my classes for Fall 2012, and I can say that I got all of the classes I wanted. It would be harder to do this at a community college., 563653=The average GPA of incoming students is about 3.9 and the average SAT score is 1900. So be prepared to endure that rigor!, 1140323=Duh,the beach. There`s also bowling,drive-in theater,butterflies that visit in February,hiking,social life in IV, and other great things., 896807=The Undie Run: happens once a quarter during finals week. Students donate their clothing and then run the campus in their undies! Beginning of the year and end of the year concerts: sponsored by the university students do not have to pay!! We've had Drake, Snoop Dog, Kendrick Lamar, Dada Life and more, 137167=If you are definitely coming to UCSB then my number one tip would be to attend the Freshman Summer Start Program (FSSP). It's the summer before you freshman year and it's basically summer school. If you're saying to yourself Ptch, yeah right. Why would I take summer school before I'm even in college? I'll just say it again... SIGN UP! I didn't do it and it's a huge regret of mine. It will make your life so much easier. Honestly no matter where you go I'm sure they have programs like this. I come from a really small town and I think I only came in with 8.0 units (the equivalent of two classes). There are kids coming in who are already sophomores because of all the AP classes they took in high school. And summer school is something you should do every year. First of all, it's insanely fun to be in Isla Vista over the summer. And second of all spreading your units over a few extra quarters will make your life immensely easier. It is almost a must if you're going to study abroad and is also essential if you're thinking about graduating early. Summer sessions are either six or three weeks long depending on which ones you choose and you take one or two classes. Classes over summer are WAY easier than they are during the regular school year. Have to take Chemistry or Biology? Finish it in six weeks instead of ten, it'll be easier, and you'll be able to have fun during the regular school year. Speaking of studying abroad, do it. I'm leaving for Thailand in August and I can't wait. I recommend doing it your Junior year which I would have done, except that I didn't do summer school so I had to finish enough units. Out of everyone I know who's graduated already, if any of them say they have regrets it's always that they didn't study abroad. Also, there is NOTHING WRONG with going to a community college for the first two years then transferring as a junior. Seriously. No matter where you go. You save so much money and General Ed classes are the same everywhere. If I had a chance to do it over again I would do that instead.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students I highly suggest visiting the campus before making a final decision. Honestly, I was barely considering attending UCSB, but decided to visit the school just to make sure I could cross it off my list. After spending one day on the campus and talking to current students, I was completely infatuated with the school and very confident that UCSB was the place for me. Also, I recommend that all students opt to stay in the dorms for Freshman year. It is really the best way to meet people and start acclimating to college life. Bang for the buck This is a tough issue to discuss, especially with the current budget cuts that are effecting the entire UC system - and in actuality, all of California. The school has a wide variety of programs to offer, but the deal of a public university is not quite as appealing as it used to be, and will continue to get worse. Tuition has just been set to increase, which brought major controversy to this and all UC campuses. Additionally, they are cutting one of UCSB's favorite minor programs - Exercise and Sport Sciences. This includes Nutrition and Health classes, as well as classes in a multitude of sports and exercise classes. It is hard to say what else will have to be cut during this time of economic emergency,",
