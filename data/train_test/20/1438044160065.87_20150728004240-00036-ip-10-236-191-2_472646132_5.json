The filter mouth is sprung open by tethers fixed at one end to a static tube. A rod extends through the filter to its apex. The filter opens based upon the relative position of the filter apex on the rod (which extends beyond the apex to form the distal end of the guide wire) and the static tube., 49561=[0001] This is a regular patent application based upon provisional patent application No. 60/440,932, filed Jan. 17, 2003.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0150] It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited to what has been particularly shown and described herein above. In addition, unless mention was made above to the contrary, it should be noted that all of the accompanying drawings are not to scale. A variety of modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention, which is limited only by the following claims. [0149] An important feature of the present invention is that the proximal actuator need not be axially threaded onto or off of the guide wire-actuator sleeve system. The proximal actuator is removably mounted to the tube in a tube or wire over a wire system by transversely or laterally attaching the proximal actuator at a desired location on the guide wire-actuator sleeve. Thereafter, axial movement of the first and second movable members (that is, the wire within the tube) is achieved by moving the first and second retainer of the proximal actuator away from each other. A variety of medical devices can be moved at the distal end of the wire in a tube system such as frames (discusses extensively above), balloons, cutting tools, stents, etc. [0148] The expandable frame 200 is closed by rotating the control actuator 332 in a counter-clockwise direction (or",
