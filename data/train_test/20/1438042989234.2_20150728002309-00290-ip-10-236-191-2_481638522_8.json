This step in FIG. 1 is the Movie Exporter 120 that extracts all data relevant to a Movie and stores it in a compact Movie Export File 122 suitable for transfer to Movie viewers using a different computer. The process for creating this Movie Export File 122 relies upon the Database Schema of FIG. 3. First the user selects the field MovieName from the Movies table 316. Then the Movie Exporter 120 selects all rows in the MoviesEventJunction 318 that match on the field MovieName. Then the Movie Exporter extracts all rows from BaseEvents table 300 that match these selected rows in MoviesEventJunction 318. Then the Movie Exporter follows the remaining relationships in FIG. 3 to extract all rows in Snapshot Events 314, Projects 302, EventClassifications 304, Snapshots 312, EventPredecessorJunction 306, AttachmentEventJunction 310 and Attachments 308 that are referenced by the selected rows in BaseEvents 300. Next the Movie Exporter compresses all of these rows and stores them in the Movie Export File 122 so that they can later be extracted as the Database Subset. Finally, the Movie Exporter copies and compresses all the Attachment files in the Attachment Repository 113 that are referenced by the selected rows in the Attachments table 308 into a subset of Attachment files for the Movie and places them in the Movie Export File 122 so that they can later be extracted as the Attachment Repository Subset.}",

Note that other attributes of the Persistent Events could also change as a result of the change from one Snapshot to the next. These other attributes include the color of the Marker, the type of Marker used, the Swim Lane, the icons showing the existence of Attachments, the icons showing Dependencies, etc., 113884=Propagated the Temporal Dependency of Event 2014 upon Event 2012 (these two Events have a \u201cStart-to-Finish\u201d dependency and Event 2014 has fixed Duration), thereby pushing both the StartTime and the EndTime of Event 2014 to later Times., 113312=Propagated the Temporal Dependency of Event 2010's EndTime upon Event 2008's EndTime (these two Events have a \u201cFinish-to-Finish\u201d dependency), thereby pushing the EndTime of Event 2010 to a later Time., 43368=Hereafter, since the invention treats past events and past plans in a unified manner, an \u201cEvent\u201d will refer to something that either happened in the past, began in the past, or is a task in a plan. Hereafter a \u201cMovie\u201d will refer to the animated presentation of these Events. For some Movies only the Event date is relevant whereas for other Movies both the Event date and Event time are relevant. To be consistent, the combined date-time of an Event (e.g. Jul. 17, 2006 5:35:22 pm) will be referred to as its \u201cTime.\u201d In any place in this patent description where the word \u201cdate\u201d appears in a database field definition or field description, it shall be understood to mean Time in the sense defined here., 124765=Engine 2310, 61658=Causal Dependency: A Dependency between two Events A and B in which the user has created a connection between A and B, with one of them being denoted by the user as the \u201ccause\u201d and the other being denoted as the \u201ceffect.\u201d For example, the user may connect Event A, \u201cthe power failed at 6:00 p.m. on July 10\u201d with Event B, \u201cthe meat in the freezer was found to be spoiled when inspected at 4:00 p.m. on July 11.\u201d, 113566=Propagated the Temporal Dependency of Event 2012's EndTime upon Event 2010's EndTime (these two Events have an \u201cFinish-to-Finish\u201d dependency and Event 2012 has fixed duration), thereby pushing both the StartTime and the EndTime of Event 2012 to later Times., 123787=Movie Importer 2302, 115599=Displayed a list of icons 2020 representing the entire sequential set of Snapshots that pertain to the Movie being displayed and optionally highlighted the Nov. 17, 2005 Snapshot as the current Snapshot.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Thus it can be appreciated that the above-described embodiments are illustrative of just a few of the numerous variations of arrangements of the disclosed elements used to carry out the disclosed invention. Moreover, while the invention has been particularly shown, described and illustrated in detail with reference to preferred embodiments and modifications thereof, it should be understood that the foregoing and other modifications are exemplary only, and that equivalent changes in form and detail may be made without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention as claimed, except as precluded by the prior art. , the only change being that the steps are carried out on the Attachment Repository Subset 2306 and the Database Subset 2308 rather than on the Attachment Repository 113 and the Database 106. Because the steps for Engine 2310 are identical to the steps for Engine 118, the description of these steps will not be repeated here. FIG. 1 The Engine 2310 controls the playback of the imported Movie and displays it to the user on the Movie Viewing Computer 2300, allowing the user to view the animated presentation of Events and to explore Events' Attachments and Dependencies. The steps executed by the Engine 2310 are identical to the steps executed by the Engine 118 of the Movie-Creation System of Engine 2310 but contains only those rows in each table that correspond",
