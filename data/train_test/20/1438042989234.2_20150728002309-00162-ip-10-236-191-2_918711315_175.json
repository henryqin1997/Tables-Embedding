            "Coffman Student Center shows FREE movies every Thursday through Saturday, and they are usually very popular movies, like the new Spiderman, Hunger Games, and the new James Bond movie. There is also a bowling alley in the student center. On campus, there is a program that organizes safe and fun college activites, called Gophers After Dark. The recreation center has many options for group and solo activities. There are a plethora of clubs and student organizations one can get involved in, such as History Club and Dance Club.",
            "There are a plethora of venue options both on campus and just outside of campus (across the street). There is an extensive variety of cuisine offered. There are dining cafeteria areas open for sharing a dining experience. Costs are approximately equivalent to what one would pay at a standard quick-stop restaurant, like Subway.",
            "I lived in a dorm at the University of Minnesota Morris campus, not at the Twin Cities campus. I have visited the dorm at the Twin Cities campus, however. Dorm life is an excellent way to become close to your fellow classmates, as you are close in proximity and readily available for study sessions and fun activites. Rooms are not grandly spacious, but living with a roommate can be a fun way to get to know somebody, and to learn about what qualities would make YOU a good roommate.",
            "If you took Advanced Placement classes in high school, the academic rigor is similar. There is ALWAYS more you can get out of a class, and the more effort you invest into your classes, the more advantagous and intriguing they will be. Students are expected to analyze many reading texts, apply class concepts, articulate and synthesize their knowledge in essays and creative projects, and participate in stimulating topical discussions.",
            "Get to know your professors! There are programs that allow you to take them to lunch (for free), and visiting their office hours shows interest and helps you start to learn about other opportunities, maybe in other departments or through the professor's connections. Professors are very involved in their classes and are delighted to get to know their students and help them as they explore their education. Utilize the opportunities for connection that are available--they are an invaluable resource and can help you clarify the trajectory of your career and enhance your college experience.",
            "The University of Minnesota has a daunting enrollment of over 50,000 students, but the campus is much more community-oriented than that number implies. We see familiar students and friends regularly, and it is easy to develop relationships with your classmates and professors. There are many research opportunities here at the University, which is an asset because it allows you to be a part of the current studies that are most relevant to you."

However, make sure to apply before the priority deadline, usually in early December. Look up additional scholarships on the website., 43041=It is best to apply early to the University, usually before their priority deadline in mid December. Your application will be viewed early and as a result given a better chance to be accepted into your college of choice and potential for University scholarships. After choosing to attend to the U of M, it is definitely worth it to live in the dorms for the first year. In the dorms, you have the opportunity to meet alot of people while getting adjusted to campus life. Also, don't worry if you are nervous. Everyone else is in the same boat you are. Just be yourself and be open to new things. It is definitely beneficial to go to class. It may be tempting to just skip some classes, but you will likely find that you will miss more material that you imagined. Also, don't be afraid to meet your professors. They actually like to get to know their students and it can come in handy later when you need a reference or letter of recommendation. Finally, get involved! You will have fun doing something you like while also meeting people. These people may become great friends later on or lead you to someone who can help you down the road in life., 147194=I can't think of a single student who found the academic rigor at the U of M to be lacking. Some courses will naturally be easier than others (especially 1000-level ones); however, those will be worth fewer credit hours in order to reflect that. Also worth iterating is the fact that the common misconception of science and math classes being more difficult is not necessarily true here; as a foreign language major, I can attest to the fact that As are not just handed out willy-nilly. All subject areas require work; there are no easy majors\u00e2??., 999561=The University of Minnesota is a very good school, it is ranked one of the top 10 research universities when I started attending in 2005. The classes are quite large and so you would need to develop a very healthy studying schedule to keep up with course work. That or you can visit the professors during office hours., 36546=The class content depends a bit on what the class is. Especially for first-year classes (1000 level), there are the joke classes that only require a bit of realizing what the professor wants. Good news (maybe...?), however, is that this changes a lot with higher level courses (starting even with the 2000 level ones). All of my professors so far do know their material; when signing up for classes during orientation, try to get into more advanced classes and to pick professors that have won the Morse Award or some other designation. All of that said, what someone learns depends mostly on that person's effort put into the class., 413694=On the East Bank of the Minneapolis campus we have the Weisman Art Museum. This building stands out from any other building on campus because of its postmodern architecture. It was just reopened in the fall of 2011 after it underwent a major expansion project. The museum now has many more works of art on display than it ever had before., 929488=I'd definitely give the University a 9.5 out of 10. I've actually been living here since the beginning of June and honestly I feel welcomed everyday I'm here. The University of Minnesota is full of fun, energetic, and friendly people that make up the rate 9.5, 347397=just a warning: the light rail won't be done until 2015 which blocks off all of washington ave., 770830=There's lots of cheap dates. There's a telescope on the physics building that is free to use after 8 o'clock and they show free movies in one of the buildings before the movies come out on video., 1062419=There are crime alerts that go on and it is very convenient that the university will text you on your phone and email you. Also you can call someone walk with you at night if you feel unsafe, you just call an escort. In addition there is the Gopher Chauffeur that takes calls till 2:00 AM., 929067=If you want to get into the University of Minnesota feel proud. The U of MN had 43,000 applicants for the incoming class of 2017, and only 5500 applicants were accepted. Definitely take your application seriously and meet every deadline.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Anna from Shawano, WI 07/25/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 24 out of 28 people found this review useful. 1 person found this inaccurate. 2 of 269 Categories Comments Great for these types of students The U of M is a school for every type of student. Seriously, it might sound cliche, but whether you are all about studying and keeping the grades up in hopes to go far, or are just testing the waters and taking some classes, coming back from years off of school, or just winging it... there are a million more students just like you and life on and around campus has stuff for everyone :) Tips for prospective students I was so scared as an incoming freshman, because nobody from my high school or town lived in the cities, so I thought I would never meet anyone. Believe me, when you get to school it is so easy to meet and get along with everyone on campus, and you can't let yourself worry for one second. Everyone is in the exact same boat as you are, and it will all go way",
