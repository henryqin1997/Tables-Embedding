The Eagles had beaten Bullitt East 76-59 in the opening round of the King of the Bluegrass Tournament. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0On Saturday night Eastern beat Ballard for the LIT title. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Bullitt East head coach Troy Barr didn\u2019t think his team was emotionally or physically drained for the game against Eastern after the Chargers upset top-ranked Jeffersontown 56-54 a day earlier in overtime. Actually, Eastern and Jeffersontown came into the LIT sharing the top-ranking in the state in the most recent computer numbers. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI really didn\u2019t see it that way,\u201d the veteran coach said of any letdown by his team after the big win the day before. \u201cWe didn\u2019t shoot it well and they did. When they shoot like that, nobody can beat them. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThey are too quick and too good and too athletic to beat if they shoot like that,\u201d Barr added. \u201cNobody can beat them.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Eastern didn\u2019t really shoot the lights out by the numbers. The Eagles were 32 of 63 from the field, but the team seemed to make every big shot that was needed. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Bullitt East battled through any letdown in the first half and after trailing by as many as 14 points early in the second quarter, the Chargers got back within nine points in the final minute of the half. Eastern then played for a final shot over the last 30 seconds and connected on a mid-range jumper by Remy Abell. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0It was still an 11-point margin early in the second half when Eastern stepped back and drained three straight treys including back-to-back baskets by Arman Marks. Moments later, Abell hit another three-pointer and when Lyonell Gaines got inside for a basket, Eastern had a 46-26 lead and the outcome was no longer in doubt. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHonestly, that\u2019s the guy we wanted to shoot the threes,\u201d Barr said of Marks. \u201cWhat we heard is that his percentage is not that good. Give him credit. That is what opened up the game.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Marks had four of the six three-pointers that Eastern connected on in the win. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe can\u2019t match up with them one-on-one,\u201d Barr pointed out. \u201cWe have to let him have some of those shots and hope he misses. He made those shots today.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0How good is Eastern, a team ranked 34th in the country in one national poll? The Eagles raced up and down the floor for 88 points on Saturday morning and turned the ball over just four times. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Bullitt East couldn\u2019t keep up the pace. For the game, the red and gold converted just 13 of 39 shots. In the first half, the rebounding numbers were even at 18-18. In the second half, Eastern outrebounded the Chargers 22-8. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Against Jeffersontown the night before, Bullitt East had gotten a lot of mileage out of its 2-3 zone defense. On Saturday morning, the Chargers started in a triangle-and-two formation. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe didn\u2019t block out of it very well,\u201d Barr lamented. \u201cWe work on that, but sometimes young defenses don\u2019t rebound well.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Eastern was led by seniors Abell and Gaines with 18 points each while the team got 12 points from Marks and ten points from Byron Sanford. Abell has already singed to play at Bradley next season while Gaines will be playing at IUPUI. Kameron Woods, who has signed with Butler, had just four points in this game for the Eagles. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The Chargers answered with 14 points and eight rebounds from sophomore Derek Willis while senior Hayden Sweat had 11 points. Rusty Troutman had nine points and seven rebounds. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Bullitt East had never won a game in the Louisville Invitational Tournament in four previous trips. Getting two wins this time was a big step forward. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt was a great experience,\u201d Barr concluded. \u201cI was disappointed that the first was moved to Doss (because of bad weather earlier in the week). We wanted to get on this floor (at Bellarmine which will also be the site of the Sixth Region Tournament in March). \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis was a great stage and a positive experience,\u201d the coach added. \u201cThis is disappointing, but the last 12 hours have been a lot of fun.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The Chargers have just a short time to shake off any LIT cobwebs. The team will be back in action on Tuesday at home against Nelson County and later in the week will host Spencer County on Thursday before hosting North Bullitt on Friday for homecoming.
