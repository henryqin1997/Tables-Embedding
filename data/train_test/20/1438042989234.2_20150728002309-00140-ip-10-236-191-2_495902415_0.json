(To exhibit at the state fair, they must be at least 12 years old and not over 19. Younger members are limited to just one entry until age 14.) The county/club/organization is still involved. They are contacted to verify the enrollment eligibility of the youth in its program, but only after the entries have been submitted. The goal is to allow some of the counties with lower quota to be able to bring more animals and exhibitors to the show. The quota system was not very flexible. If there was a surge of new youth in the county, they might have to wait awhile to be able to show.}",
