            "Attend Sport events Hang with friends Play video games",
            "SU can use major improvement in this area. Most College students miss their mom's cooking any way, so SU could at least make the food look and taste good some of the time. Oh I forgot Prospective Students bring money to eat out.",
            "We have very nice new dorms and apartments in the back of the campus, but if you are not lucky enough to stay in one of those all the other dorms are not the best living arrangements.",
            "SU gives you the option to take on line or classroom setting classes, tutors are available, and if the class is just not for you, SU give you ample time to withdraw. But you have remember, this is not High School and you have to be self motivated to get your work done.",
            "You will need to have the patience of Job (Bible reference) to deal with things at SU. You might also want to bring a car",
            "SU needs a lot of help in bring the staff and processes up to date. We need to work on taking care of the low hanging fruit first (i.e remove vacant building, paint doors). There in a need to improve the facuilty and student relationship"

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Get your money's worth. Some students may get frustrated and overwhelmed with college, but if you actually do the math, you're being paid to go to college and in the end you'll be the one getting paid for your skills acquired from college. Don't waste time, a lazy hand is for a poor man, a diligent hand holds wealth. Am enjoying being here I enjoy SU! Its a very comfortable environment, like home. There are special events like homecoming and the never ending parties, but if you're not comforable there are also more relaxing places like the library or the bluff. Am learning a lot Southern University offers a variety of majors and potential career fields. I must say the quality of the education is great and worth while. The Professors, students, and others have been very helpful.
