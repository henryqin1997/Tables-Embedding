It was also used to control roadside and railway grasses. Dalapon is no longer contained in any registered pesticide products in the United States, and all uses have effectively been canceled by EPA (Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB) 2003c). Dalapon is found in our drinking water as a result of its direct application onto grasses and crops. Reporting of environmental releases is not required for dalapon, so no release estimates are available. Exposure to dalapon has produced kidney damage in rats, and kidney damage, throat irritation and weight loss in cows. The compound has also been found to be toxic to mallard eggs (California Environmental Protection Agency 1997c). Dalapon is an herbicide used on roads, railway tracks and other rights of way.

Source: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 200\u00a0ppb Maximum Contaminant Limit Goal (MCLG) A non-enforceable health goal that is set at a level at which no known or anticipated adverse effect on the health of persons occurs and which allows an adequate margin of safety.
