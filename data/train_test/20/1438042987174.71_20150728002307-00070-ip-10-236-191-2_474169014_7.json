No. 60/003,853, filed Sep. 15, 1995., 18450=The original styrene-diene products were based on KRATON\ufffd D-1111 polymer (SIS) which at that time had a higher styrene content than the commercially available 15 percent styrene SIS polymers. Later, higher styrene content polymers such as STEREON\ufffd 840 polymer (SBS) and KRATON\ufffd D-1122 polymer (branched SBS) were used. The use of these high styrene products was driven by the desire to have a lower melt viscosity and lower processing temperature in disposables assembly. In the past, the lower limit on the operating temperature has been defined by the temperature at which the hot melt adhesive could be applied with sufficiently low viscosity for even and proper application. Such temperatures were in the range of 300\ufffd F. to 350\ufffd F. The industry would like to operate at from about 250\ufffd F. to about 300\ufffd F. That trend continues and has become particularly important in the Japanese market where the need for lower melt viscosity adhesives for disposables assembly is combined with the strong preference for hydrogenated polymers (SEBS and SEPS, where EB is a hydrogenated butadiene block and EP is a hydrogenated isoprene block) because of their increased stability and resistance to heat and oxidation., 35140=Optional components of the present invention are stabilizers which inhibit or retard heat degradation, oxidation, skin formation and color formation. Stabilizers are typically added to the commercially available compounds in order to protect the polymers against heat degradation and oxidation during the preparation, use and high temperature storage of the composition. Combinations of primary and secondary antioxidants are preferred. Such combinations include sterically hindered phenolics with phosphites or thioethers, such as hydroxyphenylpropionates with aryl phosphates or thioethers, or amino phenols with aryl phosphates. Specific examples of useful antioxidantcombinationsinclude3-(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate)methane (Irganox\ufffd 1010 from Ciba-Geigy) with tris(nonylphenyl)-phosphite (Polygard\ufffd HR from Uniroyal), Irganox\ufffd 1010 with bis(2,4-di-t-butyl)pentaerythritol diphosphite (Ultranox\ufffd 626 from Borg-Warner)., 39280=A polymer blend was made with 88% by weight of LIQUID KRATON LVSI 101 polymer, an unhydrogenated 30,000 weight average molecular weight, 15% polystyrene content (PSC) diblock copolymer of styrene and isoprene and the balance KRATON\ufffd G1652 polymer, a hydrogenated 50,000 weight average molecular weight, 12% PSC triblock copolymer of styrene and butadiene. 200 parts by weight of the blend of ESCOREZ\ufffd 5380, a hydrogenated dicyclopentadiene tackifying resin was added to 100 parts by weight of the blend along with 1 part by weight of IRGANOX\ufffd 1010 antioxidant. The blend had a solution viscosity of 84 cps at 350\ufffd F. using a Brookfield viscometer.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes This experiment proves that the adhesive of this invention will make a good adhesive for disposables. It also proves that the adhesive will bond at as low as 190\ufffd F. and would also be a good low temperature heat seal adhesive. A 1 mil thick layer of this blend was coated onto a piece of polyethylene film at about 130\ufffd to 150\ufffd F. A second piece of polyethylene was put on over the top of the blend. Room was left at the edges so that the two layers of polyethylene could be grasped. The construction was heated in an oven to 190\ufffd F. and rolled with a one pound pressure roller and then cooled to room temperature. The layers were then grasped by hand and pulled apart. If the layers were to peel along the adhesive, the adhesive would be insufficiently strong. If the polyethylene tore, then destructive tear would have occurred and the adhesive is acceptable. In this case, destructive tear was observed and thus, the adhesive was acceptable.
