For the year ended December 31, 2004, approximately 56% of our revenues originated from Europe (of which approximately 26% originated outside Germany), 36% originated from Asia and 8% originated from North and South America., 621255=We have adopted a code of ethics (\u201cCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\u201d) applicable to our officers, directors and employees, pursuant to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The text of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is provided on our Internet website (www.dialog-semiconductor.com)., 633718=Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, 438217=PETER WEBER joined us on February 1, 2006 bringing to the company 35 years of experience in the semiconductor sector. He has gained his experience of the high-tech industry with a broad range of companies, including Texas Instruments, Intel, Siliconix, the Temic Group and Netro Corporation. During his 35 years in the industry he has held a number of general management and senior marketing roles at these companies, both in Germany and Silicon Valley. Since 1998 he has been an investor and management consultant, serving on the boards of a number of companies in Europe and the US. He holds a MSEE degree in communications engineering., 630139=13.1Section 1350 Certification of Chief Executive Officer of the Company in accordance with Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.(6), 198226=While we reported an operating profit and net income for the 2000 fiscal year, we incurred net losses of \u20ac23,345,000, \u20ac6,222,000, \u20ac20,420,000, \u20ac10,208,000 and \u20ac41,386,000 for fiscal years 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. We cannot assure you that our net losses will not continue or increase in the future or that we will return to being profitable. Please see \u201cItem 3. Key Information\u201d and \u201cItem 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects\u201d for information regarding our financial condition., 518449=On September 24, 2004, the Company completed an offering of 2,000,000 previously unissued ordinary shares at \u00a30.10 per share to its employee benefit trust, to make such shares available for the exercise of stock option rights that had previously been granted to employees., 859658=Marketable securities at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively consist of exchange traded funds that are classified as available-for-sale and are accounted for on the basis of the settlement date and recorded at fair value as determined by the most recently quoted market price of each security at the balance sheet date. Unrealized gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities are determined on a specific-identification basis. Any impairment losses on available-for-sale security are charged to earnings. Interest income is recognized when earned. All securities are measured at fair values that are determined based on observable market prices or rates., 441021=MASAYUKI SUZUKI joined in December 2005 as President and representative director of Dialog Semiconductor KK.\u00a0 He has more than\u00a030 years experience in the semiconductor industry, gained in various senior level sales, marketing and management positions at Fairchild, LSI Logic and Chartered Semiconductor\u00a0in Japan., 849262=Therefore, for the first time, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS and its interpretation adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as of December 31, 2005. Based on these standards, management has applied the accounting policies as set out below., 636064=In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and of the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the EU (\u201cIFRS\u201d)., 147647=(1)Includes provision for excess inventory of \u20ac1,930 and \u20ac10,689 for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively., 628791=4.2Amendment Agreement with Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Pte., Ltd. dated December 18, 2001. (4) (5), 410807=Please refer to Note 2 and Note 20f to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our significant accounting policies and the new accounting pronouncements that we had not adopted by December 31, 2005 in accordance with IFRS and US GAAP., 235910=We have successfully developed a strong, focused customer base in Europe and Asia. In order to support and service our growing customers, we will consider expansion through organic growth and selected acquisitions. To this end, we have established design centers in Graz, Austria and Tokyo, Japan. Also, to support our growing customer base in greater China we recently, in the first quarter of 2005, opened a new office based in Taipei, Taiwan. This means we can support our customers close to where they need us. Such direct local support is highly valued by our customers and complements their development activities. In addition to global presence, effective development work in small teams is one of the most important benefits of our business model. The individual design centers frequently exchange know-how enabling them to focus on innovative design work and, using uniform design software and IT infrastructure, drive product developments forward at multiple locations simultaneously., 259481=We occasionally use a limited number of independent sales representatives in our coverage efforts. In 2005, we generated more than 90% of our revenues from sales directly to customers through our regional sales offices and less than 10% of our revenues from sales through representatives. Our marketing department is responsible for new market research and development, competition analysis and identifying new target applications. This ensures that we retain an application focus on the wireless communications and automotive sectors in addition to the customer focus of our sales team., 630983=(2)Previously filed as an exhibit to the Company's Annual Report on Form 20-F for 2000, filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on June 4, 2001 and incorporated herein by reference., 379506=Cash provided by operating activities was \u20ac10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with cash used for operating activities of \u20ac8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The cash inflow in 2005 primarily resulted from lower inventory balances. During the year ended December 31, 2004 we used cash to finance our growing working capital requirements, and inventory and accounts receivable were up as our business volume increased. In addition, in 2004 we increased inventory to meet previously projected forecasts of our customers., 630355=13.2Section 1350 Certification of Vice-President of Finance and Controlling of the Company in accordance with Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.(6), 378800=For the reasons described above, we reported a net loss of \u20ac23.3 million and \u20ac6.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 respectively. Loss per share (basic) was \u20ac0.53 in 2005 and \u20ac0.14 in 2004., 196354=On May 25, 2006, the noon buying rate was $1.28 per \u20ac1.00., 237900=We focus on the production and supply of mixed signal ASICs and ASSPs for the cellular communications market and, to a lesser but increasing extent, for the automotive electronics market. We also supply ASICs for other consumer and industrial applications in the lighting systems and data communications markets. Revenues from our wireless communications applications accounted for 80% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 78% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004. Revenues from our automotive and industrial applications sector were 20% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 22% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004., 529609=Clearstream Banking AG (\u201cClearstream\u201d) and a nominee of Clearstream holding two shares are the current holders of record of the company\u2019s shares. Clearstream issues bearer rights to these shares to financial institutions who are participants in Clearstream and through whom beneficial owners (including US beneficial owners) hold our shares. Due to the secrecy laws of some of the jurisdictions (including Germany) in which the participants of Clearstream are located, these participants may not be obligated to disclose information regarding beneficial ownership of our shares pursuant to Section 198 of the Companies Act 1985 or the Nasdaq Europe regulations. Consequently, we are unable to identify the US beneficial owners of these shares., 617152=As of the end of the period covered by this annual report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including Executive Officer Dr. Jalal Bagherli and Vice-President of Finance and Controlling Martin Kloeble, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that the material financial and non-financial information required to be disclosed in this Form 20-F is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management has considered the needs of the Company in light of its size and industry, and has recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Based upon that evaluation, our management, including Mr. Bagherli and Mr. Kloeble, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in the accumulation and timely communication of material information relating to the Company as required to be included in periodic SEC filings., 501067=The Company\u2019s Compensation Committee of the board of directors determines the salaries and incentive compensation of our CEO and senior management and provides recommendations for the salaries and incentive compensation of other employees and consultants. The Compensation Committee also administers our various compensation, stock and benefit plans. Our Compensation Committee consists of Messrs. Glover, Reyes and Risman. None of the members of this Committee was our employee at any time during 2005., 623253=The aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by KPMG for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning were \u20ac 60,562 for the year ended December 31, 2005, and \u20ac 109,923 for the year ended December 31, 2004. Tax fees are fees for professional services rendered by KPMG for tax compliance, tax advice on actual or contemplated transactions, and tax consulting associated with international transfer prices., 636842=May 18, 2006, 74572=(1)Includes provision for excess inventory of \u20ac6,576 and \u20ac740 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively., 259249=At December 31, 2005, we had a direct sales and marketing staff of 24, of which eleven are based in Germany, five in the United Kingdom, five in the United States two in Japan and one in Taiwan., 330701=We have a significant amount of liquid assets on hand, primarily from the remaining sales proceeds from the issuance of our ordinary shares in 1999 and 2000, from cash generated from operations in previous years and from recoveries of certain of our investments and deposits. Substantially all of our near term future cash inflows are expected to come from the sale of our products. We generally collect cash from our customers within 69 days after product delivery. However, we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a relatively small number of wireless communications manufacturers. Sales to three customers accounted for 64% of total revenues in 2005. Therefore, the main action we are taking to minimize the risk of this dependency is developing new products for new customers; such new products include a range of color liquid crystal display drivers and new intelligent motion control ICs in the automotive market. We anticipate material opportunities in the future to include growth in our main market, cellular handsets, based on the expected transition to 3G, and further worldwide growth in semiconductor sales, especially in Asia. However, our revenues, profitability and growth could decline if the growth in these markets slows. We believe that our key performance indicators driving our operating profit or loss are revenues, gross margin and research and development costs. Accordingly, our Board of Directors and management use operating profit as a measure of performance., 4659=Indicate by check mark whether the registrant (1) has filed all reports required to be filed by Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the proceeding 12 months (or for such shorter period that the registrant was required to file such reports), and (2) has been subject to such filing requirements for the past 90 days., 442059=The following table sets out the amount of remuneration paid by us and our subsidiaries to each of our directors for services rendered during the year ended December 31, 2005., 631287=(3)On October 25, 2001, the US Securities and Exchange Commission granted our request for confidential treatment of the commercially sensitive material in this contract., 1004859=In 2000, the Company paid $2.5 million as an advance payment to one of its suppliers. Those advance payments are classified in the balance sheet line items \"Prepaid expenses\". The outstanding balance is refunded in proportion to the Company\u2019s purchases of wafers from this supplier and, at this time, the Company expects to have the entire advance payments refunded. The amount of advance payments classified in prepaid expenses on the consolidated balance sheet as current assets represents that amount of advance payments expected to be refunded in the next twelve months., 384808=Current liabilities in 2005 were \u20ac4.6 million below the previous year\u2019s level. Non-current liabilities amounting to \u20ac2.9 million consisted exclusively of the financing equivalent related to software and licences purchased during the year. See note 11 to the consolidated financial statements., 593742=On May 25, 2006 the closing market quotation for our shares on Nasdaq was $2.07., 398385=For the year ended December 31, 2005, 69% of our revenues were denominated in US Dollars, 19% were denominated in Euro and 12% were denominated in Japanese Yen, and 84% of our cost of sales was denominated in US Dollars and 16% was denominated in Euro. For the year ended December 31, 2004, 55% of our revenues were denominated in Euro and 45% were denominated in US Dollars, and 18% of our cost of sales was denominated in Euro and 82% was denominated in US Dollars. We also have foreign currency risks with respect to our net investments in foreign subsidiaries in Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Foreign currency translation gains and losses with respect to these subsidiaries are included in other comprehensive income., 382356=Purchases of property, plant and equipment were \u20ac4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to \u20ac12.3\u00a0million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Our capital expenditures in 2005 and 2004 consisted primarily of purchasing new or replacement test systems, tooling equipment, handling systems and other equipment in the ordinary course of our business. Capital expenditures in 2004 were higher than in 2005 as in 2004 we upgraded eight test systems enabling us to test four ICs in a single test step, and added certain test equipment to test color display and image sensor ICs. Purchases of intangible assets were \u20ac8.8 million in 2005 and \u20ac0.3 million in 2004. In 2005 acquisitions primarily related to three year licensing contracts for the use of electronic design automated tools. See note 10 to the consolidated financial statements., 440136=MARTIN KLOEBLE joined us in July 1999 as Vice-President of Finance and Controlling. He holds an MBA from the University of Stuttgart-Hohenheim and is qualified as a tax consultant (STEUERBERATER) as well as a certified public accountant in Germany (WIRTSCHAFTSPRUEFER) and in the United States (CPA). Before joining Dialog, Mr. Kloeble worked with KPMG, and was appointed a partner at the beginning of 1999., 381130=At December 31, 2005 we had \u20ac16.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and \u20ac14.9 million in marketable securities. The working capital was \u20ac64.8 million., 369156=Revenues in the wireless communications sector were \u20ac103.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with \u20ac90.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, comprising 79.9% and 78.0% of our total revenues from continuing operations for those periods. The increase in this sector resulted from higher sales volumes of new products introduced in 2005, primarily color display driver ICs. Operating profit in this sector decreased from \u20ac5.2\u00a0million for the year ended December 31, 2004 to \u20ac4.5\u00a0million for the year ended December 31, 2005., 517544=On March 26, 1998, in connection with the acquisition of the Company, we and our then majority owner, Apax Partners, adopted a Subscription and Shareholders Agreement under which employees and directors were invited at the discretion of the Board, to purchase up to 3,456,890 ordinary shares of the Company from Apax Partners or an established Dialog Semiconductor Plc Employee Benefit Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d). The purchase price of the shares was equal to their estimated fair value on the date the employee or director subscribed for those shares. During the first quarter of 1999, the Trust acquired the remaining 668,800 ordinary shares from Apax Partners, which were not sold to employees or directors for purposes of distributing them to employees under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan or for distribution in connection with the exercise of employee stock options., 628615=4.1Supply Agreement with Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Pte., Ltd. dated June 30, 2000. (2)(3), 370466=Revenues were \u20ac129.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with \u20ac115.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase of 11.8% in revenues primarily resulted from higher sales volumes in the wireless communications sector as described above., 438893=BILL CAPARELLI Joined us in June 2005, as Vice President, Sales adding extensive experience of growing businesses within the semiconductor industry, having held senior sales and general management positions in major US companies., 622072=The aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by the principal accountant, KPMG, for the audit of our financial statements or services normally provided by the auditor in connection with statutory and regulatory filings were \u20ac191,624 for the year ended December 31, 2005, and \u20ac173,857 for the year ended December 31, 2004., 439160=GARY DUNCAN joined us in October 1987 and is currently the Vice-President of Engineering. He obtained a Higher National Certificate in electronics and mathematics in 1978 from Plymouth Polytechnic and is a chartered engineer. Before joining Dialog, Mr. Duncan held various senior engineering and management positions at Plessey and ES2 in quality and production, device engineering, design software and marketing., 625950=We rely on an exemption from the listing standard for audit committees as set forth under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(d)(2). This exemption was granted to Dialog on August 1, 2000. We do not believe that our reliance on this exemption would materially adversely affect the ability of our audit committee to act independently and to satisfy other requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In lieu of following this requirement on audit committee composition, Dialog\u2019s audit committee consists of two independent members in accordance with law, rule, regulation, and generally accepted business practices in Dialog\u2019s home country of England and Wales., 851609=The board of directors authorized the consolidated financial statements for issue on May 18, 2006., 390798=In 2005, 3G cellular systems became firmly established, taking a substantial share of the replacement market in Europe, with one of the key drivers for growth being the introduction by manufacturers of new 3G phone models in form factors comparable to their 2.5G counterparts. Dialog Semiconductor\u2019s solutions address the WCDMA sector of 3G, and worldwide WCDMA shipments grew over 140% in 2005 to 46.4 million (Gartner Forecast: \u201cMobile Phone Production and Semiconductor Market, Worldwide, 2003-2010, 1Q06 Update\u201d, March 7, 2006). As network operators increase promotional activity to boost the market and new applications such as mobile TV spur further demand, this rapid growth trend is expected to continue for the next two years., 618473=In April 2006, we decided to focus on more value-added, differentiated display driver chips and not to compete further within the lower margin commodity end of the display driver chip market. Following this decision, our management and the audit committee of the board of directors learned about certain facts and circumstances that existed at year end and determined that certain inventories and trade accounts receivable were overstated and tooling included in property, plant and equipment was impaired as of December 31, 2005. We then identified additional facts that existed at the balance sheet date related to the settlement arrangements with former senior executives and adjusted accrued expenses accordingly., 250327=Our engineering group consists of over 100 professionals (as of December 31, 2005) with mixed signal ASIC experience. We use design tools from Cadence Design Systems, Inc. to increase design automation and top level simulation to identify system design incompatibilities at an early stage. Furthermore, we base our production around a standard CMOS semiconductor technology process in order to focus the design efforts more effectively. See \u201cManufacture of wafers\u201d below. Aside from our primary focus on ASICs, we believe that we can adapt some of our solutions to more than one customer and offer ASSPs. By engaging in basic corporate identity and brand development activities in the engineering and design community worldwide, in prior years we laid the foundations for marketing ASSPs to a broader customer base than we have previously had., 894630=Losses from the Imaging Division in 2005 and 2004 are comprised of:, 891658=In August 2005, the IASB issued a complementary amendment to IAS 1 \u201cPresentation of Financial Statements - Capital Disclosures\u201d. The amendment to IAS 1 adds requirements for all entities to disclose the entity\u2019s objectives, policies and processes for managing capital and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2007. Earlier application is encouraged. As a result of the first time adoption of this amendment to IAS 1 the Company expects additional disclosure requirements within the notes to its consolidated financial statements., 503683=As of December 31, 2005, our directors and senior management held 1,548,535 shares., 849671=Although Dialog Semiconductor Plc is a UK company, its principal operations are located in Germany and all of its operating subsidiaries are held by the German subsidiary. Accordingly, the financial statements are presented in thousands of Euro (\u201c\u20ac\u201d) and for the year 2005 are also presented in U.S. Dollars (\u201c$\u201d), the latter being unaudited and presented solely for convenience of the reader at the rate of \u20ac1 = $1.1842, the Noon Buying Rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on December 30, 2005., 850418=IFRS 1, First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, requires disclosures that explain how the transition from previous GAAP to IFRS affected the entity\u2019s reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows and to comply with each IFRS effective at the reporting date for its first IFRS financial statements. An entity shall prepare an opening IFRS balance sheet at the date of transition and present at least one year of comparative information under IFRS. Accordingly the Company\u2019s date of transition to IFRS is the beginning of business on January 1, 2004 (opening IFRS balance sheet date). As a UK company, Dialog has to use its financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom (\"UK GAAP\"), which are filed at Companies House for purposes of conversion from previous GAAP to IFRS., 633938=Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, 599234=A US holder who is an individual and who has on or after March 17, 1998 ceased to be resident or ordinarily resident for tax purposes in the UK for a period of less than five years of assessment and who disposes of shares or ADSs during that period may be liable on his or her return to the UK to UK tax on chargeable gains, subject to any available exemption or relief, notwithstanding that he or she is not resident or ordinarily resident in the UK at the time of the disposal., 405599=Our business is capital intensive and has required, and will continue to require, significant investments in long-lived assets, including property, plant, equipment and intangible assets. At December 31, 2005, the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment was \u20ac16.2 million. As discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, recoverability of these long-lived assets that will continue to be held and used is evaluated whenever an indication of impairment exists. Then we will compare the carrying value of the asset or group of assets with the asset\u2019s or cash generating unit\u2019s fair value less cost to sell and its value in use. If either of these amounts exceeds the asset\u2019s or cash generating unit\u2019s carrying amount, the asset or cash generating unit is not impaired. If the asset or cash generating unit is considered impaired, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the impaired asset or cash generating unit exceeds its fair value less cost to sell and its value in use., 620678=Our board has determined that we have at least one audit committee financial expert, as defined in Form 20-F of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act, 1934, serving on our audit committee. This expert is Mr. Hughes, who is independent as such term is defined in the listing standards applicable to us., 413306=The following table sets forth, as of March 30, 2006, the name of each member of our board of directors and each of our senior management, their ages, the dates of their first appointments and their positions:, 892254=In August 2005, the IASB issued IFRS 7 \u201cFinancial Instruments: Disclosures\u201d. IFRS 7 introduces new requirements to improve the information on financial instruments that is given in entities\u2019 financial statements and changes or amends certain disclosure requirements. It replaces IAS 30 \u201cDisclosures in the Financial Statements of Banks and Similar Financial Institutions\u201d and some of the requirements in IAS 32 \u201cFinancial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation\u201d. IFRS 7 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2007. Earlier application is encouraged. As a result of the first time adoption of IFRS 7 the Company expects additional disclosure requirements within the notes to its consolidated financial statements, 371395=Cost of sales consists of the costs of outsourcing production and assembly, related personnel costs and applicable overhead and depreciation of test and other equipment. Cost of sales increased by 16.7% from \u20ac79.3 million (68.5% of our total revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004 to \u20ac92.5 million (71.5% of our total revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005, in line with increased production volumes. Also, cost of sales in 2005 includes a provision for excess inventory of \u20ac6.6 million compared to a provision for excess inventory of \u20ac0.7 for the year ending December 31, 2004., 518765=At December 31, 2005, the Trust continued to hold 1,691,155 shares, equaling the remaining balance of the acquired 668,800 shares and the 2,000,000 shares acquired in 2004., 502918=At December 31, 2005, we employed 279 full-time employees not including trainees/apprentices, of which 189 were based in Germany, 52 in the United Kingdom, 24 in the United States, 6 in Austria, 7 in Japan and 1 in Taiwan. Of the total number, 146 were engaged in engineering (including design and product engineering) and 79 were engaged in production (including logistics, quality and testing). The average number of employees in 2005 was 280 compared to 281 in 2004 and 273 in 2003., 381321=As of December 31, 2005 we had no long-term debt other than deferred payments for acquired software licenses. A decrease in customer demand for our products caused by unfavorable industry conditions or an inability to develop new products in response to technological changes could materially reduce the amount of cash generated from operations., 434518=MICHAEL JOHN GLOVER joined the board of our then-holding company in 1990 and has served as one of our directors since March 1998. Mr. Glover was a senior executive with technology based companies in the United Kingdom, Europe, the Far East and North America prior to becoming involved in private equity fund management in 1985. He has a degree in economics from the University of Birmingham. Mr. Glover currently is Managing Director of Aylestone Strategic Management Limited and serves as a director of other companies., 435481=JOHN MCMONIGALL has served as one of our directors since March 1998. He joined Apax Partners as a director in 1990 and is currently the director responsible for investments in telecommunications, software and related fields. Between 1986 and 1990, Mr. McMonigall held a variety of senior positions at British Telecom, including managing director of the customer service division. He was also a member of the management board of British Telecom. He is currently on the board of five other public and private companies, including Crane Telecommunications Ltd, Autonomy Corporation plc and Amphion Ltd., 409247=Total deferred tax assets (including those that were not recognized) were \u20ac34.2 million at December 31, 2005, which include deferred tax assets of \u20ac28.3 million on tax loss carryforwards. While the majority of these losses may be carried forward indefinitely, their realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income to utilize the losses., 373062=General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and support costs for our finance, human resources, information systems and other management departments. General and administrative expenses increased from \u20ac5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 to \u20ac6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to settlement arrangements with senior executives. As a result general and administrative expenses increased from 4.8% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 to 4.9% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005., 439611=PETER HALL joined us in July 1987 and is currently our Vice-President of Operations and Quality. Before joining Dialog he held various management and engineering positions at STC Semiconductors and MEM in Switzerland. Mr. Hall obtained his BSc (Honors) in electrical and electronic engineering in 1974 from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, his MSc in digital techniques in 1977 from the University of Edinburgh and his MBA in technology management in 2003 from the Open University., 394877=Due to the\u00a0cell phone customers phase out of\u00a0\u00a0Dialog \u00a02G\u00a0chips and\u00a0partial adoption of\u00a0\u00a0competing intermediate\u00a0solutions prior to adoption of \u00a0Dialog's \u00a03G\u00a0\u00a0ICs, \u00a0and increased competitive pressures for display driver chips we expect revenues for the year ending December 31, 2006 to be lower than those for the year ended December 31, 2005. Our forward visibility with respect to customer demand is limited and a successful introduction of new products depends on the completion of new designs on a timely basis. Our revenues for 2006 will also be highly dependent on continued growth in the worldwide market for cellular handsets., 199116=We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a relatively small number of wireless communications manufacturers that require high performance, low cost semiconductor products. Sales to three customers accounted for 64% of total revenues in 2005. Sales to two customers accounted for 65% and 61% of total revenues in 2004 and 2002, respectively. Sales to one customer individually accounted for 65% of total revenues in 2003. Our revenues declined for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, primarily as a result of significantly reduced revenue from one major customer. Although revenues increased in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, the further loss of revenue from one or more major customers would result in a material decrease in our revenues in future periods. In addition, because we depend on a relatively small, focused customer base, we are exposed to downward pricing pressures from those customers., 389856=Total cellular handset shipments exceeded 816 million in 2005, representing a significant 14% growth over 2004 (source: iSuppli weekly newsletter, SuppliNEWS, February 1, 2006). A significant trend in this growth during 2005 has been the consolidation of market position among the top five handset manufacturers, which through economies of scale and global reach have squeezed out second tier players \u2013 manufacturers outside the top five lost 18% of their previous market share. This trend is likely to continue as the leading players will be best positioned to capture the ultra low cost and the high performance 3G market spaces., 1005749=A summary of activity for property, plant and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 is as follows:, 980029=In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods, in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, benefits that could be realized from available tax planning strategies and other positive and negative factors in making this assessment. Considering the weight given to cumulative losses incurred in Germany over the five-year period ended December\u00a031, 2005, as well as the inherent uncertainties in projecting future taxable income, pursuant to IAS 12, management concluded that tax losses may not ultimately be realized. Consequently, the Company recognized an additional valuation allowance of \u20ac18,390 as of December\u00a031, 2005., 594665=Incorporated by reference to our Registration Statement on Form F-1, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 27, 2000., 604963=During a twelve-month transition period under the new UK-US income tax treaty (which ends on 30 April 2004), an eligible US shareholder that elects the benefits of the old UK-US treaty may be entitled to a foreign tax credit for UK withholding tax in an amount equal to the tax credit payment that the US shareholder is entitled to receive from the UK Inland Revenue under the old treaty. At current rates, a dividend of \u20a490 entitles an eligible US shareholder claiming benefits under the old treaty to a payment of \u20a410 offset by a UK withholding tax of \u20a410. Because the tax credit payment and the withholding tax offset each other, the Inland Revenue neither makes the payment nor collects the tax. The offsetting payments nevertheless have tax significance because an electing US shareholder must include the tax credit payment in its income and may claim a foreign tax credit for the UK withholding tax (subject to otherwise applicable limitations on foreign tax credits). To make the election, a US shareholder (or where the US shareholder is a partnership, each eligible US partner) must file a completed US Internal Revenue Service Form 8833 with its US federal income tax return for the relevant year. US shareholders cannot claim UK tax credit payments under the new UK-US treaty after the transition period. You should consult your own tax advisors about the consequences of the new treaty in light of your particular circumstances., 498285=(1)As a result of Roland Pudelko leaving the board on February 14, 2006, it has been agreed that his share options will lapse on December 31, 2006., 399441=We have no off-balance sheet arrangements involving variable interest entities. We lease all of our office facilities, office and test equipment, and vehicles under operating leases. In addition we have contracted consulting services related to CAD (computer aided designs) until June 30, 2009. Future minimum payments under these agreements, which have initial or remaining terms in excess of one year at December 31, 2005, are as follows., 528911=Adtran, through its wholly-owned subsidiary ADFI, Inc., owns 2,520,960 ordinary shares or 5.5%. Prior to the secondary offering in June 2000, Adtran owned 5,305,810 ordinary shares or 12.6%. Adtran\u2019s voting rights do not differ from the rights of other shareholders., 172260=On May 25, 2006, the noon buying rate was $1.87 per \u00a31.00., 200270=We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the wireless communications market, which experienced difficult conditions in 2001, 2002 and the first half of 2003. Our revenues from wireless communications applications accounted for 80%, 78% and 75% in the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Our revenues increased 12% from \u20ac115.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 to \u20ac129.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 25% from \u20ac92.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to \u20ac115.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to new products introduced to volume production with more functionality and accordingly, higher selling prices. Worldwide sales of cellular handsets increased in the second half of 2003 and 2004 (particularly in Asia), but we can give no assurance that this trend will continue. In future periods, conditions in the wireless communications market may fluctuate, which could result in either growth or decline. Conditions in the wireless communications market may be influenced by numerous factors, including:, 251209=We believe we offer our clients a significant advantage through our ability to rapidly develop mixed signal ASIC and ASSP designs. This ability has been fostered through many years of design experience and a highly skilled engineering staff. We keep track of evolving design elements through our design library database. We achieve rapid design cycles through our strategy of modifying and reusing previously designed building blocks. We use the CR16B, a 16 bit microprocessor core which we acquired under a license of indefinite duration in 2000. This core, which utilizes the CompactRISC\u2122 architecture developed by National Semiconductor for embedded applications that are integrated with other functions on a single integrated circuit, provides a high performance, general purpose, flexible and power efficient platform that can be used in a wide variety of designs. This technology enables us to develop system-on-chip (\u201cSOC\u201d) designs combining analog, digital and microcontroller functions. We have successfully integrated circuits combining complex digital functions including eFlash, which can simultaneously handle 40V in a 0.35-\u00b5 technology., 440581=RICHARD SCHMITZ joined us in 1994 and is currently our Vice-President of Advanced Technology. Prior to joining us, he held various design-related positions at Hewlett Packard's instruments division in Boeblingen and the Institute for Microelectronics, Stuttgart. Mr. Schmitz received a diploma in engineering for communications electronics in 1983 from the vocational college (FACHHOCHSCHULE) in Trier., 619229=We revised our previously released primary financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2005 to reflect a write-down of certain inventories, trade accounts receivable, tooling, accrued expenses and of the carrying value of the deferred tax asset.\u00a0 Such revised primary financial statements have been issued on May 18, 2006 and are included in this Annual Report on Form 20-F., 633840=Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, 234706=We recognize that one of our key strengths lies in the engineering expertise of our employees in design, product development and testing. Due to the increasing complexity of mixed signal design and production, it is essential to our ongoing success that we attract, develop and retain key engineering personnel. We intend to continue to meet this challenge by offering our technical staff a variety of ongoing educational and career opportunities, combined with performance incentives and by actively recruiting additional highly skilled individuals. See \u201c\u2013Sales and Marketing\u201d below. One example is the announcement of the availability of a brand new range of color liquid crystal display (LCD) drivers providing real innovation for the mobile phone display market in 2004.

Apax Partners act as Manager of Apax Funds Nominees Limited and Managing General Partner of Apax Germany II L.P., respectively. Apax Funds Nominees Limited holds shares as a nominee for certain other Apax Venture Capital Limited Partnerships. Prior to the secondary offering in June 2000, Apax Partners owned 18,091,170 of our ordinary shares or 41.2%. Apax Partners\u2019 voting rights do not differ from the rights of other shareholders., 375320=Interest and similar income, net from the Company\u2019s investments (primarily short-term deposits and securities) was \u20ac0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and \u20ac1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, reflecting mainly higher cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during 2004., 404591=We did not pay dividends in the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. We do not currently plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future., 435076=AIDAN HUGHES joined us as a director in October 2004.

Foreign currency exchange gains, net were \u20ac1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with foreign currency exchange losses, net of \u20ac0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The loss in 2004 was primarily due to the reduction in value of the US Dollar against the Euro over the period. The gain in 2005 was primarily due to the increase in value of the US Dollar against the Euro over the period., 847728=The Company depends on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of its revenues, and the loss of one or more of these customers may result in a significant decline in future revenue. During 2005 three customers within our wireless segment individually accounted for more than 10% of the Company's revenues. Total revenues from these three customers were \u20ac82,996 or 64%. Net receivables from these three customers were \u20ac23,908 at December 31, 2005.

This increase in operating profit was primarily due to the increase in revenues, offset by higher inventory write-downs., 389380=The year has been one of fast-paced change in the consumer and in-car electronics industry. In 2004, we had expected convergence and 3G to play a key part in the growth outlook for 2005 \u2013 and indeed it has proved to be fairly accurate. The key headline trends that are particularly relevant to Dialog Semiconductor\u2019s business are indicated in the following section., 437=AS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ON JUNE 29, 2006, 392932=The demand for in-car electronics continued to be strong during 2005, especially as more and more vehicles provide as part of the standard accessories or options package many of the features once found in only top-of-the-range cars. In particular, Dialog Semiconductor\u2019s motion control ICs enable intelligent motor controllers found all over the car \u2013 such as in windscreen wipers, seat controls and window controls., 629683=12.1Rule 13a-14(a) Certification of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company in accordance with Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002., 468728=(1)Tim Anderson is also a partner in the law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain, which frequently acts as our legal adviser.

Tim Anderson resigned as non-executive Director on February 1, 2006., 408332=At December 31, 2005, our total inventory was \u20ac17.2 million. In 2005 and 2004, we recorded provisions for excess inventory of \u20ac6.6 million and \u20ac0.7 million, respectively. We believe that the carrying value of our inventory will be recovered through customer consumption of goods based on their forecasts and related contractual agreements. However, the demand for our products can fluctuate significantly in response to rapid technological changes in the semiconductor and wireless communications industries. It is reasonably possible that future operating results could be materially and adversely affected if any excess inventory charges are needed., 601728=On 23 February 2000, the Inland Revenue indicated that the US and UK Governments had scheduled negotiations for revisions to their estate and gift tax treaty. However, as of the date of this annual report no such negotiations have taken place., 378160=The losses from discontinued operations were \u20ac12.5 million and \u20ac8.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The Commission also maintains a web site at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy statements and other information regarding registrants that file electronically with the Commission. Our annual reports and some other information submitted by us to the Commission may be accessed through this web site., 893982=As of December 31, 2005 Dialog recorded a write-down of the carrying value of assets to be contributed to DIS in 2006 of \u20ac3.9 million. The write-down was required because the consideration received in exchange for the assets contributed is a preferential right to receive proceeds following a future sale of DIS. However, such a contingent gain will only be recorded when realized. The Company expects further losses from discontinued operations in 2006 of \u20ac1.8 million comprised of operating losses incurred before control was legally transferred on February 14, 2006 inclusive of transaction and legal costs., 981079=The tax loss carryforwards in the US will expire between 2006 and 2019; other tax loss carryforwards have no expiration date., 409639=We have evaluated our deferred tax asset position and considered whether it is probable that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The assessment requires the exercise of judgment on the part of our management, with respect to, among other things, benefits that could be realized from available tax strategies and future taxable income, as well as other positive and negative factors. Our assessment considered the weight given to cumulative tax losses incurred in the group, as well as detailed forecasts of taxable income in the foreseeable future. Although we forecasted future taxable income, pursuant to the inherent uncertainties in projecting future taxable income, we concluded that our tax losses may not ultimately be realized. Consequently, we recognized an additional valuation allowance as of December\u00a031, 2005., 381705=If necessary, we have available for use short-term credit facilities of \u20ac12.5 million that bear interest at a rate of EURIBOR + 0.75% per annum. At December 31, 2005 we had no amounts outstanding under these facilities. Accordingly, we believe the funding available from these and other sources will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements in the near to medium term., 890695=In the fourth quarter of 2004, the company determined that the useful life of its test equipment is eight years. Previously the useful life had been determined to be five years. Management determined that the estimated useful life of the equipment after investing in certain upgrades which enable the systems to test new and more complex power management integrated circuits and postponing replacement investments exceeded the initial estimate of five years and therefore extended the useful life of the systems. The effect of this change in accounting estimates resulted in a lower depreciation of \u20ac1,349 and in a lower net loss of \u20ac842 or \u20ac0.02 per share during the year ended December 31, 2004., 593574=(1)Our shares were first listed on Nasdaq on June 29, 2000., 846698=The Company's products are generally utilized in the cellular communications and automotive industries. The Company generates a substantial portion of its revenue from the wireless communications market, which accounted for 80% and 78% of the Company\u2019s total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively., 380101=Cash used for investing activities was \u20ac7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with cash provided by investing activities of \u20ac14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Cash used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted mostly of the purchase of test equipment, tooling (masks), laboratory equipment, probecards and loadboards of \u20ac4.0 million and the purchase of software and licenses of \u20ac5.5 million. Cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 consisted mostly of a net sale of marketable securities of \u20ac27.4 million offset in part by the purchase of test equipment, tooling (masks), laboratory and EDP equipment of \u20ac12.3 million, and the purchase of software, licenses and patents of \u20ac0.7 million., 470530=As of December 31, 2005, our directors and senior management held 1,776,400 options for our ordinary shares which entitle the holders to acquire 1,776,400 shares. The following table gives stock option information for the Company\u2019s directors and senior management., 383630=Balance sheet total as of December 31, 2005 and as of December 31, 2004 amounted to \u20ac103.1million and \u20ac127.1 million, respectively. Current assets decreased from \u20ac86.2 million as of December 31, 2004 to \u20ac79.1 million as of December 31, 2005. In line with growing sales volumes in the course of the year inventories were sold off and certain write-downs were recorded, leading to a decline of \u20ac12.6 million as against the end of last year and accounts receivable increased by \u20ac4.3 million. Long-term assets decreased from \u20ac40.9 million, or 32.2% of the balance sheet total, as of December 31, 2004 to \u20ac24.0 million, or 23.3% of the balance sheet total, as of December 31, 2005, mainly caused by the increase of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of \u20ac15.3 million, the depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of \u20ac10.0 million and a write-down of the carrying value of assets to be contributed to Dialog Imaging Systems in 2006 of \u20ac3.9 million. See note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. This was partially offset by capital expenditures and investments in 2005 of \u20ac12.8 million., 634060=Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, 630683=(1)Previously filed as an exhibit to the Company\u2019s Registration Statement on Form F-1, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 27, 2000 and incorporated herein by reference., 436118=GREGORIO REYES joined us as a director in December 2003, and has been a private investor and management consultant since 1994 with current board positions at companies including LSI Logic Corp., Appshop, Amphion Semiconductor, Astute Networks, Future Trade Technologies, and Nuera Communications. He has held various executive positions with National Semiconductor (1962-1967), Motorola (1967-1968) and Fairchild Semiconductor (1968-1978). He was also president and CEO of National Micronetics (1981-1984), and Chairman and CEO of American Semiconductor Equipment Technologies (1986-1990), and of Sunward Technologies (1990-1994)., 992552=The recorded trade accounts receivable for which an impairment has been recognized was \u20ac15 and \u20ac34 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The related allowance for doubtful accounts was \u20ac8 and \u20ac17 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively., 4323=If this report is an annual or transition report, indicate by check mark if the registrant is not required to file reports pursuant to Section\u00a013 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934., 385654=Research and development expenditure amounted to \u20ac20.6 million in 2005 and \u20ac22.4 million in 2004. We expect research and development costs to increase in 2006 as we are planning to add to our headcount in order to strengthen our core competence. Our ability to generate revenues in the long term depends on achieving technical feasibility from our research and development programs, and on customers accepting our designs and implementing them in large-scale production., 885553=Earnings (loss) per share has been computed using the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares for each year. Because the Company reported a net loss in each of the two periods presented, only basic per share amounts have been presented for those periods. Had the Company reported net income in 2005 and 2004, the weighted average number of shares outstanding would have potentially been as follows:, 624444=Our Audit Committee nominates and engages our independent auditors to audit our financial statements. In 2003 our Audit Committee also adopted a policy requiring management to obtain the Committee\u2019s approval before engaging our independent auditors to provide any other audit or permitted non-audit services to us or our subsidiaries. Pursuant to this policy, which is designed to assure that such engagements do not impair the independence of our auditors, the Audit Committee pre-approves annually a catalog of specific Tax Consulting Services that may be performed by our auditors. 100% of the tax services referred to under \u201cTax Fees\u201d above were pre-approved by the Audit Committee in 2005 and 2004, respectively., 884487=The Company has established a share option scheme under which employees and executive directors may be granted stock options to acquire shares of the company. The fair value of options granted is recognized as a compensation expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the service period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. Expectations of early exercise are accounted for within the average life of the options. The Company applies IFRS 2 to all options granted after November 7, 2002 that had not yet vested as of January 1, 2005., 622657=There were no assurance or related services performed by KPMG which were reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and not reported under \u201c\u2014Audit Fees\u201d above, for the year ended December 31, 2005 or for the year ended December 31, 2004. As such, aggregate fees billed for such services in these years were nil., 406684=We do not believe that our ability to recover the carrying value of our long-lived assets has been impaired. As of December 31, 2005 we recorded a write-down of the carrying value of assets to be contributed to the sale of our Imaging Division in 2006 of \u20ac3.9 million. See note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. A general economic downturn and, specifically, a continued downturn in the semiconductor industry would intensify competitive pricing pressure because of overcapacity in the industry, and we could be forced to decrease production and reduce capacity. Such events could adversely affect our estimates of future net cash flows expected to be generated by our long-lived assets. It is reasonably possible that our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected by an impairment charge related to the recoverability of our long-lived assets., 242349=In 2005 we launched a further range of color liquid crystal display (LCD) drivers providing real innovation for the mobile phone display market. Delivered as standard parts ready for production, the DA89xx family delivers superior color performance and low power consumption, while providing mobile phone handset makers the flexibility to customize display parameters for creating differentiation., 397459=Since its introduction on January 1, 1999, the Euro has fluctuated in value against the US Dollar. From the date of its introduction through to December 31, 2001, the Euro declined approximately 25% against the US Dollar. By March 14, 2006 the Euro had recovered to 102% of its original value. Changes in the exchange rate between the Euro and other non-Euro currencies, principally the US Dollar, will affect the translation of our consolidated financial results into Euro, and will also affect the value of any amounts that our subsidiaries distribute to us. Exchange rate changes may also affect our balance sheet. Changes in the Euro values of our assets and liabilities resulting from exchange rate movements may cause us to record foreign currency gains and losses. We do not currently enter into forward or other derivative transactions to hedge against exchange rate fluctuations., 370774=Regional growth was particularly strong in Asia where revenues increased from \u20ac42.1 million (\u20ac19.7\u00a0million in China, \u20ac4.8 million in Japan and \u20ac17.5\u00a0million in other Asian countries) to \u20ac74.0\u00a0million (\u20ac21.6\u00a0million in China, \u20ac18.9 million in Japan and \u20ac33.5\u00a0million in other Asian countries) for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively., 369795=Revenues from our automotive / industrial applications sector were \u20ac26.0\u00a0million and \u20ac25.4\u00a0million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, representing 20.1% and 22.0% of our total revenues from continuing operations for those periods. Operating profit in the sector was \u20ac1.0 million in 2005, compared to an operating loss of \u20ac1.2 million in the previous year., 376839=Income tax expense was \u20ac15.3 million and \u20ac64 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The change in income taxes mainly reflects an additional valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of \u20ac15.3 million primarily related to the uncertainty about the future realizability of our German tax-loss carryforwards. We have evaluated our deferred tax asset position and the need for a valuation allowance as a result of further losses incurred in 2005 and a lack of visibility of profitability in 2006. Our assessment considered the weight given to cumulative tax losses incurred in Germany over the five-year period ended December\u00a031, 2005, as well as detailed forecasts of taxable income in the foreseeable future. Although we forecast generating future taxable income beginning 2007, pursuant to IAS 12 and the inherent uncertainties in projecting future taxable income, we concluded that our tax losses may not ultimately be realized. Consequently, we recognized an additional valuation allowance as of December\u00a031, 2005., 254470=We have adopted a strategy of outsourcing our wafer production to selected foundries with a demonstrated ability to provide high quality products on tight deadlines. The principal foundries we currently use are Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Pte., Ltd. in Singapore (\u201cChartered\u201d), X-FAB UK Ltd. (\u201cX-FAB\u201d), Taiwan Semiconductors Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (\u201cTSMC\u201d) and CSMC Manufacturing Co. Ltd in China (\u201cCSMC\u201d). In 2005, we outsourced our wafer production as follows: approximately 59% with Chartered, 28% with TSMC, 8% with CSMC and 5% with X-FAB., 240174=Our power management functions include Smart Mirror\u2122 LDO (low dropout voltage) regulators, high efficiency buck and boost converters, programmable multiple chemistry battery chargers for all common battery technologies like NiMH, L ion and polymer. Our patented Smart Mirror\u2122 technique, which we introduced in 2003, allows product designers to minimize current consumption and simplify their designs by eliminating \u2018power-down\u2019 modes. This was first introduced in our DA9010 integrated GSM/GPRS audio and power controller. Developed in collaboration with Intel Corporation, the DA9010 provides all the necessary power management and high performance audio functions for the phone handset chip design, offering a level of integration not previously available in this class of device. During 2005 we continued to develop new power management products such as the DA9025, DA9027 and DA9035 as well as the lightshow processor DA9026., 984=ANNUAL REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 For the fiscal year ended DECEMBER 31, 2005, 502110=We rely on an exemption from the quorum requirement as set forth under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(f). This exemption was granted to Dialog on 1 August 2000. In lieu of following this quorum requirement, Dialog\u2019s articles of association provides for quorum for any general meeting that is no less than two persons present in person or by proxy entitled to vote on the business to be transacted, which is in accordance with law, rule, regulation, and generally accepted business practices in Dialog\u2019s home country of England and Wales., 623916=There were no products or services provided by KPMG, other than those reported above under \u201c\u2014Audit Fees\u201d and \u201c\u2014Tax Fees,\u201d for the year ended December 31, 2005, or for the year ended December 31, 2004. As such, aggregate fees billed for such services in these years were nil., 395828=Our gross margin decreased from 31.5% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 to 28.5% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily resulting from a higher provision for excess inventory. We expect the near term future gross margin percentage to fall below the gross margin percentage achieved in 2005 as a result of lower utilization of our internal test operations and lower margins of certain display driver products., 530641=Timothy Anderson, a member of the Board until February 1, 2006, is also a partner in the law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain, which frequently acts as our legal adviser. Fees to Reynolds Porter Chamberlain for legal services rendered during the three year period ended December 31, 2005, December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 amounted to \u20ac286,823, \u20ac211,684 and \u20ac162,241, respectively., 220593=Dialog Semiconductor Plc (\u201cDialog\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a public limited company constituted under the laws of England and Wales. Our business originated from the European activities of International Microelectric Products, Inc., a US company active in the semiconductor industry. On May 20, 1985, International Microelectric Products, Inc. incorporated IMP (Europe) Limited as a private limited company registered in England and Wales. At the end of 1989 and the beginning of 1990, Daimler-Benz AG, now DaimlerChrysler AG, acquired IMP (Europe) Limited, which became part of a Daimler-Benz AG subsidiary, Temic Telefunken microelectronic GmbH, now Conti Temic microelectronic GmbH (\u201cConti Temic\u201d). In March 1998, three of our major shareholders, Apax Partners & Co. Ventures Ltd. and Apax Partners & Co, Germany II L.P. (together \u201cApax Partners\u201d), Adtran, Inc. (\u201cAdtran\u201d) and Ericsson provided funding to finance our buyout of the business from Daimler-Benz AG (now DaimlerChrysler AG). These shareholders contributed approximately \u20ac28.0 million in cash in exchange for ordinary shares in the amount of \u20ac5.3 million, additional paid-in capital in the amount of \u20ac5.3 million and cumulative redeemable preference shares in the amount of \u20ac17.5 million. We then acquired our predecessor business for \u20ac28.0 million. In connection with this acquisition, Apax Partners transferred some of its shares to members of management and the board of directors of our company and transferred additional shares then owned by it into the Dialog Semiconductor Plc Employee Benefit Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d) (a Jersey trust established to purchase our shares from and sell our shares to our employees and directors)., 525149=Where the option holder leaves our employment in circumstances of injury, disability, redundancy within the meaning of the UK Employment Rights Act 1996, the company for which the option holder works ceases to be a member of the Dialog Semiconductor group or the business for which the option holder works is transferred out of the Dialog Semiconductor group, options will be exercisable in the period of six months (three months in respect of incentive stock options) following termination of employment, whether or not any performance conditions which apply to them have been satisfied. In the event of a takeover, reconstruction or amalgamation of our company, options may be exercised in the period of six months following such event. Alternatively, options may be exchanged for options over shares in an acquiring company provided that the new option confers a right to acquire a number of new shares that have the same total market value as the subsisting option, the total amount payable by a participant is the same under the new option as under the subsisting option, and the new option is exercisable in the same manner as the corresponding subsisting option. In practice the six month period can be shortened by the compulsory acquisition procedure under Section 429 of the Companies Act 1985 on a takeover. In the event of a voluntary winding up of the company the options may be exercised within three months of the passing of a winding up resolution., 37068=Our audited consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 and for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\u201cUS GAAP\u201d) as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 and for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. Significant differences between IFRS and accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. GAAP that affect shareholders\u2019 equity as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 and our net loss for each of the years 2005 and 2004 are disclosed in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS which are included elsewhere in this annual report., 631565=(4)Previously filed as an exhibit to the Company's Annual Report on Form 20-F for 2002, filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2003 and incorporated herein by reference., 893288=On February 14, 2006 the Company concluded a disposition of its Imaging Division, Dialog Imaging Systems (\u201cDIS\u201d). The business of this division includes the development, design, manufacture, assembly, marketing and delivering of image sensor semiconductors and camera modules. Dialog transferred the assets of its Imaging Division to a newly created entity which will issue additional equity interests in exchange for consideration from investors. A total of \u20ac22.25\u00a0million will be invested in DIS by private equity investors, the management team and Dialog of which Dialog will invest \u20ac2 million due in two tranches of \u20ac1.2 million and \u20ac0.8 million., 391647=Personal media players and personal navigation devices are just two examples of products that have seen significant growth in 2005., 385138=Shareholders\u2019 equity decreased from \u20ac108.2 million at December 31, 2004 to \u20ac85.9 million at December 31, 2005 due to the net loss in 2005. The very solid equity ratio decreased slightly to 83.3% from 85.1%., 629902=12.2Rule 13a-14(a) Certification of the Vice-President of Finance and Controlling of the Company in accordance with Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002., 373905=Research and development expenses consist principally of design and engineering related costs associated with the development of new application specific integrated circuits (\u201cASICs\u201d) and application specific standard products (\u201cASSPs\u201d). Research and development expenses decreased from \u20ac22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 to \u20ac20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of certain cost saving measures. As a percentage of total revenues research and development expenses decreased from 19.3% to 15.9% in those periods, resulting from the absolute decrease and a higher revenue base in the latter period., 437527=JAN OLOF INGEMAR TUFVESSON joined the board of our then-holding company in 1990 and has served as chairman of the board since March 1998. Between 1972 and 1980 he held senior positions on the Royal Swedish Air Force Board. In 1980 he joined Ericsson where he had a number of executive roles, the last being a vice president at LM Ericsson corporate, responsible for all procurement in Ericsson and for developing relations with key suppliers. Mr. Tufvesson graduated from the Royal University of Technology in Stockholm with a masters degree in electronic engineering in 1962. Mr. Tufvesson retired from Ericsson in 1998 and is now based in Stockholm., 634817=We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dialog Semiconductor Plc and subsidiaries (\u201cthe Company\u201d) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and changes in shareholders\u2019 equity for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2005. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits., 469314=The aggregate compensation for our CEO and senior management for 2005 was \u20ac2,425,118., 848873=In compliance with the European Parliament and Council Regulation on the application of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)\u00a0adopted in July 2002, all listed European Union companies are required to prepare their consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS for fiscal years commencing on or after January\u00a01, 2005., 372249=Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, travel expenses, sales commissions and costs associated with advertising and other marketing activities. Selling and marketing expenses increased from \u20ac6.3 million or 5.4% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004, to \u20ac7.2 million or 5.6% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005, in line with increased production volume and in connection with\u00a0a higher\u00a0proportion of sales volumes primarily in Asia of products\u00a0subject to commission payments., 393602=We allocate our revenues to countries based on the location of the shipment destination. Changes in revenues from period to period have differed among geographical regions. As our customers have continued to increase their production in the greater China region and to add new Asian customers, regional growth was particularly strong in Asia in 2005, where revenue increased by 76% from \u20ac42.1\u00a0million for the year ended December 31, 2004 to \u20ac74.0\u00a0million for the year ended December 31, 2005. In Germany, we experienced decline in demand for our ASIC products where revenue decreased by 47% from \u20ac47.7\u00a0million for the year ended December 31, 2004 to \u20ac25.4\u00a0million for the year ended December 31, 2005, due primarily to the fact that one customer based in Germany relocated parts of the production to Asia. In 2004, regional growth was particularly strong in Asia where revenue increased 69% from \u20ac24.9\u00a0million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to \u20ac42.1\u00a0million for the year ended December 31, 2004., 223091=Dialog is a fabless semiconductor company that develops and supplies power management, audio and imaging technology, delivering innovative mixed signal standard products as well as application specific IC solutions for wireless, automotive and industrial applications.
