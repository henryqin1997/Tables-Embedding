He pointed out that meeting contributions was important. He added that states that made full contributions in 2010 were 84% funded on average, compared to those that did not, which were only 72% funded., 98860=Mr. Reynolds says he assisted his longtime employer with U.K. outdoor billboard deals, among other things. By early 2010, however, he stopped being busy for CBS, he recalls. \"I couldn't justify doing this [consulting] through August,\" he says., 87625=Of course, the Fed refuses to accept this reality. Even though a painful correction is necessary, nobody in power wants it to happen while they're in the driver's seat. So Bernanke will stick with his well-rehearsed lines: the money will flow until there is \"substantial improvement\" in unemployment. Does Bernanke Even Believe It? Even Bernanke must have a hunch that there isn't going to be any \"substantial improvement\" in the near term. I suggested before QE3 was announced that a new round of stimulus might be Bernanke's way of securing his job, but recent speculation is that he may step down when his current term as Fed Chairman expires. Perhaps he is cleverer than I thought. He'll be leaving a brick on the accelerator of an economy careening towards a fiscal cliff, and bailing before it goes over the edge. Whoever takes his place will have to pick up the pieces and accept the blame for the crisis that Bernanke and his predecessor inflamed. Don't Gamble Your Savings on Politics For investors looking to find a safe haven for their money, QE3 Plus is a strong signal that the price of gold and silver are a long way from their peaks. Gold hit an eleven-month high at the beginning of October after the announcement of QE3, but the response to the Fed's latest meeting was lackluster. When the Fed officially announces its commitment to QE3 Plus in December, I wouldn't be surprised to see a much bigger rally. For that matter, many are keeping an eye on the election outcome before making a move on precious metals., 36040=Professors' Political Identification, 2010-11, by Tenure Rank, 119433=As of the most recent Trustees' report in April, the net present value of the unfunded liability of Medicare was $42.8 trillion.

FCFS +5.17% in 2005., 117968=As a result, fiscal policy discussions generally focus on current-year budget deficits, the accumulated national debt, and the relationships between these two items and gross domestic product. We most often hear about the alarming $15.96 trillion national debt (more than 100% of GDP), and the 2012 budget deficit of $1.1 trillion (6.97% of GDP). As dangerous as those numbers are, they do not begin to tell the story of the federal government's true liabilities., 79018=Based on the Pew Center for the States report, \u201cThe Widening Gap Update,\u201d 24/7 Wall St. identified the nine states with public pensions that were 60% or less funded as of 2010. From the report, we considered the total outstanding liability, the total amount funded, and the proportion of the recommended contribution each state made in 2010. We also reviewed the level of funding for the 100 largest pension funds in each state, provided by Milliman\u2019s Public Pension Fund Study, which covered a period from June 30, 2009, to January 1, 2011., 46139=Coal is Still King, Sober Look, November 19, 2012 --- http://soberlook.com/2012/11/rail-freight-prices-rise-firms-able-to.html, 2180=After the 2012 elections 40 of the 50 states will have single-party control of both the executive and legislative branches of state government.\u00a0 However, the degree of control in the legislature varies. Passing legislation is nearly always more difficult in states with very large legislatures. For example, the sparsely populated New Hampshire has 400 Representatives, each of whom represents 3,300 residents on average. The populous State of California has only 80 representatives, each of whom represents nearly 500,000 residents on average. One of the reasons New Hampshire has no sales or income tax is that it's so difficult to pass new taxes among 400 Representatives, most of whom represent anti-tax districts no matter the party affiliation of the Representatives. In comparison Vermont's 150\u00a0 Representatives and California's 80 Representatives creatively tax everything under the sun., 5856=Stanford \u201cElection 2012\u201d Course Draws to Close with a Post Portem and Predictions --- http://www.openculture.com/2012/11/stanford_concludes_election_2012_course.html, 17632=After graduating from Stanford, where he specialized in First Amendment law, he joined the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, an organization co-founded in 1999 by civil-rights lawyer Harvey Silverglate and Alan Charles Kors, a history professor at the University of Pennsylvania, to counter the growing but often hidden threats to free speech in academia. FIRE's tactics include waging publicity campaigns intended to embarrass college administrators into dropping speech-related disciplinary charges against individual students, or reversing speech-restricting policies. When that fails, FIRE often takes its cases to court, where it tends to prevail., 115960=A decade and a half ago, both of us served on President Clinton's Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform, the forerunner to President Obama's recent National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. In 1994 we predicted that, unless something was done to control runaway entitlement spending, Medicare and Social Security would eventually go bankrupt or confront severe benefit cuts., 126395=Adding Pain to Misery in Medicare Funding of the Future \"The Dementia Plague:\u00a0 As the world's population of older people rapidly grows in the coming years, Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia will become a health-care disaster,\" by Stephen S.

For the year ending Dec. 31, 2011, the annual accrued expense of Medicare and Social Security was $7 trillion. Nothing like that figure is used in calculating the deficit. In reality, the reported budget deficit is less than one-fifth of the more accurate figure., 2007=After the 2012 elections only 10 of the U.S. states have bipartisan control.

Rauh, SSRN, September 16, 2012 --- http://papers.ssrn.com/SOL3/PAPERS.CFM?ABSTRACT_ID=1973668, 29696=The new data differ from some recent studies by groups other than the UCLA center that have found that professors (while more likely to lean left than right) in fact were doing so from more of a centrist position. A major study in 2007, for example, found that professors were more likely to be centrist than liberal, and that many on the left identified themselves as \"slightly liberal.\" (That study and the new one use different scales, making exact comparisons impossible.), 50529=Mr. Ludwig, the CEO of Promontory Financial Group, was Comptroller of the Currency from 1993 to 1998. Mr. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve System, is professor emeritus of international economic policy at Princeton University., 41084=Stanford Introductory Seminars --- http://www.stanford.edu/dept/undergrad/cgi-bin/drupal_ual/sites/default/files/common/docs/sis_IntroSemsCatalog1213.pdf, 65329=In July, Moody's MCO +0.09% proposed revising how pension funds calculate their discount rates, with the target for fiscal 2012 at a more realistic 4.1%. Under those assumptions, the gap is even wider than Illinois acknowledges. Meanwhile, the state's annual pension liabilities for 2013 are $5.9 billion, up from $1.6 billion a decade ago., 73343=In 2010, only Wisconsin\u2019s pension funds were fully funded. Nine states, meanwhile, were 60% funded or less \u2014 this would mean that at least 40% of the amount the state owes current and future retirees is not in the state\u2019s coffers. In Illinois, just 45% of the state\u2019s pension liabilities were funded. In some of these states, the gap between the outstanding liability and the amount funded was in the tens of billions of dollars. California alone had $113 billion in unfunded liability. Based on Pew\u2019s report, \u201cThe Widening Gap Update,\u201d 24/7 Wall St. identified the nine states with sinking pensions., 4118=The Republican edge is largely a result of the Republican trend in 2009 and 2010. Normally, you would expect the Democrats to recoup and shift the balance the next time they have a good off-year. Maybe they will in 2014., 96061=Smooth transitions are a big part of the plan. Advice from a predecessor proved useful during James D. Wehr's initial months as chief executive of insurer Phoenix Cos. PNX +3.92% Dona D.

Before he leaves office in 2016 he will probably make the ouchie better --- at least for Illinois., 64914=Here's some food for thought. The state estimates its unfunded pension liabilities at around $95 billion. But that rosy scenario is based on the assumption that pension investments earn some 8% a year. In fiscal 2012, the Teachers Retirement System had a 0.76% return, the State Employees Retirement System 0.05%, and the General Assembly Retirement System a negative 0.14%., 7469=The rolling conversation is moderated by David Kennedy (Pulitzer Prize-winning historian), Rob Reich, and Jim Steyer.

Plus we\u2019ve \u00a0catalogued Election 2012 in our collection of 550 Free Online Courses., 121810=Nothing like that $8 trillion amount is available for the IRS to target. According to the most recent tax data, all individuals filing tax returns in America and earning more than $66,193 per year have a total adjusted gross income of $5.1 trillion. In 2006, when corporate taxable income peaked before the recession, all corporations in the U.S. had total income for tax purposes of $1.6 trillion. That comes to $6.7 trillion available to tax from these individuals and corporations under existing tax laws., 101921=GE is quick to point out that Immelt skipped his $5.8 million cash bonus in 2009 for the second year in a row, because business did so badly.

(Most surveys that have included community college faculty members have found them to inhabit political space to the right of faculty members at four-year institutions.), 98526=A CBS Corp. CBS +2.65% finance chief who won a post-retirement consulting gig took an unusual approach after he no longer felt needed. Fredric G. Reynolds was due $100,000 a month for three months after leaving the media concern in August 2009, followed by $60,000 a month through August 2010., 22157=\"Even when we win our cases,\" says Mr. Lukianoff, \"the universities almost never apologize to the students they hurt or the faculty they drag through the mud.\" Brandeis University has yet to withdraw a 2007 finding of racial harassment against Prof. Paul Hindley for explaining the origins of \"wetback\" in a Latin-American Studies course. Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis apologized to a janitor found guilty of harassment\u2014for reading a book celebrating the defeat of the Ku Klux Klan in the presence of two black colleagues\u2014but only after protests by FIRE and an op-ed in these pages by Dorothy Rabinowitz., 96780=It doesn't always work out, though. In early 2008, Acxiom Corp. ACXM +1.27% promised to pay departing Chief Executive Charles Morgan $500,000 annually for up to three years of consulting. Mr. Morgan agreed to help his successor, John Meyer, strengthen the company's customer ties and advise on technology strategy, according to his consulting accord. But less than two months later, management stopped using Mr. Morgan's services. An Acxiom spokeswoman declines to say why. Per his accord, Mr. Morgan still collected $1.5 million.

Kachelmeier, 81857=In the media, Peter Schiff is the best-known financial analyst who publically predicted the economic collapse of 2008 long before it happened, including his predictions of the bursting of the real estate bubble. He did not, however, make as many millions on his predictions as several others who quietly gambled on the crash. Some of those heavily leveraged winnings, however, might've been due more to luck than the deep analysis of Peter Schiff --- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Schiff, 117066=As Washington wrestles with the roughly $600 billion \"fiscal cliff\" and the 2013 budget, the far greater fiscal challenge of the U.S. government's unfunded pension and health-care liabilities remains offstage. The truly important figures would appear on the federal balance sheet\u2014if the government prepared an accurate one., 14155=\"To say that I am disappointed with the judgment and maturity of the College Republicans . . . would be a tremendous understatement,\" Mr. McShane said in a Nov. 9 statement condemning the club's invitation to the caustic conservative pundit.

Scott Fitzgerald's 1920 novel \"This Side of Paradise\"), a quote that was banned at Yale when students put it on a T-shirt. Tufts University in Boston proscribes the holding of \"sexist attitudes,\" and a student newspaper there was found guilty of harassment in 2007 for printing violent passages from the Quran and facts about the status of women in Saudi Arabia during the school's \"Islamic Awareness Week.\", 47411=However, one relatively simple but critically important item should move to the top of the list: reforming the accounting rules that inexplicably prevent banks from establishing reasonable loan-loss reserves. If reserve rules had been written correctly before 2008, banks could have absorbed bad loans more easily, and the financial crisis probably would have been less severe. It is now time, before the next crisis, to recognize that reality., 41767=There are many other Introductory Seminar courses taught by many departments on the Stanford Campus.

When scanning all those Introductory Seminar courses I conclude the following, 123020=Neither the public nor policy makers will be able to fully understand and deal with these issues unless the government publishes financial statements that present the government's largest financial liabilities in accordance with well-established norms in the private sector. When the new Congress convenes in January, making the numbers clear\u2014and establishing policies that finally address them before it is too late\u2014should be a top order of business., 74957=Each year, actuaries determine how much a state should contribute to its pensions to keep them funded. Many states, for various reasons, did not pay the full recommended contributions for 2010, while others have been paying the recommended amount for years. In an interview with 24/7 Wall St., Milliman Inc. principal and consulting actuary Becky Sielman explained that despite states making the recommended payments, many large individual public retirement funds are still underfunded., 24604=\"A Different Ann Coulter Debate,\" by Scott Jaschik, Inside Higher Ed, November 12, 2012 --- http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/11/12/fordham-declines-ban-ann-coulter-her-invitation-rescinded, 95469=Kimberly-Clark Corp.

The senior vice president retired in June at age 57 after more than three decades with the company, and says he chose to limit his hours because he didn't want an \"onerous\" obligation., 64005=The Commercial Club of Chicago wrote that because the November elections did not bring in lawmakers willing to push real reform, the state's roughly $200 billion debt now threatens education, health care and basic public services. The problem is worsening so fast that the usual menu of reforms won't be enough to keep public pensions from sucking taxpayers and whole cities into its yawning maw., 83843=If no one seems to care that the Titanic is filling with water, why not drill another hole in it? That seems to be the M.O. of the Bernanke Federal Reserve. After the announcement of QE3 (also dubbed \"QE Infinity\") created yet another round of media chatter about a recovery, the Fed's Open Market Committee has decided to push infinity a little bit further. The latest move involves the rolling over of long-term Treasuries purchased as part of Operation Twist, thereby more than doubling QE3 to a monthly influx of $85 billion in phony money starting in December. I call it \"QE3 Plus\" - now with more inflation! Inflation By Any Other Name In case you've lost track of all the different ways the Fed has connived to distort the economy, here's a refresher on Operation Twist: the Fed sells Treasury notes with maturity dates of three years or less, and uses the cash to buy long-term Treasury bonds. This \"twisting\" of its portfolio is supposed to bring down long-term interest rates to make the US economy appear stronger and inflation appear lower than is actually the case. The Fed claims operation twist is inflation-neutral as the size of its balance sheet remains constant. However, the process continues to send false signals to market participants, who can now borrow more cheaply to fund long-term projects for which there is no legitimate support. I said it last year when Operation Twist was announced, and I'll continue to say it: low interests rates are part of the problem, not the solution. Interventions Are Never Neutral Just as the Fed used its interest-rate-fixing power to make dot-coms and then housing appear to be viable long-term investments, they are now using QE3 Plus to conceal the fiscal cliff facing the US government in the near future. As the Fed extends the average maturity of its portfolio, it is locking in the inflation created in the wake of the '08 credit crisis. Back then, we were promised that the Fed would unwind this new cash infusion when the time was right.

    "textBeforeTable": "Professors' Political Identification, 2010-11, by Sector \u00a0 In looking at the new data, there is notable variation by sector. Private research universities are the most left-leaning, with 16.2 percent of faculty members identifying as far left, and 0.1 percent as far right. (If one combines far left and liberal, however, private, four-year, non-religious colleges top private universities, 58.6 percent to 57.7 percent.) The largest conservative contingent can be found at religious, non-Roman Catholic four-year colleges, where 23.0 percent identify as conservative and another 0.6 percent say that they are far right. \u00a0 The new data differ from some recent studies by groups other than the UCLA center that have found that professors (while more likely to lean left than right) in fact were doing so from more of a centrist position. A major study in 2007, for example, found that professors were more likely to be centrist than liberal, and that many on the left identified themselves as \"slightly liberal.\" (That study and the new one use different scales, making exact comparisons impossible.) \u00a0 In the 1998-9 survey, more than 35 percent of faculty members identified themselves as middle of the road, and less than half (47.5 percent) identified as liberal or far left. In the new data, 62.7 percent identify as liberal or far left. (Most surveys that have included community college faculty members",

Among men, the figures were 12.2 percent and 47.2 percent, respectively. \u00a0 When it comes to the three tenure-track ranks, assistant professors were the most likely to be far left, but full professors were more likely than others to be liberal. \u00a0 Professors' Political Identification, 2010-11, by Tenure Rank \u00a0 Far left Liberal Middle of the Road Conservative Far right Full professors 11.8% 54.9% 23.4% 9.7% 0.2% Associate professors 13.8% 50.4% 24.0% 11.5% 0.4% Assistant professors 13.9% 48.7% 25.9% 11.2% 0.4% \u00a0 So what do these data mean? \u00a0 Sylvia Hurtado, professor of education at UCLA and director of the Higher Education Research Institute, said that she didn't know what to make of the surge to the left by faculty members.
