The food is consistently excellent, and sitting in the garden area on a breezy and cool day is a wonderful experience. I've never felt rushed to finish or leave, but I can say most of the servers are not overly attentive, but what's new in Brooklyn, from my experience anyways. I had my bday dinner there back in Feb on a crowded Sat night, with 12 guests, and for such a small place, they had our table ready to go right on time and it was a great time as a large group, sharing all the different tapas. Thankfully it's summer and the fabulous sparkling wine is back! I'd recommend to everyone and anyone!, 7986=Posted by Anoynymous2 on 11/07/2009, 5126=Posted by Jessi A on 04/18/2010, 6666=Posted by Anonymous on 01/03/2010, 9509=Posted by Sophie on 09/07/2009}",
