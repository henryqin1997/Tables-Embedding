            "Im on financial aid so its a good deal for me, but I would NEVER pay full price for this school.",
            "Frat parties are where its at, and the weekends can be filled with time spent at the two on campus gyms, the swimming pool, indoor and outdoor basketball courts, tennis courts, outdoor sand volleyball courts or at the track and field. Two free concerts a year thrown by the school and great speakers are often brought to campus.",
            "Horrible, your lucky to get food if there is a snow day which happens often as DC shuts down with an inch of snow.",
            "Ras are great and keep kids in line.",
            "Pretty hard, not overly extreme and professors are excellent and willing to help you succeed if your willing to put the work in.",
            "If you love public affairs, and want to work in government, this is an excellent school for you. School of public affairs is in the top ten I'm the nation and so is the School of International Service. Huge ROTC presence as well. Very liberal so conservatives may feel like a minority but that is play because there are many events for conservatives on campus too. Many great speakers come to American every semester as well.",
            "Very career oriented school, with lots of resources for finding jobs and internships in the heart of DC. Excellent for public affairs students and those with and interest in working in government or international affairs. Very liberal though, and dinning services is awful."

I think it is a good thing because they ensure that the students have the skills necessary to be successful in advanced classes, especially research. I took some college classes in my high school, and most of the classes transferred and were applied towards my degree., 464237=I went to go look at this school in February of 2013 when I was looking at Maryland CP, GWU, and Georgetown. I got on the campus and was immediately unimpressed, the entire campus was grey and drap and the people were less than friendly. Needless to say, I did not apply here., 243934=The dorms can be pretty cramped, especially as the school's popularity grows. But the campus is expanding starting in 2013 to add more dormitories, which will make dorm life more comfortable., 335901=There is one main dining hall - Terrace Dining Hall (better known as TDR) - with the classic stations of salad, grill, pasta/pizza, and wok. In 2013, there should be implemented several other food options, such as Elevation Burger and Starbucks. They will join the ones already on campus such as Einstein Bros. Bagels, Megabytes, Eagle's Nest, and Tavern (got to get the tenders!)., 106669=The capitol is no NYC, but there's rarely a quiet night downtown. There are plenty of clubs and concerts (a popular small venue is The 9:30 club) where well-known bands and DJs come to play. Tuesday nights there are live poetry readings at Busboys and Poets on K street. If you're not one to travel downtown often, there's plenty happening on campus! Sororities have hosted some dance parties in Mary Graydon Center, movies have been shown before they premier in theaters, local metal/alternative bands have played in the basement of the Kay Spiritual Life Center, a zip line was set up down the length of the quad, as well as a petting zoo! The list goes on for miles., 491298=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here DC is such a great environment for college students, because there's always something going on in the city. American is unique because it has a campus, while still being inside the city. Am learning a lot The professors here at American are some of the best I've met between visiting campuses or friends at other colleges. They are very approachable, and dedicated to their fields of study. I haven't met one yet that doesn't have some sort of higher degree, and all have extra activities going on outside being a teacher.
