A: I don't have access to the internet at the moment. I learned it from my mother who got a call from my agent. Q: Were you nervous? A: I actually wasn't too nervous. But the draft was on my mind all weekend. Q: Were you surprised that you were picked that early on, 94th overall? A: Absolutely. I did not expect to be picked before round 7. I'm very happy, of course. And I think it's somewhat of an appreciation of my efforts. Q: You actually missed a live television appearance on ESPN and TSN... A: Yes, the players picked in the first three rounds are presented on the podium with a team jersey and cap, and it's being broadcast all over North America. It",
