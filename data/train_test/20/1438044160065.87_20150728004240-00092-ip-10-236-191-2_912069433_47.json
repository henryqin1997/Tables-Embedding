            "They give you a choice of which dorm you would like to be in. On-campus housing/apartments are also available at Radford.",
            "Academic rigor at Radford is becoming more and more demanding.",
            "Set yourself challenging, but realistic goals that you want to achieve during the semester. Do not study the night before; start studying a week in advance up until the test.",
            "Radford's teacher to student ratio is the perfect size. Radford has a very good Communications of Sciences and Disorders program. Radford is not as diverse as I would like it to be, but it is growing each year."
