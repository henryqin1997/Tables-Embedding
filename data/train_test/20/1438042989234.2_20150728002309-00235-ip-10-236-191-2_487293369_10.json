    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6337=Cell viability assays showed that the viability of the cells was >95% in all the gels after 3 weeks of culture. Expression of endoglin could not be detected by western blot at either time point, indicating that all cells had started to differentiate. No expression of adiponectin and aggrecan could be detected at any point either. The expression of osteocalcin showed a marked difference between the gels and the controls. Whereas no osteocalcin could be detected in the controls, all gels expressed significant levels of osteocalcin at 7 days already rather than the usual 2-3 weeks (FIG. 3 a), but did not increase significantly at the 3 week time point (FIG. 3 b). The comparable expression levels at 1 and 3 weeks then imply that the expression levels of osteocalcin are constant during the culture period. Surprisingly, the expression seems to be independent on the concentrations of BMP-2 and the ratio is 1:2 between binding and no binding PA-containing gels. Moreover, the gels to which no BMP-2 was added show similar levels. Apparently, the endogenous BMP-2 levels produced by the cells themselves are enough to stimulate osteoblastic differentiation, but the capability of the binding gels to bind some of the BMP-2 lowers the amount of expressed osteocalcin slightly. The expression of osteocalcin could also be visualized with immunocytochemistry.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{21335=A class of peptide amphiphiles (PAs) is disclosed in one or both of two co-pending applications comprising a linear hydrophobic tail coupled to a peptide block that includes \u03b2-sheet forming segments, charged residues for solubility, and biological epitopes. The alkyl tail is attached to the N-terminus of the peptide, and the epitope segment is placed at the C-terminus. Upon application of a trigger such as a change in pH or ion concentration, these PA molecules can self-assemble in an aqueous medium into nanofibers. The alkyl chains are in the core of the fibers, with the epitopes displayed on the periphery for cell interaction. Epitopes that have been incorporated into the PA molecules mimic extracellular matrix proteins and promote cell adhesion or differentiation through cell signaling. It has also been shown that two different PA molecules with different epitopes and complementary charge can be co-assembled into the same nanofiber. See, co-pending application Ser. No. 10/368,517 filed Feb. 18, 2003 (international publication number WO 03/070749) and application Ser. No. 10/294,114 filed Nov. 14, 2002 (international publication number WO 03/054146), each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety., 74396=1H NMR (d6DMSO): \u03b4 0.81 (br-s, 21H, Val, +tail CH3), 1.21 (br-s, 31H, C14 aliphatic tail), 1.45 (s, 2H, Ala H\u03b2), 1.75 (m, 6H Glu H\u03b2), 1.94 (m, 9H, Val\u03b2+Glu H\u03b2), 2.24 (s, 6H, Glu H\u03b3), 4.2 (s, 9H, H\u03b1), 7.6-8.1 (Amide NH). ESI MS (MeOH:H2O 1:1 v:v): m/z=1177 (MNa+)., 95774=Co-assembly of PA 9 with the filler PA 2 could be demonstrated utilizing circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. At a concentration of 0.13 mM, the CD spectrum of the individual PA nanofibers at this concentration have predominantly random-coil character. When mixed together, however, the CD-spectrum reflects a pure \u03b2-sheet, illustrating that the PAs co-assemble within one fiber rather than form individual homo-fibers consisting of only one PA molecule. Co-assembly is energetically favored since the electrostatic repulsions are reduced when the KKK and EEE part form a complex. Additional evidence for co-assembly was obtained using Nuclear Overhauser Effect spectroscopy on 1.5 wt % solutions. Close contacts (<3 \u212b) were observed between the E\u03b2 and K\u03b5 protons and between the E\u03b2 and V\u03b4 protons and this distance would be significantly larger between homo-fibers. Other possible intermolecular contacts could not be attributed unambiguously. Finally, Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy on lyophilized samples and 1 wt % solutions showed the presence of the 1630 cm\u22121 peak typical of \u03b2-sheets. Similar results were obtained for 10/2 mixtures. Annealing of the samples for 24 h at 37\ufffd C. led to a significant increase in the strength of the CD effect. This increase is attributed to an increase in the size of the domain of perfectly coupled chromophores. Presumably, the initial mixing leads to the kinetic entrapment of a non-perfect mixed system and the annealing allows for the subsequent reorganization of amphiphiles to the thermodynamically most stable state. Even prolonged heating at 80\ufffd C., well above the expected melting temperatures for the hydrogen bonding network and the aliphatic tails, did not lead to any noticeable loss of supramolecular chirality, illustrating the high stability of the nanofibers., 49280=Various peptide amphiphiles of the present invention can be synthesized using preparatory techniques well-known to those skilled in the art, including those disclosed in the aforementioned incorporated publication WO 03/054146 and modifications of those originally described by Hartgerink, et al. (See e.g., J. D. Hartgerink, E. Beniash and S. I. Stupp, Science 294, 1683-1688, 2001), which is also incorporated in its entirety by reference. Also contemplated in the practice of this invention are branched peptide amphiphiles with which the synthetic methods and epitopes of the present invention may be used. Branched peptide amphiphile may be made by the using the methods and compostions as disclosed in the forementioned co-pending application filed concurrently herewith on Dec. 6, 2004, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Such a branched peptide amphiphle with a binding epitope could be self assembled into a nanofiber. The branched peptide amphiphile would have an alkyl tail portion coupled to the first end of a beta sheet forming peptide portion and at a second end to an epitope peptide portion that includes one or more peptide branches. The peptide includes branching amino acids and a charged peptide portion. The branched epitope peptide portion may be coupled to a second end of the beta sheet forming peptide portion of the peptide amphiphile. The binding epitope sequence for the branched peptide may be derived from a phage display process. The synthetic schemes set forth in these references may be applied to the present invention. Peptide amphiphiles may be in their fully protonated form, partially protonated form, or as acid or basic addition salts. Generally such peptide amphiphiles can be made by standard solid-phase peptide chemistry, as described in the aforementioned incorporated references or as provided herein. Modifications of these synthetic methods can be made as would be known to those skilled in the art and aware thereof, using known procedures and synthetic techniques or straight-forward modifications thereof depending upon a desired amphiphile composition or peptide sequence., 105241=Cells were fixed for 20 mins with 2% paraformaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde/0.2M sodium calcodylate at 4\ufffd C. After rinsing with PBS (2\ufffd), the samples were incubated for 5 mins with 0.1% Triton-X in PBS. Subsequently, the samples were rinsed with PBS (2\ufffd). Next, human osteocalcin monoclonal antibody (R&D systems, 1:200) in 1% BSA/PBS was added and the samples were incubated overnight at 4\ufffd C. After triple rinsing with PBS, FITC-conjugated secondary antibody in 1% BSA/PBS was added and incubated for 2 h. The samples were visualized after triple PBS rinsing on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000 microscope at 10\ufffd magnification., 92986=1H NMR (d6DMSO): \u03b4 0.82 (br-s, 39H, Val H, +tail CH3), 1.22 (br-s, 20H, C10 aliphatic tail), 1.53 (m, 6H, Lys H\u03b3), 1.69 (m, 6H, Lys H\u03b2), 1.93 (m, 16H, Lys H\u03b4+Val H\u03b2+Pro H\u03b3), 2.37 (m, 4H, Pro H\u03b2), 2.74 (br-s, 6H, Lys H\u03b5), 2.98 (m, 2H, tail CH2NH), 3.45 (m, 8H, Pro H\u03b4+His H\u03b2+Tyr H\u03b2), 3.72 (m, 3H, Thr H\u03b1+Thr H\u03b2), 4.1-4.6 (m, 13H, H\u03b1+Ser H\u03b2), 6.81 (m, 5H, Tyr Aromatic Hs+His H), 7.02-8.25 (Amide NH+His H). ESI MS (H2O): 773.9 (M+3H)+3., 59713=The peptide amphiphile with the binding epitope may be made by choice of a peptide sequences for the epitope that is capable of interacting with growth factors or other peptides such as but not limited to, amino acids, or nucleic acids, through non-covalent interaction. The degree of non-covalent interaction between the growth factors or other peptides and the peptide amphiphiles with the binding epitopes is chosen such that the epitope does not compete with or has less binding affinity for the growth factors or other peptides as compared to extracellular receptors. Passive release experiments may be used to characterize and subsequently modify the affinity of various nanofibers having growth factor binding epitopes. This characterization may be performed on self assembled nanofiber gels containing growth factors in pre-blocked microtiter plates. These gels may be prepared by first mixing 2% solutions of PAs in the appropriate ratio, followed by a 1:1 dilution with TBS. Growth factors may then be added followed by the addition of 2 equivalents multivalent ions to induce gelation and self assembly. The supernatant may be assayed for its growth factor content to access the growth factor binding capability of such gels., 97758=In order to test the physiological significance of this approach, mesenchymal stem cells were cultured in gels containing different levels of growth factors. For these cell experiments, the binding epitopes were diluted to a 50:1 (filler:binder) ratio to ensure recognition by the protein. Gels were prepared by mixing 50 \u03bcl of pre-mixed PA (2% by weight) containing the desired amount of growth factor and 50 \u03bcl mesenchymal stem cell suspension (100,000 cells) on glass cover slips, followed by the addition of 10 \u03bcl 30 mg/ml CaCl2 solution. The gels were allowed to solidify for 1.5 hours after which 1 ml of mesenchymal stem cell media was added. In this way, gels were prepared consisting either of 9/2 or 2 alone and containing 0, 1 or 50 ng/ml of BMP-2. As a further control, 10,000 stem cells were plated on glass cover slips with BMP-2 added to the media in identical concentrations. The media was refreshed every fourth day and triplicate samples were isolated after 7 and 21 days of culture. Subsequently, the protein expression of lineage-specific markers osteocalcin (osteoblast), adiponectin (adipocytes), collagen II and aggrecan (chondrocytes) and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and desmin (smooth muscle cells) was assessed by western blot., 93975=1H NMR (d6DMSO): \u03b4 0.82 (br-s, 21H, Val H\u03b3+aliphatic tail CH3), 1.22 (br-s, 20H, tail C10), 1.32 (m, 9H, Ala H\u03b2), 1.53 (m, 6H, Lys H\u03b3), 1.64 (m, 6H, Lys H\u03b2), 1.84 (m, 4H, Leu H\u03b2), 1.93 (m, 16H, Lys H\u03b4+Val H\u03b2+Pro H\u03b3), 2.37 (m, 2H, Pro H\u03b2), 2.74 (br-s, 6H, Lys H\u03b5), 2.97 (m, 2H, tail CH2 CH 2CONH), 3.45 (m, 4H, Pro H\u03b4+His H\u03b2), 3.72 (m, 3H, His H\u03b1+Ser H\u03b2), 4.10-4.61 (m, 9H, H\u03b1), 6.81 (m, 2H, His H), 7.02-8.25 (Amide NH+His H).

The membranes were rinsed 3\ufffd for 15 minutes with tris buffer saline/0.1% tween-20 (TTBS). Then, secondary antibodies were equilibrated for 1 h at a 1:3,000 dilution in 1% milk followed by 3 rinsing steps with TTBS. The membranes were developed by 1 minute equilibration with ECL western blot analysis solution (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to ECL hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences)., 71613=N-dodecyl-2-Fmoc-amino-succinamic acid (7). Into 200 mL of a water/dioxane (1:1 v:v) mixture, 6.6 mmol of 6 were dissolved with 1.3 mL (1.5 eq.) of triethylamine followed by 1 eq. of Fmoc-OSuccinimide (Fmoc-OSu). The reaction was monitored by TLC(CH2Cl2, 10% MeOH) and after 2-3 hours, all of the Fmoc-OSu was consumed.

    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, other versions are possible. For example peptide or protein sequences derived from a phage display process may be used to form binding peptide amphiphiles that bind and retain proteins other than growth factors. Enzymes could be coupled to form binding peptide amphiphiles which can be self assembled and immobilized on the surfaces of nanofiber hydrogels. Such hydrogels may be used as a coating for sensor applications. Alternatively, the binding interaction of the phage display derived peptide coupled to the peptide amphiphile could be selected to strongly bind peptides such as HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) or VEGF and treat various diseases and conditions by removing them. Hydrogels formed from self assembly of these binding peptide amphiphiles could be molded for insertion into a site on a patient or for use in a filtration system. The hydrogels could be used to remove target peptides like HGF or VEGF from a site such as a joint or tumor on a patient or from a fluid in a patient. As illustrated by the preceding examples, this invention provides a synthetic strategy for peptide amphiphile molecules with free N-termini compatible with standard solid phase methodology. When mixed with free C-terminus PAs, these molecules self-assemble into nanofibers containing highly thermally stable \u03b2-sheet structures which appear to be more stable than co-assemblies of",
