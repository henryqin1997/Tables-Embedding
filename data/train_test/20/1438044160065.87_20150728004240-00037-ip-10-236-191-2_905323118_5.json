    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{15484=9/17/14: Sometimes, it is nice to wish for more teams like the Tampa Bay Rays. They are a small budget team that has been very competitive over the past few years, and they seem to have fun doing it. They also do some unorthodox things - like signing Neil Wagner to an unusual two year minor league deal. Wagner had Tommy John surgery a month ago and will need all of 2015 to recover. The Rays showed their faith in the over-30 reliever by giving him a paid year to rehab and another to show what he can do. That rarely ever happens for a minor league contract, but the Rays are not your typical team., 10357=11/12/14: The Rays are technically the only team looking for a manager right now. Of course, in the cutthroat world of professional sports, almost any manager or coach can be replaced at any time if the 'right' guy becomes available (see: Chicago Cubs, October 2014). Tampa has started the interview process with Craig Counsell, Raul Ibanez and Don Wakamatsu. Other candidates include Dave Martinez, Manny Acta, Kevin Cash, Charlie Montoyo and Ron Wotus. The Rays are taking their time on this decision, but this is one of the more attractive jobs considering the talent that the Rays have in their organization., 11648=10/29/14: Two weeks ago, John Maddon said that he was \"Happy in Tampa\" and it looked like he would be staying on as manager of the Rays for the 2015 season. That was after the Dodgers announced they got former Rays boss Andrew Friedman on board. But Maddon dropped a bombshell last Friday when he opted out of his contract (a clause that apparently no one knew he had) and would be leaving the organization immediately. Of course the speculation is running rampant about if Maddon will join the Dodgers in some capacity in the near future. That will play out in time, but for now, the Rays have to find a new manager., 5433=3/11/15: Here is a good trivia question for fans of the Tampa Bay Rays: Who was the last pitcher not named James Shields or David Price to be the Rays Opening Day starter? Bonus points for the year. The answer: Scott Kazmir in 2007. None of those players are with Tampa any more, with Price being the last to leave when he was traded to the Detroit Tigers last summer. It is an entirely new Rays team and Alex Cobb gets the Opening Day nod. Cobb finished last year very strong with 14 starts in the second half, posting a 1.79 ERA to complement an 81/23 strike out to walk ratio over 90 innings., 9620=11/19/14: Anyone who has ever watched a baseball game at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg knows that it is just not a good venue. It was one of the last multi-purpose stadiums built - meaning it can host all sports but does none well. Aside from that, it is about an hour from where most people live in Tampa and one has to cross Tampa Bay to get there. The team has an albatross of a lease and the City of St. Petersburg has never been willing to let them out of the lease, which ends in 2027. But now there seems to be some progress on that front and the City may be willing to yield. The obvious spot would be a new stadium in downtown Tampa, though the new St. Pete mayor wants the team to stay in the city limits., 26914=4/24/14: Tampa, of course, does not have a long history, having only been in the league since 1998. So getting a franchise record is not as impressive as with, say, the Cardinals or the Yankees. Still, someone has to hold the record, so it might as well be one of the best players in franchise history. Evan Longoria claimed the franchise lead in home runs with his 164th last week. He took the title from Carlos Pena, whose 163 may as well have doubled as his batting average as he was known to hit it out of the park or go down swinging (far more often than not)., 6046=3/4/15: There have been a lot of rumblings in and around Tampa and St. Petersburg for the past few years about getting the Rays out of Tropicana Field and into a new stadium (preferably in Tampa). Tropicana Field is not a luxurious place to play or watch a game, and it is pretty far from the majority of the Tampa population. But the Rays lease goes until 2028, and there has been little real movement on relocating. Owner Stuart Sternberg now seems resigned to suffer through the next 13 years at the Trop, but admits that they will have to start preparing for a new home when the lease expires., 39173=The Tampa Bay Rays won the AL East in 2010, but are now forced to bear the loss of some great talent and will lean heavily on 3X All-Star Evan Longoria. After having a career season in 2010, Longoria won a Fielding Bible Award for his outstanding defensive play and the American League Gold Glove award for third base. Count on another solid season from this top performer., 29376=12/13/12: The Tampa Bay Rays and Kansas City Royals completed the biggest trade of the off season this week. The Rays sent established pitchers James Shields and Wade Davis for some of the top prospects in the American League. The big prize is Wil Myers who was named the Minor League Player of the Year in 2012. Myers was expected to be a major part of the Royals offense next season, and has been compared to Bryce Harper and Mike Trout. The loss of Shields will be tough fot Tampa, but the franchise has a lot of arms but not a lot of bats., 27497=4/17/14: It seems that every year the Rays bring in a low paid roster that can compete with the best teams in the league. And they are usually led by dominant starting pitching. This year looked to be more of the same, and indeed the Rays are only a game behind the Toronto Blue Jays for the AL East lead. Unfortunately this may be a tougher test than in previous years as starting pitcher Matt Moore is out for the season with an elbow ligament tear. He will require Tommy John surgery and is not expected to return to service until sometime in the 2015 season., 19155=7/24/14: The David Price rumors are swirling these days with several teams interested in him. Among those are the St. Louis Cardinals, Los Angeles Dodgers, Seattle Mariners and even the Chicago Cubs. The Cardinals and Dodgers can afford the trade but want a long-term commitment from Price. The Mariners may only want him to the extent of his contract which ends after the 2015 season. The Cubs would not be a competitive option now, but have the hitting prospects that the Rays want, and should be pretty good in a couple of years. All are interesting scenarios, but none may happen if the Rays keep winning., 29937=12/6/12: The Rays made another move to bolster their infield for 2013. A week after signing franchise thirdbaseman Evan Longoria to a $100 million, six year extension (that will likely keep Longoria in a Rays uniform throughout his career), the Rays traded for short stop Yunel Escobar with the Miami Marlins, for pitching prospect Derek Dietrich. Escobar never played for the Marlins, and was only acquired last month in a mega-deal between Miami and Toronto. The Rays also signed firstbaseman James Loney to a one year deal on Monday, which pretty much solidifies all of their infield shopping for now., 13576=10/8/14: The 2014 season turned out to be a washout for the Tampa Bay Rays. They got off to a slow start. They battled back to respectability. Then they traded their ace, which pretty much signaled that they gave up on the season. Then they turned around and got to .500 after being 18 games below at one point. Reality set in, and the Rays finished fourth in the American League East. At least they finished ahead of the Red Sox, right? But 2015 should be different. Matt Moore should be back and there should be more offensive talent available. The AL East is not the murderer's row it once was, so Tampa has a great shot at winning the division., 38108=11/22/12: Tampa needs offense. No one doubts that this organization can find and develop players - particularly pitchers. And they do so on a shoestring budget, yet still remain competitive in the AL East. But make no mistake, the Rays need to find some offense. One rumor is trading Jeff Niemann to the Angles for Kendrys Morales. It makes sense on paper - the Rays have pitching and need a bat. LA has bats and needs pitching. The big question is Morales' health. If he can return to 2009/2010 form, then this is a no brainer. If not, keep looking, Tampa Bay, keep looking., 33703=Interleague play has not been particularly kind to the Tampa Bay Rays this season, as they have suffered series losses to the Atlanta Braves, New York Mets, and most recently, the Washington Nationals. With an 8-10 record in games against the NL East this season, the Rays have fallen to third place in their own division, 3.5 games behind the first-place New York Yankees and 1 game behind the Baltimore Orioles in second. Thankfully, only one interleague series remains for the Rays, which will take place this weekend against the struggling Philadelphia Phillies, in a rematch of the 2008 World Series matchup., 7905=2/5/15: Tampa's season was lost just about as soon as it started last season. They dipped more than 10 games under .500 before getting back up to par, then promptly fell back down the ladder for the last half of the season. Pitching injuries plagued the Rays in 2014, with the loss of Matt Moore in April to Tommy John surgery. Fortunately, Moore is rehabbing well. He threw off of a mound for the first time last week. He will not be available for the start of the season, but should be back sometime in May if there are no setbacks., 14242=10/1/14: The Tampa Bay Rays have developed a nice little rivalry with the Boston Red Sox over the past few years. Even though both teams had down seasons, the lingering bad blood between the two teams remains - and that is good for baseball in Florida. The Rays are routinely criticized for low attendance, which is due in large part to the inaccessibility of the stadium. Like the Red Sox, the Rays abandoned any hope for the playoffs this season with their trade deadline moves. Also like the Red Sox, the team looks primed to get back to the postseason in 2015 when everyone gets healthy., 16103=8/28/14: Initially, Rays fans were disappointed with the trade that sent ace and former Cy Young Award winner David Price to the Tigers. The trade was inevitable as the Rays probably could not afford to keep Price past the 2015 season. But may were upset about the return they got - though the Rays have a great track record on these type of things. The team got to face their former ace last week and only managed one hit. Yet they won the game 1-0 because that one hit drove in the only run of the game. Maybe it is of little consolation, but they are proving that they can win without Price., 40339=2013 American League East Tickets AL East Standings MLB Opening Day News - American League East MLB 2013 Preview - The AL East As recently as October 2012, the New York Yankees still had a hold of their traditional top spot in the American League East and another playoff berth. However, an off-season riddled with\u2026, 38701=Tampa Bay Rays tickets allow fans to see one of baseball's youngest franchises play their way into the history books. The Tampa Bay Rays have enjoyed a great deal of success since a change in ownership in 2005, and look to add another pennant to their trophy case after making it to the World Series in 2008. Watch as the Tampa Bay Rays try to get back to the World Series in 2011!, 16715=8/21/14: There seems to be something wrong with this picture. The Rays supposedly gave up on the season and set their sights on 2015 when they traded away their ace, former Cy Young Award winner David Price. Price landed with the Tigers and the Rays pulled in a nice haul of young veterans who can play right away. But then the Rays went on to win five in a row. In doing so, they to the .500 mark. They became just the ninth team in MLB history to be 18 games under .500 and get back to even. Even stranger is that the organization also did it 2004. Tampa is still 6 games out of a wild card spot, but some big names above them have been falling fast lately., 8458=1/14/15: The Tampa Bay Rays have been pretty active this offseason, but their moves did not end when the Winter Meetings came to a close. Tampa traded away longtime utility man extraordinaire Ben Zobrist, as well as Yunel Escobar to the Oakland A's for catcher John Jaso, shortstop prospect Daniel Robertson and outfield prospect Boog Powell. Zobrist will be 34 in May, but still can play. He hit .272/.354/.395 with 10 home runs and 52 RBIs last season. He was owed $7.5 million for the upcoming season before being a free agent at the end of the 2015 season., 39627=Tampa Bay Rays tickets ensure that fans see the Rays playing top contenders throughout the entire MLB season. The Rays have their work cut out for them in a tough American League East. With matchups with great teams like the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox and non-divisional meetings with the St. Louis Cardinals throughout the season, the Rays are sure to be tested in 2011. Don't miss a second of the action!, 36784=As many expected coming into the season, the Tampa Bay Rays have played strong baseball in the month of April, and with an 11-7 record find themselves tied with the Baltimore Orioles for first place in the American League East. B.J. Upton returned to the lineup this week after beginning the season on the disabled list and did not waste any time making an impact - through 14 at- bats, Upton has already hit a home run and driven in six runs. Evan Longoria continues to lead the offense with a .328 batting average, while Carlos Pena's four home runs has him tied for the team lead with Luke Scott and Desmond Jennings.}",
