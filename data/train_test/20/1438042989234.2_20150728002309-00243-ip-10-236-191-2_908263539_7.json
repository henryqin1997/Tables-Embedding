            "Campus Safety is great here. They are always on call and will come where ever you need them. They will unlock your door if you are locked out and are very nice and caring.",
            "Pops is a wonderful Club here on campus that tries to get student involved and throws together parties and movies nights.",
            "Smc is a great place for athletes. Everyone comes out to games and supports other teams.",
            "They just built this new Cafe under Judd residence hall where there are, on some nights, karaoke contests and such.",
            "Well Spartanburg is a very populated city so there are plenty of things to do. Also, the school is only five minutes from downtown so your never too far from a good time. There are normally baseball and softball games going on on the weekends and occasionally a little game of pick football on the campus lawn.",
            "I never thought I would say this but the food is amazing. College cafeterias are normally gross but SMC really does a good job with variety and quality of the food.",
            "Dorm Life is great. You meet so many people and become close friends with all or your roommates and suite mates. Laundry is free and everyone is real respectful with you clothes and belongings.",
            "SMC is mediocre in class difficulty. I guess it just depends on the courses you are taking and the load of credit hours you have per semester.",
            "Taking and tour is key. The campus is very small but it can be kind of intimidating coming in for your first year in college. So take a tour and get to know the campus really well. Also, if you play a sport talk with the coaches here on campus they will be more than happy to talk to you and help you out with anything you need.",
            "Spartanburg Methodist College is small, two year college which is a great transition college for the high school student. The students and faculty are very helpful and are willing to go above and beyond for you. SMC is a great choice for graduating seniors."
