            "i haven't seen any crimes in my time being here and the officers are good people.",
            "i haven't had too much time to look into the clubs, but there are a lot here on campus and they provide useful information. there's even a quidditch club if you like running around on a broom.",
            "biking to campus is great, and in the winter the campus rents winterized bikes. there's also plenty of space for jogging.",
            "there are all kinds of events held on campus, and in the winter there is a great sledding spot by the gym.",
            "people who live on campus have to get a meal plan, there is no other option. most say the food isn't that great but its better than nothing. there are other places on campus for those who don't like the campus food, such as subway, pizza luna, taco bell, and a sushi place.",
            "the rooms are small, but you have high-speed internet, cable tv, local phone access, and a great bus system for getting around campus.",
            "some of the science classes can get difficult fast and have a bunch of online homework assigned.",
            "use the computer labs or the math lab, they're great places.",
            "this campus is great and the bus system is a plus for those without vehicles. the hot summers are nice and the cold winters not that bad if you dress warmly."

That's what I did, but I have heard from many how much more difficult it is to take a math course here, especially upper level. Also for transfer students, be sure to compare courses so that you transfer ALL of your credits; UAF is notoriously hard on transfer students. Other than that, in general, be prepared for an extremely cold winter: -30 to -40 degrees Fahrenheit is normal from November to February and maybe even March., 107656=On the campus, groups are always throwing activities. There is a Pub that has Karaoke and live bands play. Sometimes there are dance parties and every September there is Starvation Gulch, where groups on campus build multiple two story bonfires celebrating the anniversary of when the campus became no longer a dry campus., 168064=Pub opens at 4:30 during the week and noon on Fridays., 35030=After enduring -40 F temperatures and as little as 3 hours of sunlight the during winter months, students at UAF welcome spring with open arms. This celebration is Spring Fest. There are no classes on the last Friday in April, and the students engage in all sorts of outdoor activities., 44896=Spit in -50 degrees and watch it shatter as it hits the ground. Cross country skiing is fun and inexpensive to students if you rent skis at the Outdoor Adventures found in the Wood Center. There is one movie theater in the whole city of Fairbanks, but there is another one on the outskirts of town, if you can stand watching a movie in a barn. Chena Hot Springs is about an hour's drive from Fairbanks and is fun to go to in the winter to feel the extreme differences of temperature and watch your hair freeze. The Ice Park exhibits cool sculptures, literally, and the Pioneer Park offers mechanical engineering porn with its engines and whatnot. On campus, there is a gym of sorts. . . with a rock climbing wall. The Northern Lights are often very visible any time between December and February (about), although you might have to stay up a little late in the cold (or in a warm vehicle) to see them., 157699=Starvation Gultch: a celebration of the beginning of the school year dating back to 1914. There are usually 6 teams which build huge wooden structures, and then they are set on fire! SUPER AWESOME and so much fun. Don't get too close though... your face might melt off... There are underground tunnels that connect the buildings, 'cause we're cool and produce all our own electricity and heating. Join the -40 club and dance around the streets in your under-garments at night when its FORTY DEGREES BELOW ZERO. It's awesome fun, and you'll be the most hardcore person on the planet when you get home :), 171046=40 Below Club. You stand outside at -40 F or colder, in a bikini or swim trunks, (or in shorts and a tank top) and you take a picture standing in front of the sign. Every February, the engineering students build an ice arch., 266327=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 7422=My time at UAF so far has been nothing less than enjoyable. It was strange when snow first fell in the third weekend of September, but it quickly warmed up to 40 degrees for a week or two. Now (almost the winter solstice), the sun rises at 11:30 and sets at 2, and the average temperature is a tad cold at 30 below zero, but you walk into a building and the first thing you feel is a rush of hot air being provided by ceiling heaters! The food here is fairly decent. Being allergic to eggs, I find breakfasts a little challenging, but fruits, cereals, and yogurts are always available. For lunches and dinners, I have noticed that the vegetarian food is often better than the normal people food like the burgers, pizza, and rice. They have specialty meats every Sunday, which is a welcoming gesture to the students. Ohh! And the soft-serve machine is amazing!, 165857=Be prepared for cold, 2 months of highs around -20 F is not uncommon. Living expenses are high expect $1400/ living frugally., 206176=Cardio - the whole campus is one great, big hill! Don't skimp on the winter clothes, but it doesn't get really into the negatives until mid-November. Don't be shy about asking for help, and don't fall behind!, 239319=Average food. But it is being updated to a new building fall 2014., 142448=Starvation Gulch is a tradition celebrated at the end of September where there's a festival of sorts with massive bonfires, fire dancing and food to welcome new students. Spring Fest is another tradition where classes are cancelled and marks the end of winter with picnics and watermelon dropping from the tallest building on lower campus.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Don't be intimidated by the cold weather. You can always add more clothes whereas down south you can only take off so many. If you're looking for cold, or for a very unique experience, UAF is the place to be. Also, what will all of your friends back home think when you say, Yeah, you're going to Yale, but I'm going to Alaska! Bang for the buck Being an in-state resident here makes UAF really affordable. I'm paying the university (in advanced of course) $11.40 every hour I'm in class, which is really cheap comparatively. For out of state students I believe the cost per credit hour is $161 while for in-state is $141 (Undergraduate class rates). Either way, UAF receives millions of dollars in funding by both state and federal sources to do undergraduate and graduate research projects, and to give to its students as scholarships. UAF is primarily an engineering school and has many opportunities for funded projects and cold-climate housing sustainability retrofitting. In addition to just the class costs, it is affordable to live and eat on-campus, and the fee for the gym (which I use very often as well as the ice rink and the swimming pool) is really cheap for the semester.
