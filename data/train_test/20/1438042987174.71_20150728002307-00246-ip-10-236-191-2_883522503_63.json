    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{23745=Between the middle of July, the Summer before you attend, and the first two weeks of school, you will likely make the mistake of accepting Facebook requests from the presidents of the sororities and fraternities. They will then bombard you with opening weekend party invitations, which at first will seem like fun. Then you will attend one. One of two things will happen: 1. You will enjoy your time, and then be recruited to join one of the sororities/frats. or 2. You will realize what a complete waste of time it is to stand around drinking, wearing revealing clothing, and being hit on by members of the opposite sex (because the Greek system is incredibly heterosexual-not a criticism, just an observation-) who will most likely not remember your name in the morning. The Greek system here is heavily funded by the Undergraduate Student Government, since it attracts a lot of people. Very little of that funding, however, is put to good use. The frats and sororities, which are all off campus and require a cab ride to get to, throw parties in an attempt to create a scandelous image, though the result is merely a stuffy, low-class house party with techno beats and beer tap-stained furniture. These students involved have an obnoxious sense of entitlement to USG funds, and an inflated self-image. College is supposed to be a transitional time from child to adulthood, a time in which you become a responsible adult. What actually happens here is that children go crazy without limitations and take no responsibility for their actions. I don't mean for my review to read like the outline for an after school special. I am not condemning the choices people make, but rather the lack of responsibility that is assumed when making those choices. About once a month, I will go wine tasting in the city, buy my two drink minimum at a comedy club, or go to some of the clubs in the city. However, I am always in good company, I am networking, I am doing things relevant to my major, and still manage to have fun. I subscribe to peoples that will contribute to a positive reputation, as opposed to joining the Greek system which, at Stony Brook, will do very little in contributing to a positive future. The Greek system at SBU provides minimal, temporary escapism. Their events' impermanence and lack of passion for anything specific so transparent that even the students involved with the Greek system will admit to this lack of direction, they just don't care., 688933=Food was extremely overpriced for average food. It's a meal point system where you pay more dollars than the points you get. Also, a california roll can range from 8-13 points/dollars. The system is basically dollars, but they take away about $600 to cover late night dining hours, theft, etc. BUUUT, they just changed the dining system as of Fall 2015., 107223=The academics here are pretty intense, especially as you take higher classes/honors courses. If you want to tackle the higher and especially honors courses from the start (freshman year), you better make sure you have had rigorous training in high school! The science and math courses are especially vigorous. Even the honors chem LAB class was vigorous! If you have an evil TA for 8:30 a.m. chem lab (like I did), you are in for quite a treat. But if you manage your time and make use of the resources on campus (free tutors, quiet study rooms in building, quiet areas of library, office hours, etc.) you will certainly be successful., 67386=Getting together with friends for dinner, participating in game nights, dance classes, going to concerts or the shows of comedians that visit the school and taking trips to the city every opportunity you get will make your college years at Stony fulfilling. After studying long and hard for a midterm, take a day to unwind and enjoy your roommates or friends. Specifically, I enjoy attending the division one basketball games especially as March approaches and games are intense!, 625358=Roth Rogetta is an event on May that students makes boats with only cardboards and duct tapes. It is really fun to enjoy; smaller events happens every day! You will love if you are a party animal., 690957=Stony Brook is filled with friendly students and a 50:50 chance of getting a nice professor. A popular college choice for asian students and commuters. Pretty quite on the weekend if you're the type of person who doesn't make friends and won't have small suite/dorm parties., 564483=The Roth Regatta is an annual event in April where clubs construct boats out of cardboard and duct tape and attempt to sail across Roth Pond. I have participated in this event, and although the lake can be messy it was a lot of fun! Lots of students and faculty go and all clubs can be involved., 528222=There is no traditional meal plan. Everything is priced in the dining hall (pizza, $3.29, soda, $2, etc.) each meal plan also includes a $564 operating expense which further inflates costs. You can expect to pay up to double for meals at SBU as other schools. Selection is moderate, with most items offered most day, lacking sufficient variety. A new dining hall near Roosevelt and Kelly Quads should be open for Fall 2013, hopefully reducing lines and wait times. Food service is available at some locations until 3am., 560898=Wait until September 21st to visit so that you can go on an actual guided tour of the campus., 47024=I completed my first semester here as a transfer student in Spring 2011. The adjustment was quite difficult, especially with over 20,000 students. My class sizes were mainly 250+ students. You need to reach out to your professors and TAs for individualized attention. They are very friendly. Even though the class sizes were huge, I learned a lot., 695238=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 103992=There's a Strawberry Festival every spring where you can buy as many strawberry-related things as you want (jams, pies, cakes, fresh strawberries, etc.) for only $5-$6! Everyone looks forward to this event in April/May.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Don't come to Stony Brook with expectations of a state school experience. The campus is diverse and edifying beyond the limits of the state its in, and will be most rewarding to students who come in with an open mind and who are willing to work with the resources and students on campus. Bang for the buck The resources and experiences available to SBU students are incredible considering how affordable the school is, especially for in-state students. Aside from the classes, there are such places to explore as the Staller Arts Center, which offers a variety of professional and student performances for those on campus to enjoy. Am enjoying being here SBU has very much a welcoming feel to it. The faculty and the other students are accommodating and friendly, and there is a sense of community among all who attend. There is also always something to do on campus, whether it be student or administration organized, and there are constantly things to get involved in outside of classes. Am learning a lot As at any school, at Stony Brook you get out of the experience what you put in, and the most rewarding class will be the one",
