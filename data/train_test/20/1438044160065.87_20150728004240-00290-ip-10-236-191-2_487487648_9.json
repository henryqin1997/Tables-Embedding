    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention has been described and illustrated with respect to the exemplary embodiments thereof, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and various other changed, omissions and additions may be made therein and thereto, without parting from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Although those skilled in the art will immediately recognize the variety of arrangements that these discretized locations may have, examples of \u201cregular\u201d arrangements include a \u201cwindow-pane\u201d arrangement, wherein rectangular regions of moisture-absorbing and/or liquid-permeable layers are separated by regions where the materials/characteristics of these layers are not present, and a \u201cstriped\u201d arrangement, wherein the cover includes strips where the materials/characteristics of the moisture-absorbing and/or liquid-permeable layers are alternatingly present and not present. This type of discretization of the moisture-absorbing and liquid-permeable layers is applicable to any embodiment containing such layers. Other layers, such as a separate corrosion inhibitor layer or a radar-influencing layer, may be discretized in a similar manner in any embodiment containing such layer(s). Of course, alternatively these layers, too, may be coextensive with the cover. Similarly, in embodiments wherein a corrosion inhibitor, radar-influencing material, or other material is incorporated into one or more of the liquid-impermeable, moisture-absorbing, and/or liquid-permeable layers, as the case may be, the corrosion inhibitor or radar-influencing material may be placed in discretized locations with respect to the area of the corresponding cover. In each of the above",
