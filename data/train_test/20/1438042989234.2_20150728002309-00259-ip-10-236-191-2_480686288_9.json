    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{118320=In general, the gateway 1042 may comprise one or more computers tasked for allowing communication between the processing service 104 and the plurality of merchants' location-base devices. Such a task may include, but not limited to, routing incoming and outgoing data, providing a firewall that inhibits unauthorized access, and providing a secure link between the processing service 104 and the subscribing merchants (via, for example, encrypted communication link)., 118841=The processing service 104 further comprises an authorization component 1040 configured to authorize or decline check transactions. In one embodiment, the authorization component 1040 is configured to authorize or decline acceptance and processing of AR checks received by the merchant 102 in a manner described herein., 107290=It will be appreciated that the exemplary in-person option 1122 and the ARC option 1124 may be considered as two types of check transactions processed by the POS device 124. Thus, these two options may be thought of as two identifiers for the two types of check transactions, and selection of one of the options invokes check processing under the corresponding identifier. One use for having such an identifier is for keeping track of how much transactions are performed under the selected identifier. The concept of the POS device being configurable to handle multiple identifiers is described below in greater detail., 134902=The process 1010 begins in a start state 1012, and in step 1014 that follows, the process 1010 induces scanning of one the checks having the same check amount. In step 1016 that follows, the process 1010 applies the common check amount to the scanned check. In step 1020 that follows, the process 1010 prompts for and obtains other input(s). In step 1022 that follows, the process 1010 determines whether another check with the same amount is to be scanned. If the answer is yes, the process 1010 loops back to step 1014 where scanning of another check is induced. If the answer in no, the process 1010 in step 1026 returns the POS device to the main menu. The process 1010 then ends in a stop state 1030., 122041=The exemplary authorization component 1060 comprises a processor 1080 that accesses information related to the check transaction and determines whether to authorize or decline the transaction. In one implementation, the processor 1080 accesses the merchant profile database 1046 having information about a plurality of merchants. For example, an exemplary merchant \u201cA\u201d has associated with it a profile 1062. Such a profile may include merchant name, billing control number, check acceptance level, check transaction edit capability, etc., 123930=In one implementation, the processor 1080 obtains information about the merchant from the merchant profile database 1046, and uses at least some of that information to perform a risk assessment (indicated by a block 1064). Thus, a merchant data input 1072 may be obtained in the foregoing manner. Other inputs such as a check data input 1066 and a customer data input 1070 may also be obtained in a similar manner. The exemplary data 1066, 1070, and 1072 are depicted to be inputs into a risk engine 1074 that performs a risk analysis process and outputs a risk score 1076 that is indicative of the risk of the check transaction. Other factors such as the potential profit associated with the processing of the check transaction may also affect the authorize/decline decision., 44529=This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/418,780, filed May 5, 2006, now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7,299,979, which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/695,401, filed Oct. 27, 2003, now issued as U.S. Pat.
