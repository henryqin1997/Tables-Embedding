The only other game of that type that the Twins have had was on April 12, 1994 when they were blanked 12-0 and committed five errors against the Mariners in Seattle.\u00a0The last major-league team with that dismal a performance was the Rays, who were pummeled 13-0 by the Yankees while committing four errors on May 16, 2002 at Yankee Stadium.}",
