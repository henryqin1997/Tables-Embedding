No. 6,085,152., 28169=The cameras 12, 14, and 16 are preferably high resolution digital cameras, such as for example the Kodak Megaplus Model ES 1.0 Progressive Scan, 1024\ufffd1024 pixel CCD, high resolution camera. As shown in FIG. 2, the local processor 30 includes a main processor 31 connected by a bus 33 to each of the cameras and the laser ranger, a local disk storage 35 and a high-speed access memory 39. Each camera has a digital I/F, a buffer memory, a digital signal processor, and a direct memory access DMA stage to pre-process the pixel data, which is stored on the local disk 35 and/or the RAM 39., 47483=The observation camera 14 can image better than the naked eye in the presence of atmospheric haze and also gives a marginal improvement in the case of fog and darkness. A haze filter is used to block some of the blue wavelengths in the visible spectrum and at the same time the camera makes use of some of the intrinsic near infrared (NIR) sensitivity of the detector. It has a sensitivity ranging from 550 to about 1000 nm. This proves to be especially beneficial because the intrinsic scattering of the atmosphere, on a molecular level, is dominated by the blue wavelengths. With the addition of atmospheric haze due to high humidity conditions, blue scattering increases. The result is that the amount of energy coming to the detectors will be dominated by radiation scattered into the detector's optical path from the atmosphere itself, rather than directly from the cloud. The net effect is that there is a loss of contrast and resolution. Applying a filter with a cutoff wavelength of about 550 nm, midway through the visible spectrum, significantly reduces this component of the detector signal.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes While the invention has been described in terms of a single preferred embodiment, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. In a typical system, a complete cycle of the system making and reporting visibility, cloud, and surveillance observations will take about five minutes. However, in certain situations, in response to a user input, for example, the system could be commanded to execute a cycle of visibility only measurements and report. For example, this would take less time, on the order of one minute. In addition, the system could be commanded to slew directly to a given point in order to make an immediate observation, for example, a surface surveillance observation. FIG. 8 illustrates a graphical user interface and display for the system. In this preferred embodiment, the display screen displays a pictorial image 61 of the cloud cover or ground under surveillance. A current view data box 62, tells the user the camera azimuth and elevation at which the displayed pictorial image was taken, along with the cloud height at that azimuth and elevation. A current weather box 63 displays the ceiling and visibility calculations along with the time at which those calculations were made. A user interface 66, which resembles a spider web, allows the use conveniently to select an azimuth angle and elevation he or she",
