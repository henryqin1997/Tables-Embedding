While you are likely starting most of the receivers on this list, in season long leagues, it now becomes even more important than ever to check the weather conditions in any format, but arguably even more so in your Daily League contests. If you do not feel like playing weather man each week you can always join our Fantasy Alarm Sunday Morning Live Start/Sit Chat from 10am till game time here: \u201cAsk the Experts\u201d and we will do it for you. In the meantime, here is a deeper look at some of this week\u2019s target winners: Welcome to another week of our Pass",

So, although the Texans are struggling, Fantasy Owners of Dre\u2019s should be fine going forward. * Bowe\u2019s day almost went up in smoke if it weren\u2019t for him reaching the end zone for the first time since Week 4. Bowe has now been targeted 25 times over his last two games, which accounts for more than a third of his total targets on the season. \u00a0The increase in targets alone make Bowe worth rolling out there again in Week 12, despite having caught only 44% of his targets, with three drops, that past two games, and no I\u2019m not stoned, just hopeful, but then again every time I buy into Bowe all I get is bunk. So, in this theme, you might like this hippity hop song by RBL Posse, which has a catchy tune that you can sing to Bowe as you hit submit while placing him in your lineup in",
