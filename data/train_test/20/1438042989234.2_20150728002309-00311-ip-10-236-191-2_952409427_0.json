If you are between sizes or need assistance selecting the proper size, please contact Customer Service Designer Fashion veteran Diane von Furstenberg arrived fresh on the NYC fashion scene in 1970, armed with a friendship with Vogue editor Diana Vreeland and 12 shirtdresses she'd made in Italy. By 1976, von Furstenberg had already gained renown in the fashion sphere with the invention of her iconic wrap dress. With vintage-inspired prints and feminine silhouettes, every DVF design is built to flatter the woman who wears it: a philosophy that has become von Furstenberg's legacy and her gift to the women of the world.
