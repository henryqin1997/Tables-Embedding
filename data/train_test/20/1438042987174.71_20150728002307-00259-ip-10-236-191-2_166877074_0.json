I agree with JayB that they should net 10+ wins and it would be disappointing to have less than 75. I would expect mid-70's in wins with a remote chance at 81 which is +9 from the 2010 pythagorean. My hesitation is 18 games against the Phillies and games like Opening Day and Aug 22 2010. Now Halladay, Lee, and Oswalt as the best 1,2,3 in the MLB where Hamels and Blanton are what you hope to face in each of the 6 series to have a good chance of a W.The Nats went 6 and 12 last year vs. the Philllies with 68 runs scored against 107 given up.If the Nats can go 6 and 12 against the Phillies this year and improve against the Marlins 5 and 13 that is how they get to 81 wins.Riggleman has to turn the tables on the Marlins in 2011 for the success needed., 31015=Mark'd \u2013 I think of the saying, garbage in garbage out. You have to draft well and smart. Not saying Detwiler was garbage but some say that Ross Detwiler who was a pivotal pick by the Nats as the 6th overall pick in Lerner's 1st draft never had a power pitchers frame for a guy coming out of College and that was the problem from the start. Then the Nats pick Josh Smoker and Michael Burgess to complete their 1st round.The other side of it was the Nats wanted a College pitcher as they wanted a quick line to the Pros and the depth wasn't there in 2007 for College pitchers. The Pirates took Daniel Moskos with the 4th overall pick out of College and he has been a complete dud., 59721=* Mock \u2013 Rizzo drafted the guy in Arizona,Let's assume for a moment that Rizzo, Clark, Kline, Minnitti are real baseball men \u2026 not politicians?Looking at our starters for 2011 in terms of the \"velocity\" or power pitcher factor:Fast ball velocities listed to the rightPOWER PITCHERS______________________________________________________Stephen Strasburg 97.6 [injured in 2011]Jordan Zimmermann: 92.2 (93.1 in 2009)Craig Stammen: 90.4 (89.2 in 2009)Tom Gorzelanny: 90.2 (91.1 in 2009)Ross Detwiler: 89.8 (93.2 in 2007)Yuniesky Maya: 89 (Had not pitched in 1.5-2 years. It will rise.)___________________________________________________________________SOFT TOSSERSJohn Lannan 88.6 (88.1 in 2009)Luis Atilano 88.6 Garrett Mock: 88.3 (91.3 in 2009) [power pitcher again?]Jason Marquis 87.2 (90.5 in 2009, 90.1 in 2008)Livan Hernandez 84.4 (85 in 2009, also 2nd to last in category)Chien-Ming Wang 00 (92.2 in 2009, 93.7 in 2007)[injured] *** can he get that velocity back? ****Fangraphs is your friend so \u2026 based on the criteria that to improve to .500 or above (given all the other improvements) the Nats will need power pitchers at the top of their rotation to perform. THIS IS DEFINITELYNOT LIvan Hernadez whose velocity continues to diminish., 40120=Here's what I learned today. Fangraphs is the one true gospel and Bill James, meh, he can be ignored.\"Even on fangraphs they speak to having \"power pitchers\" at the top.\"\"I don't care what Bill James says it won't happen.\"I prefer original thought, like when BinM annointed Livo as the Nats Ace for all of 2011 and beyond., 52132=Of your top-five, only Gorzelanny has ever thrown over over 200IP in a season, and that was what, three years ago? Gorzelanny pitched almost 140 last year after spending parts of the season in the bullpen with the Cubs. That's about what Lannan did last year for comparison. No one else even came close (except Livo). NONE of the Nats homegrown starters have EVER come close \u2026YET. Some in that pack of five top (after Stras) needs to have a breakout year. Just by your criteria alone Gozelanny has to be considered the top starter coming out of ST 2011.or the Nationals, Livo, Lannan, and even Marquis serve that purpose. It isn't all about the heat for a starter,Leads to last place finishes or just above as we have seen.The top of the rotation has to improve and be productive in order for the Nats to have any chance of reaching .500., 169642=Mike Rizzo has officially served as GM of the Nationals for 17 months (22 months if you count the period from March-August 2009 when held an interim title) and it's no secret he's made some significant changes during that time., 170444=Jan 28, 2011, 4:07 PM EDT, 138327=Are there any players on the current roster, who are not likely to be on the 2012 roster (Marquis, Pudge, etc) who have any chance to be Type A or Type B FA?, 156771=Bowden was mediocre but was also hamstrung by the tightfisted Lerners. His trade for Kearns and Lopez made sense but never worked out. The trades for Clippard and Detwiler were successful. His trade for Willingham and Olson was successful despite Olson being injured much of the time. As an aside, Rizzo's trade of Willingham will be foolish if Corey Brown doesn't cut it. The Dunn signing was excellent while Rizzo's decision not to re-sign Dunn was foolish. Bowden made a few good draft picks which are listed and some who didn't pan out.As for Rizzo, he was lucky that the niggardly Lerners of 2005-2008 provided the means to a lack of success in 2008 and 2009 which allowed Rizzo the good fortune to make the obvious first picks in the draft- Strasburg and Harper. Even Rizzo could not screw those picks up. Rizzo was also fortunate that the Lerners finally reached for the crowbar in their gold-laden wallets to pay for talent. Strasburg and Harper didn't come cheap and Rizzo overpaid for a rightfielder who was an Major League baseball afterthought until 2008.So what of the Nats future? For 2011, the starting pitching this season is near the worst in the National League. Despite the addition of Werth, the outfield is one of the worst in the National League. At second is a rookie and at short is a real talent who makes too many errors. Catching and first-base are average. Third-base is where the star is but one who is deeply unhappy that Rizzo didn't choose to keep Dunn and Willingham. My bet is that Ryan Zimmerman flies the coop when his contract is up. As for beyond 2011, if Strasburg comes back from injury as an ordinary pitcher, Jordan Zimmerman proves to be mediocre, Harper proves to be more a later-day Shawn Abner rather than Ken Griffey Jr. and Werth wilts under the pressure of playing for a bad team for a lot of money, Rizzo will be out of a job five years hence., 75076=Late to the party, but I did want to mention my favorite rain delay game, which I don't think has mentioned already \u2013 at Yankee Stadium in June 2009. Lannan had won the second of the three game series the night before, and a day game was scheduled \u2013 web info said it was on, so we went to the park and it was absolutely pouring. The game was delayed for about six hours. The Yankees and the Nats only had one common off day for the rest of the season, which would have required both teams to come back to Yankee Stadium, and the Yankees particularly wanted to get the game in because they figured to win it. All afternoon we watched games around the leagues up on the big screen, waited in a line to see the Yankees' Museum, etc., then finally it started about 6:30 pm. After the first half inning we were all invited to come down to the ground level seats (not across the moat, however)-in my cynical opinion, to make the sparse crowd look better for television \u2013 and we were all given rain checks for a non-premium game for 2009 or 2010. Best of all, Nats won, and Craig Stammen won his first major league game ever, so got his pie in the face at Yankee Stadium!, 82849=VladiHondo, appreciate your post and points.I think DFL's characterization of our catching in 2011 as average is a perfectly reasonable assessment. While the depth of Ramos, Flores, Norris is certainly an organizational strength, performance from the C position in 2011 will likely be average, or worse. Pudge seems likely to play perhaps 5 out of 8 games, and he'll hit .225 with no power and a high rate of DP's. So this year, looks like we'll get better than average defense and worse than average offense from the C Spot. It only will be better than this if Flores and Ramos thrive and Rizzo has the courage to move Pudge, and this is a series of unlikely events.I think most of the rest of DFL's assessment is overly pessimistic. The whole notion of Zim as unhappy is silly. I'm looking forward to watching this team in 2011. There will be some disappointments, but some real positive developments as well., 154238=Even I do not see it as bad as that\u2026.but I do think Rizzo will lose his job after 5 years\u2026.because as Boz put it in his last chat\u2026..Lerner's waited way to long to start spending\u2026.the reputation and losing culture was set in stone between 2007-2010\u2026.I hope Rizzo gets lucky and the team wins 85 games this year\u2026.if not, as you all know I see really bad things coming next off season\u2026nobody will sign here and DFL is correct Zimm will leave ASAP, 120227=Where they really need to shine is in the later rounds where its a lot harder to find successful picks. We have to pick better than the other teams.Both KC and Tampa Bay managed to rebuild their systems. Hopefully Rizzo will be able to do the same job that Dayton Moore and Andrew Friedman did. I guess we'll have to wait and see. About a month or so after Dayton Moore took over as the Royals' GM, he told me that he was alarmed to find how little pitching inventory he had in his new farm system and that addressing that vacuum would be a major priority for his front office. The phrase \"Mission Accomplished\" has acquired an ironic connotation of late, but if anyone could use the phrase earnestly to describe his own efforts, it would be Moore, as the Royals have arms coming out of their ears.However, the Nats and Rizzo did manage to get one of Keith Law's thirty \"sleepers\".A.J. Cole fell out of the first round in 2010 after an up-and-down spring and high bonus demands, but the Nationals ponied up and got themselves a big power arm who will show you 97 when he's right with the strong legs that point to a future workhorse body., 97584=Some reject that the Nats catching is average for 2011. How can the catching be considered anything more? The starter, Ivan Rodriguez, is 39 and declined badly at the plate last season after a strong start. He has little power any longer. Who knows if he collapses this season? The backup, Wilson Ramos, has less than 100 Major League plate appearances and has all of one home run, four doubles and 5 RBIs to his name. Jesus Flores will most likely start in Syracuse. He missed all of last season and missed most of 2009 due to a severe injury. Who knows whether he will come back. Calling the Nats catching average may be stretching the situation., 48647=Finally, the rule 5 guy who went 11-2 for the Cards AA club:Brian Broderick: 91-92 mph fastball consistently tops out at 94-95.If we now throw Broderick into the list of Nats power pitching starters on the big club:Stephen Strasburg 97.6 [injured in 2011]Jordan Zimmermann: 92.2 (93.1 in 2009)Brian Broderick: 91-92.Craig Stammen: 90.4 (89.2 in 2009)Tom Gorzelanny: 90.2 (91.1 in 2009)Ross Detwiler: 89.8 (93.2 in 2007)Yuniesky Maya: 89 (Had not pitched in 1.5-2 years. It will rise.)If the Nats execute a trade for Broderick and manage to put him in AAA somehow? (Not sure how that would work?)Ryan Tatusko RHSP | 93-94 as high as 97 for H'burg in 2010helped get them to the playoffs.Bradley Peacock RHSP | 92-95 [h'burg -> Syracuse] ranked prospect.Jimmy Barthmaier RHSP | 91.6 in 2009. [coming back from TJ]Brian Broderick RHSP | 91-92.Shairon Martis RHSP | 90.2 in 2009., 87479=Anon@6:42. Moore is a good example. By all accounts, he has built a great farm system. On the other hand, he has been abysmal at talent acquisition at the major league level. Meche, Guillen, betancourt, our very own Ankiel, all of these were terrible acquisitions (meche actually had a few good years, but otherwise underperformed that contract). So while the farm system is a great start, they don't always pan out they way you think, and if he doesn't demonstrate a better ability to assess and acquire major league talent, they likely won't achieve the level of success they hope for. Even Tampa, the poster child for building through the farm system, wouldn't have made their run without major league acquisitions Pena, Zobrist, akinora, even Jackson (I give them credit for Garza because they got him for Delmon Young), 131807=2012 will be a rehab year for Strasburg. Part of which might be spent in the minors. Again, why they either need another pitcher through trade or someone has to finally step up among Mock, Detwiler, JZimmnn, and Maya. If both things were to happen \u2026, 47151=For the record, based on total 2010 appearances (majors & minors) for SP staff\u2026Livan Hernandez \u2013 33GP, 33GS, 211.7IP.

The Nationals will still need 9-10 SP's to get through the 2011 season, at the very least, imo. JZimm will likely be shut down at 150+IP, as will Detwiler, Wang & Mock. Gorzelanny might get 160-170IP, along with Atilano, Chico, & Martis (if they stay). There will undoubtably be callups from outside the current 40-man roster at some point in 2011, but trying to predict them is foolish at this time, imo., 96306=Wilson Ramos, has less than 100 Major League plate appearances and has all of one home run, four doubles and 5 RBIs to his name. Jesus Flores will most likely start in Syracuse. He missed all of last season and missed most of 2009 due to a severe injury.One could have said the same thing about the SF Giants last year. Buster Posey's very first in the majors I think? Ramos and Flores should provide plenty of depth for IRod as they finish their development. Its part and parcel of the turnover associated with prospects getting promoted to the 25? For that matter catcher shouldn't be any worst than 2nd, or SS? And might end up being better., 84782=The exciting thing about 2013 and beyond is that the Nats have the No. 6, No. 23 and No. 34 picks in this year's draft, which reportedly is heavy on top-flight college pitchers.Get another live arm to go with Strasburg, Zim and Cole, and the Nats might put on a show., 105352=This is how bright Phil Wood is in a piece on Nats320 published after the All Star break 2010:Phil Wood: But I think that J.D. Martin, and to a lesser extent, Craig Stammen, are back end of the rotation types. J.D. Martin at times looks brilliant. At times looks much less than that. And the same can be said for Stammen, who had a great start against The Braves and then stumbled the next couple of times out. There are times when they get two outs rather quickly and then they lose focus, start nibbling (around the plate), or whatever\u2013getting that 3rd out is a real challenge. But this is still a staff that is in flux and in transition. And I believe one year from today, we will be having a very different conversation about it.http://nats320.blogspot.com/2010/07/mid-season-thoughts-from-phil-wood.html, 86037=@Wally: True that. Building the support of a farm system is good, but providing a steady stream of real MLB-ready players can be another thing completely. Tampa has managed to do that so far, but KC, not so much imo. Washington (under Rizzo) has 'fleshed out' some weak spots in the minor-league system, and added some plus players (Werth, Ramos) to the 40-man via FA / trade. The question remains, can he continue to build on that, or will it collapse like a 'house of cards' in 2011? I'd personally hope for 72-75 wins from the Big Club in 2011, and a minor-league system with 2-3 playoff teams to show additional progress as well., 42904=Con't: Sorting the wheat from the chaff is what Spting Training is supposed to accomplish. Outside of a trade, I still think the Nationals go with Livo, Lannan, JZimm, Marquis & one of Gorzelanny/Maya/Detwiler/Broderick to begin 2011., 123601=@Mark'dYes, my projection for 2012 is based on who they have now in the system for Opening Day. I would expect a few callups after Super 2 in June 2012 like Bryce Harper and maybe Solis.Can we call next off-season, \"Hire me a Carpenter\" (not Bob Carpenter)., 135816=raymitten said\u2026 I'm not sure how much longer Lannan's gonna be around. Clearly Rizzo and most Nats fans are tired of watching the soft tossers who have passed through DC. To have Lannan at one time paraded as the #1 on the staff and some annointing him the \"Ace\" was laughable.When Lannan appeared in 2008 to be a #3 or #4 pitcher, he started regressing. Now the team is paying big money for him at $2.8 million and more the next 2 years. The team is also on the hook for $2 million to Maya. Here's Rizzo's problem for next year, most of his Opening Day starting rotation won't be back next year. Marquis and Livan Hernandez are gone most likely and Wang's contract expires. 2012 (I am projecting):1) Strasburg 2) Zimmermann3) Gorzelanny4) Lannan5) MayaSure, it looks a lot better in 2012 with Strasburg and then 2013 is where it gets interesting with Robbie Ray, Solis, AJ Cole.Then you have Baseball America's 2013 projection:No. 1 Starter Stephen Strasburg No. 2 Starter Jordan Zimmermann No. 3 Starter A.J. Cole No. 4 Starter Sammy Solis No. 5 Starter John Lannan That 2013 home built starting rotation looks real good and Lannan is projected as what he is at best a #5 on a good staff., 125428=@DFL said 11:38 a.m. One minor correction, Ross Detwiler was not acquired by trade. He was the #6 player drafted overall in the 2007 draft.I also can't agree that the draft of Detwiler has been \"successful,\" at least so far. You expect more out of the #6 pick than Detwiler's career 4.74 ERA, 1.58 WHIP, and 1.30 K/BB ratio, and 5.16 K/9. Sure, there's still lots of hope for Detwiler, given his injury history, but it's premature to call him \"successful.\", 29696=Think back to 2007/2008 and Acta teach and preach days\u2026.everyone was \"learning\" at the MLB level and yes\u2026.they did not learn or have any consequence for not learning\u2026.Speaking of Lastings (goofing off in Spring Training with his hat on backwards and Cedeno hitting him ball after ball that he let drop without moving 10 feet\u2026..laughing and laughing\u2026.how is that working out now Lastings?On the Minor League Level examples are many as well\u2026.Chris M still can not get his foot work down to take a simple throw at first. Mike Burgess was about the worst at no hitting cut off men when I watched him and Norris can to even get his glove raised and still to receive a pitch\u2026.not good and my question to Mark is who is responsible and taking ownership for these types of Player Development Failures at the MLB level and Farm?, 126383=Anon8 \u2013 The projection on your 2012 obviously isn't your optimum rotation given your comments on Lannan. Since Rizzo didn't get his top of the rotation guy this year I expect him to find him for next year.If Espi, Desmond and CF work out, Rizzo clearly has his top priority for 2012 \u2013 Chris Carpenter!, 18606=Player development is as important OR more important than drafting/scouting in my view.C'mon JayB you don't think Rizzo knows and BELIEVES this??? Look who Dayton Moore credits as his mentor? Someone working for the Nats right now named Roy Clark \u2026This isn't the JimBo Sideshow? We're not on the Simpson's anymore!From Crasnick's article:http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=crasnick_jerry&id=6057996Above all, development has become an organizational mantra under Moore, who broke in as an area scout with Atlanta in 1994 as a disciple of the highly respected Paul Snyder and Roy Clark. When he stresses the importance of the draft and observes that \"the most important parts of your organization are the area scouting supervisors and your minor league managers,'' he's not just paying lip service to building from within.Given how reluctant he usually is to advance anyone until he is certain they are ready? You don't think he knows this? Who got rid of Lastings Millege and look what he got for him? And where is Millege today? Unsigned., 49878=Just to further illustrate (and perhaps annoy) the strategy Rizzo and company appear to be pursing relative to starting pitching. Let's project the Chief's AAA starting rotation in 2011.POWER PITCHERS \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Ryan Tatusko RHSP | 93-94 as high as 97 for H'burg in 2010 helped get them to the playoffs.Bradley Peacock RHSP | 92-95 [h'burg -> Syracuse] ranked prospect.Jimmy Barthmaier RHSP | 91.6 in 2009.

Livan DOES deserve our respect. And the opening day ball.All true, but after that its probably time for a transition to the bullpen for Livo. Its not 2005 and he isn't with the Florida Marlins anymore. If he pitches like an all star again he keeps his slot \u2026 if not he has to know he will be replaced in the rotation. Most projections show him continuing his decline \u2026, 41142=We all know that Livan can't throw hard and has had some bad years but these two stat lines are from last year. One is Livan\u202612-9 GS 28 IP 212 ERA 3.1810-12 GS 33 IP 211 ERA 3.66\u2026 the other one is Cliff Lee.I'm not saying Livan is equivalent to Cliff Lee. I'm saying Livan he deserves our respect. He gets more out of his remaining skills than most pitchers do., 55771=Just to reinforce how important velocity and \"nasty stuff\" in for pitchers especially starters, and the players know it makes a difference:Sue Dinem:but was hit hard in his first pro season in \u201909 asfatigue set in from trying to pitch at the 91-94 range after throwing 88-92 the year before. Scouts noted the uptick in velocity was at the expense of movement. In 2010, Holder reset the pitch and regained both its sink and his confidence.Looks from here like its up to one or more of the top five guys listed after Strasburg to make or break the 2011 season. After this season the chafe gets separated from the wheat with a new crop of starting pitchers steadily progressing toward the majors. And they know that as well., 110055=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/baseball/mlb/01/27/indians-sizemore.ap/index.html?eref=twitter_feedI read this Grady Sizemore post on MLBTradeRumors originated from none other than the know-it-all Phil Wood of MASN.Now I guess he is wiping egg on his face as I heard Rizzo denied it and a more vocal denial from Cleveland:New general manager Chris Antonetti refuted trade rumors involving Sizemore, a three-time All-Star, during a meeting with fans Thursday night in a town hall setting in downtown Cleveland.\"I don't comment on individual players, but in this instance I will say we have had absolutely no discussions with any team regarding Grady,\" Antonetti said. \"His rehab has gone as well as can be expected. He's already in our training camp in Goodyear, [Ariz.], doing baseball-related activities. It is hopeful he will be in spring training games by mid-March.\", 158436=Ops\u2026thanks Mark\u2026wonder what the hold up is on Tom G. contract is\u2026..All GM's make mistakes but Jimbo made them more than almost any GM ever and Rizzo\u2026.well we shall see\u2026if this team does not win soon he too will be looking in from the outside. It is all about winning games\u2026something the Nats have not done since 2005, 45317=The Nationals will still need 9-10 SP's to get through the 2011 season, at the very least, imo. JZimm will likely be shut down at 150+IP, as will Detwiler, Wang & Mock. Gorzelanny might get 160-170IP, along with Atilano, Chico, & Martis (if they stay).There will undoubtably be callups from outside the current 40-man roster at some point in 2011, but trying to predict them is foolish at this time, imo.@BinM, YOU CAN'T HAVE LIVO AT THE TOP OF YOUR STAFF AGAIN and expect to make it EVEN CLSE TO .500. That IMHO is completely and utterly ludicrous and apparently goes against every stat and projection mechanism. Even on fangraphs they speak to having \"power pitchers\" at the top. This team IS NOT the 2008 Jim Bowden crew? It can and really should do better.In other words why are you putting Livo up top? Given he has the second slowest fastball of starters in the majors? Last year he was veteran insurance policy and innings eaters. Yes, he was needed. But this year too?Of course you aren't the only one. Why then does Rizzo put Jordan Zimmermann at the top of his rotation? While you and Riggleman put him at the bottom? Possibly because the guy will be innings limited and has never pitched 200 as you so aptly pointed out, as should Detiwler and Mock. Gorzelanny (he won't be in the bullpen for the Nats that's for damned sure.) I don't care what Bill James says it won't happen. Not with a lefty of his caliber and the Nats needing starting pitching at the top. After that Lanan? Perhaps Maya but the time has arrived to ease Livo out and back into the innings eater / bullpen emergency start role. Just as they are easing Pudge out, so should they with Livo. Unless a dire emergency again occurs and they must trot him out to the rescue again., 60799=The team has to find a way to at least draw even with the Marlins this year; They've owned the Nationals since 2006. Should they do that, the W-L record will improve by another 4-5 games at least. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013The draft is quite a ways off; I'd hope that the FO simply goes after the best player available in each round. Seeing the Lerners' willingness to spend over the last two years, bringing another 25-30 picks into the Nats' system should be possible., 22311=Justin Duscherer did close for a bit in 2005 and 2006. If we pick him up, is he competing for a bullpen spot or a rotation spot?I would think his priorities are, in order: \u2013 Guaranteed contract \u2013 Ability to earn a spot in the rotation \u2013 Playing for a good teamI'm just guessing that we do not get him, that he signs with Baltimore, seeing a better chance to join the rotation., 91926=But it really doesn't matter if it looks better, it has to start being better or he will be deemed to have failed.Good article about a franchise that actually finished worst than the Nats last year. This franchise just traded their #1 top-of-the-rotation starter because their farm system is now bursting with talented arms. And at other positions as well. Along with the rays this team should be consistently competitive for the next decade or two. This rebuilding process started in 2006. The GM had a lot more to work with than Rizzo did when he started. And what's interesting is that he did not have all that many top draft picks \u2026Don't have to be a member to read \u2026http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=crasnick_jerry&id=6057996 As JayB says, Rizzo has five years. If Dayton Moore (a Roy Clark disciple) can do it in five, I am betting Rizzo gets it done in 3-4., 102034=I am little worried about Espy too, especially this year as he gets over the hamate injury. Still seems like our back up plan should have been better than a prolonged stint for Jerry H.Anyhow, on the original post re: Rizzo, I think a GM should get graded on his talent acquisition/appraisal skills, and there needs to be a few years of history before we can accurately (or fairly) judge. It doesn't matter where he chooses to apply himself \u2013 draft, big ticket FAs, scrap heap FAs, international FAs. He needs to bring in players who produce, and those who don't, get canned. That sounds simplistic, I know, but it really isn't. #1 draft picks don't always work out \u2013 think Tim Beckham. The only reason that Friedman gets a pass on not taking Posey is because he has a laundry list of guys who have panned out, or look like they are going to. So success rate matters, I guess. Omar the Infamous got canned in NY because he didn't bring in enough quality guys \u2013 O.Perez, for example. Sabean isn't being raked over the coals for Zito and Rowand contracts because he found value in Anres Torres and Huff \u2013 he found players to produce, so he isn't being fired over spending money poorly. I think that is how they all get graded, in the end.So Rizzo should get another year or two before being completely judged, but I think early returns are positive. I agree with an earlier poster that this roster looks better than before, and the farm system also looks better. But it really doesn't matter if it looks better, it has to start being better or he will be deemed to have failed., 42046=peric: Don't get so amped up over a single post. Just because I list Livo first in a queue of eight or nine names doesn't mean I (or anyone else, for that matter) have pronounced him as the #1SP for the Nationals in 2011. Again, that's part of what Spring Training is for., 20441=ESPN reporting the Mets will host the 2013 All Star game so the Nats can hope for 2015 now.An All Star game in Washington in 2013 would have yielded huge dividends for the team and the region.}",
