The management table can be anything such as an aggregate of files or pointers, a database, or binary data set. In the description referenced to FIG. 4, the management table for failover node determination is indicated while attention is paid to failover processing load reduction depending on the difference in the employed data transfer method. In FIG. 5, therefore, the information indicating a remote copy type is used as an element of the management table. In a situation where the next high-priority node, that is, the next active node is to be determined in accordance with the storage system performance, however, the management table may be created by extracting the storage system performance information from the configuration information.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{75594=3. Information indicating that data is remote-copied relative to storage system C 1022 by the asynchronous transfer method., 90228=The new highest-priority node 1311 issues an instruction to storage system B 1021 for forming a remote copy pair based on the synchronous transfer method, for which storage system B 1021 serves as a copy source, between storage system B 1021 and storage system A 1020. Further, the new highest-priority node 1311 issues an instruction for forming a remote copy pair based on the asynchronous transfer method, for which storage system B 1021 serves as a copy source, between storage system B 1021 and storage system A 1020 (step 1626). Next, node 1311 renders the resources of storage system 1321 on-line in accordance with the new management table information and configuration information (step 1627). Node 1311 is now in the same state as node 1310 when the latter node served as the highest-priority node before failover (step 1628). As regards the operation to be performed between nodes 1310 and 1311, which originally performed synchronous copy operations, data consistency is achieved between their subordinate storage systems. Therefore, the operation to be performed between these nodes can be started immediately after failover simply by changing the synchronous copy direction. As regards the operation to be performed between the former high-priority node and standby node, which originally performed asynchronous copy operations, it is necessary to assure data consistency after failover. The necessity for data consistency assurance will now be described., 96805=The method for copying untransferred data \u03b1, which is still not transferred from storage system A 1020 to storage system C 1022, to storage system C 1022 via storage system B 1021 has been described. However, an alternative method may be used so as to transfer untransferred data \u03b1 directly from storage system A 1020 to storage system C 1022., 91856=As described earlier, the new highest-priority node 1311 issues an instruction to storage system B 1021 for performing a remote copy based on the synchronous transfer method, for which storage system B 1021 serves as a copy source, from storage system B 1021 to storage system A 1020. Further, the new highest-priority node 1311 issues an instruction to storage system B 1021 for performing a remote copy based on the asynchronous transfer method, for which storage system B 1021 serves as a copy source, from storage system B 1021 to storage system C 1022. However, the data retained by storage system C 1022, which so far performed an asynchronous copy to storage system A 1020, is not always up to date. In other words, it is possible that some data in storage system A 1020 may not be copied to storage system C 1022 (the data left uncopied in this manner is hereinafter referred to as untransferred data). More specifically, storage system C 1022 is not up to date, and storage system A 1020 might have untransferred data of storage system C 1022., 65933=Storage system A 1020, storage system B 1021, and storage system C 1022 each have configuration information 1090 and a hard disk drive 1050 for data storage. The configuration information 1090 is stored in a memory within each storage system. Each storage system processes a data read instruction or data write instruction received from a higher-level device while referencing the configuration information. The configuration information includes the information indicating what hard disk is connected, the information about a logical volume which is logically formed on a hard disk, and the information necessary for a remote data copy operation relative to another storage system. The configuration information also includes pairing information, which indicates what logical volume of a storage system is to be copied to what logical volume on what storage system. Further, the stored configuration information includes the information indicating whether the remote copy operation to be performed is based on the synchronous method or asynchronous method. Storage system A 1020, storage system B 1021, and storage system C 1022 are connected respectively via networks 1040, 1041, and 1042. For these connections, SANs (Storage Area Networks) or other networks may be used., 42113=The difference between the two methods will now be described. When performing a remote copy operation 1200 based on the synchronous transfer method, storage system A copies the data written in storage system A 1020 at a remote copy source to storage system B 1021 at a remote copy destination synchronously relative to a write instruction of node A 1010, which is a host computer. Therefore, the storage systems usually retain the same data. When performing a remote copy operation 1201 based on the asynchronous transfer method, a storage system copies the data written in storage system C 1022 at a remote copy source to storage system D 1023 at a remote copy destination asynchronously relative to a write instruction from node C 1013, which is a host computer. In other words, storage system C 1022 transfers data designated by a write request from node C 1013 to storage system D 1023, which is a remote copy destination, after issuing a notification of completion of a data write to node C 1013. The above data transfer operation is performed according to a task schedule unique to storage system C 1022. Therefore, storage system D 1023 at the remote copy destination retains old data for a longer period of time than the remote copy source. However, a data write completion notification is transmitted to node C 1013 without waiting for the process for data transfer to storage system D 1023 at the remote copy destination. As a result, node C 1013 can immediately proceed to the next process (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,554,347)., 89079=Next, each node checks whether it is to operate as the new highest-priority node (steps 1623 and 1633). The above check can be completed by judging whether the IP address of the local node agrees with that of the next active node. If the management table 1080 stores the information about a machine name instead of an IP address, the machine names of the nodes must be checked. If the above process concludes that the second-highest-priority node 1311 is the next active node, the flag in the highest-priority node operation flag column in the management table within the second-highest-priority node is changed from \u201c1\u201d to \u201c0\u201d with the flag in the next-highest-priority node operation flag column changed from \u201c0\u201d to \u201c1\u201d (step 1624). The second-highest-priority node now becomes the highest-priority node. The previous standby node 1312 now becomes the second-highest-priority node. Node 1311, which is now the highest-priority node, copies a new management table 1080 to the standby node 1312 via the communication line 1030 (step 1625)., 40750=When, in a remote copy operation 1200 based on the synchronous transfer method, storage system A 1020 receives a write instruction for data from node A 1010 ((1)), it issues a write instruction for the same data to storage system B 1021 ((2)). When the data is completely written into storage system B 1021, a completion notification is transmitted to storage system A 1020 ((3)), and a write completion notification is issued to node A 1010 ((4)). In this instance, an update is performed while the data retained by storage system A 1020, which is connected to node A, is kept identical with the data retained by storage system B 1021. This manner of remote copy operation is referred to as a synchronous remote copy operation. On the other hand, when, in a remote copy operation 1201 based on the asynchronous transfer method, storage system C 1022 receives a write instruction for data from node C 1013, it issues a write completion instruction for the same data to node C 1013 ((2)). Storage system C 1022 issues a write instruction to storage system D 1023 asynchronously relative to a process requested by node C 1013, and receives a write completion notification ((4))., 95965=When the above method is used, node 1311 is prevented from writing the data written in storage system B 1021 into storage system C 1022 before untransferred data \u03b1 is completely written into storage system C 1022. If data written in compliance with a write instruction from node 1311 is to be overwritten by untransferred data \u03b1, which is delivered to storage system B 1021 from storage system A 1020, only the latest data will be transmitted to storage system C 1022. Therefore, the amount of data transfer from storage system B 1021 to storage system C 1022 may be reduced by refraining from writing into storage system C 1022 the data that is received from storage system A 1020 but overwritten and rendered unnecessary., 75757=Upon receipt of a configuration information request from a node, a storage system passes the above-mentioned configuration information 1090, which includes the information about a data transfer type, to the node that issued the request. The configuration information about a storage system can be acquired by a node when the node transmits SCSI mode selection command VendorUnique or the like to the storage system. After receipt of the configuration information, the highest-priority node 1310 gathers necessary items of information from the configuration information 1090 to create the management table 1450 (step 1412)., 67324=Bidirectional remote copy operations can be performed between network-connected storage systems. Various remote copy methods are selectable. The present embodiment assumes that the synchronous transfer method is set for performing a remote copy from storage system A 1020 to storage system B 1021, and that the asynchronous transfer method is set for performing a remote copy from storage system A 1020 to storage system C 1022., 76447=An example of the management table is represented by a remote copy status management table 1450 (hereinafter referred to as the management table as appropriate). The management table 1450 presented as an example has three elements: node type for node identification, remote copy type for data transfer method identification, and operation flag for indicating whether the connection to the currently active node is established. The stored node type information indicates an IP address, computer name, or other element identifying a computer serving as a node. The remote copy type information indicates what transfer method (type) is used for a remote copy operation relative to a storage system connected to the highest-priority node. If, for instance, IP0001 represents the highest-priority node, the storage system connected to it is a remote copy source. Therefore, the information in its remote copy type column indicates a remote copy source. A field one position down indicates that the data transfer between IP0002 and IP0001 is based on the synchronous transfer method. A field two positions down indicates that the data transfer between IP0003 and IP0001 is based on the asynchronous transfer method. The operation flag indicates which node is active. In the management table shown in the figure, the number \u201c1\u201d represents the active node. Under normal conditions, the operation flag column for the node connected to a storage system serving as a remote copy source reads \u201c1\u201d., 100447=For storage system C 1022, too, it is understood that the remote copy destination and source for new remote copy operations will be defined in accordance with an instruction from the newly selected priority node. Further, as described earlier, storage system C 1022 is subjected upon the start of operation to task management over data that has not been asynchronously remote-copied before failover so that the data to be stored is received in advance., 36345=This application relates to and claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2003-183743, filed on Jun. 27, 2003, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference., 94550=After being requested to present the information about untransferred data, storage system A 1020 returns the total block count N, which represents the total number of untransferred local data blocks, to storage system B 1021 as a response. Upon receipt of untransferred data \u03b1, storage system B 1021 checks whether the block count N within untransferred data \u03b1 remains to be a positive value. If the block count N is positive, storage system B 1021 concludes that storage system A 1020 retains one or more untransferred data blocks. Untransferred data \u03b1, which is equivalent in size to N blocks, is then transferred to storage system B 1021. For storage system C 1022, storage system B 1021 sets an asynchronous data transfer method in which storage system B serves as a copy source, and then sequentially copies untransferred data \u03b1, which is received from storage system A 1020, to storage system C 1022. If a write instruction for storage system B 1021 arrives from the new highest-priority node 1311 before untransferred data \u03b1 is completely copied from storage system B 2021 to storage system C 1022, storage system B 1021 forms a task schedule so that the data designated by the write instruction will be copied to storage system C 1022 after untransferred data \u03b1., 65035=The main data center 1001 comprises node A 1010 and storage system A 1020. In like manner, sub data centers 1002 and 1003 each comprise a node and a storage system connected to that node. Each node is a personal computer, workstation, or other device that may function as a host computer. Node 1010, node 1011, and node 1012 each have software 1060 for providing a cluster service and a management table 1080. These nodes are interconnected via a network 1030 such as a TCP/IP-based network. The data center systems are controlled by computer readable medium containing code for causing operations as described herein. Those skilled in the art will understand that the code comprises computer readable program embodied in a computer usable medium for execution by the data center systems., 97223=An example of the above data transfer method will now be described. If a failover switch to node 1311 occurs due, for instance, to a failure occurrence in node 1310, storage system B 1021 uses an untransferred data request command based on a vendor unique SCSI command to determine the block count N of untransferred data \u03b1 that is retained by storage system A 1020. If the block count N remains to be a positive value, the block count N value is periodically confirmed and a write into storage system C 1022 is blocked until the block count N reaches 0 (zero) even if node 1311 issues a write instruction relative to storage system B 1021. (The asynchronous remote copy operation is interrupted so that the copy operation for data consistency takes precedence.) When storage system B 1021 verifies that the block count N is 0 (zero), it permits storage system C 1022 to be written into, and starts a remote copy operation., 93060=The new highest-priority node 1311 then instructs its subordinate storage system B 1021 to \u201cissue an instruction for requesting the information about untransferred data retained by storage system A 1020\u201d. Upon receipt of the above instruction, storage system B 1021 issues, for instance, an untransferred data information request command, which is based on a vendor unique SCSI command, to storage system A 1020 to request the information about untransferred data. Upon receipt of the above request from storage system B 1021, storage system A 1020 transmits the information about untransferred data to storage system B 1021., 75432=2. Information indicating that data is remote-copied relative to storage system B 1021 by the synchronous transfer method., 75257=1. Information indicating that storage system A 1020 is a remote copy source (a storage system connected to the highest-priority node)., 83598=When the IP address of the second-highest-priority node is found, the \u201chighest-priority node\u201d\u2014indicating flag in the operation flag column of the management table 1080 possessed by the highest-priority node 1010 is lowered and a flag is raised in the operation flag column for the IP address of a newly selected node to indicate that it is now active (step 1515). The management table updated in this manner is then transmitted via the communication line 1030 to the other nodes within the data center system in order to update the management tables owned by the other nodes as well (step 1516).}",
