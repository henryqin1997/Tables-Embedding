Clean, beautiful, awesome view. We stayed July 14 - 17. My best friend, myself and 4 4 kids stayed here. The kids are adult size, sons are 13, 14 both 6,2\". We were still very comfortable. It is family oriented. Price was great, staff very friendly and helpful. I would stay here again and I would recommend this place to family and friends. The only thing to warn about is bring a hair dryer. But",
