            "The safety on Ward Island is phenomenal because we have so many campus cops, that do an excellent job. They are very nice and considerate.",
            "There is a lot of clubs and activities which I am sure anyone can find their place in one.",
            "Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi has a bunch of fun things to do, there is multiple clubs you can join, as well as the beach. Now that it is getting warmer you can go swimming or kayaking in the ocean when the tides are down. Or you can go downtown and walk the beach line.",
            "Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi has a couple of fast food restaurants on campus which are very good, including Subway, and Chick-fil-a. They also have a Starbucks right my the library which is awesome!",
            "I am currently living on campus in one of their many apartments. I am sharing my apartment with 3 other ladies. Everything is excellent, but there is a constant bug problem as well as pricey, which is why I took off a star.",
            "The academic rigor is influentially, and very helpful on teaching us students to use our brains on complex, and contentious concepts.",
            "The tips I would give for prospective students is to show up to class no matter what. Always read the chapters. Pay close attention to your professors because they will help you.",
            "Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi is an excellent college because they offer so much help to the students. They help you with anything like academic problems, health problems, and general advice. It really is a great school to intend because of it being a smaller school, with all the great professors, and advisers."

The campus has grown so much and is still building and recruiting like crazy for new students! Don't be fooled by the beach, this school is for serious students who work hard., 113164=Not Much Going On Here Just Volleyball & Basketball (Though There Is Golf, Softball, Baseball, But NO Football) In Classes Just Follow The Syllabus Each Teacher Gives You, It Will Surely Come In Handy! Make Sure To Check It Ahead Of Time For Future Assignments & Deadlines. Most Classes Have Online Assignments So Have A Computer If Not You Can Do It In The Library Or Various Computer Labs Around Campus. When It Comes To Books RENT Them! I Would Say Take A Triad Even Though You May Not Want To The Seminar Classes Are Only 1 Credit Hour But Come In Handy Helping Out With Your Classes Connected To It & Making Friends., 493317=Make sure if you are a freshman applying for scholarships that you do it the March before you get in! I applied late so I wasn't eligible, don't follow in my footsteps!, 26488=There are several things I would recommend to a new student or someone who is planning on attending TAMUCC. 1. Always accept your awards through your S.A.I.L account. It may appear as though you've been awarded your tuition, but make sure that you hit the accept button or the awards will disappear after two weeks, and it is very hard to get them back. (If you were under the Islander Guarantee, you will probably have to take out loans at this point.) Just make sure you accept your awards! 2. I would recommend buying your textbooks from an online source. Do some research and figure out where you will get them at the cheapest price. The campus book store is wonderful for souveniers/ college gear, but the price of the textbooks will not be very discounted. I would recommend getting USED textbooks because they are always cheaper. 3. Live on campus for your freshman year, or while you are adjusting to the college life or even just the campus. The rent is a little high, but you get free internet, phone, cable TV, and all other bills are paid. Living off campus can become more expensive if you have to pay bills! The Camden Miramar housing is wonderful and a very short distance from your classes., 161076=Keep up with your work and study. It depends on your teacher of course how hard the courses are but just work at it and have fun and it will be a great experience. Also go to the gym there, it's really great and i think you will really like it. And participate in extracurricular activities, there is always something going on, like basketball for example, it's all year from august to march, it's like other schools football team, lots get involved in that!, 8356=Visit the campus. Learn about the different clubs you can join. Check out the program they offer for your major. I know this is an excellent place to get an Education degree and a Nursing degree. [Our brand new nursing building is opening sometimes in 2010 I think! And we have a college of business building on the way.] But visit once, visit twice. Look around the town and get to know it. Make sure you want to be here and don't settle on just any college., 424419=Living on campus may or may not be the best choice for you. Research apartments and living areas around the school. A large majority commute from nearby rather than live on campus. I've done both and found Camden Miramar to be kind of old and disgusting when it comes to cleanliness! Also, research the website and find your instructor and syllabus online from previous semesters. It will help you get a head start on classes. Another tip is AVOID the bookstore! The bookstore is nice but everything is overpriced. Buy or rent your textbooks online through Amazon or another reputable source rather than the bookstore and don't be afraid to get older editions of the same book. Most professors in the psychology and nursing departments go off of lecture notes or NCLEX test preparation books. If you are applying to their nursing program or have just been accepted, I STRONGLY suggest you research the HESI exams. In some classes, your scores on these tests will compromise up to 80% of your course grade. They are administered from an outside source, not the professor so information is general and lectures typically don't cover the material that is on them. You need NCLEX review books and study materials to fill the gaps. Also, enjoy your time here and don't be afraid to explore the island! There are a lot of little study spaces and corners you can lay your books out and read. I loved it there while I was attending., 358516=The clubs and activities are very active on our campus. There is always something going on on the UC lawn or at Camden Miramar the company in charge of the apartments and dorms on campus., 560204=Camden Miramar was always a go-to if you didn't own a car. Off-Campus Housing is cheap if you have multiple roommates but less privacy usually drives some people other directions., 83019=Extremely safe. We have actual police officers on campus, not just security guards, and they're on campus 24 hours a day 365 days a year. They're in cars, on bikes, in the library, all for your safety. I've always felt safe walking to my car at night. They have little poles everywhere that you can push a button if you feel unsafe for some reason, after 10:30 nobody can come into the resident halls/apartments without the campus ID card (sanddollar), also nobody can even get in to the dorm buildings without a sanddollar linked to that building. Super super safe. :), 84941=Our homecoming is in February, since we don't have football. Theres a statue of Hector P. Garcia in a plaza named after him on campus and for good luck every semester during finals you can touch his foot lol!, 437900=The dorms are HUGE! The dorms are Camden Miramar apartments, so the cost is a little pricey compared to other school's housing, but it comes with ALL utilities paid for (water, electricity, internet connection, etc...). Not only that, but it includes laundry machines for no cost. You want to apply for the school first as quickly as you can so you can apply for housing., 545060=During Homecoming week we have the Lighting of the I which is where all the students come out and watch as our head dean torches the giant I that we all take pride in. We also have a zombie game that goes on for two weeks during October for some Halloween spirit, and some people get really into it tackling their friends from across the lawns. There is also the tunnel of oppression that the Islander Culture Association plans every year to educate and get people involved with tragic events that happen every day across the globe. The Garcia Plaza is a place where anyone can take the stage and say what they feel. Its kind of like a free speech zone.There are also people that go up there to sing karaoke or to play an instrument. People also play human chess there because the stage is part human chess board. Its pretty stellar. Our dining hall also celebrates a different part of the world. We have visited New York, Japan and India through the culture of food.This was the first year the hall was open so there are more countries to come!, 470444=A dining hall is being built that will open in 2014 so that will be awesome but I personally like the stuff they already have., 87515=I lived on campus my first semester, in their residential halls, which are simply dorms. They also have apartments on campus, if that interests yu. They're very nice, because you don't share a community bathroom.. you share it with one other person, at most. I had my own room, and so did my roommate, and our rooms were connected by a bathroom. We just shared a shower and toilet. We had our own personal sinks (which had a TON of counter space). I think its a GREAT thing to live on campus your first year, because you can adjust to college easier by not having to find parking and just walking to class. Also, there's a washer/dryer and kitchen on every floor of your dorm building. Nobody ever really uses the kitchens, and they are cleaned daily (minus weekends) so you can cook meals in there! Camden Miramar, who owns the dorms/apartments on campus, has all sorts of events so they make living on campus fun! I would rate all 5 stars, but my dorm room had a couple of minor problems and it was pretty expensive., 564116=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 20108=I did not know what to expect coming down here and now that I am here, I don't want to leave! I absolutely love all the different things they have to offer here. Since August I have become a part of a sorority and other organizations as well and they are all so beneficial to my personal skills. I love being able to study in the library while gazing at the beach simultaneously. It is a very relaxed environment here and the people are amazing. It is not a huge campus like UT or anything, but it is big enough to where I see new faces everyday. It is nice being here on the beach! We have our own little beach for the students which is really nice in the warm weather. As for the colder days however, there is not a whole lot to do., 362480=This University is a really good one. They have a lot of people willing to help you make it through your college experience especially during your freshman year. They have great professors that are willing to help you learn the material better if you are willing to put the effort in. The sports and spirit at the school is great as well. There are so many opportunities for people to join in and get to know others. Camden Miramar also helps with giving opportunities to meet new people and have a wonderful college experience.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Anyone looking into an Education degree [my major]- At TAMUCC they work to get you into the classrooms and student teaching asap. Most of the Junior and Senior Year are observing and Student teaching at the Early Childhood Development Center on campus. This is basically a lottery school that has Pre-K 3, Pre-K 4, Kinder and 1st through 6th grades. They even offer work-study jobs there [I am doing that as well and it is definitely amazing.] Nursing students- I hear we have a very good nursing program here, with the new building just about ready to open and everything. Anyone that loves the beach- the view of the bay is just beautiful. I love studying in the library and being able to look out and see the water. There is a place for just about anyone here. It is really easy to get involved and the people are really nice. I highly suggest it. Tips for prospective students Visit the campus. Learn about the different clubs you can join. Check out the program they offer for your major. I know this is an excellent place to get an Education degree and a Nursing degree.
