Proud to be a Blue Hen!, 426449=Starting with the class of 2016, there is a candlelight ceremony for the freshmen on South Green initiating their college experience., 230758=New d-hall coming 2015. It is supposed to be largest on East Coast!!!!!!, 571379=there are a BILLION different clubs- go to Activities night during 1743 days and use stUDent Central to find others., 215291=There are so many different clubs and activities on campus. There is no reason to spend all of your free time sitting in your dorm. During 1743 Welcome Weekend, there will be events where student organizations and clubs set up tables in the student centers, and freshman can walk through, ask questions, and sign up to join clubs. There's a club for everything. Everything., 615935=Being from Delaware, University of Delaware (UD) was the last school I was interested in attending because like so many others I wanted an out-of-state adventure. But upon starting at UD in the fall of 2013, I not only fully embrace my new hometown university but also cringed at the idea of experiencing college at any other academic institution. The University of Delaware has stolen my heart with its beautiful campus, excellent professors and various study abroad options, and the amazing extracurricular/greek/social options., 376108=Most of the dorms are nearly new and very nice inside! There are a few old dorms that are currently being remodeled and should be finished by the summer of 2013., 563635=In 2015, almost all the freshman dorms will be very new, but it honestly doesn't matter where you live on campus because everyone loves their dorm. I'm a freshman and I live in one of the oldest dorms on campus and I wouldn't trade it for the world. I love it. Wherever you live on campus, students are guaranteed a great time., 624246=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 229774=1743 days Kirkbride jesus Grottos, 547470=Like most universities, the University of Delaware has it's share of unusual things around campus. One of these would be the Techno Bus Driver. If you ever ride the bus around campus there is a chance that you could ride of his bus. Another unusual thing at the University would be Kirkbride Jesus. This guy stands right outside Kirkbride lecture hall and preaches the word of God every Wednesday at 1:00 p.m. Many enjoy siting and listening to him as well as the people just walking by. There are many others, but to know them you will have to become a Blue Hen to find out!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here The campus is beautiful, everyone is friendly, the staff and faculty are so helpful, the food's really pretty good, school spirit abounds. Literally every day I think of how lucky I am to be going to such a great school and studying in such a fantastic music department around such talented and encouraging Professors AND peers. Am learning a lot I'm a Music Education major here, and not only am I already finding myself improving (not even two months into classes!) with my piano and vocal studies, but my General Education classes are teaching me a great deal. I like that there is a large amount of breadth requirements for all majors. Although it is stressful at times, it allows for a well-rounded, exciting education. My Professors all love what they teach, and many are published experts in their field, making their knowledge that much more valuable.
