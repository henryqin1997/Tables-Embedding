Producer Information From the tip of Chablis to the toe of Beaujolais, from regional, village, 1er Cru and Grand Cru wines Louis Jadot produces Burgundy and nothing but Burgundy. The familiar Bacchus head label has become the reliable stamp of quality and consistency from what can often be a confusing region. Louis Henry Denis Jadot founded the business in 1859. His vision was to build a business with a high quality reputation. One of his key aims, as well as to make top wines, was to build a significant vineyard base. This vision remains core to the business today. Over time, prestigious acquisitions have included Beaune Clos des Ursules, Chevalier Montrachet Les Demoiselles , the Clair Dau Estate with vineyards in Bonnes Mares, Chambertin Clos de Beze, Musigny and Gevrey Chambertin Clos St Jacques. Plus the picturesque Santenay Clos de Malte and Premier Cru holdings in",
