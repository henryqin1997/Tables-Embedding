            "The campus at ABAC is very safe and has its own personal police force patrolling the campus at almost all times.",
            "ABAC is the perfect school for anyone interested in agricultural, farming, or animals, but can still be a great school for students who have no interest in these things at all.",
            "The tuition at Abraham Baldwin is pretty reasonable and considering how beautiful the school is and how helpful and supportive the faculty and staff is, you definitely get more bang for your buck at ABAC.",
            "Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College is located in Tifton, which is a rather small south Georgia town whose heart is planted at the intersection of Highway 82 and Interstate 75. At first glance, there doesn't seem to be much to do in Tifton for fun, but it just takes some imagination. ABAC hosts rodeos, musical events, sporting events, etc. that will keep many students busy for the most part. ABAC students also enjoy fishing, hunting, atvs, riding around, going to the bars downtown, and the list goes on. No matter how boring Tifton may seem at first, you can almost always come up with something fun to do.",
            "ABAC offers a few different options whenever it comes to food and dining. A Pizza Hut is located on campus and the dining hall serves a wide range of foods; it has also been rumored that we are also getting a StarBucks on campus too.",
            "I have never personally lived in the dorms, but I know people who have. Lakeside seems to be the dorms that most people have a problem with because they are small and older. On the other hand, the dorms at ABAC Place are really nice and look just like any upper-scale apartment complex.",
            "ABAC is known for being harder than many other academic institutions, but as long as you study and ask for help whenever you need it, you will be just fine.",
            "Study hard and have a plan for what you want to do with your life.",
            "Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College not only offers its students the opportunity to learn on a beautiful historic campus, but the college also offers a diverse range of degree programs in which almost anyone can receive a high quality education. In my experience, ABAC's teaching staff has always been extremely helpful and kind; giving us students the support we need to achieve our academic goals. I would highly recommend Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College to anyone looking for a great place to start their college career."
