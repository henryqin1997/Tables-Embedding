            "Campus safety depends on where you are and at what time. This campus strongly advises girls to never walk alone. There happens to be a high crime rate on campus but it is being dealt with. I personally have never felt unsafe while walking alone at night but there are points where I can see it to be an issue",
            "There is always clubs and school activities to attend! Just keep involved and in the know about events.",
            "Any type of student! The UO doesn't cater to just one type of student. There is all walks of life here and the acceptance of peoples differences is amazing. But if you hate the rain, this is not a place for you",
            "Out of most of the schools I visited, UO gives me the most for my money. I am able to get all the classes I need to graduate, visit with advisors, seek teachers aid and various other support that the school offers. Many of my friends struggle with these aspects at their schools but I find the service to be well worth it!",
            "Football games are the top thing to do at UO. We are most known for our football team but other sporting teams provide just as much fun and entertainment! Getting out for a hike with a group of friends is also a must! Eugene offers so many beautiful sights and the downtown area is fun to venture to. Saturday market is always my favorite.",
            "UO offers a wide variety of choices which fits most needs of students lifestyles. I was able to find enough vegetarian/vegan options which was very important in choosing a school to live on-campus. Its hard to get bored of the food because there is pasta bars, deli-style salad bars, sandwich bars, sushi, salads, and a huge buffet that changes its menu every day!",
            "I didn't enjoy dorm life too much. As a transfer student, it is quite difficult to find your circle of friend while being in an environment that is much younger than you. The freshman on my floor however, loved it. Its a great way to meet people, connect and feel like you are apart of a community.",
            "UO course load varies between teachers but overall it is doable if you put enough time aside to study and put your utmost effort into it. There is a lot of help available from teachers office hours, tutorial hours or GTF office hours. If you put in time, it will pay off.",
            "Get involved when you start! Greek life is a great way to expand your horizons on finding your own friend group. Also team or club sports, on-campus jobs, study groups as well as clubs in general. There are various amounts of community service opportunities and ways to get active with others!",
            "UO is not just a beautiful campus, it is a campus filled with friendships, compassion and acceptance. The teachers are all willing to help and offer numerous amounts of help sessions, all staff are kind and the students are just as friendly. The sports teams are amazing and there is never a dull moment!"

Whatever type of student you are, you will be able to find others like you at U of O., 410761=I toured the campus this summer during July, and absolutely fell IN LOVE with this school. The school spirit, the excessive friendliness emanating from people on every corner, how much there was to do and get involved in and the academic rigor they portrayed. Also, the campus is absolutely beautiful, and there seems like something to do for everyone, and there's no one specific stereotype at the U of O., 53173=Get your FAFSA in on time and if you are coming from a different state make sure you get it in by March 1st. My state gave me a different date and my mom is now working double time to pay for my education on her own.}",

The education is terrific, the people are awesome and the school spirit is unbelievable and so exciting. Tips for prospective students Go see the school and talk to some of the students. Be prepared for rain, but it's no big deal. Consider a bike with fenders. Bang for the buck",
