            "All the faculty and staff, even the students, care about campus safety. There is so much security you can feel safe anywhere you are on campus. The school sends out warnings and safety notices that keeps you updated on things that are occurring on or near campus.",
            "There is one street that contains many of the sororities and fraternities and some of them are good and some are not. You just have to look carefully and be smart about them.",
            "There are so many clubs and activities that it is guaranteed that not one week is boring. Sometimes events overlap and it can be very hard to choose because they are all extremely fun and you get to make new friends in each.",
            "This is a great school for kids who know how to control themselves. For kids who do not give easily into temptations because i won't lie there are temptations. You have to have your priorities straight and follow through to them.",
            "There is actually a creek that runs through the middle of campus and so whenever you are at one end you must cross a bridge to get to the other side. No matter the weather the creek is always beautiful and its just amazing to see. It still gets me every time.",
            "You have to manage your money well because no one else manages it for you and though Chico State is kind of expensive, its worth it.",
            "There are many activities that you can do for fun and some even benefit the community. You can go to the WREC which has an indoor track and an indoor pool as well as an outside pool. you can go to any event going on that night or you can do some good and apply for volunteer position at CAVE. this program has extremely fun programs trust me you'll love it.",
            "There really isn't that much variety when it comes to food because Sutter Dining serves almost the same thing every week. For example ,Italian sausage sandwich Monday ten the next Monday again. It can get tiring. However you are allowed to use your meals in Sutter Cafe and every semester you can get flex cash which allows you to eat in the Marketplace and any of the participating cafe, which is awesome.",
            "Truthfully it depends on which roommates you can get. They can be awesome like mine or they can be hard party animals like my friend's. you can enjoy dorm experience with your roommates or you can make some new friends and hang out with them. Your resident adviser will be your biggest help whenever you have a question and will keep you informed of most of the activities going on in your hall.",
            "DO NOT be fooled into believing that the class is easy just because the title looks simple! It will probably be the hardest class you may have! The teachers are great whenever you need help and they will actually take the time to show you step by step but they will NOT baby you. You must in the effort as well.",
            "Look at the facts. Don't listen to what other people say because every one is different and no one know you better than yourself. Be prepared and be open-minded about the many people you may meet. Be friendly but don't lose yourself trying to impress others.",
            "This is a green campus and is full of open-mined people that are kind and caring. The city surrounding the school is beautiful and though it is considered a 'party city' you don't have to be a party person. Their is almost no pressure to do something your not comfortable with and much of the focus of the school is based on your academics."

My mind changed at summer orientation when I saw all of the clubs and opportunities Chico actually gave you. -If you have a meal plan try and organize how many meals a week you should be having. Because both semesters I had so many meals left over and the last week I tried to eat around 5 times a day! -Be prepared for both extreme heat from August to early October, and extreme cold in the winter. And when I say extreme I mean extreme for someone from the Bay Area. (100degrees and 30degrees), 217698=Okay, I'm going to divide the food and dining into two categories-the dining hall on campus and dining out in town. The Sutter Dining Hall was only recently opened in 2011, so it's extremely new and modern. However, the food options aren't necessarily the greatest. But I guarantee if you ask anyone at any school, they'll all tell you that they're dining hall stinks. Now as for downtown dining, it's awesome. There's a great pizza place called Celestino's (it's been a huge staple while I've lived in Chico), and also a burger/bar joint called The Bear (you have to try the jiffy burger...yes, it's a burger with peanut butter on it!), 584889=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
