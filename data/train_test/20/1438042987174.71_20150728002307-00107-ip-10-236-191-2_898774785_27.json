    "textAfterTable": "Food and Dining The cafeteria is conveniently located and has pretty good food. The atmosphere is nice with a beautiful fountain and is also a good place to hang out between classes. Dorm Life I live off campus but have heard that the dorms are nice for the price. Academic Rigor I have completed three classes and I believe that the program is suitable for parents and people who work full time. The materials were challenging, interesting and kept my attention. Tips for prospective students My first tip is to make sure you talk to your financial aid counselor. My second tip is to talk to your academic advisor. My third tip is if you have any other problems go to ONE STOP! In three sentences Bellevue University has exceeded my expectations. The academic advisors and counselors are very accessible, patient, knowledgeable, and helpful! I give Bellevue a 10!
