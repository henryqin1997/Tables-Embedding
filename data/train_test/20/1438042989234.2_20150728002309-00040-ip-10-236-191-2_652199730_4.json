While the 2011 tournament was won by an international selection, we are planning to change the format of the cup; it will be organzied most likely by research topics instead of national teams (since there were not enough nationals for each country last time). We are planning to play on Wednesday afternoon (July 24) in Waterloo Park. \u00a0A field has been reserved for play from 2:00 - 5:00pm. \u00a0The basic setting is a round robin followed by direct elimination rounds concluded by a little final and the big final. \u00a0Depending on the total number of players, teams will consist of 5-7 players and games will last between 10 and 20 minutes. \u00a0In total we are hoping for 6 to 8 teams. The exact time and format (teams and game plan) will be decided over the next couple of weeks before the conference, according to the number of participants and their properties. A priori, teams will correspond to thematics:, 71606=\u00a0 Wednesday, July 24th, 75888=\u00a0 Thursday, July 25th, 115577=A Shift in Time featuring the TorQ Percussion Quartet Thursday, July 25th @ 7:30pm Mike Lazaridis Theatre, Perimeter Institute Loops 13 features a unique concert opportunity that integrates art with science. This musical presentation reveals a special duality between quantum gravity and sound featuring the talents of the TorQ Percussion Quartet. TorQ\u2019s program \u201cA Shift in Time\u201d examines the phenomenon of time and space in a rhythmic paradigm. Each piece explores a specific music compositional device and variations surrounding it, including metric modulation, phasing, spatial aural spectra, and acoustic delay. During the conference period the TorQ Percussion Quartet will engage with our delegates and PI community and these interactions will provide inspiration for improvisational pieces for the upcoming concert. Don't miss out on this fantastic event, an evening of percussion mastery presented by the TorQ Percussion Quartet, featuring sounds from the driving rhythms of wood to the Doppler pulsations of metallic keyboard instruments. \u00a0Reserve your ticket now!
