            "I've never felt un-safe on campus. I suppose it would be nice to see more security personnel sometimes. I've never had any problems.",
            "I really don't know much about the Greek life except that it exists. I do notice a lot of service fraternities/sororities which I think is ideal.",
            "As I mentioned above: If you're into sports, your head will spin with options. The Rec center has all kinds of stuff including rock-climbing, a pool, fitness classes, indoor track, etc. There are more student groups than I can count. And you can always get involved as an intern on the radio station, watch FREE movies in one of the campus theaters, be a part of plays, dance concerts, and other events... If you're bored at MTSU, it's your fault.",
            "Anyone who wants the value of a public university, a diverse student body, tons of resources with the feel of a smaller university.",
            "The Library has a kind of courtyard in front of it where you will see people playing games, reading, practicing guitar/cello/singing, just hanging out, catching some fresh air... And it has a unique collection of sayings engraved in the pavement where brick bench areas offer plentiful seating. It's a really great space you might not expect.",
            "I feel like I get more than I pay for as far as tuition. The Library alone has everything you could ever need including a writing lab that connects you with a tutor one-on-one by online appt, usually that same day. I have NEVER waited to use a computer or a printer. Facilities range from hundred-year-old-buildings to brand new ones. It seems the campus is always updating something which I think is great.",
            "Where do I start? If you're into sports, your head will spin with options.

            "There are a lot of options across campus at pretty reasonable prices. The Subway on campus is overpriced in my opinion. But other outside vendors offer everything from coffee to sushi is a fun environment. The dining hall (separate from the other commercial restaurants) is all you can eat with tons of healthy and usually tasty choices. The milk they serve is from cattle raised by the University's Agriculture program which I think is really cool.",
            "I only have one other reference for this category which was Nashville State Community College. I feel like the academic pressures here are only a little bit higher. It's a very doable standard for anyone willing to work and ask for help when they need it.",
            "REGISTER EARLY! MTSU is a very popular school so classes can fill up quickly. Also, the summer semester is a great time to get ahead on your courses and get more personalized attention from teachers. It's a big campus, so be prepared to walk quite a bit.",
            "MTSU has a great vibe, lots of resources, helpful staff, and a varied student body. I was pleasantly surprised at how personalized everything feels considering how large the school is. As an adult completing my bachelor's after an 8 year break from school, I'm very happy I choose this school."

There is also a building called the KOM its located on the northwest side of MT it was the first learning building built at MTSU., 22802=The academics are some of the best in the country seeing as we're ranked #47 in public colleges for 2010-2011. I feel that there is so much offered that is free here, but cost at other colleges. Free printing and other services on campus, who could not love that?, 951390=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 28354=It's a wonderful school for music people! They have a GREAT music program! If I may say so, it's the best in the state of Tennessee! The Honors Program is great! It has wonderful professors and a great building (although it's kind of far from the center of campus). MTSU started off as a teacher college. The new education building is having the finishing touches put on it as we speak. There should also be a new parking garage in a few years and by the end of the fall 2011 semester (I think) the new Student Union will be finished! So students looking for the old and the new both encompasses in a campus should look no further than MTSU!, 583348=If you are a young adult looking for a good education, you may find it here! Be sure to have your ducks in a row math wise, since they seem to keep students in a never ending loop of taking math 1100 semester after semester and ultimately ends in failure!, 639934=Applications are on a first come first serve basis. If you apply in January, usually you know if you have been accepted in a month or two., 512071=I attended MTSU from 2007-2009 and loved it. The campus is welcoming, beautiful, and the possibilities for involvement are endless. I am excited to be going back this coming spring to finish my degree as a non-traditional student., 139395=There is a great selection of food on this campus like Pizza Hut Chick-fil-a and an Asian place along with other favorites! MTSU is all about good for for there students there are 2 dining halls and snack machines everywhere and the new student union building with all new restaurants will be open Fall 2012., 913621=It's Murfreesboro. There is a good deal of crime here but the amount of cops here probably outnumbers the citizens in this city 2:1. Just be smart about where you're going and when/with who., 544638=1. Meet as many new people as possible! It's college you will need them! 2. I would not recommend 8 O'clock classes unless you are a morning person. 3. Remember that some science classes require a lab, which makes this a 4 credit hour class., 387698=can't say, i haven't had class yet. im an incoming freshman 2012, 766450=There is a 24/7 police force that works only for MTSU. Call 2424 and they will be there in three minutes or less. There is also a texting alert system that alerts students if there is a part of campus one should avoid, like if there was an armed robbery or bomb threat. The campus police will even walk you to and from buildings at night if you get scared.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Wants Large School On a budget Aerospace Fashion Design Recording Industry Global Studies Mass Communication Tips for prospective students MTSU should not be overlooked. Also, even though Murfreesboro seems like a small town, MTSU is huge - with over 25,000 students! One you here, you HAVE to get involved. Find something you enjoy and meet others with the same interests. Also, MTSU is not car-friendly. Parking is never fun, so living in a dorm will be very easy to navigate the campus. Bang for the buck It's a very cheap school compared to a whole lot of other universities and MTSU is just as good. Most professors really care about your time here as well as all of the student services. You do pay a couple thousand dollars.. but you truly get a lot out of it! Am enjoying being here I love MTSU! It truly has so much to offer, but you'll miss it if you don't utilize all the different services! From cheap outdoor trips to offices devoted to helping you write papers to language labs - MTSU has it all. It's a great music-oriented school with a great Recording Industry program,",
