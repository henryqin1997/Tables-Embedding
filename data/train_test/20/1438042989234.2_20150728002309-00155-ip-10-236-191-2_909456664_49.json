            "What Greek Life?",
            "The Clubs are so much fun. They can easily become a second family. Members, not matter what club, care for you and what to see you succeed.",
            "The financial aid is great. Augsburg has been really great with aiding students financially.",
            "If you're into sports, there is a nice turf field(Dome during the winter) to play Soccer or Football or what have you. There is also a large gym in the Kennedy Center. And of course, there are some weight rooms. For musicians, there are some piano practice rooms in the Music Hall where you can spend some time playing the piano or bring your own guitar and just jam out. Also, there are two concert venues at walking distance from campus, The Cedar Riverside Center and The Triple Rock. For anyone just looking to shop/eat/hangout/watch movies, you can just hop on the lightrail and go to the Mall of America. There is so much to do there. So much.",
            "The food from the Commons(main cafeteria) is not the best. It gets repetitive really quick. But there a lot of other places to go on or around campus like: Nabo, Afro Deli, Taco Bell, Subway, Davanni's, Jimmy Johns and Chipotle which are no farther than a three block walk from campus.",
            "I don't live on campus and I don't really plan to. I do have friends who live on campus though. And sometimes I'll hangout or even sleepover so I have a slight sense of what it's like to live on campus. The dorms are nothing special. It seems like at least one of the Mort elevators is always 'out of order'. No A/C in Urness or Mort, so it can get really hot at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year. But since it is a small school, it is incredibly convenient to live on campus. I can easily leave the dorm with eight minutes left till class starts and make it on time without having to run.",
            "My classes haven't really been hard, so far. Have they made me think critically? Yes. But it's not something I wasn't used to. Some of my high school I.B courses were tougher than some of my classes. I think that in college, It only gets tough when you can't organize your time to do homework and study. I should also mention that when classes seemed to be getting too challenging, I was able to talk to my professors about it and they would do whatever they could to help me understand the material. I think that is reason why it hasn't felt that rigorous so far, the professors do their best to make college manageable and achievable for anyone.",
            "No matter what college you go to, remember: It's not high school anymore. Get organized and do your work. It isn't the professor's job to nag at you. It's your future on the line, and your money I might add. But of course, enjoy yourself! Make friends. Go to social college events. Join clubs! Augsburg has some fabulous clubs. Take advantage of the library and the friendly staff that is there to help you with essays or what have you. There are a lot of resources on campus to help. Use them!",
            "A great small college in the city. This school has helped me grow in many ways, not just academically. The friends I've made here will definitely be life-long friends."
