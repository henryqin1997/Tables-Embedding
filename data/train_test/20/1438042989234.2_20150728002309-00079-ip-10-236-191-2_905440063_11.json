I came from NH and usually travelled back home every weekend. This may have changed, but from 2005-2009 it was mostly commuter students attending., 197961=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 97765=free period on Wednesdays between 12:30 and 1. the students get a break from classes to have fun. Each Wednesday there is something else going on in the quad., 75585=I don't recall any greek life at Rhode Island College. This may have changed since 2009 though!, 112412=Rhode Island College does not have a great dorm life, being that oct of the students are commuters, there are few students who live on campus. The dorms are not that great either, but with the right friends you can still have a blast. If you are looking for a party school this is not the school for you., 172611=Pick classes that will fit into your schedule but also times that are appropriate for yourself. From my experience, my first semester I chose a 8:00 A.M. Monday-Thursday however I am not a morning person so it reflected my ability to focus in class. As long as you pay attention in class, the work is not that hard. Papers are usually given ahead of time so its best not to procrastinate and leave for last minute. Good luck to those who think about attending!, 11050=I started school at Rhode Island College in August, and from then on it has been a period of discovery. The resources available on campus are great, and everyone is so helpful. Although the tuition is inexpensive in comparison to other schools, parking is constantly crowded. This is a minor setback when your talking about getting a good educational experience. Socially, there are a lot of clubs and organizations you can join. Overall RIC gets 5 stars in my book.}",

Very difficult to fit in and make friends if you don't already know someone. Just like high school all over again. Bang for the buck It's definitely a cheap school money wise and you do get a lot for your money although the freshmen dorms are disgusting and leave a lot to be desired but that is to be expected from such an inexpensive school. The food isn't great either. Am enjoying being here There is never anything of real interest going on on campus until the end of the year. The clubs are geared toward very",
