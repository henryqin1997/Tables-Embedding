Fashion is not only about dressing well, but also about dressing with imagination. Everyone goes through times when they don\u2019t know what to wear, so inspiration is always a good idea, and I\u2019ve got a few great sources for you to rely on. One of the primary sources for a designer\u2019s insight is nature. Time and again, we see feathers flitting down runways, thick furs draped to perfection and shoes made of leather or other animal products. Yet, designers also draw ideas from the look of nature, itself., 30199=Monday \u2014 Shuffle board tournament Tuesday \u2014 Fuse beads Wednesday \u2014 Movies and munchies Thursday \u2014 Decorate the board (open 8 a.m.-6 p.m.) Friday \u2014 Pool tourney (open 8 a.m.-6 p.m.) All students in third through eighth grades are welcome to join free of charge. The centers are at 475 20th St. (by Ashley Pond) and 10 Sherwood Blvd. (by Pi\u00f1on Park). Call 662-9412 or 672-1565 or more information., 41662=Copyright \u00a9 2015, 27787=Count Dracula chose the residents of Los Alamos as his next victims on Feb. 17. The New Mexico Dance Theater Performance Company brought the Transylvania terror to the Duane Smith Auditorium with \u201cDracula,\u201d the ballet. The performance, adapted from the 1897 novel, \u201cDracula,\u201d by Bram Stoker, was directed by Susan Baker-Dillingham and showcased two days of performances. The cast consisted primarily of high school teens and was supported by the younger, junior and apprentice members of the troop. Some adult guests contributed to the cast. The ballet was silent, so the actors communicated through their elaborate actions and dances. The exceptional concerto music contributed to the dramatic feel of the play., 20949=The centers are at 475 20th St. (by Ashley Pond) and 10 Sherwood Blvd. (by Pi\u00f1on Park).
