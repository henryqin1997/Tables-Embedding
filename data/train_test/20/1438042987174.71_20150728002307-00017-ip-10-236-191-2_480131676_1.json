To see it in its entirety, please follow this link. I gave this a 3.5. My Overall Thoughts/Impressions: First off, I'd like to thank netgalley and the publisher for allowing me to review this novel. And secondly, I didn't read the previous one in this series. However, you can start at this point and be fine. The characters in the first novel are vaguely mentioned in this one, but are not the central story. And now for my review, I really enjoyed reading this one. It was very well-written and one that was really enjoyable. The writing was compelling and the characters were interesting. Sisters Emma and Jeannie's families are really close. But when Emma's daughter, Sadie hits her cousin Tessa with her car, she manages to kill Tessa and break the two families apart. This novel tackled the issue of forgiveness, family bonds, and faith in a very poignant way. I found this book to be an emotional read, but one that I enjoyed reading. I loved the pacing of this story and the real emotion I could tell each character was feeling. This novel switched perspectives and I actually enjoyed being able to dig deeper into each character's mind. One that I definitely enjoyed. I will be sure to keep an eye out for this author. In Summary: A very well-written novel that I loved reading. A very engaging emotional read about families, faith, and forgiveness. ...more",

I'm a succor for spy books and historical fiction. Basically, I love this entire genre, so I went into this novel with very high expectations. I was also fairly confident that this book wouldn't live up to my expectations. And I was right, it didn't live up to my expectations--it surpassed them. This novel was even better than I had hoped it would be. From the very first page, I was captivated by this story. I loved Maddie's character and found it very easy to connect to her tale. The writing was well-crafted and really conveyed the voice of a fifteen year old girl living in 1861. I easily felt myself getting attached to her character and felt like I was seeing the world through her eyes. The character development throughout the novel was spectacular. It has been awhile since I read a novel that had characters that I found so likable and easy to connect to. This book was one that left me smiling and thoroughly intrigued the entire time I was reading it. Every time I started reading it, I found myself being sucked into the story. I would definitely recommend this novel to anybody who loves historical fiction, spy books, war books, and just ya in general. This novel was amazing and I will definitely be keeping tabs on both this series and this author. In Summary: A masterfully written YA historical novel that left me captivated from the very first page to the very last page. Plus it's a book about spies, what is not to love?

My Overall Thoughts/Impressions:I feel like the synopsis did an excellent job at capturing the spirit of this book. I'd like to start out by thanking the publisher and netgalley for allowing me to review this book. This was the first book I've read by Sandra D. Bricker and I absolutely loved it. I'm definitely going to have to read the first two now. Yes, I read this out of order. Something I hate doing, but this sounded so good that I had to read it. I didn't feel lost at all. If I hadn't researched the synopsis of the first two novels, I might not have even known that characters from the previous novels were in this one. While reading the series in order is definitely recommended, I don't feel like a reader would feel lost if they didn't. Having said that, I'd like to turn to why I loved this book. The writing style was so cute and lighthearted. I loved Bricker's flair. I also liked that the story took turn between Audrey's and J.R.'s perspectives. I love when romances switch off between the perspectives. And I absolutely loved all the characters in this novel. I'm going to focus on J.R. and Audrey though. Audrey is the type of girl that I'd want as a best friend. She was a character that I connected to and enjoyed reading about. And then there was J.R. who was just roguish enough for me to love him, but at the same time an incredible guy. I love the part of the synopsis that says \"Oh, wait. He actually did ride in on a Harley.\" That right there captures a huge portion of his character. The Christian element was really minor in the story and wasn't forced. It seemed very naturally placed. I wouldn't classify this as a Christian romance, but rather a romance that had a few Christian elements. I loved this story and highly recommend it to anybody looking for a romantic comedy that is lighthearted, well-written, and just down right entertaining. ...more",
