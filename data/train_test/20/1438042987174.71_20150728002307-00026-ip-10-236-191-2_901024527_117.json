            "Definitely a lot of resources in addition to the fact that Boise is a really safe city. Escort services, emergency call buttons, etc.",
            "It exists, but they don't have houses.",
            "Yeah, like I said. There are a ton.",
            "Really anyone. They let everyone in for a reason.",
            "It's one of the cheapest schools I got into. On campus living I don't think is worth it if you don't have money to blow, but tuition isn't a big financial hardship.",
            "Oh, my. I'm in like 10 clubs. There's so much to do on campus and off. 1. Hundreds of clubs. 2. Varsity or club sports, the rec center. 3. Parties (Which I don't really attend, but they're there. Off campus, of course, it's a dry campus.). 4. Boise: coffee shops, concerts (the music scene is getting better), bars if you're into that, OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES OF ANY KIND",
            "They have a pretty wide variety of restaurants. I hear the cafeteria food gets boring. But again, I don't have a meal plan because I don't live on campus.",
            "I wouldn't know, I don't live there. From what I've observed and researched, off campus housing has way more bang for your buck amenities and facilities-wise. The social atmosphere of living on campus obviously can't be replicated, though.",
            "It's hard in STEM generals and honors classes because it's busy work, not because you're learning anything. There are other programs and classes that have a wonderful reputation, though, especially social sciences, business, and communications.",
            "ASK STUDENTS ABOUT THE PROGRAM YOU'RE GOING INTO. Can't stress that enough.",
            "It has a beautiful campus with lots of resources. Social life and activities are plentiful. Academic quality varies a lot depending on the program you're in, especially because they have a tendency to keep terrible professors around because of their seniority."

There is some thing for everyone!, 62561=Fall of 2011 will be my first year in college so I'm bound to learn a lot., 251250=I went for the Orientation in June. It was awesome. It has a great sense of community within the campus and you will most certainly enjoy the experience., 179111=Get applications in early. Scholarship applications are due in February and March. Make sure and plan ahead accordingly., 10854=Boise State education is some of the best that you can get in the state of Idaho. With the student to teacher ratio being around 1:19, you can always find the help that you need when it comes to the academics. Every year, BSU is improving the facilities to improve the academics. The professors for the most part are extremely helpful and friendly, and care about the education that you are getting. You can always find help, whether its asking another student, attending tutor sessions, or meeting with the professors., 633463=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 39214=Boise State University is known for the football team and blue turf, on game day to reserve student tickets, students will wake up around 7:00 AM to reserve their spots for the upcoming game!, 61791=I grew up in a tiny rural town in Texas and have been looking forward to living in the city were events are close by. I know I will enjoy the boise campus because while being located in a large city (30 miles wide) it still holds the great characteristics of a small school. Everyone on the campus was friendly and helpful during my Orientation (June 9th and 10th 2011). It felt like a place I could grow and learn happily. Even my parents fears were resolved during orientation., 442883=I'm excited to get started in the fall. I attended the first summer orientation in June. I will be staying on campus., 82462=the tuition rise in 2010 caused me to stop attending. The other problem with this is that many paper test where canceled and the online testing doesn't have enough space or accommodations for working or busy students.The test available are rarely available during your usually meeting times}",
