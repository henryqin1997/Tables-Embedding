That night, the Montreal Expos defeated the New York Mets 3-1 at Olympic Stadium. Expos catcher Nelson Santovenia hit a home run off of Mets pitcher Ron Darling and Tim Raines drove in a run to lead the Expos to victory. John Miller and analyst Joe Morgan provided commentary., 77367=Odds to win the 2013 AL Pennant\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 83281=Odds to Win the 2013 AL Central \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 76959=Houston Astros\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1000/1, 84272=Odds to Win the 2013 AL West \u00a0, 54469=Odds to win 2013 World Series, 109532=Perhaps not the most significant story of the year, the story of Steve Johnson has likely been the most heart warming for Charm City in 2012., 101600=Odds to win the 2013 NL Cy Young\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 114735=But after 2009 (5.40 ERA 1.554 WHIP in 12 starts), 2010 (5.87 ERA 1.528 WHIP in 11 starts) and 2011 (5.52 ERA 1.645 WHIP in 13 starts), it appeared as though Tillman was all but done in Baltimore., 72486=Odds to win the 2013 World Series\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 12380=Posted on 01 August 2014 by Glenn Clark, 86150=Odds to Win the 2013 NL Central \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 112170=Certainly the deal has turned out to be quite the feather in Duquette\u2019s cap, as has the signing of SP Wei-Yin Chen-who has pitched to a 4.02 ERA and 1.261 WHIP over 32 starts? The only real question mark for Duquette has been Tsuyoshi Wada, who needed Tommy John surgery before he could make a pitch. The way things are going for this organization, you almost assume he\u2019ll be Stephen Strasburg in 2013. (Okay\u2026not really.), 47442=Posted on 10 January 2014 by WNST Staff, 54904=Odds to win the 2013 World Series MVP\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 107742=Posted on 05 October 2012 by Glenn Clark, 32590=Posted on 06 July 2014 by WNST Staff, 107840=It has certainly been a \u201cstorybook\u201d season for the Baltimore Orioles in 2012. No matter how their postseason run ends, there will be memories that will last for a lifetime., 92440=Odds to win the 2013 NL MVP\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 82374=Odds to Win the 2013 AL East\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 14164=It was a real \u201choly crap\u201d moment in my life of following baseball. It was in that Ruben Sierra for Jose Canseco territory of truly stunning deals. It was bold, it is most certainly questionable and it solidifies what we already knew-that the Athletics are absolutely the team to beat when we get to October., 108821=McLouth has been a significant contributor since being called up in August, taking over the every day LF spot and batting leadoff since Nick Markakis got hurt. Ford hasn\u2019t contributed quite as much, but has come up with three big home runs when inserted into the lineup against lefties., 42206=The\u00a0Sunday Night Baseball\u00a0game selection for May 4 will be determined and announced in the next few weeks. Additionally, selections for June games and for July 6 and July 27 will be made three weeks in advance, while selections for August and September games will be made two weeks in advance., 109893=A Kingsville native, former St. Paul\u2019s star and son of a former Orioles pitcher (and current broadcast analyst) made some of the more significant starts of the 2012 season. It\u2019s Hollywood quality stuff.\u00a0Even more amazingly, Johnson picked up his first big league win on August 8, 23 years removed from the exact date his father picked up HIS first victory during the Birds\u2019 incredible 1989 campaign., 47748=ESPN will begin its historic 25th\u00a0Major League Baseball season with an exclusive presentation of\u00a0MLB\u2019s\u00a0Opening Night on ESPN presented by Scotts\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Los Angeles Dodgers at San Diego Padres\u00a0\u2013 on\u00a0Sunday Night Baseball, March 30, at 8 p.m. ET.\u00a0The new\u00a0Sunday Night Baseballteam of Dan Shulman, analysts John Kruk and Curt Schilling and reporter Buster Olney will make their regular-season debut to call the action. Opening Night will be available across ESPN platforms, including ESPN, ESPN Radio (with Jon Sciambi and Chris Singleton), ESPN Deportes, ESPN Deportes Radio and via WatchESPN., 79925=Odds to win the 2013 NL Pennant\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 25682=Posted on 29 July 2014 by Glenn Clark, 115161=Perhaps even more improbable was Miguel Gonzalez, who was all but abandoned by the Boston Red Sox following 2009 Tommy John surgery. Executive Director of International Recruiting\u00a0Fred Ferreira signed off on Gonzalez to the Birds after seeing him throw just nine pitches (according to SI\u2019s Albert Chen). Perhaps we should have expected the man who discovered Vladimir Guerrero knew what he was doing., 15454=That said, where Cespedes has been better as an average hitter in 2014-Davis has actually maintained a better on-base percentage. Cespedes certainly provides a plus outfield arm, but Davis has been a solid defensive player., 72288=Posted on 04 June 2013 by WNST Staff, 33151=Lackey was almost certainly referring to the 50 game suspension Cruz received in 2013 related to PED\u2019s and his association to Biogenesis., 48448=Baseball Tonight\u00a0presented by Scotts\u00a0will begin Opening Night festivities with a special 90-minute pre-game show at 6:30 p.m. Karl Ravech will host the telecast with Baseball Hall of Famer and analyst Barry Larkin, Kruk and Schilling., 96943=Odds to win the 2013 AL Cy Young\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 53716=Posted on 21 October 2013 by WNST Staff, 20360=The Orioles may have done everything they could to put together a viable package in exchange for the All-Star left hander and someone else may have simply had more to offer. If that had been the case, there wouldn\u2019t have been much for guys like me to complain about. Lester was the PERFECT rental player to consider doing something bold to acquire as the team looks to take advantage of their best chance to win a World Series since 1997., 85918=Miami Marlins\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1000/1, 82165=Miami Marlins\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1500/1, 108371=It isn\u2019t SO crazy to think a team would have given OF Nate McLouth another chance in 2012. The former Pittsburgh Pirates All-Star was at least playing Major League Baseball, even if he hadn\u2019t had a particularly good season since 2009., 89475=Odds to win the 2013 AL MVP\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 37315=ESPN\u2019s historic 25th\u00a0season of\u00a0Sunday Night Baseball\u00a0presented by Taco Bell\u00a0\u2013 Major League Baseball\u2019s exclusive, national game of the week \u2013 will showcase baseball\u2019s most exciting teams, best rivalries and brightest stars throughout 2014. The season will begin with an exclusive presentation of\u00a0MLB\u2019s Opening Night on ESPN presented by Scotts\u00a0\u2013 Los Angeles Dodgers at San Diego Padres \u2013 on March 30 at 8 p.m. ET. \u00a0Baseball Tonight\u00a0will precede the telecast with a special 90-minute pre-game show at 6:30 p.m. hosted by Karl Ravech., 15017=Much like Cespedes-Davis is a free agent at the end of next season and has provided quite the mixed bag at the plate this season. While he appeared to be establishing himself as one of the dominant power hitters in baseball in 2013, he\u2019s struggled in just about every aspect of his game in 2014. He\u2019s battled injuries, his batting average is atrocious and he hasn\u2019t even gotten to the 20 home run mark for the season yet., 27421=Lester has had an outstanding career including two World Series titles-but his 2014 season is shaping up to be his best. As he heads toward free agency, the 30 year old is 10-7 with a dazzling 2.52 ERA and sparkling 1.11 WHIP over 21 starts. It is logical that the Red Sox are listening to trade offers for him (and reportedly John Lackey as well) after dealing Jake Peavy to San Francisco over the weekend. After suffering a blowout loss Monday night, the Sox fell to 48-58 on the season and are 11 games back of the Orioles in last place in the AL East., 112903=I probably don\u2019t need to show you August. Ah hell, I\u2019ll show you August.}",
