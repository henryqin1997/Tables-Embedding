Scattered hail producing t'storm also rolled through the Schoharie and Mohawk valleys between 8pm and 9:30pm. The final blow from the storm came as the system pulled out of the region producing a period of high winds late Saturday night through Sunday morning with frequent gusts ranging from 40-50 mph., 6434=Image #1: ENX (Albany National Weather Service Doppler radar) base reflectivity image at 7:45pm, Saturday March 8, 2008 of the line of t'storms over Columbia and Dutchess counties, heading east into Berkshire and Litchfield counties in western New England, 115=Major Storm, Heavy Rain, Severe T'Storms, Flooding, Regional Ice, High Wind Friday Afternoon through Sunday Morning March 7-9 This was the second major storm of the week coming in with torrential rain, two periods of freezing rain in select areas, isolated severe t-storms, flooding, and a period of high winds. The basin wide storm total rainfall of 1.5\"-3\", on top of the 2\"-3\" of rain that fell just a day and a half before, resulted in widespread urban poor drainage flooding, as well as minor to moderate flooding of many major streams, creeks, and rivers, such as the Esopus, the Housatonic, and the Hudson as well as flash flooding in Delaware, Greene, Ulster, Dutchess, Columbia, and Berkshire and Litchfield counties in western New England., 4068=Saturday March 8: Torrential Rain/North Country Ice Storm/Isolated Severe T'Storms With the departure of the first batch of moisture during the pre-dawn hours on Saturday the region was left in a brief lull with patchy very light rain, drizzle, and fog, which lasted through the early to mid morning on the 8th. The main storm moved from its Friday evening position over Arkansas to West Virginia by the early to mid afternoon, tapping into another large moisture area which had formed over Florida. The approach of the low and an associated powerful 140 knot jet stream at an unusually low altitude of 20,000 feet, caused heavy rain to break out over New York and New England by the late morning. The storm strengthened on its approach which induced a northerly low level cold air drainage flow over eastern New York and western New England causing temperatures to slowly drop through the 30s as the rain fell, with sub-freezing air filtering through the Adirondacks, Vermont, into the northern reaches of the Catskills and the Capital Region. With the storm pulling in huge amounts of both gulf and Atlantic moisture heavy rain fell, with heavy freezing rain in Hamilton and Warren counties and patchy freezing rain into the northern Catskills and Capital Region as well. Heavy icing occurred in the Adirondacks with more of a light glaze where freezing rain occurred further south. By the early evening the storm center tracked to a position near Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, PA with the circulation forcing the system's warm front up into the mid Hudson valley and Berkshire County and a subsequent brief jump in temperatures into the lower 50s. The combination of the warmer and more unstable air interacting with the powerful storm caused a line of locally severe thunderstorms to develop in Columbia and Dutchess counties between 7:30pm and 8:00pm which went on to produce wind damage in Berkshire and Litchfield counties as they raced to the east-northeast at 50 mph. Other thunderstorms in Schoharie, Montgomery, Fulton, Schenectady, and Saratoga counties between 8pm and 9:30 pm produced localized torrential rain and small hail. Click Here for Hail and Ice Pictures, 14003=WeatherNet 6 and National Weather Service Spotter Storm Total Rainfall Reports for the March 7-9, 2008 Storm, 6898=Sunday, March 9: High Winds Heavy rain moved out of the region between 9pm and 11pm on the 8th as the storm rapidly raced to the northeast just west of the Hudson and Champlain valleys with it clearing the region during the predawn hours on Sunday the 9th. A tight pressure gradient behind the departing powerful storm and high pressure building into the Ohio valley caused a period of strong winds to develop over eastern New York and western New England during the pre-dawn hours on the 9th with frequent gusts ranging from 40-50 mph. The peak gust of 52 mph at Albany occurred at 1:56 am, 50 mph @ North Adams, MA at 5:18am, and 47 mph @ Pittsfield, MA at 3:54am on the 9th with gusts only dropping to between 35 and 40 mph through the day on Sunday. The combination of the high winds and ice laden trees in Hamilton and Warren counties caused more power outages to occur through Sunday leaving many without lights and heat into the day on Monday March 10., 2290=Set Up/Sequence of Events Friday March 7 Much of the morning and the early afternoon featured pleasant and dry weather conditions with sunshine and temperatures ranging from the mid 40s to the lower 50s. Clouds rapidly moved into the region during the afternoon with light rain into the Catskills by 3:30 pm and by 4:30 pm in the Capital Region. This rainfall was along the leading edge of a significant slug of moisture that was riding up the spine of the Appalachians, running well in advance of and displaced well north and east of the main upper air and surface storm, which at this time was located over Arkansas where it was producing snow. Simultaneous with the arrival of the light rain came the passage of a cold front through eastern New York and western New England which introduced a colder and drier air mass. This air was cooled further by evaporative processes as the rain, which quickly expanded in coverage and intensity through the evening, fell into the dry layer. Temperatures dropped into the 30s during the evening with enough cooling in Hamilton County to cause the rain to switch to snow by 5:30pm and for pockets of freezing rain to develop elsewhere across the north country. Warming, however, was rapid, allowing the snow and patchy freezing rain to change back to rain by 9:30pm with the bulk of the first installment of moisture moving out of the region during the pre-dawn hours on Saturday, March 8. Snowfall totals in Hamilton County ranged from 1/4\" to as much as 3\" in the higher elevations (3\" @ Indian Lake, 1.5\" @ Speculator and Wells, 1\" @ Northville, 1/4\" @ Arietta) with rainfall amounts generally averaging 1/3\"-3/4\" by midnight.}",

The impacts of the wintry side of the system were limited to the north country through much of the storm's duration with a brief period of snow Friday evening in Hamilton County along with pockets of freezing rain. The bigger wintry hit occurred on Saturday in the Adirondacks where a prolonged ice storm occurred resulting in heavy ice accumulations in Hamilton and Warren counties with widespread power outages reported and a state of emergency declared in the town of Hague (Warren County) at 9:30pm on Saturday due to icing and downed trees. Light icing briefly developed in areas as far south as the Capital Region Saturday afternoon with light to moderate icing into the higher",
