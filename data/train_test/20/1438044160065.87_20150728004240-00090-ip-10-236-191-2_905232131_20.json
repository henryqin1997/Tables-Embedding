            "Get in and get out degree seeking people, who don't want the lack of education put in.",
            "Its less exspensive and you recieve more finiancial aid which is ALWAYS a plus! Not saying blow the extra bucks you do get, of course! Lol",
            "Their isn't a cafeteria within MATC but theirs a TON of restaurants near by, and even The Grand Shopping mall.",
            "No dorms of course, Tech school.",
            "One thing I learned and was often told later down the road of me signing up for MATC was to NEVER under estimate this school. Their is not Technical about this school but their Degree's, lol. They are just as hard as any other schools with teachers that's going to make you work just as hard as any 4 year university.",
            "Make sure you know what you need and GET IT! MATC is wonderful but their telephone lines are SOOOOO not answerable its crazy! Plan to even go up there for any here and there questions as well, that one question may just save you some money, OR even open a window of many resources you hadn't known about, It did for me :)",
            "I didn't exactly hope attending MATC. Considering the fact that this school was not my top choice, talking to very nice teachers and helpful faculty here I am now looking forward to going here at Milwaukee Area Technical College!"
