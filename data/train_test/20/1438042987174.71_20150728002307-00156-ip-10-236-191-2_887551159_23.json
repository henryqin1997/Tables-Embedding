            "Anyone interested in film, writing, theater, or journalism this is the place for you! Also, anyone who wants experience in this areas and is maybe interested in political science or marketing will thrive.",
            "It's not really a true liberal arts education, you come in with a major and have to stick to that major for your time there (if you really want to change, you can freshman year but after that you're screwed). So, it's not a school for someone who doesn't know what they want.",
            "It's really pricey ($1,011 per credit), but it's worth it if you make sure to get involved. The whole point of Emerson is that you can become more involved in clubs and extra activities around Boston.",
            "It's a really fun place to be! Orientation week every year is basically a huge dance party. The overwhelming amount of students in theater and film make the school a lot of fun, and means that usually something is always going on.",
            "There's a lot of seemingly useless general education classes you have to take. But, overall they're fine and make you a better student (not many colleges require a speech class, but more should!). Classes that pertain to your major are a lot more exciting, and will teach you a great deal."

Write a meaningful essay, an honest essay, and be careful with spelling and grammar., 209039=I visited Emerson on junior day 2013 and loved it. I am definitely going to apply, as should anybody else interested in film, writing, or communications. The location is great as well, basically touching the Boston Commons., 48955=Depending on the building and the individual, dorm life can be great. If you're trying to decide which building to live in, here's a breakdown of them: Little Building: Mostly freshman. Consists of most double, triple, and quad rooms. I believe there's one 6-person sing suite on every floor. Communal bathrooms. Older building; not the cleanest but livable. Also houses the dinning hall, C-Store (convenient store), gym, Cabaret, and many other Emerson offices. I believe there's either a laundry room on every floor or every other floor. (Don't quote me on that though). There's also a Dunkin Donuts downstairs that sometimes sets a bagel on fire, triggering fire alarms for the entire building. This building really is good for socializing as a first-year. There are lots of activities and friendly people. Piano Row: (My current building of living) Mostly freshmen and sophomores. All suite-style living (4 and 6 person). Common rooms (consisting of tv, sitting area, sink, stovetop and microwave) on every other floor. Holds the Max (150 Cafe), laundry room, gymnasium, a large multipurpose room, various meeting spaces for student orgs, and the student service center. Very clean building. I believe it opened as a dorm building in 2006. Colonial: Known as the 21+ dorm building. Holds mostly upperclassmen but is known to also house freshmen and sophomores on occasion. Only building with full kitchens (stove tops and ovens) in their common rooms. Very upscale and nice building. Hasn't been open very long, which makes it very clean. Only place where alcohol is allowed in dorm rooms (ONLY IF YOU'RE OVER 21 THOUGH!). Has laundry room and mail room. Paramount: Houses mostly performing arts students. Smallest dorm building on campus. Also the furthest away from the main Emerson campus. (far away means two blocks - yeah, we're spoiled). Paramount holds a theatre, multiple practice rooms and studios, classrooms, the Paramount Cafe (get the onion rings, they're delicious!), and Emstage's shop and paint studio. This building is recommended for performing arts students and people who don't mind a little extra walk to their classes. The building is very clean and well decorated. Their common rooms have nice kitchen areas as well as flat screen TVs and foosball tables., 276490=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

It will put your foot in the right door. Tips for prospective students Tips: 1) Don't let reviews make your decision. You will read bad reviews, and you will read good reviews. Focus on what is more important for your future. 2) If you're unsure about Emerson College because of the party-scene, don't let that you hold you back. Your education is far more important and trust me, you will have fun if you know the right places to go. 3) You have probably read that Emerson College has a lot of gay people. It does. However, there are plenty of other guys and gals! Bang for the buck Emerson College is extremely expensive,",
