It will be understood by those having skill in the art that changes can be made to this specific embodiment without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The scope of the invention is not to be restricted, therefore, to the specific embodiment, and it is intended that the appended claims cover any and all such applications, modifications, and embodiments within the scope of the present invention. Non-Limiting Examples Shown The usage of SSL sessions today is employed only when required for the protection of commercial transactions and where security is fundament. However it is not used arbitrarily for privacy reasons as the overhead is to high both at the server and at the client. If SSL sessions and particularly security session after the initial setup of an SSL session can be made to be faster then the usage of SSL sessions may grow and be used for additional reasons such as privacy. Furthermore, the computer readable medium may include computer readable information in a transitory state medium such as a network link and/or a network interface, including a wired network or a wireless network, that allow a computer to read such computer readable information. The invention is not limited to any particular computer program or logic or language, or instruction but may be practiced with any such suitable",
