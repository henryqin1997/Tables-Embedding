            "MSU is great if you are self sufficient. It is a large school which means that there are plenty of people but you can get lost in the crowd if you don't look out for yourself. The programs are great and you will have a blast if you can make friends easily since there is always something to do on campus every week.",
            "Get to class at least 15 minutes early and sit up front. Do your homework on time. Make sure to sleep. Try to get to know your professors. Leave your door open so you can get to know the people on your floor.",
            "Tuition is kind of expensive but there are worse schools. I assume everyone else is experiencing tuition hikes as well. All in all, I can't really complain about the costs. It would be really nice if MSU offered more scholarships but so far I haven't found anything that really applies to me (a caucasian with an average/middle class family). It was a nice gesture from MSU to replace the first $500 payment in the now ended Michigan Promise Scholarship Program.",
            "The campus at MSU is beautiful. There are many trees and parks so it is hard to believe that you are in the middle of a very urban area. MSU is also very large so I'd recommend purchasing or bringing a bike to campus if you don't enjoy walking. There is a decent bus system but I have yet to use it since the weather has been holding out this year. We'll see how feasible biking is when the snow hits. The dorm that I live in is part of the South Complex. It is a suite style dorm and is acceptable as far as size goes. There is enough room for my roommate and myself and all our stuff. Though the dorm can be noisy on weekends, it remains quiet enough to get a restful sleep every night and to do homework in. Cafeteria food is acceptable. Working in the cafeteria is also a way to make some spending money but it isn't very emotionally rewarding.",
            "General information about me: I'm currently majoring in Media Arts and Technology which is part of the Communications Department at MSU. I am also in the Academic Scholars program which is the back door entrance into the Honors College so to speak. As an honors student in high school I'm finding my current classes at MSU to rather easy. Admittedly my curriculum isn't the same as a physics or math major so it isn't fair to expect the same level of challenge from the classes, but at the same time I was always told college would be different. But easy classes aren't a sign that the University is bad but that I get bored easily. Even my honors Microeconomics class is reasonable. All of my professors are intelligent and knowledgeable on their respective subjects. Despite the large class sizes in the general education classes I feel like my professors at least care about the students. Any issues I've had have been taken care of quickly and with minimal effort. I expect that once I push through all the general education requirements I will find more challenging and personally interesting classes."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{70649=many different types of dorms are available. some house only 300 students, while others house nearly 1000. about half have community bathrooms for the entire floor, while the other half have suite-style bathrooms shared between two rooms. floors (or at least wings) are typically separated by gender, although coed floors are available. one dorm (yakeley) houses only females. dorms are arranged into complexes which all have at least one cafeteria. some classes are even held in dorm buildings; this is especially common for students in residential academic programs. dorms are constantly being updated and redone to make them pleasant places for students to live. unique residential options are also available in dorms. for example, there are honors floors for honors college students, and quiet floors with special courtesy hours. students can also choose to live in dorms with other students in their major or college. for example, science majors may choose to live in holmes, while political science students may live in case., 337968=I completed 38 credits from spring 2011 to fall 2012 all while working two jobs 40 + hours sometimes and I have a little girl. Let's say at this point I'm burnt out and scholarships would help a lot., 787033=There are many different sororities and fraternities at Michigan State. Greek Week is sometime in September or October and is a great way to meet new people and possibly join a fraternity or sorority., 1027473=MSU is in the process of building/ renovating many of their dining halls on campus. In 2010-2011, they built Brody Cafeteria, which is the largest non-military cafeteria in the world. There are always so many selections, such as, sushi, homestyle cooking, a deli, a dessert bar, a salad bar, stir fry, etc. After building that cafeteria and seeing the success rate, they began remodeling other cafeterias (at least one in each neighborhood) like that as well. The head chef of MSU Culinary Services is constantly striving to be better, despite the rising reviews every year., 69503=every meal plan is unlimited, meaning students can go to the cafeteria as many times as they want. this is especially nice for late-night snack runs and going to the cafe just to socialize. the university is in the process of updating all the cafeterias. three new cafeterias have opened since 2007, and all look similar to a large mall food court. these cafeterias give students many different meal options and are generally better than the other cafeterias. currently the cafeterias in case, brody, and snyder-phillips halls are the best. this section gets three stars because of some of the older cafeterias that have not yet been updated. the new cafeterias would get five stars. regardless of which dorm students call home, they can eat in any cafeteria. students who live off-campus can also purchase smaller meal plans, and eat on campus at their leisure., 180472=It's great. There is food all the way up until 12:00 A.M in some halls!, 1002695=If you are interested in MSU, keep your GPA up and apply early! MSU had over 30K applications and accepted only 8K for the fall of 2012., 1122862=During finals week there is this thing called the Midnight Scream. At 12:00 am every night the students on campus let out a loud scream. This scream is to relieve the stress of finals week., 335993=I'm a non-traditional student trying to complete my first degree so that I can stop working dead end jobs and help to take care of my daughter like a man should. I am a really hard worker. Working two jobs and manage to complete 38 credits without falling below a 3 point is an accomplishment I can live with, in addition I still make the time for my little girl. I would like some assistance to make life a little easier as it is a challenge. I did much of it by myself but I'm no superhero and so now I am asking for help. I have a bill now for over $1800 for this semester., 46431=currently i am enrolled for 14 credits. Monday and Wednesday and Friday i have college algebra from 10:20-11:10 and then on Monday and Wednesday i have Cse101(computer class) from 12:40 to 2:30. my math class is only challenging because i cant understand my teacher, thankfully the book text is really helpful and the online homework, extra practice and so on, really helps me understand the material i don't get in class, and there are reviews for every test. Cse101 is challenging, but I'm glad that it's giving me a broad understanding of Word, Excel, Access, And web design. Then on Tuesdays and Thursdays i have Com225 (intro to interpersonal communication) i really like this class, i have it from 10:20 to 11:40 and its taught by 2 professors that are married, steve and kelly. they are so engaging and are really cool and interesting people. then from 12:40 to 2:30 i have ISS210 (society and the individual) i really like the professor in this class too, he's very versed on the information he teaches, but you really have to pay attention to catch everything he says. its not like in highschool where you can just do the work and in the process you'll get the material, you have to be the one to motivate yourself to go to class and listen and thats how you'll understand the material. then i have Yoga from 4:10 to 5:00. 14 credits isn't too overwhelming i would say, its keeps me busy for the first half of the day, then i really have the rest of the day to do all my work and other extra-curricular activities., 171561=Michigan State is going through a remodeling process with many of the dorms around campus so the quality of living is much higher. The building I am living in was remodeled in 2011 and I love it. Most sophomores preferred to live in this building because it was more convenient than living in apartments., 202325=Apply Early! There's nothing better than feeling the stress and anxiety of the college applications process being over. It's also beneficial to you as a student to apply by the first week of November because MSU is really good about responding promptly. I received my acceptance letter within 3 weeks and it was great to know that I am already getting into schools!}",
