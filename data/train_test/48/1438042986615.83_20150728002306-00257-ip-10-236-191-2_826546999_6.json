Applications must be filled out\u00a0completely\u00a0andcorrectly\u00a0or they will be returned to you. Having your application returned for further information delays contact with the admissions offices of your target schools. Pay particular attention to the required one page personal statement. If you chose to participate in the committee interview process, you have already received formal feedback - be sure to revise your personal statement essay! Have someone else assess your essay (i.e. Career Center staff, Writing Center, etc.) after your revision. Remember that you are trying to sell yourself to an admissions committee.

Schools consider both your science GPA and your cumulative GPA, so it is not wise to prioritize your grades in science courses over those taken for your general education requirements. Start early.\u00a0Identify 5-8 schools of potential interest before registering for classes in the spring of your SOPHOMORE YEAR. The courses listed above are common to many allopathic schools, but there may be additional requirements for the schools you are interested in. It is best to know about those requirements while you still have room in your schedule to fulfill them. \u00a0How can I locate the allopathic program that is best for me? Yes.
