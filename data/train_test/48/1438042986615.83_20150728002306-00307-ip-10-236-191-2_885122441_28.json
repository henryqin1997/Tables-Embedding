If you are looking for a cheap good school, go here!, 414518=The classes are not expensive at all you can take 3 classes, including books for less than $1000., 619679=Lone Star is an amazing school to attend. The teacher, student ratio is about 1:20 . Beautiful campus., 215925=We have a Fall Fest in October. Student wear costumes, there are activity booths, food, & rides., 1099819=Very safe aside from a few weird incidents in 2013. I have never had any trouble., 1082424=Great for students with limited means of paying for college (tuition is about 1200 a semester), disabled students, students who need to develop their academic skills, older students looking to go back to school, and people looking for workforce degrees., 603623=This campus might be unusual to see several adult students at night classes. (6:00 - 9:00 PM), 772742=Like I said before, LSC is for students who want to save money, or for those who feel like they don't have enough money for a college education. You spend about $700-1000 for 12 credit hours including all the fees and then about $200-500 for books and supplies (varies). And if you qualify for financial aid then it covers all your costs for classes and books. (This is a good way to save than spending over $40,000 for the first 2yrs of a university education)., 64844=i\u2019ve been greatly attracted to the idea of attending lonestar college ever since i went to the north harris campus in woodland. last october, mom and i went to lonestar college cyfair campus talked to our representatives there. a close friend of mine and her mother also visited lonestar last spring and spoke highly of the exquisite beauty of the campus which sits on top of a ridge surrounded by the many small lakes, a different but appealing kind of terrain for me. they enjoyed the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff and students whom they encountered and the smallness of the classes they attended. they were also impressed with how clean the campus appeared. though my friend will remain in lonestar for her college experience, i want to attend college in a different state, a new place altogether for me. i feel that sam houston college and university houston college is where i belonged, since i'am major in computer science. i choose to agree with the lonestar college. i don\u2019t want a direct popular election because i want the smaller states to still have a voice, but, if america switches to direct popular election, the way things are, might just go worse. there are some good reasons for a direct popular election, and there are not good reasons for one too. i like the lonestar college a lot, and i would like the voting system to keep it that way. however, the lonestar college, being the geniuses they are, created a good places to study that would not cause any noices or any sounds that can affect our study time. one reason i choose to stay with the lonestar college is that there are many campus where i can selects, many campus i decided to go to, it will be cost the same as much as the campus which i currently attended . take arnold schwarzenegger for instance, he was a famous movie star years ago and he is now the governor of california. i believe that he only won because he being famous. if we take away the lonestar college and replace it with many others college, we could have save whole bunch of money. that way, the money that we have already saved, we could use that to get onto big big university and when i mean big. its mean the university that can train you good. there will be alot of people whos going to do my way because of not knowing what they are doing, and not knowing what they want to do with their life is going to waste of a lot of money over taken classes that are not important just only throw money away because of not knowing what they major in. by going with lonestar college, first can save you tons of money. second , it can get you through with all your basic classes english, goverment, us history, and others elective classes. third, it can prepare you before the big thing comes which is university., 20198=Starting college at the age of 16 was a little daunting; after all, from sixth grade on, I was homeschooled, which was great. I received a terrific education from my mother, as well as other teachers in homeschool co-ops. However, by the time I reached my senior year of high school, I had taken all of the classes necessary for a high school diploma, but neither my parents nor I were ready for me to attend a university. The solution was Lone Star College, which has enriched my education by enabling me to learn from outstanding professionals, preparing me for a university setting, and helping me create lasting relationships with other students and staff. Before I started my first semester at Lone Star in Fall 2008, my parents presented me with an interesting financial aid offer. They agreed to pay for my classes and books as long as I made As; any other grade would result in me having to pay them back for the class. Thus far, I\u2019ve only made one B; but my success can be attributed a great deal to the outstanding teachers at Lone Star. I have taken several classes in which I would have made significantly lower grades had it not been for the additional time and tutoring provided by professors. Had I taken those classes at a university, I likely never would have had the opportunity to receive one-on-one private help from a professor in order to excel in a class. But at Lone Star, every professor I\u2019ve had has taken a personal interest in my education. They truly want students to succeed, whether they\u2019re working toward an associate\u2019s degree or planning to transfer to a larger university. When I transfer to a university in Fall 2010, I will take along many excellent habits that formed as a result of my experiences at Lone Star. One of the best preparational tools Lone Star provided me was new student orientation. I went in expecting to hear about how great Lone Star College was; instead, I received excellent information about how to succeed at the college level. I was told about the importance of going to class, getting to know my professors, and getting involved on campus. In five semesters of school, I\u2019ve only missed one day of class, and I let my professor know in advance that I would be absent. I have made it a point to privately meet every professor I\u2019ve taken during office hours, and they have always been accommodating and helpful, whether I needed tutoring or advice on my future educational goals. Additionally, I\u2019ve attended a number of free seminars, made great use of the math lab, and become an officer in Phi Theta Kappa, all of which has contributed to my education. I have not just attended Lone Star, I have received an outstanding education that has prepared me for success at the university level. Classroom learning and good study habits aren\u2019t the only things I will take with me from Lone Star as I continue my education. I have developed wonderful relationships with many of the professors and administrators, many of whom have written letters of recommendation to assist me in obtaining scholarships and acceptance to a university. I believe these are people with whom I will have a relationship for the remainder of my life because I had the unique opportunity of getting to know them in a smaller, more intimate environment, and they were invested in my success. I also have developed close personal friendships with people from all walks of life. I\u2019ve learned to appreciate people\u2019s differences, opinions and personalities, and I will continue relationships with many of these people long after I leave Tomball. Without question, as I one day think back over my educational experiences, I will consider attending Lone Star College one of my best decisions. The community college experience has helped me grow and mature, both personally and scholastically. It enabled me to learn how to become a successful college student, and I developed relationships that will positively affect me for the rest of my life., 1106599=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 264770=Understand your rights and responsibilities under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. To plan ahead for a smooth transition, meet with the Learning Disabilities Specialist before classes begin to submit documentation and arrange academic accommodations. Also, Be sure to register for classes as early as possible--you'll get the pick of the best times and best classes., 967932=Going to a community college is certainly way less expensive than first going to a university because you do not have to pay for living expenses and other things, only tuition. For only taking 12 hours, one could pay less that $1000., 9917=I took three classes my first semester in college in the fall of 2009. I took Spanish 2402, English 1301, and History 1301. Yet the classes were hard in a since of you had to work for your grade unlike high school, the teachers helpped you through out the entire way with small classes., 472200=October Fest., 759671=They have 7 campuses around Houston, they are also opening a new location this fall 2013. Make sure you search which one is closest to you!, 599537=May clubs meet. It is also fun to just hang around campus and meet new people.}",

There are some absoulutely amazing teachers here, but one or two that you should avoid at all costs. Bang for the buck Unbeatable prices! Defeinetely reccomend anyone to take first 2 years here, and this is the main reason. Am enjoying being here A nice campus, but can't wait to transfer to a full 4 yr college. Am learning a lot I've taken some great College Level courses here, in a small, (mostly) student friendly environment.
