    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{24764=I have a memory of late in 2011 Henry started looking very good and it continued into the first month of 2012. He started looking good when he faced Joey Votto with the tying run on base. He struck him out for the third out. H-Rod walked off the mound with his feet seemingly never touching the ground and a smile so big it looked like someone had sewed his lips to his ears when Davey came out of the dugout to shake his hand.Honestly, how many intentional walks have you seen this team give since Davey's been at the helm? We've got the staff that can pitch to almost anybody in most situations., 19101=On May 20th the Nats will have a 34 year old that has had two serious wrist injuries to the same wrist? So, I assume you believe that Mark Texiera will be back to his old self May 1st? He's only had one injury to that wrist. Similarly Curtis Granderson? You might be setting yourself up like Humpty Dumpty Njack., 103298=Indeed, I believe that the Nats went 21-33 against the Marlins from 2010-2012. The Marlins' overall record during those seasons (in order from 2010-2012) was 80-82, 72-90, and 69-93. Not exactly world-beaters but they were certainly Nats-beaters.NatsJack in Florida said\u2026 Candide\u2026the Fish stunk last year but still managed to play .500 ball against the team with the best record in baseball. And when the Nats almost played .500 ball the year before, they killed the Nats. April 04, 2013 7:32 PM, 127018=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC. Images provided by Getty Images. Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 77595=Section 222 said\u2026 A. Soriano had a bunch of outfield assists when he was here because people were running on him as much as they could. But the idea that he was \"patrolling\" any position is kind of funny.Are you thinking of Nook Logan or something? April 04, 2013 8:48 PM _____________________________________I agree on Soriano. He threw out a lot of baserunners but his other fielding skills were not great., 37191=Peric, Nyjer was a star in 2011 in Milwaukee. He wears out his welcome quickly. Rubber arm and poor reads on balls and horrific against LHP.Denard Span hits all pitchers, has a good arm, and is a top fielder with very good reads., 114710=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows. Here's the 2015 schedule (subject to change)... MON: 12:45 p.m. TUE: 2:30 p.m. WED: 4:30 p.m. THU: 2:30 p.m. FRI: 5:30 p.m. SAT: 10:30 a.m. *All times Eastern. You can also listen to the station on 94.3 FM, 92.7 FM and online at ESPN980.com. Click here for past audio clips., 69339=Peric, Soriano was a left-fielder in 2006. Try again.Harper could be better still.Marlon Byrd wasn't bad and later became an All Star. Jose Guillen was pretty good as was Alfonso Soriano. Picking Span as the best CF yet is pretty ridiculous since its only been 3 games. You might as well say Ben Revere is the best CF the Phillies have ever had since he beat Span out for that job., 97157=peric said\u2026I will say unequivocally that Denard Span is the best center fielder that the Nationals have had since they got to DC.<Better than Soriano? I think not. And the jury is out dude. IMO Ankiel was the best fielder they've ever had out there. Period. End of story. The jury is out as to whether Span generates enough OBP to offset the loss of a guy who has already hit 4 home runs? Let's compare those two shall we?C'mon I've been watching this team longer than you have Joe Seamhead.

This reminds me of a song by Jerry Jeff Walker called \"Pissin' in the Wind\"Incidentally, I started going to Senators games at Griffith Stadium, and went to the very first Nats game in Philly, saw Del Unser throw out the first pitch. As I said, whatever.April 04, 2013 8:59 PM \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 peric said\u2026Sorry Del Unser never played in Griffith stadium. Maybe you were thinking of Harmon Killebrew?April 04, 2013 9:01 PM\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-From there you were just digging your hole deeper. When did I infer that Unser played in Griffith Stadium?You made the comment that you had been watching this team longer then me. I'm confused as to how that's possible, as I was there in Philly, in 2005, at CBP when Del Unser threw out the ceremonial first pitch. BTW, Soriano, after reluctantly switching from 2nd Base, moved to Left field where most knowledgable baseball people never saw him as elite defensively. Regardless, he never played centerfield for the Nats as you claim., 90243=peric, if you knew so much about the Nats as you say you woildld know that Del Unser threw out the ceremonial first pitch for the Nats very first game 2005 in CBP in Philly., 74643=djinFl. said\u2026 Gonat, you almost gat a weekends worth of drinks on that one. Luckily I knew I was slow on soriano in centerfield so I didn't post April 04, 2013 8:50 PM _______________________________Hah! I did good there. I just can't believe how poor Peric is on Nats history. Not even 9 full years yet!, 64825=Peric, Soriano was a left-fielder in 2006. Try again.Bryce Harper was the best CF the Nats had to date.}",
