By Niyantha Shekar TCM July issue, 37797=A graduate of Cranleigh School, in 2003 he won the Telegraph fast bowling award, the Channel 4 outstanding team player award and the AA Thompson fielding award. He finished his school career by winning the EW Swanton cricket prize and within a fortnight of leaving he received an England Under-19s call-up, having played some pre-season friendlies for Surrey. He made his Surrey debut as a 19-year-old in 2008 and had a spell in grade cricket that winter in Sydney, returning in 2009 with better accuracy to join his pace. Meaker was also the first recipient of the ECB's Harold Larwood Fast Bowling Scholarship to Australia and despite struggling, with the rest of his team-mates, in 2010 made an excellent start to the 2011 season. His efforts bore fruit when he made his debut for England Lions against Sri Lanka A that summer and he was then capped by England in the ODI series in India at the end of the season., 38756=Although he continued to interest England, playing in two T20s at the end of another India tour in 2012, his progress has been undermined by injuries and a tendency to deliver too many four-balls striving for extra pace. But his penchant for devastating spells remains, and there are few comparable talents on the county circuit. ESPNcricinfo staff, 62617=4391 runs after 35, and 2354 outside top five, 67606=4391 runs after 35, and 2354 outside top five (43), 37252=Pietermaritzburg-born and raised before his family moved to England in 2001, Stuart Meaker has made big enough strides at Surrey to win fleeting international recognition. With a short run-up and low trajectory, he is reminiscent of Simon Jones at the bowling crease. Like Jones, Meaker has attracted plenty of attention for the pace he generates and though rumours that he was clocked at 96mph may be overcooking it, he is certainly fast., 66694=Since the beginning of 2012, Ian Bell averages 34.69 when batting in the top six; among regular top-order batsmen, only Shane Watson has a lower average, 43817=Jul 24, 2014, 42917=Jul 27, 2014, 42178=Apr 13, 2015, 12784=Born January 21, 1989, Pietermaritzburg, Natal, South Africa}",
