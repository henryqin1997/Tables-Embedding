Usually, after a winning home game, the student section will sprint across campus and run through the two fountains in celebration. It is especially great on hot days in august and september! Also, you have to make a stop at the discount den and buy a den pop (yes, we call it pop, not soda). A den pop allows you to mix different drinks together, all for a cheap price., 886002=There are over 1000 clubs on campus, I'm sure you can find something!, 168321=Definitely take a tour. This lets you get a feel for the dorms and how far they will be from your classes. If your from out of state, definitely ask about the weather. Several of my friends had to make emergency trips to Walmart because they didn't have any winter clothing. If you can, try leaving your winter clothes at home for the warm months, and then switching your wardrobe over a break, so that you don't bring more clothes than you have room for, because you won't need that cute turtleneck sweater in August., 1103428=When you apply, be creative and be yourself. Apply by November 1st so that you can be considered for Scholarships and Honors College., 124742=Friday night's before home football games there is a walk with the team over the bridge . The marching band plays for the crowd as they march through the campus before each home game ., 152267=Do not schedule classes before 8:30 am ever and meet as many people as possible. There are 20,000 different students at Purdue, surely there is someone that you can connect with and friends make the experience that much better!, 877891=Try and really reach out during BGR, but don't feel bad if you don't click with the people from your group! My best friends were ones that I met through my roommate. Also, if you want to get an apartment, sign in October to get the best choice! We signed early November, and we were almost too late!, 856517=I've only been there once, but it was a fun experience. I learned a lot about Purdue, and may attend this coming fall of 2013., 435076=hanging out with friends are always great, going to the union is a good option. you can bowl or play pool, or simply just have a cup of coffee and chat with friends. the new gym will be completed in the fall of 2012, so you will have a great new place to workout and play sports. joining a club is always a good idea, there's no better way to meet other people who likes what you like too., 1082302=Very safe environment. Police officers are always around. Here is Purdue 2012-2013 Annual Security Report: http://www.purdue.edu/police/pdf/YourCampus.pdf, 746097=With almost 1000 clubs to join Purdue is the place for working out and having fun. JThey also just built a new recreation center as well which boasts a ton of sporting facilities and equipment. There is always something to do at Purdue in the fun sense., 694910=I've walked around at 3:30 am and felt perfectly at home.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Make sure you go to all of your classes. Many professors will give extra credit points or actual points for good attendance. Most of your classes will not have a lot of homework and only a few tests so every point you earn is important. There are rarely any easy points in college. Set aside time to study each week, that way you won't panic when the tests come around. For many of the harder classes, it is recommended to begin studying for test AT LEAST a week in advance. Don't procrastinate or you'll be very sorry when the grades come out at the end of the semester. Also, try to get involved around campus. This helps you make friends and will look good on future resumes. Also, having some good friends will help you get through your first year. Go home as little as possible. Several people I know went home to visit their boyfriends almost every weekend during the school year. These people now have few to no friends at school. The best time to bond with your new friends and meet even more new people is during the weekends. If you go home all the time you will have a lot of trouble in the long run with loneliness because of this. Tough it out for a few weeks because I guarantee you'll be grateful you did by the end of the year. College is where",
