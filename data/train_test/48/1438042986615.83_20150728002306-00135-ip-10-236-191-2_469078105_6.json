    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes Although preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described in the foregoing detailed description and illustrated in the accompanying drawings, it will be understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiments disclosed, but is capable of numerous rearrangements, modifications, and substitutions of parts and elements without departing from the spirit of the invention. Accordingly, the present invention is intended to encompass such rearrangements, modifications, and substitutions of parts and elements. To use the Doppler guided electrode, the signal processing electronics and current stimulator circuitry are connected to the base of the trocar through a wire harness. The needle guide is inserted under the skin and flushed with a conductive solution, preferably 0.9% NaCl solution. The guide is aimed in the direction of maximal doppler signal and advanced toward that signal. The artery or vein in the neurovascular bundle reflects an ultrasound pulse emitted by the crystal which the piezoelectric crystal receives and converts into a voltage difference. The signal processing electronics then convert this voltage difference into a detectable signal. Simultaneously, the nerve stimulator electrode conducts a current through the tip of the guide needle into the surrounding tissue through the electrically conductive solution. Passage of the tip of the needle guide into the neurovascular bundle can often be appreciated by an abrupt, short high frequency doppler signal. The intensity of this signal is enhanced by the use of \"B\" bevel pointed",
