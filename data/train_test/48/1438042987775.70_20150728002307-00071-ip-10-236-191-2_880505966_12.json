            "If considering their MSW program, take into consideration that you're classes will all be at the downtown center and that this is designed for someone who has NO previous social work experience.",
            "I felt like the student center, the activities on campus, the health center, the on campus organic grocery store, and the late night events made the campus a pretty good buy. Parking passes for the semester can get expensive, but the college is fairly cheap tuition wise. The class sizes can get pretty large in 100-200 level classes: 150 or more students.... So it's up to you whether you think that's a deal or not.",
            "I was one of the first students to utilize the new downtown center for 95% of my classes. At the time I was a student there they most certainly didn't have the bugs out of coordinating the downtown center. My degree program was only one of I think 4 that was present in this building....considering that and the fact that it was a couple miles from the main campus it felt pretty alienating. I also felt a little bit threatened by the surrounding neighborhoods around the downtown center. I was an off-campus housed student, so parking downtown near the center was awful. They had very limited gated parking, and no good backup plans for the 100+ students that couldn't fit into the gated lot. This meant a lot of walking through shady areas to finally make it to the campus. To give them credit, they did have one security escort, but they would only walk you 3 blocks away from the school and then you're on your own. There is a shuttle bus that runs every 30 minutes most days back to the main campus....so on campus students definitely will find it safer and easier to get to the downtown center. I felt the classes were ok....I had a mix of great professors, so-so ones, and terrible ones. I did sense a disorganization of my classes since my program (Human Development) was brand new.",
            "My program: HDEV (Human Development) was brand new. I felt that I learned a little bit about everything, but not enough about anything. It was too broad. I think this degree doesn't even exist anymore, so no worries about following in my footsteps..... If it's helpful, I'm 4 years from my graduation, and I was never able to find a job....I didn't have a specific enough skill set and enough internship experience."

However, do NOT pack too much clothes! You simply do not need too many outfits. Also, do go overboard buying any school supplies before you get to the school, depending on your classes, all you might need is a pen, a pencil, a folder, and loose-leaf paper. Additionally, be wary of your meal plan allowance, because even though you are billed around $2000 for the year, you are only allotted $800 in the Fall and then the other $800 in the Spring. Don't go spending too much money on groceries available in the school with your meal plan, instead go to Walmart or Target! Finally, always go to class of course! The amount of freedom you have distorts your perception of reality, and soon enough, your coursework will catch up with you and you will have many sleepless nights catching up! Most importantly of all, make friends of course, and enjoy your stay at Binghamton!, 210965=The best place to live on campus now is in the Newing Community. It just opened in 2011 and it's definitely the most comfortable place to live on campus in terms of the buildings and rooms and the dining hall. Its also pretty close to the Union. The school is still adding new buildings to Newing. Mountainview is the next nicest place to live on campus, its fairly new but not the best in terms of location. Hinman is great for the super studious because it's close to the lecture hall and library. Dickingson and College-In-The-Woods are alright., 458343=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 451287=If you don't like winter or cloudy days, I suggest you go to another school. I love summer a lot and enjoy sunny warm days, and Binghamton weather is definitely the opposite of my preference. There is usually sun and shine the first month and half of school (end of August to mid October) and last months of school (end of April to mid May). Every other month is full of rain, cloud days, and snow. Definitely bring boots and a super warm jacket. It's always brick cold weather here after October., 430692=Disclosure: This reviewer is an adjunct faculty member (since 1997) as well as a student in one of the PhD programs. However, this reviewer attended BU in 1976 as a transfer student (dropped out in senior year) and again in 1984 completing both UG and MS by 1989. This is one of the top 100 schools in the country. It promotes research at the UG stage which provides practical experience desired by employers. Students can earn post-graduate degrees; some programs combine UG and Grad degrees reducing the time to earn both degrees., 58549=Prepare to study! I maintained a good average and got a 2280 on my SAT--never studied, never had a tutor all through highschool. Now, I study all the time! The professors expect you to keep up your end of the deal., 193901=I know a number of students who attend Binghamton, and I know that this school has a ton to offer a student in terms of academic, extracurricular, and career opportunities. The campus is well-kept and the student population is diverse. These are only a few of the reasons I chose to transfer to Binghamton for the Fall 2013 semester., 253667=Visited SUNY Binghamton in November and LOVED the campus. Also, the town of Binghamton itself seems very friendly and inviting. Definitely my first choice school., 156773=Here in Binghamton they're residential communities. Communities are Hinman, Dickinson, Newing, Mountain View, Susquehanna, and Hillside. The last two mentioned are apartment style residence, which is only available to upperclassman. Hinman, and Mountain View are suite style. Dickinson, and Newing are corridor style. Mind you, they are constructing a new Dickinson, so it will be brand new for incoming students during the 2013 year. Newing and Mountain View are new as well, and Hinman will be the oldest yet most social of the communities here in binghamton,.}",

As a engineering student, I am always busy with school work or clubs. It really is important to balance studying and leisure time but once you get the hang of it, SUNY Binghamton is great! Bang for the buck This is a premier state university, I think the tuition price isn't good but isn't bad either but of course it'd be great if college was free... =] Am enjoying being here I adore dorming on campus because you basically live with your classmates/friends. You can eat together, hangout with each other and I must say you will never be bored. Freshmen aren't allowed cars on campus but there are free shuttle buses that",
