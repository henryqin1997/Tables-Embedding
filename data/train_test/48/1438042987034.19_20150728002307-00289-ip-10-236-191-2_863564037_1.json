The building had been in planning since 1911; various obstacles, including World War I, held up progress. Construction began in 1917 from a 1908 design by Horace Trumbauer in the Classical Revival style, probably influenced by recent trips to France by the African American architect Julian Abele, the chief designer of Trumbauer's firm.[5][6] In addition to being the main library, the building serves as the system's administrative headquarters., 12584=In March 2011, the library launched Free Library Hot Spots, placing new computer labs and computer trainers in existing community centers in low-income areas of the city. The initiative is funded by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program. Each Hot Spot provides computers, internet access, printers, and a small selection of Free Library materials. (These are in addition to the 950 public-access computers and free WiFi throughout the Free Library's 54 branches.), 13895=According to a study conducted by Penn\u2019s Fels Institute of Government, in 2010 nearly 25,000 people learned to read or taught someone else to read solely because of the resources of the Free Library. In addition, nearly 1,000 people found jobs based on the career resources of the Free Library, and some 8,600 entrepreneurs were able to start, grow or improve their small businesses because of programs and resources available free of charge at the Library.[11], 16125=In 2013, the Rosenbach Museum & Library became a subsidiary of the Free Library of Philadelphia Foundation. It retains its own board and is managed separately from the public library system.[12], 17916=Many of these libraries were funded by Andrew Carnegie, who donated US$1.5 million to the library in 1903.[13] The Bushrod Library was also established in 1903 through a bequest by Dr. Bushrod James.[14], 6507=The Free Library of Philadelphia was chartered in 1891 as \"a general library which shall be free to all,\" through efforts led by Dr. William Pepper, who secured initial funding through a $225,000 bequest from his wealthy uncle, George S. Pepper. However, several libraries claimed the bequest, and only after the courts decided the money was intended to found a new public library did the Free Library finally open in March 1894. Its first location was three cramped rooms in City Hall. On February 11, 1895, the Library was moved to the old Concert Hall at 1217-1221 Chestnut Street. Library officials criticized their new home as \"an entirely unsuitable building, where its work is done in unsafe, unsanitary and overcrowded quarters, temporary make-shifts.\" In December 1, 1910, the Library was moved again, to the northeast corner of 13th and Locust Streets.}",
