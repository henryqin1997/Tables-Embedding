            "I've never felt safer at a university. Although the campus is huge and situated in a dangerous neighborhood, the security is fantastic. There are distress beacons that you can use almost everywhere on campus in case you ever feel threatened. There are also multiple security offices around that you can go to. CSULB also offers to drive you to your car at night so that you never have to go alone. The security is fantastic, and I've never once felt like I was in any sort of danger.",
            "I didn't rush this semester, sadly, but I've heard it's all good fun.",
            "Though I haven't been very involved in clubs at Long Beach because of my commute, I've looked around during registration days and there is an incredibly diverse bunch of clubs to join. I also experienced a variety of different cultures just by walking through the registration tables, as there's a club for almost every single culture you can imagine. You'll never feel too far away from home at Long Beach, and you certainly won't ever get bored.",
            "I know this will sound a tad cliche, but any and all. I've talked to kids who didn't do so hot in high school and kids who did excellently, and everyone seems to fit right in at this school. You're not going to be able to skate by in most classes though, so come prepared to work. Also, if you're big on the typical Southern California weather, then this is the place for you. There's a beautiful outside campus that's just filled with nature and sunlight.",
            "The campus is littered with very interesting locations all around. There's a giant bell tower that actually has no bell, but that sometimes plays music randomly throughout the day. There's also a very odd, metallic structure that was actually created as a piece of art meant to represent a whale's tail fin. These sorts of spots are all over the campus; you just need to know where to look!",
            "For all the education I've received so far the financial burden has been completely manageable. I don't live on campus and that certainly helps the situation as tuition costs are particularly low, but after looking up the cost for room and board I would say that's not too stressful either, especially compared to other schools.",
            "The campus is beautiful and there's always something going on, from live music to a variety of different clubs. There's a brand new recreations center with an amazing amount of equipment, but if you're looking for something a bit less physical there's a game lounge where you can play billiards, video games, or even bowling. There's never a lack of things to do at CSULB.",
            "Cal State Long Beach has a great selection of foods from personal school restaurants to a food court including places like Carl's Jr., Subway, and Panda Express. The wide variety of food is always welcomed by everyone I know.",
            "I live at home, so I'm not exactly sure how the Dorm Life at CSULB is, but of the friends I've talked to, it's every bit as much of the college experience as any other school.",
            "As someone who was an all-AP kid in high school, I've felt CSULB to be a bit lacking in academic rigor. Perhaps most of this can be contributed to the fact that I've only been in General Education classes thus far, but the workload has never been too stressful. With more advanced courses, I would imagine the rigor will greatly increase.",
            "Come in with an open mind. I always worried that maybe Long Beach was beneath me as a school because I never thought it had a great reputation, but it's actually a great school with quite a lot to offer if you only give it a chance. Don't be down if you're going here and it wasn't your first choice: you'll see that it's just as good as whatever your first choice was!",
            "CSULB is a beautiful campus with a lot to offer a wide variety of people. As someone who originally went in with a very closed mind on the school, I'm happy to say that its environment has been healthy, welcoming, and challenging. CSULB has helped me to narrow down my focus in life while also managing to keep from being financially burdensome."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{579638=The campus is beautiful, and HUGE. They are incredibly impacted, and aren't accepting ANY applications for Spring of 2013. Seems like a good school., 249654=It depends who your teacher is . Some teachers don't really care about your grades so it your responsibility to ask other people you know at the school such as friends or family members and see if they are good teachers. Also they are trying to change a lot of things for the next incoming freshman's of Fall 2012 which will make it more difficult to receive scholarships. As long as your grades in High School Are Good, Your Straight., 1114968=CSULB has one of the most diverse and well-rounded campuses. For Fall 2014, our university was the #1 most applied to school in California! There are so many clubs, organizations, and opportunities to become involved that you will always feel at home at CSULB., 1063889=I got into every school I applied to, even some Ivy's. I chose CSULB because of its prestige and mainly its cost effectiveness. CSULB has been named among \u00e2??America\u00e2??s Best-Bang-for-the-Buck Colleges\u00e2?? in a new list released Aug. 26 by the Washington Monthly. It does the best job of helping non-wealthy students attain marketable degrees at affordable prices.\u00e2?? CSULB appears at No. 6 on the list of colleges and universities from across the country., 732751=Make sure to have at least a 3.0 gpa and/or 1300 on your SATs this school is one of the harder CSUs to guarantee admission., 25378=The food and dining services at California State University Long Beach provide students with an excellent variety of places to eat at. The Nugget Grill and Pub, located near the Bookstore, is an excellent restaurant that offers popular sport games on a big screen television for all students, it has the best turkey burger and provides students with the perfect social ambiance. During the 2010 FIFA world cup, student flocked The Nugget to watch Spain and Netherlands fight for the gold cup. Then there is The Outpost, a delicious restaurant to attend if you need to grab a quick bite before class. Located near the Engineering and Journalism buildings, it provides students with affordable fast food such as pizza, sandwiches and salad. Adjacent to the Outpost is a small convenient store that has all the necessities a student needs such as food, refreshments, scantrons, pencils, pens, paper, etc. A favorite coffee shop among all students is Starbucks, which is located in the library. Known as one of the best coffee shops around the world, it serves all the students at my university who need a quick wake up before class or even after a long day of studying. Affordable coffee for coffee lover and addicts, it is definitely one of the best places to grab a delicious coffee on campus. I give my university five stars because of the affordable prices, delicious food, and excellent services., 4351=I enjoy CSULB. The students are all pretty chill (for lack of better terms) and there are many diverse food venues. Every Wednesday at noon bands play near the Union Center. There are movie screenings every two weeks and a Student Rec. and Wellness Center will be finished in fall 2010 (rock climbing wall, beach vollyball courts, yoga/fitness classes, pool, indoor track, workout machines, juice bar... yata yata). Plus its close to the beach and downtown Long Beach where there is always something going on., 844368=The academic level seems to be very advanced and the program I'm planning on attending in spring 2014, looks really qualified, so I'm sure that I could become a better psychologist at CSU, compared to the study in Denmark, 540394=Long Beach is very affordable for students paying instate tuition. However budget cuts and the new unit cap for the Fall 2012 semester are a huge impact on the school., 1046324=Common joke around campus: Our football team hasn't been defeated since 1991. That's because we have no football team. Baseball is the biggest sport of choice here. Also, if you are looking for a fun fact about Long Beach, the most popular one is that the school has one of three pyramids in the US., 72134=Be sure to look at the General Education requirements and what classes you need for your major. They're important for you to take in order to graduate. Definitely try to see if a class for your major can be considered for GE. Also, see if you have to apply for your degree. Like for film, you have to apply in the January of your second year., 995639=I was a resident assistant for Spring 2013 of my freshman year. This was one of the best decisions I had made, and would do it again. Definitely a place where housing is good., 1141902=The food is better than first anticipated. They are rebuilding Hillside dining hall, so the food should be better in Spring 2015/Fall 2015 at latest. Parkside and Beachside both have good options constantly., 701263=There are several art installations throughout campus, as well as a bell tower with no bell. It rings unusual tunes, and one is never sure what they'll hear. A student swears up and down he heard the Imperial March from Star Wars once.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Extroverts, Surfers, Artsy- people, Partiers, and Socialites. Tips for prospective students Having a car is a really great thing unless your in the dorms. Living off campus is a lot more fun, but VERY ridiculously expensive! You will need a room mate AND a steady pay check! You wont want to ride your bike or walk really that much at all during summer because you will be dripping with sweat by the time you get to class. Some winters it rains like crazy so think about transport or wardrobes! If you are into a laid back beach town and a fun VERY social campus then its a great University! Am enjoying being here About 90% of the students at CSULB are commuters which means they all live in LB or within driving distance. Coming from a town 10 hours away means that connecting and adapting is a lot harder because no one else is really on the same page as you. They have their lives, homes, families, friends, and childhood memories. They don't feel the need to connect or make friends like someone who has nothing or no one within a days drive Am learning a lot",
