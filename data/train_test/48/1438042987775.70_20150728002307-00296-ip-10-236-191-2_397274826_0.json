Applications open in mid-February and close in mid-April. \u00a0, 8942=Welcome to the Division of Communications, Arts and Humanities! Here you will find a broad array of courses that relate and examine the art of human communication. You can study an array of languages (English, ESL, French, German, Russian, Arabic and Spanish) and the current theories of communication (verbal and non-verbal, interpersonal, cross cultural, small group and mass media) that attempt to explain how language and other modalities enable us humans to relate to one another. On the artistic side, we offer courses in the creative and performing arts, art being one of those activities uniquely human. One can study studio art, graphic design, photography, theater and music. As the ancient Roman poet Terrence wrote: \u201cNihil humani mihi alienum\u201d (Nothing human is foreign to me.). In CAH, we study, debate and engage in an unfolding discovery of what it means to be human. We also offer our students and the broader community an arts venue of growing breadth and contemporary invention. The Gallery offers a full range art exhibitions that include student, faculty, alumni, Philadelphia, and national artists. The Gallery also hosts a biennial art exhibition, Articulture. We have a \u201cnew music\u201d chamber music concert series, and students produce major theater productions twice a year. Students are given the opportunity to test their editorial and journalistic skills by contributing to The Communitarian, our student-run newspaper. Then, in April, the Edith Garlow Poetry Prize is awarded, and the College\u2019s student literary magazine, Pegasus, hits the stands. The arts are thriving at the College and will provide you provocative and entertaining reflections on being human.}",
