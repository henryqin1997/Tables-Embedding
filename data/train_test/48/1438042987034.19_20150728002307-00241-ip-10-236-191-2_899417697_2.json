I decided to attend a community college, as a financially smart option, but I found something unique that changed my perspective of education: a vibrant multicultural student community. Today I can proudly say I am a BCC graduate., 259883=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 25047=BCC is one of my best choices i ever made. I am going for general classes than transfer to other school. is cheaper that way cause im only spending 1500 for all my general than spending 8000 just for my general classes in the school I want to go. other than that, the classes is the same like any other college or university. but probably i will change my major and finish in BCC. cause in my situation i can only afford for this college and the habitat is great :)}",
