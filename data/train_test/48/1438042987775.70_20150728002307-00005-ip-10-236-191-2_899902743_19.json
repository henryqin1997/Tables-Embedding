            "You see campus security a lot and after 11pm men on campus have to give their ID to campus security, no one without a Camcard can enter dorms and even commuting Meredith students find that after 11pm their cam cards no longer work.",
            "thankfully Meredith has no Greek life.",
            "There are over a hundred different clubs and activities, everything form the SGA executive board, class presidents to things like anime clubs and angles for autism. Meredith College has a club for your passion and if you don't find one the process of creating a student group is very simple.",
            "Motivated, Curious students. Even young women who find it hard to find their voice will be ale to find their passions and their voice here. Meredith does a fantastic job of getting women comfortable in their own skin and ability to articulate themselves.",
            "Cornhuskin Class Day Stunt CSA Day Crook hunt A performance of Alice in Wonderland every 4 years The Onyx T shirt sales You just have to experience it all to understand.",
            "Worth the money but there are going to be days where you want to transfer.",
            "Hang out with friends, you can rent Wii systems and recreational equipment from the library, along with DVD's there are places across the street to get ben and jerry's icecream, a gaming boutique and of course NC State is a free wolfline bus ride away. There is cameron village (mall) and lots of other places to explore. get a CAT pass from the Cate center and you can ride CAT (Capital Area Transit) buses fro free! Also, Meredith is very close to downtown Raleigh. The possibilities are endless.",
            "Belk Dining Hall (BDH) can be very hit or miss, also watch your plates and silverware, if it doesn't look clean send it back and get anew one. Meredith also had a new initiative about campus sustainability, green takeout trays are given to students to use for take hall food with you . but PLEASE return your dirty ones before you pick up a clean one. the Beehive cafe, located on the second floor of the cate student centers has lots of made-to-order options but there is generally one person behind the grill at a time and it takes longer, but the food is higher quality",
            "The dorms are nice but there are of course occasions where roommates will not get along and if you live near the kitchen, don't be surprised if you hear microwaves slamming at midnight. Some dorms are better then others but that is about the dorm floor culture and not the campus itself. if you find yourself in a dorm where people will dump your laundry out of the machines, contact your RD and/or bail.",
            "It's a women's college but don't let that fool you, were not graduating women with MRS degrees and nothing more. If you try to use lazy high-school tactics you will fail. do the readings talk to professors, uses the learning center, study with others.",
            "You want to find a map of the campus and keep it with you. Make friends with your professors, lots of student working opportunities are found through them and Meredith pays nicely the longer you work as a student on campus. Don't be afraid to run of offices on campus, in your admissions essays or interviews be confidant.",
            "Tradition-rich, No Mean girls style Drama, Academically challenging."

Corn Huskin' consists of immense student involvement in class skits, competitions, games, songs, and a final performance at the end of the week, to which family and friends are invited. This outrageous and thrilling tradition is a fantastic way to get connected with the peers in your class and participate in a little friendly competition. There is so much that goes on during the week of Corn Huskin' that is it difficult to recall all that happens. The summation of the week-long event is fun and interactive for everyone, whether in the audience or in the performances., 43608=I absolutely love the traditions. First there is Cornhuskin which is this big event that happens at the end of October and lasts a whole week. Basically it's a huge competition between the classes this year it was 2013 2014 2015 and 2016. It's so much fun to participate in and so amazing to watch everything come together over the weeks of practicing. Honestly you really just have to experience it. There is also Stunt which is like a field day for our school in the spring. They have a program called the big sis lil sis program where juniors become big sisters to freshman and help and guide them until they graduate. Most girls become best friend's with their big sis I know I have and a lot other girls have as well this one is my favorite tradition. Lastly there is the onyx ring tradition which is where students with 60 credits or more in the fall semester of their junior year get a ring with an onyx stone in the middle of it. This tradition is the big one for most students and they say this is when they really feel unified to the school., 154303=It amazing college; it has been ranked third on the 2013 edition of U.S. News & World Report list of the South\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?s Best Regional Colleges., 188861=Graduated in May 2014 with a BA in Psychology and Minor in Religious and Ethical Studies. Loved the Meredith experience! Student-Teacher ratio is great and the professors are willing to go above and beyond to help you succeed as long as you are diligent and motivated in your endeavor--planning to re-enter and finish my BA in religion!, 170020=Don't worry about not having guys! Some cross register classes at Meredith from local schools like NC State, Shaw, William Peace College and St. Aug. Meredith students can do the same depending on the course., 56360=my daughter is a graduate from 2002. i was so impressed with the atmosphere of the school that i transferred for the education and adventure of this college life.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Hard-working, potential leaders, those not wanting a large university but still desiring some amount of anonymity. Tips for prospective students Many students go home over the weekend, but that doesn't take away from the feeling of community here. The honors program is definitely worth looking into. Bang for the buck As a private college, the tuition is high, but there are many scholarships available to help pay for you education. The technology initiative also helps. You receive a laptop as a freshmen (as long as you are classified as a full-time student), and you turn that laptop in and get a new one your junior year, which is yours to keep upon graduation. Am enjoying being here The community here is excellent. The whole college truly is a sisterhood, and the ring is an excellent way of identifying family you never even knew you had. Also, Cornhuskin' (you just have to experience it!) is a major way that the entire campus comes together. Am learning a lot Don't expect to escape homework just because you escaped high school. Meredith makes you work to learn, and it's",
