            "Incidents do happen here, especially off campus. I do believe that our campus police, though, are very effective. I've had to call them before and they were a great help. Also, there are escort services for if you are afraid late at night about walking across campus.",
            "I was in a sorority and it wasn't for me, but my boyfriend is in a fraternity and I love all the guys in it. The greeks here definitely know how to party, but they are more subdued than you'll find at other schools. Also, you may find some snobby sorority girls here, but not a snobby sorority.",
            "There really is a club for everything here. Some are more active than others, but there are many niche crowds that are represented.",
            "Exercise buffs, aspiring teachers, students who want their professors to remember their names, people interested in other cultures, and creative people - be it in art, writing, or making videos.",
            "We have urban gamers who enjoy Nerf gun fights in our Quad, the occasional farm animal or bouncy house in the middle of campus, and giant round rocks you're supposed to touch for good luck but no one really does.",
            "Definitely a good price for the quality of education you'll receive, along with the amenities you'll have, too.",
            "There are plenty of activities lower classmen can enjoy (we are near Rock Falls and an outlet mall that is great for shopping), but the most popular activity for those over 21 would be on Tuesday night, when the two main bars in town both host their pitcher nights. Good bands, karaoke, and fun all night!",
            "Off campus dining is pretty good. On campus can be a bit expensive and the quality varies.",
            "The new dorms are gorgeous and good for people who consider privacy their most important goal. However, the old dorms are much more social, and although you have to share bathrooms there is much more of a community within them.",
            "Depends on the major and the professor, but there are many well-respected programs at this school. Undoubtedly, though, you'll feel at some point that one or two mandatory classes for your major are useless.",
            "Join an organization, especially one that is related to your major because then you are more likely to stick with it. Also, the Greek system is respected here, and joining a sorority/fraternity or an honorary fraternity related to your major could give you an opportunity to make a lot of friends.",
            "It is a beautiful campus, but famous for snow and rain. It is also a small campus, but full of different activities to join. The school is a community where students and faculty mix, and everyone has an opportunity to succeed at something."

One nice thing about this school is that all of your courses relate in some way. I found myself learning the same concepts, from different perspectives which will help me when I become a teacher., 52924=if you are able to get some college credit courses while in high school, do some sincere community service. if you want to save money wait til may or july to see about getting a new lap top or computer. if they want to offer you to buy microsoft office tell them no thanks. this is why go to microsoft's website and go to their student specials or student section and you can download the full office suite for the special student price also check with your school to see if they have a deal on the office suite, i got mine for a licensed copy from slippery rock university where i am attending classes. if you happen to have a job find out if they offer a scholarship or a grant so ask your managers and research online for the company. bug the heck out of your advisor at your high school, your teachers and anyone else you can think of, you just might get lucky, so be ready to come to sru and get a life experience and make friends for life. good luck, 12538=I'm not a current student at slippery rock yet, but i will be in the fall of 2010 once i transfer there I can tell you more, from what i hear they have great major programs, clubs and organizations that you can get involved in, a small enjoyable town that there's places you can enjoy and other great adventures., 42856=There are many places to eat around campus including Boozel Dining Hall, Rockey's Grill, and new places are being built for the 2012 spring semester. All food is very good., 356936=A lot of event go on oncampus. Many people come for appearances like comedians, tv stars, etc. I met Ross Matthews, Ralphi May, Nev, and others., 533701=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 41449=Slippery Rock has a green and white friday every friday where students wear green and white. Also, during finals week there is breakfast at 11:00 pm at the dining hall where students can relax, dance, and have fun before the stressful week begins.}",

Reviewer has been to campus. 4 out of 6 people found this review useful. 3 of 112 Categories Comments Great for these types of students I looked into slippery rock because its close to home, they have a learning support program for students to get help for their learning disabilitys, there aren't that many colleges that have these type of programs and I myself have a learning disability, I happen to know someone who went here and they said their expeirence from the learning support staff was excellent.
