Take advantage of getting to choose your own schedule don't overwhelm yourself with too many classes. Also, Try taking four classes per semester and one during January or take the whole January month off., 188495=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 155205=This campus has many clubs and organizations that love getting new members. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming. There are also many campus sponsored events. In 2012, the school brough FUN. here for a concert with discounted student tickets. The school is also very close to Chicago so there are many fun options in the city too., 46835=If there is one thing to brag about Elmhurst College, it's their faculty. Since my time here I have not had a problem with any of my professors. All the professor's are extremely helpful and are willing to set appointments with you if you are having a difficult time understanding the material. The typical ratio from professor to student is about 14:1. So if you are a more personal learner and are extremely nervous about attending to a huge lecture hall of about 300 students, Elmhurst College is where you need to be.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck They give a lot of financial aid here there's grants, scholarships, and jobs on campus. You just need to know where to look. After filing your fafsa that's where most of your financial aid comes from. But if you still need to pay money you don't have, you can take out loans or contact the financial aid office and they can assist you with advice on what to do. Compared to other private schools it is a lot cheaper and even more cheap if you commute. Am enjoying being here Honestly, I am not enjoying college as much as I thought I would. Being a commuter makes it difficult to meet people if you don't get involved on campus. Am learning a lot I really am learning a lot in this school. I'm not just learning things for my major but also things that I can apply towards life in general. Going to a liberal arts school helps you learn many things that can used for many majors.
