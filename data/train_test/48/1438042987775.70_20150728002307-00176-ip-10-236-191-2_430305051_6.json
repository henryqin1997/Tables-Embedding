Initially classed as obdurate, like his father, but with a far less unorthodox technique, he started to show the flourishing side to his game after spending a few seasons finding his feet., 37914=He had already been named in an England Lions squad and the chat was increasing that full international honours, especially with the white ball, would not be far away. But he had played the final part of 2013 with a sore back and after he pulled out of the England Performance Programme squad, a stress fracture was discovered. Talk of an England World Cup berth in Australia and New Zealand in 2015 was abruptly stilled, but the Lions wasted little time in evaluating him in 50-over cricket when he returned for Northants midway through the 2014 season, signalling that his potential was still recognised., 37222=A left-handed batsman and left-arm medium-pacer, his bowling really developed during the 2012 season when claimed 43 first-class wickets with his brisk swing and seam. The following summer he was central to Northamptonshire's Friends Life t20 success with a memorable all-round performance in the final; a 19-ball half-century (the fastest of the season), a direct-hit run-out from the deep and a hat-trick to finish off the match as part of a four-wicket haul, not forgetting a slanging match with Jade Dernbach which he partly credited for his inspirational display. It was enough for his captain, Alex Wakely, to label him the 'Northants Botham.', 62488=Since the beginning of 2012, Ian Bell averages 34.69 when batting in the top six; among regular top-order batsmen, only Shane Watson has a lower average}",
