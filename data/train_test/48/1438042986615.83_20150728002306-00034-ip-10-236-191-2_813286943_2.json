The game will take place at The Hawthorns on Saturday August 9th, and the game will kick off at 4pm. This will be the only home friendly of the summer pre season and will be the last match we play before the Premier League season of 2014-15 kicks off properly. Last season Porto were the defending Champions of the Portuguese Primeira Liga, and they finished third behind Benfica and Sporting Lisbon. Striker Jackson Martinez, who fans may know from his World Cup double for Colombia against Japan last Tuesday, scored 29 times for them in their last campaign. With 27 league titles to their name, only Benfica are more successful in Portugal. Ticket details for the match will be announced shortly. Albion's full pre season friendly.
