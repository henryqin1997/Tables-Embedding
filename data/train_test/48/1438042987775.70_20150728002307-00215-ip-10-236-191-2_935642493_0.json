Table 2 we provide a list of presently maintained and commonly used FOSS word processing packages, many of which use the ODT standard by default. In Table 1 ]. The creation of a usable international document standard that is open, free, backwards compatible and fully documented as to ensure legacy archival, is not only in the interest of data archivists, it is key to the conduct of science for the reasons outlined above. In 18 Open file formats, such as the OpenDocument (ODT) format, rely on the input of an international multi-disciplinary consortium of standards organizations, information technology firms and even governments [ ]. In an open system, even end users have the ability to audit the underlying code of FOSS and have the final say on what that software does on their computer at any given time. These same benefits extend to open file formats. 17 Even the development process of FOSS resembles the peer-review process of scientific publishing. A software developer creates a piece of software, releases the source code to the community where other developers contribute improvements or voice their concerns over potential flaws.
