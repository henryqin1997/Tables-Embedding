Apart from the ridiculous scene with Alan and Jake having a fart contest (someone must have watched the Peter/Michael Moore one from Family Guy on YouTube) this was a pretty good episode of Two and a Half Men. The end sequence, while predictable was still a great moment, and the scene with Martin Mull returning as the pharmacist produced about\u00a0eight truly laugh out loud moments. Mull's been all over TV the past few years on Gary Unmarried, Til Death and this program and hopefully he gets some more work next year, with the former two now canceled. It was a nice touch getting a lot of Charlie's past girlfriends for this high sequence. Good way to close out a pretty tumultuous year for the show.moreless thefanof, Jun 05, 2010 By 7.8 gumby with a poker",
