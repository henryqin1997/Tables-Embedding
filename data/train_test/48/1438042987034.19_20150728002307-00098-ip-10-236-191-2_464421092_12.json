This gene functionally complements Chinese hamster irs1SF, a repair-deficient mutant that exhibits hypersensitivity to a number of different DNA-damaging agents and is chromosomally unstable. A rare microsatellite polymorphism in this gene is associated with cancer in patients of varying radiosensitivity. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]}",
