    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{64024=And it's hard to imagine that the Hornets' new owners will be in place by March 23, even if the long-awaited sale of the franchise is as close as Stern has suggested., 61536=You can't like their chances here given J.J. Hickson's season-long struggles, but sources say that the Kings are shopping Hickson hard before the March 15 trade deadline, hoping to salvage something from the last trade consummated before last summer's lockout., 59921=In a West that's so wide-open, Dallas is still a contender to get back to the Finals even after it elected not to re-sign Tyson Chandler and J.J. Barea so it could pursue the likes of Williams and Howard come July. It won't be easy without Chandler and Barea, who'll be missed most in the postseason, but the Mavs have played well enough defensively as a unit without Chandler -- with the ever-versatile Matrix serving as the point man for the Dallas D -- to keep themselves high on the list of teams with the best shot to prevent the conference favorites in Oklahoma City from getting out of the West., 61854=In that swap with Cleveland last June 30, Sacramento surrendered both Omri Casspi and a protected first-round pick for Hickson. But Hickson's game has regressed with the Kings, prompting them to see whether they can find a new home for him., 40205=Sources say that the Lakers are also among the teams that have inquired about Raptors guard Jose Calderon, but Calderon's $9.8 million salary is too big to fit into the Odom exception. And Toronto isn't willing to take any salary back for either Calderon or Barbosa to work a trade otherwise. ... Free agents to watch: James Posey, Eddie House and Michael Finley. None of them have played regular-season games in the NBA this season, so all three would be playoff-eligible even if they sign with a team after March 23. Hard to believe Posey, released in December by the Pacers via the amnesty clause, hasn't been picked up. And Finley was recently summoned for auditions by the Clippers and Suns as he continues to search for one more NBA opportunity at 38. ... Maybe it's not a Wilt-sized anniversary, but few websites (especially in the heart of trade-deadline season) mean more to NBA executives, coaches and players than Spain-based HoopsHype.com, which on Monday celebrates 10 years of operation. ... Looking for your Dwight Howard fix? Worth a read even if you've already read it once: My man Chris Broussard's comprehensive roundup of trade-deadline buzz on our Insider page., 74088=How many times have you heard that the Suns will definitely not deal Steve Nash before the March 15 trade deadline?, 74577=It remains to be seen how willing Nash is to stay after two seasons of steady decline on Sarver's watch since the Suns' Cinderella trip to the 2010 Western Conference finals. The New York Knicks' interest in pursuing Nash as a free agent in the summer is well-documented ... and sources with knowledge of the Dallas Mavericks' thinking say that the defending champs will definitely try to reunite Nash and Dirk Nowitzki in free agency in July if top targets Dwight Howard and Deron Williams elude them. The Toronto Raptors' interest in bringing Captain Canada back home is also well-established., 62784=Which is to say that any player who has played in the NBA this season must be released by March 23 if he wants to be playoff-eligible with another team., 61132=The Mavs clearly believe that they'll have enough time to do whatever they need to do to pursue D-Will and Dwight, which includes releasing Brendan Haywood through the amnesty clause and essentially giving away Rodrigue Beaubois, in June or even July., 70454=Gasol had a clear path to arrive at that position, too. After Kobe Bryant's unsuccessful public plea to management for clarification on Gasol's tenuous future with the Lakers -- claiming that \"it's hard for [Gasol] to kind of invest himself completely ... when he's hearing trade talk every other day\" -- Gasol quickly realized that the Orlando omission would spare him from an exhausting weekend round of media inquisitions into his mental state leading up to the March 15 trade deadline., 72002=Asked how much he's looking forward to March 16, Gasol said: \"When that day comes along and nothing happens, I know for sure I'll have the security that I will be here at least for this season. After that? Who knows? Obviously it'll be an important day in order just to put everything behind me for another month or two or three.\", 63058=If the league-owned Hornets can't find a workable Chris Kaman trade before the March 15 deadline, Kaman would have about a week to secure a buyout and thus be able to sign with another team., 72826=Say this for him, though. Amid all the tension in Lakerland that Bryant was trying to short-circuit with his public show of support for his teammate, Gasol averaged 18 points and 12.2 boards in February., 38724=If the Lakers can't make a splashy move for the elite point guard they crave -- a long shot at best at this point -- and can't swing a deal for top fallback choice Ramon Sessions, taking Hinrich and his $8.1 million salary into their $8.9 million Lamar Odom trade exception is a natural move to give L.A. some semblance of an upgrade in the backcourt going into the postseason., 15766=\"Think about what you just said. There were a lot of things allowed back then that aren't allowed now. How about playing 18 games in 21 days? A lot of things went on back then that wouldn't be allowed today, but you have to understand that the league was in a different place. He followed all the rules he was supposed to follow. They knew that he would get to the game on time. You have to understand that we're talking 1962. There was a lot of that going on back then. For instance, I lived in Newark. If I wanted to go home during the season, I could., 60581=If the Mavs traded Marion before the March 15 deadline, they'd essentially be forfeiting the rest of this season ... with no guarantee that they'll even land Williams. So while it's something of a risk to keep him now -- especially because more than one potential suitor has told me that Marion's play this season and throughout last season's playoff run does have them intrigued -- one source went so far this week as to proclaim that there's \"no chance\" Marion is moved this month., 72400=Which is to say that Gasol is well aware he'll be subjected to renewed speculation about being shopped even if he's still a Laker two weeks from now. After his near-trade to Houston in the collapsed three-team deal from December that nearly brought Chris Paul to the Lakers, it's inevitable that he'll be at the heart of every significant Lakers trade rumor from here., 10859=Fifty years removed from a magic show that came more than four decades too soon for Flip cams and video phones, 21st-century know-it-alls can't wait to tell you how Kobe Bryant's 81 points against Toronto in 2006 were actually gaudier that the untelevised, unfilmed, completely unrecorded damage Wilt inflicted at the Hershey Sports Arena on March 2, 1962., 75230=Sarver, though, is apparently determined to try to persuade Nash to retire in the desert. The thinking there, sources say, is that the Suns believe they'd have a better core going forward with a re-upped Nash, center Marcin Gortat, cap space and a top pick in the well-regarded 2012 draft than with the sort of assets they could bring back now in a deadline deal for a 38-year-old point guard who, even as he continues to play at an All-Star level, is just a few months from free agency., 62610=March 23 has replaced March 1 as a key date for playoff eligibility in this late-starting, lockout-shortened season., 11499=On the 50th anniversary of Chamberlain's historic journey into triple digits -- with the Philadelphia 76ers hosting the Golden State Warriors later Friday and NBA TV ready to roll out its new \"Wilt 100\" documentary narrated by Bill Russell an hour before tipoff -- let's set the mood with an eyewitness account of what happened on the night that has come to define Chamberlain's harder-to-believe 1961-62 season stats., 59360=SI.com's Zach Lowe expertly detailed the Mavs' financial picture for the summer of 2012 earlier this week, but there's one important footnote to add to the discussion: Sources close to the situation insist that the Mavericks are not currently shopping Marion and don't intend to start making Dwight-and-Deron moves until after this season plays out.}",
