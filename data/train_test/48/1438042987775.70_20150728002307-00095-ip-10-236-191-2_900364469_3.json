    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{83422=Young Ross Taylor was once labelled as the brightest Kiwi talent since Daniel Vettori and over time, his potential to be an inspiring captain was noticed by the selectors. A part of the Central Districts and New Zealand's Under-19 sides, Taylor made the transition to the senior Districts team in 2003. His inclusion in the ODI side then came on the back of a successful 2005-06 domestic season where he slammed three centuries. Taylor faced West Indies as he made his mark in international cricket in 2006. Rosco, as he is fondly known, went on to score his maiden century against the Lankans in only his third ODI and followed it up with a hundred against Australia. Late in 2007, he made his Test debut against South Africa but tasted enjoyable success at home against England, averaging over 50. An unbeaten 154 in Manchester was the highlight on the following away tour. Consequently, Rosco was gobbled up by Bangalore in the Indian T20 League, Taylor showed his true colours when his stunning 81 off 33 balls took his side to an improbable win against Kolkata in the second season. He was then bought by Rajasthan in the fourth edition, following which, Delhi signed him in 2012. A year later, Delhi traded him with Pune for Ashish Nehra. With Pune was banned for the 2014 season, Rosco rejoined the Delhi squad for 2 crores. An attacking batsman who is particularly strong on the leg side, Taylor has the special ability to mix offence with defense. A good puller of the ball, his slog sweep also fetches him runs aplenty against spinners. He has also led the Kiwis in ODIs in the absence of their senior skipper, Daniel Vettori. Taylor was then handed full-time captaincy in all three formats after the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup. In spite of some inspiring Test victories under his captaincy, Brendon McCullum was yet again reinstated as captain owing to Taylor's significant problems with the team management. After a brief hiatus from the game during which he missed out on the disastrous South African tour, Taylor came back into the side for the home series against England. He went on to have a successful series at home against West Indies in 2013, where he scored his career best 217 not out and continues to be New Zealand's mainstay in the middle order.}",
