No. 07/935,899, entitled \"Voigt Filter\" filed Aug. 27, 1992 pending., 30486=The laser diodes we use are provided by Spectra Diode, Model No. SDL 5421-G1. The temperature of the diode is regulated by two Melcor FC 0.6-65-06-1 thermoelectric heat pumps. The heat pumps are driven by a Hytek Microsystems HY-5610 thermoelectric cooler controller. The temperature of the laser diode is maintained to within \ufffd0.05\ufffd C. of the required temperature for optimum wavelength stability. The laser diode is driven by a low noise, voltage controlled current source. The current source used to drive the laser diode is one from Industrial Laser Inc., Model LD 1250CC. The laser diode output is collimated with a Rodenstock 1403.108 lens and passes through the Voigt filter. The temperature of the cesium vapor cell is controlled by a Dawn Electronics model DN505 subminiature proportionally controlled heater epoxied to the vapor cell body. The temperature is maintained at 102.5\ufffd to achieve the proper transmission spectrum. The transverse magnetic field of 610 gauss is supplied by two magnets (Dexter Permag #ND35570048) located on either side of the vapor cell. The field is oriented 45\ufffd to the polarization of laser light and 90\ufffd to the beam direction. Corning 900-HC crossed polarizers stop all light which does not have its polarization rotated 90\ufffd within the filter. A CVI PRI-850-20-0537 partially reflective mirror is used to pass 80% of the light incident on it and reflect 20%. A CVI QWPO-850.0-05-2 half wave plate is used to rotate the polarization by 90\ufffd so that the polarization is perpendicular to the long axis of the laser light. This is necessary because a Melles Griot 06-GPA-004 anamorphic prism pair is used to circularize the elliptical laser light. The input of the anamorphic prism pair is Brewsters angle and there would be a 50% loss in light if the polarization were not corrected. A small portion of the laser light is reflected off the input surface of the anamorphic prism pair. An Advanced Photonix SD-1004121231 amplified photodiode is used to detect this reflected light. The signal is used for closed loop control of the laser transmitter output and wavelength.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the above description contains many specifics, the reader should not construe these as limitations on the scope of the invention, but merely as exemplifications of preferred embodiments thereof. Those skilled in the art will envision many other possible variations are within its scope. For example, persons skilled in the art will be able to make changes appropriate for communicating over shorter or longer distances than those referred to in the examples. A smaller network of 11 low earth orbit satellites could provide one band around the earth which would provide communication to and from a large portion of the earth. Full communication networks with less satellites than 66 (for instance 48) are also feasible. Both the beacon lasers and the signal laser beams are not eye safe close to the transmitting unit. This is probably not a problem for transceivers in orbit but could be for other applications. The beacon laser could be made eye safe by expanding the beam to 20 cm diameter before being transmitted. The signal laser could also be made eye safe by expanding it. An alternate approach would be to provide a shutter which is open only when beacon light is being received for the distant transmission. Accordingly the reader is requested to determine the scope of the invention by the appended claims and their legal equivalents, and not by the examples which have been given. Transceiver 2 shown in",
