To mitigate the potential impact of news, we now use only transactions occurring between 10:30AM and 3:30PM each day to exclude possibly news-driven trades. We choose this time window because company news usually arrives in the after-market hours and major economic data are generally released no later than 10AM., 143935=* The numbers of observations for the liquidity measures may be smaller than stated on this line. Data sources: Merill Lynch, Markit, TRACE, Federal Reserve Board, from July 2002 to April 2007., 256261=As shown in Panel A of Table\u00a01 (memo item), the overall sample consists of 1263 unique bonds from 328 firms (identified by unique issuer ticker), with on average nearly 4 bonds per firm. The numbers of bonds and firms vary significantly by bond rating. Slightly over three quarters of the sample are investment-grade bonds, somewhat more than the proportion in the overall corporate bond universe. Also, in term of number of bonds, A- and BBB-rated bonds are by far the most available; AA- and BB-rated bonds come next; and bonds in both tails of the rating distribution (i.e., AAA and CCC/below) are the fewest. In addition, excluding the tails of the rating distribution, the average number of bonds per firm increases in rating, from slightly over 2 for B-rated bonds to about 10 for AA-rated bonds., 166499=We merge this overall sample with the TRACE data to obtain our regression sample. The sampling period is from July 1, 2002 to April 30, 2007. In addition, for bond transaction data, we remove trades with \"data errors\" as in Edwards et\u00a0al. (2007). The figures shown in Panel B reflect the sample of the bonds with at least one non-missing trading liquidity measure for any month (without winsorizing)., 259199=Our overall sample consists of bonds with data available on both bond prices and associated CDS spreads from January 1, 2001 to April 30, 2007. We use this sample to examine the cross-sectional and time-series properties of the nondefault component of yield spreads. To analyze the effect of liquidity on the nondefault component, we further merge the overall sample with intraday bond transactions data from NASD's TRACE (Trading Reporting and Compliance Engine) system, resulting in a smaller \"regression sample.\" Throughout this paper, we conduct our analysis at the monthly frequency, where, unless noted otherwise, the monthly value of a time-varying variable is the average of its corresponding daily values. The rest of this section provides details on our data and sampling method., 236575=Figure\u00a03 plots by bond rating the median values of the monthly nondefault component for the bonds in the overall sample.19 The top panel uses swap rate as the risk free rate. Several points are worth to note. First, as we have seen in the cross-sectional analysis, the nondefault component for BBB-rated bonds, dotted line, was almost always the highest among all rating categories. In addition, it declined notably from about 30 basis points in 2001 to about zero in early 2004 and then trended slightly up since 2006. Second, before 2004, the nondefault component for A-rated bonds, averaging 10 basis points, was generally higher than that for AA-rated bonds, averaging just below zero. However, since 2004, the two series became statistically indifferent; and both trended slightly up since 2006. Third, the nondefault component for speculative-grade bonds appeared to be volatile before 2003, due mainly to the small number of bonds in the early period (from about 10 bonds in early 2001 to about 60 bonds at the end of 2002). Since 2003, it had fluctuated around zero and fallen below zero in 2007., 235289=The time series of nondefault component with Treasury rate, plotted in the lower panel of Figure\u00a03, show similar patterns to those with swap rate, but with two notable differences. First, all series shifted upward; Second, we see more clearly a secular decline in the nondefault components for all investment-grade bonds from 2001 to 2004 and a gradual pickup since 2005., 167153=Our overall sample is constructed by merging Merrill Lynch's Corporate Bond Index Database and Markit Partner's CDS Database for the period from January 1, 2001 to April 30, 2007. We retain only senior unsecured U.S. dollar-denominated bonds issued by U.S. firms that pay fixed semi-annual coupons with remaining maturity less than 15 years. We also delete bonds that are callable, puttable, convertible, or have sink fund features. In addition, to include a reference entity, we require its CDS quotes be non-missing at 1- and 10-year maturities and non-missing at additional two of the four maturities in between (i.e., 2-, 3-, 5-, and 7-year)., 255173=We use intraday transactions data provided by NASD's TRACE to compute measures for corporate bond liquidity. TRACE started to disseminate to the public intraday transactions data on July 1, 2002 for a small number of selected corporate bonds; but the dissemination expanded gradually and began to cover most of the corporate bonds traded over the counter on October 1, 2004 (see Appendix\u00a0A for more details on the TRACE data). The data contain trading information such as transaction price, trading size, settlement date and time. Following the practice in the existing studies using the TRACE data, we remove observations with \"data errors\" (e.g., Edwards et\u00a0al. (2007)).12, 244324=In Figure\u00a01, we show an example of our estimation for Coca-Cola Inc.. On April 30, 2007, the firm has 7 A-rated bonds outstanding, with their remaining maturities ranging from 2.4 years to 14.8 years. Quotes on CDS spreads are available at maturities from 6 month to 15 years. As shown in the top panel, our first step is to add up CDS spread and swap rate, marked as \"O\", and use PCHIP algorithm to fit the CDS-implied par yield curve, the solid line. Typical during this period, Coca-Cola's CDS-implied par yield curve is inverted at the short end of its maturity range. From this par yield curve, we use the standard bootstrap method to derive a zero yield curve, the dash-dotted line in the top panel, and then compute the corresponding discount rate curve, shown in the middle panel. Finally, we use this discount rate curve to price each of Coca-Cola's bonds and compute their corresponding CDS-implied yields. In the bottom panel, we contrast these CDS-implied yields, marked as \"O\", to the actual yields, marked as \"X\". Clearly, the nondefault components of yield spreads, as measured by the difference between \"X\" and \"O\" marks, vary across bonds. Below we examine the statistical properties of such variation with better controlled samples in both cross-section and time-series.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "More details on TRACE rules can be found in NASD (2004). We obtain the publicly disseminated intraday transactions data through MarketAccess. The data include bond CUSIP, NASD composite ratings, transaction price (including the effect of any dealer commission), trade size, settlement time, and other trade related variables. Our data, however, do not have some critical transaction information such as whether the trade was initiated by the buyer or the seller. An additional limitation is that the trade size available in our data is capped at $1 million for high-yield bonds and $5 million for investment-grade bonds for those trades with quantities greater than these limits. Phase III: two stages leading to complete dissemination. On October 1, 2004, about 17,000 bonds were added to the dissemination list, bringing the total number of disseminated bonds to about 21,600. Later on February 7, 2005, all bonds, except the TRACE-eligible Rule 144A bonds which account for about one-sixth of all eligible bonds, became subject to dissemination, bringing the total number of disseminated bonds to about 29,300.22 Phase II: March 3, 2003, the NASD disseminated all investment-grade bonds with original issue size of $100 million or more and rating A3/A- or higher. Subsequently, an additional 120 BBB-rated bonds (40 each for BBB-, BBB, BBB+) were added on April 14, 2003. Total number of bonds subjected to dissemination reached about 5000",

We also remove bonds that appear in less than three months over the sample period.1 For each bond, we then compute means of the relevant variables over the sample period. For this resulting cross-sectional of bonds, we report means of bond spreads, default and nondefault components of the spreads with either Treasury or swap rate as the risk-free rate. (B) * indicates statistically significance at the 95 percent confidence level of a test of the null hypothesis that the nondefault component (in basis point in Columns (3) and (7), and in fraction in Columns in (4) and (8)) is zero. 1 The choice of three months appears to be ad hoc. But the results with more restricted sampling such as by removing bonds that appear in less than 12 months are similar. The results without such restriction at all are also similar except for BB-rated bonds.",
