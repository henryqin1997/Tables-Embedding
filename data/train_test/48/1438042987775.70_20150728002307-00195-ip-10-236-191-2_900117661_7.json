            "There was always alot to do the plaza is walking distance as well as the nelson atkins museum. I enjoyed playing tennis near campus. The recreation center also had fun clubs to join. The kauffmann center was close as well as other local theatres and i love going when i could afford to see a show!",
            "The meal plan was nice to have. It was convenient and there was always a nice selection to choose from. The cafeteria was also a great way to meet new people.",
            "The dorms are very close to the rest of campus which was nice. My roommate experiences were positive and we are still good friends now.We had two people to a room and a bathroom connected two rooms together.I really enjoyed not having a community bathroom and having some privacy. The dorms really helped me meet people and and get settled into a new city.",
            "In the consevatory if you put in your hours practicing it makes the work for many of the classes an easier task. As far as music history classes and gen eds the coursework involves more book work. But if you manage your time well the work is very do-able!",
            "Get things done ahead of time and get organized. If you are looking to be a part of the conservatory you have to be ready to dedicate alot of time to practicing. Scoolwork is important but dont forget about relaxing and having fun it helps after a long day!",
            "I will be starting my sophmore year at umkc this coming fall studying vocal performance and I couldnt be more happy with my choice. I had a great experience my first year, the conservatory has a well rounded program and provides opportunities for performance experience. The professors are always available and willing to work with me when i need an extra boost and the atmosphere is welcoming."

The teachers are said to truly care about the success of the student., 466643=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 77885=The campus is minutes away from the Kansas City Plaza. If you think that's too expensive, there are places with half-prices at happy hour, and $4.50 movies before six. From November through February you can ice skate outdoors downtown Kansas City. The selection of restaurants is amazing. You will find Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Greek, Indian, Italian, Mexican, German, Diners, Fusion, etc. The Art Museum is free. The Zoo is probably 20 minutes or less away. As for art and music, there is a number of venues with great local artists, the Jazz and Baseball Museum, the Blue Room, a new concert hall has been built, the Sprint center has plenty of modern artists showing. If you like to explore and have a car or can make good use of the public transportation, you can find something for you here. Even on campus there is a fully-equipped gym, swimming pool, sauna, and field. The Fine Arts college always have concerts going on whether it is jazz, orchestra, plays, musicals, etc. Movies are played free on campus and STUCO plans fun events as well. For example, in the spirit of Halloween I entered a pumpkin carving contest and costume contest. Keep an open mind and make friends because there are people from all walks of life and religions here., 422563=I visited UMKC on their Preview Day in December, and found their staff to be truly interested in each student's goals for the upcoming years. I have been accepted for the fall semester, and I am looking forward to my time there., 249841=I would say that all the construction and development that has happened over the past three years (and will for the next decade as currently planned) have really proved beneficial and resourceful for students, a lot more so than I had anticipated. The academic departments are all filled with sharp staff and caring professors. The material taught is current and applicable for the present day. They really try to prepare you for a changing world. The university administration could definitely use some attention. There is a lack of communication between themselves and other departments and the university's policies, procedures, and rules are not very clear and vary depending on who you talk to. Student involvement on campus is steadily rising and will continue to do so. The website itself is a maze. Most of the links I click on are outdated and just take me to an error page. Some pages have not been updated since 2007. But overall I loved my experience here. The campus is small enough that you really get to know a lot of people you see on a regular basis and interact with them your entire time here without having to search through crowds to find them.}",

Also good for people who like walking, the school is on a hill. Also, the classes are smaller than the average huge university. There are still a lot of people, but it is not cramped. Tips for prospective students 1-DO NO PROCASTINATE. Trust me, you will regret it. Its still college. 2-Seek help when in doubt. There is a math /science resource center and SI. 3-Just because you can find all your class material online doesn't mean not going to class. Attend as much as you possibly can. 4-Stay involved. Everyone needs something to do besides studying. Trust me, you'd go crazy just staying in your room. 5-Keep track of your grades, that way you can know if you need to pick up the pace, or you can relax. Bang for the",
