No.: 60/416,155, which was filed on Oct. 4, 2002, and U.S. provisional application having Ser. No.: 60/424,269, which was filed on Nov. 6, 2002. Also, the present application is a continuation-in-part of copending U.S. patent applications having Ser. Nos. 10/263,160, 10/263,449, and 10/263,270, which were filed on Oct. 2, 2002 and are assigned to a common assignee, the teachings of which are hereby incorporated by reference., 52755=The LN 101 includes a set-top terminal (STT) 105 that provides the broadband signals to the remote devices 140-1 and 140-2, and, optionally, to additional remote devices including, for example, remote device 140-3. The STT 105 may be coupled to the remote devices either directly or via one or more other devices. It will be appreciated that the STT 105 may be a stand-alone unit or may be integrated into another device, such as, for example, a television or a computer. Additionally, the remote devices may be located in different rooms than where the STT 105 is located. Further information regarding the LN 101 is provided in copending U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 10/263,160; 10/263,270; and 10/263,449, which were filed on Oct. 2, 2002, the disclosure and teachings of which are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference., 63227=A tuner system 335 includes, in one implementation, an out-of-band tuner (not shown) for receiving out-of-band signals (e.g., administrative signals that were modulated using quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK)), and a plurality of in-band tuners 340-n (e.g., quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)/analog tuners) for receiving analog and/or digital in-band television channels. Alternatively, the tuner system 335 may only include one in-band tuner depending on a desired implementation. A signal processing system 345 may be capable of demodulating, demultiplexing, decrypting, and decoding signals that are tuned to by the tuner system 335. Although shown as one module, the signal processing system may comprise multiple modules that are located in different parts of the primary STT 205. It will be appreciated that in the preferred embodiment of the present invention the number of tuners 340-n typically corresponds to at least the optional coupled local device(s) 225 and the storage device 330. Further information regarding adding additional tuners can be found in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/263,449, which was filed on Oct. 2, 2002, the teachings of which are hereby incorporated by reference., 87720=It will be appreciated that the QPSK transmitter 600 may be enabled only when there are reverse command signals being transmitted, thereby enabling a way of preventing collisions between remote devices 215-n. Further embodiments of collision avoidance will be discussed further below. Additionally, the remote command signals may be encrypted and, therefore, decrypted accordingly in the command receiver 285. Further information regarding encryption/decryption can be found in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/154,495, which was filed on May 24, 2002 and is assigned to a common assignee, the teachings of which are hereby incorporated by reference.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes It should be emphasized that the above-described embodiments of the invention are merely possible examples, among others, of the implementations, setting forth a clear understanding of the principles of the invention. Many variations and modifications may be made to the above-described embodiments of the invention without departing substantially from the principles of the invention. All such modifications and variations are intended to be included herein within the scope of the disclosure and invention and protected by the following claims. In addition, the scope of the invention includes embodying the functionality of the preferred embodiments of the invention in logic embodied in hardware and/or software-configured mediums. Collision avoidance between the remote devices 215-n can be significantly improved in several ways. A preferred embodiment of the present invention, however, utilizes the asynchronous input data bits as an inexpensive way to transmit the reverse command signals from the plurality of remote devices 215-n to the primary STT 205. More specifically, the user input data is a sequence of asynchronous characters called a cell. Each cell contains a preamble, which is followed by several characters. The characters include, for example,one start bit, eight data bits, and one stop bit. An example may be that a low logical level represents a start bit or a data bit 0; a high logical level represents a stop bit or data bit 1. The eight data bits are the reverse command",
