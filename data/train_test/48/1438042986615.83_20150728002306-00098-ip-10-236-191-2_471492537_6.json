In order to sound the audible alarms and other watch- and chronograph-related sounds, a piezo transducer 38 is provided. When the Health-Watch is in UPDATE mode, data from the external data terminal may be input to the Health-Watch. This is the technique for updating the information stored in the non-volatile memory 28D. The Health-Watch is designed to have its second level of data accessed by an external data terminal. This data may include: family history, history of illness, immunization history, history of major operations, results of previous major tests, etc. The ASIC 28 contains a serial port 28E that converts data stored in parallel form into serial form. This serial data may be transmitted via a pair of conductors. The output of the serial port 28E transmits a bidirectional data stream to computer interface 30. A stereo mini-phono plug 32 plugs into computer interface 30. The serial data stream is transmitted via two conductor cable 34. In order to affect an interface to an existing data terminal or personal computer, an RS-232 adapter is provided.",
