The present embodiment 158 of the valve plate assembly also provides for the coupling of a pump thereto (a needle at the end of a pump hose can be inserted into the first opening 167 in the air-transfer stem) so as to facilitate the forced transfer of air into and out from the socket interior 118 when the air-transfer stem 164 is in the open position as shown in FIG. 7. In operation, for a wearer don the prosthetic limb utilizing the present embodiment 158, the wearer will first slide the air-transfer stem 164 into the open position as shown in FIG. 7 and will then push his or her residual limb into the socket interior 118 such that air inside the socket interior will be forced out through the opening 98 in the interface cushion member 84, through the opening 96 in the porous pad 86, through the opening 94 in the cylindrical base plate member 82, out through the opening 116 and the distal end of the prosthetic limb socket, through the central opening 172 in the disc member 161 of the valve plate component 160, through the air channel 166 in the air-transfer stem 164, and out",
