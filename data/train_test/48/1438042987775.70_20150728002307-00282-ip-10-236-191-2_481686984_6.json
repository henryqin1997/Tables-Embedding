    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{18501=For each satellite in the global positioning system (GPS), the total signal comprises two transmission signals, the L1 signal having a carrier frequency of 1.57542 GHz, and the L2 signal having a carrier frequency of 1.2276 GHz. Both the L1 and the L2 signals are biphase modulated by several digital signals. The high precision code (P) is one modulating signal which has a code rate of 10.23 MHz. Another signal is an optional encoding encrypting code (E) which is utilized by the Department of Defense (DOD) to encrypt and deny unauthorized access to the L2 GPS signal. The E code has been reported to have a bandwidth of approximately 500 kHz in the open literature., 22769=The GPS signal consists of two synchronous transmissions on carrier frequencies of 1.57542 GHz and 1.2276 GHz, known as Link 1 (L1) and Link 2 (L2), respectively. Both the L1 and the L2 signals are biphase modulated by digital symbols with amplitudes of \ufffd1. The digital signal sequences consist of a 10.23 Mbps high precision ranging code (P code - unclassified), a 1.023 Mbps clear/acquisition ranging code (C/A code), a 50 bps navigation information signal, and a classified encryption code (E code) overlaid on the P code. The E code forms a signal known as the Y code (Y=P\u2295E). The Y code provides GPS with anti-spoofing (A/S) capability and can be enabled or disabled by the GPS master control. Only authorized receivers have access to the Y code. Current operational policy by the DOD is to keep the Y code active at all times., 20032=The GPS Block II/IIA satellite constellation nominally comprises 24 operational satellites. Each satellite generates a navigation message based upon data periodically uploaded from a control segment which it then adds to a 1.023 MHz Pseudo Random Noise (PRN) Coarse/Acquisition (C/A) code sequence. The satellite modulates the resulting code sequence onto a 1575.42 MHz L-band carrier to create a spread spectrum ranging signal which it then broadcasts to the user community. This broadcast is referred to as the SPS ranging signal. Each C/A code is unique and provides the mechanism to identify each satellite in the constellation. The GPS satellite also transmits a second ranging signal known as L2 that supports PPS user two-frequency corrections. L2, like L1, is a spread spectrum signal and is transmitted at 1227.6 MHz.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is believed that the method and apparatus for eliminating ionospheric delay error in global positioning system signals of the present invention and many of its attendant advantages will be understood by the foregoing description, and it will be apparent that various changes may be made in the form, construction and arrangement of the components thereof without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention or without sacrificing all of its material advantages. The form herein before described being merely an explanatory embodiment thereof. It is the intention of the following claims to encompass and include such changes. The semi-codeless technique for high accuracy ionospheric GPS measurements of the present invention is expected to provide rms measurement errors of 0.25 meters or less. The disclosed algorithm has significant performance advantages over codeless techniques and has potential applications for wide lane kinematic techniques. A post-detection filter is required to suppress the multipath and noise error terms to provide a low-noise estimate of the ionospheric delay to the satellite. In one embodiment of the invention, a first-order filter with an eight second time constant was used to realize the post detection processing. Such a filter is suitable for very low rate ionospheric changes during periods of low solar activity. During periods of high solar activity, such a filter may not be adequate for processing the higher rates of ionospheric changes, in which case a higher order filter",
