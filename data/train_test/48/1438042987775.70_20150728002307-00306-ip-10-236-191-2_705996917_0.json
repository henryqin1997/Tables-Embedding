Stay abreast to new market changes with frequently updated training modules, new exclusive content, and our monthly newsletter. Proven system used by 10,000+ webmasters to produce hundreds of millions of dollars in profits. You learn SEO, and can apply it to all your projects.",
            "Fairly instant traffic stream. Good for measuring conversions.",
            "Generally cheaper than pay per click, especially after the first year.",
            "Fairly cheap. IF it works you get a good return. But that is a big IF...as it usually does not!",
            "Social interaction. If you are an employee, this can get you out of work for a couple weeks a year. Paid vacation. :-)",
            "At some point it makes sense for major businesses to hire an SEO. You really need to know a bit about the topic first to ensure you hire the right person. Many in house SEO teams subscribe to our site to help keep up with the industry and get a second opinion on complex questions.",
            "There are various costs and benefits depending on who you choose and what they know. Perspective has value. Some of these people (particularly the email marketers) are quite good at selling and conversion. Even subscribing to their email \"offers\" is a sales course in selling.",

            "Limited $300 up front cost. If you use our discount coupons you can save far more than the cost, even during your first month. No contracts. You can cancel anytime and owe nothing. Begin the member tour or join now.",
            "A variety of competitive research tools make it easy for competing sites to clone your keyword list and strategy, minimizing your longterm profit potential. Even Google offers a Search-based keyword tool that tells competitors what keywords are associated with your site! You have to keep improving your conversion rates to not get priced out of the auction. A dumb (or deep pocketed) competitor can price you out of the market. Many businesses simply can't buy as much traffic as they would like to. In some markets Google partners dominate & those with a high quality score are given a favorable position. The second you stop paying, your search traffic is turned off.",
            "Many firms charge rates as though an expert is working on your site, but have under-trained college graduates and interns working on your site. If search algorithms change dramatically they are required to service many clients at once. Hopefully you are paying them a lot of money so you are high on their priority list. If not, then you might be stuck buying a lot of paid search ads and/or firing some of your staff. Some SEO providers lock you into their proprietary systems.",
            "If an SEO is good at marketing there is no reason for them to price their services this low. Effective SEOs that know business can easily make 6 or 7 figures a year from setting up affiliate sites, AdSense websites, and/or building businesses around their skills. Many of the people which do services in this price range take the client's money and disappear. There is a market for lemons effect at the lower end of the market. And people get what they pay for. If they are able to rank your site for limited capital there is a good risk that they are employing high risk techniques, which may eventually end up destroying your rankings.",
            "Many conference speakers speak primarily as a sales channel. Rather than revealing their secrets, some reveal their sales pitches. Conference speakers are often limited to 10 to 15 minute slots, which require them to cover complex topics quickly - leading to reductionism and causing some audience members to hear one-liners, but not get the whole picture.",
            "More and more businesses are bringing SEO in house. If you want to hire someone it makes sense to spend a few hours reading our training modules to familiarize yourself with the topic and ensure you hire the right person. If you don't know what to look for and hire the wrong person they could destroy your rankings.",
            "Some companies selling SEO information should not be selling it. I remember 1 \"famous\" internet marketing outfit that asked me some EXCEPTIONALLY basic SEO questions 1 month, and the very next month were selling an SEO training course as though they were experts! Some services lift content from our site and try to resell it - you are better off buying direct and getting the latest information direct from the source. Some people only run their SEO site and do not run any other profitable websites. Some training programs try to force proprietary hosting and software services on you. Most of these services are outdated AND are not very interactive.",
