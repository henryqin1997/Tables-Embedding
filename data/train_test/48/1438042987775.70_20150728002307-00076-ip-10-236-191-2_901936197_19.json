            "Very intense yet worth the time spent studying.",
            "Make sure to review the teacher and class online before registering for it to make sure your prepared for the curriculum. Also make sure you make a two-year outline with a councilor, because this will help your registration number so you can register for classes first.",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Las Positas College is great for students who do well with more one-on-one help and feel more comfortable in a more interactive environment. I definitely take advantage of teacher's office hours to work with them and as questions and couldn't have asked for more help. I also feel like this environment is far less intimidating than to be on a huge campus where you feel rushed to get to your classes. This is a much more low-key option but also very friendly and helpful. Tips for prospective students One major tip that I can offer is to stay on top of your work. Now that you are out of high school, deadlines are not as structured as you are used to. There are not many turn-in dates for rough drafts or work sheets. Most of the work is on you. It is best to make deadlines for yourself. If you fall behind, it will be unnecessarily difficult to keep up. Bang for the buck Of course, junior colleges are cheaper than 4-year colleges. But, not only is the tuition cheaper, so are things like parking passes and there are also many different ways to go about buying books for cheap. Am enjoying being here",
