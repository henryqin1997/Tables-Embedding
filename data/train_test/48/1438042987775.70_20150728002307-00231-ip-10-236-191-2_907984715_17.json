            "there is a security guard on campus though out the day and is always everywhere it seems.",
            "This is not a traditional campus so there are no activities that are specifically for students but there are different events though-out the year such as a trick or treat for the children of students and an Easter hunt. They are very big into family.",
            "They have multiple vending machines and easy to get snacks for in between classes. The school is to small to have anything more when there is fast-food and restaurants right around the corner from the school.",
            "I do not live in a Dorm, but if they had dorms I would think that they would be as good as the school",
            "The teachers are excellent in helping you on every problem and bends over backwards (figuratively) to help students pass their class with a good grade.",
            "I would say that if you want a school that is there for you when you need help, counseling, or extra help on an assignment or many assignments this is the school for you.",
            "I love this school. The teachers are wonderful and actually seem like they care how you do and are not in it just for the paycheck. Davenport University is a school for the nontraditional student."

The courses are easy to understand and each student has the option to take 7-10-15 week courses and are able to complete there degree. If it was not for the advisers, financial aid and instructors then I would not be close to graduation., 202034=I loved Davenport because it allowed me to return to school full-time as a wife, mother and full-time working adult. I received my Associate and Bachelors from there starting classes in the Fall of 2010 and ending in August of 2013. It was a great experience and I found an interesting new field in Health Information Management. The instructors were helpful and for both degrees I completed my courses primarily online with the exception of 2 on campus courses. I graduated with honors and feel so proud ad thankful for my experience there!, 125342=Be prepared to put in many study hours to do well. The 7 week accelerated courses are a great way to complete the program much faster. Apply for the in-house scholarship for $1500 per semester.}",
