The sponsor, who keeps the worker\u2019s passport and other travel documents with him/her, plays a crucial role in the worker\u2019s life. All dealings with the government such as renewal of \u2018iqama\u2019 or residency permit are through the sponsor. Sources from the capital city, Riyadh, reported that among the total of 28000 surrounded migrants , authorities detained around 16,500 migrant workers in the first four days (November 5 \u2013 9, 2013) in a nationwide crackdown across seven provinces The Saudi officials confirmed that among the seven provinces nearly half of the migrants were arrested\u00a0near the southern border with Yemen and in Mecca where some Muslims stay on illegally after their pilgrimage., 12358=Though the police officials in the capital city claim that the security forces killed the African migrant worker in el-Manhoufa because he and others tried to resist arrest, the information from the migrants and from the publicly released video confirmed that the three Ethiopians killed were murdered by the brutal action of police. Among the victims was Umere Abdurahiman Ali , 24 an Oromo national from Ethiopia who was gunned down on November 5., 11461=5 comments - What do you think? Posted by admin - 13/11/2013 at 3:35 pm, 13795=Upon the expiration of the three months extended deadline for migrant workers to renew their residency and employment status ( November 4, 2013), thousands of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia most of whom believed to be from Ethiopia were apprehended in various regions of the Kingdom by Ministry of Labor inspection squads formed for this purpose under the pretext of flushing out workers who violate rules regarding work and residency permits., 13922=Taif: 2-736-5200, Makkah: 2-823-4111, Madinah: 4-857-2500, 9434=Saudi Arabia, the country which many Ethiopians have believed as a Holy Land, has turned into a Hell Land for them. But still remains Holy Land for the opportunistic radical Sheikhs and Imams from Ethiopia who are living on the alms from Saudis radical groups. These Ethiopian radical Sheikhs are living in abroad and preaching for Saudis Wahabism. Now they don\u2019t have moral to talk against the act of Saudis. Last time as Ethiopians were chased in the streets in Cairo, the so called Oromo Sheikhs and students in Al-Azhar University in Cairo have not said a word, coz they are working for Arabs while working on Oromos or Ethiopians. The Arabs know that they cannot reach the sources of the Nile and the fertile high land of Ethiopia which they call \u201d AL-JANNA \u201d , without using the trojan horses like those our deluded Sheikhs. This is a first Arabs test for Ethiopians, but the exam will come yet. Mind up !, 14199=November 13, 2013}",
