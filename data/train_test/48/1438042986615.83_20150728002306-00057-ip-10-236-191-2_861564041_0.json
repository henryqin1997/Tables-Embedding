All rights reserved., 26729=Born: May 24, 1941 in Duluth, MN, 23826=As a 16 year-old in 1970, it had been tough for me to get into Dylan prior to this -- dense lyrics, monotone voice -- the usual complaints about this towering poet stuck inside a musician's body. What this album gave to me was accessibility. His voice is smoothed out and warmer than before; the verses of the songs aren't quite as long, and many of the piano-based songs give the music a lighter melodic quality that wasn't emphasized on his earlier, hard-edged stuff. So I found this album highly appealing (still do). While I have gone on to appreciate and love his entire genre (Christian stuff included) these songs remain dear to me because it was my introduction to the great Bob Dylan. There isn't one throwaway cut. The album has a nice flow and universal feel. It doesn't lean too far to one side or the other. The music also feels quite autobiographical, as if we can actually see Dylan the man a little more clearly. He comes alive as a real human being, with a quite likeable personality. He's more musician than poet on this one.}",

    "textAfterTable": "12 Songs Editors\u2019 Notes Released four months after the controversial double LP Self Portrait, New Morning represents a return of sorts to a Bob Dylan that audiences had been comfortable with. Dylan's crooning style on Portrait and the country-based Nashville Skyline had confused critics and fans. Here, the vocal howl Dylan brings to \"Day of the Locusts\" and \"Went to See the Gypsy\" signal that he's back with vigor. The album's overall feel is one of being patched from several sets of sessions, which it is. It's a testament to Dylan's superior artistry that even with so many elements up in the air\u2014with no consistent producer or backing band\u2014he still weaves a coherent and touching vision. The songs vary from a sweet pop love song (\"If Not for You,\" also covered by George Harrison and Olivia Newton-John) to a scathing report of his experience receiving an honorary doctorate from Princeton University (\"Day of the Locusts\"). Dylan denies that \"Went to See the Gypsy\" is about Elvis Presley, but it nonetheless remains a beautifully wrought tale.\u00a0 Customer Reviews My Dylan Access Point \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by kenlobbster As",
