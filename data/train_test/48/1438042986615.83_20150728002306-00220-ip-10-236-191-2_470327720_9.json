    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{50941=It is also generally known that tachycardic conditions arise from circus motions which are \"depolarization wavefronts\" which move around localized regions of cardiac tissue, such as that described in a book by W. A. Tacker and L. A. Geddes entitled \"Electrical Defibrillation,\" CRC Press, 1980. Several circus motions may occur simultaneously, giving rise to chaotic, rotor motion characteristic of life-threatening fibrillation. Present means to control or inhibit these conditions generally require delivering enough energy via the lead electrodes to \"capture\" a critical volume of repolarizable tissue all at once. In so doing, a major portion of the cardiac tissue of the affected heart chamber is induced into a non-polarizable, refractory, state from which it can recover by means of artificial or natural pacing. Because brady and tachycardia often are arrhythmias occurring in a localized area of the heart, some conventional pacers and defibrillators are unable to effectively and consistently detect the onset of these conditions because of the limited number of leads and the compromise in lead locations. It would thus be desirable to be able to sense the heart's electrical activity at numerous (i.e., two or more and preferably four or more) locations within the heart., 73530=Referring still to FIG. 2, the master clock 143 generates a periodic timing signal which is provided to counter 145. Counter 145 may be included as part of the CPU 142 or may be a discrete device coupled to the CPU. The counter 145 counts cycles of the periodic timing signal generated by clock 143. The CPU can read the counter to determine the current count value. For example, if the clock signal is a 1000 Hz (1000 cycles per second) and a counter counts 500 cycles of the clock signal, the CPU will then know that the counter has counted for one-half of a second. The counter preferably is implemented as a \"count up\" counter and provides an output count value that begins with 0 and increments by 1 for each cycle of the periodic timing signal. Preferably, the CPU 142 can reset the counter 145 to begin counting again from 0.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Numerous variations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art once the above disclosure is fully appreciated. It is intended that the following claims be interpreted to embrace all such variations and modifications. (12) The integrity of a complete planet-satellite system is not jeopardized by a malfunction of any one satellite. A malfunctioning satellite may be explanted (i.e., removed) or left implanted, adjacent to a replacement satellite. (11) A rechargeable version of the planet would offer extended life to the pacer network 80 without the need to extract or replace leads; and (10) The satellites, having no batteries, minimize or eliminate the risk of the leakage of toxic contaminants into surrounding tissue; (9) Placement of satellites at the time when surgery permits some electrophysiological evaluation of the patient in the absence of any catheter placement in diseased hearts. Without the planet, interrogation of the satellites by means of an external programmer would provide diagnostic information prior to or during electrical and/or pharmacological therapy; (8) The satellites may be applied at the time of surgery in adults or infants as a prophylactic measure, for a future time when electrical therapy may be needed; (7) An epicardial ECG will be available to an external programmer simultaneous with interrogation of the planet, or independent of the planet and may eliminate the need for surface electrodes applied to the patient's body; (6) Communication with an external programmer",
