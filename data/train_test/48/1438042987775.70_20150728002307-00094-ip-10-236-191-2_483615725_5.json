It is not recommended that a user attempt to pull the knotted portion of the loop through his teeth, since normally the knot will be too large to permit it. To protectively cover the terminal loop links of chain 10 prior to placing them in the position of loop link 22 for detachment, it is desirable that a sliding cover member 26, FIG. 6, be provided on the portion of the circumferential periphery of dispenser 19 lying between opening 23 and loop link separator 25. Cover member 26 is being shown as being of inverse U-formation in cross-section, so as to embrace the rim of section 21 of the dispenser, with pins 27 extending therefrom into corresponding slot 28 dispenser in section 21 and in dispenser cover member 20, respectively. Thus, sliding cover member 26 can be pushed forwardly and backwardly with the aid of finger grip formations 29 to cover and uncover, respectively, the otherwise exposed portion of chain 10. In its forward position, it covers the terminal loop link 11 that",
