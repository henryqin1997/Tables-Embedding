Even the old dorm we toured was nice. Definitely liked the layout with private bedrooms shared by four students with a common living area and a small kitchen.

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Being a private Christian university, the price tag is fairly large. However, many scholarships are available. The education one receives here, in my opinion, is worth it. With professors who are passionate about Christ, students learn so much more than math and english. Students learns life skills and grow in the Lord. I believe the tuition is a small price to pay for such an education. Am enjoying being here The campus always has something going on. Whether it be small group bible lessons, corporate worship, or guest musician performing/speaking, there are multiple things one can participate in. This allows for many opportunities to meet new people, and make life-long friends. The Campus itself is beautiful: perfect for walks outside or outdoor gatherings. Overflowing with the love of Christ, the students and faculty are genuine and friendly. All of these factors combined create an enjoyable environment. Am learning a lot Teachers show a love for the subject they teach, and are available for extra help if needed. They push you to learn and give your best effort, but are there for you when you struggle. The small class sizes allow for more engaging participation. Login to rate",
