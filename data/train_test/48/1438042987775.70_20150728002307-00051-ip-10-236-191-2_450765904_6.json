Throughout California, curlleaf mountain-mahogany protein content ranged from a low of 6.2% (based on oven-dried weights) in February to a high of 12.3% in August [21]. In southwestern Montana, crude protein levels of current-year growth were 10.5% in the spring, 10.4% in the summer, 9.5% in the fall, and 9.8% in the winter [53].\u00a0Welch [227] reported that the digestible crude protein reported by Smith [182] exceed the protein requirements of mule deer in the winter season. Roper [165] provides the nutrient levels in curlleaf mountain-mahogany twigs and leaves for 3 locations in central Utah from April through September. Comparisons with true mountain-mahogany are provided as well [165]. Nutritional make up and digestibility of curlleaf mountain-mahogany in Utah are presented below [182]., 44598=From fire scars, fire history, historical literature, and past photos, researchers suggest that fire \"restricted curlleaf mountain-mahogany development\" in curlleaf mountain-mahogany stands in Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada. Since European settlement fire size and frequency have decreased, and curlleaf mountain-mahogany regeneration has \"far exceeded former levels.\" In the earliest photos of the study areas, curlleaf mountain-mahogany was confined to rocky sites or thin soil sites where fires were likely infrequent. Stand age analysis indicates that curlleaf mountain-mahogany abundance has increased in the past 170 years. Curlleaf mountain-mahogany stands on deep soils in central and southeastern Idaho and southwestern Montana were historically grasslands, and all curlleaf mountain-mahogany plants established after 1900. Researchers speculate that prior to 1900, a high fire frequency prevented curlleaf mountain-mahogany establishment [71]., 96136=Browsing: Many researchers indicate that curlleaf mountain-mahogany decreases with browsing [112,153,219]; however, Parker [153] suggests that on some soils, which are not described, curlleaf mountain-mahogany may increase with browsing. Browsing was simulated by clipping 90% of the previous-year growth on 4 year-old shrubs near Logan, Utah. Plants were clipped in either December or April. Clipped shrubs produced more biomass than unclipped shrubs when measured the following July. Differences were not significant [222]., 1533=Aboveground description: Curlleaf mountain-mahogany is a multi-branched evergreen tree or shrub. Mature plants range from 3 to 35 feet (0.9-11 m) tall [25,38,41,68,85,113,114,143,228]. One to several trunks is common. Main trunks may be more than 3 feet (0.9 m) in diameter but average 12 inches (30 cm) [79,95,105,114,171]. Young plants typically have branches growing near the ground, producing a shrubby appearance. Plants may not reach full height until 100 or more years of age [95,157]. Curlleaf mountain-mahogany is drought tolerant and grows slowly [112,114]. Plants are long lived. The oldest trees located in the Shoshone Range of Nevada were an estimated 1,350 years old [45,176]. Nineteen curlleaf mountain-mahogany-dominated communities scattered throughout Utah had high levels of morphological variability. There were treelike and shrublike plants with an average of 1.75 and 5.6 stems/plant, respectively. Canopy height ranged from an average low of 7 feet (2 m) on 1 plot to a high average of 15 feet (4.6 m) on another. Average tree age was 85, but 1 tree was estimated at 723 years of age [42]., 75556=In the Devil's Garden winter range area of the Modoc National Forest, curlleaf mountain-mahogany made up just 0.3% of the vegetation in the study area. Based on mule deer stomach contents, the highest levels of curlleaf mountain-mahogany use were in February (11.8% by volume and 50% in frequency). In the Truckee Canyon winter range near the California-Nevada border, curlleaf mountain-mahogany made up 1.2% of the available vegetation, and the highest levels of curlleaf mountain-mahogany came from stomachs analyzed in December. Curlleaf mountain-mahogany content was 7.0 % by volume and 80% in frequency [117]. Captive mule deer feeding trials revealed that curlleaf mountain-mahogany and curlleaf mountain-mahogany \ufffd true mountain-mahogany are preferred winter food sources [181,184]. In summer feeding trials curlleaf mountain-mahogany was not preferred [183]., 64076=Researchers visited a curlleaf mountain-mahogany stand near Mackay, Idaho, that burned approximately 71 years earlier. Curlleaf mountain-mahogany plants ranged from 8 to 54 years old, suggesting that regeneration began 17 years following the fire. In another stand that burned in 1965, researchers found no curlleaf mountain-mahogany regeneration in 1968 [173]. No information on fire season or severity was provided., 26498=Nevada: The average annual precipitation in curlleaf mountain-mahogany habitats of western and central Nevada is 14 to 45 inches (360-1,150 mm), most of which comes in the winter as rain or snow in the Carson Range. Average annual precipitation is less, 16 to 20 inches (410-510 mm), and comes between March and June in the Shoshone Range. The mean number of frost-free days ranges from 30 to 80 days [176]. In northeastern Nevada's Lamoille Canyon, the summer minimum and maximum temperatures recorded from 30 June to 26 August in a curlleaf mountain-mahogany stand at 7,200 feet (2,200 m) elevation were 95 \ufffdF (35 \ufffdC) and 54 \ufffdF (12 \ufffdC), respectively [123]., 62998=Later postfire effects: Several studies indicate that curlleaf mountain-mahogany regeneration on burned sites rarely takes more than 30 years and in some cases can be quick. In Mountain City, Nevada, over 4,000 three-year-old seedlings/acre occurred on burned sites visited in postfire year 7, following a stand-replacing fire that burned on 21 October. Researchers believed seedlings germinated from the soil seed bank. Two percent of the curlleaf mountain-mahogany trees sprouted following the fire in Mountain City. Between 1% and 4% of the curlleaf mountain-mahogany trees sprouted following a fire in Targhee, Idaho, and postfire sprouts were observed only from plants 20 to 30 years of age. In Challis, Idaho, curlleaf mountain-mahogany regeneration took approximately 30 years following a severe summer fire that \"apparently destroyed\" any seed source. Poor seedling establishment on burned sites may have been a product of limited seed dispersal and/or harsh site conditions [71]., 72311=Cattle: In the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest, cattle utilization of curlleaf mountain-mahogany is low because of the steep slopes occupied [97]. Utilization of summer range in south-central Utah was evaluated in September. In areas without cattle, utilization of curlleaf mountain-mahogany was 10.8%; in a grazing allotment area, utilization was 21.4%. The differences, however, cannot be solely attributed to cattle, as mule deer pellet counts in the allotment were 1.7 times greater on sites with cattle than without cattle [100]., 76540=Deer/Elk: Elk consumed more curlleaf mountain-mahogany than mule deer in a Utah study. Feces collected from January through March revealed that the relative density of curlleaf mountain-mahogany in elk diets was 3% and in mule deer diets was less than 1% [141]. Curlleaf mountain-mahogany and Utah juniper-curlleaf mountain-mahogany stands in the Big Horn Mountains of Wyoming are important wintering habitat for elk and deer. Curlleaf mountain-mahogany plants in this area are hedged from heavy browsing [48]., 14190=Several studies report the germinability of seed collected in the field. Germination was enhanced by cold stratification. Seventy-six percent of cold stratified curlleaf mountain-mahogany seed collected in southwestern Montana germinated, and 50% produced cotyledons [53]. Current-year and 2-year-old seed collected near the high desert steppe zone in central Oregon averaged 74% and 78% viability, respectively. Unstratified seeds did not germinate, and seeds stratified for 60 and 170 days in dark at 40 \ufffdF (4 \ufffdC) had germination percentages of 20% and 98%, respectively. Seeds planted in containers, left outdoors in the fall to stratify naturally averaged 24% germination. Germination started on 14 April when soil moisture levels were high and temperatures were cool [45,47]., 65165=Fuels/fire behavior: The following study provides information on fuel conditions and fire behavior in curlleaf mountain-mahogany-big sagebrush vegetation type during different moisture conditions. In Lava Beds National Monument, a wildfire burned on 11 July, when the daytime high temperatures were approximately 82 \ufffdF (28 \ufffdC), relative humidity levels were 20%, wind speeds were 9.3 to 12 miles per hour (15-20 km/hour), and dead wood between 0.2 to 1 inch (0.5-2.6 cm) in diameter averaged 3% moisture. There was no precipitation in the month previous to the wildfire. Under these conditions, just 5% of the study area was unburned, and curlleaf mountain-mahogany cover was 0% in the burned study area. A prescribed fire burned in early July when the daytime high temperatures averaged 81 \ufffdF (27 \ufffdC), relative humidity levels were 18%, winds were 0 to 7.5 miles per hour (0-12 km/hour), and dead wood between 0.2 to 1 inch (0.5-2.6 cm) in diameter averaged 6% moisture. This fire followed a month with exceptionally high precipitation levels. In the prescribed fire area, 37% of the area remained unburned, and curlleaf mountain-mahogany cover was 19.3% within the perimeter. Whether or not the curlleaf mountain-mahogany survived in burned areas or just in unburned patches within the prescribed fire area was not reported [208]., 47376=In the Petersen Mountains of western Nevada, the area occupied by curlleaf mountain-mahogany has \"decreased dramatically\" from 1954 to 1997 as a result of increased fire incidence. Increased fire frequency has been linked to increased cheatgrass dominance. The area occupied by curlleaf mountain-mahogany in 1954 was nearly 14% more than that occupied in 1996. The researcher predicts that the current fire frequency in the areas will make successful recruitment impossible [166]., 80773=Birds: The Douglas-fir/curlleaf mountain-mahogany habitat type of central Idaho provides important nesting sites for dusky grouse, dusky flycatchers, rock wrens, and American kestrels [190]. Chipping sparrows, dusky flycatchers, bushtits, Townsend's solitaires, and rufous-sided towhees were associated with curlleaf mountain-mahogany-big sagebrush communities in the Strawberry Creek drainage of Great Basin National Park [131]. In northwestern Nevada's Sheldon Wildlife Refuge, 61 passerine bird species were recorded along 4 transects visited from 1978 to 1984. Most common were gray flycatchers, scrub jays, Brewer's blackbirds, vesper sparrows, Brewer's sparrows, green-tailed towhees, sage thrashers, bushtits, blue-gray gnatcatchers, and American robins. Scrub jays and American robins used curlleaf mountain-mahogany for nesting, and gray flycatchers consumed insects while perched on curlleaf mountain-mahogany branches [64]., 46497=A mean fire return interval of between 13 and 22 years from 1750 to the early 1900s was estimated from fire-scarred ponderosa pine trees scattered in curlleaf mountain-mahogany stands on steep south- and west-facing slopes of the Salmon River Canyon in Idaho. Since 1900 the fire return interval has increased substantially due to heavy livestock grazing, which reduced the amount of fine fuels, fire exclusion practices, and/or decreased human-caused fires. While curlleaf mountain-mahogany was likely restricted to rocky sites where fuel levels were low prior to 1900, curlleaf mountain-mahogany did regenerate when fires were frequent. At the time of the study, curlleaf mountain-mahogany stands were decadent, and researchers hypothesized that fire may have been important to curlleaf mountain-mahogany recruitment or \"vigor\" [7]., 90608=Survival on reclaimed sites: Curlleaf mountain-mahogany's survival on roadside cuts, poorly vegetated riversides, and mine sites has been variable. On the south Fork of the Payette River in Boise County, Idaho, curlleaf mountain-mahogany only survived on sites that remained free of weeds after planting. Sites were disked in 1949, and curlleaf mountain-mahogany survival was just 10%. Plants averaged 2.5 inches (6.3 cm) tall in the 3rd year after planting [88]. Revegetation of western Montana road cuts that are outside of curlleaf mountain-mahogany's natural range were evaluated 4 years after planting. Curlleaf mountain-mahogany plants were in \"less than satisfactory condition\" at the time of spring planting. Just 7% of 29 curlleaf mountain-mahogany plants survived, but surviving plants were described as \"established and in good condition\" 9 years after planting. Researchers rated curlleaf mountain-mahogany's growth, vigor, natural spread, and soil stabilization as moderate to very low [89]. One-year-old curlleaf mountain-mahogany seedlings planted on roadside cuts and fill slopes in Colville and Okanogan National Forests of eastern Washington averaged 42%. Survival and vigor, based on plant size and color, were rated as good when plants were evaluated 2 years after planting [210]., 67969=Fire should be discouraged in big sagebrush-antelope bitterbrush mule deer winter range on the east side of the Sierra Nevada range. Fire incidence has increased in recent time. From 1957 to 1982, 49,000 acres (20,000 ha) of winter range burned, but from 1983 to 1988, 159,000 acres (64,300 ha) burned. On burned sites, cheatgrass is typically the most abundant species. The stomach contents of mule deer taken in December of 1951 and 1952 revealed diets of mostly browse: big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, and curlleaf mountain-mahogany. Dry cheatgrass was 6% of mule deer diets at that time. Mule deer analyzed in 1987 had diets composed primarily of dry cheatgrass (79%) [217]., 62004=The Moose Creek Fire on the Salmon National Forest burned in drought conditions. Temperatures were high, humidity levels were low, and winds were gusty. Fire behavior was \"variable.\" Curlleaf mountain-mahogany suffered high mortality. Of 40 individuals examined in the 1st postfire year, only 2 survived. Plants that survived the fire or escaped the fire in unburned patches produced \"huge quantities\" of seed in the 1st postfire growing season. No information beyond the 1st postfire year was reported [37]. A severe fire that burned in August in the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness, Idaho, completely killed many curlleaf mountain-mahogany stands, and no sprouts or seedlings were observed for the 1st three postfire growing seasons. Other fire characteristics or fire weather conditions were not reported, but researchers described the fire as \"hot\" [155,199]., 45618=In the Big Springs Wash and Decathon Canyon sites in Great Basin National Park, researchers reconstructed the fire history from singleleaf pinyon fire scars. Curlleaf mountain mahogany grew on the sites. Fires likely occurred somewhere in the area every 40 years between 1688 and 1896. Some very rocky sites with low fuel levels may have burned at 50- to 100-year intervals. Fires were commonly patchy producing\u00a0a mosaic of burned and unburned areas. Curlleaf mountain-mahogany abundance increased tremendously with the exclusion of fire after 1900 [74]., 43107=Fire exclusion and curlleaf mountain-mahogany range expansion: Fire exclusion in curlleaf mountain-mahogany habitats has facilitated increased curlleaf mountain-mahogany abundance and successful regeneration in some areas. Repeat photography revealed that curlleaf mountain-mahogany increased in the absence of fire in warm, dry sites in southwestern, central, and southeastern Montana [72] and in parts of Utah's Fishlake National Forest. Early photographs from Utah showing low curlleaf mountain-mahogany coverage date from 1905 to 1938, and recent photographs with increased coverage date from 1996 to 2001 [104].}",

    "textBeforeTable": "The following table provides fire return intervals for plant communities and ecosystems where curlleaf mountain-mahogany is important. For further information, see the FEIS review of the dominant species listed below. Singleleaf pinyon-California juniper (Juniperus californica)-western juniper woodlands of California's San Bernardino Mountains support a fire regime that has not changed with fire exclusion practices. The open fuel arrangement in these woodlands support a long fire-return interval of severe stand-replacing fires that kill most shrubs and trees. Fires require extreme weather conditions [223]. In western and central Nevada, researchers evaluated the age structure in curlleaf mountain-mahogany stands on 3 mountain ranges. Stands were multiaged, contained some very old trees (1,350 years old), and had several fire-scarred curlleaf mountain-mahogany trees. A sparse understory and natural fire breaks on the sites suggested that fires were rare. When fires occurred, severity was probably low and mature, thick-barked curlleaf mountain-mahogany trees likely survived [176]. In the Petersen Mountains of western Nevada, the area occupied by curlleaf mountain-mahogany has \"decreased dramatically\" from 1954 to 1997 as a result of increased fire incidence. Increased fire frequency has been linked to increased cheatgrass dominance. The area occupied by curlleaf mountain-mahogany in 1954 was nearly 14% more than that occupied in 1996. The researcher predicts that the current fire frequency in the areas will make successful recruitment impossible [166]. A mean fire return interval of between 13 and 22 years from 1750 to the early 1900s was estimated from fire-scarred ponderosa pine trees scattered in curlleaf",

Heavy curlleaf mountain-mahogany mortality is common following most fires [ 71]. DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT: Some indicate that dry, windy fire conditions are necessary to kill curlleaf mountain-mahogany trees [ 11, 126]. Likely the requirement of dry, windy conditions depends on stand characteristics and available fuels.",
