Megastars in music aligned to bring us monster tours and epic collaborations, and plenty of our favorite artists came back from the dead (literally and figuratively) to give us new tunes and live performances. While summer 2014 may be over, we can't help but look ahead to next\u2026, 2443=On June 29th, Bieber announced that he began recording on a new album. He promises that it will be even bigger than \"My World 2.0\"., 6676=Justin Bieber's 2013 started out strong, with The Believe Tour at full throttle, a performance on The Ellen Degeneres Show to announce an acoustic album, and a stint as both host and musical guest on Saturday Night Live on February 9., 4233=We could talk about the other projects that Justin Bieber has been involved with namely remix albums, Christmas albums, television appearances and a 3D biopic-concert film but it would only begin to scratch the surface of his mass appeal as it stands now. He released his third studio album, 'Believe,' in June 2012 with an intentional musical departure from his previous teen pop sound. His global fan base embraced it, and 'Beliebers' worldwide made the project his fourth chart topper in the United States and the No. 1 album on the Billboard 200., 5403=Can the Biebs bounce back? Only time will tell, but for now he's fully engaged and continuing on with his tour. It won't wrap until August 10, with the final show scheduled at the Philips Arena in Atlanta, Georgia. Special guests thus far has included Usher, Jaden Smith, Drake, Big Sean and Ludacris., 6361=On March 7, 2013 Bieber fainted backstage at London's O2 Arena after complaining of breathing problems throughout his performance and was taken to a hospital. Five days later, a concert in Lisbon, Portugal at the Pavilhao Atlantico was reportedly canceled due to low ticket sales. And that was far from the beginning of a string of incidents which had the media salivating over the 'rise and fall' of the once squeaky clean pop star., 9958=Bieber spent the end of 2013 rolling out brand new music, including the songs \"Heartbreaker,\" \"All That Matters,\" \"Hold Tight,\" \"Recovery,\" \"Bad Day,\" \"All Bad,\" \"PYD,\" Roller Coaster,\" \"Change Me,\" and \"Confident.\" All 10 tracks later appeared on a collection called \"Journals,\" which added five additional unreleased songs and a music video for \"All That Matters.\", 3664=If you want Justin Bieber tickets, SeatGeek is one of the few places you may be able to find them. All 49 North American dates of his 'Believe' world tour (kicking off September 29 in Glendale, Arizona) sold out within one hour. Tickets for two nights at New York City's famed Madison Square Garden (on November 28 and 29) were gone in 30 seconds. It's a true testament to Bieber's enduring popularity as he makes the leap from tween heartthrob to adult artist, his throngs of screaming fans will be there with him every step of the way., 9452=It turns out that 2014 was rather uneventful for Bieber, who seemingly decided to lay low in the wake of continued legal troubles. Billboard magazine, for one, believed he was looking to pull off a crowd-pleasing redemption story. And by the end of the year, Bieber and his longtime manager Scooter Braun had begun to tease his next album. \"My break is for a reason. U will see soon. Thank you for your patience,\" Bieber posted on Instagram. Braun also declared in a separate post, \"2013 was Practice. 2014 was The Warm Up. 2015 is Game Time.\", 7969=Bieber's speech was mumbled, his pupils dilated, his face flushed and eyes bloodshot, according to police reports. And that was just the start of his troubles. A week later, the Biebs was arrested again, this time after turning himself in to Toronto police to face assault charges. He's accused of clashing with a limousine driver on December 29, 2013, and was said to have struck the driver on the back of the head several times., 7521=The prospect of a third criminal arrest for Bieber hangs on a pending decision by a Los Angeles prosecutor after the star was alleged to have egged his neighbors' home. The neighbor accused Bieber of tossing eggs over a fence and onto the mansion next door on January 9, 2014, causing an estimated $20,000 in damage. In response, a dozen LA County Sheriff's deputies raided Bieber's home in Calabasas, California, taking the security system as evidence., 8864=It seems the Beliebers are definitely anxious for Justin's next musical endeavors, and it appears they won't have to wait long. H confirmed in V magazine's Music Issue that he is working on a new album and a tour for 2015. The magazine even quoted him as saying, \"I took the last year off and I'm excited to get back to work.\", 5042=If you're looking for an artist who has fully harnessed the power of the Internet, look no farther than Justin Bieber. Discovered via YouTube in 2008 by talent manager Scott 'Scooter' Braun, the Canadian singer-songwriter immediately shed the image of overnight sensation at the age of 13. As quick as his spontaneous dance moves, Bieber had surpassed some 40 million Facebook fans and 20 million Twitter followers all before his 18th birthday., 8216=It's safe to say that 2014 is off to a no good, very bad start for Justin Bieber.
