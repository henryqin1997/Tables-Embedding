See for example, \u201cCMOS Analog Integrated Circuits Based on Weak Inversion Operation\u201d by Eric Vittoz and Jean Fellrath, IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, Vol. SC-12, No. 3, June 1977. See particularly FIG. 8 of this article, and the associated description., 172192=The receiver 30 is a radio frequency receiver included in the integrated circuit 16, and the transmitter 32 is a radio frequency transmitter included in the integrated circuit 16. In one embodiment, the receiver 30 includes a Schottky diode detector. Various forms of Schottky diode detectors are described in a paper titled \u201cDesigning Detectors for RF/ID Tags,\u201d by Raymond W. Waugh of Hewlett-Packard Company, submitted for presentation at the RF Expo, San Diego, Feb. 1, 1995, and incorporated herein by reference., 323903=Design of a clocked sequential circuit is known in the art. See, for example, chapter 6 of Digital Logic and Computer Design by M. Morris Mano, 1979, Prentice-Hall, Inc. A typical design procedure involves describing circuit behavior using a state diagram (see FIG. 64), obtaining a state table (see FIG. 66), assigning binary values to each state (see FIG. 64), determining the number of flip-flops needed (see FIG. 65), choosing the type of flip-flops to be used (see FIG. 65), using Karnaugh maps or other simplification methods, deriving circuit output functions and flip-flop input functions (see FIGS. 67 and 68), and drawing the logic diagram. The numbers in parentheses in FIG. 64 are the binary state numbers. ENDT enables the sampling of the data (always at state two when no transition occurred). There are several ways to implement a circuit to perform functions of a state diagram. Assume that Q1 and Q0 are the binary state numbers in parentheses above (Q1 on the left, Q0 on the right), and that D1 and D0 are the next state values of Q1 and Q0, respectively. This is illustrated in FIG. 65. The flip-flop outputs Q0 and Q1 are the states. Then, a state table can be derived. This is shown in FIG. 66. Using Karnaugh maps (see FIGS. 67 and 68), minimum logic to perform the desired function can be derived. It should be noted, of course, that minimum logic need not be employed--logic involving an increased number of logic gates but performing the same desired function can also be employed. From the Karnaugh map shown in FIG. 67, the following equation can be derived: D 0=Q 1+TX\ufffdQ 0+En\ufffdTX which can also be written as: D 0=[Q 1\u2032\ufffd(TX\ufffdQ 0)\u2032\ufffd(En\ufffdTX)\u2032]\u2032 where the symbol \u201c+\u201d represents a logical OR, the symbol \u201c\ufffd\u201d represents a logical AND, and the symbol \u201c\u2032\u201d represents a logical NOT., 73347=This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 08/705,043, filed on Aug. 29, 1996, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,130,602 (incorporated herein by reference), which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application 60/017,900, filed May 13, 1996, titled \u201cRadio Frequency Data Communication Device\u201d., 196900=FIGS. 7.02AA-BF provide a circuit drawing of an address decoder \u201cadrdec.\u201d In executing instructions, the processor has the need to move bytes of data between registers and ram \u201cram\u201d and possibly to the serial IO controller \u201csio.\u201d The address decoder \u201cadrdec\u201d generates enable lines to those various different blocks (the registers, ram, and sio, as appropriate) when their address appears on the address bus. The primary input to the address decoder is the address bus. This decoder decides which circuit block is being addressed and issues an enable for either a write or a read, whichever is appropriate, to that particular block., 200052=FIGS. 7.0308AA-BB provide a circuit drawing of a RAM column select decode circuit \u201cramcdec.\u201d The RAM column select decode circuit uses three address lines \u201cAD5-AD7\u201d to generate eight select lines \u201cCSEL0-CSEL7.\u201d, 191436=The data processor \u201cdataproc\u201d shown in FIGS. 6AA-EK is the micro controller or microprocessor 34 of FIG. 5. The data processor \u201cdataproc\u201d is shown in greater detail in FIG. 7. In the illustrated embodiment, the data processor \u201cdataproc\u201d is an eight bit processor, and includes a ROM \u201crom,\u201d a RAM \u201cram,\u201d a serial I/O block \u201csio,\u201d an eight bit ALU (arithmetic logic unit) \u201calu,\u201d an instruction decoder programmable logic array \u201cinsdec,\u201d and address decoder \u201cadrdec,\u201d a clock generator \u201cclk,\u201d a conditional qualifier decoder \u201ccqualdec,\u201d a databus latch/precharge circuit \u201cdblatch,\u201d a timed lockout divider \u201ctld,\u201d a data interleaver (which interleaves two thirteen bit words) \u201cdil,\u201d a convolutional encoder and preamble generator \u201cconv,\u201d a digital port output controller \u201cdoutport,\u201d a shift register input data multiplexer \u201cshdel\u201d and a series of registers. In the illustrated embodiment, the registers include a timed lockout register \u201ctloreg,\u201d a plurality of status registers \u201csreg,\u201d a plurality of read/write control registers \u201coreg,\u201d and an instruction register \u201cinsreg.\u201d, 215903=FIG. 7.1001 provides a circuit drawing showing details of construction of a timed lock out divider cell \u201ctldcel\u201d included in the timed lockout divider \u201ctld.\u201d, 216851=FIG. 7.1201 provides construction details of a control register cell \u201cregcell\u201d included in the output register \u201coreg.\u201d, 224628=FIG. 7.1601 provides a circuit drawing showing construction details of a shift register cell \u201cconvshr\u201d included in the convolutional encoder \u201cconv.\u201d, 173169=Therefore, the device 12 can operate over a wide range of carrier frequencies. For example, the device 12 can operate with carriers of 915-5800 MHZ. In a more particular embodiment, the device 12 can operate with carrier frequencies in the 915, 2450, or 5800 MHZ bands. In the illustrated embodiment, the antennas are half wave antennas, and frequency selectivity of the device 12 is achieved based on selection of the antenna external to the integrated circuit 16. Capacitors employed in the Schottky diode detector are also selected based on the carrier frequency that will be employed., 250195=One embodiment of the invention comprises a Schottky diode 220 including an n+region 222 generally encircling or surrounding an n-well region 224 (FIG. 41). In the illustrated embodiment, the n+region 222 is heavily doped; e.g., 1\ufffd1018 atoms/cm3 or greater of n-type material, and the n-well region 224 is lightly doped; e.g., 1\ufffd1017 atoms/cm3 or lower of n-type material. The n-well region 224 defines a contact area 226, and the n+region 222 provides a low resistance interconnect to the Schottky diode 220. The n+region 222 has a diffused edge 228, and the n-well region has a contact edge 230. The distance from the n+region diffused edge 228 to the n-well region contact edge 230 is minimized. In one embodiment, the distance from the n+region diffused edge 228 to the n-well region contact edge 230 is less than twenty micrometers. In a more preferred embodiment, the distance from the n+region diffused edge 228 to the n-well region contact edge 230 is about two micrometers., 205856=FIGS. 7.06AA-CN provide a circuit drawing of an instruction decoder PLA \u201cinsdec.\u201d The instruction decoder PLA interprets what is in the instruction register \u201cinsreg\u201d and issues all the enable signals necessary to effect performance of the functions called for in that instruction. Details of the instruction decoder PLA are shown in FIGS. 7.0601AA-HI; 7.0602AA-JH; 7.0603AAJI; and 7.0604AA-JI., 458621=At step 576, the device 12 sends a preamble, consisting of 2000 bits of alternating pairs of ones and zeros, to the interrogator via radio frequency. After performing step 576, the data processor proceeds to step 578., 244569=A second desirable feature for the integrated circuit of an RFID tag is to eliminate the need to use inductors when constructing the Schottky diode detector. One technique for providing a bias current to a Schottky diode is disclosed in FIG. 28. FIG. 28 illustrates a receiver 60 including an antenna 62 and a Schottky diode detector 64. The receiver 60 includes inductors 68 and 70 used to provide the bias current via voltage source 74 with this implementation. A capacitor 76 is shunted to ground, and a second capacitor 78 is placed in series, providing AC coupling to the video amplifier. Several variations of such inductor-based bias current implementations are described in a paper entitled \u201cDesigning Detectors for RF/ID Tags,\u201d by Raymond W. Waugh of Hewlett-Packard Company, submitted for presentation at the RF Expo, San Diego, Feb. 1, 1995, and which is already incorporated by reference. Inductors are required in all of these constructions, but their implementation on an integrated circuit proves difficult because of problems inherent in forming inductors in an integrated circuit. The circuit in FIG. 29 eliminates the inductors by biasing the Schottky diode with a high impedance current source. A current sink is provided by connecting the far end of the antenna to Vdd., 155285=Various U.S. patent applications, which are incorporated herein by reference, disclose features that are employed in various alternative embodiments of the invention: 08/092,147, filed Jul. 15, 1993, \u201cWake Up Device for a Communications System\u201d, now abandoned, and continuation application 08/424,827, filed Apr. 19, 1995, \u201cWake Up Device for a Communications System\u201d, now U.S. Pat.

No. 5,539,775., 360099=The multiplier cell originally developed by Gilbert employed bipolar junction transistors. It is also known to employ MOS transistors to produce a Gilbert multiplier cell. See, for example, Analog Integrated Circuits for Communication, Principles, Simulation and Design, Donald O. Pederson and Kartikeya Mayaram, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Third Printing, 1994, pp. 431-433., 358801=Analog multipliers are known in the art. An analog multiplier includes two inputs, and includes an output providing a signal that is representative of a multiplication of one of the inputs with the other of the inputs. One known analog multiplier is known as a Gilbert multiplier cell. For a detailed discussion of Gilbert cells, see Four Quadrant Multiplier, B. Gilbert, IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits, 1968, pp. 365-373. Such Gilbert multiplier cells are also described in detail in Analysis and Design of Analog Integrated Circuits, Paul R. Gray and Robert G. Meyer, Third Edition, 1993, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., pp. 667-681. Such Gilbert multiplier cells include two cross-coupled, emitter-coupled pairs of bipolar junction transistors in series with an emitter coupled pair of bipolar junction transistors. A Gilbert multiplier cell employing bipolar junction transistors produces an output that is the hyperbolic tangent of two input voltages. This is because a characteristic of bipolar junction transistors is exponential non-linearity. If the input voltages are sufficiently low, the hyperbolic tangent function can be approximated as linear, and the circuit behaves as a multiplier which multiplies together the two input voltages., 474346=The device 12 can be used to impede car theft. A European anti-theft directive (74/61/EEC) provides that all new car models sold after January 1997 must be fitted with electronic immobilizers and approved alarm systems. The devices 12 can be provided on keychains or within car keys, and interrogators 26 placed in cars, so that the vehicle will be inoperable unless the specified device 12 for a specific car is used. The interrogator 26 can control the door locks of a car, or the ignition of the car, or both. Because the device 12 includes memory, the interrogator 26 in the car can periodically automatically change values in the device 12 (like changing a password)., 207655=FIGS. 7.07AA-BB provide a circuit drawing of a conditional qualifier decoder \u201ccqualdec.\u201d Certain instructions behave differently depending on certain conditions (e.g., whether a carry bit is set), and the conditional qualifier decoder looks for these conditions., 180681=In summary, various tests are performed, and the order in which they are performed is preferably selected to most quickly identify invalid signals. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/424,827, filed Apr. 19, 1995 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/092,147, which are incorporated herein by reference, disclose tests that could be employed in various alternative embodiments of the invention., 199698=FIGS. 7.0307AA-BB provide a circuit drawing of a RAM word line decoder \u201cramwdec.\u201d The RAM word line decoder receives the select lines from the RAM wordline driver in conjunction with four other addresses \u201cAD0-AD3\u201d to select a unique word line. A word line is a row of RAM cells within the RAM., 203825=FIGS. 7.0406AA-CK provide a circuit drawing of a ROM bit line decoder \u201crombldec.\u201d The ROM bit line decoder provides a decoder structure for selecting a particular ROM bit line out of thirty-two bit lines. There are eight such \u201crombldec\u201d circuits, allowing simultaneous selection of eight bit lines., 242036=In order to meet the wide range of intended applications, it is desirable to construct the integrated circuit for an RFID tag to realize operation of a wide range of carrier frequencies. For example, several desirable carrier frequencies for the device disclosed in FIGS. 5 and 6 are 915, 2450, and 5800 MegaHertz bands. Frequency selectivity is realized in the device of FIGS. 5 and 6 by appropriately configuring external antennas and internal circuit components of the integrated circuit. For the case of a single integrated circuit with an active on-board transmitter, it is necessary to design circuit components into the integrated circuitry prior to mounting and encapsulation of the integrated circuit with an antenna inside of a package. Hence, the circuit components needed to facilitate tailoring of the carrier frequency must be \u201cdesigned in\u201d the integrated circuit. In the case of a backscatter transmitter, components included in the integrated circuit can be selected so as to allow operation over a wide range of carrier frequencies, the selection being made by choice of antenna., 74435=Appended hereto is a microfiche copy of a software guide entitled \u201cMicron RFID Systems Developer's Guide,\u201d May 2, 1996. This appendix has 5 microfiche providing 266 total frames., 224816=FIG. 7.1602 provides a circuit drawing showing construction details of a summer \u201cconvsum\u201d included in the convolutional encoder \u201cconv.\u201d, 258899=The above described processes for forming a Schottky diode are preferred over a process wherein, after the contact holes a etched, ion implantation of phosphorus into the holes is performed. In such a process, the implant would be a two step process, with a low energy implant (e.g., 35 keV of 4\ufffd1012 ions/cm2) followed by a high energy implant (e.g., 120 keV of 4\ufffd1012 ions/cm2). Such implants cause a high doping level at the bottom of the contact hole, which prevents formation of a low leakage Schottky diode. The preferred processes described above eliminates these two contact implants, and allows for formation of a good quality Schottky diode., 166029=Spread spectrum techniques are also disclosed in the following patent applications and patent, which are incorporated herein by reference: U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/092,147; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/424,827, filed Apr. 19, 1995; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,121,407 to Partyka et al.
