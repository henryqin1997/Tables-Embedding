            "If you're worried about walking back to your dorm late at night or really anytime of the day, we have campus escorts you can call toll free at 1-800-534-WALK. I remembered that from orientation. 1-800-534-WALK! There's also emergency polls, where you can push this button and it makes a loud beeping sound. Nearby cameras will focus on that area and see what the issue is and get security there as ASAP if the situation is real.",
            "There are a bajillion different clubs you can explore from ethnic clubs, different interests, sports, student government. The list goes on. Make sure to take advantage of these as well or at least check them out!",
            "Revelle college has an annual Watermelon Drop that they host on the top of Argo Hall (6th floor). We have a beautiful graffiti hall for students to express their creative side. We have a secret underground tunnel, but it's a secret.",
            "Mexico is literally right across the border, about a 30 minute drive from campus. If you're feeling a little spontaneous and risky, plan a trip with some friends. Just make sure you all stick together and have your passports. It's a plus if you have a Spanish speaking friend. Downtown has a lot of 18+ clubs, sometimes with transportation for UCSD students! Check out the nightlife sometime. If you haven't already, the carne assada fries and the California burrito are necessary to try as a student. So do so! You won't regret it... Meet some students that are from San Diego so they can show you outside of La Jolla and really see what San Diego is about! The beach and the cliffs are only 10 minute walking distance, so take advantage of the beautiful scenery!",
            "There are many different dining options for students. The best ones that students like to go to are Ocean View Terrance and Pines. The Bistro has sushi you can swipe with dining dollars too! Food is expensive but you'll be using your dining dollars. I highly recommend budgeting, because it's really sad when it's only Winter quarter and people are out of dining dollars. If that does happen, local grocery markets are only a few bus stops away and public transportation is free for students!",
            "Every college within UCSD has its own feel and aura. You will meet all kinds of people from those who are really strange, those who have completely different financial, social status to people that you will get along with really well. It's super convenient to get from dorm room to classroom. Some colleges provide a kitchen so you can even cook your own meals if you miss home cooked food. You have lots of freedom, but make responsible decisions!",
            "If you're an social sciences major like I am ( and do not have an interest/ struggle in math or science fields) you'll have an easier time than Engineer majors. Math and science is no joke, but there is always academic support around! Classes are challenging, but meeting up with your TA/professor/mentor can always help your understanding on different subjects.",
            "1) Avoid eye contact on library walk. Everyday, students will be advertising for their fraternities, clubs and events. If you're not interested and are rushing to class, just walk with a purpose to avoid unwanted fliers or politely say no thank you, because no one likes to be disrespected either! 2) Meet other students and create study groups! They are extremely helpful and much easier to study for exam materials rather than cramming by yourself. No one likes a study buddy who does not contribute- do your share of the work too! 3) If you're worried about having friends at a new school, get out there and meet new people from different organizations you're interested in. You'll begin to meet people from different circles and also do productive things. Not everyone has the money, time or patience to join social fraternities or sororities. Campus clubs offer the same if not better social experience! You can also make new connections that could help you in a class you're taking or with a new job/internship.",
            "UCSD is in La Jolla, not San Diego- there's a big difference in the two environments where La Jolla has more wealthy, affluent people living nearby and San Diego has a more diverse population. People say UCSD stands for UC Socially Dead, but it's honestly what someone makes of their time here!"

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{250492=Revelle college has a tradition called the Watermelon Drop every year in June. They crown a Watermelon Queen (either gender), and they get to drop a watermelon off the roof of a building, aiming at a target on the ground. There is a small concert venue called the Che Cafe. There are many private concerts with beginner bands. It looks like a run-down shack, but the ambiance is comfortable and fun., 1048930=La Jolla Beach UTC Gas Lamp District Seaworld Mission Bay Old Town San Diego Balboa Park Del Mar Coronado Island, 880118=On campus, there are the gym facilities. Again like the food I would get off campus for the really world class recreation. If you are into martial arts, San Diego has a really famous fight community. Black House gym is right up Miramar Road and ATOS jiu jitsu is on Convoy. If you are more of a water sports type, the beach is a 5 minute walk away from the campus, 1126001=Great on Academics, mediocre on campus life, and truly terrible for students with disabilities. Parking for the handicapped is sparse, the transportation programs often make you late to class, and the Office for Students with Disabilities, while mainly staffed with great people, has a lady by the name of April Garrison who is evidently fond of making students obtain thousands of out of pocket dollars of extra testing despite the fact that they have doctors who state that they are in need of assistance. When I told her I did not have that kind of money, she callously suggested that I add to my already crippling student debt and borrow it. Easy for her to say., 818062=Like Dorm Life, depends on where you live. I live in Revelle, and the food is mediocre. You get the eventual hair in your food or find something that doesnt look appetizing, but hey, its a cafeteria. Just t mention, Revelle will be going through cafeteria renovation, so for the 2013-2014 school year, we will not have a cafeteria., 853203=There are plenty of interesting locations around campus. There is Falling Star, which is a small blue house that looks to be teetering on the edge of the engineering building; the talking, singing, and silent trees hidden in the forest near Geisel Library (which was the inspiration for the snow Fortress in Inception); the graffiti room in Mandeville; and much more! As for traditions, each of the six colleges has their own tradition, such as the Revelle Watermelon Drop and ERC's Rock n' Roosevelt. By far the biggest tradition of the year, however, is the Sun God festival in spring quarter, which is a huge concert/dance with a variety of artists, including famous artists like Kendrick Lemar and Macklemore., 1069118=Newly renovated dining plaza in Revelle College. Opens 2014 fall quarter., 842509=Some places on campus are better than others. UCSD is always improving their food and dining experience. They will be remodeling the lowest ranked dining hall in Summer 2013., 719113=UCSD has a bunch of art pieces that may seem random but they are done on purpose. There is a singing tree, a talking tree, and of course a silent tree. The is the Warren Bear in Warren College, which is a big bear made of huge rocks. During, welcome week freshmen students from each college participate in the unolympics, which is a set of competitions between the students of each college, like dancing and races.But really, the Sun God Festival is the big event that UCSD is known for. There are performances by famous artists like Drake, Young the Giant and Kendrick Lamar. Even more so there is a dance stage, activities, and food sold throughout the event. But the best thing is that undergraduates don't have to pay extra for it!! Your student fees cover the costs so your entry is free!, 488527=I am not sure what I will be doing for fun when I go to University of California, San Diego in Fall 2012, however, I am pretty sure I am will going to the beach and music dances to make for friends and have some time for myself to relax from my studies., 549799=Campus security is on 24/7 I feel safe even when I'm walking to my dorm at 11 o'clock at night., 419815=There is an annual Sun God festival in May in which many new artists come and perform! There are also many dance floors and food booths. On campus, there are also many random pieces of art including singing trees, a snake path, and a Sr. Seuss Statue., 251185=We are only a 20-minute walk from the beach and from the most beautiful places to hike and hang out. We also have many concerts on campus that are $10 or less. UCSD has a yearly music festival called Sun God, and we have famous musicians performing here! Last year, UCSD had Kendrick Lamar, Youngblood Hawke, and Portugal, the Man perform. They said that the upcoming years should be even better because of their large budget., 916237=You want to get at least above a 1800 for SATs if you already have good grades. If your grades are not that hot then you might want to score really high on the SATs. Public schools are all about numbers and your college essays. Extracurricular activities are important, but not as important as it would be in a private/liberal arts college. I'd say keep your grades up rather than relying on SATs. Most importantly you must show that you do better each year, rather than the other way around., 763566=I believe tuition has increased almost 100% since I began in 2005, which is both disheartening and discouraging. Luckily UCSD is a big enough name that finding lucrative work, even in this economy -- with the right experience, the right angle, the right attitude, and *definitely* the right connections -- shouldn't be too difficult., 939577=It's pretty expensive but I still have a few hundred left over every quarter with just a $2000 loan. Everything on campus is pretty pricey but with the dining plan given it balances out okay., 1130357=One of the most famous traditions is the Sun God Music Festival held every year in May where UCSD invites bands and artists to perform, and it is free for all UCSD students. Furthermore, the week before Finals Week is a tradition known as the Undie Run, where students run around campus in their underwear as a way to vent their stress. Also, the Stuart Art Collection is scattered throughout campus, so it's always neat to see randomly placed art (i.e. the Warren bear, the big red chair in Revelle, etc.)., 1125063=The school is excellent on academics, but poor on campus life, as UCSD was designed to be slightly alienating in order to discourage the kind of organized student protests that occurred at Berkeley. This is a shame, as student social life is an important part of any college experience. Driving on campus can be extremely slow and frustrating since they went mad and added enough stoplights to choke a horse. The old stop signs worked just fine, but evidently the administration, which is supposedly always strapped for cash, felt this a better use of their funds than putting the money into academics. However, mass transit is excellent until 10:30 PM. Other pluses include the location, as the college is near the beach, and located on a lovely campus.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Definitely tour the campus, and if you have an interest APPLY!!!! Utilize the resources this school has to offer. There are plenty of tools and opportunities, no excuses to not be having the time of your life in all respects! Bang for the buck With all I've said so far, I would hope that you would feel like you get your bang for the buck. Personally, I was astonished at how easily I transitioned into the college life, and that in itself is worth it to me. The life experiences I will gain here could not be duplicated anywhere else. Besides, who isn't in debt these days, and isn't that why we go to college in the first place? To make money to pay off our debts? That's what loans and scholarships are for. So one of the reasons I feel like UCSD is worth the pain of reaching deep into our wallets is HELLO! it's one of the top research institutes in the nation!!! We have multiple Nobel Prize winners just walking around the campus everyday. We are one of the top nationally funded research schools and you should definitely take advantage of that! Personally, within the third week of my Fall freshman quarter, I had a lab training position where I got PAID to learn how to work in a lab, and by Spring",
