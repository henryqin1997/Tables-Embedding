Samsung still put up a respectable showing, even as it lacked any major product introductions. The Galaxy S IV is set to be unveiled on March 14, which may give it a boost. HTC continues to see its fortunes decline and just said today that its sales in February plunged by 44% from a year ago. Google's (NASDAQ: GOOGL\u00a0\u00a0) Motorola subsidiary ranked No. 4 after giving up a modest percentage. The search giant likely isn't surprised at the decline, though, as CFO Patrick Pichette recently made some disparaging remarks about Motorola's product pipeline.
