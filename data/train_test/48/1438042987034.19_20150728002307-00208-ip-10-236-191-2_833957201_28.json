Bed was very comfortable, but you'll wake up at 4:35am to the daily garbage pickups. The rocking chair and ironing supplies in the room were nice touches, along with the fridge and microwave. A/C unit was unusually noisy and not very effective at controlling temperature & humidity. The ones in the hallways worked much better. A light above the table",
