I'm so excited about going to this school. I love the student body size and the courses offered., 31155=I enjoy MS&T for the most part, but there are a few things that aren't so great about it. The work load seems to really build up sometimes and the Male to Female ratio is 3:1 to name a few. Things like the annual St. Pat's celebration always make up for stuff like that though.}",

Tips for prospective students Missouri S&T may be continuing to renovate their dorms; if they are doing this the year you are to come in as a freshman, they may put you in the Rolla Inn (they've done this to us this year and the freshmen before me), an old Howard-Johnson inn.
