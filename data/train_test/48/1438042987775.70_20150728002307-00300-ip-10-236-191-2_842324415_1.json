After getting themselves back into the game shortly after the break, Wilson was particularly disappointed in his side's defending for Wycombe's second goal. \"Everything about that was bad defending,\" he said. \"It was a penalty, there's no argument. JP's taken too long on the ball and as it was coming down he should have hooked it away first time or headed it away, but he's waited and the boy's nicked it off him, and it's a penalty. Disappointing more than anything was that Dave saves it, and the first one to react to it was Ainsworth. That typified and summed us up, we were half a second short on things. We've allowed him to chip the ball to the back post and obviously he gets the header that goes in.\" Continuing to berate his side's defending, Wilson said: \"And not only that, just after 2-2 we've let three or four situations develop where they possibly could have scored again, and it's just rank-bad defending and rank-bad discipline throughout the side.\" \"Fair play to Wycombe, they stuck at it and got a result, but that's not my concern,\" said Wilson. \"We've really got to put them under pressure where they're feeling vulnerable and I don't think for one minute they felt vulnerable today apart from when we got our equalisers.\" The Swindon fans took their frustration out on the referee. The following extracts are taken from \"The Town End\" and Football Forums. System wrote: 'We were basically denied victory by the officials.' reeves4england wrote: 'Spoke to a Wycombe fan who was behind the goal and he said the ball didn't go in for their second. All in all, it sounds like we've been robbed, but 2-2 was still a fair result on the balance of play.' joteddyred wrote: 'Dodgy officials and bad luck played a part again today, but fundamentally we couldn't even muster a shot on goal in the first half.' Batch wrote: 'First half was hopeless hoofball - as bad as it's been all season. Second half was better. Not back to our best but we looked up for it. It also looked as if Wilson had told them to rough Wycombe up a bit to get the crowd going. The ref was a prize pr**k. The worst thing he did was book Marshall for being offside.' Red Is The Colour wrote: 'Overall, I'm disappointed not to have won, but I'm also relieved not to have lost. Lucas kept us in it good and proper today, proving why he's rated so highly. On another note, Paynter and Sheehan would probably have both been sent off had it been any other referee, Sheehan kept on and on at the officials, whilst Paynter clearly head butted their player.' adje wrote; 'Paynter was a bit lucky to stay on after head-butting their tw*t, but apart from that, he looked back to his best. How that cheating **** Ainsworth got man of the match, Christ knows. He was diving all game.' Nemo wrote: 'I thought Wycombe were pretty good. Gareth Ainsworth is clearly a class above and much too good to be relegated, and I think Revell showed that he'd have been a decent squad player here, if not a starter.' King of Tonga wrote: 'First half was sh*t. Second half was a cracking game. At half time I went and sat in the side stand and Paynter was a yard offside for our first goal. I know if you see the highlights he doesn't look it, but when the cross was taken he was off, I was dead in line. Was a brilliant second half - really enjoyable.' RJACK wrote: 'First half we were dire and never got out of 1st gear. Second-half it was all us. It got a bit meaty with Ainsworth going down all the time like a cheap wh*re, and Paynter was lucky to stay on after he head-butted their player, but then again, he did stamp on Paynter so it was six of one & half dozen of the other. Maybe both should have gone off. Ref & linesman totally ruined the game today and I hope that chump never referees again.'
