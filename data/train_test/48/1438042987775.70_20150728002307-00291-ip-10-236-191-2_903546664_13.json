They do take 10% of your financial aid to cover part it for you. Pro: 4 bedrooms + living room, it's like an apartment suite Two bathrooms, kitchen, and one small closet. Free wifi and cable Dorms do provide event once or twice a month, best to check out their bulletin board. They have a mail room (if you want your NCCC mail to come to you, best to go to the Record Office to allow it to happen). Security is 24/7 with a security guard, each hallway have key card to signal in order to get through, and the dorm's door is heavily and strong lock. You're more than likely to feel safe. You have a desk + chair, wardrobe, dresser, bed, furniture for the living room, and a shower curtain. Plus, electric oven, microwave, and a dishwasher. We have a few good lobbies to hang out, some have fireplace, one is like a small library with random books, and some entertainment lobby. Cons: Fire alarm sensor is very sensitive, best not to burn or smoke anything off. Fire alarm tends to happen a lot, best to be prepare to have your coat, keys ready to go as you go out the door. (There's about 6 alarm in the four bedroom, so no chances of missing that). Walls don't give you much quiet privacy, you'll be more than likely to hear people from hallways and outside of your windows. If you hear anything and they're disrupting your stay, then report it to the director. The director does lives with us on campus and usually supervises for certain event like a small holiday/occasion party. We do have Dorm RA being with us on the trip to malls or other places. There isn't much going on, so I would recommend checking out events that goes on campus - SPB (Student Programming Board) always have something going on once a week or so, depending on the occasions. There are other clubs too. So, I would recommend bringing your own games/video games/activities that you call fun. Other than that, they match you up with your roommates and my roommates are fun to be with.}",
