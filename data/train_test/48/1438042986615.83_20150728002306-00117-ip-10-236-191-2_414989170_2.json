During the first trip to this venue last season, it was the extremely long and technical rock section that played havoc with the riders. The jagged, volcanic rock found in the area creates large cracks and crevasses that swallow the wheels and intimidate even the best off road racers. KTM\u2019s Taddy Blazusiak will enter the series with a comfortable points lead but that does not mean that he can relax just yet. Monster Kawasaki\u2019s Taylor Robert has emerged as the best of the rest thus far this season and he seems to be on the verge of getting his first ever win after multiple second places finishes. And Mike Brown, the X Games gold medalist always has the speed to win. Beta\u2019s Cody Webb has been close to winning twice this season as well. Finally, Lucas Oil backed Colton Haaker proved he could win in Las Vegas and the Husqvarna duo of Kyle Redmond and Cory Graffunder are always a threat., 12287=2012 GEICO AMA EnduroCross Schedule, 10631=208.453.2222 ex 108}",
