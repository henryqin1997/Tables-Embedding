Establishment of conference calls, e.g., can be performed only when a call has already been established. A preferred function serving as the default function 42.1-42.n is designated in each of these groups. This designation may be performed by the programmer during programming, by the user through his redefinition of the default function, or by the phone itself in that it records the frequency of the use of the individual functions and appoints the most frequently used one in each group as the default function--optionally with the user's acceptance., 12721=The phones sold by the applicants as model Nokia 2110 and Nokia 8110 are exponents of the presently dominating user interface style based on two call handling keys. One of the keys is dedicated to call establishment, that is e.g. establishing a call based on a phone number displayed in the display, and answering an incoming call. The other key is dedicated to termination of an ongoing call and to rejection of an incoming call. This has been a standard for several years. However, the users ask for a more well-arranged and more manageable keypad., 19425=The processor 17, which serves as the controller unit in a manner known per se in the preferred embodiment, is connected to the user interface. Thus, it is the processor which monitors the activity in the phone and controls the display 3, 11 in response thereto. Therefore, it is the processor 17 which detects the occurrence of a state change event and changes the state of the phone and thus the display text. A state change event may be caused by the user when he activates the keypad, which is called an entry event, and also by the network connection of the phone or by another event beyond the user's control, which is called a non user event. Non user events comprise status change during call set-up, change in battery voltage, change in antenna conditions, message on reception of SMS, etc. The phone can assume a plurality of predetermined states 40.1-40.n, which is illustrated in FIG. 2. A plurality of actions (options 41.1-41.n) may be performed in these states 40.1-40.n. The display image on arrival at state 40.1 may be a phone number or the name of a person contained in the phone book of the phone, which is indicated by \"state\". \"State\" might also cover \"incoming calls\", \"E-mail received\", \"SMS received\", etc. If the display contains a phone number, the default function 42.1-42.n might be \"call\". The scroll key 9 allows switching from the default function to the group of possible functions to which the default function belongs. It is noted that, in the preferred embodiment, the scroll key 9 toggles between the default function and the group of possible functions (options), but switches between items in the group of possible functions once this group has been selected by means of the multi-functionality key. The state is maintained during toggling and scrolling through the options., 18077=FIG. 3 schematically shows the most important parts of a preferred embodiment of a portable phone. The preferred embodiment of the phone of the invention is adapted for use in connection with the GSM network, but, of course, the invention may also be applied in connection with other phone networks, such as cellular networks and various forms of cordless phone systems. The microphone 6 records the user's speech, and the analog signals formed thereby are A/D converted in an A/D converter 15 before the speech is encoded in an audio codec unit 14. The encoded speech signal is transferred to a physical layer processor 17, which i.a. supports the GSM terminal software. The processor 17 also forms the interface to the peripheral units of the apparatus, including the memories (RAM, ROM), the display 3 and the keypad 2 (as well as SIM, data, power supply, etc.). The processor 17 communicates with the RF part 19 via a baseband converter 18 and a channel equalizer 16. The audio codec unit 14 speech-decodes the signal, which is transferred from the processor 17 to the earpiece 5 via a D/A converter 13. The units 13-18 are usually integrated in a chip set, an example of such a commercially available chip set being AD20msp410 GSM from Analog Devices with associated protocol software from The Technology Partnership (TTP).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patentzitate In view of the foregoing description it will be evident to a person skilled in the art that various modifications may be made within the scope of the invention. The present invention includes any novel feature or combination of features disclosed herein either explicitly or any generalisation thereof irrespective of whether or not it relates to the claimed invention or mitigates any or all of the problems addressed. Although it has been shown in the preferred embodiment that the functions of the phone might very well be controlled by a single multi-functionality key including the call handling key, it may be found expedient in some cases to use separate keys for call handling and for menu access. This feature is of interest due to the fact that the number of the calling party is normally transferred to the called phone when the call is handled by digital telephone exchanges. If the number is stored in the phone book, the corresponding name will be displayed, and the user may divert the call if he does not want to answer, for example if he expects an important call. The CPU detects an incoming call in idle mode, and then an alert is given as a beep, ringing or a visual indication (silent mode). The phone enters an \"incoming call detected\" mode/state 23. The functionality of the multi-functionality key 8 and the \"c\" key 10 is answering the call and",
