The present invention is applicable to non-volatile memory devices, and more particularly to NAND flash memory devices. The circuit and method according to the present invention allow a NAND flash memory array to be erased and erase verified one page at a time, thereby providing flexibility to a user or programmer when selective erasure of any individual page of memory cells on a respective word line in any sector of the NAND array is desired. Therefore, the present invention obviates the need to erase a whole sector of multiple pages of memory cells in a NAND array and the need to subsequently rewrite some of the pages in the sector when not all pages of memory cells in the sector are desired to be erased.
