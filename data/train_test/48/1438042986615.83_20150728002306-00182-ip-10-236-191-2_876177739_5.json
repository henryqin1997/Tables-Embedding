Keenan continued to perform throughout the year with a revolving lineup, but most of the concerts were limited to the Southwest United States. That changed in the fall and winter of 2011 with a tour that covered much more of the U.S. Keenan has described Puscifer, among other things, as \"a playground for the various voices in my head.\" He has stated it is \"as much a clothing line as a band,\" albeit one with an actual discography of studio albums, remix albums, live albums and EPs. Among them are \"\"V\" is for Vagina,\" and the more recent \"Conditions of My Parole.\" As it stands, the Puscifer moniker came to light as a fictional outfit in the first episode of \"Mr. Show with Bob and David,\" a sketch comedy series that aired on HBO. For reasons unbeknownst to many, Adam Jones was named as a member of said band, though is not associated with Puscifer even though he appears on all its merchandise. If you flipped a coin and decided to name your band either Umlaut or Puscifer, which one would you choose? Maynard James",
