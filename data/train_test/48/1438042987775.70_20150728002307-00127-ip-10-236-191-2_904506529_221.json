Usually, after a winning home game, the student section will sprint across campus and run through the two fountains in celebration. It is especially great on hot days in august and september! Also, you have to make a stop at the discount den and buy a den pop (yes, we call it pop, not soda). A den pop allows you to mix different drinks together, all for a cheap price., 886002=There are over 1000 clubs on campus, I'm sure you can find something!, 168321=Definitely take a tour. This lets you get a feel for the dorms and how far they will be from your classes. If your from out of state, definitely ask about the weather. Several of my friends had to make emergency trips to Walmart because they didn't have any winter clothing. If you can, try leaving your winter clothes at home for the warm months, and then switching your wardrobe over a break, so that you don't bring more clothes than you have room for, because you won't need that cute turtleneck sweater in August., 1103428=When you apply, be creative and be yourself. Apply by November 1st so that you can be considered for Scholarships and Honors College., 124742=Friday night's before home football games there is a walk with the team over the bridge . The marching band plays for the crowd as they march through the campus before each home game ., 152267=Do not schedule classes before 8:30 am ever and meet as many people as possible. There are 20,000 different students at Purdue, surely there is someone that you can connect with and friends make the experience that much better!, 877891=Try and really reach out during BGR, but don't feel bad if you don't click with the people from your group! My best friends were ones that I met through my roommate. Also, if you want to get an apartment, sign in October to get the best choice! We signed early November, and we were almost too late!, 856517=I've only been there once, but it was a fun experience. I learned a lot about Purdue, and may attend this coming fall of 2013., 435076=hanging out with friends are always great, going to the union is a good option. you can bowl or play pool, or simply just have a cup of coffee and chat with friends. the new gym will be completed in the fall of 2012, so you will have a great new place to workout and play sports. joining a club is always a good idea, there's no better way to meet other people who likes what you like too., 1082302=Very safe environment. Police officers are always around. Here is Purdue 2012-2013 Annual Security Report: http://www.purdue.edu/police/pdf/YourCampus.pdf, 746097=With almost 1000 clubs to join Purdue is the place for working out and having fun. JThey also just built a new recreation center as well which boasts a ton of sporting facilities and equipment. There is always something to do at Purdue in the fun sense., 694910=I've walked around at 3:30 am and felt perfectly at home.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot I am in the nursing program and joined a learning community. This is where around 20 freshman nursing students get put in most of the same classes and are put in the same resident hall. This helps with finding people to study with and is a great way to easily make some new friends. Most of the programs have learning communities and I would recommend getting into one. It is not absolutely necessary for success in college but it might help make things a little bit easier.
