            "Miami offers many different meal plans and dining options, so you will find what you want! Although, if you grow tired of the on campus town, you can take a walk uptown where there are cafes among other options.",
            "The dorms are okay, in my opinion, for the freshman. They are a little bit small and with only a select few of dorms having air conditioning. I suggest that you bring and or rent an air conditioner. However, after seeing a bit of the sophomore dorms and Greek housing, it seems that as you progress up in years the choices do get better. But be warned though, you are required to stay on campus for two years. After those two years, some juniors and seniors move off campus to apartment style housing. However you do not have to live off-campus , you can stay on campus.",
            "Having only reviewing Miami and visiting campus, I can only say that they do offer many opportunities. For instance, they have a campus in Luxembourg in which you can transfer your credits and financial aid to attend. Moreover, they have a variety of majors that can fit for many people.",
            "I suggest scheduling a campus visit and try to sit in on a class. Going on a campus visit, for me, was the best decision in narrowing down my final choice. Looking at the nice brochures they send you will not tell if the school is for you. So go to the campus and ask yourself, Could I see myself here? , Do I feel comfortable?, and or Do I think I will get the best education possible?",

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{399283=Green Beer Day during the first week of March., 47589=Being at Miami, I have learned more than I expected. One reason being that every student is required to take Miami Plan courses, which contribute to Miami's liberal style of education. Not only have I learned more in college than I did high school, but the Miami Plan allows me to take a variety of different classes and learn things that I would not normally learn if I were to take classes that only pertained to my major/minor. For example, I took a southeast Asian art class fall semester 2010 and ended up learning about the different styles of art and along with the religions that go with them: Hinduism, Buddhism, etc. The second reason for my increased knowledge is quality of teaching that Miami provides. U.S. News rated Miami #2 in undergraduate teaching, meaning that the professors compare to those of some of the most prestigious schools in the country. In my experiences, the professors are a fantastic resource because they really focus on making sure that the students understand the information provided to them. Thus, I have been able to learn more in my classes and I feel vastly more educated than I did a year ago as a result of my professors being a great resource. What I love about Miami is how education can roll outside of the classroom. Miami offers undergraduate research, which is a very rare opportunity in undergraduate education. There are also seminars and guest speakers that visit Miami all the time. This past year, the Dalai Lama visited and spoke to students and other guests, which was extremely educational because I was able to learn things from a religious leader's perspective., 768648=On campus are various seals that you can NEVER step on or fail your exams, there is a sundial in the center of campus that you're supposed to rub before your exams to ensure you ace them, but the best (and maybe cutest) of all is the famous arch. On valentines day especially, it is said that if you kiss someone under the Upham Hall archway then you two will be happily in love forever. Needless to say, there is always a line there on February 14th. Then there is a somewhat shocking reality on campus, the sport of choice here is not football, basketball or the usual high school stars--it's hockey. Nationally ranked nearly every year, Miami Hockey is a very, very big deal. Every student waits in line for days before each home game to get tickets and cheer on the Redhawks., 445101=Being that it's an old school, Miami has many traditions. 1809, remember that. That's the year Miami was founded. Commit it to memory. DO NOT STEP ON THE SEAL. It doesn't matter if you fail your next exam or not. It's a matter of respect. So just don't. If you've found love at this school (and you might since our marriage rate is 33%) make sure to give your sweetheart a kiss under the Upham Arch at midnight and you'll be sure to tie the knot. Oh, and if your a male student living in Peabody Hall, watch out for Helen Peabody, or rather her ghost, she's not a fan of guys., 494559=If you want to know where you will be living prior to three weeks before move-in, I would suggest finding a roommate and not going random because they won't give out random roommates until the end of July., 819004=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 677076=Overall, the food is good, but by the end of second semester you never want to eat it again. Try the salads at Dividends in the Farmer School of Business-- they are my favorite! Also, Bell Tower and 1809 are good places to eat on campus with the meal plan! I try to avoid the all you can eat dining halls as much as possible., 504045=Our school was established in 1809, so there are many traditions on this campus. Take a tour, or look on the website to look at all the cool history we have.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Demitrios from Chicago, IL 11/08/2010 Reviewer is A current student here. 12 out of 13 people found this review useful. 2 of 167 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Students here are strikingly similar. There is a reason Miami is labeled J. Crew U. Almost all are upper-middle class and affluent, and a high percentage of the student population is caucasian. However, students are typically well-rounded, generally show support for Miami athletics, friendly and open-minded. I think anyone could fit in here. Tips for prospective students 1. Bringing a bike might be a good idea as it makes going uptown or even traveling to class more manageable. 2. Get involved early on--there are numerous organizations and clubs and it is a great way to meet people. 3. Explore the beautiful and scenic Ohio landscape surrounding the campus. 4. Don't expect a lot from the town--the university is the town. Bang for the buck As an out-of-state student, the tuition was a little steeper than I would have liked, but it is not",
