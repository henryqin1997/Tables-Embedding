The main areas of my research are encapsulation and controlled release of active chemicals. I use direct write assembly to produce encapsulating filament or droplet shells that surrounds an active core. In addition, I use microfluidic systems to create emulsion droplets to serve as encapsulating agents. The materials used to encapsulate can be made of responsive chemicals that allow for a controllable release of the core. Josh Grolman University of Massachusetts, BS Our goal is to develop novel materials for targeted release of actives: mainly focused on macromolecular synthesis and characterization toward new, structured materials and nano-scale devices. Using microfluidic devices, we are able to possess fine control over hierarchal material composition and order, and develop materials with special 'smart' surface functionalities in a high-throughput format. It is at the interface, where much fascinating science remains to be discovered.",
