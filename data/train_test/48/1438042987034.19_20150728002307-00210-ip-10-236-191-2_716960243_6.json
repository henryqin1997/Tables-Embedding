Thank you for removing this crappy post. I really like this site and have found a lot of great deals here. We are going to have to work together to keep this site from getting junked up by these ridiculous posts by clicking the \"report a problem\" link on the page and ask for the post to be deleted because its a rip off. Every time a \"rip off\" like this is posted a potentially good/great deal is bumped off to make room for it. up 0 votes",
