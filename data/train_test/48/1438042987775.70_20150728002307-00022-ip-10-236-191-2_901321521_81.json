            "It may seem like Marquette may not be located in a safe area, but most students feel incredibly safe while on campus and in dorms. Marquette spends the most money in the country in terms of campus safety. Limos pick students up starting at 5 p.m. throughout the night to drive students anywhere on campus so they do not have to walk late at night.",
            "Greek life is small at Marquette, but it is still present. Fraternities and Sororities exist, but there is no distinct Greek Row.",
            "Marquette has close to 300 student organizations. Everyone is bound to find something that interests them here.",
            "Marquette is great for students who wish to excel not only academically, but also as a whole person. Marquette will provide its students with all tools necessary to live a successful life in all aspects.",
            "Marquette has a campus turkey that can be spotted roaming around campus. Where else can you find a turkey in the middle of an urban city?",
            "Coming to Marquette is well worth the hefty price tag that comes with it. Not only will you acquire an excellent, well-recognized degree upon graduation, but you will leave Marquette as a different person: a better, more well-rounded person. Marquette is worth every penny invested.",
            "Marquette lies in the center of Milwaukee with an abundant amount of opportunities! Stroll the path along Lake Michigan, visit a museum, attend a concert at the Rave or the Pabst Theater, or stay on campus for some Late Night Marquette Events. Does Humans Vs. Zombies interest anybody?",
            "The food at Marquette could be a little better. The dining hall food isn't always the healthiest, but hot cookie night is an essential. You've never had a hot cookie quite this good!",
            "The dorms are Marquette each have their own sort of personality. It's always fun going to other dorms and seeing what their lifestyles are like. The dorm life is what you make out of it!",
            "Depending on the classes you take, Marquette's classes require a hefty workload, so prepared to study! Be sure to make some time for yourself though.",
            "Know how to take good notes! Note-taking skills can be learned while in college, but it is better to know what works best for you before coming to Marquette. Also, tour campus and listen to what the current students have to say. It may seem stereotypical, but what the current students tell you about their experiences is actually true!",
            "Marquette University encompasses all elements of the ideal college scene in one campus. Academics at Marquette are challenging, yet inspiring and exciting all at once. Aside from academics, Marquette has an outrageous amount of school spirit leading to a great sense of community."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{263588=Food at MU is by far one if it's best aspects. There are no meal plans here, everyone can eat as much as they want! There are three regular dining halls: Straz, McCormmick, and Cobeen. Mashuda is a '50's diner themed hall and Schroeder is an Italian themed hall. The Union has a bunch of different things like a coffee shop, subs, sushi, Mexican, burgers, salad bar, and a bagel place. The only down side to the food is that McCormmick and Schroeder are the only dorms open past 6:30 PM., 464963=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 238067=If you are thinking about Marquette, apply early, before Dec. 1st. If you are worried about paying for this school, work over the summer during high school, apply for private scholarships, and do well in high school (for a incoming freshman, 4-year scholarship offer from Marquette). If you did not attain a high GPA in high school, but do while during your first semester at Marquette, you may be able to ask them to increase your incoming freshman scholarship/grants. It will take time and effort to pay for this school (without any help from your parents) if you come from a low-income background, but if you are dedicated to working hard here, your efforts will be rewarded (trust me, I know)., 74434=The classes are tough but they are really informative. They challenge you to think critically as well as look past the basic information given and how you would apply that to your job. There are classes that everyone has to take like English 1001, Theology, Philosophy, and a science elective, but they are extremely helpful. Also, the teachers know that you would rather be anywhere but in class so they make their classes as interesting as possible and talk about current things that could relate to the topics you are talking about., 430330=Watch application dates and be patient. Very competetive selection process. When I applied, I was one of 22,000 students competing for 2000 spots. I had a 3.8 GPA and a 37 ACT and was weight-listed for the nursing program. I was eventually accepted., 371162=Tons of different choices and types of dining halls. You have traditional buffet styles, an Italian restaurant style, 50's dinner, 4 coffee shops, and a healthy dining hall. With the meal plan you have unlimited swipes for certain halls so you will never go hungry. The downsides would be that most halls close by 6 or 6:30 which is a bit early for the busy college kid.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Going into my first year of college I was worried I wouldn't be fully prepared for the academic side of school. But when I got there that fear went straight out of my mind. All of my professors were extremely helpful in the transition from high school to college life. The courses were not easy and I had to work hard, but through working hard on my own and with the professors, who really make themselves available to their students, I was able to understand all of the advanced concepts they were teaching in class. I felt so much more intelligent returning home after my first semester. I was able to engage in actual adult conversations with my parents and their friends because I was well informed and understood what was going on. It was an incredible feeling and I don't know how I could have lived without it for so long.
