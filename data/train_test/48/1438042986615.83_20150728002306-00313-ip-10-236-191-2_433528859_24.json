He joined his father Olly, brother Harry and family friend Will Goodwin, on a bike ride from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for SOBS, who provided great support after the family tragically lost their wife and mother, Fee, in 2005. Taylor qualifies for Scotland on account of his late mother. ESPNcricinfo staff, 76765=4391 runs after 35, and 2354 outside top five (43), 51685=Rob Taylor acquired a place in Scottish cricketing folklore for his performance against Kenya in a critical World Cup Qualifier in January 2014. Taylor entered with Scotland 169/6, needing 92 from 12.5 overs to reach the third World Cup. His unbeaten 46, from only 37 balls, secured Scotland's passage to Australia and New Zealand., 75843=Since the beginning of 2012, Ian Bell averages 34.69 when batting in the top six; among regular top-order batsmen, only Shane Watson has a lower average, 57886=May 28, 2015, 52701=A left-handed batsman and left-arm seam bowler, Taylor completed his studies at Loughborough in 2012 and made significant contributions with the ball in both the CB40, in which he was the Foxes' leading wicket-taker with 11 victims, and Friends Life t20, where he had an economy rate of 6.91., 52122=Born in Northampton and a product of Harrow School, Taylor made his debut for Leicestershire's Second XI in May 2008 at the age of 18. But it was three years later when he was pitted against his own county that he began to make himself noticed. He compiled a match-saving unbeaten century as Loughborough MCCU secured a draw in a three-day match at Grace Road, quite a job application. On his first-class debut for Leicestershire against Surrey at Grace Road in August of the same year, he hit 70 in the first innings and took 3 for 53., 68247=The Cricket Monthly: The IPL lasts two months, but through the year talent hunters are scouring India (and the internet) for the next big thing.

He performed a similar role for Leicestershire, proving himself a useful cricketer in all three formats for the struggling county., 26252=Born December 21, 1989, Northampton}",
