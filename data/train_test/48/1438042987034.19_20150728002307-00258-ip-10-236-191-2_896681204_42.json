It is a university that challenges and encourages students to do their best in both academia and working field, with a supportive staff and students."

Tips for prospective students Stick with it. The only thing i regret this year is backing out of somethings i shouldn't have. The best way to become a solid college student is to get involved. The rate of drop out students increses when they don't get involved with the UCD community. And if you're going to drop out it's just a waste of money. And trust me if you're a broke college student the thought of losing money makes you want to cry. Just",
