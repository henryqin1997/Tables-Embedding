I had to know what it was, just the sound I was yearning to hear. So I Shazamed it, and it came up, previewed the rest of the album, which is solid and bought it. To think if I had not been at the right place at the right time I may have not ever heard of this gem, I'm sure glad I did. Top Albums and Songs by Michael Hackett 1.",
