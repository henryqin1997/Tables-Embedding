            "Pitt is a great school for any Pre-Medicine or Pre-Health major. Pitt is affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh Medical School and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which can help prospective medical students out alot. I received a job during my first semester at a laboratory and it has given me amazing exposure as a Pre-Med major that I would not have had access to at any other university or college",
            "Come visit campus. I did not really want to attend Pitt until I visited campus and found out how beautiful the campus was. You would think that since Pitt is in a city, it is busy and dirty and disgusting but it is funny to see all the people that come to Pitt and are surprised how beautiful, clean, and green the campus really is.",
            "I think that even for all that the University of Pittsburgh has to offer, it costs too much to attend here. The tuition keeps rising and the students don't seem to be gaining any more benefits. With that said, Pitt does provide students with an exceptional education and many different activites to do on campus.",
            "The University of Pittsburgh is located in the Oakland district of Pittsburgh and is surrounded by museums, art galleries, and even a botanical conservatory. It is a short walk to Schenley Park which has its own golf course and also just a bus ride away from downtown Pittsburgh where there are even more things to do.",
            "The classes here at Pitt are very interesting and stimulating. Not only have I learned new things but I have also found interests in subjects I never thought I would enjoy. Pitt has a large number of classes to pick from, the choices are endless! You can find everything from Introductory Italian to Islamic Civilization to Mesoamerica Before Cortez to Introduction to Western Architecture and those are just 4 out of hundreds of classes to pick from."

It might not be New York or L.A., but it's pretty close and has just about everything you'd expect from a city., 751244=Put yourself out there as much as you can in your first week. It's a big school and is easy to get lost in, so being involved can really make your experience 1000 times better., 415963=I feel very safe. Especially after the bomb threats during the Spring of 2012 semester., 270404=There's a lot of review in most below-1000-level classes if you've taken a course on it before (in high school, for example) but it's worth it and the teachers do build on it. Once you get to the upper levels it's mostly new knowledge., 170674=At the University of Pittsburgh, there is a large Arena called the Peterson Events Center, otherwise known as the Pete. There is a large field outside right outside there and every year, Univ. of Pittsburgh plans an event for Freshman students to break a world record of some sort. This past year of 2012, Univ. of Pittsburgh Class of 2016 broke the world record of the largest uniformed dance with umbrellas dancing to the Cupid Shuffle for 6 minutes. This field is also known by students to play Ultimate Frisbee, Croquet, Football, Volleyball, Tanning, etc., 526885=Definitely study, study, study. Join as many clubs as you can handle in high school. Keep your GPA above a 3.5, and aim for at least a 1200 on the math and reading section of the SAT, and you will be guaranteed entrance to the University., 1013494=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 601016=The Cathedral of Learning (42 stories, 535 feet tall, 2529 windows) is the largest academic building in the United States. The building is Pitt's landmark and provides wonderful views of campus from the Unversity Honors College on the 35th and 36th floors., 220278=If you're in-state, you're definitely getting a good deal. Pitt is just as good as private schools that charge twice as much. Obviously the out of state tuition is one of the highest in the country, but I still think it's a pretty decent deal. You get so many opportunities that small schools don't offer. The free bus pass alone retails for over $1600.}",

Tips for prospective students My freshman year was one of the most rewarding and trying years of my life. I was lucky enough to join a learning community my first semester and got to know a group of students very well. The diversity of the student and city population is the best part of Pitt and it is reflected in its student group offerings. There is something/someone for EVERYONE if you look for it. The free bus pass with your Pitt ID was the best perk of being a student, however, you have to stay on top of your work. If you let your coursework slip by, you will not be able to catch up. Pitt is the most academic challenging and rewarding state school but I",
