    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{17889=The paint compositions of this invention may be produced by using, as the thermoplastic resin components, 100 parts by weight of at least one aliphatic hydrocarbon resin and 2.5-40, preferably 5-30 parts by weight of at least one ethylene-vinyl ester copolymer. If less than 2.5 parts by weight of the ethylene-vinyl ester copolymer are used in the melt bonding type road marking paint compositions to be produced, the resulting paint compositions will not exhibit an improved fluidity when melted nor will they give coatings having an improved impact strength and flexibility, thereby rendering the paint compositions undesirable as such. If, on the other hand, more than 40 parts by weight of the ethylene-vinyl ester copolymer are used, the resulting road marking paint compositions will exhibit an improved fluidity but give coatings having a reduced hardness and a decreased wear resistance as well as tackiness on the surface, thereby making the paint compositions unsuitable as such., 24779=The aliphatic hydrocarbon resins which may be used in this invention should be those having a softening point of from 70\ufffd to 160\ufffdC, preferably 80\ufffd-140\ufffdC. If paint compositions contain an aliphatic hydrocarbon resin having a softening point of lower than 70\ufffdC, they will exhibit a satisfactory fluidity but will give coatings which decrease in hardness after solidified, thereby rendering the paint compositions unsuitable as road marking ones. The hydrocarbon resins according to this invention are not particularly required to have any other specified properties although it is recommended that they should have usually a Gardner color of not higher than 8 (ASTM D. 1544-63T) and an iodine value of 20-200 (Wijs method)., 17602=These objects may be accomplished by compounding, by weight, 100 parts of an aliphatic hydrocarbon resin, 2.5-40 parts of an ethylene-vinyl ester copolymer, 20-100 parts of a pigment and 80-500 parts of a filler to form a hot-melt type road marking paint composition., 25520=On the other hand, the ethylene-vinyl ester copolymers which may be used in this invention are those comprising 90-50% by weight of ethylene and 10-50% by weight of a vinyl ester and having a melt index of 1.5-1000 (g/10 min.). The vinyl esters used for the formation of the ethylene-vinyl ester copolymers include vinyl esters represented by the formula ##EQU1## wherein R is an alkyl group having one to four carbon atoms, such as vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl butyrate and vinyl valerianate, with vinyl acetate being the most recommendable.}",
