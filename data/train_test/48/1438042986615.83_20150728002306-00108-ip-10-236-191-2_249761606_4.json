We also list lesson plans that can either be used as an introduction to Cosmic Times as a whole or that are appropriate to be used with any of the posters. The other sections of the Teachers' Guide give background information about the articles in each Cosmic Times issue. In addtion, those pages list lesson plans designed specifically to accompany the science topics within that particular issue of Cosmic Times. The Cosmic Times newspapers tell the history of our understanding of the changing Universe through student readings tracing the major discoveries in cosmology over the past century. Each poster resembles the front page of a newspaper from a particular time in this history, with articles about the various discoveries.

This activity provides students an introduction to the material on the Cosmic Times posters. It may also be used to foster student discussion about a particular Cosmic Times subject. x x Physics, Astronomy, Multi-disciplinary Cosmic Times Jigsaw Students work in teams to see the big picture of about how scientists have come to know what they do about the Universe using articles from the Cosmic Times posters. x x Mult-disciplinary Century Timeline Students create a timeline of world events from 1905 through 2006, the years encompassed by the Cosmic Times posters, to get a sense of the history surrounding the discoveries over the past century. x x Multi-disciplinary Reading Strategies Students learn several reading strategies that can be used to understand the Cosmic Times materials, and other readings that may be challenging to them. x x Multi-disciplinary Cosmic Times Home Teacher Resources",
