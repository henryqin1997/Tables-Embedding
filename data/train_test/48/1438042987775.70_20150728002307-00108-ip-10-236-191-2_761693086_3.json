For a start, Flinders Street Station as we know it wasn't there in 1886 (it didn't open until 1910). St Paul's Cathedral didn't have its spires (construction started in 1926). And Federation Square - 10 years old this weekend - wasn't even a twinkle in a town planner's eye. So where does the view come from? It's an ingenious mash-up of the real and the fake, or as digital effects producer Scott Zero puts it, of the ''practical'' and the ''digital''., 29074=Based on a best-selling novel released in 1886 by Englishman Fergus Hume, the murder mystery is richly descriptive of the city in which the author was then working as a barrister's clerk.}",
