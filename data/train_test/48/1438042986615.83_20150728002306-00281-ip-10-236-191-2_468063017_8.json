    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As embodied above, if a function switch is ON for a predetermined interval, sub-functions corresponding to the function switch are displayed at a certain interval, so the user may select a desired sub-function easily. In case of a special sub-function, it is displayed for a longer time, so the user can select special sub-function more easily. Consequently, the present invention can provide a function camera display system and that allows the user to be informed of all the functions by displaying all the functions at a certain interval and to select one of the functions conveniently by providing a predetermined interval before a function is changed. If both the flash function switch S1 and the photographing function switch S2 are OFF, the CPU 10 sets up a basic photographing function. And then photographs are taken according to user's release signal (Step 580), and processing terminates (Step 590). In the above-mentioned process, if the flash function switch S1 is OFF, the CPU 10 determines whether the photographing function switch S2 is ON (Step 500). If the photographing function switch S2 is ON, the CPU 10 processes the signal from the S2 switch in a manner analogous to the processing of the signal from the S1 switch described above (Steps 510-570). If the set-up flash sub-function is not a special flash sub-function, it is changed into another sub-function and another sub-function is displayed at the function display unit",
