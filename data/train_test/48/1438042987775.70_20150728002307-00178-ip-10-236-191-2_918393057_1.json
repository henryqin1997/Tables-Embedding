            "You don't need to take the CLM placement exam unless your major requires you to take Calculus. It'll save you $40 (up to $50 with a make-up exam). Buy your textbooks online, it's cheaper. If you're looking for a meal plan, choose the Sensible 6. You get 6 meals a week, plus $450 in Flex, which you can spend in the Atrium (or pay cafeteria) and C-Store (mini campus grocery store). Believe me, it's more than enough.",
            "Unfortunately, there are occasions where Ramapo will rip you off. For example, if you're planning to take a foreign language class, you'll have to pay a $50 lab fee. Class isn't actually held in the lab; the fee is used to cover the possibility of you needing to use the lab if you have any questions. Ramapo also likes to charge an absurd amount of money for mandatory placement exams, and even more money if you do poorly on said exam and want to take it over. Fortunately, the positives outweigh the negatives. Because Ramapo is a state school, tuition isn't as ridiculous as that of private colleges. For that money, you get clean and well-furnished dorm rooms (except maybe Linden and Pine), good food, a beautiful campus, and a solid education.",
            "I love being at Ramapo. It gives me the opportunity to dorm, while still being able to go home on the weekends. If you're into nature, the Ramapo Reservation is the place for you. If you're not (like me), you can still enjoy yourself by taking a bus or train into the city (as in NYC), or to one of the many malls nearby. The people on campus are generally very pleasant, especially the employees working in the dining halls. It's really not difficult at all to make friends.",
            "Being a communications major, I frequently receive comments from my friends that school is a joke for me. I can see where they're coming from, seeing as I never have to take Calculus or Organic Chemistry. However, it's not as though I am not learning anything. Just this semester, I have learned how to use Adobe Photoshop, Dreamweaver, and InDesign - three programs crucial that I know for my future career. Also, the school's mandatory general education courses assure that I get a well-rounded education."

Even though it's a public campus, it has a very private feel. Most of the amenities are state of the art including the gym located in the Bradley Center as well as the residence halls that make you feel as if you're living in luxury. I feel as though the amount of money I have invested into Ramapo will truly pay off when I graduate in May of 2013. More importantly, many former students love this place so much that they end up working as full time faculty and administrators within the college., 192159=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 175826=The campus's many Greek organizations not only include social fraternities and sororities, but many professional fraternities as well. Alpha Kappa Psi Business Fraternity was introduced at Ramapo in 2012-13 and has quickly become a favorite among those who want a co-ed Greek experience at Ramapo. For those who stick to social Greek life, the many fraternities and sororities have something for every student to enjoy.}",
