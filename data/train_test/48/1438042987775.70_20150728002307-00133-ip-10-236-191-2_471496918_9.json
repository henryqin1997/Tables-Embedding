    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{67977=FIG. 12 is an illustration of a generic block circuit diagram for a sensor element readout circuit 1200. Negative feedback assures that the voltage on a feedback line 1201 is the same as the oscillating voltage V0 produced by a reference 1203. The output from a sensor element 1205 is the signal voltage \u0394V superposed on the reference voltage V0. The output line plus a reference voltage line provide a differential signal output voltage \u0394V., 68488=FIG. 13 illustrates a projective-capacitive sensor element for use with the circuit of FIG. 12. A variable capacitor 1301 represents the projective-capacitive sensor electrode. In use, a user's finger or other grounded object causes the capacitance to ground to be increased. A resistor 1303 supports the readout scheme. Resistor 1303 can either be built directly into the sensor or located with the readout electrodes., 68948=The feedback circuit illustrated in FIG. 12 can also be used with the alternating current readout of a force sensor. Some force sensors, for example those manufactured by C-Cubed Limited, are read out via a Wheatstone bridge. Thus, as shown in FIG. 14, one or more of the four resistors 1401-1404 may correspond to piezoresistive elements in the force sensor. In the embodiment shown, the bridge is connected to ground via a capacitor 1405. Although capacitor 1405 is not required, it may useful for reducing the differences between the excitation and feedback voltages, thereby making the ratio of \u0394V to V0 more similar to signals from the projective-capacitive electrodes.}",
