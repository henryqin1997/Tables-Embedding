            "Very safe. A policeman is biking around campus 24/7 to ensure safety.",
            "There's no Greek life, but there are honor societies with Greek names for exceptional students.",
            "There's a club and activity for anyone and everyone.",
            "All students: especially those looking for a small, private, liberal arts setting wishing to grow in faith with Christ.",
            "The ADC (caf) used to be underground, but not anymore.",
            "Exceptional academics, opportunities, and facilities. The price is so expensive, so I docked off one star for that purpose.",
            "Being in Riverside, there's mountains, beaches, hills, mountains, and a desert all together (with 30 minutes distance). you can bike, swim, climb, or simply hang out at local cafes. It's to your advantage that Riverside has everything any college student can ask for. It's both metropolitan (in the city) yet suburban (homely) at the same time. This school offers the best of everything.",
            "Phenomenal food ranging from Asian food, Mediterranean, Italian, pizza, and sushi. There's something new daily, everything is beyond delicious.",
            "CBU has two options for freshman housing: cottages and dorms. The cottages is very unique in that there's a courtyard and porches, while offering everything a dorm has. They're both very traditional.",
            "The academic rigor is set perfectly. It's not so demanding that students get stressed or confused, but enough to challenge students to think rigorously and make an honest effort to achieve good grades. The challenging academic environment, along with the professors who are professionals in their field makes the education so much more worthwhile.",
            "Take advantage of all the resources CBU has to offer. CBU is known for having a plethora of faith-based opportunities, so engaging in ministry or learning from your peers will always be an option if you're interested in learning more about Christ. Finally, the school is especially known for its renowned International Service Projects, where you preach about Jesus in other countries-- it's an eye-opening experience allowing all participants to grow closer to God.",
            "California Baptist University offers everything any students could ask for: a world-class teaching facility, recreational and intramural sports, an academic resource center, a career services center, on top of an intimate, close-nit community ready for a hands on learning environment. As the only Baptist university in the state of California, it offers a faith-based education, fully integrated in all classroom settings. California Baptist University is an up and coming school offering astounding food, great safety, and an abundance of resources so that all students can achieve future goals."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{129352=the classes here are great. they the teacher to student ratio is about 1:21 but it is actually a lot smaller if i might add. i had one class with only 6 students! and trust me that is awesome. it might depend on the major you are also, but so far i have had only one class that was somewhat large and that was a general education class that is popular on campus, it is called marine science., 198016=Best college cafeteria food ever. Sunday brunch is to die for. People actually come from off campus to eat in out cafeteria. There is also a restaurant called Briscios that offers sandwiches, and salads. There is a new restaurant opening fall 2012 that is going to offer different types of pasta. All of these are options that use the meal plan., 94607=The facilities, classes, professors, food, student body, and the school itself are all fantastic. There are buildings that are still standing from when the school was founded in 1954, but they are all standing strong, and are diligently maintained. In addition to buildings that were there originally, California Baptist University has purchased much of the land around it, and continues making renovations on existing buildings, as well as recently built facilities, and buildings that are being constructed., 463048=On campus, one can visit the game room and play ping pong, pool, shuffleboard, or Foosball. There is also a recreational center being built which will have workout equipment, a pool, an above ground track, a rock climbing wall, and much more. This is projected to open in the spring of 2013., 39258=Woo fest, March Madness and the Man Auction are all great traditions and so much fun to participate in!, 246543=The CBU crazies march during homecoming, there are several cool spots too! For example, there is the fortuna fountain, the catacombs( unfortunately you cannot go down in them) and the front lawn in general is nice., 658978=There are many events on campus for the residence and commuter students. If any events are coming up there will be posters around campus, people will tell you during Chapel, your RA will post things in the living area and you can check lancermail to see what is going on. There are service events to help out the community and hang out with friends. During September we have TWIRP week were the girl ask the boys on dates the entire week. Also have midnight madness, christmas chapel and etc. Next semester we have WOO! same as TWIRP but instead the boys ask the girls and woo there affection. Just a munch of events to connects everybody together and meet new people., 25803=There are tons of fun things to do on campus at any given moment. I enjoy spending my free time playing Futsol(street soccer) with friends or having late night jam sessions with my band, or even just kicking back and watching a movie at amc with a 7$ ticket bought from campus life. Oh and did i mention that the mountians and beach are only 45 min away? Wooo! 4:1 ratio!, 322308=A very friendly environment. The staff as been awesome in helping me along the way for the 2012-2013 school year. I'm so excited for what the future has for me at cbu., 533345=Despite it's hefty price tag, I've only have had to pay 1200 out of my own pocket. I feel like I'm paying for Cal State tuition. :) Which is a plus. However, make sure you're able to pay for 2/3 of the tuition. If you end up having to pay for more than $10,000 through your own pocket, and loans, do not attend Cal Baptist. You'd be better attending another college or university. Also, only take out Federal Subsidized loans (and not even a single unsubsidized loan). Private loans will haunt you if you take them out. Believe the horror stories you read about those taking out private loans., 255431=They do TONS of free and fun stuff. On November 1st to kick off Homecoming they were able to get Switchfoot to come and gave out like 600 FREE TICKETS!!! AND!! The concert was in our very own gym! And for midnight madness instead of just regular tickets they gave out CBU watches., 23013=No frats sorry, but tons of great clubs! Baking club for example............4:1 ratio!, 734003=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Be prepared to study, write papers, and read more than you ever have before. Throughout my previous years in school I maintained a high grade point average, but I still have to work very hard to maintain such a high GPA in college. Do your best to get involved in at least one sport, club, or bible study group. The friendships, memories, and values you'll gain are life-changing and it will make you feel home away from home. Bang for the buck I will admit that CBU is very expensive, but so is every other private university. The christian environment, caring professors, and lifelong friendships you'll make guarantee that the high cost of enrolling at CBU is truly worth every penny! Am enjoying being here I am still amazed everyday at how much of a blessing it is to be attending CBU and to be able to live on campus. The faculty is so friendly and helpful. Even my professors truly care about my grade and they strive for me to succeed. The professors really care about you as a person and they are available to help with school or even things that aren't school-related. I love my school and I can't imagine being anywhere else! Am",
