            "You can take a good amount of classes, if you schedule permits, for a very minute amount of money.",
            "The little caf\u00c3?\u00c2\u00a9 is nice, and the coffee is really good. It is also half off on Mondays.",
            "There are no dorms at NMSU- Carlsbad",
            "This school is not very rigorous at all. I was a B student in high school and I have all A's in my classes. Teachers do not give a lot of homework but the homework they do give, amounts for a lot of your grade.",
            "I would advise prospective students to take advantage of all the teachers' office times, and get help before you are failing a class. Also, there are many tutoring services one can take advantage of.",
            "The campus is really small, yet it still provides a college atmosphere. The teachers are very nice, and are always willing to help their students. It is like any other college, but is actually a junior college."

Depending on what courses you require you will get a good learning experience out of this college and not so much a waste of money. Food and Dining No food and dining available here. Dorm Life There are no dorms for it's a community college. Academic Rigor A lot of the professor's are great and it's a very one on one environment. Tips for prospective students Know what classes you want and are required. The adviser's aren't always helpful and you could end up taking a class that you didn't need.
