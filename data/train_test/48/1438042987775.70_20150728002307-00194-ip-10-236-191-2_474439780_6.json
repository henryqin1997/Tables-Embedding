No. 5,650,917, issued to Hsu on Jul. 22, 1997, relates to a Central Processing Unit (CPU) mounting structure that includes a U-shaped mounting frame mounted on an electrical connector that receives a CPU card. The CPU card is held in the U-shaped mounting frame by two holding down devices, i.e., screws. The mounting structure, which is intended for use with CPUs, makes unusable a sizeable amount of space on the circuit board as the U-shaped structure extends on three sides of the board. The U-shaped structure also does not allow interface access to the printed circuit card on the sides., 27870=Several patents have issued in an attempt to cope with some of these problems. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,603,628, issued to Schapiro, Jr. on Feb. 18, 1997, relates to a retainer for printed circuit cards that combines a set of anchors located on both sides of a connector and an adjustable tie device, (i.e., tie-wrap), that extends around both sides of the card and engages the connector to secure the card to the connector. The adjustable tie device allows the retainer to be used with cards of different height. However, because the tie device extends over both sides of the printed circuit card, it invariably rests on the various printed circuit card components that are necessary for the proper functioning of the card. As a result, repeated connection and disconnection of the tie device may damage the card., 29348=Yet another example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,826,447, issued to Forker et al. on May 2, 1989, relates to a retainer for locking a printed circuit board with an edge connector that is directly soldered to the conductive paths on a second circuit board. The circuit board is permanently connected to the connector and is removable only after disengaging the retainer and desoldering the electrical connections to the second circuit board. The retainer, which does not allow interface access to the printed circuit card on the sides, requires a large surface area of potentially usable circuit board space.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is to be understood and expected that additional variations in the principles of construction herein disclosed may be made by one skilled in the art and it is intended that such modifications, changes, and substitutions are to be included within the scope of the present invention. In addition, while the application of the present invention to computer equipment, such as PC's and computer servers, is unmistakable, the present invention may apply to any type of electronic equipment where two discrete printed circuit cards are electrically connected. This includes, but is not limited to, telecommunications equipment such as line interface cards, transceivers, power modules, and switch modules. Sixth, the notches 8 need not be cut through the printed circuit card 4 as is illustrated by the Figures. The notches 8 can be indentations in the printed circuit card that are not cut through the card, but serve the same purpose of maintaining the electrical connection. Fifth, the fingers 2 may be installed on the printed circuit card 4 and the notches 8 may be located on the pivot arms 9. This could be used to further avoid potential damage to the printed circuit card during installation and removal. Fourth, a single pivot arm 9 with a single finger 2 or a plurality of fingers 2 may be used to secure the printed circuit card 4 to the electrical connector 6 on the main circuit board 16.",
