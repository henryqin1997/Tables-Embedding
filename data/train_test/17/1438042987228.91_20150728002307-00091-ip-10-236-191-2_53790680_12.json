McGahee capped the 12-play march with a three-yard TD.

New England had won 11 straight, with Brady going 8-0., 48803=The unforeseen trouncing continued, as consecutive Brady interceptions gave the Ravens a short field with which to work. Rice had a one-yard plunge, and Billy Cundiff kicked a 27-yard field goal for a startling 24-0 lead with 1:19 remaining in a forgettable first quarter for New England., 50034=In the third quarter, a Dawan Landry interception of a tipped ball resulted in a 23-yard boot by Cundiff, then Edelman caught a one-yard TD pass to pull New England to within 27-14 with 1:47 to go in the stanza.}",
