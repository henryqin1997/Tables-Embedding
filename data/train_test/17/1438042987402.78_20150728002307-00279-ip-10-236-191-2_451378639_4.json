Sterling felt he saw a number of personas in Stryker, like Brando or Presley and tried to use him to that effect. He felt that Stryker had a natural screen presence (as opposed to acting ability) without ever having trained as an actor. Stryker's raunchy lines were unscripted and came on request but of surprising intensity\u2013so much so that sometimes it needed to be edited down. By the time Stryker Force came around, Stryker had been coming across as very hard nosed so Sterling tried to get as softer Stryker in the last scene... as much as he could perform that way. Stryker and Sterling became close friends and Stryker actually lived with Sterling for a year.
