    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{34505=Miscast as a regular in 2005 when he performed admirably filling in for the Dodgers, Robles returned to a role more suited to his abilities in 2006 - that of Triple-A insurance. It's a role which he's likely to revisit again in 2007 with San Diego. Robles isn't very fast, but he has a decent glove and can play second base, third base and shortstop., 35508=2003, 12196=Age is determined on July 1st of each season. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jump To:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25bc Advanced Stats \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25bc Games By Position, 34160=2008, 34904=2006, 27983=12/12/2007, 25774=Age is determined on July 1st of each season. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jump To:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25b2 Basic Stats \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25b2 Split Stats \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25b2 Games By Position, 29054=11/10/2007, 32033=6/24/2007, 33000=6/22/2007, 30144=9/15/2007, 34014=2015, 27039=4/29/2008, 34453=2007, 31158=8/31/2007, 34956=When Cesar Izturis first got hurt, Robles got off on a tear that kept him in the leadoff spot well beyond his usefulness there. The Dodgers had a ton of players of his cloth that logged significant playing time last year - good complimentary players that tend to get exposed over an extended trial. In previous years, former manager Jim Tracy's MacGyver-like patchwork with role players kept the Dodgers afloat, but in 2005 they had too many injuries for the likes of Robles and Jason Repko to overcome., 34212=Robles will probably fill a utility role with the Padres in 2008. Robles has almost no power and he doesn't steal many bases or hit for an impressive average, so his fantasy value is very low.}",
