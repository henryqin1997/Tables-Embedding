No. 476,546, filed June 5, 1974, entitled Method Of And Apparatus For Computer-Multi-Processor Communication And Operation, now abandoned., 41480=Data received from the processor bus is applied to a data latch or register 71 so that, as soon as the bus coupler has received and loaded the data, the coupler can release the bus from which the data was received under the direction of the signal LODBF from the control circuitry 87. Again, this is in conformity with the usual practice for connecting devices to the Lockheed INFIBUS\u2122 data transfer system, as described in the previously identified Lockheed handbook. The latched data is then provided to the cable 59 through the cable interface 57. The more significant bits in the data are also made available to the address mapping memory 63. The registers constituting the memory 63 have system addresses which are included within the range of those recognized by the address recognizer 61. When the address recognizer recognizes one of the addresses corresponding to the memory 63, the binary data made available from the data stream on the bus is loaded into the corresponding memory register, i.e. when enabled by the control signal designated RITMAP. Thus, the address mapping memory 63 can be loaded with data representing selected system memory addresses under program control. The entire collection of data and address signals are also applied to parity logic circuitry indicated generally at 77. This parity logic may be generally of the type described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,035,766 issued July 12, 1977 to William B. Barker and entitled Error-Checking Scheme. Assuming that the data includes one or more parity bits, the parity logic independently calculates the parity bit and compares the calculated parity bit with the transmitted parity bit and transmits a parity okay (POK) signal indicating that the parity bit is correct, if that is the case, this signal being provided to the control circuitry 75. If the parity is not correct, the control circuitry generates the signal designated QUIT, which signal may be generated under certain other failure conditions also consistent with the standard interfacing practices of the Lockheed INFIBUS\u2122 system., 51090=In that this interconnection or switching system is modular and distributed, it is also quite flexible. There is no distinct impediment to adding or subtracting another processor bus, for example, or even another memory bus or communications bus. While the number of bus couplers tends to increase geometrically and there is thus some tradeoff involved in selecting the numbers of processor buses or memory buses and communication buses, there is no abrupt limit or sudden transition in the complexity or effectiveness of the system. Thus, a very high degree of flexibility or expandability is obtainable. An example of a configuration which has evolved using Lockheed components incorporates seven processor buses supporting thirteen processor units, each with an associated 4K local memory. Two system memory buses were used, each bus supporting two 8K memory units. Two expanded communications buses were utilized. This prototype machine was developed by Bolt, Beranek and Newman Inc. for the Advanced Research Projects Agency under Contract Nos. FO8606-75-C-0032 and FO8606-73-C-0027, ARPA Order No. 2351. Many details of the construction of this particular system using Lockheed subsystems are described in Reports Nos. 2930 and 2999 under these contracts. As such detailed information goes beyond the subject of the actual invention and would not be useful in designing a system in accordance with the present invention utilizing other makes of mini-computers, such information is not incorporated in the present specification except by reference to these documents which are of record., 70307=As will be understood by those skilled in the art, programming of a new computer system as described herein involves a developmental process extending over an appreciable length of time even though the hardware development may have essentially come to rest and the programming possibilities are manifest. At the time the present specification was being prepared, programming for the thirteen processor prototype machine described earlier herein had progressed to a substantial extent and two assemblers had been written, one adapted for running on a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-1 computer and one adapted for running on a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10 computer. These assemblers and their usage are described in Report No. 2931 under the Advanced Research Projects Agency Contracts identified previously. Again, this detailed information is tied strongly to the particular prototype construction utilizing Lockheed SUE\u2122 computers and is not general to the present invention. Accordingly, this information is incorporated by reference only.}",

In view of the foregoing, it may be seen that several objects of the present invention are achieved and other advantageous results have been attained. As is brought out in the three ARPA reports referred to in the foregoing specification, the function for which the first multiprocessor prototype was designed was that of an IMP terminal in the ARPA communications network which links a variety of large computer centers spread across the country.
