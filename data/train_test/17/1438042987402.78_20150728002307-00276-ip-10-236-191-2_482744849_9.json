Note that the concentration of the 17\u03b2-estradiol is about 200 times the highest level recorded in the effluent of sewage treatment plants. Furthermore, the background counts of the distilled water (i.e., control sample) used are 22 dpm. The counts of the influent water containing the estradiol are measured as 1700 dpm. One ml samples are taken every liter of throughput. Fifteen ml of Ultra Gold High Flash point scintillation cocktail (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, Conn.) are added to each sample and counted using a Packard Tri Carb 2500 TR liquid Scintillation analyzer (Packard Instrument, Meriden, Conn.). The counts of the effluent water (consistently in all samples) were not significantly different than those of the control samples. Therefore, it is concluded that the filter completely removes the 17\u03b2-estradiol., 31453=Water may contain many different kinds of contaminants including, for example, harmful chemicals. In a variety of circumstances, these contaminants should be removed before the water can be used, for example before the water becomes potable. Hormones are one example of a potentially harmful contaminant that are found in drinking water. In particular, estrogens are a class of hormones and part of a group of chemicals called endocrine disrupters. Estrogens, which may come from plant-derived foods, natural excretion of mammalian females or from birth-control pills, can be discharged from sewage treatment plants, and thus be introduced into the main water supply. These estrogens have been shown to have hormone-disrupting effects on males (both human and animal). Furthermore, estrogens have been linked with declining sperm counts in the human male population and with an increased incidence of testicular, breast and prostate cancer. Research shows that sperm count in Europe fell by 3.1 million per milliliter per year from 1971 to 1990. Testicular cancer rose in England by 55% between 1979 and 1991 with 1,337 cases in 1991. Diagnosed cases of prostate cancer rose in England by 40% over the same period. See the web site for Friends of the Earth (FOE), at http://www.foe. co.uk/fund/welcome/about_foe.html. FOE is in the process of working with companies that currently discharge estrogens into their effluent streams to investigate ways of removing estrogen-type substances from those effluent streams. See Id. For a general discussion of the potential negative health effects resulting from the release of hormones into water sources, see Ridgeway, T. J. and Wiseman, H., \u201cRemoval of oestrogen and oestrogen mimics from the environment\u201d, Biochemical Society Transaction (666th Meeting of the Biochemical Society in Sheffield, England), Vol. 24(4), p 675-680 (November 1998)., 30891=This application claims priority under Title 35, United States Code 119(e) from Provisional Applications Ser. No. 60/172,488, filed Dec. 17, 1999., 50582=Ten liters of distilled water containing 100 nM 17\u03b2-estradiol (non-radioactive from Sigma Inc., Milwaukee, Wis.; Catalog # E8875 & Lot # 77H0666) and 10 \u03bcCi (\u02dc20,000,000 disintegration per minute (dpm)) of tritiated 17\u03b2-estradiol (radioactive from Life Science Products, Inc., Boston, Mass.; Catalog # NET317 & Lot # 3329349) are passed through the test filter at a flow rate of 1 liter per minute. The background counts, C, using distilled water are determined to serve as a control. The counts of the influent water containing the labeled estradiol are measured, the control counts C are subtracted and the difference is reported as X dpm. One ml samples of effluent are taken every liter of throughput. Fifteen ml of Ultra Gold High Flash point scintillation cocktail (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, Conn.) is added to each effluent sample and the samples are counted using a Packard Tri Carb 2500 TR liquid Scintillation analyzer (Packard Instrument). The counts of the effluent samples are measured, the control counts C are subtracted and the difference is reported as Yv dpm, where v is the volume, in liters, of water that has flowed at the time of sampling. The percentage removal of hormone for each sample is calculated as [(X\u2212Yv)/X]\ufffd100., 51951=ACF is packed for use as a filter media utilizing stainless steel cylindrical holders available from Robert James Sales, Inc. (Cincinnati, Ohio) as part # PR1216. These holders have an internal diameter of 5 cm. The stainless steel holders are cleaned with dish washing detergent (e.g., Dawn\ufffd), bleach (e.g., Clorox\ufffd) and diluted with tap water (e.g., 5:1000 dilution). The holders are rinsed with warm tap water, and then rinsed again with isopropyl alcohol. The holders are air dried for 3 hours and then assembled and packed according to the following procedure., 37822=Activated carbon fibers can be characterized by their length, diameter, porosity, specific surface area, and elemental composition. Length is meant to describe the distance from end to end of a fiber. The diameter refers to the mean diameter of a fiber. Porosity is characterized by the mean pore size of the fiber. Specific surface area is a measure of the fiber surface, including the area within the pores, per unit of mass of fiber. For the present invention, activated carbon fibers will preferably have: specific surface areas in a range of from about 100 to about 4000 m2/g, more preferably from about 500 to about 3000 m2/g, still more preferably about 1200 to about 2000 m2/g; diameters in a range of from about 5 to about 50 \u03bcm, more preferably about 10 to about 25 \u03bcm, still more preferably about 15 to about 20 \u03bcm; pore sizes from about 2.5 \u212b to about 300 nm, more preferably from about 5 \u212b to about 200 nm, still more preferably from about 10 \u212b to about 100 nm, and fiber lengths from about 10 \u03bcm to continuous, more preferably from about 200 \u03bcm to about 10 mm, still more preferably from about 1 mm to about 6 mm. Preferred ACFs will have an aspect ratio of at least about 5 and preferably from about 10 to about 2000, more preferably from about 10 to about 500. The carbon fibers can be solid or hollow. Activated carbon fibers have a narrow, sub-micron range of surface features not found in other activated carbon forms such as granules, pellets, or other irregular shapes impregnated with carbon.}",
