This scene could also happen after a time skip in the story. I'm also okay with those.",

Other than MC, I really felt intimidated when MC's father in Vinland Saga take action. He IS the definition of badass...",

After that, the fun keeps going and going. But yeah, it has one of the best/funniest MC intro in manga history"
