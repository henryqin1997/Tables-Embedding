            "The campus counts with Campus Police and they are spread around the campus in case anything happens.",
            "You will be able to find different clubs opportunities like: Chess Club Music Club Art Club Leaders Workshop International Workshop etc...",
            "Since the campus is located near by the border with Mexico the University has a lot of fun traditions such as ''Mr. Amigo'' where an actress, actor or singer from Mexico, visits the bridge which connects the USA with Mexico and have a little carnival. There's also a lot of different international activities in campus.",
            "The campus offers a Student Union building that is a recreational place where you can find pool tables and a good environment to socialize with other students. It also has a REK that is the Gym where you have access by showing your student ID, and of course all the campus has free Wi-Fi. There's also a pool at the REK so there's a lot of activities to do to never get bored or just wait between breaks.",
            "There's a cafeteria in campus and multiple fast food restaurants around it, such like mcdonalds, pizza hut, wing stop, etc...",
            "I've never had a dorm in the campus, but I've heard they are really comfortable and accessible.",
            "Just like every school the university has professors who are easy and other who are hard, in my own experience I've had both, obviously the easier ones you can find them for your basic classes like Composition, College Algebra, History, etc... But once you start with the classes that are designed for your major you will be matched with harder professors. This doesn't mean they are bad teachers, they're nothing but strict with what they want you to do or work on.",
            "If you are going to get enrolled in The University of Texas at Brownsville don't forget what you're going to college for and do your work. Never miss class and try to keep going with your bachelors program so you don't get behind.",
            "The University of Texas at Brownsville is a really good option if you're planning on moving on and try to get your bachelors degree. You can take your own pace and earn your career at your own rhythm, no pressure nor deadlines."

For example, Charro Days is a very fun and exciting festival we celebrate at the end of February each year. Students are actually out of school for a couple of days due to this holiday. We have parades, small concerts, carnivals, and many more stuff. This area is highly influenced by the Mexican culture since we are only five minutes away from Mexico., 134920=Yes, students would be curious as to how and why these practices take place. Also, we get to have three mini carnivals, two circuses, and quite a few parades in town. Parades are around mid February and the other parade in December., 272323=The University of Texas at Brownsville, has a very important place in my life, it means the opportunity for a better tomorrow. Nowadays,it is extremely important to have a college degree or technical certification, in order to find a well paid job. I would describe my life in two phases, before and after UTB, my life is better unfortunatelly, I didn't had the money to attend last semester Spring 2013, but hopefully I can attend this Fall 2013., 338562=There are tons of activites and charity organizations on campus! We have outdoor movie nights with free munchies, parties at the doorm pool, and something us ocelots like to call Orange Crush. It is a party the first week of school with games, free food, music, and many other things. Not to mention, we have the 2013 NAIA Volleyball Champions!, 203430=I personally don't live at the dorms, but they used to be an amazing apartment complex that I used to constantly be at, and it was built in 2011., 399742=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students I would advise prospective students to just enjoy the time they have on campus. UTB is very relaxed and everyone gets along with everyone else here. It's not unpleasant. Bang for the buck Considering that tuition isn't all that expensive in comparison to other colleges in Texas, it saddens me to say that yes. You do get your money's worth! Am enjoying being here This campus isn't all too exciting as far as student life goes. There aren't too many organizations to join and the ones that ARE on campus, aren't very exciting. The dorms aren't very appealing and there really isn't much around campus except for a downtown area. Am learning a lot Despite what many people say about the teachers at this University, I truly believe that I have received a quality education here thus far :) Login to rate or flag the reviews Liz from Brownsville, TX 07/22/2011 Reviewer is A current student here. 4 out of 5 people found this",
