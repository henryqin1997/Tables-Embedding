If you are between sizes or need assistance selecting the proper size, please contact Customer Service Designer The oldest continuously operated shoe company in the United States, stepping into a pair of Frye boots is like stepping into history. The company was founded in 1863 and run for 50 years by John A. Frye, a well-to-do shoemaker from England. Frye boots have traveled with soldiers from America's Civil War through World War II, and in the 1960s the Campus Boot, from its 1860 original, was reintroduced and soon rose to high demand. Today, Frye's boots still hold a place in American culture.
