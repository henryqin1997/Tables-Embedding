    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{34495=FIG. 2 is a block diagram of the adaptive predictive coding apparatus according to the embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 2, an analog television signal supplied to an input line IN is supplied to an analog-to-digital converter (to be referred to as an A/D converter) 11. The analog signal is converted by the A/D converter 11 to a digital signal. The picture elements indicated by the digitl television signal are respectively assigned by a scan converter 12 to a plurality of blocks obtained by dividing up one frame, such that that each block comprises a plurality of picture elements. The scan converter is detailed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,371,895 by Koga filed on Jan. 15, 1981. If the block comprises a one-dimensional block along the horizontal scanning line, the scan converter 12 need not be used. However, if the block comprises a two-dimensional block which extends along both horizontal and vertical scanning lines, the scan converter 12 cannot be omitted. In this embodiment, the two-dimensional block is employed. The television signal which is scanned and converted (to be referred to as a picture signal hereinafter) is supplied to a delay circuit 13 and a motion vector output circuit (optimum prediction function output circuit) 14 through a signal line 1201. The motion vector output circuit 14 receives the picture signal (to be coded) supplied from the signal line 1201 and also an about one-frame delayed picture signal supplied from a frame memory 15 thereto through a signal line 1501. The motion vector output circuit 14 then detects a motion vector indicating the optimum prediction function for each block based on these input signals. The operation of the motion vector output circuit 14 will be described in detail later. The detected motion vector signal is then supplied to a code compressor 20 and a variable delay circuit 16 through a signal line 1401. The variable delay circuit 16 is also detailed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,371,895. The variable delay circuit 16 produces a prediction signal in accordance with the motion vector signal supplied through the signal line 1401 and the picture signal from the frame memory 15 supplied through the signal line 1501. The prediction signal is then supplied to a subtractor 17 and an adder 18. The delay circuit 13 delays the picture signal appearing on the signal line 1201 by a period required for detecting the motion vector signal in the motion vector output circuit 14 and generating the prediction signal. The subtractor 17 subtracts the prediction signal from the output signal from the delay circuit 13 and produces a prediction error signal corresponding to a difference between the prediction signal and the delayed signal. The prediction error signal is quantized by a quantizer 19 which has a plurality of quantization characteristics, so that the level of the digitized prediction error signal is appropriately limited. The quantizer 19 comprises a read-only memory (ROM). The selection of the quantization characteristic is performed in accordance with a selection signal supplied to the quantizer 19 through a signal line 1019. The output signal from the quantizer 19 is supplied to a gate 21. The gate 21 performs subsample coding of a picture element or subline coding of a scanning line along the horizontal or vertical scanning direction in response to a gate signal supplied thereto through a signal line 1021. An output signal from the gate 21 is supplied to the adder 18 and the code compressor 20. The adder 18 adds the quantized prediction error signal and the output signal (prediction signal) from the variable delay circuit 16 and produces a local decoding signal., 39208=Codes of the coding control mode which indicate an operating state of the selection signal supplied through the line 1019 and the gate signal supplied through the line 1021 and of the horizontal and vertical sync signals are added by the code compressor 20. The picture signal compressed by the code compressor 20 is supplied to a buffer memory 100. The buffer memory 100 serves to match an input rate of the picture signals irregularly generated from the code compressor 20 with a transmission rate of the picture signal onto the transmission line. The matched output signal from the buffer memory 100 is transmitted to the transmission line or a recording medium through an output line OUT. The selection of subsample, subline, and quantization characteristic is performed in accordance with the amount of data stored in the buffer memory 100 (i.e., occupancy of the buffer memory 100). The coding control circuit 101 continually supervises the occupancy of the buffer memory 100. The occupancy is computed by a difference between counts of the read and write counters. A signal representative of the occupancy is fed via line 1001 to the coding control circuit 101. The selection signal and the gate signal are generated to control coding in accordance with the relationship between a predetermined occupancy of the buffer memory and the coding control mode., 40589=The operation of the motion vector output circuit 14 will be described in detail with reference to FIG. 3. The picture signal from the signal line 1201 and the about one-frame delayed picture signal from the signal line 1501 are supplied to a prediction error data amount generator 141. The prediction error data amount generator (i.e., second evaluating means) 141 receives various prediction function data (to be simply referred to as the prediction function hereinafter) supplied from a sequencer 142 through a signal line 1421. The sequencer comprised of a counter and a ROM, for example, produces vector outputs in predetermined sequence. The prediction error data amount generator 141 generates the amount of prediction error data for the block which corresponds to the given prediction function in response to the selection signal and the gate signal. The selection signal and the gate signal are supplied to the prediction error data amount generator 141 through the lines 1019 and 1021, respectively. The prediction error data amount signal is then supplied to an adder 143 through a signal line 1411. The prediction error data amount generator 141 will be described in detail later. The prediction function produced from the sequencer 142 is also supplied to a selector 144 and a vector code length generator (first evaluating means) 145 as well as to the prediction error data amount generator 141. The vector code length generator 145 produces predetermined code length data to the adder 143 so as to express the supplied prediction function., 52655=In case of determining the motion vector in the adaptive predictive coding apparatus, if the prediction function is produced in one direction from the sequencer 142 shown in FIG. 3, it is assumed that all the prediction functions are used. However, another method can also be utilized. In particular, since similar motion vectors correspond to the optimum prediction function between two adjacent blocks, an output signal from the vector output register 146 may be supplied through the signal line 1401 and at the same time to the sequencer 142. The sequencer 142 then produces as a prediction function a signal which does not greatly differ from the motion vector, thereby decreasing the number of times of computation. Furthermore, still another method which resembles the above may be proposed. An output signal from the selector 144 may be supplied to the sequencer 142, and the sequencer 142 can then determine the prediction function to be produced in accordance with the output signal from the selector 144., 43819=The adder 143 adds the code length data representative of a prediction function and the data amount of prediction error data of a block at the time when this prediction function is used. Sum data is then supplied from the adder 143 to the selector 144. The selector 144 comprises a register and a comparator. The selector 144 compares the present sum data with preceding sum data. If the present sum data is determined by the selector 144 to be minimum, the selector 144 holds as the present optimum prediction function (motion vector) the prediction function supplied through the signal line 1421. However, if the present sum is not determined to be minimum, the preceding sum data is held as the present optimum prediction function which is contantly supplied to a vector output register 146. The vector output register 146 supplies the present optimum prediction function (i.e. motion vector) onto the signal line 1401 in accordance with a timing signal which is supplied from the sequencer 142 through the signal line 1422 at the termination of a block. The motion vector thus determined is the output signal from the motion vector output circuit 14., 47148=The relationship between the difference and the code length mainly depends on the quantization characteristics for the difference (i.e., on the number of quantization levels). Therefore, when a plurality of quantization characteristics having different quantization levels are provided and when a set of code lengths is predetermined corresponding to each characteristic, and a proper set of code lengths is selected in accordance with the quantization characteristic selected by the quantizer 19, the amount of code length data can always be converted to a proper total code length. This selection can be performed by the selection signal which is used to select a proper quantization characteristic and which is supplied through the signal line 1019., 44993=The prediction error data amount generator 141 will be described in detail with reference to FIG. 4. The picture signal scanned and converted by the scan converter 12 is supplied to a parallel output circuit 41 through the line 1201. The parallel output circuit 41 simultaneously produces picture element data included in one block. Assume that a given block comprises 8 picture elements (= 4 picture elements \ufffd2 lines) before conversion is peformed, as shown in FIG. 5. In this condition, picture elements a, b, c, d, e, f, g and h are simultaneously supplied to subtractors 61 to 68 through signal lines 4101 to 4108, respectively. Eight variable delay circuits 51 to 58 produce outputs in response to the prediction function corresponding to all the picture elements in the given block, respectively, in accordance with the prediction function supplied through the signal line 1421. Assume that this prediction function is defined as V as shown in FIG. 6. The picture elements in this block are offset from those (indicated by the hatched portion) of the interframe prediction signal by one picture element to the right and three picture elements upward. The prediction signals are subject to quantization noises and expressed as a, b, c, d, e, f, g and h in accordance with the prediction function V. When the variable delay circuits 51 to 54 and 55 to 58 produce the prediction signals corresponding to the picture elements from the upper left corner to the upper right corner and from the lower left corner to the lower right corner, respectively, they produce prediction signals a to d and e to h with respect to the prediction function V, respectively. The about one-frame delayed picture signal from the frame memory 15 through the signal line 1501 and the prediction function supplied from the sequencer 142 through the line 1421 are commonly supplied to the variable delay circuits 51 to 58. The subtractors perform subtractions (a-a) to (h-h). The obtained difference signals are then supplied to code length generators 71 to 78, respectively. The difference signals are then converted to code length signals, respectively., 31597=As a system for detecting the displacement (i.e., an optimum prediction system), a motion-compensated interframe coding system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,307,420 by Ninomiya et al. filed on June 2, 1980. According to this system, prediction errors obtained by various prediction functions respectively corresponding to various shift vectors are compared on a block by block basis. A shift vector corresponding to a given prediction function indicating a minimum prediction error is regarded as a motion vector (optimum prediction function). If motion compensation or correction is applied to the motion of a picture, the total amount of data required for coding is decreased or compressed to be half of that when the interframe coding system is applied., 32703=The ratio of code data which is required to express the motion vector (i.e., motion vector data) to the total transmission data greatly varies in accordance with the transmission rate of a transmission line. The motion vector data ratio is very small with respect to the total transmission data when the transmission rate is very high and several bits can be assigned to each picture element. However, when the transmission rate is low, 50%, for example, of the total transmission data may be motion vector data. Hirano et al. reported in \"Study on Block Size in Motion-Compensated Interframe Coding\", Lecture No. 697 of National Meeting of the Field of the Institute of Electronics and Communications Engineers of Japan, 1980, that the amount of motion vector data may be measured for individual picture elements. According to this report, the entropy of the motion vector which is used as a criterion for the motion vector data is measured to be 0.1 bit/pixel when a block having a plurality of picture elements or pixels comprises a size of 4 lines \ufffd8 pixels. This value is obtained when the sampling frequency is 8 MHz, so that the motion vector data occurs at a rate of 0.8 Mbit/sec. For example, if the television signal is transmitted at a transmission rate of 1.5 Mbits/sec, more than 50% of the total transmission data comprises the motion vector data., 38191=The local decoding signal is supplied to an interpolator 22. The interpolator 22 interpolates the picture element or scanning line when subsample or subline coding is specified by a signal on the line 1021. Otherwise, the interpolator 22 does not perform interpolation. An output signal from the interpolator 22 is supplied to the frame memory 15 which then delays the signal by about one frame. When the motion vector is zero, the sum of delay amounts of the frame memory 15 and the variable delay circuit 16 is exactly equal to one frame. The delay by the frame memory 15 is thus slightly smaller than one frame. As described above, the about one-frame delayed signal is supplied to the motion vector output circuit 14 and the variable delay circuit 16. The code compressor 20 comprises, for example, a variable length encoder. The code compressor 20 effectively compresses and encodes the quantized prediction error signal and the motion vector signal in accordance with variable length coding., 47920=The addition of the code length data is performed by an adder 80. The output code length data are not always added to each other. For example, if such thin-out as subsample or subline coding is performed by a switching circuit 21, the amount of the sum data of all the picture elements in the block apparently differs from the actual amount of the sum data of picture elements. This subsample or subline coding is performed in response to the gate signal supplied through the signal line 1021. The adder 80 determines whether or not all of the output signals from the code length generators 71 to 78 are added using the gate signal. Therefore, even if subsample or subline coding is performed, the proper data amount can be computed. The sum data corresponds to the amount of prediction error data per block and is supplied to the adder 143 through the signal line 1411.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In summary, the prediction function data and the predictive error data corresponding to this prediction function data are used to detect the motion vector (i.e., optimum prediction function) in the motion-compensated interframe prediction coding apparatus. The coding efficiency is greatly improved, thus providing a great advantage in a variety of practical applications. In the above embodiment, the code length data which indicates the prediction function and the code length data which indicates the prediction error data corresponding to this prediction function are added with respect to the picture elements in the block so as to detect the motion vector. However, the code lengths need not be precise but may be determined by an approximation. These modifications can be readily performed with a slight change in the circuit arrangement shown in FIG. 3. Predictive coding is performed for the motion vector data supplied through the line 1401; the process of obtaining this motion vector data does not limit the arrangement of the adaptive predictive coding apparatus of the present invention. Therefore, the arrangement of the apparatus need not be modified. In case of determining the motion vector in the adaptive predictive coding apparatus, if the prediction function is produced in one direction from the sequencer 142 shown in FIG. 3, it is assumed that all the prediction functions are used. However, another method can also be utilized. In particular, since similar motion vectors correspond to the optimum",
