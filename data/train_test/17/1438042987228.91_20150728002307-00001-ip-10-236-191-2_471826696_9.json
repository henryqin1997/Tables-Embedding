Accordingly, the invention is not limited except by the appended claims. The feeding tube (90) is inserted into a patient's nose, down the esophagus and into the stomach. The detection apparatus (80) described in Example 1 above and illustrated in FIG. 3, is used to sense the magnet's static magnetic field strength (91a) at two different distances (9lb) and (91c) while immersed in the earth's ambient magnetic field (100). As the detection apparatus (80) is moved about the patient's body, greater and lesser magnetic field gradients are indicated. The feeding tube (90) is located by moving the detection apparatus until the greatest magnitude is indicated by detection apparatus (80). Referring to FIG. 4, a feeding tube (90), with a permanent magnet (91) located in its tip, includes an elongated, tubular, main portion with a sealed magnet chamber at its distal end, and an adapter at its proximal end to allow connection to a source of feeding formula. Side apertures at the distal end, above the magnet chamber, extend from the inner tube lumen to the exterior of the tube allowing the feeding formula to reach the patient's stomach. The sealed magnet chamber contains a cylindrical, rare earth, permanent magnet",
