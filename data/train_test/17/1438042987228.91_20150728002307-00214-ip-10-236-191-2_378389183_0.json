This was called \u2018SuperHero\u2019 and was their way of celebrating trick-or-treat. A great amount of food was collected and the Food Pantry wants them to know how much it was appreciated., 23922=Motor vehicle crashes remain the leading cause of death among adolescents and young adults in the U.S. Here in Kentucky, statistics from the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet show that drivers between the ages of 15 and 20 were involved in more than 26,000 collisions in 2008, resulting in 141 fatalities. Seventy-percent of those killed were teenagers. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, 16-year-old drivers are more than twice as likely to be involved in fatal crashes as older drivers., 45093=Copyright \u00a9 2015, 18060=Next Wednesday, Nov. 11, our nation will recognize the 90th anniversary of what was known for years as Armistice Day but what we now call Veterans Day., 18231=President Woodrow Wilson chose that date because, in 1918, it marked the formal end of World War I, the first major global conflict that, unfortunately, did not live up to one of its popular nicknames: The War to End All Wars.}",
