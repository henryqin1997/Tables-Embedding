Because it accumulates data over time to obtain sufficient levels of reliability for small geographic areas, the Census Bureau must minimize content changes. Consistency must be maintained throughout all ACS data collection operations, including HUs and GQ facilities. Introducing changes could affect data quality and result in only partial releases of data for a given year if a question changes significantly, or has not been asked for long enough to accumulate 3 or 5 years worth of data.
