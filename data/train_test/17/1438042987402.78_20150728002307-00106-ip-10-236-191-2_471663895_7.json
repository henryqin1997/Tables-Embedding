Retinoids are a group of natural and synthetic vitamin A analogues whose principal effects on target cells are growth inhibition and induction of differentiation. Retinoids have also been shown to exert immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory functions, however the mechanism of these functions are not well understood. K. Mehta et al. (1994) \"Inhibition by all-trans-retinoic acid of tumor necrosis factor and nitric oxide production by peritoneal macrophages,\" J. Leuko. Biol., Vol. 44, pp. 336-342. It is generally believed, however, that nucleosolic binding proteins, such as nuclear retinoic acid (RA and RX) receptors, are involved in retinoid action. Willhite et al. (1992) \"Structure-Affinity Relationships of retinoids with Embryonic Cellular retinoic acid-binding protein,\" Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol., Vol. 1123, pp. 144-153; EP 0 552 612 A2, published Jul. 28, 1993., 38464=Other representative retinoids contemplated for use in the invention are disclosed in EP 0 11 325 B1, published Jun. 20, 1984; EP 0 263 493 A2, published Oct. 7, 1986; EP 0 274 104 A2, published Jul. 13, 1988; EP 0 303 915 B1, published Feb. 22, 1989; EP 0 100 839 B1, published Feb. 22, 1984; EP 0 263 492 A1, published Apr. 13, 1988; EP 0439 042 A1, published Jul. 31, 1991; EP 0 552 624 A1, published Jul. 28, 1993; EP 0568 898 A1, published Nov. 10, 1993; U.K. patent application GB 2 190 378 A, published Nov. 18, 1987; U.S. Pat.

One method involves the use of competitive nuclear retinoic acid (RA and RX) receptor binding assays for identifying compounds which bind directly to the receptors. For instance, J. J. Repa et al. ((1993) \"All-trans-retinol is a ligand for the retinoic acid receptors,\" Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol. 90, pp. 7293-7297) discloses a competitive RA receptor binding assay based on human neuroblastoma cell nuclear extracts. H. Torma et al. ((1994) \"Biologic activities of retinoic acid and 3,4-dehydroretinoic acid in human keratinoacytes are similar and correlate with receptor affinities and transactivation properties,\" J. Invest. Dermatology, Vol. 102, pp. 49-54) discloses assays for measuring binding affinities for the nuclear retinoic acid receptors and for measuring transcriptional activation induction. M. F. Boehm et al. ((1994) \"Synthesis of high specific activity [3 H]-9-cis-retinoic acid and its application for identifying retinoids with unusual binding properties,\" J. Med. Chem., Vol. 37, pp. 408-414) discloses a ligand-binding assay and a receptor/reporter cotransfection assay for monitor regulation of gene expression. EP 0 552 612 A2, published Jul. 28, 1993, describes ligand-binding trapping assays based on incubation of radiolabeled compounds with transfected COS-1 cells which express RA and RX receptors., 42063=Retinoids also increase fibrinolytic enzyme activity which in turn reduces fibrin deposition which serves as a scaffold for adhesion formation. For instance, retinoids increased PMA-induced plasminogen activator production as well as the expression of urokinase receptors. W. A. Schuster et al. (1993) \"Retinoic acid potentiates phorbol ester-mediated induction of urokinase and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 in human myeloid leukemic cell lines,\" Endocrinology, Vol. 133, pp. 1724-30; I. Immonen et al. (1993) \"Retinoids increase urokinase-type plasminogen activator production by human retinal pigment epithelial cells in culture,\" Invest. Ophthal.& Visual Sci., Vol. 34, pp. 2062-67; J. van Giezen et al. (1993) \"Retinoic acid enhances fibrinolytic activity in vivo by enhancing tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) activity and inhibits venous thrombosis,\" Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Vol. 69, pp. 381-6; R. D. Medh et al. (1992) \"Stimulation of tissue plasminogen activator production by retinoic acid: synergistic effect on protein kinase C-mediated activation,\" Blood, Vol. 40, pp. 981-7.A. M. Van Bennekum et al. (1993) \"Modulation of tissue type plasminogen activator by retinoids in rat plasma and tissues,\" Am. J. of Physiology, Vol. 363, R931., 51986=One particularly suitable formulation to achieve the desired near zero-order release of retinoids comprise injectable microcapsules or microspheres prepared from a biodegradable polymer, such as poly(dl-lactide), poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide), poly-caprolactone, polyglycolide, polylactic acid-co-glycolide, poly(hydroxybutyric acid), a polyortho-ester or a polyacetal. Encapsulation of retinoic acid in microspheres of biodegradable polymers has already been reported. For instance, poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) were found to be useful in sustained release of the drug in rabbit models of proliferative vitreoretinopathy. G. G. Giordano et al. (1993) \"Sustained Delivery of Retinoic Acid from Microspheres of Biodegradable Polymer in PVR,\" Investig. Ophthal. Vis. Sci., Vol. 34, pp. 2743-2751., 41390=While the present invention is not bound to any particular theory, it is believed that retinoids (particularly retinoic acid) may inhibit adhesion formation through a variety of mechanisms. For example, retinoids reduces the formation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a proinflammatory cytokine that could conceivably increase adhesion formation. K. Mehta et al. (1994). Retinoids also reduced IL-1-induced IL-6 production. IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine that may contribute to adhesion formation. Zitnik et al. (1994) \"Retinoic Acid Inhibition of IL-1 Induced IL-6 Production by Human Lung Fibroblasts,\" J. Immun., Vol. 152, pp. 1419-1427., 43404=Retinoids also modulate the production of thrombomodulin, tissue factor and procoagulant activity in such a way as to increase fibrinolytic activity. Increased fibrinolytic activity, as mentioned above, may inhibit adhesion formation. M. Conese et al. (1991) \"Inhibitory effect of retinoids on the generation of procoagulant activity by blood mononuclear phagocytes,\" Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Vol. 66, pp. 662-5; S. Horie et al. (1993) \"Retinoic acid stimulates expression of thrombomodulin, a cell surface anticoagulant glycoprotein, on human endothelial cells,\" Biochem. J., Vol. 281, pp. 149-154; H. Ishii et al. (1992) \"Retinoid acid counteracts both the downregulation of thrombomodulin and the induction of tissue factor in human endothelial cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor,\" Blood, Vol. 80, pp. 2556-62., 60199=Pursuant to yet another approach, at least one retinoid is administered in combination with an absorbable mechanical barrier which alone reduces adhesion formation. As would be readily apparent to one working in the field, at least one retinoid may be covalently or non-covalently (e.g., ionically) bound to such a barrier, or it may simply be dispersed therein. A particularly suitable mechanical barrier for use in this particular embodiment of the invention comprises oxidized regenerated cellulose; one such absorbable barrier is available under the designation INTERCEED(TC7) from Johnson and Johnson Medical, Inc., New Brunswick, N.J. [INTERCEED(TC7) Adhesion Barrier Study Group, \"Prevention of postsurgical adhesions by INTERCEED(TC7), an absorbable adhesion barrier: a prospective, randomized multicenter clinical study,\" Fertility and Sterility, Vol. 51, p. 933 (1989)]. The use of a mechanical barrier as a carrier to deliver heparin to traumatized surfaces is disclosed in Diamond, M. P. et al., \"Synergistic effects of INTERCEED(TC7) and heparin in reducing adhesion formation in the rabbit uterine horn model,\" Fertility and Sterility, Vol. 55, p. 389 (1991 ) and Diamond, M. P. et al., \"Adhesion reformation: reduction by the use of INTERCEED(TC7) plus heparin,\" J. Gyn. Surg., Vol. 7, p. 1 (1991), the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference., 31638=Suitable, but non-limiting, retinoids for use in the invention include the following literature reported compounds: G. Doepner et al. ((1992) \"Effects of novel retinoids on growth and differentiation of a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line,\" Arzneim.-Forsch/Drug Res., Vol. 42, pp. 1036-1040) disclosed retinoic acid derivatives such as all-trans-retinoic acid-\u03b2-D-galactopyranosylester; methyl-(1-O-retinoyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside)uronate; all-trans retinyl-\u03b2-D-glucuronide; methyl-(1-O-retinyl-2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside)uronate;methyl-(1-O-retinyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside)uronate; all-trans-retinoic acid-2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-\u03b2-D-galactopyranosylester; and all-transretinoic acid-2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranosylester.}",
