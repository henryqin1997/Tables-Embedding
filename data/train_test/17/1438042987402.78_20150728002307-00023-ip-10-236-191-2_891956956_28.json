Oriental Theater, Miramar Theater for good music and movies., 229674=Looking for fun things to do in Milwaukee is hardly ever an issue. The Miramar on Oakland ave is a great venue for bands and electronic music Wednesday - Saturday of most every week (the only downside about the venue being a small cover charge). For those who are 21 or older, there are many bars and clubs surrounding the area to have fun, dance, and meet new and interesting people. During the warmer months bike riding, rollerblading, running, or playing volleyball is quite popular around the beaches on Lincoln Memorial Drive., 20213=Apply for as many scholarships as possible for school. Whether it is $100, or $1000, every little bit helps. Also, be sure to get your information and everything sent in by the deadlines so that you are not feeling like you are behind everyone else., 40126=I would suggest that anyone looking to pursue a dance degree should take dance classes from a local studio for a few years before attending the required audition. It was very obvious that the professors conducting the audition were looking for prospective students with previous dance training. Scholarships were awarded at the first three auditions held in October, February, and April. The last audition was held in June and students were still admitted to the program but scholarship money had already been used up., 761151=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 348388=Every October there is a Zombie Apocalypse where there are students dressed up as zombies, and you must cross the campus without being bitten., 163393=We have so many clubs and activities that I wouldn't even be able to count! If you can think of something we most likely have it! I, on the other hand, found an organization that we did not have, Autism Speaks. Once I found out we did not have an organization here, I started looking into starting it. I am now currently getting the chapter started for the Fall 2012 semester!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students This college is great if you are unsure of what you want to major in. They offer an Ed Psych course that runs once a week and it's purpose is to help you select a major. It's great for someone who likes the city and isn't freaked out by crowds of people. It's also decent for commuters. Tips for prospective students -Do not put off orientation until the last minute. It's when you schedule your classes and you do not want to get stuck with the last picks. -Always rent your course books when you have the option. -Don't get caught up in the fun. Professors don't care if you don't do your homework, but it seriously hurts your grade. You need at least a C to pass a class here, so don't slack off. -Show up to class. Seriously, you will be so lost if you don't. This isn't high school where you get the homework the next day. And make sure you show up ON TIME. Some of my professors will count tardies as absences. If you have too many absences, it will knock points off your grades. -Sit in the first few rows of the lecture hall. It sounds dorky, but it helps you pay attention. -Actually pay attention in your lectures. Some of your professors will not be from",
