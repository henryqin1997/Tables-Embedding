            "I would say that the campus safety is quite good. There are officers who patrol the campus often. In fact, Chemeketa hosts safety demonstrations and gives out information and tips for student safety. Recently they had firemen, EMTs, police officers, and the swat team come in and give safety demonstrations.",
            "Chemeketa has MANY different clubs and activities. Many students create their own clubs, as well as join additional clubs that Chemeketa has provided. Every once in awhile, the clubs will get together and have a fair in the central building. They try to interest other students in their clubs, and everyone has a fun time.",
            "There is a short but beautiful forest trail that students enjoy walking along. A little convenience store sits on campus that is fun to peruse. I love to find little-used nooks and crannies on campus to sit and study. There are quite a few of these.",
            "Chemeketa offers great professors for a reasonable price. I have been pleased with the professors I have taken classes from. I have learned much from my time at the college. I believe it's a good idea to get my pre-requisites completed at a community college (which costs less) and then transfer to another college. A wonderful thing about Chemeketa is that they have an excellent transfer program. A student can transfer to many different colleges in Oregon from Chemeketa.",
            "Chemeketa sometimes shows movies. They have a tennis, volleyball, and basketball court, a gym, and a track. Students are free to form clubs of their own and meet in the college. The planetarium has a show every week, and the cultural center will sometimes have guest speakers. There is also a small art gallery that features different respected artists' work.",
            "There is a centrally located and convenient food court in the middle of campus. It has much food to choose from, and serves breakfast and lunch. There are smaller areas to buy food and drinks within other buildings in the campus also. Chemeketa has a way for needy students to get free food.",
            "Chemeketa has no dorms.",
            "Chemeketa has many fun student programs. There are many clubs and energetic, creative outlets for students who want to do more than merely attend classes. There is a planetarium, cultural center, and library (which can order books from almost anywhere if they don't currently have the book you need). There are many programs for students who need jobs; some can even become tutors or help in the writing center. Also, many guest speakers have come to Chemeketa.",
            "Go to the website ratemyprofessor.com to get tips on who are the best teachers at Chemeketa. If you work hard and study, you should be able to do very well! Never hesitate to ask professors questions; they are all extremely willing to answer questions. I believe they rather enjoy sharing their expertise with students. There are many programs at Chemeketa that can help students. They have a job placement program, a writing center (where teachers and other students help students with papers), librarians dedicated to getting students the books and information needed, a computer lab (for students who don't have access to computers), and an open lab room (for students who wish to study for the science classes they are taking). I have found the open lab room to be immensely helpful for my own studying. There are also many classes at Chemeketa to help new or continuing students. Some classes help students search for scholarships and financial aid, some help students figure out what career they might be interested in, and others help students develop what study habits work best for them.",
            "Chemeketa Community College is a great college to get a good education without having to pay a steep price. The teachers I have had are quite good, with one or two exceptions. The teachers are kind, helpful, and have encouraged me with my goals!"

Reviewer has been to campus. 3 out of 3 people found this review useful. 3 of 57 Categories Comments Bang for the buck Chemeketa offers a scholars program which pays for your tuition for your first 2 years if you maintain a GPA of 3.5 and higher. This has made Chemeketa grow more and more popular because of course, everyone wants to save money. Will enjoy being here One thing that separates Chemeketa from a university is the rate of people most of the time being much older than you. So in some classes it may feel like you are the only one your age. But that doesn't mean there aren't people whom you wouldn't get along with. Will learn a lot This school is of course, a community college. Unlike",
