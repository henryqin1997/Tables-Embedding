            "We have a stellar campus security team and Wartburg is located in a pretty safe town as well.",
            "There aren't any fraternities or sororities on campus although we do have some academic based groups on campus.",
            "There is a club for everyone on campus whether it follows your major (Psychology club, academics, or even knitting!) or service type activities. A great way to get involved and work on leadership skills (that also look good on a resume).",
            "If you are spiritual, outgoing, or just looking for a new friendly experience then this college is for you!",
            "We have OUTFLY!!!! This is a day when the student body president and the college president get together and decide to call off classes for the whole day! It happens in fall term but no one knows when it will be. There is always a cool theme and a lot of fun stuff for everyone to do (that they bring on campus as extras. i.e. inflatables, movies, tournaments, picnics)",
            "Overall, I'd say Wartburg has a lot of good resources that make going here worth it- especially if you go into a major department that has a lot going for it.",
            "There are a few bars around campus that have pool and dancing although some are more than a little shady. There is also a movie theater and a bowling alley, not much for shopping though. There are a lot of on-campus activities offered too which is nice because you almost have to drive everywhere!",
            "The dining hall isn't that bad although it does get repetitive. However you can always do a meal transfer or do points and that helps out a lot!",
            "Depending on where you live dorm life can be awesome! However, its also really expensive and they make it really, really hard to live off campus.",
            "Classes are challenging without being too hard.",
            "Try try try for scholarships! Don't forget that you can barter with them for more. Also, if you are looking at agricultural sciences I'd look else ware, this is mostly a pre-med bio department",
            "Wartburg is a good school for those looking for a small town atmosphere. They do have a lot of great programs and classes with a liberal arts feel. On the negative side, it is very expensive to go here and the business office is really not the most helpful."

The President and the Student Body President pick a day out of the fall semester where classes are cancelled for the day. There is a theme picked and at 6:30 in the morning, all the students gather outside near the victory bell to start it off. All day there is food, activities, and fun interaction to be had., 169119=Wartburg College has several nice teachers that love to help students. They also have a great athletic facility that amazes you every time you see. Wartburg college provides a May term that allows you to study abroad where ever you want., 22629=My friends and I plan to visit Wartburg in November. Hopefully we have a insightful trip., 1506=In January 2008, they completed a multimillion dollar project to build the Wartburg-Waverly Wellness Complex (also known as The W). While the facility is state-of-the-art, many of the students don't get to see the more impressive aspects of it (those are reserved for community members and athletes). Other than that, you are really getting what you pay for!, 193720=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 82780=It's basically whatever you'd do in high school except there aren't parents to rein you in, just RAs. My friends and I like to get together to play video games, watch movies, play Catchphrase, or venture off campus to go out to eat or to a movie. Additionally , there are a lot of events on campus including comedians, singers, bands, and other cultural events. One such cultural event is the Culture Show that the international students put on every year showcasing their home countries. It's VERY impressive. They start practicing months in advance. Another fun show every year is the Drag Show that Alliance puts on. They get famous local drag queens and students to perform. It's definitely worth the few dollars you pay to get in! Entertainment ToKnight (ETK) brought Maroon 5 to campus a few years back for their annual Large Event, and last year we had Javier Colon came in April. ETK also sponsors a $1 Movie Knight (we're the Knights if you haven't guessed) the first Wednesday of every month at the local movie theater. It's a late show---usually starts at 11:30pm. That's one of my favorite things to do. I could go on and on about this. There's stuff to do. Trust me., 63408=Every fall term we have Outfly, a day of no classes! We don't find out that it's Outfly until 6:30 in the morning the day of, but it's a wonderful day. There are also several other traditions, especially within organizations, such as the band who has lots of unique traditions. Wartburg also has May Term. We finish second semester in April, and for the month of May we take 1 class. Many students take this opportunity to travel to a variety of different countries- England, France, Spain, China, Japan, Tanzania, and Costa Rica to name a few.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Wartburg College offers a liberal education, which basically means that you learn a lot of different things beyond just your major. For example, I am a Music Education major, but I am in an English class and a Chemistry class. At first I thought that I would not enjoy taking more gen eds than I would have at other schools, but I feel like it is actually a really great thing that will make me more attractive to future employers.

One of the best things about Wartburg is all the community service opportunities so people who like to volunteer and be involved will fit right in. Tips for prospective students",
