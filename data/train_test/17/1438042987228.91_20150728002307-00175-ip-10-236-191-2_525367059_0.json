            "Department of Justice officials may disclose information protected by the Federal Wiretap Act (Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968), Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and section 626 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act to the Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d) in connection with many, but not all, of OIG\u2019s investigations and reviews. Section 6(a)(1) of the Inspector General Act of 1978 does not supersede the limitations on disclosure contained in Title III, Rule 6(e), and section 626. Section 218 of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, also does not supersede the limitations on disclosure contained in Title III, Rule 6(e), and section 626.",
            "The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s proposed policy to prioritize the removal of certain aliens unlawfully present in the United States would be a permissible exercise of DHS\u2019s discretion to enforce the immigration laws. The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s proposed deferred action program for parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents would also be a permissible exercise of DHS\u2019s discretion to enforce the immigration laws. The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s proposed deferred action program for parents of recipients of deferred action under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program would not be a permissible exercise of DHS\u2019s enforcement discretion.",
            "The Assistant to the President and Director of the Office of Political Strategy and Outreach (\u201cOPSO\u201d) is immune from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform\u2019s subpoena to compel him to testify about matters concerning his service to the President in the OPSO.",
            "The competitive bidding requirement of 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 imposes, in addition to procedural rules dictating the process by which bids are awarded, a substantive limitation on state or local bidding requirements that are unrelated to the bidder\u2019s performance of the necessary work. Section 112\u2019s competitive bidding requirement does not preclude any and all state or local bidding or contractual restrictions that have the effect of reducing the pool of potential bidders for reasons unrelated to the performance of the necessary work. Rather, section 112 affords the Federal Highway Administration discretion to assess whether a particular state or local requirement unduly limits competition. Generally, state or local government requirements that eliminate or disadvantage a class of potential responsible bidders to advance objectives unrelated to the efficient use of federal funds or the integrity of the bidding process are likely to unduly impede competition in contravention of the substantive component of section 112\u2019s competitive bidding requirement.",
            "The Millennium Challenge Corporation is not an \u201cagency\u201d for purposes of the open meeting requirements of the Sunshine Act.",
            "Notwithstanding the expiration of the specific authorizations of appropriations for the Work Incentives Planning and Assistance program and the Protection and Advocacy for Beneficiaries of Social Security program, the appropriation for administrative expenses of the Social Security Administration remains available to fund those two grant programs. When an agency has legal authority to administer a program and appropriated funds are available for that purpose, the absence or expiration of an authorization of appropriations does not prevent the agency from expending funds on the program unless such a restriction is imposed by statute.",
            "Under Executive Order 11103, which describes a \u201cfull term of service\u201d as \u201capproximately two years,\u201d the Director of the Peace Corps may not issue certificates of satisfactory service to volunteers in the Peace Corps Response program (\u201cPCRVs\u201d) who serve between three and twelve months. The Director may not issue certificates of satisfactory service to PCRVs under the exception in Executive Order 11103 for those who do not complete a full term \u201cdue to circumstances beyond their control.\u201d",
            "The Federal Employee Compensation Act gives the Department of Labor the authority to control and limit the disclosure of FECA records held by the United States Postal Service, and DOL\u2019s FECA regulations prohibit USPS from disclosing FECA records in a manner inconsistent with DOL\u2019s Privacy Act routine uses. The Labor Department\u2019s regulatory regime for FECA records is consistent with and furthers the purposes of the Privacy Act. Neither the Postal Reorganization Act nor the National Labor Relations Act authorizes USPS to control the disclosure of FECA records.",
            "Executive privilege may properly be asserted in response to a congressional subpoena seeking internal Department of Justice documents generated in the course of the deliberative process concerning the Department\u2019s response to congressional and related media inquiries into Operation Fast and Furious.",
            "Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 13031\u2014a provision of the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990\u2014all covered professionals who learn of suspected child abuse while engaged in enumerated activities and professions on federal land or in federal facilities must report that abuse, regardless of where the suspected victim is cared for or resides. The fact that a patient has viewed child pornography may \u201cgive reason to suspect that a child has suffered an incident of child abuse\u201d under the statute, and a covered professional is not relieved of an obligation to report the possible abuse simply because neither the covered professional nor the patient knows the identity of the child depicted in the pornography."
