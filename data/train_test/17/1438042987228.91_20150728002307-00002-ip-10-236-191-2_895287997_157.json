            "Mizzou is a very safe place. There are blue light phones on almost ever part of campus with an emergency button that immediately alerts MUPD and they are pretty speedy on response.",
            "Greek life is what you make it at Mizzou...either you like it or you don't. There are many different types of fraternities and sororities, ranging from band to minority.",
            "Mizzou has over 1.000 student organizations, it's just up to you to decide which one is best for you, and get involved!",

            "There is a plethora of things that you can do, you just have to get out there and find out what Mizzou has to offer. There is always something going on.",
            "They have amazing food! They offer 3 different dining halls, but they also have other places to eat around campus such as Subway and Baja (a Mexican grill) for when you get tired of dining hall food.

Read this guide before you buy textbooks: http://www.brainofjt.com/2014/01/textbook-trick-save-money.html It could save you thousands of dollars to use the method provided. 2. Many of the courses, especially in the business school, have exams with questions directly from the book rather than lecture. To succeed in those courses you'll need to 3. Get involved with people who actually care about your well-being. As a beginning college student, you'll run into a lot of college students who want you do talk and act like them. Usually that involves compromising your morals. Instead, places such as the BSU or Baptist Student Union will love to have you come in and be a part of everything that goes on there., 615686=Everyone in the dorms are nice and the dorm quality is outstanding. Also going to have lots of dorms remodeled coming 2013., 598196=Mizzou is great for every type of student, really. It is large enough to be able to sneak through in you are more introverted or leave school with 1000 friends (and not just 1000 added Facebook friends)., 632447=Especially if you're in-state, Mizzou is definitely well worth what you pay for your education. If you're out-of-state, Missouri is the easiest state to earn in-state status--just earn $2000 and have a residence in Missouri (e.g. your residence hall or apartment)., 210814=mu has many dinning halls for students. they offer many kinds of food. since 2011, mu open a new place, called student center dining. it offers many choices like pizza, burgers, drinks and sushi. it is so convenient and so nice. in addition, student can buy meal plan for the dining halls, so the average price of each meal is about 8 dollars., 881463=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 41613=Downtown Columbia has plenty of great restaurants, bars, etc. True/False Film Festival every year in late February / early March., 713718=I will be attending this school in August and I am very excited. I have done research and heard so much great things about this school. That has helped me make my choice to attend here, this school will help farther me education., 400948=There are a lot of traditions at Mizzou. In August before classes begin the freshman assemble for Tiger Walk where they walk through the Columns toward Jesse Hall. Tiger Walk is symbolic of a student's entrance into the University of Missouri. When students graduate they walk through the columns away from Jesse Hall. This is Tiger Prowl and is symbolic of students becoming Mizzou alumni. There are seven traditions all students are supposed to do before they graduate: climb the dome of Jesse Hall, explore the tunnels, kiss the 50-yard line on Faurot Field, streak across the Quad, ride the tiger in Tiger Plaza, swim in Brady Fountain, and yell I love Mizzou! in Speakers Circle. I forewarn anyone that wants to attempt these that some of them are illegal., 731801=Classes definitely get harder as you go up. Don't think everything will be like your 1000-level days.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students anyone who has good study and organization skills, keeps up on grades and easily works with their instructors. Tips for prospective students if you go to this school, don't walk in and get pulled in by all the frills and thrills that the school offers. stay focused on your work, study, and then, if you have time, work in extra stuff that you can do on times when you have a gap between classes. don't forget, find scholarships and loans that you can use to pay for tuition and other costs. when looking at loans make sure it can be easily payed off later, you don't want it hanging over your head long after your out of school. find local jobs that can be easily worked into your school schedule and work for classes, my suggestion would be, if you like working with kids, adventure club. adventure club staff is predominantly college students and works great with any class schedule. finally, don't overload yourself with tons of extras and credit hours just because it says in your degree qualifications, this is only recommended for the students who want to get out quickly and are able to take the load. but don't let all of this bum you out, have fun when it's appropriate and find good friends that can help you through",
