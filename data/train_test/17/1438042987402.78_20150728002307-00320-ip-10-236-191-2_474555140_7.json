The intensity distribution of the irradiation is schematically indicated by arrows which differ in width to show this variation. Methods based on this principle are employed for improving the temperature distribution in the known rapid thermal processing systems, as for example discussed in the publications of Varian GmbH, D-7000 Stuttgart-Vaihingen, Brochure No. VAC 6057 and of the Peak Systems Incorporated, Fremont, USA, ALP 6000, of May 1986.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the application has been described with respect to preferred embodiments, it is not to be so limited as changes and modifications can be made which are within the scope of the appended claims. The method of the invention can be employed at all usable temperatures and can also be utilized in multi-stage tempering cycles. The control of the intensity IZ of the additional irradiation can also occur by using pre-calculated curves of the required intensity values. The invention also comprises methods wherein the under side or the upper side of the semiconductor wafer are irradiated by a main irradiation arrangement. As shown in FIG. 11, a single irradiation source 63 comprising an arced shaped reflector 111 which spans around the irradiation source 63 and the semiconductor wafer 1 can be used as the main irradiation source with the dimensions being selected such that a corresponding, distance-dependent intensity distribution of the irradiation is achieved. A rectangularly shaped reflection chamber 101 can be used as the reflector which entirely encloses the semiconductor wafer 1 and the irradiation source can be a plurality of light sources 103, for example, tungsten lamps as shown in FIG. 10. FIGS. 10 and 11 illustrate a further development of the invention wherein an irradiation source 103 or 62 and reflectors 101 and 111 are arranged above the semiconductor wafer 1 as a main irradiation arrangement which is designed such that the upper",
