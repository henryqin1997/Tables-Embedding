Greek Life there is some, but not many. Clubs and Activities i have to say, aic has just about any club you can imagine. if they don't have a club that you are interested in, it is very easy to start one yourself. sports are huge here. Great for these types of students it is good for students who need more individualized attention in their classes. not good for someone seeking a party school... Share",
