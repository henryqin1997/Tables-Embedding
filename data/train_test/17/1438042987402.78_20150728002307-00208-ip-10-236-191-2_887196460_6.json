            "This college is great for any student who has at least one goal that sets them off in a direction.",
            "Be sure to attend classes regularly or else you may fall behind in your work, even if you are ahead. If you don't attend classes regularly, you may fall into the habit of almost always skipping, which would result in\u2013eventually\u2013neglecting to do the work. Also, take advantage of the activities and such the school offers, it'll make the college experience all the more fun.",
            "The prices are reasonable for what everything is worth. You often get what you paid for.",
            "The laid-back atmosphere on campus provides a comfortable feeling of relaxation while studying. You don't get a sense of being extremely stressed, even when it is exam week(s). In addition to this, talking to other students and teachers is very easy.",
            "Due to small-sized classes, there is more interaction with the teachers and the rest of the students in the class as compared to a large-sized class. Being taught in such an environment allows you to really get the material down. Furthermore, most teachers are nice and open, and are readily available to help in any way they can."

I started this process late in July, so had to wait until after the semester started to get any financial aid. Then go online to the Leeward website and figure out what major and classes you want to take. I'll say it again..start early!, 213401=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 206390=The food is good, but expensive, plus they only except cash. Except for Subway, (They have a Subway there obviously) But our school throws many events, and at these events there is always great food. For our Halooween party this past wednesday on 10/29/2014 We had cupcake trucks and local food trucks. I ate Pastele Stew with Gandule Rice, along with Red Velvet Malasada Cheesecake Bites. and it was only 15.00 dollars for the both of tjem. it was very delicious., 112250=Student ID is free and qualifies you for student discounts at the movie theaters and on the bus. Parking on campus is always hard to find, but if you're lucky you'll find street parking. Price per unit here is $101 for Hawaii residents (2012 price). $1212 for 12 units. I bought my books at amazon.com for around $200 total.}",
