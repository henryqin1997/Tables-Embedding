I am assuming that like all the previous TM games (save for the Nations freeware), this one will contain a variety of environments. The games (TM2, ShootMania, QuestMania) will be released one environment at a time, so yes, Canyon is the initial TM2 env. Read up on the ManiaPlanet forums for how all this is planned. \u00a0 \u00a0",
