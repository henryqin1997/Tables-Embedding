This probably isn't what you want since no school work is accually shown, he is fighting deliquents so he can have peace of mind to study... Though there is a romance subplot. ________________ An instant or an eternity. Both are the same, in the passing of an instant lies the beauty of eternity. -Ginen Shounen Because I am a small man, my heart is moved by what's in front of my eyes, not by what the whole world needs. -D.Gray-man",

Spoiler (highlight to view) I found it really funny whenever Ran told Conan about her feelings for Shinichi. xD Shinichi & Conan are the same person...except Conan is the name he uses throughout most of the series because he was drugged...and his body shrank to that of an elementary school kid."
