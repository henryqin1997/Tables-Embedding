The different amplicon sizes allow you to distinguish between engogenous and exogenous expression. Stem Cell Pluripotency Status Check Kit with PCR Primers The Pluripotency Check PCR Kit contains all the necessary reagents to confirm that your mouse stem or iPS cells are indeed pluripotent. It includes 16 prevalidated forward and reverse primer mixes, based on nine genes expressed in pluripotent stem cells and two control genes. The kit includes everything for start-to-finish confirmation of your cells\u2019 pluripotency status, using any combination of primer sets, or the entire panel.
