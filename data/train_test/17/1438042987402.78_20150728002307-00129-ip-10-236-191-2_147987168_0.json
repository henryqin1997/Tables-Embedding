Site decoration can be customized with skins. Doxia Site Skins Documents can be dynamically generated with Doxia Sink API, like Maven reports, or simply read from static files, eventually processed by Velocity if their file names end in .vm. A default site decoration is included (see default-site.vm), but other decorations can be used at will, either as a standalone template or packaged in a skin artifact (containing a META-INF/maven/site.vm template). The Site Renderer handles the rendering of sites, assembling a common site decoration with a collection of documents. Doxia Site Tools - Site Renderer",
