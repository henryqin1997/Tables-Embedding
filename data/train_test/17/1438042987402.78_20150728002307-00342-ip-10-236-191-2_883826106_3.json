Approach them by asking for details (i.e. Socratic questioning), rather than challenging the competence of the writer (ad hominem). As the channel grows, we see a diverse range of people with different programming backgrounds getting accustomed to Haskell. Be patient and take satisfaction from spreading knowledge. Helpful answers should be encouraged with name++ karma points, in public, as a reward for providing a good answer. Low to zero tolerance for ridiculing questions. Insulting new users is unacceptable. New Haskell users should feel entirely comfortable asking questions. To maintain the friendly, open culture, the following is required: Part of the #haskell success comes from the fact that the community is quite tight knit \u2014 we know each other \u2014 it's not just a homework channel. As a result, many collaborative projects have arisen between Haskell irc channel citizens. The #haskell channel is a very friendly, welcoming place to hang out, teach and learn. The goal of",

Their names and usage are described here. 6.1 lambdabot Lambdabot is both the name of a software package and a bot on the channel. It provides many useful services for visitors to the IRC channel. It is available as a haskell package and can be integrated into ghci. Details on the software are found on a separate wiki page. Here is its interface for the IRC user: lambdabot's commands are prepended by a '@' sign. Command Usage @help display help to other commands, but help text is not available for all commands. @type EXPR or ':t' EXPR shows the type of an expression @kind TYPECONSTRUCTOR shows the kind of a type constructor @run EXPR or '>' EXPR evaluates EXPR @pl FUNCTION shows a pointfree version of FUNCTION @pointful FUNCTION or '@unpl' FUNCTION shows a 'pointful' version of FUNCTION @tell <nick> <msg> --",
