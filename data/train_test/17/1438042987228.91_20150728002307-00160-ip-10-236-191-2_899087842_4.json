            "Hard-working, self-motivated, socially diverse, and open-minded students are the perfect match for Purdue. Students who are looking for a college where they can mix fun and education would find a home at Purdue.",
            "Don't take too many credit hours your first semester. It will be easier to get yourself acclimated to the new environment and find activities and clubs to become a part of if you aren't bogged down with hours of studying and homework. I would suggest taking 15-16 credit hours your first semester, and then bumping it up to 17-18 credit hours your second semester. Also, you shouldn't skip class. A lot of professors do put their notes online, but the notes can never make up for actually being there in person. Many professors have in-class quizzes or take attendance, so skipping class can hurt your grade. Attendance points are the easiest way to help yourself get good grades. Being in lecture also helps when it comes to test time. A lot of professors will go over previous exams and take questions during lecture to help you get ready. Also, just having been to lecture helps with studying and cuts down on the time you have to spend preparing outside of class. One final suggestion: bring a good umbrella and good rain shoes. West Lafayette has a pretty wet spring, and there's nothing worse than sitting in lecture for 50 minutes with wet socks on.",
            "If you are an Indiana resident, then Purdue is the perfect place for you to attend. The tuition is much cheaper than many private colleges who offer the same programs of study. If you aren't an Indiana resident, Purdue is still a nationally recognized college for excellence. With scholarships and grants, the out of state tuition can be very affordable as well. The programs of study here are well worth the cost of attendance.",
            "Purdue offers a wide variety of clubs and societies for students to participate in. There are also frequent events on campus that are both promotional to a certain company or aimed at recruitment for different clubs, etc. Also, the campus is located in the city, so there are always things to do and places to go off campus. A lot of the surrounding community is diverse and interesting, with many stores well within walking distance or along the bus route. You will never be left without something to do. Also, there are so many study groups and areas for students to come together and help each other with homework, studying for exams, and just have fun while getting work done.",
            "I am in the College of Science, and the classes are challenging, but not so difficult as to be unmanageable. The course studies for all majors are rigorous and test your abilities at time management and focus. The pace is much quicker than in high school, but not so quick as to leave you racing to keep up."

Usually, after a winning home game, the student section will sprint across campus and run through the two fountains in celebration. It is especially great on hot days in august and september! Also, you have to make a stop at the discount den and buy a den pop (yes, we call it pop, not soda). A den pop allows you to mix different drinks together, all for a cheap price., 886002=There are over 1000 clubs on campus, I'm sure you can find something!, 168321=Definitely take a tour. This lets you get a feel for the dorms and how far they will be from your classes. If your from out of state, definitely ask about the weather. Several of my friends had to make emergency trips to Walmart because they didn't have any winter clothing. If you can, try leaving your winter clothes at home for the warm months, and then switching your wardrobe over a break, so that you don't bring more clothes than you have room for, because you won't need that cute turtleneck sweater in August., 1103428=When you apply, be creative and be yourself. Apply by November 1st so that you can be considered for Scholarships and Honors College., 124742=Friday night's before home football games there is a walk with the team over the bridge . The marching band plays for the crowd as they march through the campus before each home game ., 152267=Do not schedule classes before 8:30 am ever and meet as many people as possible. There are 20,000 different students at Purdue, surely there is someone that you can connect with and friends make the experience that much better!, 877891=Try and really reach out during BGR, but don't feel bad if you don't click with the people from your group! My best friends were ones that I met through my roommate. Also, if you want to get an apartment, sign in October to get the best choice! We signed early November, and we were almost too late!, 856517=I've only been there once, but it was a fun experience. I learned a lot about Purdue, and may attend this coming fall of 2013., 435076=hanging out with friends are always great, going to the union is a good option. you can bowl or play pool, or simply just have a cup of coffee and chat with friends. the new gym will be completed in the fall of 2012, so you will have a great new place to workout and play sports. joining a club is always a good idea, there's no better way to meet other people who likes what you like too., 1082302=Very safe environment. Police officers are always around. Here is Purdue 2012-2013 Annual Security Report: http://www.purdue.edu/police/pdf/YourCampus.pdf, 746097=With almost 1000 clubs to join Purdue is the place for working out and having fun. JThey also just built a new recreation center as well which boasts a ton of sporting facilities and equipment. There is always something to do at Purdue in the fun sense., 694910=I've walked around at 3:30 am and felt perfectly at home.}",

The campus is within the city so students who love having many things to do on the weekends will love this school. Purdue is so active during the night and this makes the campus an amazing place to be. Tips for prospective students Make sure you go to all of your classes. Many professors will give extra credit points or actual points for good attendance. Most of your classes will not have a lot of homework and only a few tests so every point you earn is important. There are rarely any easy points in college. Set aside time to study each week, that way you won't panic when the tests come around. For many of the harder classes, it is recommended to begin studying for test",
