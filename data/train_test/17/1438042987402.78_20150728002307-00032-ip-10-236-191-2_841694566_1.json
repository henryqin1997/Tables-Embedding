These contracts have not been raised since 2004 compared to the company\u2019s growth in pricing per carload, which shot up more than 70% over the same period. The company has a $350 million legacy contract, scheduled for re-pricing in early 2013, which is expected to be accretive to its operating profits., 21973=The company continues to expect an improved operating ration ranging 65\u201367% by 2015 and operating margins excluding fuel to reach 50%. We believe the company has opportunities to improve yields backed by higher rate of contract re-pricings compared to its Class I peers and increased access to West Coast intermodal business and energy related markets., 63176=At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1986 it has nearly tripled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +26% per year. These returns cover a period from 1986-2011 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly, an independent accounting firm.}",
