During the seder, if you touched your nose or ear you were to speak as if you were the personality on your paper. The object of the game was to return to the correct personality their item and book. I shuffled these up and gave one paper from each set to each of our participants, i.e. each person got one random personality, one random item, and one random book. I make three sets of papers: personalities, items, and books. There was one paper in each set for each of my seder participants; we were twelve people for seder, so I made twelve personalities, and each personality had a corresponding item and book. I created this game in the last few minutes before Passover began (actually, before shabbat began). Passover Game: Roles and Items Sunday, April 20, 2008 Labels: personal, travel",
    "textAfterTable": "This was last minute, so some of these could be better, and some items could belong to more than one person. But you get the idea. In any case, the game went over pretty well, so there you go. Yehuda [1] Helps with hard hearts. [2] Helps with chapped lips. [3] Yocheved's husband wanted to separate from his wife so as not to produce any babies. [4] Miriam watched Moses in the Nile from afar. [5] Aaron had many clothes as high priest. [6] Tzipporah needed this to chase away shepherds at the well. [7] To put onto his strong hand and outstretched arm. [8] Yitro heard about what happened to Israel in a distant land. [9] Serach was very old and knew the correct code words that would identify a real savior for the Jewish people. 2 comments: Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter",
