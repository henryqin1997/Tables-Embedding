            "Food can be improved. The variety of food is very limited at Carolina, and by the end of the day students do get tired of eating the same food over and over again.",
            "Dorm life varies from dorm to dorm. Certain dorms which are more expensive provide a better standard of living then others. Most dorms have a copy center on the ground floor and laundry machines in the basement.",
            "The academic curriculum at Carolina varies from class to class. Certain classes require more time others do not. However, their is no class which is not passable or a way to make an A.",
            "Keep up with your class notes, take a recorder to class if you deem it necessary in order to record the lectures word for word. Try to participate in as many activities as possible in order to keep yourself occupied and mind running. The more occupied you are the faster one's mind works",
            "University of South Carolina provides a wide range of extracurricular activities for all groups of people. Football season and atmosphere is unlike any other university or college, students from all over the state come together to support the gamecocks. The student-professor relationship is very friendly and professors encourage students to meet them during their perspective office hours."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{585634=Carolina is all about tradition. One of our strangest, but also the tastiest, is Chicken Finger Wednesday. Also, the campus is full of beautiful historical sites, as the University was built in 1801. It has survived a number of wars and events in history, and that history is alive on campus., 816402=Classes are fairly challenging. Lectures with one professor can reach up to a ratio of 120:1, so peel out those listening ears!, 860405=For the 2013-2014, the women's quad has been shut down due to renovations. For the upcoming school year those dorms are said to be bigger and better. And looking at the past dorm renovations USC has done has been pretty awesome. Also over the next 5 years USC is expected to build a couple more dorms. I promise they never fail to disappoint with new technology installed and eco-friendly dorms., 31046=Schedule classes earlier during the day so you will be more than likely to go! I'm not saying to take all 8 o'clock classes, but the sooner in the day you go to class, the sooner you are done. Also, make sure to get a planner! There are so many assignments to keep up with. Labs for certain classes are also scheduled at a different time than lecture, so it can be easy to forget to go., 548673=The Greek Life is one of the main parts of social life at the University of South Carolina. With over 700 freshmen boys and several hundred freshmen girls trying to rush in 2012, it is readily apparent the Greek Life is very popular and highly sought after., 1069226=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 400204=USC has its own police sqaud that patrol the campus to ensure the safety of its students. Around campus are many emergency boxes that light up the area and make students feel safe. Campus security has been ramped up the past few years starting in 2012 and continues to be a top priority for USC officials., 970431=The Univeristy of South Carolina's Resident Halls are excellent! Currently being renovated is what will be known as the Women's Quad which will house many female student-residents in the coming 2014 Fall academic year. Other residental halls include the Apartment-Style Quads (West Green Quad, South Quad, & East Quad), McBryde (all Male Hall), and the Honor's College Resident Hall. Here at the university, all first-year freshman students are guarenteed housing. The Resident Mentors, 1000172=The meal plan here is frustrating to me. You have to choose a set number of meals you want to eat a week and then you receive a corresponding number of meal swipes of the card. The catch is that you have to use them all in a week otherwise the money goes to waste! The meal timing is divided into four sections. There is breakfast from about 0730-1100, lunch at 1100-1600, dinner from 1600-0000, and then something called midnight swipe from 0000-0300. You can only spend a swipe once during a meal period meaning you can't use two swipes during breakfast. Also, you can only use a meal swipe for the midnight period if you've missed a meal period during the day. For example, if I ate breakfast and dinner, but skipped lunch, I can go to an on campus restaurant that is open after midnight and spend a swipe there. The swipes are also like credit, and the credit is different for each period. This means if you buy food that costs more than the credit, you have to pay the difference somehow. You can find a list of all the restaurants on campus that use meal plan on the USC website. I would say that the selection is very good. There are fast food places like Chick-fil-a and Taco bell, dining lines similar to high school such as the Grand Market Place and Honeycomb Cafe, buffets like Bates, and even higher class eateries like Preston's. They also make a point to accommodate to every diet. You can find carnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options at the various restaurants., 972492=The University of South Carolina is a great school. If I had to rate it on a scale of 1-10, it would definitely get a 9.5! Established in 1806, the University of South Carolina gives its students a traditional home feeling with a taste of southern hospitality!, 114805=Five points can get sketchy at night but the Vista is always super safe. Campus itself is very good about security. With the Carolina Alert system, students and parents get immediate alerts if a threat is present. Walking across the horseshoe after my last class gets out at 9:30 p.m., I always see a minimum of two to three campus police walking around.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students This University is known to be a large party school, but my tip for you is to know what you want when you go into college. Do not fall for all of the drinking and the partying the college portrays. Rise above all of the stereotypes and excel! It is so easy to do at the University of South Carolina when you use all of its amazing resources offered. Work hard, make friends, get involved! You will never regret receiving an education from this University! Bang for the buck Any college you attend is going to be expensive and the University of South Carolina is a bit expensive, but if you compare the value of the education, organizations, functions, free events, amazing friends, great atmosphere, postivie influence to the amount of money you pay, I would say that the University of South Carolina is a great bang for your buck. Am enjoying being here I live in an on campus dormitory at the University of South Carolina and I love it! I love having freedom to come and go as I please and I love being able to have places to study as well.
