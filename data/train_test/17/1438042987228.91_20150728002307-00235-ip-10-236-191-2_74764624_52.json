Most effect titles match those found in the Alchemy menu for the sake of simplicity, but some do not. Potions Edit [show] Contents For potions created through the use of the Alchemy skill, see this page. Potions can be purchased, found, or even created. This page deals strictly with potions and poisons found in the game environment and the inventories of NPCs, like vendors and so forth. All potions and poisons weigh () 0.5 units. Poisons, on the other hand, are applied to weapons and detrimentally affect the targeted NPC. Potions help by restoring health/magicka/stamina, fortifying an ability or the effect of an ability, or otherwise benefiting the Dragonborn. There are two different subdivisions of potions. Potions are consumable items found throughout the province of Skyrim and the rest of Tamriel. Many potions are leveled to accommodate the needs of the ever-growing Dragonborn. For created potions, see Created Potions (Skyrim).",
