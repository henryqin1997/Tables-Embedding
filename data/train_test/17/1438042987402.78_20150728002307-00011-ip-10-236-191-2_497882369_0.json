    "textAfterTable": "Our sizing is easy! We still use the European way of sizing by height in centimeters because it's easy and makes good sense - since every child grows at their own pace all you need to do is measure their height for a good fit. There's no need to \"buy big.\" Our clothes have plenty of growth room, so go ahead and order the correct size on our chart - there's no need to \"buy big.\" We can't stress this enough! Whether you choose an item that's prewashed or one that has shrinkage built in, every hanna garment is designed for a good fit with room for growth. How to use our size chart: Just measure your child from the top of the head to the floor in inches, then use the chart to convert to centimeters. Call us with any questions and we'll be happy to help you get the right fit. Height is the one and only measure you need to order hannas - we can't stress this enough - measure the height for a good fit. Weight may be helpful if a child is above or below average weight. Age isn't nearly as accurate as using the height (since kids all grow at different rates!). It's helpful when sending out-of-town gifts.
