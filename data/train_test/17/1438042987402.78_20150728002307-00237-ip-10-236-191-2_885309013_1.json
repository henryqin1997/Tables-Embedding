            "Central would be great for hard working students who also like to have fun and make friends. It is a perfect size campus for feeling comfortable around everyone and getting to know a lot of people its small enough to walk across and is very pretty so if you like walking it is a good campus because we have a park rite off of campus. It is also a great campus for students who want to be teacher because it has the reputation of being one of the best teaching colleges in Connecticut.",
            "I would suggest that if you go to this school buy your books online i bought mine at half.com and the cost so much less than they would have at the bookstore because being a college student we try and save as much money as we can because college is expensive. Also I would suggest that If you are a girl stay in the all girls dorm. I know that it may not sound to exciting but we have bigger dorms and it is quite a bit quieter here than in the other dorms. Finally i would suggest applying to the honors program because it has a great scholarship and you get to take some pretty cool classes because of it. Also if you dont like Central are other schools that go along with it like eastern and Western Connecticut State University that you could look into",
            "You get really great classes at central for what you pay and compared to other colleges in Connecticut central doesn't cost very much our bookstore however is rather expensive i would suggest shopping else where and the food is OK but it gets boring after a while as I'm sure it probably does at all colleges but as far as the education part (which is probably the most important ) you will be getting a wonderful learning experience for a reasonable amount of money for college.",
            "I really like being at school people here are very friendly and it is like living in a nice little community where everyone helps each other. We also have a lot of programs going on everyday and a weekly program on Thursday's called devils den at ten pm it is a fun program to go to and encourages kids to have clean fun instead of going off campus to drink and do other unsafe things. There are also great dorms here where everyone becomes friends with everyone else! The one downfall is that we don't have much to do here on weekends.",
            "I am in the Schools Honor program and am learning so much from all of my honors and non honors classes. most of my teachers have been very helpful and they all know what they are talking about and are enthusiastic about it. I am also learning a lot about life outside of the classroom here. Central provides a great environment for getting used to living away from home. The RA's and RD's are very helpful if you have room problems or if you just are looking for suggestions about school or activities you should attend I am learning how to manage my time with a lot of the programs so I have time to do my homework have some fun and even have a job if i want."

My friends and I during spring 2015 all took College writing but had different professors. My professor assigned only three essays all semester and for finals we could redo all three to hand in. My friends however had six essays due all year, were not allowed to redo them, and had a final exam which was an essay. So the academics and rigor truly depends on what teacher you choose. Another examples is in fall 2014 My math teacher assigned homework but never looked at it or checked it so nobody did the homework. For that class I got a C-. In spring 2015 my professor assigned a quiz every class so if you missed a class you failed a quiz. And all of the quizzes were based on the homework so you had to do the homework to pass. For that class I ended with an A-. So even though there are easy going professors in the school and the academic rigor depends on each individual professor, I would choose the professor who is in fact harder., 15559=Since CCSU is a state school, the price is very low compared to the expensive private schools most high school students strive for. Last year around March 2010, I was planning on going to a private school. After getting the financial report of $35,000 a year including all of the financial aid I received, I decided that going to a state school would be much more affordable. Looking back on my first year of college, I am no where near in debt because my scholarships went a long way. Not only is the school inexpensive, the bookstore runs a program where you can rent books for half of what the price would be. It only cost me about $250 last semester for books for 6 classes., 17053=Central is, in my opinion, one of the best schools in the state. I have learned so much from all of the wonderful teachers. Majoring in elementary education studying biology, I have begun to take classes pertaining to my specific major. In the spring 2011 semester, I took a child psychology class learning how young minds develop and how his/her environment is crucial to cognitive development. Overall, I have learned a lot in each of my classes and I feel like I am extremely challenged., 188870=There is a programming board on campus called Central Activities Network that I am actually a part of. We offer weekend as well as weekday programs. We have comedians, trips to new york, lectures, music and all other kinds of events. We have had artists such as LMFAO, Big Sean, and this year Kendrick Lamar come for our spring concert. Other clubs and departments have their own events in addition so there is almost always something going on., 304351=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 264293=Make sure to fill out the FAFSA before april or else you can become ineligible to receive grants based on academia. The school has numerous scholarships so please take the time to apply. Last, buy college books online because they are much cheaper through the internet than at the bookstore., 206535=Unlimited food for roughly $2000 a semester. It can be easily worth it if you make it worth it. The food is average, sometimes it is better than others., 247703=I rate this 5 stars because recently, on November 4th to be specific, we had our first college lock down. It was shown on national news and I know I could not have done a better job myself if I were the law enforcement officials. Everyone who was involved in protecting the college students and the college's faculty did a fantastic job. Our campus security was all over this and it's thanks to them that other law enforcement officials were notified.}",

Tips for prospective students Know full well beforehand that the weekends are dead on the weekends, so if you are looking for a party school, Central is not for you. I would suggest joining a club or team to get to know people on campus. I, personally, do not mind the commuters because I am friends with a lot of the athletes who always stay the weekends. Bang for the buck Definitely worth the money, especially if it's in-state tuition Am enjoying being here I am enjoying my experience here. Central is a good size school, so there",
