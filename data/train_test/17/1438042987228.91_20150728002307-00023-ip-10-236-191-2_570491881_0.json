We meet my cousin in the city for dinner. She lives near by. I like hitting diff. places each year, so when she and my mom suggested this place I did the normal look it up and see first. Anyways, we were there for about 3 hours and the service was fantastic and the food was the same. We were well taken care of and the prices were just right. I say this is the place to be. You even get to see some stars. Rockets eat there and even a star from the Big Apple Circus., 3925=Posted by nycfdcritic on 12/12/2010, 5956=Posted by Carol on 08/04/2010}",
