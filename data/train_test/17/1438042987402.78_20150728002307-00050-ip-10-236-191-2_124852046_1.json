Boyes (3) 5 - 4 NYI, 20328=For the first 30 years, the Coliseum was \u201cFort Neverlose\u201d in the playoffs as the Islanders went 77-32 on home ice. However, this is the Islanders\u2019 first playoff win at the Coliseum since winning all three of their home games against the Maple Leafs in 2002. The win ends a seven-game home playoff losing streak, which ties the NHL record for consecutive home losses (with five other teams)., 24610=04:30 NYI M. Streit (2) Slap - ASST: C. Cizikas (2) AND B. Boyes (2) 4 - 4 TIE, 15998=@StapeNewsday Boyes intercepts clear, feeds Tavares, one save by Fleury, Tavares deposits rebound. 5-4 #Isles at 10:11., 24711=00:41 PIT P. Dupuis (4) Deflected - ASST: C. Kunitz (2) AND S. Crosby (4) 4 - 3 PIT, 23847=Mark Streit is the first Islander to have two goals in a playoff game since Jason Blake (4/10/04 at Tampa), the first to do so at the Coliseum since Mariusz Czerkawski (4/28/02 vs. Toronto) and first Islander defenseman to score twice in a playoff game since Denis Potvin (5/3/1983 vs. Boston) \u2026 Streit is the first defensemen to score twice in a playoff game since Sami Salo scored twice for Vancouver in 2011 \u2026 It was the first time Streit scored two goals in any game since March 15, 2009 and the first time any Isles defenseman did so since Andrew MacDonald did so on March 5, 2011 vs. St. Louis \u2026 Streit and Brian Strait are the first Islander defensemen to combine for three goals in a playoff game since May 14, 1981 (Denis Potvin-twice and Ken Morrow) and the first time in any game since February 9, 2010 vs. Washington (Streit, Freddy Meyer and Bruno Gervais). It was Strait\u2019s first NHL goal (regular season or playoffs)., 15648=Travis Hamonic played 28:42 to lead the Isles. Andrew MacDonald, who had led the Isles in ice time in the first three games, played 15:36 before leaving with an injury. Kris Letang led Pittsburgh with 26:17., 25133=06:19 NYI PPG - M. Streit (1) Wrist - ASST: T. Hamonic (1) AND B. Boyes (1) 2 - 1 NYI, 22191=Kyle Okposo now has three goals in the playoffs after having only four in the regular season; he also has a goal in three straight games \u2026 Casey Cizikas is the first Islander to go plus-4 in a playoff game since Steve Konroyd did so against Washington on April 16, 1987 and the first to do so in any game since Frans Nielsen was plus-4 on March 27, 2012 in Pittsburgh \u2026 Casey Cizikas (22 years, 2 months) is the youngest player to have at least one goal, at least two assists, and go at least plus-4 in a playoff game since Patrice Brisebois (21 years, 3 months) did so for Montreal on April 27, 1992 against Hartford \u2026 Both of John Tavares\u2019 goals in this series have come in the third period; 12 of his 28 regular season goals were also in the third \u2026 Brad Boyes is the first Islander with three assists in a playoff game since John Tonelli had three helpers on April 25, 1985 vs. Philadelphia \u2026 The Isles have outscored Pittsburgh 6-1 in the third period in the series \u2026 The Isles are 67-3 in playoff games that they score at least five goals and are 32-1 when they score at least six. It\u2019s the first time that they have scored six goals in a playoff game since April 23, 2002 vs. Toronto \u2026 Evgeni Malkin (two points in each game), Jarome Iginla, and Pascal Dupuis are the only players to have points in all four games of the series., 10964=Also: (1975) Jude Drouin scored the first overtime goal in Coliseum history at the 1:53 mark as the Isles cut Philadelphia\u2019s lead to 3 games to 1 with a 4-3 victory. It is still the earliest overtime goal ever scored in a playoff game at the Coliseum., 19882=A Long Islander gave the Penguins a 3-2 lead in the second period when Brandon Sutter scored his first career playoff goal. Sutter was born at Huntington Hospital when his father was the Islander captain. Brandon was almost 14 months old when Brent Sutter scored a double-overtime goal to beat the Rangers in April 1990., 24837=18:36 NYI K. Okposo (3) Wrist - ASST: T. Hamonic (2) AND M. Streit (3) 3 - 3 TIE, 24022=\u2022 GAME 6: at NYI Sat May 11, TBD, 10095=Eric Hornick has been the statistician on Islander home game telecasts since 1982. Information contained in \u201cThe Skinny\u201d has been gathered from various sources. Follow Eric @ehornick on Twitter., 12211=This series marks the 20th anniversary of the 1993 series between the teams. With the Islanders trailing the series 2 games to 1 (sound familiar), the teams met at the Coliseum on May 8 for Game 4. The game was tied 1-1 late in the second period when Tom Fitzgerald should have penalized for a high-stick; however referee Don Koharski sent Claude Loiselle to the box. Fitzgerald scored two goals (one late in the second and one early in the third) on the penalty as the Isles took a 3-1 lead. However that was only the beginning of one of wildest periods in Islander history as each team scored four times, all in the first 12:11 of the period. Derek King\u2019s second goal of the period broke a 5-5 tie and the Islanders then held on for a 6-5 win, knotting the series at two games each., 24078=\u2022 GAME 5: at PIT Thu May 9, 7:00 PM ET, 24933=11:03 PIT B.
