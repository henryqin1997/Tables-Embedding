            "VCU is notorious for being located in a dangerous neighborhood, but I assure you that VCU Police and the Richmond police are constantly patrolling the area. As long as you exercise some common sense (i.e. don't walk around at 2 am in places that are deserted), you will be perfectly safe. VCU also offers free escort services if you find yourself alone at night. All you have to do is call/use an app your phone to let them know where you are! And there are plenty of emergency boxes set up around campus in case you are in immediate danger!",
            "Is very active. We have tons of fraternities and sororities on campus, so if you're interested they are there!",
            "Name a service organization, and chances are we have it! American Red Cross, United 2 Heal, Emerging Health Care Leaders, and many more. Sports--we have groups for just about every sport (for every skill level!) We also have several cultural groups, that focus on dance, food, fashion, and other themes! And it is SO easy to start your own club here at VCU! The Commons also offers free movies every Friday and Saturday (bring your student ID). These usually air before the movies release on DVD so take advantage! The Commons also has BreakPoint, where you can play all the pool you want or just chill with friends. Cary St Center is our award winning gym that has tons of machines, a pool, track, tennis courts, badminton/volleyball courts, basketball courts...you name it! Trust me, you will never find yourself bored if you want to do something",

            "The compass, which is the intersection point between Shafer Dining court, Hibbs Hall, and Cabell Library, often has a variety of demonstrators and protestors voicing their many opinions. It can get pretty amusing to see how passionate some people can get! There are also some quirky restaurants around town, including some interesting food carts right on campus!",
            "I have absolutely love my time here. VCU housing, dining, and Richmond have made my stay so enjoyable, and I have made some amazing friends. I am also on the Presidential Scholarship, so I guess you can say VCU offers even more bang for the buck!",
            "Richmond is not a big city like New York City, but there is plenty of things to do. If you're into sports, students can get free entry into all VCU home basketball games (GO RAMS!) However, if you are a crazy fan you can sign up for Rowdy Rams for just $20. This will get you VIP entry and choice of seats for every home game, and priority for playoff games! Interested in baseball? Catch a Flying Squirrels game at the Diamond. Tickets are very cheap (only 10 dollars for seats right behind the dugout!) The city of Richmond also sponsors some amazing activities such as First Friday, when major art and entertainment venues set up tents and activities along Broad Street the first of each month. King's Dominion is a short bus ride away, and is a great if you love amusement parks. And we also have Carytown, with its assortment of shops, restaurants, and the historic Byrd Theater ($1 movies). And don't forget to catch a show at the historic Landmark Theater, which is right at the center of the VCU Campus! Short Pump, Shockoe Bottom, Belle Isle...the list goes on and on. Basically, you name it and we have it!",
            "Shafer Dining Court is the major hub for undergraduates that operates on a swipe system. The food is pretty good, and they do have variety throughout the week. However, please keep in mind that after a few years you will get bored of it! There are many many other options on campus, including Subway, Pizza Hut, Commons Grab and Go, Chick Filet, Cary Street Wraps, Bleacker Street, and Jonahs on the MCV Campus. You will definitely find your favorite spots on campus! Also, I have heard that there will be a Taco Bell and Burger King opening in the Fall 2013 semester, if that is something that makes you excited :)",
            "VCU has plenty of student dorms on campus. If you want the traditional atmosphere, you can live in Brandt, Johnson, or GRC with roommates and shared bathrooms. If you would like apartment style living, there are plenty of new VCU operated places around campus as well such as Cary Belvidere, West Grace North, and West Grace South. If you would like a single room with attached bathroom, apply to the Honors College and you are essentially guaranteed housing in the Honors College dorms! I lived in the Honors College dorms the first two years and I absolutely loved it. The privacy was great, but you also get to meet a lot of smart, hard-working individuals on your floor who will become close friends!",
            "As with any university, rigor depends on the classes and specific teachers. The sciences here are not easy, but they are very manageable. You should have no problem getting good grades as long as you study appropriately. There are some really challenging upper level courses in biomedical engineering and biology that are worthwhile. They really expand your understanding of the fields to a more conceptual framework of mind rather than pure memorization. Arts classes are very challenging, so make sure that you are ready to work!",
            "If you are interested in the arts, VCU has some of the top programs in the country with some of the brightest students. The university is currently making a new building as well for the arts. If you are interested in medicine, dentistry, or pharmacy then definitely apply for the Guaranteed Admissions Programs in those fields. I am currently in the 8 year BS/MD program and it really takes a lot of stress away from the undergraduate experience here, knowing that you have a spot waiting for you. VCU Hospitals have consistently ranked at the top of U.S News rankings for several different specialties, and is recognized as the best hospital system in Virginia. If you are interested in any of the above programs, apply early and make sure all materials have been submitted on time!",
            "VCU is a public university in Richmond, VA that is best known for its arts programs, basketball team, and health care programs. The Honors College provides the opportunity for students to apply for guaranteed admission to several of the VCU Professional Schools on the MCV Campus, including the School of Medicine, School of Dentistry, and School of Pharmacy. There is also significant merit aid available for those who have scored well on the SAT and have attained an excellent GPA in high school."

Its our pride and joy and has always been since 1985., 1033473=If you want to feel safe, sign up for Crime Alert on your cellular device. The moment something goes down at VCU or any area around the campuses, the police are there to inform you what is going on and if the situation continues to be dangerous. Late at night you can witness many cops patrolling the area for any suspicious activity. There are phones places around campus with a bright flashing red light that can be used in emergency situations. Also, the VCU emergency contact number is easy to remember. It is simply the area code (828) and 1234., 231363=This is my first year at VCU as a Criminal Justice major and let me say for my first semester I have learned a tremendous amount! The professors are very involved and excited about the opportunity to pour their knowledge into the students. When I first came in August 2011 I kept telling myself that there is no way that a professor is going to have time and the patience to meet one on one with a student i needed out of a class of 200 plus students. I was completely wrong! For the first semester I have had the pleasure to meet with each one of my professors to discuss ways that would help me excel in the class. This helped me settle into the academic part of college much easier. I have learned about distant cultures in my human societies and globalization class that I had no idea existed. I have also had the chance to have many open discussions on many great books that have been written in my textual analysis class. I feel as if I have gained a great amount of knowledge in one semester. Virginia Commonwealth University prides itself on being there for the students and faculty and creating a unique learning experience. In VCU doing that I have learned a lot., 786904=The list could go on and on, but I'll list a few of my favorites: 1) Go to Carytown: an awesome area just a short bus ride away with many shops, restaurants, and events. 2) Go to Basketball games: VCU has an excellent Division 1 program, competing with the best in the country. Flip on CBS in March, and you'll see us shock the world! 3) Hang out in the Commons: There are places to eat, an underground games area, and even a theater playing recent hits every weekend., 295385=There is a new tradition that started in 2010 where during orientation, the new students touch the Ram Horns outside of Commons. After doing so, they make a wish., 71427=After visiting VCU the first few times, I felt like I still needed some more info on the schools abilities. After orientation however, I can comfortably say I'm going to get a good education here. The way the freshmen experience is designed revolves around acclimating students to the college experience, building fundamental skills that will see us through the next four years. The only reason I won't give a five star for this category is because I still need to find out first hand when classes start in August., 1070436=The food in the dining hall is great. There are chain restaurants, like Subway, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell or individual restaurants like Stir Crazy. All of them are delicious. If you don't want to eat on campus, Richmond has nothing but amazing restaurants. The entire street that Village is on smells incredible, I'm disappointed that I didn't get to eat there while I was on campus. By 1:00, there was a line out the door and down the street for Village, and I could certainly smell why., 581654=This is a great university located in the city of Richmond, VA. I have attended here since 2006 and its is been a great experience. I am currently working on my master degree., 702372=VCU is very well known for having the best student section when it comes to our Men's Basketball team. Our Men's Basketball team has made Final Four in 2011., 786191=We have a homecoming week from the 27th of January to the 2nd of February, but the oddest thing I have ever seen was the Nearly-Naked Mile., 415783=There are literally over 1000 clubs here, we have clubs for absolutely everything it will blow your mind. We even have a Quidditch club, you know from Harry Potter? Lol honestly, there's something here for everyone., 909259=The food is great for the most part. When you get on campus for the first time, youll want to try almost everything, and there are swipes you can use from your meal plan. After while, of course, you will get kindof tired of eating almost the same kind of foods all the time. If you're trying to eat healthy, there are some options to choose from, but there are mostly fast food places, like chick fil a, and pizza hut. There is also going to be a Taco bell coming soon to Monroe park campus Fall 2013, 948803=Shafer Dining center has GREAT options for everyone. Although the quality of the taste of the food isn't the best, all of the food items are fully cooked and don't break any health violations. And they have an all day cereal bar, which is always great if you don't like anything else. Along with Shafer, the Student Commons also has several dining options such as Chick-fil-A, an Asian-style Stir Fry, a Taco Bell, and even more to come in 2013. There are also amazing restaurants around the campus! Many of them being hole-in-the-wall places. And a lot of the joint restaurants actually take meal swipes on certain days -- such as IHOP., 11330=The area is so much fun! I am living in one of the dorms on campus, and if you decided that dorm life isn't for you, it's okay. However, it is much easier to live here and go to the midnight breakfasts in Safer Court Dining Center. Or to participate in the Ram Ex-Scream at 9:00PM, when all you have to do is cut through an ally (that's well lit) and you're there., 21383=VCU School of the Arts is ranked by U.S. News and World Report as both the 1st public college art program and the 4th overall in the United States. Since being here, I certainly see why. However, it is still one of the cheapest ones around. VCU's art program has challenged me more than even my AP art class did. I like the curriculum here, too. During freshman year all potential art majors are in Art Foundation and start off running. This semester I had two studio classes, an art projects class, an art history class, and another honors art class. Next semester will again be two studio classes, one art projects class, and an art history class. In March of freshman year we then declare our top three choices for our art concentration. By exposing students to this much art as freshman, we can better see where our interests and strengths lie. By the end of Spring Semester freshman year, we then know in which discipline we will be placed, determining which specific curriculum we will pursue for the rest of our time at VCU. This makes a lot of sense to me, as art is a field in which a person must be passionate and really like what he is doing. The toughness of the curriculum early on allows students to see if this is what one really want to do for the rest of his life. If not, then the switch to another major can be made early in the college career. Since VCU is a large university of over 32,000 students, it offers a wide variety of activities. Finally, with Richmond as one of the cultural centers of Virginia, something happens there all of the time. In short, VCU and Richmond: something for everybody! Just look!, 160376=Shafer Dining Court is the major hub for undergraduates that operates on a swipe system. The food is pretty good, and they do have variety throughout the week. However, please keep in mind that after a few years you will get bored of it! There are many many other options on campus, including Subway, Pizza Hut, Commons Grab and Go, Chick Filet, Cary Street Wraps, Bleacker Street, and Jonahs on the MCV Campus. You will definitely find your favorite spots on campus! Also, I have heard that there will be a Taco Bell and Burger King opening in the Fall 2013 semester, if that is something that makes you excited :)}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot I don't have to tell you that VCU is quite a large university. Especially within the first few years here, most of one's classes will be larger lecture classes. Even so, all the professors I've had have let it be known to the students that they're open for individual consulting as long the student is willing to make it happen. Like at any university, a VCU student will realize how to learn based mostly on their own capabilities. The professors will provide you with a firm foundation of the material but ultimately, it's in the students hands how far to excel with the material. What I love about the professors at VCU is that they are still there for students, despite the enormity of some of the classes.
