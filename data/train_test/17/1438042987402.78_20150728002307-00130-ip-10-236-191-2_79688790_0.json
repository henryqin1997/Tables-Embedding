But I thought it would be interesting to take a poll for a pseudo-scientific study (i.e., just for fun) using my friends and family from the blog-o-sphere and our lab to determine one of the most important dependent variables influencing the use of electronic medical records (EMRs): I hear this all the time during my clinic visits. (What they don't realize is that many of those keystrokes are the backspace key to edit mistakes I make while typing.) \"My goodness, Mildred, look how fast he types!\" How Fast Are You?

    "textAfterTable": "It would be fun to see what your typing speed is, too! So here's how to add your data to the mix: 1) Go to typingtest.com. 2) Take the 1 minute typing test and record your typing speed calculated by the program and include the number of errors it found as well. 3) Enter your (a) age, (b) staff position, (c) Net typing speed in words per minute (the one AFTER the errors are subtracted out), (d) the number of errors you made, and whether you have ever had typing class or not, then enter the results in the comments section. If you make a mistake, take the best result from the first three tries from the test. This might just become the single largest depository of documented medical errors on the internet! Of course, it also explains why there is a propensity to keep EMR documentation on patients very, very brief. -Wes Posted by DrWes at 1/18/2011 03:20:00 PM 28 comments: Links",
