Therefore, the above description should not be construed as limiting, but merely as exemplifications of particular embodiments. Those skilled in the art will envision other modifications within the scope and spirit of the claims appended hereto. The stop member(s) may be dimensioned in any suitable geometric configuration and may be disposed on or adjacent to one or both of the electrically conductive tissue sealing surfaces or operatively associated with one or both jaw members. ) that operatively couples to one or more sensors (not shown) that determine or measure tissue thickness, tissue moisture, tissue type, tissue impedance, etc. and automatically signal the controller 510 to adjust the electrosurgical energy prior to or during the sealing process to optimize the tissue seal. FIG. 1A By controlling the intensity, frequency and duration of the electrosurgical energy applied to the tissue, the user can selectively seal tissue. The generator 500 may include a controller 510 (See ) that extends from the proximal end of the electrically conductive sealing surface 322 to the distal end.
