            "There are a lot of clubs and it is really easy to start a club if you don't see one your interested in.",
            "Its a little on the expensive side costing roughly 40-50k a year.",
            "Go off campus and hike. My suggestion would be get involved in Greek life, its a great way to get to know people!",
            "Sodexo is doing a good job thus far, be sure to eat at the Wow Cafe in the student union.",
            "Freshman dorms are awful, but if you can make it through that you can survive anything.",
            "Be sure to buckle down if your an engineer. Your fourth and fifth semesters will be the hardest. If your a pilot just know that this school is very expensive.",
            "Riddle is a very challenging school in your later years. There is also a very low population of women on campus. Great school for the engineers who want to be involved in Aerospace."

They have mediocre food, but luck fully this upcoming fall 2012 semester SODEXO is taking over the campus dining and bringing in stores like Starbucks. I believe that the food should definitely be better this next upcoming semester., 298200=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 3100=Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Prescott has a huge advantage when it comes to classroom learning. The university is fairly small, an estimated 1500 students total which provides a small faculty-student ratio. Many of my fellow peers who attend other universities dislike being known as a number in their huge auditorium classes and feel they don't learn as well because they cannot freely ask questions. At Embry-Riddle, not only do the professors know your name, but also assist in campus events and dine in the cafeteria amongst other students. Classrooms are course specific, so a math class will not take place in a physics or materials classroom. Professors also have a wide range of their own credible experience in the field, so students are given life experiences in addition to the course outline., 120443=A school that is primarily focused on aviation, with the two biggest majors being aerospace engineering and aeronautical science (pilots). It's a pretty small campus with only 1800 students, and small, manageable class sizes. Students seem to be more focused on their education here, as compared to having a social life or partying., 112304=I have attended the Accepted Students Reception. I cannot wait to visit the Prescott campus in April. I think Embry-Riddle is the one for me., 145422=Getting better, a new contractor for 2012 will bring changes to the campus food.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students A great tip for reducing the cost is take some of the General Education classes in a community college if the belt is a little tight on the budget. This will help reduce the impact of the school and bring a little recognition from your peers because you will be slightly ahead of those around you. Bang for the buck This school undeniably leaves a hole in the wallet with the cost of 42k a year, 21k per semester, but is definitely worth the bang. The atmosphere of the school, classes, and friendly people make it worth the while. The fact that many advanced programs such as Matlab, Linux, wind tunnels, and labs are available to students of all grades from freshman to sophomores. Am enjoying being here There is a lot to do in Embry-Riddle, let alone Prescott, AZ. in Embry riddle there are a variety of clubs, games, fields and activities. I personally am part of the sword fighting club, particle acceleration club, and martial arts/boxing club and i love to hang out in the student union. There are pool tables, ping pong tables, air hockey tables, Foosball tables, and even xbox 360s and wiis. In Prescott there are movie theatres, lakes, shopping centers, and excellent trails for hikes, mountain",
