Cells were also counted by direct microscopic observation of gridded culture dishes. The grids were scored into the plastic on the inner surface, so that the cells could not migrate into or out of the area being counted during the experiment. Cells in each of four squares in two separate wells were counted at each time point. All cell counting experiments were repeated on at least three separate cultures., 51326=For prevention of restenosis following angioplasty, an example of a higher trauma injury or intervention resulting in a stronger acute proliferative stimulus to smooth muscle cells, a higher dose would be required. For example, a dosing regimen is contemplated which involves a single \"pre-loading\" dose (or multiple, smaller pre-loading doses) given before or at the time of the intervention, with a chronic smaller (follow up) dose delivered daily for two to three weeks or longer following intervention. For example, a single pre-loading dose may be administered about 24 hours prior to intervention, while multiple preloading doses may be administered daily for several days prior to intervention. An exemplary single pre-loading dose is about 50 mg/kg (ranging between about 10 and about 1000 mg/kg), while an exemplary multiple pre-loading individual dose is about 10 mg/kg/day (ranging between about 0.01 and 10 mg/kg/day)., 17207=This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/061,714, filed May 13, 1993 now abandoned., 55191=Cell culture, DNA synthesis assay and cell counting. Rat vascular smooth muscle cells were cultured after enzymatic dispersion of the aortic media from 12-17 week old Wistar rats as described in Grainger et al., Biochem. J., 277: 145-151, 1991. When the cells reached confluence (after about 6 days) the cells were released with trypsin/EDTA (available from Gibco) and diluted 1:2 in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium (DMEM; available from ICN/Flow) supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). The cells were then replated on tissue culture plastic (available from ICN/Flow) at approximately 1\ufffd104 cells/cm2. The cells were subcultured repeatedly in this way when confluence was attained (about every 4 days), and the cells were used between passages 6 and 12., 61108=RNA Preparation and Northern Analysis. Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from cultured vascular smooth muscle cells as described in Kemp et al., Biochem. J., 277: 285-288, 1991. Northern analysis was performed by electrophoresis of total cytoplasmic RNA in 1.5% agarose gels in a buffer containing 2.2M formaldehyde, 20 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM sodium acetate and 0.5 micrograms/ml ethidium bromide. The integrity of the RNA was checked by visualizing the gel under UV illumination prior to transfer onto Hybond N (available from Pharmacia LKB) as specified by the manufacturer. Filters were hybridized as described in Kemp et al., Biochem. J., 277: 285-288, 1991, using a [32 P]-oligolabeled mouse TGF-betal probe corresponding to amino acids 68-228 in the precursor region of the TGF-betal polypeptide as set forth in Millan et al., Development, 111: 131-144., 50304=For TGF-beta activators or production stimulators, such as tamoxifen, several exemplary dosing regimens are contemplated, depending upon the condition being treated and the stage to which the condition has progressed. For prophylactic purposes with respect to atherosclerosis, for example, a low chronic dose sufficient to elevate in vivo TGF-beta production is contemplated. An exemplary dose of this type is about 0.1 mg/kg/day (ranging between about 0.1 and about 10 mg/kg/day). Another exemplary dose range is from about 0.01 to about 1000 micrograms/ml. Such low doses are also contemplated for use with respect to ameliorating stenosis following relatively low trauma injury or intervention, such as vein grafts or transplants or organ allografts, for example. No adverse side effects (e.g., nausea as experienced by recipients of higher dose administrations when tamoxifen has been employed in the treatment of breast cancer) are anticipated with respect to these chronic or low dosing regimens., 56027=Rat adventitial fibroblasts were cultured as described in Grainger et al., Biochem. J., 283: 403-408, 1992. Briefly, the aortae were treated with collagenase (3 mg/ml) for 30 minutes at 37\ufffd C. The tunica adventitia was stripped away from the media. The adventitia was dispersed for 2 hours in elastase (1 mg/ml) and collagenase (3 mg/ml) dissolved in medium M199 (available from ICN/Flow). The cells were then spun out (900\ufffdg, 3 minutes), resuspended in DMEM+10% FCS and plated out at 8\ufffd104 cells/cm2 on tissue culture plastic. When the cells reached confluence (after about 10 days), they were subcultured as described for vascular smooth muscle cells. Adventitial fibroblasts were subcultured every 3 days at 1:3 dilution and used between passages 3 and 9., 65025=Based upon these results, it appeared that tamoxifen exhibited effects similar to those previously described for TGF-beta (see, for example, Assoian et al., J. Cell. Biol., 109: 441-448, 1986) with respect to proliferation of subcultured vascular smooth muscle cells in the presence of serum. Tamoxifen is known to induce TGF-beta activity in cultures of breast carcinoma cell lines as described, for example, in Knabbe, et al., Cell, 48: 417-425, 1987. Consequently, experimentation was conducted to determine whether tamoxifen decreased the rate of proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells by inducing TGF-beta activity. When quiescent vascular smooth muscle cells were stimulated with 10% FCS in the presence of 50 micromolar tamoxifen and 10 micrograms/ml neutralizing antiserum against TGF-beta, the cells proliferated at the same rate as control cells in the presence of ethanol vehicle alone., 56827=DNA synthesis was assayed by [3 H]-thymidine incorporation as described in Grainger et al., Biochem. J., 277:145-151, 1991. Vascular smooth muscle cells were subcultured, grown in DMEM+10% FCS for 24 hours, made quiescent in serum-free DMEM for 48 hours and restimulated with 10% FCS at \"0\" hours. [3 H]-thymidine (5 microcuries/ml; available from Amersham International) was added 12 hours after restimulation and the cells were harvested after 24 hours. DNA synthesis by adventitial fibroblasts was determined similarly, except that the cells were made quiescent in serum-free DMEM for 24 hours., 63921=To determine whether tamoxifen increased the duration of the cell cycle of vascular smooth muscle cells by increasing the duration of the G0 to S phase, the effect of tamoxifen on entry into DNA synthesis was analyzed. Tamoxifen at concentrations up to 50 micromolar did not significantly affect the time course or the proportion of cells entering DNA synthesis following serum stimulation of quiescent vascular smooth muscle cells (DNA synthesis between 12 hours and 24 hours after stimulation was measured by [3 H]-thymidine incorporation: control at 17614+/-1714 cpm; 10 micromolar tamoxifen at 16898+/-3417 cpm; and 50 micromolar tamoxifen at 18002+/-4167 cpm). Since the duration of S phase is approximately 12 hours (unpublished data), tamoxifen does not appear to have significantly impacted the time course of entry into DNA synthesis. These results therefore imply that tamoxifen decreases the rate of proliferation of serum-stimulated vascular smooth muscle cells by increasing the time taken to traverse the G2 to M phase of the cell cycle., 18246=For example, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is widely used as the primary treatment modality in many patients with coronary artery disease. PTCA can relieve myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease by reducing lumen obstruction and improving coronary flow. The use of this surgical procedure has grown rapidly, with 39,000 procedures performed in 1983, nearly 150,000 in 1987, 200,000 in 1988, 250,000 in 1989, and over 500,000 PTCAs per year are estimated by 1994. Stenosis following PTCA remains a significant problem, with from 25% to 35% of the patients developing restenosis within 1 to 3 months. Restenosis results in significant morbidity and mortality and frequently necessitates further interventions such as repeat angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery. No surgical intervention or post-surgical treatment (to date) has proven effective in preventing restenosis., 34092=Lp(a) consists of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and apo(a). Apo(a) shares approximately 80% amino acid identity with plasminogen (see MacLean et al., Nature, 330: 132, 1987). Lp(a) has been found to inhibit cell-associated plasminogen activity (see, for example, Harpel et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86: 3847, 1989). Experiments conducted on human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells derived from healthy transplant donor tissue, cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM)+10% fetal calf serum (FCS) as described in Grainger et al., Biochem. J., 283: 403, 1992, indicated the following:, 59029=Assays for TGF-Beta. The TGF-beta activity present in medium conditioned on various cells was determined by DNA synthesis assay on mink lung endothelial (MvLu) cells; a modification of the assay described in Danielpour et al., J. Cell. Physiol., 138: 79-83, 1989. MvLu cells were subcultured at 1:5 dilution in DMEM+10% FCS. After 24 hours, the medium was replaced with the conditioned medium to be tested in the absence or presence of the neutralizing antiserum to TGF-beta at 10 micrograms/ml. DNA synthesis during a 1 hour pulse of [3 H]-thymidine (5 microcuries/ml) was determined 23 hours after addition of the test medium. TGF-beta activity was calculated as the proportion of the inhibition of DNA synthesis which was reversed in the presence of neutralizing antibody, using a standard curve to convert the inhibition values into quantities of TGF-beta. The TGF-betal standards and conditioned media both contained 10% FCS in DMEM.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes While in the foregoing specification this invention has been described in relation to certain preferred embodiments thereof, and many details have been set forth for purposes of illustration, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention is susceptible to additional embodiments and that certain of the details described herein may be varied considerably without departing from the basic principles of the invention. Although TGF-beta decreases the rate of proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, it does not affect the rate of proliferation of fibroblasts. Tamoxifen at concentrations of up to 50 micromolar did not reduce the rate of proliferation of subcultured adventitial fibroblasts. Tamoxifen is therefore a selective inhibitor of vascular smooth muscle proliferation with an ED50 at least 10-fold lower for vascular smooth muscle cells than for adventitial fibroblasts. The content of TGF-betal mRNA was also analyzed by Northern analysis at various time points after addition of tamoxifen. Subcultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells (6th passage in exponential growth) in the absence or presence of ethanol vehicle alone contain very little mRNA for TGF-betal. By 24 hours after addition of tamoxifen (10 micromolar), TGF-betal mRNA was increased approximately 10-fold. Heparin increases TGF-beta activity in medium conditioned on vascular smooth muscle cells (unpublished data). The mechanism of action of heparin in this regard appears to involve the release of TGF-beta from inactive complexes present in serum, because pretreatment of serum",
