            "Security is 24/7 at the campus. Security cameras, parking permits, ID badges, zero weapon policy... even the school's location make this a safe place to work within the property. The only time I don't feel safe is the walk home at night due to the fact there are no dorm rooms on-campus.",
            "If your looking for the a way into a career in the entertainment field fast and from the best, and willing to pump out quality work just as well, then this is a great school. Professionals come into this school as guest speakers and teachers so students can learn the tips and tricks within the industry and give an edge to their education. Those who will live and breathe their education will succeed here.",
            "There is a grade system that is being used at this school called the Global Professional Standard (GPS). This displays to potential employers your attitude and your ability to work professionally. Ways to keep this score high is your timeliness, good behavior during class, participating during guest speaker presentations, and assisting in the community. The higher your score, the better chance to land a job out of school.",
            "Add in the costs of the whole 2 years it takes to receive a degree (tuition, books, living expenses, food, bills, travel expenses, etc), it is cheaper than attending a 4 year college in my opinion. The school is set up to get in, get out, and get a real job in half the time. This also makes the incurred interest on loans less of a burden since you get out of school faster. The drawback of this however is there is little to no time to commit to a part-time job and a full-time student. It is wise to prepare your finances for all your college years before committing to this dedication.",
            "First of all. You live in Orlando, a tourist attraction is all over the city. But for nearby sites, there is a comic book shop, card game shop, GameStop, an on-campus game club, and an on-campus library with movies and video games. I unfortunately don't have time for these options because of my commitment to this school. The alternative however is the students are just as geeky as the next student, and will talk about the next movie or video game that is coming out because that is our field of work.",
            "Full Sail provides 4 areas on-campus to provide food and coffee to their students along with vending machines in every other building. There's also a Wendy's, Chick-fil-a, Dunkin Donuts, McDonalds, Firehouse Subs, Crispers, and Chinese food within walking distance for a quick meal. But if you're like me and live cheaply, there's a Cosco, Target, and Wal-Mart for your grocery needs. Granted it is not the healthiest choices, and there's not a whole lot of time to cook a good meal each day, but you do have fast food options.",
            "Full Sail has no dorms, but has specials and discounts for many of the apartment complex within a 5 mile radius of school. I live 15 minutes away from campus in walking distance, share a furnished apartment with one roommate, and my utilities are included in my rent, making it the cheapest place near campus to live.",
            "If you take the regular accelerated programs, you will be at school 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week. That doesn't count homework and researching outside school time. You will lose sleep. I get anywhere from 3-7 hours of sleep per day and have gone up to 36 hours before sleeping. And when you graduate, the industry will be just the same. I am aware of this and challenge the schedule on a daily basis, which led me to my current 3.5 GPA.",
            "Full Sail is a challenge not to taken lightly. If you are committed to do whatever it takes to get a job in this industry, you will max out your capabilities to get the work done, lose sleep, and do your best in every class. You get out what you put in, and the student willing to succeed at all costs can make it into the industry, not just the best student.",
            "The classes are just what I am looking for in the career I want. The teachers worked in the industry, and now teach their students tips and tricks on what the industry is looking for in professional, entry-level, graduates. When you are done with your degree, you also leave with a prepared resume, website, and demo reel to get you in, out, and ready for the industry in less than 2 years with a bachelor's degree in the entertainment field."

I put my papers in on August 27th 2013 and my final due date is September 9th., 489996=May be better for students who are on campus., 179772=I started attending Full Sail online in August then transferred to on-campus class this November passed. I must say I am learning a lot these past couple months here. I had high expectations for Full Sail University and so far . . . they have met them., 15547=Full Sail has a number of clubs and will stress networking over and over (honestly, you'll hear the word networking like it's nobody's business). The Male to Female ratio at this school is 9:1 (yeah, seriously) so one I might suggest for the ladies is the X factor - a group for the women at full sail., 448597=Currently I am taking my courses online through the hybrid program but I will be on Campus for 2013 but from what I've seen the area is ideal., 468731=Well I haven't actually been to Full Sail University yet, I have a tour date on July 15th and a hotel booked for the 14th so I can tour the school and my apartment, and find a job to help pay for everything. But from reading online reviews about Full Sail it is a great school and helps a plethora of people to succeed. I know that I will be successful once I graduate from this school., 1137240=Don't take out any private loans if you don't have to. Take out federal student loans only. But if you can win scholarships and grants, that would be the preferred method to pay for school. Full Sail has professionalism points that apply to both online and offline courses. Everything you write in assignments, discussion posts, and emails-- all of it should be written in a professional, respectful tone. Spelling and grammar counts as part of this as well. Also, if you're taking an accelerated course online, note that this will probably take up 20-40 hours a week, as there is a lot of reading to do on top of research for assignments., 22860=Full Sail is an amazing school that will offer you the finest education for the industry that money can buy (and you will be spending a lot of it). You get out what you're willing to put in, all the resources are there from one on one assistance to the latest equipment and awesome facilities. A note for any girls just so you're aware, Full Sail's Male to Female ratio is 9:1 - we're a rare species here., 754648=There are always activities done throughout the community that Full Sail puts together at different times of the year. There was one back in October of 2012 dealing with I think it was called Breast Cancer awareness, the walk in Lake Eola. Also the different clubs just to name a few Entertainment Networking Society, Creative Student Networking Group, Music Publishing Society, The Record Club and so much more., 298216=A word to the wise. If you are not sure about the field that you may be interested in, don't panic. Full Sail gives you the option of changing your majors with ease. A new semester starts every month, so if you do change your mind you don't have to wait until August to start your new major., 293369=Campus safety can be something of an issue if a student is not well prepared. Such as, with a flash light or a pair of running shoes. Full Sail has classes that go on 24 hours a day. Considering that every student is carrying a $2000 laptop. Not to worry though. The campus security is easily accesible and they're available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. They do a great job monitoring the school and its surroundings making sure that students and faculty are safe during all hours of the day everyday., 529430=Although I have not had the chance to attend courses yet, the college looks spectacular. Full Sail seems to be exactly what I'm looking for plus more! I can't wait to start classes in August., 956126=Awesome school for the money. Yes it is a little more than some comparable schools, but what is included to help students with the amount of money that is needed in this school is better than any other school I have ever seen. Added to my tuition was a brand new MacBook Pro and supplemental software that is needed for the class. My package alone was a $6000 computer and software added into my tuition for only $2900. Some classes for example Mobile Development includes new MacBook, iPad and an Android phone for testing and development of mobile apps. Others may include cameras needed for the class also. The software given is awesome too with full versions of Microsoft Office for MAC and the Adobe Creative Suite Master Edition. My business class also included QuickBooks for Business. I am extremely happy with the cost of tuition., 693536=What is the Tuition for your in-State? Also What is the on campus hospitality? And May I be Able to research in a library of great size?, 444359=Full Sail University is an awesome university. I've been studying there since November 2011, and I haven't had any problems since I have been going there. Once I graduate with my first degree, I plan on returning., 765177=This school is quite expensive. I currently owe a loan that I cannot afford. It is due on February 4, 2013. I have currently no money to help pay it off. The money and the cost is well worth going to school here.}",

Tips for prospective students Make sure you aren't a procrastinator - once a week you are assigned about 15 assignments and you have one week to complete on your own time. Bang for the buck Definitely worth the cash - they send you a brand new MacBook Pro as well as all of the programs your degree will be needing. And I mean ALL of them. Am enjoying being here The only hard thing about the school is sometimes getting ahold of some teachers. Am learning a lot I currently am enrolled online in the graphic",
