            "ETSU is a very safe campus and has a very good warning system in the event of any danger. Unfortunately, every year there are at least a couple of dangerous things happening on or around campus but within minutes public safety sends out an alert via the speaker system set up around campus as well as through text to everyone's phone that is connected to the system.",
            "The presence of greek life is very small at ETSU.",
            "There are many clubs that allow students to get involved in either politics or the community. If you really want to get those volunteer hours in and make an impact then there will definitely be an organization in place that will help you do just that.",
            "I would say that ETSU is a college for people that really want to get things done. While there are parties every now and then this isn't a party college. The lack of sports also means that the people here aren't going to be going out every weekend to just have a good time. Also, the presence of the medical college across the street means that a lot of the students at ETSU are also in pre-medicine programs.",
            "ETSU is located right at the base of a national park and is therefore a great place to go for anyone that enjoys camping, hiking, or exploring the wilderness. There are many trails back in the woods behind campus that students can explore or use for exercise as well. Otherwise, there are many fantastic places to eat around campus as well as clubs and bars that are popular with students.",
            "The dining service at ETSU is pricey but very convenient and worth it if you live in one of the dorms. ETSU offers a full buffet from breakfast to dinner that has many different options. The food isn't always top notch but at least you won't go hungry.",
            "The dorms at ETSU poorly manages and many don't have air conditioning. There is a department that focuses on coming up with things for people that live on campus to do during breaks but these events are few and far between. If you want to pick what university you go to based on dorm life then ETSU isn't where you should go.",
            "Many courses at ETSU are simple while others are very difficult. As a science major I can say that the science courses here are tough and require a lot of effort to succeed in. If you want to be a success here you must put the effort in.",
            "If you're planning to attend ETSU then be prepared to get your head in the game. This isn't the college you go to just to party and have a good time. This is a university you go to if you want to get stuff done and get your life headed on the right path. The work isn't the easiest and the atmosphere doesn't lend towards partying. Just be prepared to get to work and keep that work ethic up.",
            "I think ETSU is a fantastic university that has many options for all sorts of students. The campus is beautiful and full of life and the people are friendly and diverse. However, the lack of a football program can sometimes lead to the lack of school pride which may be a drawback to some."

The newest edition to ETSU campus is the disk golf course they added this past 2011-2012 school year., 368155=I look forward to my visit at ETSU in December.

There are some scholarships you can only apply for before your first year at ETSU., 367337=Touring in December, 184138=Familiarize yourself with a map of the campus. Get things done early to avoid lines. Parking is hardest to come by in the first couple of weeks, so arrive early, or pick classes later in the afternoon. A parking garage is being added (2012-ish), so parking may get better., 367642=Touring in December, 402926=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
