There currently is a EFL (with elementary) dialer, messages and contacts application programmed in C. As of November 9th, 2008, there is no stable release of this distribution yet, as the SHR team doesn't feel it to be good enough. You can find images though on the SHR buildhost., 15267=Openmoko distributions are designed to run on various mobile devices, with the primary aim of supporting Openmoko Inc.'s Neo 1973 and Neo FreeRunner phones. They are GNU/Linux distributions -- complete operating systems including user applications. You can install any of them on your phone or even have a dualboot system with two distributions installed.

Some have modules compiled in, others have modules compiled separately. If compiled separately, modules can be distributed in the same package file as the kernel or separately. The bootloader. Theoretically, any version of uboot could be used with any distribution. In the future Qi will replace uboot. The bootsplash screen image. This is purely decorative. Generally, distributions can differ on one or more of the following components: Features by distribution/release target mySTEP by Openmoko distributor Golden Delicious Computers is based on GNUstep and brings a Objective-C API to the Neo.
