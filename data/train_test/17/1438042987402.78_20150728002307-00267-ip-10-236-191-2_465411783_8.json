    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{19286=It has been discovered that the selectivity of cellulose and cellulosic membranes (e.g. cellulose esters, cellulose ethers and mixed cellulose ether-ester membranes) under reverse osmosis conditions can be improved by repeated drying, rewetting in water, and drying of the membrane. This improvement is much greater than that observed after a single drying cycle. While the repeated drying-rewetting cycles are expected to benefit both cellulose and cellulosic membranes, the preferred membranes for treatment in accordance with this invention are the cellulose membranes. It is preferred that at least 2 drying and rewetting cycles be used. Drying is conducted at a temperature in the range 5\ufffd to 125\ufffd C., preferably 80\ufffd to 100\ufffd C., for from less than 1 hour to 100 hours, preferably 20 to 40 hours. The membranes are dried by placing them in dry, flowing nitrogen. Other dry gases can also be used. The relative humidity of the gases should preferably be less than about 25%. Rewetting is conducted by immersing in or otherwise contacting the drying membrane with water or any substantially (i.e. >50%) aqueous system at 5\ufffd to 100\ufffd C., preferably 20\ufffd to 40\ufffd C. for from 2 to 264 hours, preferably 24 to 48 hours. Following the last rewetting the membrane is dried and then used under reverse osmosis conditions. Reverse osmosis conditions constitute operating at a pressure sufficient to overcome the osmotic pressure of the component one seeks to permeate. Typical reverse osmosis pressures range up to 1000 psig, preferably between 100 to 800 psig, most preferably 200 to 600 psig., 20894=In a particular application, the pretreated membrane is used to separate extraction solvent from raffinate or extract oil under reverse osmosis conditions. In such a process oil is contacted with an extraction solvent such as furfural, phenol, NMP etc. to selectively remove aromatics from the oil producing a raffinate of low aromatic content and an extract of high aromatic content. Both the raffinate and extract, however, contain extraction solvent. The extraction solvent is recovered by contacting the raffinate or extract stream with the cellulose membrane at a temperature in the range of 20\ufffd C. to 110\ufffd C. and at an applied pressure sufficient to overcome the osmotic pressure, about 400 to 1000 psig. The extraction solvent preferably permeates through the membrane and is recycled to the extraction process. When used in this particular service, special adhesives and permeates and retentate spacers are required to produce the spiral wound elements typically used. These aspects of spiral wound element construction for extraction solvent recovery are disclosed and claimed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,582,726., 30641=Literature suggests that drying of cellulose membranes causes collapse of the internal structure by intra-chain hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl groups. This hydrogen bonding is irreversible and results in an tighter membrane. A membrane dried for 20 hours at 100\ufffd C. had a much improved oil rejection of 72% (versus 13%) with a lower flux of 104 l/m2 day (versus 1310 l/m2 day). Membranes dried at a lower temperature, had a lower rejection and a higher flux. However, increasing the drying time or raising the drying temperature beyond these conditions did not change the membrane performance significantly. Literature also suggests a limit to the degree of hydrogen bonding attainable by drying. It appeared that the maximum amount of hydrogen bonding had occurred., 23934=In order to effect dissolution of cellulose at room temperature (Macromolecules 1985,18,2394-2401), 40 grams of micro-crystalline cellulose (Baker TLC reagent catalog #1-1529) were soaked in 500 mls of deionixed water overnight. The water was decanted off and 400 mls of methanol was added to the wet cellulose. The methanol was decanted off and another 400 mls of methanol was added to the cellulose. This was decanted off and the above procedure was repeated an additional 2 times. This procedure displaced water from the cellulose and replaced it with methanol. After the decantation of the final addition of methanol, the above procedure was repeated 5 times with dimethylacetamide to displace all of the methanol from the cellulose. The final addition of dimethylacetamide was decanted from the cellulose and the wet powder was partially dried under nitrogen until the cellulose concentration in the wet powder was approximately 35%., 15683=The percent solute rejection exhibited by cellulose and cellulosic membranes under reverse osmosis conditions is improved by subjecting the water wet membranes, prior to use, to several cycles of drying, rewetting in water, and redrying. The water wet cellulose and cellulosic membranes are dried at about 5\ufffd to 125\ufffd C. and resoaked in water. Multiple cycles can be employed but at least 2 cycles are preferred. Rewetting times of about 2 to 264 hours, preferably about 24 to 48 hours are employed. Drying temperature of between 5\ufffd to 125\ufffd C., preferably 80\ufffd to 100\ufffd C. and drying times of less than 1 to 100 hours, preferably 20 to 40 hours are also employed. Following the last drying cycle, the membrane can be employed under reverse osmosis conditions, i.e. an applied pressure of about 400 to 1000 psig, preferably 400 to 600 psig for a variety of separations, including water/inorganic salts, water/organics, and organics/organics. The membrane finds particular utility for the recovery of extraction solvents such as N-methyl-pyrrolidone from extract and/or raffinate phases in extraction processes.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes The 4% cellulose solution required the addition of a fluorosurfactant to ensure complete wetting of the Teflon ultrafiltration membrane. This membrane was immediately precipitated into water after casting and was subjected to three drying cycles with 2 day soaks between each cycle. It exhibited an oil rejection of 82% and a flux of 166 l/m2 day. For the same rejection values, the fluxes exhibited by the membranes prepared from the 6 and 4% cellulose solutions are significantly higher than for the membranes prepared from the 8% cellulose solutions. Reducing the cellulose concentration in the casting solution increased the observed flux. As shown in Table 3, a membrane prepared from the 6% cellulose solution and subjected to 3 drying cycles of 20 hours at 100\ufffd C. and a 2 day water soak between each cycle had an oil rejection of 90% and a flux of 35 l/m2 day. This flux was slightly higher than the flux of 28 l/m2 day observed with the 8% cellulose membrane. The next membrane prepared from the 6% cellulose solution was not evaporated before being precipitated directly into room temperature water. After undergoing three drying cycles with 2 day soaks between each cycle, it had an oil rejection of 89% and a flux of 48 l/m2 day. Simplifying the casting procedure did not affect the final high rejection but did improve the flux significantly. Another important factor in the drying cycles",
