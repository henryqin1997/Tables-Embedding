It finally paid off in 2009, when he was chosen as a Test opener in the middle of the Ashes series. Many batsmen would have been uncomfortable with the promotion from the middle order, especially after failing when given the job with Queensland, but Watson has been used to re-inventing himself. In his first eight Tests in the new role he scored seven fifties and a 120. With a history of setbacks, it was not a surprise that his first Test century became such a drama, but after two scores in the 90s and an 89, he finally brought it up at the MCG - thanks to a single from a dropped catch. He has earned some luck., 100179=Since the beginning of 2012, Ian Bell averages 34.69 when batting in the top six; among regular top-order batsmen, only Shane Watson has a lower average, 18889=Born June 17, 1981, Ipswich, Queensland, 81606=Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year - 2002, 81920=Australian Twenty20 International Player of the Year - 2012, 2013, 80239=Jul 15, 2015, 78639=Jul 23, 2015, 79424=Jul 17, 2015, 96101=4391 runs after 35, and 2354 outside top five, 81681=Australian One-Day International Player of the Year - 2010,2011, 2012, 81783=Australian Test Player of the Year - 2011, 50458=At the crease he is an aggressive brute with a broad chest, a right-handed disciple of Matthew Hayden, and someone who often doesn't need to follow-through to gain a boundary. However, his drives and pulls are delivered in a much smoother style than his former Queensland team-mate, though that won't be much consolation to Bangladesh's bowlers, who were bludgeoned to the tune of a record-breaking 15 sixes in an ODI in April 2011.}",
