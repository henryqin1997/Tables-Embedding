Been to several shows and the song previews (especially Follow Me Down, Going To Hell, and Sweet Things) sound exactly as the band sounds live. Sweet Things may actually be even better live, but I'll wait for the record's release to judge. If you believe in Rock and Roll and await its new dawn, or if you love My Morning Jacket, Zeppelin and all the bands that are simply unique, at least give the title track a try. Or listen to 'Cold Blooded' off their Hit Me Like A Man EP. SO pumped for March 18., 133878=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc. All rights reserved.}",

    "textAfterTable": "15 Items Editors\u2019 Notes From its unambiguous title to its explicit cover photo to the naughty female moaning that opens its first track, Going to Hell has all the subtlety of a Harley roaring down Sunset Boulevard: this is lighter-waving heavy rock in the spirit of Guns N' Roses' Appetite for Destruction and Bon Jovi's Slippery When Wet. Actress-turned-singer Taylor Momsen reprises her role as the band's bad-to-the-bone frontwoman. On The Pretty Reckless' sophomore album, she snarls her way through cycles of glorious sinning and fingers-crossed repenting. Sonically, the album covers a lot of ground. The swaggering guitars of \"Absolution\" sound like something out of modern country's playbook; \"House on a Hill\" looks to Nickelback with its soaring balladry; \"Heaven Knows\" is a call-and-response rocker that evokes Joan Jett; \"Waiting for a Friend\" is a plaintive acoustic tune that's almost indie rock. Yet it's the barnburners that work best, especially \"Why'd You Bring a Shotgun to the Party.\" That's a splenetic rager that's sure to get the cops called if you play it at your next keg stand, which is surely the point.\u00a0 Customer Reviews Who cares about your religion?! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",
