Integral lens 60 can be manufactured with ring 30, preferably made of a reflecting material such as aluminum, formed within lens 60 or lens 60 can be shaped to fit around ring 30. FIGS. 21A-21C In the second embodiment shown in show three views of integral lens 60 and the defined cross-sections with no background. FIGS. 21A-21C in all respects except that the primary lens and the secondary lens are an integral lens 60. Integral lens 60 eliminates the need for optical matching gel between the primary and secondary lenses and the optical shortcomings which accompany interfaces between these two lenses. FIGS. 17-19C correlate with FIGS. 21A-21C show a second embodiment of the secondary lens into which is the primary lens is incorporated. FIGS. 21A-21C illustrates the relative intensity distribution, demonstrating that a very large percentage of the light emanating from apparatus 10 is redirected toward the preferential side by secondary lens 20 of apparatus 10 and only a small amount of trespass lighting on the non-preferential side.",
