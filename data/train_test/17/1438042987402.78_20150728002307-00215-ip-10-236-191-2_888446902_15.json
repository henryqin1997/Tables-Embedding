            "We have these weird-looking speakers with bright blue lights on top, and if you ever dont feel well about walking home at night, you press the speaker and a university police will escort you where you need to go. If you were partying, there's SafeRide, and they'll pick you up and take you to campus with no charge and no questions asked.",

            "There's a club for almost anything you can think of. There's even a Quiddich (spelling?) team from Harry Potter. If you want to make a club, you only need six friends to back you up. I'm involved in a modeling club, a Korean sword fighting class, and I swim at the Magg's pool to unwind.",

            "The dorm life is crazy! (Not party-wise) Parties happen off campus usually. But the people I've met in my dorm are just awesome. We're great friends and help each other with our work. My new friends take a lot of stress out of college.",
            "The work isn't horrible, but it's not easy... If you're planning on being a pre-nurse major, be prepared for a lot of work and minimal social life. Most of the teachers are understanding of deadlines if something comes up, like a family emergency.",
            "The university sends out their acceptance/decline letters REALLY late. I don't think I received mine till late May. If you don't hear anything, don't fret. Even if you're worried about your SAT scores or GPA, if you have a genuine and passionate essay on your application, You should be fine.",
            "One of the countries best-buy universities. (look it up, for real!) Contemporary university with an old-school feel. Always something new."

There is a tunnel underneath the main highway so you do not have to walk across it. Emergency lights everywhere, always feel safe., 220835=If you are an out of state student and your SAT's were under 1600, try applying test optional. I did and I got in just fine. Also check out the Fall Fusion program; I know multiple people who did that and it's also a good program that Salisbury offers., 2609=I will be entering my sophomore year this fall 2009. As a freshman I was nervous to finally be in college, I wasn't sure how it would be. The thought of just graduating high school and now having to grow up and be a college student was a big step. I entered my first class which was biology and it was a class of 90 students. Although it was a huge class, the teacher took the time to explain in depth every topic. If a student had a question, the teacher stopped and made sure everyone understood before he moved on. I ended up with a B in the class as well as a much broader knowledge for biology., 68111=The university sends out their acceptance/decline letters REALLY late. I don't think I received mine till late May. If you don't hear anything, don't fret. Even if you're worried about your SAT scores or GPA, if you have a genuine and passionate essay on your application, You should be fine., 316645=Jack Daniels wings and the chicken noodle soup are some of the best things here. We even had lobster night once. The only problem is on the weekends when breakfast is served until 3:15 and half of the dining hall is closed. Food is noticeably better on open house days, but is all around pretty decent., 33969=SU has a good selection of clubs, and always has a great array of programs and activities. Many activities are sponsored and organized by various clubs. For example, SU's annual Oktoberfest, organized by the German club, is the highlight of October., 336239=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here Salisbury University has been a dream come true for me. Attending SU was the best decision I have ever made. My parents had always believed I would stay in state, close to home for college due to financial reasons, but I had bigger dreams. I am paying for my education at Salisbury all alone, and am enjoying every moment spent here. I joined a sorority my second semester, and met many of my best friends throughout our experiences that semester. Everyday my parents tell me just how proud of me they are for going through with my dream, and being brave enough to take on such a huge debt alone, and begin a new life in a new state. The transition to Salisbury was hard at first, since I did not know a single person there. But through extra curricular activities, and being outgoing making friends was no problem at all. I would recommend Salisbury University to anyone who wants an amazing education, and the opportunities of a lifetime. Am learning a lot Salisbury classes are a decent size usually. My anatomy and physiology class was the biggest with over 120 students. It is a lot of students, but the teachers realize this, and take their time explaining topics, until every student understands the material. Teachers are always available during",
