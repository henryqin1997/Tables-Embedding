    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{327685=In the past year, there were a few reports of sexual assault on campus. All the students in fall 2013 received emails about the first report, but I'm not sure if the suspects were caught. That obviously does not make me feel safe. However, if you are scared to walk to your class in the evening (or any time), you can call the police station on campus and they can drive you to your classroom via their police golf cart., 64075=If you are an early bird, sign up for 7:30 or 8:30AM classes. You will be able to have your choice of parking spaces. If you wait until 9:30, it will be harder to find parking, and you will end up having to leave the house earlier to get to class on time anyways. Be to your classes (and ON TIME) on the first day. If you aren't you can and probably will be dropped (yes, even if your late they can drop you). If you are waitlisted, still go to class for that week, even if the teacher keeps telling you they aren't adding anyone. Many students don't show up the 1st day, or drop it after a few days, which bumps you up., 66021=There is a ton of school spirit when it comes to current events, fundraisers, clubs, etc. Right now we are having the Walk a Mile in her Shoes march, and almost everyone in my classes is signed up and attending it. The same thing happened for the March on March 4th at the capitol (supporting teachers and school funding)., 329301=On campus food is actually pretty delicious, but at peak lunch hours (11:30 - 1:30pm), there'll be really long lines at the food court. Whether you are on a diet or not, the salads are to die for. There's an \u00c2\u00a1UnaMas! and asian styled food stations if you're looking for some variety and it's located in between the food court and the dining hall. De Anza also has two coffee shops on campus, but I prefer the Le Cafe that's downstairs. It's quieter than the dining area and they supply multiple power strips. Off campus food can be easily be found across from De Anza. There's ToGo's, Quickly, Jamba Juice, Coffee Society, Panda Express, and Hawaiian BBQ. Again, at peak lunch hours, it can get really crowded. Be patient., 339197=Many students at De Anza are eager to learn. I have been to De Anza's on-campus tutoring during the summer quarter of 2014, and the students in my psychology class were very motivated to understand the material., 316822=This California campus located in the heart of Silicon Valley boasts an extremely diverse student population. It is the number one California Community College of 2013, and for good reasons too. Come check us out, and see why our motto is Just what you need!, 357297=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

There are many different people at De Anza, both traditional and non-traditional. There are online and night classes for full-time workers as well as classes starting as early as 7:30am for morning people like me. Many classes available so timing should not be a problem with those who work. Tips for prospective students Register early! It's important to register at 5am on your chosen registration date. I know it sounds early but it's really important because it can make the difference between getting a class or not. Make sure to check the availability of the classes you want ahead of time so when registration comes, you won't be freaked out about what class you will take if you can't get the one you want. Also, be sure to sign into the MyDeAnza portal to register",
