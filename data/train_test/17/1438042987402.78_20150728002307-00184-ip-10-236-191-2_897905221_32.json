The earlier your application is in and you make your deposit, the more housing options you have. If you qualify for honors or are interested in service, you can live on the honors or Ignatian floors. These two floors are in the freshman hall that was built in 2008. They are modern and very spacious. Another benefit is that they are air-conditioned. Another tip is if you have taken college classes in high school, send them to the college to see if they transfer. The more core requirements you can get out of the way, the faster you can start working on the classes that really count towards your major.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Not initially showing it's worth unless you can get most of it paid for. The higher classes may prove to make all of this worth it but the starting classes are sub-par in my opinion. The only class that put out as much information as you'd expect from a higher learning class was History of Modern Europe and, though I enjoyed the class, it's not applicable to most degrees. Am enjoying being here I don't believe I am a good view on the good points of the school, as I really didn't spend time on campus in my first year more than for my classes during the school year. What time I did spend there was very enjoyable, with many things to do in the evening. There are many places around campus to hang out with friends, a lot of events that happen every week, It's hard to find a day that there is nothing you can do. Am learning a lot Yes and no. Much of the 100 classes are review if you have taken high school level versions of the classes. You can cruise through with ease if you are motivated to learn and complete course work and home work.
