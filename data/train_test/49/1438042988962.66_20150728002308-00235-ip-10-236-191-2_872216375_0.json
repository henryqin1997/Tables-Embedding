    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{126482=Speed will not beat brains \u2013 but it is increasingly about teams having the balance of the two. Speaking of Zinedine Zidane, director of Real Madrid Jorge Valdano said the Frenchman\u2019s \u201cadvances are slow but his decisions are agile.\u201d What Valdano means is that, in a rapidly moving game, what set him apart\u00a0 was his speed of thought and execution. Indeed analysts at the German Sport University Cologne found that the essence of European football nowadays is speed: players are running more (an average of 10 kilometres, 6.2 miles per game) and the ball is circulating quicker therefore decisions need to be made in a snap (the deepest midfielder is typically in possession of the ball for an average of less than one second per contact). At particular moments of Hiddink\u2019s reign and in the second half of this season, Micheal Ballack has been preferred to the more cumbersome Jon Obi Mikel and indeed, German coach Joachim L\u00f6w will need to find a solution to his captain\u2019s efficient distribution following his injury. (The finding from the university helped shape L\u00f6w\u2019s Euro 2008 tactics and one such ploy was to force opposing wingers inside to the compact block \u2013 a tactic which is increasingly prevalent in Europe)., 123810=The changes in season 2009/10 had sought to make his side more dynamic which, while on the whole have worked, the degree of its effectiveness has been severely affected by injuries and inexperience hindering decision-making and tactical awareness so crucial to the system. In particular, the attacking momentum seemed to suffer with the loss of key forwards \u2013 chiefly Robin van Persie (although you can also put a big case forward for Nicklas Bendtner too)., 49515=United\u2019s changing face Losing to Barcelona in the 2009 Champions League final was to Sir Alex, the equivalent of defeat to Real Madrid at home in the Champions League quarter-final in 2000. United had just been crowned European champions the year previously on both\u00a0occasions\u00a0but the severity of the defeats meant the manager had to reconsider the way his side functions. \u201cWe had a spell after we won the Champions League in 1999 when we had to change our thinking,\u201d said Ferguson. \u201cWe lost to PSV and Anderlecht away and others on the counterattack.\u201d This season, not only have they lost Cristiano Ronaldo, out went fans favourite Carlos Tevez across the city, the two key\u00a0components\u00a0of their 2007/08 double winning side. Manchester United have churned out some pretty\u00a0uninspiring\u00a0performances thus far but their functionality means they are still in the hunt for most trophies., 126800=Theo Walcott does have his fans however with Brazil\u2019s World Cup winning captain in 1970, Carlos Alberto* picking out the winger-come-striker as the type of player who can offer his team a direct outlet to break from the compactness and short passing likely to be displayed by many teams in the World Cup., 111234=Bruno Demichelis, now at Chelsea, and his team pioneered the ground-breaking work at the fitness lab by analysing data to see how they can predict and therefore reduce injuries suffered by their players. Non-traumatic injuries have now decreased (that means muscle pulls etc.) to around 80-90% and are looking to identify structural problems in players by using\u00a0chiropractic techniques that may lead to injuries (Tomas Rosicky could benefit greatly from this). In 1996, Arsene Wenger revolutionised the club, from everything from the diet to the way they play, and seemingly the next step is to develop a fitness reasearch centre of their own to make Arsenal a truly modern superclub . \u201cThe first step to prevention is to analyse the problem and keep stats,\u201d says Jan Ekstrand, Head of UEFA\u2019s medical\u00a0committee. \u201cThe second is to evaluate the mechanisms behind injuries, the third to introduce preventive methods, and the fourth to evaluate these methods have worked.\u201d, 123339=Wenger sees van Persie in the Marco van Basten type mould, having seemingly revised his Dennis Bergkamp type comparisons only the season before. The statistics indicating to him was that van Persie was more suited to making quick decisions higher up the pitch rather than in the hole where he would\u00a0occasionally\u00a0take that split second longer, anticipating for the movement he essentially\u00a0should be at the end of. \u201cTechnical superiority can be measured,\u201d said Wenger in Total Youth Football Magazine in 2008. \u201cIf I know that the passing ability of a player is averaging 3.2 seconds to receive the ball and pass it, and suddenly he goes up to 4.5, I can say to him, \u2018Listen, you keep the ball too much, we need you to pass it quicker.\u2019 If he says \u2018no\u2019, I can say look at the last three games \u2013 2.9 seconds, 3.1, 3.2, 4.5. He\u2019ll say, \u2018People around me don\u2019t move so much!\u2019 But you have the statistics there to back you up, too.\u201d Former Arsenal midfielder, Stewart Robson is in agreement also:\u00a0\u201cThe key to Arsenal playing well, being penetrative and dynamic, is when players turn on the ball,\u201d says former Arsenal midfielder Stewart Robson. \u201cWhen they\u2019ve got their back to goal, suddenly they turn and look to play the next ball forward. Van Persie is brilliant is that, he can turn and run with the ball. He makes goals, he scores goals and with that left foot he is a constant threat.\u201d, 93472=The biggest problem is seemingly in the centre where teams, especially during December and January, where able to profit from the gaps in the centre. On paper, it looks like pushing Fabregas higher may have had an adverse impact on the balance. Yet, Barcelona, in their new variant of 4-3-3, whereby Guardiola has deployed Messi in an interior role similar to Fabregas indicates that is not necessarily the case. The difference comes in how rigidly Barcelona stick to their individual and collective assignments and press aggressively not just the ball carrier, but to\u00a0eliminate\u00a0all passing options completely. That means when the forward presses, he will continue all the way even if the ball is passed backwards while his\u00a0team-mates back him up by looking to get tight and at times, get in front of potential passing options. That tactic may in part explain why opponents are not so willing to go direct as confidently against Barcelona and of which enables the Barca defenders to be more assured in taking the risk to push up. Because it is true that, if teams go direct more quickly, as Inter did in their 3-1 win, Barcelona can be exposed from the ball over the top.\u00a0Indeed, Aston Villa, Burnley, Everton, Fulham and West Ham have displayed similar tactics against Arsenal, stopping the Gunners from passing the ball out from deep and profiting through gaps in the channels., 121680=In midfield,\u00a0Alex Song carries the same get-and-give efficiency that convinced Wenger to splash out on Gilberto Silva after the 2002 World Cup while love him or hate him, Abou Diaby\u2019s transition from defence to attack will be a key weapon in years to come. But much still depends on captain Cesc Fabregas\u2019 influence and whose tug of war with his heart-strings Arsenal must win. The notion that he will not get into the Barcelona side is wrong as there is not a more penetrative central midfielder in world football as Cesc Fabregas (although he is at the moment not Pep Guardiola\u2019s first choice recruit).}",

Chelsea at Stamford Bridge\u2026 Arsenal in contrast were unlikely to play any differently. Arsene Wenger went into the game wanting to control proceedings but found in front of him a sea of black shirts who were very committed in not opening the floodgates and letting Arsenal have the initiative. Dynamism on one hand has waned since their electric start to the season and the late flurry could not hide the defects. The best Wenger can hope his side can regroup and find that extra spark again. \u201cTransitions have become crucial,\u201d says Jose Mourinho, who always seeks to keep his side organised with five at the back in guard of such moments. \u201cWhen the opponent is organised defensively, it is very difficult to score. The moment the opponent loses the ball can be the time to exploit the opportunity of someone being out of position.\u201d That was the situation that was also posed to Arsenal; the",

We give the lowdown on the encounter. ______________________________________________________________________________ Which Manchester United will turn up? Some grumbles of discontent have begun to surface among fans recently of Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s continuous tinkering of his side \u2013 he has gone 105 consecutive matches now without picking the same team twice in a row\u00a0\u2013 and that unpredictability means it difficult to know what line-up the manager is to send out and in which system. The 4-4-2 has\u00a0garnered\u00a015 goals in the last four games it has been used although for the big games, Sir Alex has tended to favour the 4-5-1. And with strong performances against Chelsea and most recently Manchester City, the 4-5-1 seems the most likely choice away to Arsenal. United\u2019s changing face Losing to Barcelona in the 2009 Champions League final was to Sir Alex, the equivalent of defeat to Real Madrid at home in the",
