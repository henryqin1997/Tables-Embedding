Since the school and class sizes are small, you receive a lot of one-on-one action and the teachers make sure you know the material before moving on. I have learned so much that I bipassed in high school. The teachers teach subjects in a way that in interesting and attention grabbing. You will never get bored and will be excited to go to class the next time.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here If you are looking for adventure, you couldn't find a better place. The town is like one big close-knit community. There are two ski areas within an hour from here. Great views of the mountains that are all around us. Especially when they are covered with snow! The campus is really small, about a five minute walk to get to any class. There are about 2,700 kids and you get to know most of them, which I really like. Am learning a lot I love the classes I am taking this year. Everything is always interesting. The teachers always explain everything they are teaching. They have great teaching methods and great personalities. You can always relate to the teachers on a personal level and they are pretty much always available to help you whenever you need it.
