The ruling is upheld. Cost to Palmeiro at the time is $165,746 of his one-year contract with the Orioles for 2004 that paid him $4.15 million. The Orioles exercised an option for 2005 at $3 million. Palmeiro tested positive in May. His 3,000th hit occurred in Seattle (making him a 3,000/500 player) after he was aware of the results. The annoucement of his violation was delayed while awaiting the outcome of his grievence with Shym Das, the arbitor for substance abuse violations. Orioles cancel Aug. 14th ceremony to celebrate the 3,000 hit. Congress (Tom Davis) asks for, and gets steroid testing records on Palmeiro to determine if perjury has occurred in relationship to Palmeiro's testimony on March 17th in which he wagged a finger and said he never took steroids. Those documents arrive on Friday, 8/12/05., 38147=\u00df Piedra does not file a grievance. Cost to Piedra at the time is $4,600 of $84,280 minor-league salary.

Lawton does file a grievance. Began serving suspension at the beginning of the 2006 season. His appeal of the positive test was denied by baseball's arbitration panel and he'll serve his suspension at the start of the 2006 season. The date of the test was not announced. Lawton, who earned $7.75 million in 2005, and was not signed for the 2006 season and had filed for free agency., 90081=2006 < 2005, 26577=2006 < 2005, 42869=In 2005, the following were suspension lengths in the Minor Leagues: a first offense netted a player a 15-game suspension; a second offense a 30-game suspension; a third offense a 60-game suspension; a fourth offense one year, and a fifth offense got a player banned from professional baseball for life., 42293=\u03be Began serving suspension at beginning of 2006 season., 40319=\u220f Morse does file a grievance. The ruling is upheld. Morse claims that the result was due to steroids still being in his system from usage in 2003. The AP reports: \"Back in November 2003 when I was 21 years old, I made an enormous mistake in my life: I took steroids while in the minor leagues,'' Morse said. ``My thigh muscle, which I had previously torn, had never healed and I was scared that my career was over. I was desperate and made a terrible mistake which I deeply regret. In May 2004, I was punished and suspended, which I deserved, for my mistake. I embarrassed myself, my family and my team. I am responsible for the mistake of taking steroids and the positive result was not due to some over-the-counter supplement, protein shake or tainted test.'' Morse said the steroids, however, remained in his body and that he was again suspended in July 2004 while in the minors. He said those remnants resulted in another positive test this year, and he appealed those results. \"I am troubled that I will be suspended for the third time despite the fact that the scientific evidence supports that I kept my promise that I would never use steroids again,'' he said. ``Even the (arbitration) panel states in its written decision that 'the panel recognizes that this result may be viewed as unfair to Michael Morse.' I find it unfair that I am being punished three different times for making the mistake of taking steroids in the 2003 offseason. At least there is some solace in the fact that the scientific evidence supports that I kept my promise that I would never use steroids again,'' his statement said. \"This result is unfair and unfortunate. It punishes Michael Morse again for conduct for which he has already been punished,'' said Michael Weiner, the union's general counsel. \"The PA does not believe the parties ever intended for the Basic Agreement to compel such a harsh result.'' Das upheld the ruling after a grievance was filed., 39672=\u00a4 Franklin does file a grievance. The ruling is upheld. Cost to Franklin at the time is $147,540, based on his $2.7 million 2005 contract. Like Palmeiro, Franklin is informed of the positive test in May, as reported by Hal Bodley of USA Today, \"Franklin said he was first told of his positive test in May \u2014 and 'thought it was a joke' \u2014 then appealed and appeared before two arbitration committees. Franklin followed the same procedure used by Palmeiro after the positive test was determined. A grievance was filed on his behalf by the players union, but impartial arbitrator Shyam Das refused to reverse the test result.\", 27031=As of 2011, broken out by date; player; position; substance; MLB affiliated organization; whether the player was in the Dominican Summer League, Venezuelan Summer League, or playing for a North American minor league club, and; the number of games served in the suspension., 38294=\u00b1 Montero does file a grievance. The ruling is upheld. Cost to Montero at the time is $4,918 of $90,000 annual minor-league salary. Signed Nov. 19, 2004 with Texas. His major league contract calls for the league minimum on $316,000.
