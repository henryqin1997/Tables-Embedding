Our Take Western Union has taken a series of strategic growth steps. These include strengthening the consumer money transfer business, driving growth in customers and usage in Business Solutions and continuation of strong capital management. Although the strategic actions are expected to negatively affect the short-term results in 2013, it will position the company for long-term revenue and profitability growth in the current environment. These strategic actions will result in a return to revenue and profit growth beginning 2014. Though earnings will remain choppy in the near term, we remain confident of the long-term opportunities of the businesses of the company.
