Test polymers are cut into 6 mm diameter disks using a sterile biopsy punch with each sample prepared in triplicate. Replicates are transferred to individual wells of a 96-well format tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) tray and left overnight at room temeperature in a phosphate buffered saline solution containing 120 \u03bcg/ml penicillin and 200 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin. Cells are seeded onto each sample surface, including replicates on TCPS alone, at a density of 5\ufffd103 cells/well and cultured for seven days in a culture medium containing Dulbecco's Minimal Essential Medium/Ham's F12 (50:50 v/v) supplemented with foetal bovine serum (FBS at concentration of 20% (v/v)), 60 \u03bcg/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin and maintained at 37\ufffd C. in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. The culture medium is changed every second day. To determine the relative cell numbers present at day seven on each sample, the cells are incubated for 4 hours in a 0.5 mg/ml solution of MTT (a water soluble tetrazolium salt that is converted to a coloured, insoluble purple dye by dehydrogenase enzymes in living cells). The coloured end-product is solubilized with DMSO and absorbance values are measured on a plate reader (595 nm wavelength) and expressed as a percentage (\ufffds.d.) of the absorbance value obtained for cells grown on a standard positive control surface, which iss commercially-sourced polystrene which has been treated for use in tissue culture (TCPS)., 63280=The photochemical initiation of the monomer mixture using a photoinitiator such as Darocure 1173 (registered trademark of Ciba-Geigy AG) is the preferred polymerisation method., 38451=WO96/31548 discloses a class of materials based on perfluoroalkylpolyether macro-monomers, which in both their porous and non-porous forms can act as cell growth substrates and are suitable for use as biomaterials, particularly in ocular applications. WO96/31548 also discloses perfluoroalkylpolyether-containing compositions copolymerised with comonomers including minor amounts of dihydroperfluorooctyl acrylate. Although perfluoropolyethers as a general class of materials have many advantages, they suffer limitations in terms of cost and difficulty of purification. It would be useful if more readily available and simple monomers could be found with advantageous properties in terms of cell growth and/or being fabricated with porosity whilst maintaining clarity. We have now found that polymers and copolymers that are devoid of perfluoroalkylpolyether units but are based on free radically polymerisable monomers containing residues derived from fluorine containing alcohols and amines possess these properties and are particularly suitable as biomaterials, artificial cornea substrates and for use in other cell growth and membrane applications., 60721=The crosslinker is advantageously a low-molecular weight crosslinker having a weight average molecular weight of <1000, preferably of \u2266750 and more preferably of \u2266500., 84970=After demoulding, the resulting flat discs are extracted at room temperature in perfluorinated solvent (for example PF5060, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M) or Vertrel XF, Du Pont) for 24 hours, then placed in isopropyl acetate (IPAc) for 24 hours, then in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for 24 hours, then into ethanol for 24 hours, then into 75:25 ethanol/water for 24 hours, then into 50:50 ethanol/water for 24 hours, then into 25:75 ethanol/water for 24 hours, then into water for 24 hours, and then into fresh water for a further three hours., 91935=The compositions as outlined in table 2 below are placed in each case in a polypropylene flat mould (0.2 mm thick) and polymerised for 3 hours under irradiation from 365 nm UV lamps. The abbreviations in the Table have the following meaning: Darocur=Darocur\ufffd 1173 (photoinitiator Ciba-Geigy); DHPFOA=dihydroperfluorooctyl acrylate; DHPFEA=dihydroperfluoroethyl acrylate; DHPFBA=dihydroheptafluorobutyl acrylate; THPFOA=tetrahydroperfluorooctyl acrylate; EGDMA=ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate; EGDA=ethyleneglycol diacrylate; TEGDMA=tetraethyleneglycol dimethacrylate; TEGDA=tetraethyleneglycol diacrylate; HEMA=2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate; DMA=N,N-dimethylacrylamide; DMAEMA=N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate; AMPPS=3-[(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-propyl)dimethylamino]-propanesulfonate; Propanol=n-propanol; IPAc=isopropyl acetate; Zonyl FSN=Zonyl FSN 100 (non-ionic fluorinated surfactant [DuPont]); Zonyl FSN=Zonyl FSO 100 (non-ionic fluorinated surfactant [DuPont])., 143128=1,3-Propane sultone (2.0 g) is added to three dried samples of the material prepared in Example 5 swelled in a 50:50 solution of Vertrel XF/methanol (10 ml). The mixture is heated under reflux overnight. The modified samples are then extracted following the standard procedure outlined in Examples 2-11. The equilibrium water content (EWC) of the 3 samples is measured and found to be 32.1%\ufffd0.6%., 83417=A solution of freshly distilled acryloyl chloride (2.2 ml, 27.5 mmol) in trichlorotrifluoro-ethane (50 ml) is added dropwise to an ice-cooled solution of 1,1-dihydroperfluorooctan-1-ol (10.0 g, 25.0 mmol) and anhydrous triethylamine (4.2 ml, 30.0 mmol) in trichlorotrifluoroethane (100 ml). The mixture is stirred at 0\ufffd C. under an argon atmosphere for 3 h. The mixture is filtered and the residue is extracted with trichlorotrifluoroethane (3\ufffd30 ml). The combined filtrate is washed with an aqueous saturated solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate (50 ml) and with an aqueous saturated solution of sodium chloride (50 ml), and then dried over magnesium sulphate. The mixture is filtered and hydroquinone (200 mg) is added before the solvents are removed under reduced pressure at room temperature. Distillation at reduced pressure (b.p. 50\ufffd C./0.6 mmHg) give 1,1-dihydroperfluorooctyl acrylate (7.86 g, 70% yield, >92% purity) as a colourless oil. 1H n.m.r.
