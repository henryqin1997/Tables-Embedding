Data can be viewed in the Corpus of Family Names in the Netherlands See specifically De top 100 van de familienamen in Nederland (Dutch), 41273=Feminized names are included (m. Nov\u00e1k/f. Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1). Figures are from 2009 and provided by Czech Ministry of the Interior., 49392=Data from 2008.[15], 54279=The 20 most common surnames in the Faroe Islands as published in 2009 are shown below beside the number of people of the Faroese population sharing each surname.[16], 125414=The most recent complete count of surnames in the Netherlands is based on the September 2007 county registrations., 4708=The forty most common surnames in Austria as published in 2006 are shown below beside the approximate percentage of the Austrian population sharing each surname.[1], 167886=Those Russian surnames that end with -ov/-ev or -in/-yn are originally patronymic or metronymic genitive adjectivals with the meaning \"son of\" or \"daughter/wife of\" (the feminine is formed with the -a ending - Smirnova, Ivanova, etc.). In older documents such surnames were written with the word syn \"son\", for example, Ivanov syn \"John's son\" or Il'yin syn \"Elijah's son\"; the last word was later dropped. Such names are roughly equivalent to the English or Welsh surnames Richardson or Richards., 177643=Note: The most common surnames in Slovakia are a mixture of Indo-European and the Ugric roots reflecting the 900-year-long coexistence of the Indo-European Slovaks and speakers of other Indo-European languages with Ugric Hungarians and the Croatians, under Hungarian assimilation pressure throughout the 19th century (see Magyarization, see History of Slovakia). In 1910 Hungarians made up one-third of the population of present-territory of Slovakia.[47] Hungarians are currently an 8% minority[45] in Slovakia due to population exchanges and Slovakization.[48] (see Demographics of Slovakia). While ethnic Hungarians are relatively few in Slovakia, their large presence on the list of most common names reflects the intra-lingual frequency of the frequent names in Hungary., 19778=Belgium is a European nation composed of three main regions: Flemish Region (Flanders), Walloon Region (Wallonia), and Brussels-Capital Region. The Flemish region has a Dutch language tradition, while the Walloon region has a French language tradition. These different linguistic backgrounds are reflected in differing frequencies of surnames, as shown in the table below. (Data from 1 January 2008; total population: 10,666,866)[4][5], 187496=The top ten surnames cover about 20% of the population, with important geographical differences. The regional distribution of surnames within Spain was homogenized mostly through internal migrations, especially since 1950. Names typical of the old crown of Castile have become the most common all over the country. Most of the common Spanish surnames originating from Germanic first names were introduced in Spain during the fifth to seventh centuries by the Visigoths, so almost all are from the Visigoth tradition., 168584=The Russian equivalent of \"Smith, Jones, and Brown\" (that is, the generic most popular surnames) is Ivanov, Petrov, Sidorov, or \"Jones, Peters, and Isidores\", although Sidorov is now ranked only 66th.[42], 194646=Source:[50] - Data from December 1999.
