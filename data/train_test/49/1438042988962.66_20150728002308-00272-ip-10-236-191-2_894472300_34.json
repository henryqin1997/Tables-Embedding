            "This school is great for anyone who is artistic and is truly inspired to create unique work. It is great for artists who want to learn from fantastic professionals in the field who bring that experience to the class room. Great for artists who want personal attention in small class sizes and great outside e-mail communication.",
            "Columbia is fairly unorganized - so dealing with documents will be difficult a lot of the time, but after you are in the system they are a lot better at dealing with you. I also advise avoiding the dorms if at all possible. They are all pretty nice - I lived at Dwight Lofts which was really nice. It is however, EXTREMELY expensive. I recommend looking into other living situations in the city and other student housing places.",
            "It is an expensive private arts' college - that is probably the biggest issue most have while attending. Many of us (myself included) really can't afford it, but the school offers great opportunities for work and scholarships. Most people who stay after their first year are the folks who had a great experience who would say it's worth the money. So many people dropout during/after their first year due to economical/personal reasons. The creative people who stay and persevere - will all tell you this school is very much worth how much you have to pay for it. Even if it means a lot of debt - I feel I get to learn from the best and have great resources to use at Columbia.",
            "Living in downtown Chicago what is not to love? The campus is spread out downtown in various buildings. I find living in such a culturally exploding city like Chicago to be really artistically stimulating. Columbia is a place I have found real inspiration at. If you really enjoy doing art (in whatever specific craft/medium you possess) this school does their best to inspire and give you the room and freedom to express yourself in your own unique way. They advertise that - but I'm here to say I believe that is honestly true. They give you opportunities to express yourself creatively even within academic GE classes. Columbia is unique that way.",
            "I'm a music major and I have nothing but praise and great words about the faculty in the music department. This is no doubt a great institution to get a great music education from. What probably makes Columbia so special compared to other schools is that the professors are all currently working in their respective fields in addition to their jobs as educators. So they really can bring all their professional experience to the table. I also feel I really have access to my professors - every professor I've had is GREAT at getting right back to me via email when I have any questions. The class sizes are pretty small (20 or less in most situations) which is also really nice. I have attended Columbia for one year, going back for my second year, and just with one year of classes there I have already seen my musical knowledge and inspiration sky rocket after just two semesters."

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students This school is great for open minded individuals who love the arts and want to pursue a career in the art of your choosing. If you enjoy the fast life of the city and you enjoy the arts then this school is right for you! Tips for prospective students Definitely search for internships and other things to gain experience in your profession. This school wants you to get out there and make a name for yourself. Get out of your dorm room work hard and experience the city, the school, and just enjoy your time here. It is up to you if you want your name out there. Bang for the buck As for the education, you do really get the education you want for your money. The room and board is the only thing that is a bit expensive, but it is all understandable because of the campuses location being downtown. Those students who live on campus in the downtown loop are close to everything which makes it all worth it. Am enjoying being here I love being apart of Columbia. It is a wonderful place where beginning artists all around the world come to learn and hone their craft. The location",
