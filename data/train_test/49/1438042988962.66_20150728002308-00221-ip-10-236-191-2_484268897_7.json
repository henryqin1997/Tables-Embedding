No. 07/847,718, filed Mar. 6, 1992, entitled DEVICE FOR ASYMMETRICAL THERMAL THERAPY WITH HELICAL DIPOLE MICROWAVE ANTENNA, by E. Rudie et al., and Ser. No. 07/847,915, filed Mar. 6, 1992, entitled GAMMA MATCHED, HELICAL DIPOLE MICROWAVE ANTENNA, by E. Rudie., 44045=FIG. 6 is a graph which generally demonstrates a microwave thermal therapy procedure and a temperature distribution which was generated by catheter 28 of the present invention, with shaft 32 inserted into a Polyacrylamide gel formulation which simulates biological tissue. The formulation and preparation procedures for the Polyacrylamide gel are discussed in detail in D. Andreuccetti, M. Bini, A. Ignesti, R. Olmi, N. Rubino, and R. Vanni,Use of Polyacrylamide as a Tissue-Equivalent Material in the Microwave Range, 35 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING 275 (NO. 4, April 1988). FIG. 6 shows temperature measurements taken from eight temperature sensors. Four sensors were aligned at fixed distances adjacent first side 68. Sensor 1A was positioned immediately adjacent shaft 32; sensor 1B was positioned about 0.66 cm from shaft 32; sensor 1C was positioned about 1.33 cm from shaft 32; and sensor 1D was positioned about 2.0 cm from shaft 32.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. While the beneficial uses of the microwave antenna-containing catheter of the present invention have been described with respect to the urethra, other intracavitary applications are implied. RTC 174 transmits all closed-loop feedback to user interface 172, which processes the input and transmits corrections and instructions back to RTC174. RTC 174 interprets the instructions given to it by process control language received from user interface 172 and executes the instructions inreal time. All corrections from user interface 172 are made to maintain a given thermal profile throughout the transurethral thermal therapy. In addition, system 170 includes a hardware fail-safe circuit which shuts down system 170 should any parameter fall outside a given range of values. As shown in FIG. 9, control of microwave generating source 38 and cooling system 36 is effected by real time controller 174, which is in turn controlled by user interface 172. User interface 172 is an IBM compatible machine containing two hard drives for data storage: one for backup, and one for normal operation of system 170. User interface 172 communicates with RTC 174, which is responsible for all closed loop feedback to run system 170. RTC 174 has direct closed loop control of",
