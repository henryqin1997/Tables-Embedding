(albeit, this school's price can be quite staggering without a scholarship.) However, Westminster offers some financial perks: free local transportation, access to hundreds of databases that you would normally pay for, an exciting May Term, a writing lab, discounted ski passes, and other interesting things., 293077=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 158969=Westminster College is a school with a great reputation in the Salt Lake area that is an excellent choice for students that are active and/or those who seek more than lecture style classes from the start. Additionally, the school has pledged to be carbon neutral by 2030, which I happen to find amazing and admirable. This is a school with a lot to offer, with a prime location, small class sizes and knowledgable /helpful professors, what more could you want?}",

There are so many clubs that there is always a group for someone. Tips for prospective students If you are a student who needs more one on one attention from a teacher, and works well in smaller settings then Westminster is perfect for you. I suggest living on campus if you do decide to make Westminster your college of choice. It allowed me to meet new friends and have opportunities to just chill when I'm not studying. If you want a bigger school with frats and sororities then I suggest maybe the University of Utah but just know they will have very large class settings, and won't have the intimate feeling Westminster provides.
