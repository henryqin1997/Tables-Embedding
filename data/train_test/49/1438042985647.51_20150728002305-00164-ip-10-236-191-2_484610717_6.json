It has been possible to obtain these quite surprising results by systematically keeping the adsorbent cold by means of purified liquid nitrogen during the stages of stoppage of the device between the successive purification cycles, the cycles having been deliberately separated by periods of time longer than or equal to ten days. After five months of use without a regeneration stage, which corresponds approximately to a purification of about 700 tons of liquid nitrogen, analyses were carried out on samples of purified liquid nitrogen which were taken downstream of the reactor with the aid of specific and conventional analyzers which have detection thresholds at the ppb level. The results obtained show that the high purity liquid nitrogen thus obtained contains quantities of carbon monoxide and oxygen contaminants which are lower than one ppb. The adsorbent used, for its part, is a Hopcalite which allows a selective removal by adsorption of the oxygen and of the carbon monoxide which are present in the liquid nitrogen to be purified. The liquid nitrogen to be purified is produced off-site and then conveyed to the purification site by means of a lorry; the source of liquid nitrogen to",
