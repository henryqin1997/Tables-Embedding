            "The campus is very secure. Being a small school in a small town makes it a safe environment.",
            "There is no Greek life here, but there are many different clubs you can join.",
            "There are many clubs and activities you can do including a variety of sports to interested hobbies. If there is something that is not there you can always start a new club.",
            "People who want to be in a small classroom setting, yet be close enough to the great city of Philadelphia would fit right in. This school is great for all types of people including quiet people, party people, serious people, social people, and all types of groups you can fit into.",
            "The landmark of this campus is the majestic Grey Castle that was built in late 1800's. Administration and Student dorms reside inside the castle.",
            "There are usually activities that are scheduled by the school for your enjoyment on the weekends. If not you can always take a trip into town or even philly to fill your weekend.",
            "If your not sure what you are looking for but have an idea, this is the perfect place. There are so many possibilities at this school that you could get a little taste of everything.",
            "Arcadia University is a small school with a lot possibilities. It has everything from Physical Therapy to the Arts. The size of the school makes it easier with walking to your classroom, and getting to know your professor and your classmates."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{310700=Arcadia University is old. First year housing is packed because of the increase of class sizes. The bathrooms could definitely use some updating but they are currently installing elevators in the first year dorms for the 2015-16 academic year. The rooms are a decent size. I was in an overbooked triple my first year which means I was living with two other people in a room made for two. My roommates and I were able to all have our own spaces and get along well. The rooms come with a bed, closet, dresser, and desk for each student. Currently Kistler hall is the only resident hall with air conditioning but they are adding them to the other halls every summer. Air conditioners may be supplied if there is a medical condition. Upperclassmen dorms are much nicer., 105190=The food here is okay. There are three dining options on campus: The Dining Hall, The Chat, and the Easton Cafe. The Dining Hall is all-you-can-eat, which is nice, as well as twenty four hour access to breakfast (bagels, waffles, and cereal, with a gluten-free and lactose-free fridge area). You can also choose a take-out box option; fill the box as much as you want and eat elsewhere. The staff are very friendly. One of the downsides to the Dining Hall, however, are the hours. Currently the Dining Hall is only open from 10:30am to 7:00am if it's not a weekend. So if you want breakfast on a weekday before 10:30, you're forced to go to the Chat. The Chat is not all-you-can eat, and is very rigorous about what you can and cannot have on the university meal plan. Their meal plan selection is very limited. Lastly, the Easton Cafe has snacks, and does not accept the university meal plan at all. The meal plan is weekly based, and does not roll over (you lose swipes you don't use). All first years are required to be on the 14 Meal Plan, which is 14 meals a week which is sometimes too much and sometimes too little. It is especially wasteful when it is too much because you've already paid for those swipes and you can't use them after that week. Arcadia does offer plan-less swipes, where you can buy as may as you think you'll need. You can also charge to your Knight Card (your ID and meal plan swipe card) like a credit card. It has a limit of 1,000 dollars, but like a credit card, you have to pay that balance eventually., 208839=Each October there is a haunted castle tour. And yes we have a castle!, 315509=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students - NOT GOOD FOR PARTY ANIMALS...we participate in life at Arcadia. - Guys and lesbians...because there are mostly women at Arcadia. Otherwise dating can be troublesome. - Undeclared students, because they're great for helping you find your way and have a lot of class option with very helpful teachers. - Students that want to live ON-CAMPUS. I feel like off-campus students miss out a bit on activities and the independent experience. - Not perfect students...nobody is perfect, but if your GPA isn't golden, don't worry, because you'll learn to push yourself here without being completely overwhelmed. Good luck future Arcadians! Overall, this is fantastic school, and we can't wait to see you. Tips for prospective students - Do not bring all that stuff! You don't need it! If you forget anything there's a Walmart in walking distance (I reccomend going there instead of the bookstore or the Chat for food, because they're both expensive). But really, if in doubt, leave it out. - Get involved with your Advisor. Write down questions ahead of time. Do your research. Visit the career development center. Be honest with your Advisor. They can only help you help yourself. - Avoid alcohol and drugs. There's more to life. - Join clubs and volunteer on campus. Go to the events. You will make more friends and have more fun than just sitting in",
