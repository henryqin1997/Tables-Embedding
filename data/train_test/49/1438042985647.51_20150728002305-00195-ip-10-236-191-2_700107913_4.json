The trip into the Marine Park is short but exciting and also combines well with all the other activities on the island! After boarding, step down into the tunnel-like hull for a seat in front of the underwater windows. If you wish, you will be able to stay outside on the upper deck. As you reach the edge of the harbor you should be able to see some of the many green turtles that have chosen to lithe islands clean little harbor. Shortly thereafter, the vessel will pass over the wreck of the 50-foot island freighter \"Marignan\"\u009d, that sunk during hurricane \"Luis\"\u009d in 1995. Continue across the Saint Barth Marine Park and marvel at the lively underwater parade in front of you. Here, the sea bottom is full of colorful coral reefs that are gently invaded by troops of \"sergeant majors\"\u009d fish. Following this spectacle, it is time to head back to the pier. You may decide to stay outside on the upper deck from where you can enjoy views of the many beautiful yachts and breathtaking shores of Saint Barts. We hope you will join us on this fun and colorful adventure for all ages., 64347=Copyright 2001 - 2014 SeaDream Yacht Club. All rights reserved. Change Currency, 28648=On most days, a steady wind sweeps through the emerald dales on the north shore of St. Thomas to blow past beautiful vacation homes and over the scenic fairways and greens of the sometimes-infuriating Mahogany Run Golf Course. Major celebrities and several tourists simply love Mahogany Run. The course is a difficult but rewarding 18 holes of golf for anyone carousing through the British and US Virgin Islands. Bill Clinton played here back in January 1997. He left something of personal lament and signed an autograph of a photo of the course's most scenic hole, which is framed and hangs at the door to the pro shop. He wrote \"only\" got a four on No. 14 -- a bogey. Michael Jordan and several other professional athletes also gritted their teeth at the challenges of Mahogany Run. Actors John Travolta and Sylvester Stallone have played it. All of them came because the course designed by George and Tom Fazio has some incredibly scenery as well as some very interesting and difficult holes. SeaDream guests have the option to take the ferry or private water taxi from Cruz Bay, St. John to Red Hook, St. Thomas where a transfer van will whisk you to the North Shore to play one of the best courses in the Caribbean and some say the world!}",
