The methodology employs graphical properties of sub graphs projected on web graphs as input to the predictive models. At 1100, a set of search results are generated from a data store, such as the internet, based upon a query received from a user or system. Search results can include any object such as domains, web pages or URLs, images, videos, audio, documents, data structures and the like.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{146318=A number of program modules can be stored in the drives and RAM 1312, including an operating system 1330, one or more application programs 1332, other program modules 1334 and program data 1336. All or portions of the operating system, applications, modules, and/or data can also be cached in the RAM 1312. It is to be appreciated that the claimed subject matter can be implemented with various commercially available operating systems or combinations of operating systems., 147901=The computer 1302 can operate in a networked environment using logical connections via wired and/or wireless communications to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer(s) 1348. The remote computer(s) 1348 can be a workstation, a server computer, a router, a personal computer, portable computer, microprocessor-based entertainment appliance, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described relative to the computer 1302, although, for purposes of brevity, only a memory/storage device 1350 is illustrated. The logical connections depicted include wired/wireless connectivity to a local area network (LAN) 1352 and/or larger networks, e.g., a wide area network (WAN) 1354. Such LAN and WAN networking environments are commonplace in offices and companies, and facilitate enterprise-wide computer networks, such as intranets, all of which can connect to a global communications network, e.g., the Internet., 126189=At 1110, a prediction is generated related to the query or query results based upon the graphical properties of the sub graphs. In an aspect, a predictive model can be employed that has been trained based upon at least one of features of previous queries, graphical properties of sub graphs of previous query results, human or system judgments of previous query results, or observation of previous human or system query reformulations, or any combination thereof. The predictive model can include, but is not limited to, expert systems, case based reasoning, behavior based artificial intelligence, evolutionary computation, classifiers, a statistical model, a probabilistic model, a neural network, a decision tree, a hidden Markov model, a support vector machine, fuzzy logic, a Bayesian classifier, or any combination thereof. The prediction can relate, but is not limited, to the quality of the query results and query reformulations. The quality of the query results can be indicated by any appropriate ranking system, such as numerical, alpha, or alpha-numeric, rank ordered, ranges, classification, or by any other quantitative or qualitative measure. Query reformulation can relate, but is not limited, to whether a query reformulation will be more specialized or generalized, whether a related or completely different query is needed, if a query reformulation is needed, or predicting one or more query reformulations. Specialized meaning a narrowing of the query and generalized meaning a broadening of the query. The prediction can, but is not limited, to being stored, being presented to the user via a human sensory receptor, such as visually, aurally, or physically by an appropriate device, or being employed by an application locally or remotely., 150229=The computer 1302 is operable to communicate with any wireless devices or entities operatively disposed in wireless communication, e.g., a printer, scanner, desktop and/or portable computer, portable data assistant, communications satellite, any piece of equipment or location associated with a wirelessly detectable tag (e.g., a kiosk, news stand, restroom), and telephone. This includes at least Wi-Fi and Bluetooth\u2122 wireless technologies. Thus, the communication can be a predefined structure as with a conventional network or simply an ad hoc communication between at least two devices., 147564=A monitor 1344 or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus 1308 via an interface, such as a video adapter 1346. In addition to the monitor 1344, a computer typically includes other peripheral output devices (not shown), such as speakers, printers, etc., 158569=We considered a complete domain graph of the web from February 2006. The graph contains 39 million domain names and 720 million directed edges. The graph is densely connected, has a diameter of 4, and the largest component contains 99.9% of the nodes. Since this is a complete domain graph we have no problems with projection coverage. Basically, the domain of every search result in our dataset can be found in this graph., 148959=When used in a LAN networking environment, the computer 1302 is connected to the local network 1352 through a wired and/or wireless communication network interface or adapter 1356. The adaptor 1356 can facilitate wired or wireless communication to the LAN 1352, which can also include a wireless access point disposed thereon for communicating with the wireless adaptor 1356., 125137=At 1108, graphical properties describing the context sensitive projection sub graph and/or context sensitive connection sub graph are generated. Table 2 above provides some examples of possible graphical properties extracted from a context sensitive projection sub graph and context sensitive connection sub graph along with some features from the query. The features are grouped into four groups: Query features, F-Query, represent non-graphical properties of the results set; Context sensitive projection sub graph features, GF-PROJ, representing various aspects of the nodes and connectivity of the sub graph, Context sensitive connection sub graph features, GF-CONN, representing various aspects of nodes and connectivity of the sub graph, along with their relation to nodes of the context sensitive projection sub graph and connection nodes; and combination features, GF-COMB, representing combined features from the query, context sensitive projection sub graph, and context sensitive connection sub graph., 149409=When used in a WAN networking environment, the computer 1302 can include a modem 1358, or is connected to a communications server on the WAN 1354, or has other means for establishing communications over the WAN 1354, such as by way of the Internet. The modem 1358, which can be internal or external and a wired or wireless device, is connected to the system bus 1308 via the serial port interface 1342. In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the computer 1302, or portions thereof, can be stored in the remote memory/storage device 1350. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers can be used., 156179=URL graphs provide a representation of the web as a directed graph. Nodes represent web pages, and there is a directed edge from node u to node v if there is a hyperlink from webpage u to a webpage v. We created our web graph based on a sample of 22 million web pages from a crawl of the web performed in March 2006. We use a sample of the web considered to be of high quality. We started crawling from a seed set of popular, high quality web pages with good reputation. The graph contains 345 million edges and is well connected; the largest weakly connected component contains 21 million nodes, while the second largest has less than a thousand nodes. The strongly connected component is also large, containing 14 million nodes. The second largest component has 7000 nodes. The graph has diameter of 8, and node degrees follow a power-law distribution., 144362=The computer 1302 further includes an internal hard disk drive (HDD) 1314 (e.g., EIDE, SATA), which internal hard disk drive 1314 can also be configured for external use in a suitable chassis (not shown), a magnetic floppy disk drive (FDD) 1316, (e.g., to read from or write to a removable diskette 1318) and an optical disk drive 1320, (e.g., reading a CD-ROM disk 1322 or, to read from or write to other high capacity optical media such as the DVD). The hard disk drive 1314, magnetic disk drive 1316 and optical disk drive 1320 can be connected to the system bus 1308 by a hard disk drive interface 1324, a magnetic disk drive interface 1326 and an optical drive interface 1328, respectively. The interface 1324 for external drive implementations includes at least one or both of Universal Serial Bus (USB) and IEEE 1394 interface technologies. Other external drive connection technologies are within contemplation of the claimed subject matter., 153181=The system 1400 also includes one or more server(s) 1404. The server(s) 1404 can also be hardware and/or software (e.g., threads, processes, computing devices). The servers 1404 can house threads to perform transformations by employing the claimed subject matter, for example. One possible communication between a client 1402 and a server 1404 can be in the form of a data packet adapted to be transmitted between two or more computer processes. The data packet can include a cookie and/or associated contextual information, for example. The system 1400 includes a communication framework 1406 (e.g., a global communication network such as the Internet) that can be employed to facilitate communications between the client(s) 1402 and the server(s) 1404., 146866=A user can enter commands and information into the computer 1302 through one or more wired/wireless input devices, e.g., a keyboard 1338 and a pointing device, such as a mouse 1340. Other input devices (not shown) can include a microphone, an IR remote control, a joystick, a game pad, a stylus pen, touch screen, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit 1304 through an input device interface 1342 that is coupled to the system bus 1308, but can be connected by other interfaces, such as a parallel port, an IEEE 1394 serial port, a game port, a USB port, an IR interface, etc., 122957=Given the typical distance between search result objects, the context sensitive projection sub graph produced can include disconnected nodes that do not have any edges to other connected nodes in the sub graph. A connected node has at least one edge connecting it directly to another connected node in the sub graph. At 1106, sets of connected nodes are connected by identifying one or more nodes from the web graph that form a path between one set of connected nodes to another set of connected nodes of the context sensitive projection sub graph. In one aspect, nodes and edges that form a shortest path between a set of connected nodes and another set of connected nodes of the context sensitive projection sub graph are employed to produce a context sensitive connection sub graph. The shortest path can be determined by, but is not limited to, the number of nodes along the path. A connection node and edges are added to the sub graph for each node along the path from the web graph that was used to connect a set of connected nodes to another set of connected nodes. A set of connected nodes has connections amongst themselves, but does not have a connection to disconnected nodes or to other sets of connected nodes. Disconnected nodes are also connected to other nodes of the context sensitive projection sub graph by identifying one or more nodes from the web graph that form a path between a disconnected node and a connected node of the context sensitive projection sub graph. In one aspect, nodes and edges that form a shortest path between a disconnected node and a connected node of the context sensitive projection sub graph are employed to produce a context sensitive connection sub graph. The shortest path can be determined by, but is not limited to, the number of nodes along the path. A connection node and edges are added to the sub graph for each node along the path from the web graph that was used to connect a disconnected node to a connected node. When all disconnected nodes and sets of connected nodes have been connected by at least one edge, the resulting sub graph is a context sensitive connection sub graph., 154038=Communications can be facilitated via a wired (including optical fiber) and/or wireless technology. The client(s) 1402 are operatively connected to one or more client data store(s) 1408 that can be employed to store information local to the client(s) 1402 (e.g., cookie(s) and/or associated contextual information). Similarly, the server(s) 1404 are operatively connected to one or more server data store(s) 1410 that can be employed to store information local to the servers 1404., 145448=The drives and their associated computer-readable media provide nonvolatile storage of data, data structures, computer-executable instructions, and so forth. For the computer 1302, the drives and media accommodate the storage of any data in a suitable digital format. Although the description of computer-readable media above refers to a HDD, a removable magnetic diskette, and a removable optical media such as a CD or DVD, it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of media which are readable by a computer, such as zip drives, magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, cartridges, and the like, can also be used in the exemplary operating environment, and further, that any such media can contain computer-executable instructions for performing the methods of the disclosed and claimed subject matter., 143604=The system bus 1308 can be any of several types of bus structure that can further interconnect to a memory bus (with or without a memory controller), a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of commercially available bus architectures. The system memory 1306 includes read-only memory (ROM) 1310 and random access memory (RAM) 1312. A basic input/output system (BIOS) is stored in a non-volatile memory 1310 such as ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, which BIOS contains the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within the computer 1302, such as during start-up. The RAM 1312 can also include a high-speed RAM such as static RAM for caching data., 121397=At 1102, a web graph is constructed from all or part of the data in the data store. The web graph has nodes representing objects and edges representing links between objects, such as a hyperlink between two web pages. At 1104, search result objects resulting from the search are projected on the web graph to produce a context sensitive projection sub graph. The context sensitive projection sub graph has nodes representing objects containing search result objects that were found in the web graph and edges representing links between nodes. Due to the potentially dynamic nature of the data store, search results objects may not be in the web graph. For example, the internet is a dynamic data store with web pages and domains being added and deleted frequently. As such, a web graph that may have been produced prior or subsequent to a search may not contain search results from domains and web pages created after or before the web graph was produced. A search result object can be related to an object represented by a node in the web graph, for example, by a child relationship or a search result object can be the object represented by a node in the web graph. For example, each node of the web graph representing objects can be a single domain, while each search result object is a single web page. Each domain can be comprised of several web pages. In an another example, each node of the web graph representing objects can be a single web page, while each search result object is also a single web page.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets What has been described above includes examples of the disclosed and claimed subject matter. It is, of course, not possible to describe every conceivable combination of components and/or methodologies, but one of ordinary skill in the art may recognize that many further combinations and permutations are possible. Accordingly, the claimed subject matter is intended to embrace all such alterations, modifications and variations that fall within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. Furthermore, to the extent that the term \u201cincludes\u201d is used in either the detailed description or the claims, such term is intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term \u201ccomprising\u201d as \u201ccomprising\u201d is interpreted when employed as a transitional word in a claim. Our experimental results for two different problem domains demonstrate the potential of using contextual sub-graphs for search-related tasks. By using a rich set of graphical characteristics of search results (based on their projection in the larger web graph), we can predict the quality of results set quality and characteristics of user's query reformulations. This time the resulting model is simpler and more intuitive. We see that the maximum degree of a node in projection graph is the most important attribute. If the maximum degree is low, the query is likely to get specialized. This means that, if there is no central node in the projection graph, the user will specialize the query. On",
