            "WWU has a minimal number of crimes that take place. If a crime ever occurs, it's generally robbery at 3 am in the morning. During my time at WWU, I've never heard of anyone getting hurt. WWU has a system that texts emergency alerts at the time of crimes.",
            "Doesn't exist! This is awesome news depending on what type of person you are!",
            "Humans vs Zombies is quite the fun tradition. Even if you are not a part of the game, just watching dressed up people run around campus and throw socks at each other is entertaining on its own. As for locations, I'd say the library is quite interesting. It's like a labyrinth with nice hiding spots around every corner for you to either doze off in or study. Mostly doze off. There are funky reading spots in hidden areas which are generally kept a secret. Also, for the ladies, I'll tell you that there's a sleeping lounge in one of the bathrooms in the Environmental Studies building.",
            "There's just so much to do. WWU's award winning improv group Dead Parrots Society performs at the end of every week either for free or for a suggested $3 donation (or canned goods). WWU hosts concerts almost on a weekly basis as well. You can also join a semiannual nerf war Humans vs Zombies. If you want to get away from campus, there are several music venues, restaurants and clubs in downtown Bellingham or Fairhaven which is a bus ride away from wherever you may be. If you just want to get away from people in general, there are many parks you can visit, a state park with inspiring views just a couple miles south of WWU and Mt Baker east of WWU, which offers hundreds of camping and hiking options as well as skiing/mountain biking during the correct seasons.",
            "WWU has 3 dining halls and several little cafes and markets spread across campus. The dining halls are operated by students and a few full-time chefs. They offer a variety of gluten-free, vegetarian options for those who have restrictions. The markets offer hundreds of food options ranging from simple items like yogurts and fruits to whole meals such as soups & paninis and pizza combos. These places are student operated as well. Also, there are Freshens smoothie, Starbucks and Tony's Coffee stands across campus as well.",
            "WWU is known for not having a Greek style dorm. There's north campus, the Ridge, and south campus, when it comes to housing. Freshmen complain about being in the dorms before school starts, but eventually all of them end up enjoying their stay. Hall Council hosts a lot of fun and free events for students to gather and meet others while releasing stress from classes. Personally, this will be my third year in the dorms and I love it. Also, looking for housing off campus can just be a hassle. So many ads, phone calls and numbers to follow!",
            "WWU offers broad varieties of classes that can appeal to a great number of people. The 100-200 level classes are generally introductory classes that even someone who is not interested in the major can successfully attend for GUR credit. Professors are willing to help, as well as the academic advisers. They are also fun to just chat with, whenever they are not busy in their labs.",
            "Students coming up to WWU should not be fooled by the overcasting clouds. Even though there is rain much of the time, the springtime sunsets and snow-covered fields in the winter are to die for. WWU is perfect for students who want to get away from home, AND big cities. Bellingham is big enough to have a nightlife yet is small enough to not be overwhelming.",
            "WWU is set in a great location that appeals to a large audience. The university is surrounded by great city life. Dozens of coffee shops, cheap restaurants, local venues and thrift stores accompany one's budget quite well. WWU is also surrounded by Larrabee state park, numerous beaches, parks and a nearby mountain, Mt. Baker."

If you can think of a possible club that doesn't already exist, all it takes if 4 friends and a quick application., 695294=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 502302=Along with all of the activities and clubs constantly going on around campus, there are a ton of things to do around town. There is an area of town called Fairhaven where there are a ton of different little shops to go to as well as Boulevard Park to relax and goof off at. You can buy books, crafts, or even make your own piece of art at Creativity. In the downtown area, we have theaters (movies and plays), an imporv theater (where Ryan Stiles sometimes appears) and if you are 21 or over, this is where the bar an club scene is located. Also around town we have a mall where the discount movie theater is located, as well as the Value Village and Spirit Halloween store in October. There is also a location on Lake Watcom where you can rent Kayaks, sail boats, and wind surfers for really cheap., 362253=Apply early! Preferably before November 1st. Your application is like a place holder for housing. The earlier you submit it, the closer to the front you are in line for housing choices.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students While at Western, don't be afraid to try new things! There is an information fair each fall a couple of days before school starts and all the clubs and various student organizations turn out to connect to students and get people involved in the student community. If you love sports but find that you aren't exactly varsity material, give intramural sports a try! These are student run sports teams that compete against each other throughout their season, and there's even a tournament at the end of the season to decide the season's champion. The winner even gets The Shirt to show that he's won! Also, membership to the student rec center is included with tuition, so be sure to make the most out of that and try a class or two at the rec center. No matter your level of physical fitness, the rec center has something for everyone! Bang for the buck Having just finished my first year at Western, I can honestly say that my time there thus far has been well worth the price. I have absolutely loved living in Bellingham, and being a part of the Western community is a ton of fun! Not only are classes fun and engaging, but there is always something going on on campus. Advisors and professors make themselves easily available to students, and the campus",
