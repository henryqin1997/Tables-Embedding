    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{64503=I was in Vegas last week for March Madness and looked at the season MLB over-unders at Paris' sports-book. There was an interesting odds shift with the Nats, whose total was 89 but whose odds on the over went from -125 to -150 in a week (the latter being wager $150, win $100, collect $250). I thought that was a bit of an overadjustment at first, but the odds shift means the Nats went from a 55.6% break-even percentage at -125 to 60% at -150. Take two solid starters out of the rotation of your main rival with Beachy and Medlen going under the knife and that seems like a reasonable shift. The heaviest favorite on the board that I can recall was the Phillies to finish under 77 wins, but you had to lay -165 to do so. That's a 62.2 break-even percentage. The Orioles were also a sizable favorite (maybe -140) to go over 80, post-Cruz and Jimenez. Incidentally, pushes lose (meaning essentially that for the Nats' 89, you had to bet over 89.5 or under 88.5, though you could bet the push, which seems like a really atupid bet at about 5 to 1) and teams have to play all 162 games -- one rainout not made up by a bad team and your bet is off., 8293=March 27, 2014, 32485=+2500, 41087=+1000, 38084=+1600, 77649=Wynn/Encore has their own book as well and had some good lines. The +300 to push is a horrible sucker bet. Hitting an exact number of wins is about 6% or 15:1. Those bets should pay +1000 -- they'd get some action and still be profitable for the casino. The printed lines aren't worth much unless you can get the book to run the current odds from their system. Put a good bet and +105 and enough people jump on it that it's -120 in a couple days., 31977=+1200, 90440=Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 Baseball Prospectus, LLC. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Surprise Me!, 12857=As for the strong under play, it\u2019s once again going to be Atlanta. Fool me once, shame on the Nationals for underachieving in 2013. But with an over-under of 87.5 even after the injuries have taken their toll and a .500 PECOTA projection, it\u2019s the easiest Under play on the board., 37649=+1000}",

    "textBeforeTable": "You have to take slightly skewed odds on these (-125) in the direction we\u2019re betting them vs. (-105) the other way, but these are the ones with the best chance of hitting. As for the strong under play, it\u2019s once again going to be Atlanta. Fool me once, shame on the Nationals for underachieving in 2013. But with an over-under of 87.5 even after the injuries have taken their toll and a .500 PECOTA projection, it\u2019s the easiest Under play on the board. Already off to a 2-0 start, they get PECOTA\u2019s vote as the strongest bet on the over, given the output of our simulation system. I thought we might have missed our chance because of the lowercase \u201co\u201d opening day overseas, but Bovada, one of the leading online wagering sites, simply updated the Dodgers and Diamondbacks numbers and let the games go on. And speaking of the Dodgers, they\u2019re one of the teams that PECOTA is the most extreme on\u2014and in the positive direction, despite having the highest number on the Bovada board. So we\u2019re still solvent; it\u2019s just that I can\u2019t take PECOTA back to Las Vegas with me. I can\u2019t really explain why, but it was something in between the Riviera and the Rhino, and while the details are sort of fuzzy, when we got the request to revive PECOTA\u2019s best gambling bets, I thought it was best to do it from the comforts of home through the magic of offshore wagering.",
