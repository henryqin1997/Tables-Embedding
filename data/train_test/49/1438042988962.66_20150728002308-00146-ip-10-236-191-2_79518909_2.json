PA keeps exporting the measurements as long as the flow stays active. As a consequence, the collector might occasionally observe zero values for dynamic metrics such as the client/server bytes/packets. For all the UDP flows, the TCP related metrics such as ART metrics would be zero. Another note for the Input/Output interface metrics is that these are corresponding to the interface from which the flow enters/leaves the box. PA provides the basic metrics for both TCP and UDP protocols and for both IPv4 and IPv6. Some of the metrics are dynamically exported in the form of the delta value for the interval. These include the client/server bytes and packets metrics. In addition, PA server/client bytes/packets metrics are for layer-3 measurements and in a TCP flow are counted up to the second FIN. The rest of the metrics are relatively static and remain the same across different export intervals. PA Metrics option application-attribute flow exporter <my-exporter>  If you want to get more information regarding the various attributes of a particular application, you can configure the following option under the flow exporter:    option application-table flow exporter <my-exporter>  It is exported against FNF field ID 95. It is supported in both the export formats i.e. netflow-v9 and IPFIX. With this",
