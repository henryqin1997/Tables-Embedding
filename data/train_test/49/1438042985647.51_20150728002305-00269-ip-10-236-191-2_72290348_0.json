Note: JDeveloper displays grantable actions for Fusion web applications including actions for the Oracle WebCenter Framework. Oracle WebCenter Framework supports creating personalizable web pages. For details about securing WebCenter applications, see the For complete details about defining ADF security policies in Fusion web applications, see Chapter 30, \"Enabling ADF Security in a Fusion Web Application.\" Table C-1 shows the ADF components and their permission grants that you can define to create ADF security policies. You add grants to the policy store using the overview editor for ADF security policies. A permission grant specifies the fully qualified permission class name, the fully qualified resource name, the action that can be performed against the resource, and the application role target of the grant. When you enable ADF security to enforce permission checking, the operations supported by ADF components will be inaccessible to users who do not possess sufficient access rights as defined by grants to their application role.
