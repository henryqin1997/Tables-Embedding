After six years with KOAI, she returned to school, earning her Master of Arts in history from Northern Arizona University in 1981. Avery went on to get her PhD at NAU in 1983, specializing in American social and intellectual history. NAU promptly hired her in 1984 as an assistant professor and the Director for the Center of Colorado Plateau Studies. She earned tenure and promotion to associate professor in 1990, and gave up her role at the Center of Colorado Plateau Studies two years later. Avery became a full professor in 1998, and worked in that capacity until her retirement in 2005. She was married to Charles C. Avery in 1961, with whom she had four children before their divorce in 1986. In 1996 she married colleague and English professor Bryan Short. Avery died unexpectedly on April 7, 2006, in Flagstaff, Arizona.}",
