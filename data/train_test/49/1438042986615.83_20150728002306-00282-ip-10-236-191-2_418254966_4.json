He got his chance in the second one-day international and became the first Bangladeshi to score a fifty - off just 57 balls - on debut. His good form continued on the tour of Kenya that followed and he steered Bangladesh to victory in the first and third one-day internationals. He took his maiden five-wicket haul in ODIs, against Ireland in March 2008 but risked his international career by joining the rebel ICL the same year.
