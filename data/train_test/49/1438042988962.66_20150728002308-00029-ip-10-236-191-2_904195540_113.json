            "This campus is a very safe campus, they offer many different programs to help keep you as well as your belongings safe. The matador patrol can escort you to your car or dorm at night if you dont feel safe walking alone. You can also register your laptop or any other valuable item to you so if it is lost or stolen and found they can contact you. These are just a few of the precautions CSUN takes to ensure you are safe.",

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{136352=I highly recommend the dorms to the newly incoming freshmen so they can start many new people and have a great sense of community within the dorm life. Also there is events sponsors by the RA (Residental Advisor) with free movie screenings, ice cream parties, and even peer advisement. For exercise, their are volleyball nets, a small field for soccer, and basketball courts. The only downside is that the Matador Patrol closes the gates at 7:30 pm so if you need to enter to the dorms, you have to sign and verify with matador patrol before you enter., 1103142=As an Alumni, class of 2012, i really took advantage of all the opportunities that were offered to me in the School of Sociology. The professors are great and really allow you to learn skills that are practiced in the classroom so that you can immediately start using in the workforce. Professor Morgaine, Hatkoff, and Debose were my mentors, teachers, life coaches, and friends., 56915=I love CSUN,but if I were living on campus I would have a lot more fun.The sports are fun and it is easy to get involved with activities.The campus is beautiful and they are building a new Art center which is suppose to open in 2011.I also love the library because I always can find what I am looking for in there if I can't find it at my local library., 675507=I don't dorm, but I do live across the dorms, there is a curfew for getting inside without having to be checked in, they close the gates at 7:30. Also they are fairly overpriced, but I do still wish I dormed to meet new people., 235458=there are many fun events held at c.su.n. such as concerts by well known artists like b.o.b. and the cataracs, who performed in the fall semester, 2011. they recently built the student recreational center where students can become fit and active. best part it is free for students! during the hot weathers c.s.u.n. has a big pool where students can cool off., 75282=Great school. May not have the prestige of other schools like the UCs but it is one of the best CSUs in the state and has a great business program., 874348=I had no fun time. I tranferred in 2006 Fall semester from Mission College and I Graduated from CSUN in Spring 2008. My goal was to complete my BA as soon as possible because I was having a baby in Sep 2008. I had no time to see or do fun things at school... but study,go to class and take exams., 740882=I've been a student majoring in Civil Engineering here at Cal State Northridge since the Fall of 2007. I have seen the campus grow with student life and expand. CSUN has just finished building a new student recreation center, parking structures, updated technology in classrooms, and improved student life on campus. Overall I have enjoyed my years here and despite the large majority of peers commuting to and from, the student body can connect on campus. Go Matadors!, 714536=CSUN has an entire escort system that guards the library and personally approaches students to walk them either to their car or back to the dorms. Security guards have two shacks on the outskirts of Student Housing and patrol from 7:30 pm- 3:00 am. The guards are pretty cool, they actually like chatting with students and asking what's going on with them. They also patrol inside of Student Housing too., 597215=They are not acceptng new applicants until 2013., 739714=CSUN has updated their dormitory life since 2007 and provided better meals for on campus dining., 122576=This year 2012 the hired various security! Its really good., 987137=It`s no wonder than CSUN is ranked 68th in the 2013 edition of Best Colleges is Regional Universities (West) by US News. This school offers incredibly small class sizes which are ideal for getting the best of lecture time. CSUN`s vast variety of degree programs ensures than just about anyone can attend CSUN and study what he or she wishes.}",
