    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{32051=It's unfortunate that in some mountain biking circles, the phrase 'single-pivot' has become synonymous with 'unrefined' or even 'archaic.' This is nonsense. Single-pivot suspension designs such as the one found on the Occam 29 Hydro are still relevant, and often preferred, for good reason. When designed well, they're bombproof, lively, predictable, and -- when mated with a good shock -- easy to set up and tune. The Occam 29 Hydro's main pivot is located on the seat tube, above the bottom bracket. This neutral location strikes a superb balance between pedaling efficiency for climbs and sprints, and plushness for freewheeling descents. A 2013 Fox Float RP23 shock performs the squishing duties and yields 105mm of smooth rear-wheel travel.\u00a0 Adding to the Occam 29 Hydro's theme of sophisticated simplicity, this shock has a new CTD (climb, trail, descend) damper that makes adapting your tune to the terrain as easy as flicking a switch.}",
