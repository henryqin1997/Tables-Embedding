Tips for prospective students Be a serious student. You should have a strong academic record, leadership skills, and evidence that you are interested in the major you plan to pursue (ie - If you like business, have you done any internships in high school? If you are into computers, have you taken computer science and/or high level math courses?) At the same time, be well-rounded. Show that you have interests outside the classroom! Bang for the buck While it is an expensive institution to attend, the prestige and reputation hold true. CMU provides a strong background in any field, but it also provides a variety of diversity and experience that are invaluable and certainly prepare for life after college. Am enjoying being here",
