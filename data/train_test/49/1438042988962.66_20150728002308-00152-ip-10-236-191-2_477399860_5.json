No. 208,114, filed Jun. 17, 1988, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,879,484. This system comprises a stator having an output winding for producing an output voltage, a rotor within the stator, the rotor including first and second magnet rotors rotatable about a common axis and a mechanism for angular adjusting the first and second rotors relative to one another about the common axis. The angular adjustment of the rotors provides for rotation of each of the first and second rotors in opposite direction relative to the other for causing a relative angular adjustment of the rotors. Rotating each rotor simultaneously in opposite directions by half the required angle requires much less power to overcome inertia than rotating only one rotor the full angle. This simultaneous rotation of each of the rotors a like amount in opposite directions during a relative angular adjustment is accomplished using a common drive shaft extending along the common axis of the rotors for rotatably driving both the first and second rotors about the common axis. Left-and righthand helical ball splines are located between the driven shaft and the first and second rotors, respectively. Rotation of the first and second rotors in opposite directions relative to one another is accomplished by causing axial movement of the drive shaft along the common axis relative to the rotors. In that particular system, bearings are provided for rotatably supporting the rotors at essentially fixed locations along the common axis, and the drive shaft is permitted to move axially along the common axis relative to the rotors for angular adjustment of the rotors. However, the means for axially moving the drive shaft comprises a hydraulic drive means or an electric motor. In either case, the use of the oppositely directed helical ball splines together with the axial movement of the single drive shaft, reduces the friction required for angular adjustment of the rotors and thereby reduces the power necessary for accomplishing the adjustment.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While several embodiments have been shown and described, it will be clear to t hose skilled in this art given the above description that these embodiments are susceptible to changes and modifications without departing from the principles of the invention. For example, a rotary ballscrew comprises of threads 18' and 38' as illustrated respectively in FIGS. 2A and 4A may be used in place of the acme threads 18 and 38 of FIGS. 2 and 4. Therefore, it is not intended that the invention be limited to the details shown and described herein but rather that all such changes and modifications as fall within the scope of the appended claims be included. FIG. 5 illustrates another em of the present invention wherein the energy extracting member is a disc brake 50. It is also within the contemplation of the present invention also to use other types of brakes, such as air nozzles and clutches, in lieu of the generator on each ring gear 21, 26. An important criteria for such brakes, however, is that such brakes should be actuatable by extracting power from the actuator 10 rather than by an external power source. For example, one of the small generators associated with the ring gear 21 can be replaced by a coiled spiral spring 40 as shown in FIG. 4 (in which parts similar to the parts shown in FIG. 2 are designated by the same",
