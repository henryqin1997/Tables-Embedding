We ran into issues with some development tools, primarily the Flash Debugger for Visual Studio. Also, there was an issue installing SQL Server 2005 due to missing components of .NET Framework 3.5. We had to use a script to complete the install.

I was surprised that he said Windows 8 is more stable. I had not heard of any stability issues with Win 7. And getting faster performance with Win 8 also surprised me; I guess Microsoft has the code creep under control for once. Win 8 is supposedly designed to support a new kind of connected computing, and I wonder if your friend has plans for taking advantage of that.
