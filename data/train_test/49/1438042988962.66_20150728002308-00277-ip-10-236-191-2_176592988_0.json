Between these 10 REITs are roughly $17 billion worth of offerings (excluding dividend reinvestment.) In contrast, only five unlisted REITs registered in 2002 for a total of $1.9 billion., 23079=\u201cFor better or worse, private REITs have the advantage. People don't have to read in the paper every day that these things went up or down,\u201d remarked Dale Anne Reiss, Ernst & Young's global director of real estate, at the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) conference last November., 22573=Wells currently has the largest REIT in registration. Wells REIT II expects to raise more than $6 billion in 2004. \u201cWe've got our sights so focused on what we are doing that we aren't looking in the rearview mirror to see who's coming on,\u201d says Don Miller, chief real estate officer for Wells Real Estate Funds. Miller acknowledges that the challenge for unlisted REIT sponsors is finding the right distribution channels. Wells uses independent financial planners throughout the nation., 20426=Retail investors flooded the nation's four biggest sponsors of unlisted real estate investment trusts \u2014 also known as private REITs \u2014 with a whopping $6 billion in 2003. Roughly half that amount was raised by REIT sponsor Wells Real Estate Funds., 21862=But there's undoubtedly some jealousy involved. Unlisted REITs have shown a knack for raising billions by offering investors 6% to 8% yields. And a flurry of bad publicity that centered mainly on Wells has so far failed to slow down the stream of new unlisted offerings set to hit the market in 2004.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Jeffries doesn't think that the private REIT onslaught is over just yet. \u201cThere will definitely be more of these private REITs coming out this year.\u201d \u201cBut that probably won't happen, since the big wirehouses all got burned back in the 1980s for this stuff,\u201d says Spencer Jeffries, editor of the \u201cThe Partnership Spectrum,\u201d a monthly newsletter that tracks the limited partnership industry. It's unclear how Hines plans to market its new REIT. Like all unlisted REITs, which many believe are sold rather than bought, Hines will earmark millions of dollars to motivate its sales force. One observer believes it might be difficult for Hines to raise billions from retail investors, even if major wirehouses decide to sell shares of its REIT. Hudson-Wilson's concern about unlisted REITs diverting investor dollars away from their listed counterparts was echoed by others at the conference. One audience member suggested that NAREIT should do something about these unlisted REITs. In a follow-up call last month, Hudson-Wilson remarked, \u201cIf I were NAREIT, I would say that you must be publicly traded to be a member.\u201d A NAREIT spokesman says that no such plans were in the works. During the same conference, Susan Hudson-Wilson, founder and CEO of Property Portfolio Research, wondered aloud how the mainstream REIT industry can \u201cget in front\u201d of this capital wave. \u201cHow can the story be told that this is where the highest-quality assets in that category are?
