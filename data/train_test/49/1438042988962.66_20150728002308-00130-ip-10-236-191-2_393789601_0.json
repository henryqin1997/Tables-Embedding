    "textBeforeTable": "Typical values: The flicker factor represents a number expressing the flicker amount of the light source, or more precisely: the maximum-to-minimum ratio of the illuminance. It is independent of the average light power (the measured f-stop). A flicker factor of 0% represents an absolutely constant flicker-free light output, a flicker factor of 100% means, the light extinguishes entirely at its minimum. Flicker factor How strong a light source is flickering, depends on its inertia. Incandescent lamps react much slower to voltage changes than discharge lamps, and therefore show much less flicker effects. It is also important how the lamps are powered. Electronic ballasts supply the lamps in special way to reduce flicker. On the other hand does phase angle dimming increase flicker effects. In the last few years, the classical flicker problems caused by HMIs and fluorescent tubes had been taken a back seat, because most of them are now powered by electronic ballasts. But a new challenge has taken their place: LED lights. I will come back to this later. Influence of the light source Flicker effects occur when shooting on film as well as on video or digital. When shooting on video or digital, the recordings can be checked during the shoot and flicker problems can get noticed and solved in time (for example by choosing a different frame rate). But be careful: many digital cameras (including RED!) do not play back raw data but some meta data. To check the recordings you have to download them first",
    "textAfterTable": "The flicker factor of the light source can be measured by specialized meters, so-called \"flicker meters\". Usually they also measure the flicker frequency of the light. Contrary to flicker meters, frequency meters measure only the flicker frequency but not the flicker factor. To check a given light source for not causing any flicker problems for a specific shot, you always have to measure the frequency and the flicker factor. Generally, a flicker factor of 3% or less is considered as flicker-free for most applications, except high-speed photography with frame rates higher than 150 fps. You can test out the relation between the flicker factor and the flicker effect on the exposed footage for different frame rates with my Flicker Calculator. Flicker factor definition: E represents the light power (illuminance). Different lamp types HMI lamps HMIs are discharge lamps. When operated on magnetic ballasts, they flicker strongly (flicker factor between 40 and 70%). Nowadays they are usually operated on \"flicker-free\" electronic ballasts. Electronic ballasts transform the sine wave line voltage into square wave, so the arc extinguishes just for a very short moment during zero-crossing and stays constant during the rest of the period. But careful: the lights do never get absolutely flicker-free! During lifetime, the gap between the electrodes increases and the arc extinguishes for a longer period during zero-crossing, which can lead to flicker problems. Electronic ballasts",
