            "I don't think they have those here.",

            "Study and make sure you are attentive in class. Get to know your teachers! It really does make a difference. Like I said earlier, I loved mine and know that they are there to help me.",
            "From what I can see, the beach is about 20 to 30 minutes away, they have a bowling alley and skating rink and just about everything is on one street. There are bigger cities nearby like Mobile and Daphne.",
            "The day I went it was really good. But since I commute to school, I don't have a meal plan. The price to eat is about $7.00 but you can eat buffet style.",
            "I commute. But I hear the new dormitory is really nice.",
            "Wonderful teachers! Make sure you ask questions if you don't understand. Write them down while the teacher is teaching so you don't interrupt them (just a polite way of making sure the teacher stays on track) and feel free to ask them before or after class. Also, they post their phone number on your syllabus, so keep up with it in case you have questions. I also hear from some of my peers that some teachers do not announce midterm or final exam dates because they expect you to have kept and read your syllabus.",
            "STUDY! ABSOLUTELY no cheating or eyeballing during testing, and no cell phones, teachers really call students out on these!",
            "I enjoy the teachers I have here. They take time to explain, answer your questions, and assist you. I made excellent grades this semester and look forward to the Spring 2013 semester."

They made finding what I needed and getting accurate information VERY easy. The pictures I have seen of campus are beautiful, they offer my major of choice online, and so much more that benefits me greatly. I recommend this college to everybody!
