    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Multi-user timestamping can be summarized by identifying those portions of the timestamped information stream that are associated with a user. Then, for that user, the portions of the timestamped information stream can be represented by an image or the like and grouped according to event marker. This can be repeated for each user. It can be appreciated that this multi-user configuration is applicable whether the timestamp information is stored separately from the information stream, or incorporated into the information stream. Since the annotations are incorporated into the information stream, \u201cclock drift\u201d between the observer's clock and the data source clock can be avoided. There is no need to ensure synchronous time bases, since the annotations are incorporated into the information stream at the time of receipt of the timestamp. Indeed, the distinction between transmitter time value and data stream time value allows a user to mark a video stream much later than the time it was originally received. For example, a reviewer could mark events in a video years after the original recording date. The date and time is captured directly in the annotations, allowing a later analysis to determine exactly when annotations were added to the stream. This aspect of the invention facilitates \u201cnotarization\u201d of a real-time data source. The combination of encryption and un-guessable event markers (which can be facilitated by the use of two-dimensional barcodes to hold sufficiently large amounts",
