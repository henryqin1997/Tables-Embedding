And once you've enrolled at Stockton, remember to join at least one or two clubs, organizations, or sports teams. :), 81359=Stockton is a great college to attend if your not quite sure what direction your headed in. It will help you explore many areas of study and you'll have a great time doing so.

It is also a good business school. I would also recommend Stockton for anyone who doesn't want to enter a huge college. Stockton is on the small side, and is very comfortable. It has changed my life, and I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. Tips for prospective students I would definitely recommend on going to the SOAR program the weekend before school starts. I met three of my best friends during that program. I would also recommend going to all the activities they have during the first week of school. It really helps you feel more comfortable in your new surroundings. Take classes you think you will enjoy, but also take classes you've never really heard of. College is all about experiencing new things, and Stockton definitely gives every student that opportunity. Bang for the buck",
