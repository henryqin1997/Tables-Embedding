Additionally, the articulating grid 38 provides for a low profile of the side burner 30 when lid 36 is closed. As a result, the overall appearance of the gas grill 10 is symmetrical due to the thin, sleek look of the side burner 30 which mimics the side table 19 attached to the opposite side of the grill 10. When the user desires to close the lid 36, he or she may lift the cooking grid 38, if it is not hot, so that the feet 49 are lifted out of the shallow depressions 58 and then close the lid 36 where the feet 49 will then rest in deep depressions 54. Otherwise, if the grid 38 is hot, the user may rotate the lid 36 with sufficient force so that the feet 49 slide up the front walls 59 of the shallow depressions 58 and into the deep depressions 54 as the lid 36 is moved to its closed position. In this manner, the user need not touch the hot grid",
