            "Even though many young students going into college want to go to a bigger, well-known college, community college is the way to start. CCAC is a great place to begin financially, since the costs are way less than other colleges and universities. I also like that the classroom sizes are smaller, so the teacher can actually pay attention and help each student learn."

    "textAfterTable": "Did enjoy being here I attended the North Campus of CCAC for my classes and I loved it. The building is clean and open, the atmosphere was great for studying. They had a 2-story library with study carols in the second floor and computers on the first. There was a separate computer lab with free printing. The rooms are easy to find. Students also get discounts off of tickets for activities all around Pittsburgh including (but not limited to) Pirates Games, Phipps Conservatory, and the Zoo. I would usually stay on campus hours after my classes had ended either studying or just relaxing. Also, registering for classes was completely hassle-free. I loved CCAC overall. Did learn a lot I attended CCAC after a year at an expensive private 4-year college. If it was an option I would still be at CCAC. The Community College stereotype is one that needs to be re-written. The classes at CCAC were the exact same quality as anywhere else. The classes had challenge, the teachers cared, and I left feeling enriched. I took classes over the entire spectrum and I was happy with every one. I ended with all of my expectations fulfilled. I would suggest Community College to anyone and everyone.
