Lutein is an antioxidant in the carotenoid family (a group of naturally occurring fat-soluble pigments found in plants). Lutein is the primary carotenoid present in the central area of the retina called the macula. Lutein may act as a filter to protect the macula from potentially damaging forms of light. Consequently, lutein appears to be associated with protection from age-related macular degeneration (the leading cause of blindness in older adults). Where is it found? Spinach, kale, collard greens, romaine lettuce, leeks, peas, and egg yolks are good sources of lutein. Lutein has been used in connection with the following conditions (refer to the individual health concern for complete information):Macular degeneration and Cataracts.An herb is primarily supported by traditional use, or the herb or supllement has little scientific support and/or minimal health benefit. Who is likely to be deficient? While a deficiency has not been identified, people who eat more lutein-containing foods appear to be at lower risk of macular degeneration. One study found that adults with the highest dietary intake of lutein had a 57% decreased risk of macular degeneration compared with those people with the lowest intake, and of the carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin are most strongly associated with this protection. In a preliminary study, a similar link was suggested between low dietary lutein and increased risk of cataracts.",
