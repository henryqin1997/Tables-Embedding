The cart handle cover and entertainment center is of relatively simple fabrication and can be shipped flat and assembled on site to a shopping cart, as needed. In this application, the invention provides the child with a more sanitary environment and also provides the child with a form of amusement. In another application, the invention may be used simply to provide amusement. The invention is relatively inexpensive in either case. FIGS. 13-14 depict the handle cover attachment segments 40 and 42 as being located generally on the center outer sides of the bingo card entertainment center 62. Segments 40 and 42 although centrally positioned, operate in the same way as described above for FIGS. 9-12. This is yet another embodiment of the present invention and does not depart from the essential feature of the present invention. In FIGS. 13-15 is shown a third embodiment of the invention with an alternate entertainment center 62 in the form of a bingo card. The entire handle attachment segments 40 and 42 operate in the same way as depicted and described for FIGS. 9-12. An alternative embodiment is evidenced in that entertainment center 62 provides a top board",
