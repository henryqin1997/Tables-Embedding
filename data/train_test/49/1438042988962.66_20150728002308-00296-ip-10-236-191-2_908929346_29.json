Tips for prospective students Go in with lots of questions to make sure you get all of your concerns taken care of. They'll help you with everything. Bang for the buck I am personally paying higher tuition since I am out of county but it's STILL very affordable. You get so much free help from the staff it definitely makes every dollar worth it. They strive to help you succeed. Not to mention, the Jackson Campus now has an on-site clinic for walk-in sickies. It literally only costs a few dollars to get prescriptions. Beyond affordable! Am enjoying being here",
