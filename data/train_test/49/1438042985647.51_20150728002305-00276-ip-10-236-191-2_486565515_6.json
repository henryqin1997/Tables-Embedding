Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and applications shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be regarded as falling within the scope of the invention in the appended claims and their equivalents. Furthermore, the present invention assigns a plurality of sending nodes equally to a plurality of available routes. The present invention also assigns a plurality of user terminals that belong to a single sending node equally to a plurality of available routes, thereby allowing a limited number of routes to be effectively utilized. The above discussion will be summarized as follows. The present invention proposes various route selection algorithms and their combinations. One of those algorithms chooses a route that exhibits the best uniformity in terms of channel capacity from among a plurality of candidate routes. They also include some algorithms to choose a route that is less likely to be affected by packet traffic flowing into relaying nodes involved therein. The present invention further provides a route selection algorithm to choose a route that has a spare channel which exhibits the highest backup ratio. With those route selection algorithms and processes, the present invention allows more stable and reliable packet transmission. S111! The",
