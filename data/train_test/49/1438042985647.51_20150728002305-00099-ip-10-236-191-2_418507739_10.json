Safari untested. I downloaded Firefox and it looks much better. Basically firefox maps/converts the colours to your monitor profile so they look correct. If untagged, firefox assumes sRGB but also converts to your monitor profile. Internet explorer only assumes sRGB and displays them without accounting for your monitor profile or something like that.
