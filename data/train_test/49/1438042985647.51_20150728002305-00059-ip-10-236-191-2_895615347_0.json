The ideal conditions are sunny days with temperatures in the 50s followed by nights getting down into the 30s. The warmer days allow the sap to flow in the maple trees before slowing down in the evening. Temperature change can alter the length of tapping season and have a negative effect on Ohio\u0092s annual maple syrup harvest volume, like it did last year when the warm temperatures caused the season to start earlier., 37641=No one knows if the warm winter of 2012 was a one-time anomaly or part of a permanent warming cycle, but some Ohio maple syrup producers are watching closely because temperature changes can affect, 30315=The warm 2012 winter led to a decrease in the state\u0092s production from the previous year\u0092s 125,000 gallons to 100,000 gallons, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. But this year\u0092s number rose to 155,000 gallons as Ohio experienced a winter closer to the norm., 28155=LANCASTER \u2014 No one knows if the warm winter of 2012 was a one-time anomaly or part of a permanent warming cycle, but some Ohio maple syrup producers are watching closely because temperature changes can affect their annual yield., 32189=Nationally, maple syrup production increased 70 percent from last year to 3.25 million gallons this year and all maple syrup-producing states showed an increase in 2013 from 2012, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. The USDA credits that to cooler temperatures in the early spring, which provided for a longer season of tap flow. The season averaged 37 days, up from 24 days in 2012., 72526=Copyright \u00a9 2015 archive.chillicothegazette.com. All rights reserved.
