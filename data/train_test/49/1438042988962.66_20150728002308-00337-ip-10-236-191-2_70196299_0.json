The lot is located in downtown Karachi in a prestigious area developed by the British in the 19th century. Now considered a financial hub, the area is populated today with government buildings, financial institutions, foreign consulates, and the famous Sind Club, founded in 1871 as an elite European gentleman\u2019s club and designed in the Indo-Italianate style popular throughout the British Empire in the mid 19th century). Set back from Abdullah Haroon Road about 60 feet, the former Embassy stands across the road from the expansive Frere Park and Frere Hall, the town hall designed in the High Victorian Gothic style and erected in 1865 during the British Raj period (1858 \u2013 1947, the year of Pakistan\u2019s independence. The Hall was reopened in 2011 after a bomb attack on the Consulate in June 2002, the first of others that culminated in 2006 with a bombing that killed Pakistani and American diplomatic staff., 12356=Application for listing as a \u201cHeritage Building\u201d by a group of concerns citizens and architects affiliated with the IPA, Institute of Pakistani Architects, and others is underway. It was submitted in June 2012 to the Chief Secretary, Government of Sindh/ex-officio Chairman of the Heritage Advisory Committee., 30405=While visiting Karachi, Alexander discovered the \u201cready availability of cylindrical [metal] molds for casting concrete vault forms, and was determined to utilize such forms in an effort to counter what he believed to be Neutra\u2019s overly stark design of the main administration wing\u201d (Hines 245). Indeed, at first glance the composition suffers somewhat from how these disparate pieces of the complex are integrated, although its overall disposition is one of a fairly subtle weaving together of elements and functions. In any case, the conflicting ideas and goals of the two architects, each individually well established, proved insurmountable. Founded in 1949 and confined to large-scale projects, the partnership ended at about the time the Embassy and Cyclorama were completed., 32422=Embassies were also to respect local cultures. This paralleled Neutra\u2019s conviction that Modernism, especially his Modernism, could accomplish this through sensitive responses to the needs of all the users involved with a building. For example, he \u201cconceived of the outdoor area [below the cantilevered portion of the executive wing] as a prayer floor for the large number of Moslemic [stet] employees of the embassy, with an ablution pond and a fountain \u2026 Mr. Neutra felt it necessary to demonstrate visibly in his design the courtesy of his country to the staff of the Moslem faith and took it upon himself to discuss religious details with the Bar Mulvi, the highest church dignitary of West Pakistan.\u201d (South Africa Architectural Record) Neutra employed a similar approach with regard to user needs at the university laboratories and library at the Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh, East Pakistan, 1963., 33358=The concern for establishing an American identity abroad while respecting a host culture is virtually unchanged today. The following is a quote from the eleven Guiding Principles for \u201cConstructive Diplomacy: The US Department of State's Overseas Building Program,\u201d published May 2011 under Adam E. Namm, Acting Director, Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations, United States Department of State., 38449=Mulcahy, Frank. \u201cBuildings Show Design Influence of Southland.\u201d Los Angeles Times 23 Nov. 1958, 38170=Architectural Record, May 1955: 187., 39065=South Africa Architectural Record Vol 47, No 3-4, March April 1962., 38222=Arts and architecture, March 1953, 31., 28197=The property embodies the FBO\u2019s directive for embassies abroad, to assert American standards of design and technology while acknowledging local traditions. The primary and interstitial buildings of reinforced concrete reflect methodology standard for large-scale buildings engineered in the U.S. at the time of construction. Parker, Zehnder and Associates was a well-respected and published engineering practice and the \u201cgo-to\u201d firm for Neutra and Alexander; the engineers were simultaneously working on the firm\u2019s much more daring steel design for the Cyclorama Building at the Gettysburg National Military Park, completed in 1962 (American Steel Construction). White in appearance, it is not known whether the (peeling) white paint seen on the primary structure in recent photographs is original or if the building\u2019s concrete employed lighter tones integral to the mix. In contrast to the engineering of the primary and intermediate glass-and-concrete buildings, the warehouse was low-tech, with walls of an earthen-coloured concrete block with hollow clay tile infill used for the open arches. The block, tile, and terrazzo were locally procured and mixed on site. As Annabel Jane Wharton remarked in Building the Cold War, \u201cMaking the Modern abroad was, after all, not so easy. Indeed, the effort required in the realization of a monumental Modernity where none had previously existed was nothing short of heroic. Basic building materials were difficult to obtain in Europe after World War II; they were completely lacking in the Middle East\u201d (Wharton 7) Co-architect Robert Alexander \u201ccomplained loudly to the FBO that the concrete mix at Karachi was being watered down by the local contractor. He even warned of a possible building collapse (which fortunately never occurred), but he could do nothing to correct the problem because his firm had no contract to provide supervision and his complaints were dismissed.\u201d (Loeffler 145) Thus, within the period of significance based on its completion in 1961, the Embassy represents the attempt of the State Department to insert and to some extent integrate an American construction paradigm into the local Pakistan building and craft culture.}",
