Some people have used hdparm to change the HDD's power management, although I've never done that myself. I don't recall anyone reporting any benefit. Click to expand... Does anyone know if the hard drive option actually does anything? It can be set to \"bypass\", \"quiet\", and \"performance\". If this option does actually do something then it must be imperceptible because I can't tell a difference between the three. \u2191 Arkainium said: 531 Trophy",
