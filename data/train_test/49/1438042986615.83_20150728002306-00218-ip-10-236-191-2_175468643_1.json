    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{45581=Ditto what baseballswami said re the Espi-Lombo \"competition\" \u2014 assuming the Nats think of Lombo as competition Espi at 2nd base and not \"utility\". Could Espi be \"utility guy\"? I think not. Espi seems to have a rather large ego that screams 2nd base or, even better, SS, if it weren't taken. I'm not sayin' largeness of ego is necessarily a bad thing at this level, but I see Espi suffering a large dent in the pysche if he were labeled \"utility\". Apparently Lombo can cope with it. Davey has told Lombo more than once that he's not \"utility\"; he's full time. Right. I gotta confess I love watchin' Lombo's game for the reasons swami gave: baseball IQ and mental consistency; and there's a natural grace and fluidity to it. I like Espi, too. Great defender. Ferocious swing \u2014 and when he connects, he drives the ball impressively. But so far he hasn't connected often enough \u2014 not since the 2nd half of 2012 anyway. The Nats apparentlyl are hoping Espi improves his hitting on the job, like Desi did. They'll use Lombo as \"Mr. Utility\" in the meantime, but that doesn't seem fair to Lombo., 17204=Actually, I just looked it up. It tied the record for second most all-time. The record was 43 K's in a 20 inning game in 1971., 32532=Steady Eddie said\u2026 Wonk \u2014 along with his increased command, Det's unflappability in the face of errors and bad calls has been his biggest area of improvement since 2011.Add one more: his endurance, too.\"A well-located fastball is still the hardest pitch to hit in the big leagues,\" teammate Ryan Zimmerman said. \"I think some people forget that sometimes.\"That sort goes to the old saying that pitching has three components: speed, location, and movement, and you only need two of those three to pitch well. It seems, though, that Det had all three going, last night., 64158=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows.

According to this site, it activates if he starts 120 times this season or plays in 113 games (I guess starting from when he signed last season)? How many games has he played so far?Also, if the vesting option activates, does that mean he will definitively be with us in 2014, or does it just mean it's an option?So far I want this dude on our team until he retires!, 47382=NL \u2014 Of course, this timing is never that accurate in practice, but Queens forecast tomorrow night is for 30% chance of isolated t-storms until 10 pm where it becomes 60%, then 80% by 11 pm. So depends how quickly the front comes through and how efficiently pitched it is. Both of those hurlers at their best, we could have a 5-hitter net of both sides over by 9:15. Or an extra innings mess that gets finished Saturday night., 76466=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC. Images provided by Getty Images. Powered by WordPress.com VIP.}",
