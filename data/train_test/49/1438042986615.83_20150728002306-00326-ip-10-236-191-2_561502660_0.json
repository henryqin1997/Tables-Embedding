I do agree though that JJ is the better live performer. If I am a tour promotor I would rather choose Jimi as lead vocalist. But as a entertainer I think Jimi is far better than Dave. He can charm a large number of audience for a long time. ------------------------------- Susumu wrote: Date: October 18, 2000 10:15PM Kevin () Posted by: RE: Jamison vs Bickler, round 1",
