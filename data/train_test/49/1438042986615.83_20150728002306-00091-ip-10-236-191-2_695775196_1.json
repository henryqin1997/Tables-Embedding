But it was probably a decent contest in which MRS JORDAN finished third at Exeter earlier this month and she was doing her best work at the finish. With an extra quarter-mile to cover, she should be even more effective here. Molly's A Diva just hasn't taken to hurdles while Fine Moment and Leith Hill Legasi are both tackling obstacles for the first time.
