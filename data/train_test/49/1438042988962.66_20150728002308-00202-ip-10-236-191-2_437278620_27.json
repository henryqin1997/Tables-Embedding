            "TRANSGENIC NON-HUMAN ANIMAL AND METHODS FOR STEM CELL ENGRAFTMENT - Transgenic immunodeficient non-human animals according to embodiments of the present invention are described which include in their genome a nucleic acid encoding xenogeneic Stem Cell Factor operably linked to a promoter. Administration of xenogeneic hematopoetic stem cells to the inventive transgenic animals results in engraftment of the xenogeneic hematopoetic stem cells and xenogeneic leukocytes are produced in the animals, without conditioning such as without conditioning by irradiation and without conditioning by a radiomimetic agent.",
            "MOUSE HAVING HUMAN LEUKEMIC STEM CELL AND LEUKEMIC NON-STEM CELL AMPLIFIED THEREIN, AND METHOD FOR PRODUCTION THEREOF - The invention relates to a method of selectively expanding human leukemic cells in a non-adult NOD/SCID/IL2rg",
            "LEUKEMIA STEM CELL MARKERS - The invention provides a test method for predicting the initial onset or a recurrence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) comprising (1) measuring the expression level of human leukemic stem cell (LSC) marker genes in a biological sample collected from a subject for a transcription product or translation product of the gene as an analyte and (2) comparing the expression level with a reference value; an LSC-targeting therapeutic agent for AML capable of suppressing the expression of a gene selected from among LSC marker genes or a substance capable of suppressing the activity of a translation product of the gene; a method for producing a sample containing hematopoietic cells for autologous transplantation or allogeneic transplantation for AML patients comprising obtaining an LSC-purged sample with at least 1 kind of LSC marker as an index; and a method of preventing or treating AML.",
            "AGENT FOR PREVENTING RECURRENCE OF LEUKEMIA - The present invention provides a drug capable of initiating the progression of the cell cycle of leukemia stem cells to overcome the resistance of the leukemia stem cells to cell cycle-dependent chemotherapeutic agents, and a drug for suppressing recurrence of leukemia containing the same, and the like, an agent containing G-CSF, wherein the agent is for inducing the progression of the cell cycle of leukemia stem cells, a drug for suppressing recurrence of leukemia containing a combination of G-CSF and a cell cycle-dependent antitumor agent, and the like.",

            "GENETICALLY MODIFIED NON-HUMAN ANIMALS AND METHODS RELATING TO INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM RESPONSE DETECTION - Described herein are immunodeficient non-human animals lacking expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) by endogenous autogeneic innate immune cells, as well as methods and compositions for engraftment of xenogeneic hematopoietic stem cells in the immunodeficient non-human animal lacking expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), thereby creating an innate immune system in the animal derived from the xenogeneic hematopoietic stem cells. Further described are immunodeficient mice lacking expression of toll-like receptor 4 by endogenous autogeneic innate immune cells, as well as methods and compositions for engraftment of xenogeneic hematopoietic stem cells in the immunodeficient mouse lacking expression of toll-like receptor 4, thereby creating an innate immune system in the animal derived from the xenogeneic hematopoietic stem cells."

Shultz, Bar Harbor, ME US 07-23-2015 PORTABLE COMBUSTION DEVICE UTILIZING THERMOELECTRICAL GENERATION - This invention provides a portable combustion device that provides a cleaner combustion, provides a more efficient overall combustion through the use of a fan that directs a predetermined volume of airflow over the combustible fuel\u2014typically wood or similar cellulose-based biological solids and provides a cooking surface that is a grill top. The combustion device has a combustion chamber into which the fuel source is placed for combustion. Mounted to the side of the combustion chamber is a housing that encloses the TEG, which generates an electrical output, based on a difference in temperature on opposing sides. Mounted onto the TEG housing and protruding into the combustion chamber through a small passageway is a heat-conducting probe and heat-conducting probe base unit. 20150201805 Published Description Patent application number Kurtis Shultz, Bellingham, WA US 09-13-2012 REMOTE PENDANT WITH EXTENDED USER INTERFACE - A remote pendant for a metrology machine. The pendant comprises a non-configurable user interface which is an extension of the main computer monitor wherein the screens shown on a monitor of the pendant are created by application and/or control software running on the computer control of the machine. The remote pendant further comprises camera and/or webcam features as well as voice recording capabilities. With the remote pendant, the machine operator can view messages appearing on the main computer screen and respond",
