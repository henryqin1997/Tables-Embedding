            "Financial services stuff can get scary when you hear the issues. He has owned this for a very long time. Waiting for the conference call to explain what is going on and get a better feeling as to what is happening. They preannounced $1.03 in earnings. Still believes in the valuation. A lot of people have concerns with the mortgage market and what is going to happen with housing prices. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "They terminated 15% of their broker relationships last week. They found out they are taking on too much risk. They cut their growth targets. He does not know if there is more bad stuff to come. Wait a quarter to see what plays out. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "Replaced one of their chief risk officers. It looks cheap and would typically be the kind of thing he would look at hard. They are the financier for people who can\u2019t get financing from banks. In a tightening cycle, Canada is going to shrink and we are going to see a squeeze take place over the coming years. Credit quality is going to be the biggest thing with this company. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "Feels the recent stock correction was overdone. They reported some earnings that weren\u2019t as good as the market had expected. Short-sellers in the US are trying to make a lot of money on the situation. If the stock came off anymore, he would seriously consider getting into it. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "This was a very long-standing large position at his firm. He started to come to the belief that the Canadian housing market was starting to get too richly valued. The stock is now value again and is trading at about 7X earnings. Fantastic management, but they have stated that they are more disciplined in pulling back their horns on lending. This is a key tell on what has happened on the Canadian housing market. Wouldn\u2019t sell at these levels. Good value, but he doesn\u2019t like the outlook for the industry. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "Had a big drop today and thinks it was precipitated because RBC downgraded the stock, not because they are negative on the housing market, but because of their concerns about slowing revenue growth. There is a big US Short position and they have been waiting and waiting for the Canadian housing market to fall. His sense is that the housing market is going to have to pause. Population growth is only going to take the housing market so far. Not a stock that he would want to own. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "Tied to the vagaries of the Canadian housing market. It is highly regional. It is well run. There has been a big short position on this one. A lot of it he argues is ill-informed US investors who believe the Canadian housing market is in bubble territory. He believes we will soft land in real estate in Canada and this won\u2019t affect HCG-T much. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "Focused on Canadian housing for mortgage lending. Have done a very good job. She doesn\u2019t expect a housing collapse, but probably a flattening out of the growth rate, which will be regionally based. For a financial exposure, she would much rather buy a Canadian bank that has a more diversified revenue stream. 2.1% dividend yield. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "A mortgage lender that works outside the world of the big Canadian banks. Yielding about 2% and year-to-date it is down about 12%. If interest rates go up, it could work well for their interests. He would probably be interested in looking at the name. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "It is okay to hold this stock. It is a derivative of oil because of the momentum out of Western Canada. He thinks we are at $50-60 this year and $60-70 next year. At that rate Calgary will do \u2018okay\u2019. Then there will always be a discount on this stock. He was short at the beginning of this year, but is not any longer. / 1 comment Tweet finance",
            "He does not hold it because of a lack of price momentum. It has always been a favourite of US short sellers. The valuation is not bad and they have a good history of return on equity. They recently missed on one of their quarters and is probably why it fell off. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "Great company, very, very efficient in the way they use their money. They are so well financed so if there is a drop in home prices they will still be okay. It is a decent entry point here. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "(A Top Pick May 9/14. Down 5.49%.) Had the rap before this quarter of been an alternative lender, and therefore subject to high loan losses and loose credit standards, so people gave it a low price earnings multiple. This quarter, their loan losses were lower than any of the banks, but there mortgage originations were down because they tightened their credit standards, so the market sold off because it didn\u2019t have any growth. Very prudent lenders, and their credit history is excellent. Their growth is good and their return on equity is close to 20%. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "Has never sold a share and it is a great long-term investment. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "This is a prime target that US hedge funds use if they want to Short the Canadian housing market. The reason is that banks are not as focused on the housing market. A great company and very well-managed. They had 2 quarters where there were misses, and the share price reacted quite negatively. Good company, but just expensive at times. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance"
