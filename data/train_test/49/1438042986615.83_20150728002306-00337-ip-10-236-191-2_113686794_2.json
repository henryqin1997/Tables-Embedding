    "textBeforeTable": "The <IfVersion> section encloses configuration directives which are executed only if the httpd version matches the desired criteria. For normal (numeric) comparisons the version argument has the format major[.minor[.patch]], e.g. 2.1.0 or 2.2. minor and patch are optional. If these numbers are omitted, they are assumed to be zero. The following numerical operators are possible: mod_version Module: Extension Status: All Override: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Context: <IfVersion [[!]operator] version> ... </IfVersion> Syntax: contains version dependent configuration Description: <IfVersion> Directive Comments <IfVersion> Directives See below for further possibilities. <IfVersion 2.1.0> # current httpd version is exactly 2.1.0 </IfVersion> <IfVersion >= 2.2> # use really new features :-) </IfVersion> Examples This module is designed for the use in test suites and large networks which have to deal with different httpd versions and different configurations. It provides a new container -- <IfVersion>, which allows a flexible version checking including numeric comparisons and regular expressions.

    "textAfterTable": "Example <IfVersion >= 2.1> # this happens only in versions greater or # equal 2.1.0. </IfVersion> Besides the numerical comparison it is possible to match a regular expression against the httpd version. There are two ways to write it: operator description = or == version has the form /regex/ ~ version has the form regex Example <IfVersion = /^2.1.[01234]$/> # e.g. workaround for buggy versions </IfVersion> In order to reverse the meaning, all operators can be preceded by an exclamation mark (!): <IfVersion !~ ^2.1.[01234]$> # not for those versions </IfVersion> If the operator is omitted, it is assumed to be =.
