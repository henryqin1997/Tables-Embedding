The scope of the invention is solely defined by the appended claims. , management processor 306-A and management processor 306-B both initialize their own domains as described above. A clash occurs when both management processor try to initialize the same switching node 302-S. To address the clash, suppose that management processor 306-A initializes switching node 302-S first. When management processor 306-B tries to re-initialize the switching node 302-S by sending it a command frame 410, the command engine 310 of switching node 302-S will send the corresponding acknowledgment back to management processor 302-A because management processor 306-A is the controlling management processor 306 of switching node 302-S in accordance with the then current configuration. The management processor 302-A recognizes the clash when the management processor 302-A receives an acknowledgment for a command frame 410 that it never sent. Following the receipt of such an acknowledgement, management processors 306-A and 306-B communicate directly and negotiate which switching nodes will be controlled by each. FIG. 10 In . FIG. 10 . As long as each switching node 302 has knowledge of the location of its own controlling management processor 306, the methods and algorithms described above apply with no modification.",
