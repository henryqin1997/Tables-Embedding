    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The present invention as disclosed herein includes a control system for an underground boring machine 20. The control system advantageously provides for automatic control of the displacement and rotation rates of a boring tool 42 so as to increase drilling and reaming efficiency and maintain drilling conditions within safe operating parameters. It will, of course, be understood that various modifications and additions can be made to the preferred embodiments discussed hereinabove without departing from the scope or spirit of the present invention. Accordingly, the scope of the present invention should not be limited by the particular embodiments discussed above, but should be defined only by the claims set forth below. If, at step 360, it is determined that the automatic liquid pump control mode of operation is not selected, the controller 50 then determines, at step 368, whether the variable liquid pump flow rate mode has been selected. If, at step 370, the variable rate mode has been selected, the liquid is pumped at the selected rate. If, however, the variable rate mode has not been selected, as is tested at step 368, the controller 50 then determines whether the full flow rate mode has been selected, at step 372. If the full flow rate mode has been selected, the liquid is pumped at full flow, as indicated at step 370. If the full flow rate mode has not been selected, the controller 50 disengages power",
