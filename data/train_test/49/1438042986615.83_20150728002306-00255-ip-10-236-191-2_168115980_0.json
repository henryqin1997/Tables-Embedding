    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{14761=As my buddy said, this ticket speculation is just all a good downpayment on Bryce Harper's new contract.If the Nats have a windfall of an extra 50,000 tickets sold at an average of $30 each then the team will take in $1.5 million additional. Ok, not a downpayment on Bryce Harper, rather the remaining payments on Bruney's contract (LOL)The team is playing well and for the first time since 2005 deserves some big crowds.I bought tickets off of StubHub for June 8th, June 9th, and June 19th and June 20th just in case there is a rainout.I am contemplating purchasing tickets for the Friday and Saturday games in Baltimore too.Yah, I am buying into the hype so I can say in 30 years that I was there when\u2026, 48618=I have a 20-game plan and neither June 4 nor June 8 was part of the package. I fell for the June 4 rumors and bought seats in a nicer section than normal for face value on Stub Hub. I was initially grumpy when I saw that I lost the gamble, but at least i get to see Livo pitch while sitting down close to the field instead of from up in my seat in the 300s. Even though I was a still little ticked off at the fact they let the rumors fly for so long, once I saw the story about Pudge's injury affecting the call-up date it made sense to me. It's hard to be angry. If I bought a fancy new car I probably wouldn't want the first driver to be someone who isn't quite ready for everyday driving conditions. Let Pudge teach this kid well and guide him through his first start. The first game will be exciting, but even more fun will be watching him develop over the next couple of years., 46253=Can June 4th be a sellout if only 5,000 people attend the game? I like the players but that would be downright funny to see everyone either skipping or trading the tix in for a later game., 18825=Section 222, Just got off the phone with the Nats sales team and shockingly, the Nats have changed their rules (I was informed that they can do it at any time) and June 8th is no longer a ticket exchange day. So all of us STH that missed a game get to miss another! Sweet! I hope it rains in 'cuse and on the 8th., 34713=Yes, great points above when thinking June 4th was skipped for Stephen's sake and not the team's sake. The Pirates were targeted for matchups and forego the Reds on June 4th which really will cost the Nats in the pocketbook as Strasburg is still pitching\u2014just in the Minor Leagues and June 4th will not be a sell-out although probably over 30,000 in tickets sold not 41,000+. I think for every game Stephen pitches at home and on the road will have a boost in sales.When the calendar gives you a matchup like the Pirates in your 2nd homestand of June, you take the team that is 2nd to last in MLB batting average & OBP which is the Pirates instead of the surprising team that is #1 in NL batting average at .275 and sitting in 1st place now too in the NL Central.You want every early success that you can grab for Stephen Strasburg, which then sets up Strasburg for his 2nd start in Cleveland instead of Detroit. After that, the Nats have a lot of scheduled off days so you wonder how Rizzo and Riggleman will take into consideration those off-days if they really want to maximize Stephen's home appearances and best matchups.At the end of June (Atlanta) or beginning of July (Mets) will be the best offensive teams he could face before the All Star break and will likely face one or the other., 29772=60% chance of rain in Buffalo on Thursday with rain in the morning and afternoon so it is possible that the SS will get his start on Thursday, which will impact when and where he starts next. June 4th looks like it could be a rainout here in DC and June 6th or June 9th could be rainouts too based on the current forecasts, so no idea when and where he starts! Save your money buy your tickets day of., 59846=May 31, 2010, 11:51 PM EDT, 38473=Re: June 4 \u2014 I'm pretty sure that the number that is announced nowadays for \"attendance\" is actually \"tickets sold\". When I was a kid, they used to announce \"tickets sold\" *AND* \"attendance\" (which was the actual turnstile count), and you could figure the no-shows by subtraction. They don't do that any more., 28746=Steve M. said\u2026 \"June 4th will not be a sell-out although probably over 30,000\"Is over., 19750=Section 222,According to my ticket rep, the Nats held back thousands of tickets for June 8 for Major League Baseball. Teams are supposed to do this for important games. After MLB decides how many they want, the team then sells them. In the case of the Nats, they first offer them to STHs., 11203=@N. Cognito, you're right. At the end of last year, STHs stormed the gates with their unused tickets and all the remaining rightfield grandstand seats on the last unused ticket exchange game were gone. So the Nats opened up additional games to accommodate the demand. That was a classy thing to do, and why not let STHs fill up seats that otherwise probably won't get sold? I took my entire office to a game with unused ticket exchanges. @Chris, I don't have a problem at all with them withdrawing this particular game from the list now that tickets to it have become a hot item. The perk wasn't designed as a way for STHs to get highly sought after tickets for nothing. (Note the list of games \u2014 Rockies, Marlins, Braves, Pirates, Reds (6/5), DBacks, Giants, Padres, and Astros.) Three weeks ago, you probably could have used some unused tickets to score seats for June 8 just in case. (I used Red Carpet Reward points on May 14 to get extra seats for all six games for the upcoming homestand. Anyone need a ticket for June 4, 6, 9, or 10? ) If the Nats are still in the hunt for a playoff spot in late September and drawing big crowds, I wouldn't be surprised if they withdraw the Sept. 20, 22, and 23 games vs. the Astros from the list a week before they happen. But if you want to exchange your unused tickets for those games now just in case, you can certainly do that., 35411=I think Strausburgeoning should hereafter be the official term for June 8th., 37499=What happens if his start on Thursday is rained out? Do they push his MLB start to June 9th? And are there any other scenarios where they might push it to the 9th? Thanks!, 24928=My Nats rep told me that the number of tickets that will go on sale to STHs tomorrow is in the thousands. That might explain the thousands of tickets for June 4 that magically appeared once it became clear that June 4 was not going to be the debut date. Hard to believe, but the Nats might have been holding back some tickets so that STHs would get first crack at some additional seats once the date was set., 28031=Mark,What is your opinion about the possibility of the date moving if an when the rains come on his start or one of the other Nats games between now and June 8th??? And as a follow-up question, how could rain between now and the 8th factor into who gets sent back to Syracuse or DFA'd?, 8994=I think some people want to b-tch and moan for the sake of complaining.June 8th is now a Premium game. The ticket exchange program wasn't in place to trade up for Premium games.There will probably be more demand then the supply of tickets. It is event driven. This is the biggest sports event here since game 7 of the Stanley Cup playoffs (18,277 for hockey) and the biggest event in baseball since Opening Day 2008., 43083=June 4th is not a sellout. Lotsd of tickets available., 13430=Chris, the way I see it, they didn't pull the benefit, they just eliminated of the \"selected\" games for which it could be redeemed, a list which was already limited in nature. And it's not like they revoked exchanges that people had already claimed for the 8th, they just stopped giving them out a week ahead. So they took a perk and eliminated one of many options available as part of that park a week out- a diminution of value, but only barely so. If they had eliminated the June 8 game from the exchange back April for other reasons- maybe they scheduled a rare bobblehead promotion that day- or never included it in the first place, you likely never would have noticed the diminution of value. You're only noticing it now because they took away an opportunity to game their system in an unanticipated way.Any criticism from a STH is a valid criticism, but I just don't see it., 31730=I have a 20-game plan (Teddy) that includes tickets to both June 4 & 8, & just got an e-mail from the Nats that says that, starting @ 10 AM tomorrow, I can purchase on-line a limited number of tickets to the Strasburg-fest. Wonder how long they'll last? My son goes to the Univ of Wisconsin, & they tried the same system last year for all the student tickets for home football games. Everything sold out in 15 minutes. But then again, football at Wisconsin is probably slightly more popular than baseball in DC \ud83d\ude09, 59183=Fans have been anticipating the 21-year-old right-hander\u2019s arrival in Washington since he was drafted No. 1 overall last June out of San Diego State. It became clear this spring he would spend the season\u2019s first two months in the minor leagues, then most likely make his big-league debut sometime during the Nationals\u2019 June 4-10 homestand against the Reds and Pirates. By delaying his arrival until now, the Nats will ensure he cannot become arbitration-eligible until after the 2013 season., 7952=I'm hearing from an inside source that Strasburg's debut may slide to Wed. June 9th. His media interviews are now set for Thursday morning after his start. Has anyone else heard the same?, 41726=Here is one of my thoughts between the Reds series and the Pirates series for the Nats brass and Stras.If your goal is to start your prized youngster out the right way, why not match him up with the best outcome to win.The Reds are doing real well and Pitt may be the easier matchup.Just a thought on how things may have gone down to settle in on June 8th., 21897=Agreed @Bowdenball. A collection of cheap hats isn't quite what we want, right? Here's one perk that they probably can't deliver on though, nor should they: June 8 is actually one of the 14 \"unused ticket exchange dates\". Good luck exchanging your unused tickets for that game now!, 59393=The Nationals announced this evening that Stephen Strasburg \u2014 barring any rainouts, injuries or other unforeseen circumstances \u2014 will make his major-league debut June 8 against the Pirates.}",
