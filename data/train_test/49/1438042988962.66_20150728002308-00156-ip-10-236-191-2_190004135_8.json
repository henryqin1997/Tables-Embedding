    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{1976=For 2G you have to have a phone that supports 850 and 1900 MHz bands. From Europe or Asia a tri- or even better a quad-band phone does this. AT&T is better on 850 MHz, T-Mobile on 1900 MHz if you have a tri-band. On 2G you can only get EDGE with slow data speeds up to 200 kbps. AT&T plans to shut down its 2G network in 2017 altogether., 1215=Now it\u2019s getting complicated. AT&T has a good (though sometimes slow) coverage on 850 MHz up to HSPA+ (21 Mbps) speed. This is supplemented with spectrum on 1900 MHz in the cities. When checking frequencies on your device, be aware that 1900 MHz on 2G does not automatically mean, that it is on the same frequency on 3G. T-Mobile used to operate 3G on the 1700 MHz (= AWS) band only. This is (almost) the only operator in the world on this frequency, so hardly any non-T-Mobile US phone can cope with it. AWS is sometimes referred as \u201c1700/2100\u201d MHz suggesting a 2100 MHz phone would work. This is misleading as AWS is using the 1700 spectrum for uploading and 2100 for downloading and can\u2019t be handled by a 2100 MHz-only device. Luckily, T-Mobile changed the game when it acquired new frequencies in 2012. They were now shifting (or \u201crefarming\u201d) the most of their 3G spectrum from 1700 AWS to 1900 MHz (= PCS). This gives much better compatibility with lot of devices like the iPhone. In 2014 the refarming has been completed and 1900 MHz DC-HSPA (up to 42 Mbps) coverage is guaranteed in these major areas aka \u201cmarkets\u201d (unfortunately T-Mobile doesn\u2019t release a 1900 MHz-only map):}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{56400=Tracfone is another MVNO of the Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil family (see above) on Verizon and AT&T networks. Starting in summer 2015 Tracfone allows \"BYOP\" (= Bring your own phone) GSM devices for their AT&T based SIM cards. AT&T's 4G/LTE is supported too., 32814=Their SIM Cards are available only online as mini-, micro- or nano-SIMs for $4.99 to be sent to an US postal address. International customers can use vendors on Ebay who do overseas shipping for a surcharge. Refills can be done offline at Western Union outlets (list). Available are top-ups of 10, 20 or 30 $ which keep the card active for 90 days each. Online you can use www.callingmart.com without surcharge via PayPal or credit card. Activation is done online here or by calling 888 944 2355 from another phone., 4406=to be closed down in 2017, 53897=When all data is used, speed will be reduced to 64 kbps. Activation can be done here. Customer support is 877 836 2368 or online www.net10.com, 4617=1700, 1900 MHz, 23840=Top ups can be done online, but you seem to need an US-issued credit card. Foreigners should use vouchers instead called refill cards available at T-Mobile stores, many supermarkets, gas stations, Walgreen\u2019s and CVM drugstores, 7/11 and many other places. Minimum value is $10. The SIM is valid for 90 days after the last refill. Beyond that, it will be terminated and the remaining credit is lost. Since August of 2014 T-Mobile has a $3 monthly minimum charge., 83644=Ultra Mobile is another MVNO that started in 2012 using the T-Mobile network in 2G, 3G and 4G/LTE (see T-Mobile section and Basics for details)., 29816=These packs can be booked online on demand through your account and don\u2019t renew themselves. One day is 0.00-23.59h on Pacific Time., 22760=The activation kit comes only with an activation code and no number assigned to it. Activation is done by calling 877-778-2107 from any phone, *611 from T-Mobile phone or online HERE. This is where you can choose your number and plan too. Signing up can be done while you are in the US or before at home. You will get a text message for verification. This SMS used not to be forwarded abroad when roaming on a network other than T-Mobile US. Recently, first users succeeded in activating it through non-US roaming networks. So you might give it a try before leaving for the US., 17119=Unused data will not roll over to the next month. Plans expire in 30 days and can be renewed prior to expiration as long as the account is active. They don\u2019t renew automatically. No voice or text on this line. Accounts can be managed online or by calling 866 707 5550. Accounts for data only plans are cancelled 365 days after the last plan expires (ie if you have a plan for January 2015 and it expires on 1st Feb 2015 then you can still renew the plan anytime until 1st Feb 2016. After that time the account is closed and you must get a new SIM card). This expiry time is longer than for phone plans (which expire 60 days after the last plan expires).\u00a0, 21314=Their starter packs are called \u201cactivation kits\u201d and consist of a SIM card and an explanation leaflet in English and Spanish. It's available online to be sent to an US postal address for free, at T-Mobile stores (locator) and other stores without ID. Note: activation kits sold in T-Mobile stores have to be activated at time of purchase, you can not buy just the SIM card. Micro-, mini- and nano-SIMs are available or may be cut to size. The official price in stores has been raised at the end of 2014 to $15 (plus tax) containing about $3 credit. Some shops want to charge even higher prices or hefty fees for cutting. So it's a good idea to buy the SIM in advance by independent merchants on Ebay (search for \u201cT-Mobile Activation Kit\u201d) which are also shipped overseas for a small fee to avoid being overcharged. They have often bought the activation kits at one of T-Mobile's many promotions for $1. But you can't rely on getting one for this start-up price on location., 12277=At least some non-US-issued credit cards can be added to the account (see above). If you don\u2019t succeed in adding yours, just buy vouchers called refill cards in the US. They are available at AT&T stores, many supermarkets, gas stations, Walgreen\u2019s and CVM drugstores, 7-Eleven and many other outlets. Minimum value is $15. A refill of $15 is valid for 30 days, up to $50 for 90 days and from $100 for 365 days. Take care: If not used up and extended in time, your credit will be lost, the account closed and the SIM card terminated. The account closure time differs between phone and data-only plans (as of March 2015 the phone plans close 60 days after last expiry and data plans 365 days after last expiry)., 5330=If you need further infomation, check out this brilliant updated survey: http://www.prepaidphonenews.com/2011/03/us-prepaid-gsm-voice-text-and-data.html, 24696=Note that the \"pay by day\" daily rates have been discontinued in January 2015 and can't be booked anymore., 2215=T-Mobile started to shut down 1700 AWS in these markets in 2015 and keeps on shifting more markets from 1700 MHz AWS to 1900 MHz PCS on 3G. To add to the confusion T-Mobile used to call its enhanced UMTS a \u201c4G\u201d network as it uses DC-HSPA which gives up to 42 Mbps theoretically on UMTS-based technology while 4G is synonymous with LTE technology in the most parts of the world., 2941=AT&T started its 4G/LTE in 2011 on 700 and 1700 MHz depending on region added by 1900 MHz later in some city centers. It covers 280 Mio. people in 2014 in THESE areas. T-Mobile started with real 4G/LTE in 2013 on the refarmed AWS frequency of 1700 MHz and aquired licences on 700 and 1900 MHz in some areas only to reach 250 Mio. people already in 2014 in\u00a0THESE areas. Unfortunately all mentioned LTE frequencies are hardly used for LTE anywhere else in the world and a phone from outside the US is unlikely to handle US LTE. Nevertheless, Qualcomm produces a multiband chipset which can cope with more than 30 different LTE bands which are in use worldwide nowadays. At least LTE is able to bridge the gap to CDMA (see above) as both systems agreed on the same technology for 4G/LTE., 28165=Effective June 2015 T-Mobile opens the unrestricted use of all plans through a hotspot. Only the $30 plan is limited to 100 MB hotspot data.}",
