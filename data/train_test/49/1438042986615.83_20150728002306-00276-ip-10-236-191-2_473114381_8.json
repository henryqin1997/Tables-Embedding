The error detection/correction status includes information, such as the number of retries and the number of error corrections for every communication line. This information relates to the processing actually executed in communication but could not be observed in the conventional art, so that the status of communication failures which have not resulted in an abnormal communication can be readily observed. By analyzing the communication failures for individual communication lines, the communication line which needs a countermeasure against noise from outside will be found. After taking a necessary countermeasure, the effect thereof can be checked by performing the error detection/correction communications and displaying the error detection/correction status again. Thus, the cause for the stop of the system due to noise penetrated into the communication line is analyzed and eliminated. Since the displayed information regarding the communication is not only a list of the individual information but also summarized as the communication failure frequency and the cumulative number of communication failures, it is made easier to consider the countermeasure and to confirm the effect of the countermeasure. With the above steps, the parameter modifying processing is completed. Step i5: A command is issued to the error detection/correction status storing means 2 to delete the information for individual communication lines, thereby erasing the",
