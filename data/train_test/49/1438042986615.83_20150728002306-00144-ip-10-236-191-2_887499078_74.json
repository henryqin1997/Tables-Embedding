            "Blinn College is a great opportunity for students to get their basic core curriculum out of the way at a significantly cheaper price as it is a junior college. Not to mention, Blinn College shares some staff with Texas A&M so you're not only being taught at a cheaper price but you're gaining the same knowledge as you would at A&M and being set up for success at a lower price.",
            "I am going to the Bryan campus; with that being said, I'm living in College Station so there is plenty to do! College Station is a wonderful college town full of activities anywhere from going to the movies, to bowling, to the infamous and widely visited Puppy Station at Post Oak Mall where you can sit and play with puppies for hours on end, no joke. There are plenty of great places to grab some food including the Dixie Chicken, Potato Shack, Chuy's, Chipotle, Panera Bread, and so many more. With it being a college town, there's always late hours so after you're done studying, you can go celebrate at Northgate and then grab some Ihop before heading home late at night. Everyone is extremely friendly so you'll see friends from school, friends of friends, and my personal favorite, friends from high school.",
            "I have not personally dined at Blinn College as I grabbed a few snacks and a drink at their bookstore before my academic advisement. However, walking through the campus, there are multiple places on campus to eat with a wide variety of food. Not to mention, Blinn is close to several restaurants and fast food places including McDonald's and Taco Bell.",
            "I don't plan to live on-campus but there are apartments nearby to campus, actually right across the street so I'm unable to comment on dorm life. However, College Station in general has a variety of student living facilities so there are plenty of options.",
            "Just like any educational institution, homework and out of class assignments are mandatory and beneficial to the students. This is college so the professors will not babysit you and let you make-up work if you miss an assignment. It's in the student's best interest to turn in assignments and apply themselves to best of their ability to succeed. I've learned first hand that college is a whole different ball park than high school. Prepare to work hard with little sleep.",
            "For prospective student of Blinn College and Texas A&M, I'd highly recommend not waiting to register for classes. Everyone is available to register for classes as payment isn't due till a later date so don't let finances stop you from registering for classes right away to ensure you to get the classes and times that are best suited for you.",
            "The campus is well-equipped with the necessary tools for students to excel in with open computer labs, out-of-class tutoring sessions, and a friendly staff that are guaranteed to help you succeed! I have had multiple friends attend this campus and I'll be joining this fall. I've been to the campus several times to seek academic advisement, turn in transcripts and register for classes. The campus itself is put together well and all buildings are in walking distance to ensure attendance to class."

    "textAfterTable": "Classes are hundreds of dollars cheaper than universities because Blinn is technically a community college, but the classes are just as challenging. Am enjoying being here It's close to my hometown, and Brenham is a great city. Not too big, but not to small. Am learning a lot It's definately a big change from high school. Some teachers are set in their ways and have their own methods, so you just have to go with the flow. Classes aren't that bad, even if you slacked in high school. Just apply yourself and you should do fine.
