No. 6,214,631, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety., 61961=SOLED 1200 is fabricated on substrate 1100, using a shadow mask having rectangular apertures, as follows:, 62354=Step 2: Deposit organic layer 1215 through the shadow mask. The rectangular aperture is preferably sufficiently large that organic layer 1215 completely covers contact pad 1110, yet not so large that contact pads other than contact pad 1110 are covered., 66473=Step 1: Deposit patterned conductive strips 1355., 66828=Step 4: Deposit patterned insulating strips 1370 over the results of step 3, perpendicular to and partially covering insulating strips 1360 and conductive strips 1365 and 1367., 56915=Preferably, the size of organic layers 815, 825 and 835 slightly larger than electrodes 820, 830, and 840, as shown in FIGS. 8 and 9, to reduce the possibility of edge shorting between electrodes. An edge short may occur where the organic layer used to separate electrodes just barely extends to the edge of the separated electrodes, as shown in FIG. 10. FIG. 10 shows portions of a first electrode 1010, an organic layer 1015, and a second electrode 1020, deposited in that order through the same shadow mask in the same position. Ideally, electrodes 1010 and 1020 would be completely separated by organic layer 1015, and there would be no contact between electrodes 1010 and 1020. However, if there is spreading during the deposition of the electrodes, or slight imperfections in the mask, the separated electrodes may come into contact at their edges, as shown in FIG. 10, where there is contact between electrodes 1010 and 1020. This contact may not be avoidable by moving the mask prior to the various deposition steps, such that organic layer 1015 extends further to the left than electrodes 1010 and 1020, because such movement may cause a short elsewhere. However, such contact may be avoidable by depositing organic layers that are larger than the electrodes. These larger layers may be deposited through the same shadow mask by positioning the shadow mask further from the substrate, which leads to increased spreading, and/or moving the shadow mask during the deposition of the larger layers. Such larger layers may have a decreased thickness at the edges. A decrease in the thickness of an organic layer between two electrodes may result in an undesirable decrease in resistance and increase in current flow and brightness at the point of least thickness. As a result, it is preferable that any such decrease in thickness occurs, where possible, at points that are not between electrodes, i.e., in the part of the organic layer that extends beyond the electrodes., 67783=Conductive strips 1355, 1365, 1367 and 1375 are made of a conductive material, such as gold, copper, aluminum, or similar materials. Insulating strips 1360 and 1370 and the passivating layer are made of a non-conducting material, such as polyimide or SiNx., 68408=SOLED 1400 includes a first organic layer 1415, a first electrode 1420, a second organic layer 1425, a second electrode 1430, an third organic layer 1435, and a third electrode 1440, sequentially deposited in that order. As with the third embodiment, each electrode is in contact with one and only one contact pad, and each organic \u201clayer\u201d may actually include a plurality of organic layers., 84705=First organic layer 315, deposited during step 2, was actually two layers: first, a 500 \u212b layer of 4,4\u2032-bis[N-(1-napthyl)-N-phenyl-amino]biphenyl (\u03b1-NPD) was deposited, followed by a 500 \u212b layer of aluminum tris(8-hydroxyquinolate) (Alq3). First organic layer 315 was designed to emit green light in response to an applied voltage. First electrode 320, deposited during step 4, was also two layers: first, a 100 \u212b layer of Mg:Ag alloy was deposited, followed by a 550 \u212b layer of indium tin oxide (ITO). Second organic layer 325, deposited during step 6, was actually four layers: first, a 50 \u212b layer of CuPc was deposited, followed by a 500 \u212b layer of \u03b1-NPD, followed by a 450 \u212b layer of bis-(8-hydroxy) quinaldine aluminum phenoxide (Alq\u20322OPh), followed by a 150 \u212b layer of Alq3. Second organic layer 325 was designed to emit blue light in response to an applied voltage. Second electrode 330, deposited during step 8, was two layers: first, a 100 \u212b layer of Mg:Ag alloy was deposited, followed by a 530 \u212b layer of ITO. Third organic layer 335, deposited during step 10, was actually four layers: first, a 50 \u212b layer of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) was deposited, followed by a 500 \u212b layer of \u03b1-NPD, followed by a 400 \u212b layer of Alq3 doped with 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaethyl-21H, 23H-porphine platinum (PtOEP), followed by a 150 \u212b layer of Alq3. Third organic layer 335 was designed to emit red light in response to an applied voltage. Third electrode 340, deposited during step 12, was two layers: first, a 100 \u212b layer of Mg:Ag alloy was deposited, followed by a 417 \u212b layer of ITO. The ITO was deposited by RF-magnetron sputtering, and all other materials were deposited by thermal evaporation. Precision movement frame 1700, and the attached shadow mask and substrate 200, were moved to the glove box for all steps involving movement of substrate 200 relative to the shadow mask, i.e., steps 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11, and were moved to a vacuum chamber for all steps involving deposition, i.e., steps 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12., 61050=SOLED 1200 includes a first organic layer 1215, a first electrode 1220, a second organic layer 1225, a second electrode 1230, an third organic layer 1235, and a third electrode 1240, sequentially deposited in that order. As with the first and second embodiments, each electrode is in contact with one and only one contact pad, and each organic \u201clayer\u201d may actually include a plurality of organic layers., 66357=Contact pads 1310, 1320, 1330 and 1340 may be fabricated as follows:, 65741=FIG. 13 shows contact pads on a substrate 1300, over which a two-by-two array of pixels of the fourth embodiment may be fabricated. Each pixel on substrate 1300 has a rectangular (preferably square) contact pad 1310, and three periphery contact pads 1320, 1330 and 1340. The voltages at the contact pads of each pixel is not controllable independently of the voltages at the other pixels. However, using passive matrix techniques known the art, the emission of each layer of each SOLED fabricated on substrate 1300 may be independently controlled., 60755=FIG. 12 shows a SOLED 1200 fabricated on top of substrate 1100. SOLED 1200 is one of the array of SOLEDs of the third embodiment, where the whole array may be fabricated simultaneously by using a shadow mask having multiple apertures, one for each SOLED., 74138=An electrical charge may be used to facilitate movement of the shadow mask and/or to secure the shadow mask in position during a process step such as deposition through the shadow mask. FIG. 16 shows a substrate 1600 similar to substrate 1500, but having a standoff 1605 with a conductive layer 1607. Standoff 1605 with conductive layer 1607 is adapted for use with a mask 1610 having a conductive layer 1612. Conductive layers 1607 and 1612 are connected to charge sources such that an electrical charge may be applied to each conductive layer. In order to secure mask 1610 in position, charges having opposite polarities may be applied to conductive layers 1607 and 1612, respectively. Conductive layer 1607 will then attract conductive layer 1612, securing the mask in position. In order to facilitate the movement of mask 1610, charges having the same polarities may be applied to conductive layers 1607 and 1612. Conductive layer 1607 will then repel conductive layer 1612, facilitating the movement of mask 1610. Electrical charges may be used in conjunction with a lubricant. Mask 1610 is shown slightly above standoff 1605, to more clearly illustrate that conductive layer 1607 is attached to standoff 1605 and not to mask 1610. Mask 1610 may be lowered slightly to place it in contact with standoff 1605., 64074=Step 12: Deposit electrode 1240 through the shadow mask. The fourth position should be selected such that electrode 1240 contacts periphery contact pad 1140, does not contact any electrodes or contact pads other than periphery contact pad 1140, and has a substantial overlap with organic layer 1235., 38620=It is sometimes desirable to fabricate a device from multiple materials, where the different materials have similar, but not identical, shapes, sizes and/or positions. It is known to deposit two or more such materials through the same shadow mask. For example, Miyaguchi et al., Organic LED Full Color Passive-Matrix Display, 9th International Workshop on Inorganic and Organic Electroluminescence, Extended Abstracts p. 127, Bend, Oreg., Sept. 14-17, 1998, discloses a multi-color passive-matrix display that uses three different organic materials to emit three different colors of light. These different organic materials are sequentially deposited through the same shadow mask, where the mask is moved in between depositions. However, the reference does not disclose how the position of the mask controlled., 82742=The SOLED was fabricated following the procedure described with respect to the first embodiment. Movement of substrate 200 relative to the shadow mask was performed in a glove box under N2 atmosphere by manually turning X-axis screw 1750, Y-axis screw 1760 and rotation control screw 1770. The initial alignment of the shadow mask and substrate (step 1 of the method of the first embodiment) was performed with the use of a charged coupled devices (CCD) camera system, which was used to view the substrate and triangular contact pad 210 through the aperture in the shadow mask to determine when triangular contact pad 210 was centered in the aperture. Subsequent movements of substrate 200 relative to the shadow mask (steps 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 of the method of the first embodiment) were also performed in the glove box, but relied on turning X-axis screw 1750 and/or Y-axis screw 1760 by a calculated amount, without relying on the camera system. In particular, the substrate was moved about 400 microns during each of these subsequent movement steps. During the deposition of organic layers, contact pad 210 was approximately centered in the triangular aperture. During the deposition of electrode layers, the point of contact pad 210 opposite the contact pad that the electrode contacts was approximately aligned with the corresponding point of the triangular aperture., 62100=Step 1: Position a shadow mask in a first position over substrate 1100, such that central contact pad 1110 is centered in the aperture. The shadow mask may be aligned with the substrate using techniques known to the art., 66696=Step 3: Deposit patterned conductive strips 1365 and 1367 on top of insulating strips 1360., 62766=Step 4: Deposit electrode 1220 through the shadow mask. The second position should be selected such that electrode 1220 contacts periphery contact pad 1120, does not contact any contact pads other than periphery contact pad 1120, and has a substantial overlap with organic layer 1215., 66549=Step 2: Deposit patterned insulating strips 1360, perpendicular to and partially covering conductive strips 1355., 35290=This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. F33615-94-1-1414, awarded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The Government has certain rights in this invention., 69307=SOLED 1400 is fabricated on substrate 1300, using a shadow mask having rectangular apertures, using a procedure analogous to that used to fabricate SOLED 1200 on substrate 1100. In particular, the SOLED of the fourth embodiment may be fabricated using a method similar to that used for the third embodiment, where contact pads 1310, 1320, 1330 and 1340, organic layers 1415, 1425, and 1435, and electrodes 1420, 1430 and 1440 are analogous to contact pads 1110, 1120, 1130 and 1140, organic layers 1215, 1225, and 1235, and electrodes 1220, 1230 and 1240., 87967=FIG. 19 shows current-voltage (I-V) plots for the SOLED. Plots 1910, 1920 and 1930 show I-V plots for organic layers 315, 325 and 335, respectively. The quantum efficiency at 10 mA/cm2 were 0.6%, 0.3% and 0.1% for bottom emissions, and 0.4%, 0.1%, and 0.4% for top emissions, for organic layers 315, 325 and 335, respectively., 68868=SOLED 1400 is adapted to emit light, preferably of three different colors, from each of first organic layer 1415, second organic layer 1425 and third organic layer 1435. As a result, SOLED 1400 may serve as an R-G-B (red-green-blue) pixel, adapted to emit a wide variety of colors of varying intensity in the visible spectrum, in a manner similar to SOLED 300 of FIG. 3., 63876=Step 10: Deposit organic layer 1235 through the shadow mask., 78285=A larger number of electrodes may also be used. For example, a three-color SOLED having five electrodes, i.e., four electrodes plus one contact pad that directly contacts an organic layer, may be fabricated. This larger number of electrodes allows the use of an insulating layer, which may greatly simplify the driving circuit used to control voltages, as described in Burrows et al., \u201cStacked Organic Light Emitting Devices,\u201d patent application Ser. No. 08/792,046, filed on Feb. 3, 1997, which is incorporated by reference. A larger number of contact pads may be used to accommodate the larger number of electrodes, or, where two grounded electrodes are desired, the second grounded electrode may be deposited so as to contact the first grounded electrode., 86887=FIG. 18 shows emission spectra from the organic layers 315, 325 and 335 of the fabricated SOLED, from the top (through electrode 340) and bottom (through substrate 200) of the device, from a direction normal to the plane of the SOLED, and from a direction 45 degrees off-normal. Plots 1810, 1812, 1814 and 1816 show the emission spectra of organic layer 315 from the bottom normal, bottom off-normal, top normal, and top off-normal directions, respectively. Plots 1820, 1822, 1824 and 1826 show the emission spectra of organic layer 325 from the bottom normal, bottom off-normal, top normal, and top off-normal directions, respectively. Plots 1830, 1832, 1834 and 1836 show the emission spectra of organic layer 335 from the bottom normal, bottom off-normal, top normal, and top off-normal directions, respectively. The observed shifts in the spectra as measured from different directions are due to microcavity effects., 67285=Step 7: Etch windows in the passivating layer for contact pads 1310, 1320, 1330 and 1340. In particular, the window for contact pad 1310 should expose a part of conductive strip 1355, the window for contact pad 1320 should expose conductive strip 1365, the window for contact pad 1330 should expose conductive strip 1375, and the window for contact pad 1340 should expose conductive strip 1367., 77780=Note that the Figures used to illustrate the various embodiments may not be drawn to scale, in order to more clearly illustrate the principles of the present invention. For example, the fill factor attainable with the present invention is much higher than shown in the Figures, because features such as the movement of the mask and the size of insulating strips 1360 and 1370, for example, have been exaggerated to more clearly illustrate the principles of the invention., 67052=Step 5: Deposit patterned conductive strips 1375 on top of insulating strips 1370., 72707=FIG. 15 shows a substrate 1500 having a standoff 1505. With reference to the second embodiment, for example, contact pads 1510, 1530 and 1550 are analogous to contact pads 710, 730 and 750, respectively, of FIGS. 7 and 8. A SOLED similar to SOLED 800 of FIG. 8 may be fabricated on substrate 1500, using a procedure similar to that used to fabricate SOLED 800. However, the vertical position of the shadow mask may be determined by contact with standoff 1505. Preferably, the area of the substrate and other features, such as contact pads, exposed by the patterning of the standoff is larger than the apertures in the shadow mask. Preferably, this exposed area is larger than the apertures by a margin sufficiently large that material deposited through the shadow mask is not deposited onto the standoff, allowing for movement of the shadow mask during fabrication., 63413=Step 8: Deposit electrode 330 through the shadow mask. The fourth position should be selected such that electrode 1230 contacts periphery contact pad 1130, does not contact any electrodes or contact pads other than periphery contact pad 1120, and has a substantial overlap with organic layer 1225., 59646=FIG. 11 shows contact pads on a substrate 1100, adapted for use with such a shadow mask, over which one of the array of SOLEDs of the third embodiment may be fabricated. Substrate 1100 has a rectangular (preferably square) contact pad 1110, and three periphery rectangular contact pads 1120, 1130 and 1140, where the periphery contact pads are positioned parallel to each other, as well as to a side of rectangular contact pad 1110. Substrate 1100 is preferably fabricated using techniques known to the art such that each contact pad 1110, 1120, 1130 and 1140 is either connected to ground, or has an independently controllable voltage. An array of pixels, each having four contact pads similar to contact pads 1110, 1120, 1130 and 1140 may be fabricated using techniques known to the art, and the voltages at the different pads of the different pixels may be controlled using any of a number of indexing techniques, such as active matrix, passive matrix, or direct addressing., 42102=FIG. 13 shows contact pads on a substrate 1300 adapted for use with a fourth embodiment of the present invention., 68112=FIG. 14 shows a SOLED 1400 fabricated on top of substrate 1300. SOLED 1400 is one of the array of SOLEDs of the fourth embodiment, where the whole array may be fabricated simultaneously by using a shadow mask having multiple apertures, one for each SOLED., 81893=Movement in the X-direction was controllable by turning X-axis screw 1750. Movement in the Y-direction was controllable by turning Y-axis screw 1760. Rotation in the X-Y plane was controllable by turning rotation control screw 1770. Because X-axis screw 1750 and Y-axis screw 1760 are attached to stage 1730, the rotation of stage 1730 also rotated the orientation of the X and Y axes. X-axis screw 1750, Y-axis screw 1760 and rotation control screw 1770 were AJS8-02H high precision screws, available from the Newport Corp. of Irvine, Calif. Stage 1730 could be moved relative to mask frame 1720 up to 0.25 inches in the X and Y direction, and up to 8 degrees in rotation, and the movement was controllable with a precision of about 12 microns., 61522=SOLED 1200 is adapted to emit light, preferably of three different colors, from each of first organic layer 1215, second organic layer 1225 and third organic layer 1235. As a result, SOLED 1200 may serve as an R-G-B (red-green-blue) pixel, adapted to emit a wide variety of colors of varying intensity in the visible spectrum, in a manner similar to SOLED 300 of FIG. 3., 81119=FIG. 17 shows a precision movement frame 1700 that was used to fabricate the three color SOLED. The shadow mask was held in place by a mask frame 1720, which is immovably attached to support frame 1710. Substrate 200 was held in place by a stage 1730. Stage 1730 was moveable relative to support frame 1710 and mask frame 1720. The separation between the shadow mask and substrate 200 is determined by the size of a stand 1740. In particular, that separation was approximately 12-25 nm. High vacuum compatible lubricant Microcote 296, available from Castrol Industrial North America Inc. of Downers Grove, Ill., was used in precision movement frame 1700 to facilitate movement., 63216=Step 6: Deposit organic layer 1225 through the shadow mask., 39457=The position of layers deposited through the same photoresist may be varied by varying the angle from which deposition occurs, as described by Burrows et al., \u201cMethod of Fabricating and Patterning OLEDs,\u201d patent application Ser. No. 08/977,205, filed on Nov. 24, 1997, and Forrest et al., \u201cMethod for Deposition and Patterning of Organic Thin Film,\u201d patent application Ser. No. 08/976,666, filed on Nov. 24, 1997, which are incorporated by reference. However, it is difficult to achieve uniform deposition onto an angled substrate over a wide area, unless the source to substrate distance is much greater than the size of the substrate, which would require a very large vacuum chamber.}",
