The campus is expanding in many ways including its parking. Having attended Texas State University in 2002 I can say for a college it offers everything along with many opportunities to network and get the full college experience., 626930=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 266574=The University of Texas-Pan American is a campus that I've been attending since 2005 and now going for my masters. The faculty are very helpful and do their best to help make my time here effortless.

Security is all around campus, and there are Emergency buttons almost at every corner. Clubs and Activities UTPA offers different activities including; Women's Soccer, Men's Soccer, Flag Football, Co-ed Kickball, Softball, Baseball, etc. Great for these types of students",
