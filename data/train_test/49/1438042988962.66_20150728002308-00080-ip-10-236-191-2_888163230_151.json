            "I have to admit, SCAD lacks in the safety of their students. Its not the school itself, because they try to prevent anything bad from happening and offer many opportunities to get out of bad situations. But, Savannah has a very high crime rate and it does happen around campus and to many students.",
            "SCAD doesn't have sororities or fraternities, everybody is treated as an equal.",
            "SCAD has endless clubs and activities, they are constantly making new clubs to fit every type of student there may be. Clubs typically meet weekly and work on something as a group to further their knowledge, beliefs, or hobbies.",
            "SCAD is fantastic for the creative and determined students. People who want to learn about their major as a career instead of just the basics.",
            "SCAD is full of unusual, not only are all the buildings in the Historic District of Downtown Savannah, but they are renovated jails, theaters, train stations, etc. SCAD has unusual traditions as well, such as the annual Sand Arts Festival, Art Walk, or Film Festival.",
            "SCAD is very expensive, but if you made good grades in high school and/or have a good portfolio, they offer great scholarships. After the great education you get out of it, with a little cushioned scholarship, SCAD comes out as a great deal for your money spent.",
            "There are so many opportunities for fun in Savannah. There are many parks throughout the city if you need a quit evening out or a game of ball. Also, Tybee Island is only a short twenty minute drive, everyone loves the beach. SCAD also offers nice outings such as a movie in the park or BBQ's.",
            "Not only is the food at SCAD itself very nice with the meal plan and SCAD based restaurants, but the local food and dining in Savannah is wonderful. There are very well known restaurants around town and many have been recognized through the media.",
            "The dorm life at SCAD seems to be very welcoming and has a sense of community where everyone knows each other. They are very safe and monitored by security guards 24/7 and have everything available to them.",
            "SCAD's academics are very tough but they teach you what you need to know for your desired field. The classes are fun yet very important and sometimes are very time consuming.",
            "Students who wish to attend SCAD should focus on their grades and portfolio to really excel in the school's environment and be accepted with flying colors. Its a great opportunity and leads to a promised future.",
            "SCAD is very focused on the future of their students. They do everything in their power to teach and prepare students for their prospected major. SCAD has an abundance of opportunities and is a fantastic school to be a attend."

You will surely flunk out if you slack on your work., 1008370=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 665532=The dorm got broken into and robbed at 6am the first week of the fall quarter in 2012. SCAD tried to cover it up, and none of our parents knew about it. But it was all over the news; unfortunately local news only. And nothing happens to the security guards who are always sleeping. My friend forgot her ID and flashed up a Pokemon card and was allowed access into the dorm., 29011=SCAD is an absolutely amazing school but just make sure you get more scholarships than the ones they provide. The grading there is a B- or B+ is the same as a B and a 3.5 G.P.A. is an average of an A (this is what you'll usually have to maintain to keep the scholarships they give to you. Basically be careful, it's hard to keep your grades in this category and they're sneaky and you don't find out what your grades are really going to have to be before you go there. Again, go to community college first, get the easy stuff over with. I can't imagine getting the things like english and math over while I'm there. It's the quarter system (you have three quarters/semesters in a year (fall quarter goes from September to November, Winter is January to March and Spring is from March to June.)) Everything is really fast paced and intense so you'd be better of going somewhere else first and transferring. SCAD is usually really good about how things transfer and you'll be more likely to get good scholarships that way as well., 254795=I visited the Atlanta campus back in January and it was beautiful. Unfortunately we were not able to view the freshmen dorms. Hopefully I will be able to view those soon., 36939=Savannah is truly the City of Hospitality. It is a beautiful, quaint town, with all the charm and allure of a big city. Broughton Street has every place you could hope to shop (and more!), and exploring the many side streets and lovely squares will yield hidden antique shops and thrift stores, perfect for rummaging through for the next art project. If you don't enjoy the heat, don't worry! Savannah cools off around November, and it's like most temperate places' autumn. The sunsets are glorious., 933985=These aren't really any traditions but usually Fall quarter students seem to have a lot more fun, and it's usually the time when students tend to slack off quite a bit. After winter break everyone's typically pretty calmed down and focused on their school and just trying to finish out the year. But for an FYI, most SCAD kids live in the apartment complex right next door to school- 1660 Apartments.}",

I wouldn't have gone to SCAD if I didn't have to financial aid to back me up. If this is a problem and you really want to go to SCAD, I recommend transferring like many of my friends and acquaintances who currently attend. Overall I would recommend this school to someone who is looking for a job in a creative oriented field. Many of the teachers used to work in the fields related to what they teach, the career",
