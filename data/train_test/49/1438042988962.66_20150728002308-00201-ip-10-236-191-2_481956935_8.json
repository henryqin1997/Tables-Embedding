Decision block 1001 determines if it is time to transmit the identification code of the fixed unit. Advantageously, the identification code is transmitted every tenth of a second. If the answer is no, control is transferred back to decision block 1001. If the answer is yes, decision block 1003 determines if battery monitor 702 of FIG. 7 is indicating a low battery. If the answer is no, block 1004 simply transmits the identification code of the fixed unit before transferring control back to decision block 1001. If the answer in decision block 1003 is yes, block 1006 transmits a message that includes the identification code and a low battery indication before transferring control back to decision block 1001., 29462=Since wireless terminal 112 has been assigned a new telephone number the features associated with that telephone number now are provided to wireless terminal 112 by wireless switching system 111. When a call is received from public telephone network 118 for telephone number 538-1902, wireless switching system 111 examines Table 1 of FIG. 4 and determines that the call should be routed to wireless terminal 112. One skilled in the art would readily recognize that the telephone numbers illustrated for each individual location in Table 2 would be placed in a hunt group by wireless switching system 111. Such a hunt group would allow a telephone call directed to a first number for a location to subsequently be transferred to a second number of the location if the first number of the location was busy., 27715=Consider now the example, where wireless terminal 112 moves from location 103 to location 104 via location 101. When wireless switching system 111 is informed by wireless terminal 112 that it is now in location 101, wireless switching system 111 determines from FIG. 2 that the assigned telephone number for wireless terminal 112 is not to be modified when the wireless terminal enters location 101. Consequently, wireless switching system 111 does not modify the current telephone number illustrated in Table 1 of FIG. 2 for wireless terminal 112. Further, consider when the wireless terminal moves to location 104. Upon being informed that wireless terminal 112 has entered location 104, wireless switching system 111 examines Table 2 of FIG. 3 for the telephone numbers assigned to location 104 at present, telephone number 538-1901 is assigned to wireless terminal 114. Hence, wireless switching system 111 assigns telephone number 538-1902 to wireless terminal 112. Table 1 of FIG. 2 is updated to reflect this change and the updated table is illustrated in FIG. 4. In addition, Table 2 of FIG. 3 would be updated to reflect the fact that wireless terminal 112 is now assigned telephone number 538-1902. If wireless terminal 114 had not been present in location 104 when wireless terminal 112 entered location 104, wireless terminal 112 would have been assigned telephone number 538-1901. Table 2 of FIG. 3 will also be updated to reflect the fact that telephone number 538-3901 is no longer assigned to wireless terminal 112.}",

These changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention and without diminishing its attendant advantages. It is therefore intended that such changes and modifications be covered by the following claims. FIG. 10 illustrates the steps performed by a fixed unit. Decision block 1001 determines if it is time to transmit the identification code of the fixed unit. Advantageously, the identification code is transmitted every tenth of a second. If the answer is no, control is transferred back to decision block 1001. If the answer is yes, decision block 1003 determines if battery monitor 702 of FIG. 7 is indicating a low battery. If the answer is no, block 1004 simply transmits the identification code of the fixed unit before transferring control back to decision block 1001. If the answer in decision block 1003 is yes, block 1006 transmits a message that includes the identification code and a low battery indication before transferring control back to decision block 1001. If the answer in decision block 901 is yes, control is transferred to decision block 903 which determines if a transmission signal is being detected. If the answer in decision block 903 is no, control is transferred to block 906. The wireless handset transmits a \u201cno fixed",
