While the present invention has been illustrated by description of several embodiments and while the illustrative embodiments have been described in considerable detail, it is not the intention of the applicant to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail. Additional advantages and modifications may readily appear to those skilled in the art. depicts another optimal situation wherein the anvil lockout mechanism 260 does not interact with the upper pin 38 of the firing bar. As an illustration, the end effector 12 is depicted as having clamped a minimal amount of tissue 248. The end effector 12 may even be initially pinched at its distal end such as due external pressure on the end effector 12. The upper pin 38 is aligned with the anvil slot 42 and enters without necessarily contacting the anvil lockout mechanism. Thereafter the upper pin 38 reacts vertically against the anvil slot 42 as necessary to ensure that the anvil 18 and elongate channel 16",
