The shopping cart will automatically update the quoted price as you adjust the length of your rental. Our most common rental periods are shown below: Any of our Nikon lenses This adapter provides no electronic communication between the camera and lens. All aperture and focus adjustments must be made manually on the lens itself. The aperture selected will not be displayed on the camera, and it will not show up in the EXIF data. This adapter allows the use of all lenses compatible with Nikon non-G mounts to be used on Micro 4/3 cameras. Only manual aperture Nikon lenses will work with this adapter. If your lens does not have an external aperture control, there is no way to set aperture on lenses where aperture is controlled electronically. In that case, you need the Micro 4/3 camera to Nikon G Lens. Shipping Pricing Works Well With Overview",
