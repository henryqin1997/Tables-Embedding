A story published in South Africa\u2019s newspaper Mail & Guardian on November 23, 2012, reports that sex workers in Rustenburg are victims of targeted abuse by three entities during raids: the police, a \u2018Citizens\u2019 Forum for Change\u2019 and the municipality\u2019s public safety department. \u201cThey are confronted by a convoy of marked police vehicles, pepper-sprayed, assaulted and searched before being shoved into a vehicle,\u201c the article reveals. The full story speaks of what seem to be clear violations of the fundamental human right to life, liberty and security (article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights)., 13797=Contact us | Editorial policy | Glossary | Association for Progressive Communications (APC) 2014 Unless otherwise stated, content on the APC website is licenced under CreativeCommons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Developed by GreenNet Web Projects | Design by Grupo Triton, 9741=In March 2013, the petition will be handed over to Rashida Manjoo, United Nations Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women and Anand Grover, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Our goal is to gather 1,000 signatures by the end of March 2013., 8105=Finally, in a recently published article, sex work advocates from several countries declared what \u201csex workers have been saying for years: \u2018Decriminalisation is the best form of regulation for sex workers\u2018\u201c. The advocates, meeting in Sydney in early November, mainly exchanged on their positive experiences in the Australian state of New South Wales, where sex work has been decriminalised since 1995. The article further finds that \u201ccurrently the only jurisdictions with decriminalised sex work are New Zealand and New South Wales. Both have been praised in relation to their sex work legislation internationally, including in the recent UN report into Sex work, HIV and the Law.\u201c, 6295=In a third case, on May 7 2012, police authorities in the Ugandan city of Gulu \u2018dropped by\u2019 a sex worker drop-in centre. They raided the small office and arrested two staff and three members of the Women\u2019s Organization Network for Human Rights Advocacy (WONETHA), a duly registered group that runs the centre. \u201cWe find this to be an attack on WONETHA and sex workers\u2019 freedom of association, assembly, speech and expression, and we strongly protest against this,\u201d said Macklean Kyomya, the group\u2019s executive director. Beyond the listed human rights, the raid also raises the question of digital security. One of the three members that was arrested recounts the raid: \u201cThey started searching our office in every corner including the dust bin. They connected the computer and asked me the password, and opened the emails we send to our office in Kampala. They asked me if we have a flash disk which I said we didn\u2019t\u2026 but we have a modem for our internet. They took it, along with papers, a printer, the cash book, a stapling machine, a puncher, a computer and a CPU\u201d.}",
