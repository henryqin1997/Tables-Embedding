While Lamont Library is not open to the public, outside researchers may use the Poetry Room, though they should contact the curator, Don Share, share@fas.harvard.edu, first. Colleen Bryant Lamont Library Reference Harvard College bryant4@fas.harvard.edu DOCOMOMO US notes that more information can be found here and that visitors should be aware that photography within Lamont is not allowed without the permission from the Office of the Librarian of Harvard College.
