He then contributed a crucial 85 in the 2007 World Cup win over Bangladesh and scored further centuries against Scotland, Bangladesh and England as Ireland continued to press for Full Membership of the ICC. He has led the senior side in both white-ball formats since 2008., 46272=He was signed by Gloucestershire on the back of his 2007 World Cup performances but left to join Warwickshire at the end of the 2010 season. While his form for Warwickshire has been modest - it took four years to register his first Championship century for the club and, going into the 2015 season, his first-class for the side remains below 30 - he has been a valuable member of the side that won the County Championship in 2012, the NatWest T20 Blast in 2014 and reached the final of the Royal London One-Day Cup that same season.
