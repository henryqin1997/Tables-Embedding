Turning now to FIGS. 5 and 6, it will be further seen that the components are sized such that when the rectangular blade 58 is fully inserted into the space 64 and the pen 12 being held is in its lowered position as depicted in FIG. 5, half of the sensing surface 44 is covered by the blade 58. When the pen 12 is raised as in FIG. 6, the sensing surface 44 is covered by the blade 58. Thus, the dual function sensing apparatus 32 operates as depicted in the graph of FIG. 7. With no pen 12 being held, the blade 58 is removed from the space 64 and the sensing surface 44 receives all the light from the source 40 and the signal output is a maximum. With a pen 12 being held in the lowered position, the blade 58 is in the space 64 and the sensing surface 44 receives only half the light from the source 40 (as depicted in FIG. 5) and the signal output is at one half its maximum level. With a pen 12 being held in the raised position, the blade 58",
