            "There are many campus safety staff roaming around the school, the only problem that i see is that anyone can come into the school regardless of whether they are a student or not because no one checks ID's or ask for any proof that you are a student.",
            "This school is great for students who work a full time job because they work with your schedule very well. It is also a good school for those with children because there is a daycare on campus. This school is awesome for anyone who is looking to create a better future for themselves.",
            "I took financial planning classes when i was in High School and it was recommended that i go to a community college to get my basic classes out of the way because it would be cheaper, my teacher was absolutely right, my financial aid covers all of my expenses!",
            "Chattanooga State is always holding events for the students to enjoy. We have had a few really exciting guests like the Dalai Lama who have come to speak for us. There are many clubs to choose from including math and science that will be helpful if you are taking those classes.",
            "I haven't tried the food in the cafeteria yet because its a bit pricey but it smells wonderful when i walk by.",
            "We do not currently offer dormitories at this location.",
            "Like all colleges you will have your good teachers as well as your bad. The best thing you can do for yourself is to take advantage of the tutoring that they offer and go to the library as often as possible so that you can keep up with your homework. Most teachers will work with you if you need the help.",
            "Going to college can be a scary thought. It takes motivation as well as courage to take the first step toward a better life. I was nervous about going back to school and wondered how i would ever have time, money or motivation to come in each day, but when i walk into these doors every day i see nothing but better opportunities for myself. My tip for prospective students is to take the first step toward a brighter future and join Chattanooga State Community College, they are here for you! I would suggest that students get to school early if they want to get a good parking space or a good seat in the library. At the beginning of each semester it is wise to come to school a day early so that you can easily find your classes.",
            "Chattanooga State is a great college that is both affordable and educational. Many of the lessons i learn here are helpful both inside and outside of school. I feel most comfortable in the Chattanooga State Library because it is a comfortable and peaceful environment for me to catch up on my studying."
