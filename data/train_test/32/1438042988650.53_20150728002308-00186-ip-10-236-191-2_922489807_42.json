            "Downtown Salem is about a 20 minute walk and there's bookstores, stores, cafes, and restaurants. There's also museums about Salem and it' history. It's never boring.",
            "The food is pretty good. You have quite a few options to choose from.",
            "The rooms and bathrooms aren't that bad as long as you clean up after yourself. You're neighbors can become your friends. Your whole floor can become friends.",
            "Do not slack off on your readings because they'll pile up and you'll end up having to read the whole book the night before the exam. Do what is due first. Do your work bit by bit and make sure to that you have enough time.",
            "Be friends with your professors because they're there to help you. Do not take morning classes if you are not a morning person and can avoid it at all costs. Even if you're shy, talk to someone you don't know because there's the chance that they could become you're best friend.",
            "Salem State University is a really good school. There is always something to do and somewhere to go and get all your work done. Everyone on campus are not judgmental and it's an overall good environment."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{167119=Salem has tons of sports teams and clubs to join which everyone should take advantage of. October is a great time to be at Salem State as well because Salem is known for their Halloween attractions. Salem is also close by lots of shopping like the Northshore Mall and the campus is fairly active with students hanging out all around., 193391=Downtown Salem! It's great (although busy and hard to drive) in October, there's the Peabody Essex Museum downtown, as well as a ton of haunted houses and other tourist attractions, and downtown is only a half an hour walk or you could take the free student shuttle., 213932=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 187529=Halloween is big here at Salem State University. It is a tourist zone during the entire month of October, after all it is known as the town of the witches., 115303=Salem is known for Halloween, and October is the busiest time of year here. There are great costume parties all around the area that I would highly reccommenf. Even walking downtown is a sight to see!, 153158=DEFINITELY go down town! Especially in October, the whole month is one big halloween-fest and there are people literally from all over the world. There are always tons of things to do downtown and the campus is actually pretty good about coming up with activities and events for students as well., 10023=One of the biggest things that drew me to Salem State was it's price and very richly awarding financial aid. The school is fairly cheap for a state school and isn't going to run you into the ground with hundreds of thousands dollars in debt when you graduate. The financial aid packages are very large as long as you apply for them on time, and I personally only have had to pay a maximum of 600 a semester from my own pocket. Considering that the staff is very helpful and the atmosphere of the campus is so nice and friendly, I find that this school is really a bang for the buck. They also have the 'Rent-A-Text' program with their school books, so a majority of your books you can rent so you're not paying $1000 and up every semester for books alone. The only complaint I have is that, at least in Peabody Hall (a freshmen dormitory), some of the Resident Assistants are very unhelpful when you need help with a problem you're having and it's very difficult to get to the right people if you're having a situation with your room mate that needs to be handled by one of the authorities of the building. Also, there has been constant construction going on right outside of Peabody Hall so if you're in Peabody, you're usually woken up at seven in the morning by loud, headache-inducing jack hammering outside of your window. The only other problem is that the campuses are far away from each other. If you're a freshman, you will be on North Campus in either Peabody or Bowditch hall, and if you get classes on South Campus - that's a good 15 to 20 minute walk away which seems even longer in the freezing cold/rain. Salem State offers shuttle services to get between North, Central, and South campuses but they are not anywhere near 100% reliable and sometimes you'll be out waiting for a shuttle for over a half hour and end up late to your class because the shuttle took forever to show up., 31424=Downtown Salem is of course fun in October but is fun all year. There are great restaurants and fun shops. The North Shore Mall is close by, and Boston is just a twenty minute ride on the commuter rail away. The school has events and parties all the time as long as you look you can find things to do., 68360=The campus is supposed to be dry and smoke free, however the rules say you may smoke or drink somewhere off campus. There is a bike path that runs through the center of campus, but is owned by the time, so everyone goes there to hang out, take a walk, or do these substances. Also when Halloween rolls around, the town celebrates throughout the month of October.}",
