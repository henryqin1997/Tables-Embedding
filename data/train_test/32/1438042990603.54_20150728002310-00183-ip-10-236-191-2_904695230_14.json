            "The campus safety is excellent, and there are lights all around campus. The neighborhood around campus is safe during the day, although students should use caution at night, like in any city.",
            "There are a variety of clubs, including clubs for specific majors, and the Activities Board of Student Government plans activities throughout the year. There is always something going on, and some fun event in which students can be involved.",
            "Great for any student that is motivated to learn and make the most of their college experience!",
            "As a private school, the tuition is costly, but the quality of the experience here is worth it. The academics prepare students for future careers and the professors invest in students to an incredible degree. The chapels help students grow spiritually, and even in classrooms, Evangel is all about preparing students to live out God's call on their lives in any field or major.",
            "On campus, students hang out in the student union. In warm weather, there are almost always students playing volleyball on the outdoor court, and this year a Frisbee golf course was installed. Local coffee shops are some of the most popular places where students spend time hanging out. There is also a movie theatre, a dollar movie theatre, many parks, a downtown area, many restaurants, ice cream shops, and other things to do for fun off campus.",
            "The cafeteria provides many options, including many healthy choice foods. There is also a food court that is a great alternative. While students sometimes complain, the food service here is relatively very good compared to many other colleges. In addition, this summer, the cafeteria and food court are being remodeled!",
            "The community at Evangel is amazing, and the dorms provide an excellent chance to part of that close community. Rooms are shared between two people, with every two rooms having their own bathroom.",
            "The academics at Evangel are rigorous, and there are high expectations in every major, although expectations of specific professors vary. The academic programs at Evangel are praised locally for their excellent quality and recognized around the country.",
            "Come expecting to be challenged both academically and spiritually. The environment here at Evangel is one in which you will grow in so many ways. Take advantage of the many opportunities.",
            "Evangel University engages students in a high quality education with a full range of major options and numerous opportunities outside of the classroom to enhance learning. The student body hails from around the country and around the world, which allows for a variety of perspectives. The professors are experts in their fields, and they care about their students."

They are nice with the option of having your own room for a fee of course. They are suite styles with one bath. So, two bedrooms with a bath and shower in between that they share. There is no kitchen area, but most people eat in the Cafeteria. It's a great place to build relationships and meet new life long relationships.}",
