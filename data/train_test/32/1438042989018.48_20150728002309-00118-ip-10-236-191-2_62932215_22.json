Four were made at an average rate of 3 hrs. 45 m. The longer axis of the oval, described by the extreme tip, was directed at right angles to the line joining the opposite leaves; its length was in one case only 13/8, and in another case 16/8 inch; so that the young leaves were moved a very short distance. The shoots of the same plant observed in midsummer, when growing not so quickly, did not revolve at all. I cut down another plant in the early summer, so that by August 1st it had formed new and moderately vigorous shoots; these, when observed under a bell-glass, were on some days quite stationary, and on other day moved to and fro only about the eighth of an inch. Consequently the revolving power is much enfeebled in this species, and under unfavourable circumstances is completely lost. The shoot must depend for coming into contact with surrounding objects on the probable, though not ascertained spontaneous movement of the leaves, on rapid growth, and on movement from the wind. Hence, perhaps, it is that the petioles have acquired a high degree of sensitiveness as a compensation for the little power of movement in the shoots., 459277=SCHLIEMANN (DR. HENRY).

He further remarks that plants growing beneath other and taller species or trees, are naturally those which would be developed into climbers; and such plants, from stretching towards the light and from not being much agitated by the wind, tend to produce long, thin and flexible shoots., 467125=SMITH'S (DR.

He has observed that the strong summer shoots of the Michigan rose (Rosa setigera) are strongly disposed to push into dark crevices and away from the light, so that they would be almost sure to place themselves under a trellis. He adds that the lateral shoots, made on the following spring, emerged from the trellis as they sought the light., 380993=\u2014 1871 to 1873. 5s., 436772=KING EDWARD VITH's Latin Grammar. 12mo. 3s. 6d., 353544=* Quoted by Cohn, in his remarkable memoir, \"Contractile Gewebe in Pflanzenreiche,\" 'Ab-handl. der Schlesischen Gesell. 1861, Heft i. s. 35., 67648=Plumbago rosea (Plumbaginace\u00e6) follows the sun.

These plants are arranged according to Lindley's 'Vegetable Kingdom' of 1853; and they have been selected from When a free shoot has grown far beyond its support, it sinks downwards from its weight, as already explained in the case of the Hop, with the revolving extremity turned upwards. If the support be not lofty, the shoot falls to the ground, and resting there, the extremity rises up. Sometimes several shoots, when flexible, twine together into a cable, and thus support one another. Single thin depending shoots, such as those of the Sollya Drummondii, will turn abruptly backwards and wind up on themselves. The greater number of the depending shoots, however, of one twining plant, the Hibbertia dentata, showed but little tendency to turn upwards. In other cases, as with the Cryptostegia grandiflora, several internodes which were at first flexible and revolved, if they did not succeed in twining round a support, become quite rigid, and supporting themselves upright, carried on their summits the younger revolving internodes. not wind round it. This apparently was due to the flexure of the shoot,",
