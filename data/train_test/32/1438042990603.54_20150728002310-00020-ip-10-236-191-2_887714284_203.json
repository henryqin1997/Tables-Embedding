            "While Los Angeles isn't associated with being the safest city in America, CSUN's location in the San Fernando Valley's suburbs make it an ideal location. You are far away from the worries of city life and numerous students take classes into the late night. If you should require extra assistance walking to your car at night CSUN has a Matador Patrol Program. All you do is call a phone number, let them know your location and within minutes someone arrives to escort you to your car. The Patrol members are trained in the art of conversation and you can often times end up making a new contact!",
            "I am a member of a greek organization and it has been one of the best decisions I have made during my collegiate experience. The community supports Greek life and the campus faculty attend our fundraisers and philanthropy events to show support!",
            "There is a club or organization for everything from Long Boarders to Greek Life to Business Law Organization. The campus makes it simple to start a club of your own and give you resources and outlets for promoting your club. If you are visiting campus stop by the Matador Involvement Center and ask to see a list of clubs!",
            "If you are pursing a career in fine arts and don't want to go into debt for a private school education CSUN is the way to go! The facilities, faculty and program structure rival that of the surrounding private schools such as Cal Arts, Otis, and Art Institute. Your faculty are contemporary artists who are showing work at the museums you visit and have real world experience in the art industry. They are connected and want to see you succeed! The value of education I have received for the amount of money I have payed has been unbelievable. I am ready and prepared for a career as an artist.",
            "While CSUN is known as a commuter campus it is alive and thriving. Matador Spirit has been encouraged throughout the campus by various activities. At any given day you can walk through campus and get lunch for free at a campus activity such as In-n-out, Menchies, and Hot Dog on a Stick!",
            "Los Angeles can be fairly expensive to live in, your location will determine how much you pay in rent. You can save money by shopping it local farmer markets instead of at big name brand supermarkets.",
            "CSUN is located approximately 45 minutes from most things in Los Angeles. You can hop onto the 405 into the West Side to spend a day at the beach at the Santa Monica pier or at the Venice Boardwalk. You could drive on over to Studio City for unique dining and thrift store shopping. Over in Hollywood you can experience Los Angeles like a true tourist along the Hollywood Walk of Fame or at the Chinese Theater. If you are into Art you could go to any of the internationally recognized museums such as Los Angles County Museum of Art (LACMA), Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA), or to Bergamont Station for free exhibits. Artists with international fame show in Los Angeles year around and these museums are a great opportunity to get close to work you may never have the chance to see again! If being indoors isn't for you there are hundreds, yes hundreds, of hiking trails throughout the canyons, you can even hike up to the famous Hollywood sign. There is plenty to do in Los Angeles no matter what you're interests are!",
            "CSUN has just redone the dining hall, now named Geronimos. There is a full service salad bar and sandwich bar. There is also fruit, cereal and other snacks availability during all meals. The hot meals change between breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They switch it up between Mexican, Chinese and Italian food so there is always variety!",
            "If you are a first time freshman the Freshman Dorms are the way to go! They are traditionally styled, 2 roommates per room, while they are small it's all apart of the experience. You only sleep and do homework in your room otherwise you are outside or in common areas hanging out with friends. The apartment style dorms get a lot of complaints because they are difficult to make new friends in.",
            "Like most things in life you will only get out of college what you put into it. The faculty want to see you succeed however, if you don't care about your education then the faculty won't either. The campus is huge and you must be driven and motivated to learn.",
            "Don't be afraid to meet with your teacher outside of office hours for further help. The courses that were the toughest for me I always passed because I wasn't afraid to make appointments with my teachers, ask for their recommendations for tutors, and to spend the extra time I needed.",
            "CSUN is a campus that is committed to cultivating school spirit and values higher education. The faculty encourage you to constantly push yourself and test your limits. There are numerous ways to get involved on campus and since CSUN is a commuter school, lots of students are involved."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{136352=I highly recommend the dorms to the newly incoming freshmen so they can start many new people and have a great sense of community within the dorm life. Also there is events sponsors by the RA (Residental Advisor) with free movie screenings, ice cream parties, and even peer advisement. For exercise, their are volleyball nets, a small field for soccer, and basketball courts. The only downside is that the Matador Patrol closes the gates at 7:30 pm so if you need to enter to the dorms, you have to sign and verify with matador patrol before you enter., 1103142=As an Alumni, class of 2012, i really took advantage of all the opportunities that were offered to me in the School of Sociology. The professors are great and really allow you to learn skills that are practiced in the classroom so that you can immediately start using in the workforce. Professor Morgaine, Hatkoff, and Debose were my mentors, teachers, life coaches, and friends., 56915=I love CSUN,but if I were living on campus I would have a lot more fun.The sports are fun and it is easy to get involved with activities.The campus is beautiful and they are building a new Art center which is suppose to open in 2011.I also love the library because I always can find what I am looking for in there if I can't find it at my local library., 675507=I don't dorm, but I do live across the dorms, there is a curfew for getting inside without having to be checked in, they close the gates at 7:30. Also they are fairly overpriced, but I do still wish I dormed to meet new people., 235458=there are many fun events held at c.su.n. such as concerts by well known artists like b.o.b. and the cataracs, who performed in the fall semester, 2011. they recently built the student recreational center where students can become fit and active. best part it is free for students! during the hot weathers c.s.u.n. has a big pool where students can cool off., 75282=Great school. May not have the prestige of other schools like the UCs but it is one of the best CSUs in the state and has a great business program., 874348=I had no fun time. I tranferred in 2006 Fall semester from Mission College and I Graduated from CSUN in Spring 2008. My goal was to complete my BA as soon as possible because I was having a baby in Sep 2008. I had no time to see or do fun things at school... but study,go to class and take exams., 740882=I've been a student majoring in Civil Engineering here at Cal State Northridge since the Fall of 2007. I have seen the campus grow with student life and expand. CSUN has just finished building a new student recreation center, parking structures, updated technology in classrooms, and improved student life on campus. Overall I have enjoyed my years here and despite the large majority of peers commuting to and from, the student body can connect on campus. Go Matadors!, 714536=CSUN has an entire escort system that guards the library and personally approaches students to walk them either to their car or back to the dorms. Security guards have two shacks on the outskirts of Student Housing and patrol from 7:30 pm- 3:00 am. The guards are pretty cool, they actually like chatting with students and asking what's going on with them. They also patrol inside of Student Housing too., 597215=They are not acceptng new applicants until 2013., 739714=CSUN has updated their dormitory life since 2007 and provided better meals for on campus dining., 122576=This year 2012 the hired various security! Its really good., 987137=It`s no wonder than CSUN is ranked 68th in the 2013 edition of Best Colleges is Regional Universities (West) by US News. This school offers incredibly small class sizes which are ideal for getting the best of lecture time. CSUN`s vast variety of degree programs ensures than just about anyone can attend CSUN and study what he or she wishes.}",
