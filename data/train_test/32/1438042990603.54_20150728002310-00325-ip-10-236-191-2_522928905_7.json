These shares were sold in a series of transactions at an average sales price of $32.1016 per share. Each performance based restricted share represents a contingent right to receive one share of CYH common stock. There are two elements to the lapsing of the restriction; first, the Company must achieve specified targeted amount of earnings per share from continuing operations, or net revenue from continuing operations, and if the performance objective is met, the vesting restrictions will lapse in 1/3 increments on the first, second and third anniversary of the date of grant. If the objectives are not met, the shares will be forfeited.
