During September 2013, the nation is drawing attention to the effects of childhood obesity on physical and emotional health, health care costs, and national productivity. \u00a0 In its special collection, \u201cObesity Prevention at the IOM,\u201d the Institute of Medicine (IOM) highlights key scientific findings and policy recommendations to address this important issue. These resources include a video based on the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, Educating the Student Body: Taking Physical Activity and Physical Education to School, an interactive infographic titled \u201cObesity: Complex But Conquerable,\u201d and many other resources. \u00a0 The Koshland Science Museum\u2019s online exhibit \u201cFood for Thought\u201d explores healthy eating, supplements, and more. \u00a0In our School Lunches game, try your hand at applying USDA dietary guidelines by planning a nutritious lunch for a high school cafeteria\u2014and make sure your \u201cstudents\u201d eat it!}",
