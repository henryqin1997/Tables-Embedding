When a title is obtained, the stats received from it are permanently added to the character. Thus, which title is displayed at a given time does not affect the character's attributes (i.e. A player can display the Beginner Spirit Investigator title and still receive the +1 STR from the Neck Grabber title.) Titles often provide bonuses to stats related to the requirements. A title can be equipped and shown above a character's name, visible to all other players. Titles are rewards for specific accomplishments in-game, obtained by completing stories and battles, defeating enemies, collecting items, or participating in events.
