The highly talented midfielder though primarily left footed Pedersen began his career right footed! He successfully converted himself in his early teens, beginning his career in his native Norway in 2000 with Tromso. His potential was noticed by a number of Premiership clubs including Manchester United, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur, however it would be Blackburn Rovers who won his signature as Graeme Souness captured the Norwegians signature for a fee of around \u00a32 million ahead of the 2004-2005 season. Upon Mark Hughes' arrival Pedersen found himself out of the team and found opportunities hard to come across. Eventually his chance came early in 2005 and he took this with both hands going on a goal scoring eventually ending the season a Rovers' second top goalscorer that season. A regular in the starting XI and a key member to Rovers success during the 2005-2006 season. His magic wand of a left foot has seen him score a large number of high quality goals for both club and country. A new contract was signed in the summer of 2006 to fend off unwanted advances from others. Along with his Norwegian International team mates Freddy dos Santos, Raymond Kvisvik, Oyvind Svenning and Kristofer Haestad he embarked on a new project\u0085 forming his boy band named The Players releasing their debut single also in the summer of 2006 entitled this is for real. His footballing skills are far superior to his musical talents however.
