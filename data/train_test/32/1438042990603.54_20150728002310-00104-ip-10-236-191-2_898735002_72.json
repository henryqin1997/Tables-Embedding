            "SIUE is ranked in the top 50 US Safest Colleges, and boy does it deserve it! Our university offers lighted paths with security poles, as well as security escorts. The university police are very reliable and are all about student safety!",
            "SIUE has a growing Greek life. Our Greek life offers a brother or sisterhood that will change your life forever. While the Greek life is very oriented in keeping their GPA's, they also enjoy having their fun. Our Greek life is much more of a family!",
            "SIUE offers students the opportunities to be apart of club sports who travel to other schools to compete without requiring the dedication and time of our Division 1 athletes. SIUE offers many different clubs from biology club to the sky diving club.",
            "SIUE is perfect for any kind of student. If you're all about academics and nothing else, SIUE offers you the opportunity to study and graduate with a number of degrees. If you're looking to have fun and be involved on campus, there are endless options for you to explore.",
            "SIUE is a beautiful campus surrounded woods. The deer, geese, and other wild life are in abundance on campus. Running/Walking/Bike trails wind throughout the campus and further their way through the county.",
            "SIUE is by far the best bang for your buck. I have yet to find a university for a better deal. The university offers a wide variety of majors/minors for a very affordable price. If money is a problem, and you're determined to go to school at SIUE, the financial aide office is all about helping students out!",
            "SIUE offers students the opportunities to participate in Division 1 sports, intramural, clubs, and other social groups. If you're interested in promoting gun control and having fun at the same time, then the Trap and Skeet Club is for you! There are also clubs associated with majors, I personally am a member of the Student Nurses Association on campus.",
            "There are endless opportunities in the dining hall. There are options for just about every kind of diet there is, from healthy, to fast food, we've got it!",
            "The dorm life at SIUE is very welcoming. Social events are held very often to get new freshmen associated with one another. There are many different clubs as well for students to become associated with.",
            "Classes at SIUE are challenging, but they are nothing too rigorous for students to handle. While the courses can be challenging there is a wonderful team of experts willing to help. Tutoring is available, and professors are always willing to take the extra time to make sure their students are on track.",
            "Don't turn the school down because you've heard it's not a party scene. While social events off campus are common, SIUE is more known for its academics. Besides isn't that why you're paying to go to college? SIUE is well worth a visit. If you're wanting to go to school in the state of Illinois be sure to schedule a visit. SIUE is a very affordable university in which the opportunities are endless. Trust me, once you've visited the campus, you'll fall in love!",
            "SIUE has a beautiful campus that allows students to get the feel for the city, but at the same time have a small town vibe. It is a campus full of never ending opportunities to stay involved on campus in almost anything you could imagine. The education aspect of the school is outstanding, and if help is needed in any area, help can be found right around the corner."

I have lived in housing for both my years here and I love it. The Resident Assistants are wonderful and help when you need them. Am learning a lot Classes here at SIUe are challenging. However SIUe is a great place to learn outside of the classroom. Your instructors and professors make it a priority to teach you what you need to know and help get real-life, hands-on experience.
