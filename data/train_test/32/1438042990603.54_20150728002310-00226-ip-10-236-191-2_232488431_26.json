When elements are listed in order according to the number of protons (called the atomic number), repeating patterns of physical and chemical properties identify families of elements with similar properties. This 'Periodic Table' is a consequence of the repeating pattern of outermost electrons and their permitted energies. 178 B (9-12) outer, pattern, representation, spatialization Bonds between atoms are created when electrons are paired up by being transferred or shared. A substance composed of a single kind of atom is called an element. The atoms may be bonded together into molecules or crystalline solids. A compound is formed when two or more kinds of atoms bind together chemically. 179 B (9-12) atom, atomicity, bond, composition, crystalline, interaction, pairing The physical properties of compounds reflect the nature of the interactions among its molecules. These interactions are determined by the structure of the molecule, including the constituent atoms and the distances and angles between them. 179 B (9-12) angle, composition, distance, interaction, spatial interaction, structure Solids, liquids, and gases differ in the distances and angles between molecules or atoms and therefore the energy that binds them together. In solids the structure is nearly rigid; in liquids molecules or atoms move around each",
