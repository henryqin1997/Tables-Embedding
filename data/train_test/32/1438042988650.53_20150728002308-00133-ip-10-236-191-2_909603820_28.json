            "Campus safety is always on top of things. I have heard of very few criminal acts occurring.",
            "I don't participate in Greek Life.",
            "There is a club for everything just about and if there isn't it's easy to make one and get it approved.",
            "There is a wide variety of students on campus so there is always plenty to do for everyone.",
            "I feel UMaine is well priced for the academics you receive. But you are charged for using the Rec. and Fitness center based on the amounts of credits you take versus the amount of time you spend there.",
            "There is always a ton of stuff to do for excitement and fun. Plenty of clubs and organizations to join and almost always a show or something going on every month.",
            "I have eaten in the Marketplace at the Union and the food there is varied and tasty. I love the wraps. However, the breakfast over to Hilltop wasn't as good as I was hoping.",
            "I don't personally live in the dorms, I live off-campus. However, I have heard that living in the dorm is laid-back and a fun atmosphere.",
            "Some classes are easier than others but overall the classes are time demanding and academically strong.",
            "Be prepared for large lecture halls with hundreds of students at one time. Don't be scared to ask the professor for help when you don't understand a concept. Get involved in school activities such as clubs, sports, or organizations.",
            "Umaine is fast-paced and challenging in their academics. The staff is friendly, willing to take time to help you, and care about your needs. The atmosphere is exciting with plenty going on so that you are never bored."

Rumble on the Hill (various competitions between dorms). Healthy High 5k (Run/walk on April 20th at 4:20 PM)., 9009=There is over 900 student in greek life on campus, 8 men\u2019s fraternities or 7 women\u2019s sororities. Greek life has been at UMaine since 1874 and is a big part of the school and to those who want to be involved in it. For many students it enhances there time here at UMaine and it is a great community. They support academic support/excellence, and show leadership in the community. Greek life can either be apart of your experience here at UMaine, or it does't have to be at all, it is up to the student. But greek life for many students here is a great experience., 419040=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 352333=There is a police station on campus with safety boxes everywhere. I have never felt unsafe. I have a job on campus and get out around 12:00AM. There are always student walking around and the campus police make themselves noticed - not in a negative way., 139551=I will be starting classes in the fall of 2012 but I believe the University of Maine has a wonderful reputation for their degrees they offer. I'm extremely excited to begin my college education here and experience their beautiful campus. Not only do I believe their campus and degrees are very high quality, I have heard they are always there for you. I know I am not going to be alone through my college process, all the professors and staff are they 100% to make sure everyone is getting through college as smoothly as possible., 373407=It's nice from September to mid October, then starts to get nice again in May, right before the end of the year. All the time, everyday in between, it's a dark, gray, very very cold world. A big party school, probably because drinking alcohol makes you not feel the frigid winter chill.}",

All you have to do is push the button and the campus police will come for you. RA's give the student the campus police number so if they need to call. The campus is really safe overall. Greek Life",
