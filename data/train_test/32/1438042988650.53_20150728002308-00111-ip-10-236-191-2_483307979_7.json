Since encapsulation results in the original IP packet 44 being hidden or included inside a PPP datagram 48, the IP header of the tunnel mode protected packet 46 provides the necessary routing information, enabling the packet 44 to travel through the communication network 12 without revealing the final destination stored in the original IP packet header. Once the encapsulated IP packets 44 reach their destination, the encapsulation header is removed and the original IP packet header is used to route the packet to its final destination. . The PPP datagram 42 includes the following frame fields: a flag field which indicates the beginning or end of a frame and consists of the binary sequence, an address field, a control field, a protocol field to identify the protocol encapsulated in the data field of the frame, a data field that contains the datagram for the protocol specified in the protocol field and a frame check sequence (FCS) for error detection. The process starts with step 100 where a byte stream in the form of a plurality of PPP datagrams 42 is intercepted en route along the protocol stack",
