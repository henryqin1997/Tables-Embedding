Still got 50 miles for the day, and my first long mixter ride for 2011. Happy to report that, overall, the collarbone was happy, even with all the bumps and the (humongous, according to Gino) weight of my Camelbak! 8am to 3:30pm or thereabouts. photos",

Rode across the GGB, up Conzelman, down Coastal, up Miwok, Old Springs Trail, down to Tennessee Valley, then back up Marincello, connect to Bobcat, to Rodeo Valley, back up Coastal, down Conzelman, back across the GGB, and back home. I'm guessing about 35-40 miles total. Bike worked fairly well. New handlebars are good in terms of reach and height, but are too wide. Rear shifting is still wonky in the large chainring. Bike still shimmies, even with the new fork, too. photos",

Near the top, we also bumped into Carlos and Greg. We descended down towards Mountain House Inn, and those four decided to head back to Mill Valley, while Esteban, Aaron, and I continued on towards Mt. Tam. Was quite foggy and drizzly as we climbed Tam and traversed the Seven Sisters into Alpine Dam, and we got pretty wet. I, of course, waited too long to don my raingear. The drizzle let up as we reached Alpine Lake, and by the time we were in Fairfax it was gone. We stopped at the Roastery for coffee and eats before slogging back home. 8:30am to 5pm."
