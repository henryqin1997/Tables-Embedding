            "You're in downtown Salt Lake! There are two huge malls that you can visit anytime. There are movie theaters, dances all the time, temple square is beautiful year round, not to mention skiing and snowboarding in the winter. It's an awesome place to run and hike because you're surrounded by mountains. Every Tuesday at 11:20 there is a devotional at the Assembly Hall and they're really great to go to and hear the speakers.",
            "The Carriage Cafe here is super good. The food is really fresh and pretty dang cheap. I don't have a meal plan, so I can't tell you how much that is, but a lot of people say it's definitely worth it.",

            "Not extremely hard homework loads or classes, but the teachers expect your best. Group projects are heavily weighted in all classes, so make sure you can work with others. Also, depending on the teachers, most are very understanding about assignments if you go in and talk to them, so just make sure you become good friends with your teachers!",
            "Look into the programs!!! I came here as Undecided and now that my semester is over, I know which program I want to go int, but I wish I could have been in it from the beginning of the semester.",
            "This school is extremely organized and not too difficult in terms of homework load, depending on your program. The teachers really know what they are talking about, and they try to make the concepts and lessons personal so that you can understand them better by applying it to your own life. It is a religious school, and every class begins with a prayer, but everyone around you has amazing standards and will help you with ANYTHING."

    "textAfterTable": "Allison from Adamstown, MD 07/02/2011 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon. Reviewer has been to campus. 4 out of 4 people found this review useful. 2 of 38 Categories Comments Great for these types of students This college is for people who want to be surrounded with other people who have high values/standards and who want marketable skills. My admissions counselor told me that it's also a good place for people who don't necessarily know what they want to do yet--a good place to find yourself. Tips for prospective students 1) Make your essays original/creative when you apply. 2) Make sure you know what you want from your college experience before you make a final decision. 3) Take initiative to call/e-mail the school and find out everything you can! Bang for the buck The tuition is such a great price compared to pretty much every other college. There are lots of colleges whose tuition is $10,000 or more per semester! However, at LDSBC, the tuition is less than $5,000",
