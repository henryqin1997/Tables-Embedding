Everything revolves and around meal plan, which happens three times a day: 730-930, 11-130, and 430 - 730 during the weekday, and 1030-130 and 430-630 on the weekends. You have the big caf\u00c3\u00a9 and small caf\u00c3\u00a9 (close from Friday evening -sun), the small caf\u00c3\u00a9, the student center (chic-fil-a, tropical smoothie, and pizza hut), Spartan Station (burgers, burritos, and subs) and the Bodega which doesn't have meal plan, but is perfect for late night dining when you have dining dollars have Spartan bucks. After awhile it gets old and you'll be begging your parents for money to eat off campus.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Norfolk State University is great for students who want to get a headstart in the world. This institution breeds leaders and develops positive, hard-working, contributing members of society. NSU is known for its excellent Nursing Program and its nationally renowned Music Program. This university is for students who want to learn in a well-rounded, student-friendly, family-oriented environment. It is great for students who stand out amongst their peers and would like to continue making their mark on the world. Tips for prospective students My biggest suggestion for new freshmen entering college would be not to underestimate college life. When most people tell you about college, they only tell you the good stuff. They tell you about the parties, the staying-up-late, the long weekends, but they fail to tell you about the hours of commitment to studying it takes to pass classes. In return, a lot of students enter college life unprepared for the work load. Also, come prepared to be your own person and live your own life. Your parents can no longer wake you up in the morning or call your teachers to discuss your grades. When you step onto a college campus, the responsibility is placed in your hands and it is up to you to make the most of your higher learning experience. Bang for the buck",
