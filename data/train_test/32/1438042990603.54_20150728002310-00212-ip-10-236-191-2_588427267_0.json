It's little wonder, then, that the slick, intuitive Yahoo! Weather utility tops the iPhone Qi app chart for April. Speaking of Yahoo!, down at #5 we have Flickring for Flickr, an unofficial but full-featured client for The Big Y's online photo service. Everypost takes the #6 slot, meanwhile, with its all-inclusive social network-sharing abilities. This app enables you to share content on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Google+, and Tumblr simultaneously. Further down the leaderboard, we have NutriAid.
