    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{26595=Another less expensive means of insuring a minimal level of oxygen in a meat package is to use a gas flush MAP process. The complicated steps of evacuating the package and refilling with the desired gas mixture are eliminated. The outer bag (a barrier layer), is simply flushed with the proper gas mixture as it is formed around the inner container. The flush process reduces the oxygen content of the package to about two percent. An oxygen scavenger is placed in the package to absorb additional oxygen just prior to or simultaneously with forming and flushing the outer bag. An excellent example of such a MAP system is described in the patent application entitled \u201cModified Atmosphere Package\u201d filed on Apr. 3, 1996, and given Ser. No. 08/627,137., 22116=The present application claims priority to Provisional U.S. patent application Ser. No. 60/108,315, filed Nov. 13, 1998, which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 08/856,448 filed May 14, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,928,560, issued on Jul. 27, 1999, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/700,644, filed Aug. 8, 1996, now abandoned., 45412=As shown in FIG. 10, acetic acid, commonly known as vinegar acid, works particularly well in accelerating the rate of oxygen absorption of an MRM oxygen scavenger packet. Specifically, the injection of 0.5 ml. of acetic acid into each of two absorber packets reduces the amount of oxygen in a quart jar to approximately 0.1% O2 (1000 PPM) in one hour. As shown in FIG. 11, the percent O2 is reduced to approximately 0.04% O2 (400 PPM) in about ninety minutes when 0.5 ml. of acetic acid is injected into each of two MRM 100 scavenger packets. Two conclusions can be drawn from the data in FIGS. 10 and 11. First, injected acetic acid seems to work better than plain water in increasing the rate of oxygen absorption of an absorber packet. Second, from FIG. 10, 0.5 ml. acetic acid appears to work particularly well in increasing the rate and total amount of oxygen absorption. In the experiments resulting in the data in FIGS. 10 and 11, the starting level of oxygen in the jars was 2.0%, simulating the amount of oxygen which would be present after the gas flush step of a gas flush MAP process. Also, the experiments were performed under refrigeration.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes While the present invention has been described with reference to one or more particular embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that many changes may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Each of these embodiments and obvious variations thereof is contemplated as falling within the spirit and scope of the claimed invention, which is set forth in the following claims. The retail cut of raw meat 50 within the package 40 takes on a purple-red color when the oxygen is removed from the interior of the package 40. The meat-filled modified atmosphere package 40 may now be stored in a refrigeration unit for several weeks prior to being offered for sale at a grocery store. A short time (e.g., less than one hour) prior to being displayed at the grocery store, the inner container 44 is removed from the outer container 42 to allow oxygen from the ambient environment to permeate the non-barrier tray 46 and non-barrier cover 48. The purple-red color of the raw meat 50 quickly changes or \u201cblooms\u201d to a generally acceptable bright red color when the raw meat 50 is oxygenated by exposure to air. After a time period of about ninety minutes, the oxygen scavenging packet 52 lowers the oxygen level in the bag from its initial level of oxygen to less than about 0.04 percent or 400 PPM and most",
