            "I am nervous to walk around campus at night alone, so I make sure to always have a buddy with me although if anything does happen the campus does send out alerts to everyone's email and you can have your phone sent up to have campus alerts sent directly to you in a text.",
            "I decided to get involved in Greek life my first semester and I am so glad I did. Joining Greek life gave me a huge support system on campus. I am confident that my now sisters are going to be my life long friends.",
            "There are some many different clubs and activities to get involved in on campus; there is something for everyone.",
            "Something that is great for dance major/minor students is attending as many master classes as you can. The master classes expose you to different styles of movement and different ways of teaching.",
            "There are four tradition that every Slippery Rock student knows of: rubbing the rocks for good luck, saying hi to any student in passing, wearing your green and white on Fridays, and knowing are alma mater.",
            "There are often events on campus that are super fun to do and way cheap for students. Last semester All Time Low performed on campus and the tickets were only $15! I recently just bought a ticket to see stars from MTV's hit show Girl Code for only $2; the prices are unbeatable.",
            "For fun I like to go to the student center and see the free movies that are shown every week, and I go to the football games and seeing the marching band perform. I am also am in a sorority, so when I am looking for a good time I usually get together with my sister. Other than that I joined a dance team and I really enjoy performing at the basketball games for fun.",
            "All the places that accept flex always having something good; however, the food at the dining hall has its good days and bad days as long as you look around though you can usually find something good to eat. The main problem I have with the dining hall is the guest swipe procedure. As a student you get 5 guest swipes a semester, but if you have left over guest swipes during the week you are not aloud to use them on guests. I feel that you pay for all your meal swipes so you should be aloud to use them however you want.",
            "I live in a dorm, but I feel like I have my own apartment. My dorm room is shared with four people and it has 2 bedrooms, 2 bathroom, a living room, and kitchen area. The area is very spacious and feels like a home to me. Additionally, I am part of the Humanities and Fine Arts living learning community which made it super easy to make friends and gave me full time access to the dance studio in the building so I can rehearse whenever I please.",
            "I am a freshman dance majors and have already seen vast improvements from my start at Slippery Rock. The department also has many activities to help you grow outside of class, for example you are provided with master classes from various guest artists, dance teams, and auditions to get involved in performing different dance pieces each semester.",
            "Something I highly suggest is getting involved with groups on campus, such as the outdoor adventure club or a sorority/fraternity. Also, I began my first semester with more meal swipes than flex, but your more likely to find foods you like at the places that accept flex, so I suggest investing in a meal plan with more flex.",
            "Slippery Rock University is a very welcoming and friendly campus. You will meet teachers and have academic advisors looking out for your best interest even if you choose to switch your career plan. There are also lots of fun extra curricular activities for students to get involved in making it easy to find quality friends that share the same interests as you."

One nice thing about this school is that all of your courses relate in some way. I found myself learning the same concepts, from different perspectives which will help me when I become a teacher., 52924=if you are able to get some college credit courses while in high school, do some sincere community service. if you want to save money wait til may or july to see about getting a new lap top or computer. if they want to offer you to buy microsoft office tell them no thanks. this is why go to microsoft's website and go to their student specials or student section and you can download the full office suite for the special student price also check with your school to see if they have a deal on the office suite, i got mine for a licensed copy from slippery rock university where i am attending classes. if you happen to have a job find out if they offer a scholarship or a grant so ask your managers and research online for the company. bug the heck out of your advisor at your high school, your teachers and anyone else you can think of, you just might get lucky, so be ready to come to sru and get a life experience and make friends for life. good luck, 12538=I'm not a current student at slippery rock yet, but i will be in the fall of 2010 once i transfer there I can tell you more, from what i hear they have great major programs, clubs and organizations that you can get involved in, a small enjoyable town that there's places you can enjoy and other great adventures., 42856=There are many places to eat around campus including Boozel Dining Hall, Rockey's Grill, and new places are being built for the 2012 spring semester. All food is very good., 356936=A lot of event go on oncampus. Many people come for appearances like comedians, tv stars, etc. I met Ross Matthews, Ralphi May, Nev, and others., 533701=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 41449=Slippery Rock has a green and white friday every friday where students wear green and white. Also, during finals week there is breakfast at 11:00 pm at the dining hall where students can relax, dance, and have fun before the stressful week begins.}",

Reviewer has been to campus. 4 out of 6 people found this review useful. 3 of 112 Categories Comments Great for these types of students I looked into slippery rock because its close to home, they have a learning support program for students to get help for their learning disabilitys, there aren't that many colleges that have these type of programs and I myself have a learning disability, I happen to know someone who went here and they said their expeirence from the learning support staff was excellent.
