The Face is starting to use the rest of his body., 230339=Here is a note on Halladay from before today's game. Makes you wonder about Stras' shoulder, because he hasn't had his good fastball either recently. If the Phillies were ranking their top five biggest worries, Roy Halladay probably wouldn't make the list. Still, after watching him Tuesday against Washington, one scout said: \"I've never, ever seen him pitch like that \u2014 not since the Blue Jays sent him back to the minor leagues [in 2000]. He had no command of his fastball, and he didn't even want to use his fastball. I've never seen his command that off or his pitch selection that bad.\" In 2010, Halladay averaged 40 fastballs a game. In his start Tuesday, he threw just 14 all night. People keep speculating that \"something's up.\" But Halladay remains adamant that he's healthy., 186940=mick, there have been people saying here that Detwiler's September performance was a mirage so not sure you discovered anything people have questioned for a while. If you don't believe it read through comments.He did short outings on extra rest which really didn't give the full picture of what you would get pitching Detwiler every 5 days. This season he started strong but just couldn't put batters away and threw too many pitches in too few of innings.My feeling is the same. The kid lacks stamina., 160430=Oh, nevermind. I owe NF05 a Coke. :-)NatsFan05 said\u2026 @ Grandstander \u2013 May 26, 2012 6:43 PM I think it was mainly Tracey\u2019s job and he pulled his hammy. He was probably getting treatment.

Ozzie guessed right. Giants still leading 3-2.uninvited neighbor ESPNhttp://blogs.ajc.com/atlanta-braves-blog/2012/05/27/its-beachy-vs-gonzalez-in-espn-sunday-night-game/, 41917=Eugene, interesting post concerning Baseball Prospectus. At the beginning of the season, I predicted 84-85 wins for the Nats with them contending until the end. With Strasburg being shut down in August and Wang coming back from a abbreviated season last year, the prediction looks accurate. It is going to be an exciting year this year and definitely WS contention next year with the team at full strength and another year of experience under the young players belt., 199925=any one, where would Rendon fit into the picture in 2013, 1837=Can't ask for a situation much more advantageous than that. It begins at 4:05 p.m. today when Strasburg gets the nod against struggling left-hander Mike Minor (0-3, 10.46 ERA over his last five starts). As you know, I'm not in Atlanta this weekend, so please enjoy the conversation among yourself again\u2026, 95820=Pseudo related question:If Nats are in contention come August and Strasburg is approaching his innings limit, would the team consider making him the closer for the rest of the way? I can imagine numerous reasons they wouldn't do that, but I find the idea intriguing considering the vacancy in the closer's role and having your ace in high leverage situations.What do you think?, 154823=@ Grandstander \u2013 May 26, 2012 6:43 PM I think it was mainly Tracey\u2019s job and he pulled his hammy. He was probably getting treatment., 126340=Strasburg will be fine. Remember, this was only his 27th career start. Not even the equivalent of a full season.He had trouble locating his fastball today, but still struck out 6. Velocity was 95-99mph.ERA now sits at a very good 2.64 for the season.For comparison, through his first 10 starts in 2010 he was: 5-3 with an ERA of 3.07.Basically, I'm not even slightly concerned about him. He an elite pitcher who happened to give up 4 runs today., 159436=My guess was that Tracy, who usually does the honors, wasn't there because of the injury.Grandstander said\u2026 My wife is very disappointed that no one in the Nats dugout took Harper's helmet off after his HR at the beginning of the 7th inning. Any thoughts as to why? I was wondering about that too. My theory is that it's the rookie treatment. May 26, 2012 6:43 PM, 51880=Read that Mike Minor has given up more home runs than any other Braves starter since 2007. Looks like it's true. :)That is some battery we got here., 34424=MicheleS @ 1:47 p.m. \u2014 Sorry, I'm missing some subtle humor or perhaps a pointed reference there. I get your point about the lack of experience and/or range in the OF, but what do you mean by \"\u2026our 3 infielders \u2013 notice I didn't say 4\"?, 28729=Here are some remarks from fangraphs on Stras and today's game:Regarding Who Pitches for WashingtonRight-hander Stephen Strasburg (53.0 IP, 70 xFIP-, 1.8 WAR) pitches for them.A Notable Comment Regarding StrasburgHere\u2019s a recent comment \u2014 notable because of who made it \u2014 regarding Strasburg: William Ladson@washingnats Chipper Jones on #Strasburg: \"He has the best stuff, the best repertoire of pitches that I've seen on any one single pitcher.\" #Nats #MLB25 May 12What We Can Say About the Aforementioned RepertoireAccording to PITCHf/x, here\u2019s Strasburg\u2019s repertoire this season, accompanied by the average velocity and usage of each pitch:\u2022 Four-Seam Fastball: 96.0 mph, 47.0%\u2022 Two-Seam Fastball: 94.8 mph, 16.4%\u2022 Curveball: 80.3 mph, 21.4%\u2022 Changeup: 88.5 mph, 15.1%What Else We Can Say About the Aforemented RepertoireWhile it\u2019s difficult to for us (read: the present author) to say objectively that Strasburg\u2019s repertoire is the best in the league (or that Chipper Jones has ever seen), one thing we do know is that, according to pitch-type linear weights, none of his (i.e. Strasburg\u2019s) pitches have ever profiled as below-average during his three years in the majors.Additionally, A Third Thing We Can SayA third thing we can say is, let\u2019s trust Chipper Jones, how about.A Note on the Camera Angle HereAtlanta\u2019s center-field camera angle is probably the best in the league. This is the first time Strasburg will have pitched in front of it this season \u2014 and only the second time he\u2019s done so in his career (June 28th, 2010).Readers\u2019 Preferred BroadcastPer the results of our offseason crowdsourcing project, FanGraphs like Atlanta and Washington Radio about the same., 2161=WASHINGTON NATIONALS at ATLANTA BRAVES Where: Turner Field Gametime: 4:05 p.m. EDT TV: MASN, MLB.tv Radio: WJFK (106.7 FM), WFED (1500 AM), XM 185 Weather: Partly cloudy, 91 degrees, Wind 8 mph in from LF, 166838=Soul Possession, My PFB Hitterish Sofa said\u2026 Question: Do you recall the Braves under Bobby Cox lollygagging, or getting hit in the head with fly balls because they forgot they have glasses? May 26, 2012 7:49 PM Only in the Play-Offs\u2026, 113213=Gotta love the guys who pimp out there with sunglasses on their heads instead of their faces. Managers have to love stuff like that. May not have been the sun, but still\u2026just the feeling of those falling off of your head is a major distraction., 201693=Also, the Braves may be showing they're far more dependent on Chipper than we are on the Beast. They're something like 7-17 without him in the lineup, which makes our playing 6 of our 18 games against them in the time he's on the 15-day DL pretty fortuitous. It also suggests that at least at this point in the season, they're a less resilient team than we are proving to be. That resilience in our squad so far is \u2014 along with our phenomenal pitching \u2014 the most remarkable part of the Nats' 2012 story. For everyone who still says \"2013 is the year\", that resilience indicates to me at least that this team already has the character to go all the way. Combination of Werth and Tracy in the dugout and Harp, Gio, JZimm, ALR, Desi (don't forget his leadership) on the field is the stuff that championships are made of., 188976=NF05, eh, let's split the difference and I'll take the peanuts. :-)swami, indeed on the continuing challenges in NL East, as MIA is currently 2.5 back, as are the Mets.JaneB, this season the Nats have a dugout tradition of removing the helmet of a returning teammate who has homered (or, in some cases, had a key hit). It is removed as he makes his way through the dugout getting high fives. It was recently revealed that the thinking is that he won't have to travel the length of the dugout after the high five sequence, to return his helmet to the rack (awk-ward). Tracy has done the honors most often, though Desmond has been known to do so on occasion. I believe that both have been credited with\u2026dang, I just read sec3's explanation. Nevermind. (Adds Coke to shopping list.)dj, nice pull on the quote. Never did like clown acts.On sweeps, would love to win this one. otoh, I'm not gonna complain about not finishing off sweeps when we're not all that far from the day when we worried about avoiding them. But that's just me. :-)NatsFan05 said\u2026 @ natsfan1a said\u2026 May 26, 2012 7:31 PM Oh, nevermind. I owe NF05 a Coke. How about a beer and bag of peanuts\u2026.LOL May 26, 2012 7:57 PM, 169261=@ natsfan1a said\u2026 May 26, 2012 7:31 PM Oh, nevermind. I owe NF05 a Coke. :-)How about a beer and bag of peanuts\u2026.LOL, 192225=I count the raind shortened series against the marlins in April as a sweep though most seem to ignore that.We're not ignoring it\u2013they haven't finished the series yet. They still have to play game 3. If they win that, it's a sweep, but just like today's game, they haven't played it yet., 214837=This is a fascinating article. Lots of stuff to chew on, including Davey\u2013not so much the drugs, pain, lying, etc., which you could have guessed.Is it really that easy to diagnose and \"fix\" problems with a pitcher's delivery? If so, why doesn't it happen more often?I headed off the mound and signaled to my pitching coach, Mike Roarke, to follow me to the locker room. I told him straight out what happened, and followed with this: \u201cI\u2019m not coming out of the game.\u201d He said he had to pull me. I was supposed to go to the big club any day, and they needed to know. Not to mention he did not want to see me ruin my arm.What he did not know is that my arm had been bad for years.He was a mountain of a man, an old catcher with busted hands; he knew how to play with pain. I told him that this was my shot and that if he didn\u2019t help me, I would deny this conversation ever happened. Right then and there, he reworked my delivery to take pressure off my shoulder, and I headed back out to the game.the-former-met-bob-ojeda-relives-both-glory-and-painhttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/27/sports/baseball/the-former-met-bob-ojeda-relives-both-glory-and-pain.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all}",
