You have a variety of foods from all kinds of cultures. It almost make you feel like home. The area is clean, the staff is nice and the location is perfect.

I always liked Morgan because it is convenience in location and the tuition is reasonable. My mother also graduation in 2000 with a Master Degree in Engineering. Live in the Academic Moment A college education is a classic process-versus-product paradigm. Plenty of students complain about their work or obsess about their G.P.A., but that is just wasted energy and time. \u00c3?\u00c2?\u00c3?\u00c2? Get caught up in any academic ennui. Instead, focus on your assignments, papers and projects for their intrinsic learning value; the grades will come naturally. Don't Study in Your Room Unless you have a spartan single and concentration powers of steel, your room is the worst place to study because of the comfort and the distractions. Given the realities of dorm life, it's far too easy to wander across the hall and talk to your neighbor, or to have Facebook on while you glance back and forth from your book to the screen. Get Connected to Campus Life Academic clubs, social organizations and professional associations take on a larger, more applied and energetic meaning in college. You should jump in with both feet, even if it means getting outside your comfort zone a little bit., 669350=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 589169=If you are looking for a place where you can get a good education, meet nice teachers and other students without having to travel miles away from home and pay high tuition cost, then Morgan is your key to success. Students looking for ways to earn a degree without paying high cost and having the opportunities to apply for loans and scholarships, don't look no more. .Recognize the environment This is often difficult to do depending on your background. If you grew up in a city or attended a large high school, this will likely be easier than it will be for students with different experiences. Finding oneself in a community where the majority of the residents and daily contacts are young people living autonomously is often a strange sensation, especially if you are a freshman coming out of high school. Adjust to the changes in the academic requirements This is a step towards enjoying college that is often difficult for many people, while others may find the transition smooth and fitting. College coursework initially appears harder than other sorts of educational challenges you may have faced. Create your solid friend group Handling any situation in the melancholy torment of solitude is not an environmental condition that will be conducive to your success. After all, forcing one to be alone is a tool that is utilized as a harsh punishment. Morgan has a tradition of producing some of the best and brightest graduates in a wide range of professional disciplines. Philanthropic support, whether it is through your time or financial resources, is part of what makes Morgan great and one of the reasons we consider our alumni and friends as one of this University's greatest assets.

We offer a strong football program, 2011 and 2012 MEAC Conference Champion basketball squad, reigning MEAC Championship cheerleading squad, the world-reknown Morgan State University Choir, highly acclaimed Morgan State University Band Program highlighted by the fantastic marching band, The Magnificent Marching Machine, the Student Government Association, anime clubs, foreign language clubs and all sorts of clubs that allow students to channel their passions for non-scholastic persuits., 573184=The Greek Life has always been one of the most popular organizations on most campus. Joining a sorority or fraternity is something that most students sign up for. It's a way to bring people together, making them more powerful, teach them how to overcome weakness and how to make the most out of their life. Fraternities, sororities, and social clubs were established at Morgan State University as early as 1913 and since then have played an active and vital role in the lives of many of our students.
