            "SIDE SKIRT SYSTEM FOR A TRAILER - A side skirt system for reducing drag on a trailer includes a side skirt wall configured to be coupled to one side of the trailer to extend below a side wall of the trailer along a length of the trailer. A mounting bracket assembly of the system is coupled to the side skirt wall and is configured to be coupled to a floor assembly of the trailer. The mounting bracket assembly is configured to tilt laterally outwardly and laterally inwardly with respect to a generally vertical axis parallel to the side wall of the trailer.",
            "SIDE UNDERRIDE CABLE SYSTEM FOR A TRAILER - A side underride cable system configured to be coupled to a trailer includes a front mounting bracket assembly configured to be coupled to the trailer, a rear mounting bracket assembly configured to be coupled to the trailer at a location spaced-apart from the front mounting racket assembly, and a plurality of cables configured to extend at least partially along a length of each side of the trailer between the front mounting bracket assembly and the rear mounting bracket assembly.",
