            "The Vanderbilt campus is very safe, but students have to keep in mind that we are in the center of a city. So students need to be aware and careful of wandering off campus at night. As long as students take the necessary precautions and travel in groups, they should be more than safe.",
            "Greek life is a big part of campus, but it does not dominate it. Most Greek members are proud of their affiliation and love their sisters or brothers, but the Greek organizations commingle to a great extent. Being in a certain Greek organization in no way limits your social circle.",
            "There are clubs for every kind of interest - most students have an issue with joining too many clubs rather than the other way around.",
            "Vanderbilt is great for students who are slightly preppy, driven, and fun. Students who thrive here are great in the classroom and out - they are very involved with organizations, do their homework, study when they need to, and love going out with friends.",
            "Vanderbilt is one of the most expensive schools in the country, and some students complain about it. But in the end, Vanderbilt is worth every penny. The professors are top notch, opportunities are plentiful, dorm life and food are great, and the experience overall is unmatched. If you can come here, you should.",
            "Vanderbilt is in the center of Nashville, the famous music city. There is so much to do here that most students cannot finish it all before they graduate. There are concerts every day and night, parties on campus, Greek date parties and formals, bars for those over 21, a couple local malls and movie theaters, and tons of other fun campus events. You will never be bored here at Vanderbilt!",
            "The food at Vanderbilt is very good. There are tons of options, from brick oven pizza restaurant, to a vegetarian caf\u00c3??\u00c3?\u00c2\u00a9. Any type of eater can find plenty of things they will like here, not to mention the plentiful options off campus in the great city of Nashville!",
            "The freshman dorms are top notch - the buildings are beautiful, with warm common rooms and large bedrooms. There is plenty of room for a student's things, and enough room to hang out with friends or do homework. They are on a certain portion of campus called The Commons - it is separated from main campus to foster class unity, and it does just that. Freshmen make great friends with their classmates, especially with their hall mates. The upperclassmen dorms are not as new, but as always, new dorms are being constructed. They are suite style dorms that are being built in the place of old buildings that contained single rooms.",
            "Vanderbilt is a very challenging school. Engineering majors and the pre-medical track are particularly rigorous, but many students thrive. However, there is little to no cutthroat competition between students; students very much work together, and want their peers to succeed in addition to themselves.",
            "Vanderbilt is difficult to get into, but admissions loves students who have a passion. They like to see that prospective students are involved in things that they are truly interested in, and that they know what they want in life. That said, there are many students here who have undecided majors, or who have no idea what their future holds. Just be yourself! Let your personality and drive come through in your application, and especially in your essay. Do not try to be something that you are not, because the admissions counselors can tell - just be yourself, and they will like you more for it.",
            "Vanderbilt is a vibrant university, with exciting social opportunities and a stimulating academic environment. Students can get anything they want here, from Division I sports games to intensive laboratory work. Every student is unique, with admirable ambition and drive; together, they all make Vanderbilt a fantastic place to be."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{250292=Not a student here but Vanderbilt is currently ranked #16 in US News' 2015 edition Best National Universities so...., 245759=All the freshman live on a part of campus called the Commons in 10 different houses. About half of the houses are older but renovated and the other half were newly built in 2007. By living with other freshmen exclusively, it creates a sense of community where everyone is pretty much going through the same struggles. The houses compete all year to win the Common's Cup- a tradition that builds further community within respective houses. PSA: North house rocks, 243272=The Vanderbilt campus is a natural arboretum, which means there are a variety of animals on campus. For one, the squirrel population outnumbers that of student by a 3:1 ratio. On a rainy evening, try walking around the Commons dining hall and don't be surprised when a cute, fluffy bunny dashes across your path. For finals, Vanderbilt offers a variety of activities to help students de-stress. One of these is a De-Stress Fest where massages, manicures, pedicures and food are provided for students to take the edge of finals week., 25637=Small class sizes. Student to faculty ratio 9:1. Also the prestige of the school is well known., 2345=Vanderbilt is currently ranked #18 in the nation, tied with Notre Dame and Emory. Many of you prospective students may be wondering, Why should I pay $37,000 per year for my college tuition? In order to attend an equivalently ranked school, you would only be paying about $700 less for Emory and about $300 less for Notre Dame. But, please give me a chance to convince you that the experience and education that Vanderbilt has to offer is worth your $300 - $700 extra dollars. 1) Vanderbilt provides a great balance between work and play. Many students live by the motto: work hard, play harder...so if partying is your thing then you will find plenty of opportunities to reward yourself for all of your A's and your well-earned B's. But, the great thing about Vandy is that if you prefer not to hang around the party scene scattered with frat juice, black lights, the Ying Yang Twins, and party fouls, then you too are not alone. There are plenty of work-a-holics that can find pure joy and soothing happiness simply by correctly solving a differential equation, but don't want the buzz of a cool beer to help relax their nerves. 2) Vandy is a great place to make friends from all over the U.S. and the world. I had the opportunity to go to one of my state universities, but after visiting my friends there I realized how happy I was that I had decided to go to Vanderbilt instead. All of my friend's friends were the same people from our high school or other people from our state. They had learned nothing about other parts of our glorious country or world through their friendships. At Vanderbilt, I have friends from California, New York, Montana, Maryland, Wisconsin, Texas, Japan, Florida, India, North Carolina, Great Britain, Ohio, Missouri, Georgia, Virginia, West Virginia, Alabama, Mississippi, Massachusetts, Tennessee...do you get the point? I have friends living all over our planet...I mean, how awesome is that! Many students at Vanderbilt are open to having friendships with people of a different race, ethnicity, religion, etc. If I were to go to any major city in the U.S. right now, then I feel like I would have at least one person nearby that I would feel comfortable calling up if I needed help or needed a place to stay. My friends at Vandy are real friends. We care about each other's success and well-being. 3) Are you into music? I mean most people like some kind of music, right? Well, if you do like music then you are in luck because Vanderbilt is located in Nashville, TN...aka Music City, USA (or the Country Music Capital of the World). Okay, after reading that last part you probably had one of two reactions: ughhhhhhh I HATE country music! Game over...I will never go to Vandy. OR... You know I like my chicken fried, cold beer on a Friday night, a pair of jeans that fits just right, and the radio up. COUNTRY MUSIC HATERS KEEP READING 'cause I have good news for you: if you really despise country music then I promise you will do just fine in Nashville! There are tons of bars, concert halls, little dives, cafes, frats, and clubs where country music is not preformed. Many very talented starving artists have taken up root in Nashvegas and they too would absolutely love your support! So let all those Country-music lovers go support the rising country stars and songwriters in the Honkey-tonk part of Downtown and the rundown bluegrass bars. Just so you understand the wide variety of artists that play in Nashville here is a VERY small sampling of who I saw play last year, The Avett Brothers, Lil Wayne, Grassroots, The Wooten Brothers, the Flaming Lips, songwriters (for Garth Brooks, Brad Paisley, Keith Urban, etc.), Santigold, N.E.R.D., Pat Green, the Ying Yang Twins (at a frat party...good times), the Blair school of music, K'naan, T.I. (his last performance before he went to prison), Sarah Watkins (from Nickel Creek), etc. Yeah, so if you like music, then you will LOVE Nashville. 4) Another cool thing about living in Nashville is the celebrity sightings. It's no L.A., but it's still fun, especially if you don't come from a celebrity-filled home town. Taylor Swift randomly shows up at the Bluebird Cafe to play along with other artists or can be seen grabbing some pancakes in Hillsboro's Pancake Pantry. Nichole Kidman also enjoys these infamous pancakes, and shows up with hubby, Keith Urban, at the Green Hills Mall movie theater. And one night while dining at the restaurant called Watermark, I sat a few tables away from the handsome James Marsden...he also ran the Country Music Half Marathon in April. 5) Vanderbilt is going green...yeah, I know, so in right now. Vanderbilt's campus is a national arboretum and over near the fabulous freshman dorms is the Commons Center. This grand building is Vandy's trofeewife. Vanderbilt could not be more proud of her flush down, flush up toilets, automatic everything, and green this, green that. Vandy still has a long way to go on the green side of things, but if being environmentally conscious/friendly is one of your passions then you will be able to really help change the Vandy world with your ideas of how to greenify our already fabulous school and beautiful campus. But, if you could care less about all this green talk, then hey at least you get to benefit from from the people that do care...so going to Vanderbilt is a win-win. 6) Vandy is part of the SEC...which is incredibly fun. We get to go up against big state schools like Alabama, UGA, Ole Miss, etc. Yeah, so us Commodores might not be exactly well known for our athletic programs, but we do surprise people every now and then. I mean, who would have though that Vandy would beat Auburn 14-13 last fall! So it's always fun to show up to the sporting events, not only because those huge SEC athletes that are making touchdowns, dribbling down the court, or hitting a home run are your friends, but because they will probably give you a good reason to cheer as a proud Commodore when you are least expecting it. I believe and I promise that Vanderbilt University is a bang for the buck. If you're still reading at this point then I hope I have convinced you to come join me and my fellow students at Vandyland this fall. I would not trade my past year at Vandy for any other experience in the world...and yes, I know that statement sounds vague and slightly not believable, but it's the truth. I LOVE Vanderbilt. GO 'DORES!, 134317=I have a meeting here on July 11th and I plan on eating lunch in the Commons Hall I'm not sure if they have and Honors Hall at Vandy but if so I'd love to be enrolled here.But I'm still kind of worried about my ACT score it was a 25 but that was my first time so I'll probably take again twice before I apply here. However, does anyone know if they superscore or not?, 268312=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here I am from a small rural town in MO and that is not my style of living. I prefer to live in suburbs or a city and Nashville offers a great mix of both. Exploring the city while you have free time is always great because there is always something new to discover. The music scene is great as well and should be - considering Nashville is known as Music City, USA. Vanderbilt University is a very nice looking college. There is so many plants and trees around you that you honestly feel like you are walking through a park on your way to class and that provides for a great atmosphere. The buildings are mixed with old style architecture and modern buildings, also pleasing to the eye. The greek scene is pretty huge. Many of activities and community service to do. Am learning a lot Vanderbilt University is ranked 18th in the country for top universities. This means Vanderbilt takes pride in their ability to teach their students. There are a lot of classes to choose from and the professors are almost always willing to help outside of class if needed. I have only completed my freshmen year so far but I can say that I have never had a teacher decline to help me with something I didn't",
