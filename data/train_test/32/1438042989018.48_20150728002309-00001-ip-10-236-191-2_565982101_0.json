Cast: Skylar Astin, Daniel Booko, Francois Chau, Justin Chon, Miles Teller, Jonathan Keltz, Sarah Wright, Dustin Ybarra Teller Director: Jon Lucas and Scott Moore Genre: Comedy Runtime: 93 minutes Straight-A college student Jeff Chang has always done what\u2019s expected of him. But when his two best friends surprise him with a visit for his 21st birthday, he decides to do the unexpected for a change, even though his critical medical school interview is early the next morning. What was supposed to be one beer becomes one night of chaos, over indulgence and utter debauchery in this outrageous comedy. Rated: R for crude and sexual content, pervasive language, some graphic nudity, drugs and drinking. Links: VISIT OFFICIAL SITE VIEW TRAILER Find Out About",
