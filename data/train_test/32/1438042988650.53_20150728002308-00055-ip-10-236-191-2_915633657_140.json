            "Our campus is completely safe. Crime on campus is incredibly rare.",
            "There seems to be a never-ending supply of fraternities and sororities. If that's what you're looking for, you'll have plenty of options.",
            "There's a club for just about everything you can imagine. There's also tons and tons of different intramural sports to participate in.",
            "Texas A&M is great for all types of students. Our university is so big and diverse, there's a place for everyone to feel comfortable.",
            "There are too many traditions to name. There's a saying around campus, If it happens twice, it's a tradition. It would take more than ten pages to explain them all.",
            "If you're a Texas resident, you won't find a better college at this price. A&M is ranked in the top 25 universities nation-wide. Our college of engineering is one of the best in the world, literally. You're not going to get a better education anywhere else and it's definitely afffordable.",
            "College Station is home to the famous Northgate. It's located on the North side of campus, hence the name Northgate. At Northgate there's two pizza shops, a Freebirds, three dance halls, and six bars. On any given Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night, Northgate is where at least half of the 50,000 students will be. Even if you're not 21, it's still a blast. If you're only in College Station for one night, Northgate is where you need to be. Other than that, there's all the standard places to have fun: movie theaters, a bowling alley, putt-putt, etc.",
            "The food at the University dining hall is pretty average, nothing special. But there's plenty of chains on campus and within walking so if the food on campus isn't doing it for you, you've got plenty of options.",
            "The dorms aren't that nice, but then again what dorms are? The problem is, they're pretty expensive. There are plenty places to live off-campus that are much nicer and much cheaper. There's also a free shuttle service that covers the entire city, so you don't have to worry about driving to class.",
            "The courses here at A&M have the perfect amount of difficulty, especially the Honors classes. They're hard enough to challenge you and make you learn, but they're not so difficult that it's impossible to succeed. The professors are fantastic. Every once in a while you'll get a professor who's not that great of a teacher, but as a whole our faculty does a great job of teaching.",
            "When you come here, never be afraid to strike up a conversation or ask somebody for help! Literally everyone here will be more than happy to talk to you and help you out. Also, be prepared to walk! Our campus is HUGE.",
            "Texas A&M University - College Station is an amazing place to study. You'd be hard-pressed to find a friendlier university. Being a student here is like joining one huge family."

If you apply for scholarships during the rolling application process and receive at least a $1000.00 award, the scholarship and financial aid office will possibly extend a waiver on out of state tuition., 81269=The connections you make and the Aggie network you gain is definitely worth the cost of attending; qualified Aggies are more likely to get hired by Aggie bosses than alumni from other colleges. A&M offers financial aid to almost every student and has fairly low tuition if you live in-state. A&M was also named #9 on The Princeton Review's top 100 best value public colleges in January 2010 based on financial aid, costs and other criteria (USA Today)., 552811=Wonderful atmosphere on campus. Just attended NSC in early June and enjoyed hearing about all the great programs and classes I will start in the fall of 2012. Enjoyed getting to know some of my fellow classmates. I am from out of state and they were extremely nice and offered assistance for a new found Texas lifestyle!, 548560=Attended the meeting for Greek Life during NSC. Nice presentation. Not all national sororities and fraternities are at TAMU. Rush begins in late August for women. Around 3700 students participate in Greek Life., 209862=Out-of-state tuition is a little high compared to those who live in Texas. It would not be awful if you have scholarships because if you receive a $1,000 scholarship from Texas A&M they will grant you in-state tuition. That being said, the University only gives roughly 600 scholarships (said in the 2011/2012 e-mail), so your chances are not extremely high., 542553=One tradition includes our mascot Reveille. If she ever attends your class and she barks then the professor must release the class, no questions asked. I'm happy to say that it happened in my class during the Spring 2012 semester., 486347=When I stepped foot on the campus its just felt so right, like home. Every person I met there is very friendly. I would love to attend here in the fall 2012., 594659=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 551138=Freshman who live on campus are now required to have a dining plan beginning in the fall of 2012. TAMU has two large dining halls as well as other options throughout campus., 79520=If you're willing to work hard and go to a really large school, Texas A&M is for you. There is no specific type of student, because essentially everyone can find a place in College Station where they fit in. But if you love traditions, forget about every other school and go to A&M. It's firmly rooted in tradition, honor, and excellence, and has been since 1876. Also, if you're thinking about going into the military, join the Corps of Cadets of Aggieland and get an edge for a future career in the armed forces., 516443=As I said earlier Texas A&M is strongly rooted on traditions. Some of the major traditions are the bonfire memorial, muster, silver taps and Big Event. During the Bonfire Memorial students meet at 2 am on a cold November day to honor the students who died during the tragedy years ago. Muster and Silver taps is a cermony held on the first tuesday to honor past and present students who have recently passed away. Lastly, Big Event is the largest member activity in the nation. Last year we had about 40,000 students volunteer. During this event, students give back to the community by helping homeowners with household chores to say thanks for letting us be apart of their community., 385192=I love the school when i first visited the school. I feel excited and looking forward to this fall of 2012. I will a freshman in college, and longing to attend my first football game :], 8155=Apply early. I applied early December and got my acceptance letter in January. This gave me time to think about the decision I was about to make. Join the Corps. The scholarship, guaranteed on-campus housing, academic support only available to corps members, and leadership training, not to mention the friends you will make, are so very important. Also, Aggie traditions are all based in the Corps, and those not in the Corps don't understand some of the most important aspects of being an Aggie. Visit the college. I can tell you everything great about it, but you need to visit and make sure it fits you., 159467=The atmosphere at College Station is the best in the nation and we are know for being the friendliest college in the nation. We say HOWDY to everyone and are home of the 12th man. You will never be board at a football game or any other sporting even and there is more than a 1000 campus organizations to get involved with. This was the only college I applied to after one visit., 249858=Apply early. The earlier you apply, the better your chances of being accepted. Applications start on August 1 and continue into December. Don't worry about bad ACT or SAT scores. Just apply. You may never know.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students There is no one that A&M, and the Corps, is not perfect for. The reason I went there ultimately is that it was a huge school, and since I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted to major in, I knew I would find something if I stuck around long enough (and I have). Tips for prospective students Apply early. I applied early December and got my acceptance letter in January. This gave me time to think about the decision I was about to make. Join the Corps.

I can tell you everything great about it, but you need to visit and make sure it fits you. Bang for the buck Being from out of state, it was worrisome picking a Texas school due to finances. But by joining the Corps of Cadets, I received a moderate scholarship, which ALSO gave me instate tuition. The facilities I have access to as a student",
