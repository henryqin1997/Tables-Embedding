The two Kamaz trucks have been followed in by the two Ivecos belonging to Gerard De Rooy (2\u201949' behind the winner) and former world rally champion, Miki Biasion (3\u201910' behind the winner). In fifth place, 3\u201956' of the lead, Pieter Versluis\u2019s Man truck finished the special with a lead of 6 seconds over the Tatra driven by Ales Loprais. Eduard Nikolaev finished seventh, 6\u201927' behind the stage winner., 3569=Russian Kamaz driver Andrey Karginov has resumed racing, as has Polish quad rider Lukasz Laskawiec. Eric Vigouroux, however, is still at a standstill in this zone., 3983=Andrey Karginov and Ayrat Mardeev are leading the dance in the truck special. 2\u201919' separate the two Kamaz trucks after 276 km. Behind them, Dutchman Gerard De Rooy is in third, 3\u201907' off the lead, followed by the Tatra of Ales Loprais, 3\u201912' off the lead, and the Man driven by Pieter Versluis, 4\u201916' behind the stage leader., 12189=With race number 40 on his bib, Riaan Van Niekerk is 13th, among the names that have resonated at the forefront of the Dakar over the last few days. He has been discrete, and the secret of his position is his consistency. He is one of the leading names on the South African endurance circuit, but his first Dakar could prove to be exceptional. The experience of Australian Rodney Faggotter is not much more extensive, but he also features in a very respectable 15th place, ahead of Jeremias Israel Esquerre and Ben Grabham, two men who have shone, to varying degrees, on the Dakar 2013., 2315=The Italian has achieved the best time at the half-way point, placing his Iveco ahead of Ales Loprais (Tatra) by 25' and Andrey Karginov (Kamaz) by 26'. Pieter Versluis (Man) occupies fourth place, 1\u201933' behind the Biasion, and is followed by Martin Kolomy and Gerard De Rooy, respectively 2\u201936' and 3\u201946' behind the current stage leader., 5123=The Russian trucks were already at the top of the pile, but tonight they boast a 1-2-3 in the general standings. Eduard Nikolaev still leads the Dakar 2013, 31\u201920' ahead of Ayrat Mardeev and 50\u201926' in front of Andrey Karginov. Behind them, the gaps have closed, because there is only 2\u201936' between third place and the Tatra driven by Martin Kolomy, himself under threat from G\u00e9rard De Rooy\u2019s Iveco, only 3\u201920' behind., 573=The trucks have been led on to the link stage by Iveco team driver, Gerard De Rooy, the unfortunate favourite of the Dakar 2013. After the neutralisation of yesterday\u2019s stage at CP1, he was awarded the victory ahead of Ales Loprais (Tatra) and Eduard Nikolaev, who, at the wheel of a Kamaz 4326, is the general standings leader in the category, with a lead of 35\u201911' over his team-mate Ayrat Mardeev., 3322=A little before the 239-km point, the Kamaz driven by Andrey Karginov has ground to a halt on a track that crosses the day\u2019s stage route, a little bit ahead of the position where Eric Vigouroux also stopped several minutes ago. In the same area, the quad ridden by Lukasz Laskawiec is also still immobile., 13469=There are riders, in the majority, who are taking part in the colours of KTM, Honda or Yamaha And then there are the others, whose steeds, less common in the bivouac, attract attention. In 37th, Portugal\u2019s Mario Patrao is one of them. With his Suzuki RMZ 450 Rally, he looks like he will finish the Dakar on his very first participation: the finish is not far now This is also what Swedish rider Thomas Berglund must be saying, on his very rare Husaberg. However, he will be frustrated at the finish, since he rubbed shoulders with the top 20 in 2007 and 2010, 1876=The two crews occupying the leading places are only separated by 3 seconds after 91 km. Miki Biasion has slipped into third place 9 seconds behind the stage leader. They are followed by Ales Loprais (17' off the lead) and Marcel Van Vliet in joint fifth with Andrey Karginov (43' behind the stage leader).}",
