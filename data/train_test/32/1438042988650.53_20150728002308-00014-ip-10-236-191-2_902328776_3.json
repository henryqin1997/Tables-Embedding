            "Curfews are at 12am on weekdays and 2am on weekends. Rules are you have to be in the dorm by that time. Everyone watches out for each other too. I felt really safe.",
            "Lot of activities to do on campus. They also have many ministries to take part in",
            "At $26,100 a year for the 2012-2013 school year. It's a little pricey. But getting their scholarships will help. $14,00 a year for the Presidential merit, $10,000 a year for the Presidential, and $6,000 a year for the Dean. But I brought mine down considerably. Apply to outside scholarships as well",
            "Not much to do in Dayton. But when you get the chance go to Pocket Wilderness. Waterfalls, hiking, and beautiful scenery. There are shops on Main St. But not much.",
            "Good food, lot of options to choose from",
            "There is a great sense of community around the dorms. It's like an extended family.",
            "If you plan on being a science major, be prepared for a rigorous program. Bryan has a really tough program, but it will prepare you for Medical school or where ever you want to go with it. Science isn;t their only strong point!! Bryan has some awesome majors. The professors will prepare you for where ever you are headed!",
            "Plan a trip to visit the campus. The Elevate program is a good way to see what is in store for you there. Apply so that an admissions counselor can contact you and answer any question you have.",
            "So far so good! Sat in on some classes earlier last year and really learned alot!! I am excited about going in the fall!!"

    "textAfterTable": "For a small Christian school, it's not overly expensive, but it's more than a state school. Good education, though. They were not overly helpful when it came to finding money for me to go here, maybe because I'm from out of state. Am enjoying being here I enjoy it most of the time. Some of the people are a little too legalistic, which drives me crazy. Look past them and you'll find good people. Am learning a lot I think some of the professors don't like athletes and that makes it hard, because I am one. Some of the profs are easy to talk to, but others are downright impossible.
