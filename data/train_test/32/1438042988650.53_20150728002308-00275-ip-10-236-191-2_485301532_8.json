When the judging level is to be set in three steps, for example, the communication area-setting means in the microcomputer 10A compares the vehicle speed data Vr with two predetermined values, and sets the communication area to any one of a normal communication area, a communication area smaller than the normal communication area, or a communication area larger than the normal communication area. In the above-mentioned embodiment, the judging level was set in two steps (LE1, LE2). The judging level, however, may be set in three or more steps. Embodiment 2 It needs not be pointed out that the communication area is variably set within a range that complies with the Wireless Telegraphy Act. Though the above embodiment 1 has dealt with the case of automatically collecting the toll by using the DSRC car-mounted equipment as the ETC car-mounted equipment, mounting the equipment 1A on the vehicle that travels on a toll",
