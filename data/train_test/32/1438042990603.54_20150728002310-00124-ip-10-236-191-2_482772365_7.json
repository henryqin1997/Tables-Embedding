However, it should be understood that the invention is not intended to be limited to the particular forms disclosed. Rather, the invention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives failing within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the following appended claims. As with the tip electrode 20 described above, the impedance of the annular electrode 24 shown in FIG. 1 may be enhanced. Referring now to FIG. 16, which is a magnified side view of the annular electrode 24 and a portion of the lead sleeve 12, a first portion of the annular electrode 24 may be selectively coated with a coating 72 like the coating 46, while a preselected second portion of the exterior of the electrode may be left exposed. In the illustrated embodiment, the second portion constitutes a series of peripherally spaced patches 74. However, as noted above, the configuration of the exposed area or areas may be varied. The patches 74 may be established as described above in conjunction with the electrode 20. The patches 74 provide conducting pathways to myocardial tissue with higher impedances than would otherwise be possible if the entirety of the exterior of the electrode 74 contacted myocardial tissue.
