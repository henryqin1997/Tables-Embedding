The invention, therefore, is not to be restricted except in the spirit of the appended claims. If at reference number 232, the user record corresponding to the subscriber, local cache 84 performs the acts at reference 248. At reference number 248, local cache 84 contacts a mother cache, such as mother cache 74 as shown in FIG. 2, and requests the user record. In accordance with a presently preferred embodiment and as described above, local cache 84 obtains the user record from mother cache 74 using UDP. UDP as a communication method is not intended to limit the present invention in any way. Other methods may be used such as the alternative embodiment of using the publisher/subscriber method described above. The acts at reference number 234 is then performed. At reference number 246, access event publisher publishes an accounting stop event. At reference number 244, if client 86 receives an account stop signal, step 246 is performed. Otherwise, client 86 keeps processing until an account stop signal is received. At reference number 242, access event publisher 82 publishes an accounting start event. At reference number 240, if client 86 receives the account start signal, step 242 is performed.",
