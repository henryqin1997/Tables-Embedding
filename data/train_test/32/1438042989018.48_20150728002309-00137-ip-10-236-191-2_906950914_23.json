            "Plenty of cop cars patrolling around campus. The world is not safe but nothing major happens on campus.",
            "They are around. They tend to cause some controversy for the schools reputation but if you want to do it, they are open to new interests.",
            "Something for everyone. A lot of social and cultural groups. Process to start your own is pretty straight forward if you are willing to work for it.",
            "Great school for the sciences. Entire school devoted to engineering. New technology centers built and more are being planned for the future.",
            "You are bound to find something to your liking. Surrounding town is boring at times so do not expect much.",
            "Public school so cheaper than the ivy league schools. Bookstore off campus that give discounts on books. If you do not have parents who will pay for everything, you will need to watch your wallet closely.",
            "Campus activities readily available. Plenty of student groups to join, and if you are willing, you can start your own. The surrounding area can give you something to do if you venture out. Greek life available.",
            "Food quality not worth the cost.",
            "Dorms are okay. New dorms were built but I have not been in them. People are friendly in the dorms. If you are open, you will meet people especially if you keep your door open during opening weekend.",
            "Tough classes if you do not take it seriously. Put in your study hours.",
            "Buy a good jacket because the winters are brutal at times. Find a good group of people to hang out with when times get boring. Take advantage of career development center and professors office hour. Save up on money.",
            "Even though people like to mock public schools, Binghamton is a great. Good professors and good academics that will help you for the future."

However, do NOT pack too much clothes! You simply do not need too many outfits. Also, do go overboard buying any school supplies before you get to the school, depending on your classes, all you might need is a pen, a pencil, a folder, and loose-leaf paper. Additionally, be wary of your meal plan allowance, because even though you are billed around $2000 for the year, you are only allotted $800 in the Fall and then the other $800 in the Spring. Don't go spending too much money on groceries available in the school with your meal plan, instead go to Walmart or Target! Finally, always go to class of course! The amount of freedom you have distorts your perception of reality, and soon enough, your coursework will catch up with you and you will have many sleepless nights catching up! Most importantly of all, make friends of course, and enjoy your stay at Binghamton!, 210965=The best place to live on campus now is in the Newing Community. It just opened in 2011 and it's definitely the most comfortable place to live on campus in terms of the buildings and rooms and the dining hall. Its also pretty close to the Union. The school is still adding new buildings to Newing. Mountainview is the next nicest place to live on campus, its fairly new but not the best in terms of location. Hinman is great for the super studious because it's close to the lecture hall and library. Dickingson and College-In-The-Woods are alright., 458343=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 451287=If you don't like winter or cloudy days, I suggest you go to another school. I love summer a lot and enjoy sunny warm days, and Binghamton weather is definitely the opposite of my preference. There is usually sun and shine the first month and half of school (end of August to mid October) and last months of school (end of April to mid May). Every other month is full of rain, cloud days, and snow. Definitely bring boots and a super warm jacket. It's always brick cold weather here after October., 430692=Disclosure: This reviewer is an adjunct faculty member (since 1997) as well as a student in one of the PhD programs. However, this reviewer attended BU in 1976 as a transfer student (dropped out in senior year) and again in 1984 completing both UG and MS by 1989. This is one of the top 100 schools in the country. It promotes research at the UG stage which provides practical experience desired by employers. Students can earn post-graduate degrees; some programs combine UG and Grad degrees reducing the time to earn both degrees., 58549=Prepare to study! I maintained a good average and got a 2280 on my SAT--never studied, never had a tutor all through highschool. Now, I study all the time! The professors expect you to keep up your end of the deal., 193901=I know a number of students who attend Binghamton, and I know that this school has a ton to offer a student in terms of academic, extracurricular, and career opportunities. The campus is well-kept and the student population is diverse. These are only a few of the reasons I chose to transfer to Binghamton for the Fall 2013 semester., 253667=Visited SUNY Binghamton in November and LOVED the campus. Also, the town of Binghamton itself seems very friendly and inviting. Definitely my first choice school., 156773=Here in Binghamton they're residential communities. Communities are Hinman, Dickinson, Newing, Mountain View, Susquehanna, and Hillside. The last two mentioned are apartment style residence, which is only available to upperclassman. Hinman, and Mountain View are suite style. Dickinson, and Newing are corridor style. Mind you, they are constructing a new Dickinson, so it will be brand new for incoming students during the 2013 year. Newing and Mountain View are new as well, and Hinman will be the oldest yet most social of the communities here in binghamton,.}",
