            "This school is great for people who like a small group environment, but still enjoy being around a lot of people. The students and faculty are very friendly and everybody is connected through clubs and residential halls. Most people leave their dorm room doors open for others to come in and hang out.",
            "If you decide to attend PLU, I suggest that you get involved in many different activities. This is a great way to meet new people and get involved in your new school. I also suggest applying to as many different scholarships as you can.",
            "The tuition is expensive but PLU offers many scholarships to those who need and deserve help.",
            "I enjoy PLU very much. The students and faculty are friendly and always willing to help with any problem you have. Clubs are welcoming to anyone who wants to join and they can help you figure out what your passions are.",
            "The professors are very dedicated to helping their students learn. Most are friendly and more than willing to help a struggling student who comes into their office during office hours, or even reaches out through e-mail."

I am also very active in the Crossfit Community and entered the crossfit open in 2013. HIking, biking, and any other physical activity are appealing to me., 92263=I only was given the opportunity to live in the dorms during the January term at PLU but it was probably the best time of my life. For the most part, the dorms are very relaxed and quiet hours are respected. They aren't that new but they are much bigger rooms than other universities I've visited., 206720=PLU is pretty quirky, so I probably won't remember all of the quirks. If you visit, throw a rock across the bricks in Red Square; some sections are hollow underneath, and the rock makes a xylophone sound as it skitters across the square. Also spin the big rusty metal statues! Look for the diorama of the giant slug in Rieke, the science building. If you visit in February, you may be able to attend an annual performance of the Vagina Monologues, and look for a performance any time of the year by one of our excellent a cappella singing groups., 291436=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Reviewer has been to campus. 13 out of 13 people found this review useful. 2 of 65 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Students interested in the liberal arts, who want a smaller environment where you can really get to know everyone....from the people in residence hall to your professors. Tips for prospective students Apply for scholarships....they add up. Also, private universities like PLU look very expensive on the surface, but they give many more grants and other financial aid opportunities than the public universities do.
