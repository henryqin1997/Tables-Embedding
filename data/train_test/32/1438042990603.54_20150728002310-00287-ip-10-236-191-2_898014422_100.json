Whatever type of student you are, you will be able to find others like you at U of O., 410761=I toured the campus this summer during July, and absolutely fell IN LOVE with this school. The school spirit, the excessive friendliness emanating from people on every corner, how much there was to do and get involved in and the academic rigor they portrayed. Also, the campus is absolutely beautiful, and there seems like something to do for everyone, and there's no one specific stereotype at the U of O., 53173=Get your FAFSA in on time and if you are coming from a different state make sure you get it in by March 1st. My state gave me a different date and my mom is now working double time to pay for my education on her own.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Oregon utilizes their tax money and puts a large effort into education. In-State tuition is affordable for the majority of families and encourages people to get a college degree. Am enjoying being here Eugene is a wonderful place to start your life. It is a very nice community and a great college town. The school itself is small enough to feel the individual attention yet large enough to surround you with positive enforcement. Am learning a lot The U of O is a great college where the classes and professors create an awesome environment for learning. Teachers help students find a suitable field of study and the different ways to go about it. All the lower level classes are interchangeable with different majors so you are not wasting time or money.
