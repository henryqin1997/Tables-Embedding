Satisfaction, a Rolling Stones tribute band, will appear at Ashley Pond at 7 p.m. All Gordon\u2019s Summer Concerts are free. Satisfaction dubs itself as \u201cThe International Rolling Stones Show.\u201d This is the 15th year the group has been together and its website boasts 2,500 live performances during that time. The group became the first Rolling Stones show to debut on the Las Vegas Strip in 2005 and was given positive reviews for its performance. In 2010, according to the group\u2019s website, it was approved by the Rolling Stones to perform long term engagements with the Walt Disney Corporation. Chris LeGrand performs as the Stones\u2019 legendary frontman, Mick Jagger. LeGrand started Satisfaction in 2001.

Next week is Los Alamos Monitor night. Big Sam\u2019s Funky Town is scheduled to perform., 48359=Copyright \u00a9 2015, 20825=1) We are told that we can\u2019t get out from our ownership of San Juan until 2022. 2) We are told it is smart to maintain our ownership to recover our $6 million bond outlay for the NOx abatement equipment to be installed. 3) We are told we will have to pay our share of the expected forthcoming lawsuits whether in or out of the picture. Here is some background on all of these issues. Flexibility exists if we choose to take it. Going blindly ahead, we could be committing to much larger costs and here\u2019s why: First, the removal of our ownership of San Juan was on the table. Here is how several California cities utilities did it. It is revealed in the document Entitled \u201cCity of Colton Electric Utility Department 2013 Integrated Resource Plan,\u201d which can be found at ci.colton.ca.us/DocumentCenterView/1830: Here is a quote on page 17: \u201cThe California owners of Unit 4 (Anaheim and Modesto Irrigation District, Santa Clara and Redding or MSR) are trading their ownership in Unit 4 for capacity in Unit 3 so that when Unit 3 is decommissioned in 2017, they will have no remaining capacity in the project.\u201d, 31551=A sex offender who lived in Los Alamos was recently arrested in Seattle and charged with soliciting sex with a minor. Los Alamos sheriff Marco Lucero said he\u2019d recently been in contact with Seattle officials about Nolan Cyre. Lucero, who keeps tabs on registered sex offenders in Los Alamos County, said Cyre was \u201cbriefly\u201d registered in the county last year. Lucero said he\u2019d had several communications with Cyre during his short stay in Los Alamos before he chose to move to Washington state. Cyre, according to a story in the Seattle Times, was arrested earlier this month while allegedly attempting to pay an underage girl $100 for sex. According to the story, Cyre was allegedly attempting to meet the girl at a Seattle fast-food restaurant when he was arrested. Cyre was originally convicted of a sex offense in North Carolina in 2010. Lucero said there are currently eight registered sex offenders in Los Alamos County., 35534=An investigation into a May 15 house fire by the Los Alamos Fire Department has proved inconclusive, said a spokesperson for the LAFD. LAFD Dep. Chief Justin Grider said the department\u2019s conclusion is official. \u201cThe rule and cause determination has been ruled undetermined by the fire department,\u201d said Grider. However, he said the homeowner\u2019s insurance company is still investigating. Part of the investigation he said includes investigators testing objects within the area of origin. According to private insurance investigator Matt Williams, the fire started in an area that included a kitchen countertop. The fire occurred in the Tsikimu neighborhood on North Mesa sometime in the morning. According to police reports, Cpl. James Keane was patrolling the area when he spotted smoke coming from the house. Keane found two residents who had breached a raised glass door and were trying to get to a 57-year-old resident of the home who was still inside the burning building. Keane then went inside the burning house and brought the man out safely. The man was successfully treated at the local hospital for his injuries. Also rescued from the house were three dogs.}",
