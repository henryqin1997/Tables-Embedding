Depending on the pitch length, they can be switched either from (i) a color-reflecting to a weakly scattering black state or (ii) from a transparent black to a highly scattering white state. Suitable liquid crystalline materials include mixtures of nematic (C1-6) alkyl substituted cyanobiphenyl and cyanoterphenyls doped with chiral agents. Chiral agents confer a finite pitch on nematic material. Suitable chiral agents are R1011 and CB15 marketed by Merck Industries. Other suitable liquid crystalline compositions for use in the present invention will be known to those skilled in the art. The pitch length of the liquid crystalline material can be varied by varying the amount of chiral agent in the mixture., 21821=Other suitable mesogenic groups will be known to those skilled in the art such as disclosed in Thermotropic Liquid Crystals, Vol. 22 of Critical Reports on Applied Chemistry, G. W. Gray, Editor, John Wiley and Sons (1987); Introduction to Liquid Crystals by Priestley et al. (1975) and M. Schadt, Ber. Bunsenges Phys. Chem., 97, 1213 (1993), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference., 25561=Generally, the liquid crystalline composition of the present invention will comprise about 90 to 98 weight % of the low-molecular-weight (Mn of less than 1000, preferably less than 500) liquid crystalline material, about 0.2 to 3 weight % of the nonmesogenic crosslinking monomer, and about 2 to 10 weight % of the mesogenic monomer., 30705=The components were mixed in above order to yield 1000 mg of reactive, cholesteric mixture. The mixture was filled in the display device by means of a vacuum filling technique in order to exclude oxygen inhibition of the polymerization reaction. The polymerization reaction was started by exposing the filled device to UV radiation. The dose was adjusted to 1.5 mW/cm2 at 365 nm. Exposure time was 5.5 hours., 34392=were mixed in order to yield 1000 mg of reactive, cholesteric mixture. The filling and irradiation procedure were carried out as described in Example 1. Device operation: The driving voltage (90% of total specular contrast) of the device was 11 V. The field-free relaxation time from the scattering, focal-conic texture to the planar texture was 15 msec (measured between 10% and 90% of total specular transmission)., 30565=4.75 mg R1011 (chiral dopant), and, 32035=were mixed in order to yield 1000 mg of reactive, cholesteric mixture. The filling and irradiation procedure were carried out as described in Example 1. Device operation: The driving voltage (90% of total specular contrast) of the device was 7.0 V. The field-free relaxation time from the scattering, focal-conic texture to the planar texture was 92 msec (measured between 10% and 90% of total specular transmission)., 29664=Cholesteric liquid crystal: As a liquid crystal, a combination of the eutectic nematic mixture E48 (Merck) with the chiral dopant R1011 (Merck) was used. E48 contains a mixture of cyanobi- and terphenyls with a broad nematic temperature range. The amount of R1011 was adjusted to 0.5 weight %. This yields a cholesteric liquid crystal with a pitch length of about 5 microns., 33328=were mixed in order to yield 1000 mg of reactive, cholesteric mixture. The filling and irradiation procedure were carried out as described in Example 1. Device operation: The driving voltage (90% of total specular contrast) of the device was 50 V. The field-free relaxation time from the scattering, focal-conic texture to the planar texture was 1 msec (measured between 10% and 90% of total specular transmission).}",
