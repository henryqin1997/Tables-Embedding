    "textBeforeTable": "Star San Marino - A blast from the past with a new age twist. The vintage Roc that started it all meets Innova's high tech Star plastic to form the Star San Marino Roc. Star Rancho - new in May 2012. The Star Rancho Roc was previously reserved for fundraising only, but not any longer. A long time favorite of Pros and Ams alike, the Rancho Roc has earned its place among Innova's premier line of plastic. KC Pro Roc - is more stiff. DX Bottom Stamped - pictured is an Xcaliber Bottom Stamped disc Speed 4, Glide 4, Turn 0, Fade 3 It is a great choice for an experienced player's utility disc, hyzer shots, anhyzer shots, turnover shots when worn, sidearm approaches, and players who like to carry several versions of the same disc in various states of wear. The Innova KC-Pro ROC is simply the best, most versatile mid range driver Innova makes. It provides accuracy at any range. This disc can take and hold the angle of release, even into a headwind. It can be used for driving, upshots, straight shots, hyzer shots or anhyzers. The Roc ages gradually and predictably, becoming an excellent slow turning disc as it wears. If you\u2019re not sure what golf disc to throw, choose the Roc, just like the 14 out of 15 Innova Pros that have at least one if not 4 or 5 Rocs in their bag. It is the preferred mid range disc golf disc for",
    "textAfterTable": "\"The Ontario mold is my Roc of choice. I prefer the O-Roc's glide and stability over the San Marino & Rancho. The DX runs have been great lately as well, producing a nice, stout feel at 4 (or so) grams off max.\" - Gregg Hosfeld The best mid range driver in disc golf, if you don\u2019t throw one you're missing out. I use this disc for longer range approaches & upshots to the basket. It has great control and accuracy which makes it a great choice for medium length drives off the tee. This has been the mid-range disc of choice for a majority of World Champions in the last 20 years.\" - Avery Jenkins Compared to the regular Roc, If you are looking for a disc with more Fade, try the Viper more Turn, try the Super Stingray more Glide, try the Mako Other Speed 4 discs include the Coyote, Shark, Stingray, Super Stingray, Wolf, Mako, Roc+, Lycan, Cobra, King Cobra The Innova Roc+features Innova's Plus Mold rim which allows for a smooth release when throwing the disc.
