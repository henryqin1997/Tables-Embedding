    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{1668=Terry James Gustafson comes out of the world of business and finance, and brings a practical and entrepreneurial perspective to Six Sigma. After an undergraduate degree in finance from Baldwin-Wallace, and an MBA degree from Kent State, he began his career in the field of accounting with KPMG Peat Marwick in 1969, and advanced to a Partner position in auditing. After leaving public accounting in 1990, Terry helped found, build, and operate a series of technology-based entrepreneurial ventures, including venture-backed companies as well as a public company. In 2002, Terry co-founded Savvi International, which provides solutions for business performance improvement using Six Sigma, Lean, and Business Process Management techniques. Terry serves as Savvi\u2019s chief finance and operations officer. Since founding Savvi, Terry has been immersed in Six Sigma techniques, helping to design and develop Savvi\u2019s training courses in Six Sigma and Lean. In addition, he has extensively taught Six Sigma courses, both in a classroom and as an online instructor., 2905=Bruce David Williams has been fascinated with complex systems since the launch of Sputnik on his third birthday. With undergraduate degrees from the University of Colorado in Physics and Astrophysics, he entered a career in aerospace systems, where he first encountered Six Sigma after Motorola won the inaugural Baldridge Award in 1988. Later, with graduate degrees in technical management and computer science from Johns Hopkins University and Colorado, and as a member of the Hubble Telescope development team, he was intrigued by how breakdowns in the smallest components could lead to colossal system failures. He entered the Six Sigma industry for good in the mid-1990s when he founded a software company to pursue product life-cycle traceability. Bruce has since been founder and CEO of two Six Sigma research and technology firms, and is now Chairman and CEO of Savvi International, a provider of solutions for business performance improvement using Six Sigma, Lean, and Business Process Management techniques. He resides in the highly-variable environment of the desert foothills of North Scottsdale, Arizona, with his wife, two children, and a normal distribution of dogs, cats, birds, and horses.}",
