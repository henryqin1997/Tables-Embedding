            "Campus safety is a high priority. They have a Newark Police Station on Campus and they are always broadcasting announcements to stay safe and they also patrol Campus as well. Dorms require your ID and guests will need to be registered for the duration of their stay in your dorm room.",
            "While I never joined any of fraternities, I can tell you that Greek life are one of the highly active organizations on campus.

If you feel you belong in a Greek Life Organization, you will not go wrong at NJIT.",

The Greeks have a positive impact on the campus sponsoring safety events, raising awareness for causes and raising funds for them as well. There is a significant Greek presence on campus and a new housing facility for the Greeks will be opened fall 2013., 225328=I am currently a cadet in the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) on campus and will be attending pilot training upon completion of my bachelor' in May 2014. I have received beneficial leadership and management training that no college alone can teach., 257340=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 245381=Living on campus is ideal for time purposes, but dorm life can vary depending on the building you're in. Freshman dorms tend to have more events going on in them, while the Honors dorm tends to have a more social atmosphere. The upper class dorms tend to be somewhere in between. Honors dorm is by far the nicest (just built in 2013 I think and it looks like a hotel) while the others are pretty much the same. In these dorms, yeah you'll see cockroaches, smell weird smells, hear lots of dubstep, but whatever, it's all part of the college experience. If for some reason you decide not to live in one of NJIT's halls, there is a university apartment building right next to NJIT that I hear has reasonable prices.}",

Am enjoying being here It can be a depressing school, weekends are dead, very little parties, but the city is a train ride away. Campus is safe. Food is horrible. Am learning a lot As an architecture major it is very hard to get a good nights rest. Unlike other majors, archies live in their studios and can stay in their for many days. There is a lot of work but there is an equal amount of learning when it comes to this school. Login to rate or flag the reviews",
