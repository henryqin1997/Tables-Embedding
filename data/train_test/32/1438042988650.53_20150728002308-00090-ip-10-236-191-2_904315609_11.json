            "Creighton is great for students who want to go on to professional school. The University is also great for students who like to study, but also have fun. Creighton is a hard university, but if you study regularly and get help when you need it you will do fine!!",
            "One tip is to go to every class. Do not skip class because the professors will notice. Another tip is to go to your professor when you need help because they want you to succeed. The best time to see your professor is just before a test because they can help you review the most important information and make you feel confident before going into the test period. Another tip is to make sure that you use your time wisely and make sure to stay on top of your homework and reading assignments so that you are not staying up until 3 in the morning the night before the assignment is due. Also if you start to feel home sick or overly stressed go see a counselor on campus because it is free to every student!!",
            "Creighton is very expensive, but they do give scholarships for students who deserve them. Creighton is more than an in-state university, however, it is cheaper than many other private universities. Freshman year is typically the most expensive because you do not receive as much money in scholarships. However, after freshman year there are many more scholarship opportunities to gain scholarships from Creighton. My parents and I do not have a lot of money, however for the education I am receiving is well worth it.",
            "Creighton is a lot of fun. Campus is great because there is constantly something going on. Some things that you can do are go to soccer games, baseball games, basketball games, and softball games. Home soccer games, girls basketball games, baseball games, and softball games are all on campus. The men's basketball games are at the Qwest Center which is close to campus and there are shuttles that will take students from campus to the game. All for FREE!! Every student can get into home games for free with their student ID. I also love that they wait until spring semester to do Rush.",
            "Creighton is a hard University if you don't study regularly, but it is well worth the effort. The core can seem daunting and you might believe that you will never get it done, but it does make you a very rounded person. There are a ton of classes available with great professors. The classroom sizes are smaller than any state school. There are usually around 25-30 students in small classrooms and during large groups the classroom size can get up to 50 students, but that is way smaller than a state school which has 100 students as its smallest class size. The smaller class size makes it way easier to learn a lot and to ask professors questions."

Soccer is huge here., 5464=If you are looking for a great-quality school in a homely city, then consider applying at Creighton University. Established as a Jesuit center of learning in 1878 in Omaha, Nebraska, the institution has done so much for its students. Not only does Creighton offer a great variety of liberal arts as well as pre-professional and professional classes, which are taught by the professors and not the teaching assistants, but it works very hard to provide an education that is as affordable as is possible. For example, because of this year's recession, the tuition is increasing by the smallest factor ever (almost all colleges raise the tuition yearly), and this fall has enrolled the most freshman that has ever been there. So, for those of you who find Creighton University appealing, get all the information you can about the school. Then, come visit the campus to step into the shoes of its students as they enjoy their college life mentally, physically, and spiritually., 206444=I have never felt unsafe on campus. I don't even feel uncomfortable crossing campus at 12:30 in the morning., 177244=W.A.C.: Wednesday After Class! Every wednesday from about 12-2:30 they have music playing and generally food or some fun craft on the mall! It definitely helps get through wednesdays!, 62912=Take the ACT test towards the end of your Junior Year. Also make sure you study for it. Apply earlier than December to reduce the stress of getting things in before the deadlines. Go to CU Sundays, and also make a personal college visit so that you can get all of your questions answered by the professors in the field of study you want to go into., 290951=When I enrolled at Creighton as a freshman in 2011, it was everything I had ever wanted. Its Jesuit values, academics, and extracurriculars are impressive, to say the least. Nowadays, I see it somewhat less rose-colored, but I in no way regret coming here or the four years past., 293539=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
