The Comptroller\u2019s office selected grant recipients based on each project\u2019s potential economic return to the state and on endeavors that involve dual-credit programs with local high schools or cooperative arrangements with other colleges. Priority was given to projects that target high-demand occupations and new or emerging industries. Launchpad Funds support Texas nonprofit organizations with programs that prepare low-income students for careers in high-demand technical occupations, such as welding, computer support, engineering technology, nursing and allied health professions. These organizations are governed by boards that include community and business leaders and assist low-income students preparing to attend public community colleges or technical schools. Nonprofit organizations receiving Launchpad Funds must be community-based 501(c)(3) organizations that provide matching funding and can demonstrate that they have achieved or will achieve success, with priority given to those with programs for veterans or partnerships with community colleges, business organizations or economic development organizations.
