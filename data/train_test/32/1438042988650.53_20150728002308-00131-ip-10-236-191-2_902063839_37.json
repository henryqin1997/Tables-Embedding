            "The security guards have eagle eyes. They don't carry guns though. No need to be Rambo. You HAVE to scan your student ID every single time you enter a SAIC facility. Annoying but necessary.",
            "...not that I know of.",
            "There are loads of student-driven clubs. Mostly art-oriented.",
            "Artsy. Creative. Motivated. Disciplined. Patient. RICH.",
            "Apparently, it's a thing for the hipsters to hang out in the garden below the dorms, smoke and discuss undiscovered bands every Wednesday after class. Welcome to art school.",
            "It's a lot of bang...but too much buck. You have to use your student ID to pay for your food, art supplies, and printing - which costs actual money. That stuff isn't prepaid or covered by financial aid. Just a heads up!",
            "...the city is our campus. You will end up having to hop a train to a different college's party. The RA's try to engage us...you know how those things are. -_-",
            "Despite the price, SAIC food can be grouped into 3 categories: Asian cuisine, greasy food or pastries. Period. You are better off with Ramen.",
            "Spectacular views!!! Spacious rooms, private bathrooms and kitchenettes. The building cleaning is on time. Maintenance is provided. Security is taken seriously.",
            "Work is taken seriously. I have yet to find a slacker. We all pay entirely TOO MUCH to spend our time here counting sheep or partying it up. No one is that loaded. The 2 absences and you fail the course rule helps keep everyone in line.",
            "Get 2 jobs: 1 on campus. 1 off-campus. Make use of the free workshops. Learn how to cook (food is expensive). Become acquainted with the Chicago trains and city life. Leave the contraband behind, they will find it; don't be stupid. Bring all your useless art supplies from home - you can thank me later.",
            "SAIC gets a 7/10 from me because it has no real campus experience and the cafeterias have no variety. Room, board, and facilities are lovely. Professors and lecturers are well-traveled and more than qualified."

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot I came into SAIC knowing very little about the modern art world. I was afraid of being surrounded by snobs who knew everything. I couldn't have been more wrong. Sure, the people who inhabit this small but renowned school have a fairly extensive knowledge of art, but they are happy to share and educate as long as the student is willing to learn. My eyes were opened to the kind of things considered art in today's world. The knowledge I have gained in only my first year will inform all other projects that I choose to create.
