He\u2019s an excellent example of what community college offers to people.\u201d \u00a0 Forsmark, 41, has served two hitches in the U.S. Army and worked as a painter to support his two daughters, also indulging in a brief stint as an undefeated cage fighter. The economic crisis a few years ago sent him looking for a better future. \u00a0 With his tuition covered by the GI Bill, he enrolled at PRCC\u2019s Forrest County Center in the fall of 2011. \u00a0 \u201cBeing here has really made my life worth living,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got so much more future. I know it\u2019s a cliche but the sky\u2019s the limit. What a great opprtunity I\u2019ve been given.\u201d \u00a0 Forsmark will receive the associate\u2019s degree in May and hopes to be accepted into the nursing school at the University of Southern Mississippi. He received the 2012 Outstanding Student in Sociology Award at the Forrest County Center. \u00a0 The HEADWAE honor stunned him. \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m very wowed by it,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d amount to much so this is quite an accomplishment for me. I\u2019m starting to believe I\u2019ve got a little bit of sense. I think if I could do it, anybody could do it. I\u2019m no smarter than anybody else.\u201d \u00a0 Runnels points to him as the personification of the community college purpose. \u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s a great representative of what community college is designed to do,\u201d she said. \u00a0 Runnels has taught at PRCC since 1990, with a break when her son was born, and at the Forrest County Center since 2000. The HEADWAE honor was unexpected, she said. \u00a0 \u201cI was pleasantly surprised,\u201d Runnels said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great honor. I\u2019m excited to represent our college. I feel honored that the college selected me.\u201d \u00a0 She holds the associate in arts degree from Hinds Community College, a bachelor\u2019s degree in mathematics from Mississippi College and a Master in Arts degree specifically for community college instructors from Mississippi State University. She has also completed 30 hours of post-graduate study at MSU and William Carey University. \u00a0 While working on her master\u2019s degree, Runnels was a teaching assistant. After receiving her degree, she taught finite math at MSU for a year while also teaching math classes for East Mississippi Community College at Columbus Air Force Base. \u00a0 Runnels came to PRCC\u2019s Poplarville campus in 1990 and began teaching two days a week at the Forrest County Center in 1997. \u00a0 \u201cI was the first permanent faculty member on this campus,\u201d she said. After time off with her baby, Runnels returned to the Forrest County Center full-time in 2000. \u201c\u00a0 At that time, we had a science teacher and a math teacher,\u201d she said. \u201cThe other people were adjunct instructors. I began to build the mathematics program and bring stability to the program. As the campus grew, we got additional faculty and were able to add a second math teacher.\u201d \u00a0 Runnels now chairs a department that includes seven full-time math instructors and is subject area coordinator for accounting, business, computer science, economics and mathematics. \u00a0 \u201cJacki\u00a0 has been a devoted teacher of mathematics for Pearl River Community College for several years,\u201d said Dr. Cecil Burt, PRCC vice president for Forrest County operations. \u201cShe currently is our department chair and has just worked tirelessly in that role. She is deserving of this kind of recognition.\u201d, 19508=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2013 by Pearl River Community College. All rights reserved.
