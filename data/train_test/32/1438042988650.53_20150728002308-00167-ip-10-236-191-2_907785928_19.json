            "siue has one of the safest campuses in illinois. there are plenty of on duty officers around campus at all times and the dorm rules also ensure safety.",
            "for fun, the fitness center has a lot of activities you can participate in and meet new people. you can hang out with friends, play sports with friends, work out, go swimming, rock climbing, bowling; just to name a few.",
            "there are different varieties of food available but it could be better. after a while, you just want something different because you eventually get tired of the campus food. luckily, there are other restaurants to order from but are not walking distance, so the buses and/or delivery comes in handy if you don't have a car.",
            "the dorms are really comfortable and safe. they're spacious and nothing like the usual college dorms that could be compared to a prison cell. there is around the clock staff to ensure safety at all times and friendly residence assistants.",
            "it's best to aim for a gpa of a 4.0 and don't fall under a 2.0. late work is unacceptable unless you have a good reason for it. unexcused absences also effects your grades so attend your classes everyday.",
            "tips for prospective students is to stay focus. college is not a place to slack off and fall behind. this is for your future, so don't waste your time and money if you're not serious about furthering your education.",
            "siue is a great school for students of all majors and brings you diversity in a safe environment. help is always provided if needed whether you would prefer help from a professor, another student, or a study group for any course. this is a challenging school but it is doable for anyone willing to accomplish their educational goals."
