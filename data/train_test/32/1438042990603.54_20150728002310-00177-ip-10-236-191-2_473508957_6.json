    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above, but encompasses any and all embodiments within the scope of the following claims. When the strip is applied to the surface of print media, e.g., by adhering to a business card or a magazine, the strip is provided with instructions indicating an appropriate time to release the volatile mixture. The user then inhales the volatile mixture to smell the scent and experience the effects of the behavior-modifying or mood-altering ingredient. The written instructions may specify a cue that occurs during playback of the medium. When the cue occurs, the user removes the protective peelable cover layer to release the volatile mixture. The user then smells the perceptible scent, e.g., a citrus or other odor, and experiences the desired modified behavior, such as increased libido or other stimulation caused by the substantially imperceptible behavior-modifying or mood-altering ingredient. shows an exploded view of the scent strip 210 with slits 230. The porous material 214 is encapsulated inside the strip and is protected by a peelable cover layer 212. Cover layer 212 includes a grip tab 216. Peelable bottom layer 220 has its own grip tab 226. The bottom layer 220 is removed to expose a layer of adhesive to apply the strip to the surface of a media, such as the casing of a DVD. FIG. 4",
