Usage Guidelines This command can be used with both Flexible NetFlow and Performance Monitor. These products use different commands to enter the configuration mode in which you issue this command, however the mode prompt is the same for both products. For Performance Monitor, you must first enter the flow record type performance-monitor command before you can use this command. Because the mode prompt is the same for both products, here we refer to the command mode for both products as flow record configuration mode. However, for Flexible NetFlow, the mode is also known as Flexible NetFlow flow record configuration mode; and for Performance Monitor, the mode is",
