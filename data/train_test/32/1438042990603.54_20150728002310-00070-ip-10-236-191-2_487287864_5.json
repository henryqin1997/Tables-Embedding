According to the present invention, the DC-DC converter has a stable output voltage regardless of the variation of the input voltage thereof and noises including harmonic wave components, and reliability of the DC-DC converter is improved. By adjusting the reference duty signal Dref based on the variation of the input signal Vin and sensing the variation of the inductor current in real-time so as to change the duty ratio of the switching control signal q1, the DC-DC converter 940 has a stable output voltage Vout regardless of the variation of the input voltage Vin and noises including harmonic wave components. That is, by adjusting the voltage level of the reference signal Dref based on the variation of the input voltage Vin, the duty ratios of the switching control signals q1 and q2 are varied. A switching period of the switching element Q1 of the DC-DC converter is changed based on the duty ratio of the signal q1, to control the output voltage Vout outputted from the DC-DC converter 940 and applied to the lamp",
