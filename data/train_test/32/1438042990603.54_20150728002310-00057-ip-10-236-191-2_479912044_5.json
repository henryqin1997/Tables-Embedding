No. 3,882,009., 41070=To a portion of the above-described latex is added sufficient diammonium hydrogen phosphate to adjust the conductivity to 1500 micromhos per centimeter, the pH is adjusted to 7.7 and the resulting formulation is diluted to 10 percent solids., 36987=A thermoplastic acrylic latex is prepared in the following manner. A monomer mixture is prepared from 960 grams of butyl acrylate and 640 grams of styrene and to this mixture is added 10 grams of an 82.7 percent solution of t-butylhydroperoxide to form a monomer feed solution. A seed latex is prepared from 750 grams of a surfactant solution previously prepared by stirring 745 grams of water and 5 grams of dodecylbenzyl-N,N,N',N'-tetramethylisothiouronium chloride for 2 hours under a stream of nitrogen to which is then added 25 grams of the monomer feed solution, followed by a continuously-added reducing stream pumped for about 2 hours at a rate of 7.67 grams per hour, the stream being a portion of a solution previously prepared from 9 grams of hydroxylamine hydrochloride diluted to 500 grams with deionized water. To the seed latex is added monomer feed solution at a rate of 55 grams per hour with continuation of a reducing stream of the same rate of addition and composition as in the seed latex and concurrently pumping into the reaction mixture at the rate of 20 grams per hour a surfactant solution previously prepared from 475 grams of deionized water and 25 grams of S-p-dodecylbenzyl-N,N,N',N'-tetramethylisothiouronium chloride. After 20 hours the monomer feed is stopped, 0.5 gram of tert-butylhydroperoxide is added and the reaction is continued for an additional 2 hours. The product is a clean, fluid latex having a solids content of 41.1 percent and a particle size of 1170 Angstroms., 43727=To a portion of that latex is added 0.1 milliequivalent of Surfactant Solution A per gram of solids, the latex is diluted to 10 percent solids, the conductivity is adjusted to 1500 with diammonium hydrogen phosphate, and the pH is adjusted to 7.6 with ammonium hydroxide. The resulting formulation is electrodeposited on zinc phosphated steel panels as described in Example 2 except that the electrical potential is 200 volts maintained for 2 minutes, rather than 150 volts for 30 seconds. During the process, the bath stability is good and there is very rapid current cut off. The very hydrophobic coating which is thus applied to the panel adheres very firmly during the water rinse. After drying, the coating is found to be 0.2 mil thick and the coating weight is 0.56 milligram per square centimeter., 36393=Electrodeposition processes in which the products of this invention may be used are described in our copending application, Ser. No. 392,700, filed Aug. 29, 1973, now U.S. Pat. No. 3,882,009 especially from page 13, line 11, through page 22.}",

There is rapid current cut off in the process. A very hydrophobic coating is obtained. After rinsing the coated panel with water and baking at 175\ufffd C for 20 minutes, the coating thickness is 1.3 mils and the coating weight is 4.6 milligrams per square centimeter. The formulated latex is mixed with 20 grams of an aqueous dispersion containing 50 percent of pigment of which 99 percent is titanium dioxide and 1 percent is carbon black (Raven 1500) and 0.1 milliequivalent of dodecylbenzyldimethylsulfonium chloride per gram of pigment; then the mixture is diluted with water to 360 grams. The aqueous dispersion of polybutadiene resin is formulated for use in electrodeposition by adding sufficient dodecylbenzyltetramethylisothiouronium chloride to bring the total to 0.2 milliequivalent per gram of resin, diluting the dispersion with water to 300 grams, raising the conductivity to 850 with diammonium hydrogen phosphate and adjusting the pH to 8.4 with ammonium hydroxide. An aqueous dispersion is prepared from 30 grams of a polybutadiene resin having a molecular weight of 3300 and 4 grams of an aqueous solution containing 0.73 milliequivalent of dodecylbenzyltetramethylisothiouronium chloride per gram of solution by slowly adding 66 grams of water with stirring, during which the system inverts to give a smooth, fluid emulsion containing 30 percent of",
