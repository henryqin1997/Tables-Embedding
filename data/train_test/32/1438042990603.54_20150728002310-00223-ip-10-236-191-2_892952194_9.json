            "Campus security is water tight, and is always around to handle any potential issues.",
            "There are tons of student organizations on campus to get involved with.",
            "Students that are looking to study the Bible, that are committed to Christ, that want to learn how to live for Christ more, and are really interested in finding friends that will call them out and build them up to live a life more honorable to Christ.",
            "The Bible education you are getting is the best one around, so it is worth the money. If you are coming here strictly for you academic major though, it probably isn't worth it, because so few of the professors studied things outside of the Bible for their PhD.",
            "There is always some sort of student sponsored event going on on campus, and the soccer games are fun as well.",
            "The food is not the best, but there are plenty of selections so you're always bound to find something you'll like to eat in the caf.",
            "Dorm life is great. People are great. Living on campus is wonderful.",
            "There are a few difficult classes in the Bible major, but other than that the only challenging majors are Humanities, Psychology, and Biblical Languages. Not much else is academically rigorous at all.",
            "Make sure you ask lots of questions about the major you think you're entering before you come to CIU. Sometimes the way majors sound to prospective students is not the way it actually is. Ask questions about what specific courses you will be taking while enrolled.",
            "CIU has the greatest campus life and community of any college I've ever heard of. The people here (both students and faculty/staff) are loving, awesome individuals. CIU is a great place to be."

I thoroughly enjoy my classes at CIU as well my major and the wonderful faculty and professors. I love learning so much more about the Bible and also acquiring hands on experiences in my youth ministry classes., 40498=I have now been attending Columbia International University since August 2010 and I realize it was and is the best decision I could have ever made knowing that my relationship with Christ Jesus would grow stronger, I joined the CIU family because of the Lord's leading; the school's reputation and the family-oriented atmosphere I felt in 2009 when my decision was finally made to attend. I am truly grateful for every person I come in contact with because it brings me closer to the LORD in prayer; not only in prayer, but it has given me an even greater understanding of His Word and a closer relationship., 23866=CIU is a small, close-knit community (about 600 students) committed to preparing students to serve God. The professors care about students and do a good job teaching. CIU will be entering intercollegiate athletics for the first time in 2013., 60567=My number one recommendation to high school seniors is to participate in the McQuilkin Scholarship Weekend. It is in the first weekend of December and is an excellent way to meet fellow students, get to know the campus and faculty, and to receive scholarships for tuition., 38640=I am an off campus student. Dorm life on campus for both male and female is good. All rooms have been renovated; updated in 2011-12., 5410=If you are interested in CIU, the best way to get to know the school for real is to pop in and spend time with current students. If you have a friend who attends CIU, plan to unofficially spend a day or two with them to get a taste for the school. Another great option is applying to attend the R.C. McQuilkin Scholarship weekend for highschool seniors that is usually held in November or December every year., 39508=As a prospective student seeking to join the Columbia International University, I say to you seek the LORD in your decision; trust the LORD in your decision and finally step out on Faith believing that the decision you've made or have been given by the Holy Spirit will be the right one. If your choice is Columbia International University in Columbia, SC, then I will tell you this, you have made the right decision. It is a league of compassionate Professors, Teachers and Staff you will come to know and hopefully love. I know I have for the four years I cut into 2-1/2 years as a transfer student. I will graduate (if it is the LORD's will) December 2012. The President of our school -Dr. Bill Jones has a heart of gold. He's compassionate and CARES as so many of the professors, teachers and staff do.}",

What to do for fun Fun activities at CIU can consist but are not limited to campus events, dances, movie nights in the auditorium, and sports events. At CIU there is always something to be involved in for fun . Many students go off campus to the local shopping areas, parks, or just stay on campus and play frisbee. Food and Dining The food and dining at CIU can easily be identified to promote a sense of unity and community. There is always different types of food each day that appeal to the diversity that we have at CIU. The dining room has big, medium, and small table to accommodate any size",
