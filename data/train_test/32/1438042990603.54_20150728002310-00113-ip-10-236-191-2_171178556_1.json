Hey maybe he does become a Morse and figures it out in his late 20's\u2026. March 12, 2012 1:52 PM You don't put Brown on the 40 man if you are going to option him back to AAA.Brown could be your 15 seed beating a 2. Ankiel can't stay healthy so who knows. When Corey Brown is healthy, the kid is good and is a solid 3 1/2 tool player. If he can hit for average, he would be the guy., 30432=Mark'd, I have to make some assumptions such as platoon splits so I took Bernadina playing 72% of the time and Bourgeois 28% of the time and only used their 2011 stats w/ Bernadina facing RH pitching and Bourgeois vs. LH pitching and the results are: .297/.353/.426/.779If you used their respective numbers from 2011 against all pitchers and batting 2nd: .317/.353/.516/.869I don't have the ability to neutralize those numbers taking out LH/LH matchups and RH/RH matchups in the 2 hole, but you can imagine how good both players numbers would look. Both players performed poorly in leadoff in 2011., 33179=Actually, Anonatwit @ 1:11, Mark does the same thing. He goes down to talk to the starting pitcher when he comes out after the third, so there is usually a gap in the game blog. Also, since Mark is not currently in Viera, he won't be updating at all, but the play-by-play provided by (in no particular order) Gonat, MicheleS and natsfan1a more than make up for it. It's almost as good as being there, 128724=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC. Images provided by Getty Images. Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 1707=ST. LOUIS CARDINALS (ss) vs. WASHINGTON NATIONALS Where: Space Coast Stadium, Viera Gametime: 1:05 p.m. TV: None Radio: None Weather: Partly cloudy, 74 degrees, Wind 15 in from LF, 98037='Anonymous' at 4:05pm seems to have missed the fact that Burnett posted a 1.02 ERA for the entire months of August and Sept. last season over his last 19 appearances after a late July adjustment. That was the best ERA over that span for the entire staff, starters or relievers (with the exception of Stammen, but he only made 5 appearances, all in Sept.). Like Davey said of Burnett at the end of Sept., \"He was as good as anyone I had out there\" (And in fact, he was better). Burnett isn't going anywhere., 92892=Humph\u2026\u2026 Why didn't I think of that? We'll just pick up a Prince Fielder, who can field the position\u2026. How hard can that be? Just dangle that Cutter Dykstra bait out there, until somebody strikes it. Seems likely to be filled eventually by an older free agent until/unless Skole begins to prove himself.Possible better-than-fielder examples: 1. Joey Votto (heard of him Unkyd? Probably not you don't really follow well. FA 2014.2. Lance Berkman FA 2013., a switch hitting impact hitter., 25725=sjm308 -If Brown doesn't have a serious shot at making the 25 man roster\u2013and I doubt he does\u2013then, yes, I'd think they send him down to minor league camp sooner rather than later, to get more looks at the guys who are contenders. Last year, the Nats made their first round of cuts on March 11, and sent Bryce down a day later.Anon @ 12:50 \u2013 That's an interesting idea\u2013that they're showcasing Brown in major league camp as possible trade bait. But he seems like a pretty marginal trading chip, and I doubt another club would put a lot of weight on 10-15 ST ABs., 26908=P2P, does anyone have the ability to put together what Bernadina + Bourgeois would slash in a platoon combined based on 2011., 102279=Belated answer to you NI questioners \u2014 yes it was a double steal. And Corey Brown 's diving catch and doubling off Yadier Molina was a nice make up for his sort-of hesitating attempt to do so in the first that bounced off his glove and put the first runner on for Freese's bomb. no worse than Wirth's lollygagging on that hit that fell in for a double against the Mets on Saturday, tho.I thought the kid looked impressive, though, like he belonged. And probably will by September if not July.ANd to all you HRod doubters, fuggetabowdit! Missed seeing NatsJack today but had the fun of watching HRod's howitzer shots come in from behind the screen, and yelling \"swing NOW\" at Velez during HRod's windup.

Click here for past audio clips., 22277=http://districtondeck.com/2012/03/12/the-jason-bourgeois-rumor/The writer in this article like others are looking at Bourgeois as a full-time player which he isn't. Last week here I read some interesting points on why Rizzo may want him and that is to create a RH/LH platoon with the lefties Ankiel or Bernadina or Harper.Bourgeois is one of the best base stealers in the Majors. He is one of the most effective batters when facing LH pitching. The issues are what would it cost to get him and how much of a factor is his age (30)., 32355=Anon @ 1:16 who is quick to smash Jordan Z, Dave Nichols tweeted that the Freese HR off of JZim was a wind-aided opposite field HR. Some call it hitting the jet stream.Basically a Nats Park fly ball out.}",
