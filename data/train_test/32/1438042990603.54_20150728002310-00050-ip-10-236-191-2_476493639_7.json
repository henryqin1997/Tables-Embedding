When the input data is the image data, the conversion table designates color codes on the basis of the gradations of shades of colors, cyan, magenta and yellow input to prepare two-dimensional color codes. When restored image data is obtained from the two-dimensional color code, the gradations of shades of colors can be easily obtained by the reverse conversion. Moreover, when the relation between the data content of input data and the color code is stored in advance in the conversion table, it is possible to prepare the color code merely by referring to the conversion table by the code conversion section. The two-dimensional color code printed on the printing sheet as described above is provided with synchronous timing data or error correcting code whereby reading by the reading section can be done accurately and stably. The restoring apparatus is possible to obtain restored image data and restored voice data merely by performing the process reverse to the process in which the two-dimensional color code is prepared by the preparing apparatus. Therefore, these preparing apparatus and restoring apparatus can be used in common by",
