Accordingly, the scope of this invention is to be considered limited only by the following claims. By utilizing the present invention, retention loads of up to 500 pounds have been obtained during Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 207 test. To retain the crossbar 24 inside of the retainer, there is a locking finger 56. The locking finger may be pulled out of position by pulling on tab 58 by placing one's finger through the loop 60. This pulling in a forward direction allows the locking finger 56 to be pulled into a well 62 formed in the retainer. Internal reinforcing ribs 66 and 68 help provide additional rigidity as well as preventing any portion of the frame 20 from impinging on the front or rear walls 30 and 28. Additionally, the collar 36 has a flange portion 50 to aid in sealing the aperture 18. This flange is also placed in a slight interference by virtue of the top of the lock ramps 32 and 34 being in contact with the underside of the rigid floor panels 16. The rear wall 28 also has an alignment stud 52 which fits within an opening 54 of the front wall (FIG. 3) to help ensure the proper",
