            "My tips for prospective students would be to prepare ahead of time for what may come, and to visit the campus, as they may be able to feel the community vibe that UNC carries.",
            "One of my primary reasons for attending UNC in the first place stems from all that I had heard about the Performance Arts program here. UNC may not be the best acting school in the country (if you're looking for that, I'd suggest an observatory), but considering the price, I do believe that it presents one of the best values in the country for this sort of thing. UNC provides skilled training at an affordable cost.",
            "So far at UNC I have made solid friends, been involved in two groups for improvisational comedy, developed a love for philosophy as a subject, and experienced a sense of individuality that I don't think I've ever known before. It really is something special when you realize that you're living through what will one day be some of your fondest memories.",
            "Not only have I picked up quite a bit going to UNC as far as my classes have gone (all of which have been highly informative), but I have been placed in an environment where it just feels right to continue into the ways of reality and adulthood."

Grades as well as extracurricular activities will get you into UNC. Stay out of trouble as well, enjoy your senior year of high school, but do not get into trouble because you do not want to miss out on a great college experience especially at UNC. The last thing to let you know is apply for financial aid. Get as much as you possibly can even if they are loans. Do not let money keep you from attending UNC. If you have financial aid questions the UNC Financial Aid office will help you. UNC Also gives out grants and scholarships to incoming freshmen. They have a Universal scholarship application that you can fill out in January once you create an Ursa account. Again to get those scholarships and grants you need the grades and extracurricular activities. YOU REALLY NEED TO FILL OUT A FASFA FORM AS WELL!!!, 484780=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
