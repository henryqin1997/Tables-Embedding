The subject invention is not limited to the particular forms herein shown and described except insofar as indicated by the scope of the appended claims. Lastly, the preferred method of fabrication would be injection molding for high volume low cost production. The material used could be any of a variety of materials such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester, nylon, etc. that are compatible with the injection molding process. , in the preferred embodiment, the fluid powered bubble machine of the subject invention is mounted on a base with bubbles being blown from one end and fluid emanating from the other. However, other embodiments of the subject invention could readily be adapted to have the fluid emanate from a vertical fluid tank and the bubble blowing portion of the machine could be mounted above the fluid tank so as to increase the elevation of the bubbles being blow. The entire machine could also be readily adapted to take the from of a fire hydrant, a cartoon character, or other aesthetically pleasing shape.
