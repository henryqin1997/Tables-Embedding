Many adhesives and other fluids will not accept excessive shear, with the result that the extruder valve piston will not reciprocate., 14801=In the art of fluid deposition on moving surfaces it is well known to use a two-way poppet valve with a single fluid supply input to the valve assembly. One such is described, for example, in the \"Extruder Valve\" 1977 bulletin of Acumeter Laboratories, the assignee of the present invention. A pressure relief valve, located at the source fluid pump, relieves any excess pressure when the two-way poppet valve is closed. Upon opening the poppet valve to apply fluid to the moving surface, the internal pressure discharges, causing a sudden surge with subsequent dropoff of pressure and fluid displacement. This effect in turn causes a heavy deposit and then a light deposit on the surface being coated.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes While the invention has been explained in connection with a preferred construction and mode of operation, it should be understood that modifications will occur to those skilled in this art that are considered to fall within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. If a nozzle N is connected to the exit port 9 of the three-way poppet valve assembly 1, as shown, to distribute fluid evenly over the width of a moving surface R, such as the before-mentioned rotating roller or a moving web or the like, the present invention provides for rapidly changing the on/off characteristics of the fluid flow upon such surface. This allows small discrete or periodic coatings to be obtained on a rapidly moving surface and from a constant fluid supply flow from the source S. Since the internal fluid pressure in the chamber 5 is kept constant, a uniform coating thickness is obtained over the entire coated portion of the moving surface. In view of the fact that the piston head 12 in conjunction with the forward seat 8 blocks the exit port 9 from the internal chamber 5, the only excess fluid that can remain in the nozzle N is that held in the exit port 9. Since that amount of fluid is small, a minimum of after-drool results on the moving surface R when the coating operation is ceased. The air",
