            "Campus police patrol the campus everyday, 24/7. They also work with the City Police Department in order to keep the school, and community surrounding the school safe.",
            "No Sororities or Fraternities.",
            "There are many clubs that replace Sororities and Fraternities, and many other organizations also. All of these are great ways to meet people, and everyone in them always speaks of having great times and having made great friends in them.",
            "Every kind of student, there is a place for everyone.",
            "It's totally worth it, the community is nice, the knowledge is amazing and amazing people are teaching/channeling that knowledge to the students. I recommend ACU to anyone who wants a five star education and to have a good time getting it!",
            "Chill with friends, hang out in the library (who would have thought?), go to the mall in town, participate in campus put-on activities, go to the local lakes.",
            "The food is good and not like most cafeteria food, the menu changes every meal, every day. The staff is nice and completely helpful. I've gained my Freshman 15 already!",
            "The dorm life is awesome! I have met great people and made many friends through my dorm life. There are generally monthly activities either for each floor or for the whole dorm, and its always a good time when a group of guys gets together.",
            "The courses are made to get the students where they need to be for the work force. Therefore, they are not simple. Students must pay attention, ask questions (clarify), and study. All this can be done while still having a great time and allowing down time.",
            "1) Be prepared to be amazed by the family like community. 2) Be yourself, you'll fit in. 3) Study, but make some time for fun.",
            "ACU is an extraordinary place of learning. The professors and students all focus on helping others and making each and every person the best they can be. The fact that their mission is to input Christian people into the workforce to make a difference and reveal God's glory every day is the reason I attend ACU."

Make sure you go to chapel so you will not be one of those people who are scrounging for chapel credits at the end of November. With your roommate make sure y'all talk your problems out so there's not any built up hostility. When you're filling out the survey for housing do not lie on it because it will only make things hard on you. And when you and your roommate meet go over the boundaries nod expectations so there isn't any misunderstandings., 306843=The best tradition is opening chapel, more commonly referred to as the Harry Potter chapel because all the professors come out in their doctoral robes. They march in all of the flags that represent staff or students from different countries, held by students from that countries as well as all the state flags. There are speeches and singing and it is just a great way to kick off the year., 387319=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 20713=At ACU the classes are always interesting and intriguing. The professors are excellent and are always up to date on current issues and events within their field of expertise as well as others and will combine this into the curriculum. The classes are interactive and this has been increased some by the Global Learning Initiative that was implemented in 2008-2009 school year that gave incoming Freshmen the choice between a paid for iTouch or iPhone (service not included with phone). This increased students ability to communicate with professors and peers which in turn increased student to professor feed back. Thus, increasing the overall learning experience. I have learned a lot while at ACU and look forward to learning much more., 203222=Every February there is an interesting event called Sing-Song. You are able to find videos/more information online. My favorite locations to visit on campus include the computer labs with large Apple computers, the basement of the library, the prayer room (equipped with a waterfall!) in the Bible building, the patio near the fountain lake, and all of the various cafes throughout campus., 97796=There are so many options of getting involved at ACU. SingSong, a lively tradition since 1956, is a time where clubs and classes show off their musical talent for parents, the student body, and visitors every spring time. Another way to get involved is Freshmen Follies, a type of Talent Show specifically for freshmen who want to get to know other freshmen and have a blast on stage. Before the start of their first year, everyone participates in what we call Welcome Week; this is a time where small groups participate in events with each other like the Welcome Week Olympics and perhaps the largest game of Twister in the world! Of course there are so many other ways to have fun and get to know your peers; examples include club activities, dances, intramural sports, etc.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here I enjoyed being in the college so much, that as I'm home in Dallas for the summer, I'm anxious to get back to ACU! The atmosphere at ACU is so friendly and inviting; Abilene, very quickly became home to me. Both the students, the faculty, and the staff seem to share the same ideal of making a difference in the world, and when I was on campus I easily desired the same goal. I have very much enjoyed my first-year experience at ACU because I made many great friends and great connections, that I'm sure will last my life-time. Am learning a lot The professors here truly care about their students' education. In most of my classes I attended my first year, there were a lot of discussions in the classes; in addition to learning the information in the textbooks, the professors allowed us (the students) to discuss our many different perspectives. All of the information I learned in class, was useful to not just pass the course, but to apply to my everyday life. I especially appreciated learning new ideas in a Christian setting.
