It\u2019s a long road to profitability, but hey, this is a start.

    "textAfterTable": "\u00a0 For many movies, a $28 million opening would be considered very strong, but \u2018Ender\u2019s Game\u2019 is just expensive enough for that number to be a little underwhelming. If it wants to make back its $110 million budget, it\u2019s going to need strong legs and an enthusiastic audience. Considering the generally mixed reactions to the film, it\u2019s going to be a tough road, but not an unsurmountable one. Let\u2019s see what happens next weekend. \u2018Bad Grandpa\u2018 fell to second place, but there\u2019s no shame in $20 million and a 36% drop. There\u2019s especially no shame in the $62 million made so far, especially since this Johnny Knoxville comedy was made for pennies. This will definitely not be the last time the \u2018Jackass\u2019 brand heads back to the big screen. In third place, the star-studded \u2018Last Vegas\u2018 opened to an unremarkable $16 million, a number that\u2019s especially surprising when you consider the line-up of movie stars on the poster and the easy-to-sell core concept (\u2018The Hangover\u2019 with old people!). However, this is the kind of film whose audience doesn\u2019t always head out on opening weekend. This one may be okay in the coming weeks as older crowds make their way to the theater. What can we say about the $16 million opening for \u2018Free Birds\u2019? On one level, that\u2019s not bad for a hideously reviewed, terribly marketed animated cheapie about time traveling turkeys. On another level, that\u2019s just plain bad for an animated movie, especially since",
