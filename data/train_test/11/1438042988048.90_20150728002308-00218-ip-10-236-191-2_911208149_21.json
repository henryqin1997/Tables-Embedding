            "Security does a great job with helping students from giving rides across campus when it's raining to patrolling campus if there are potential threats. A safe campus overall, there are not a lot of dangers here. One time, we did have a bear come on campus, but that was taken care of quickly and no harm came to anyone.",
            "NONE",
            "They have everything from Zombie battles to boxing tournaments. Just have to sign up and see what is coming up. The campus Residence directors are always trying to get people involved. There's volunteer opportunities and work opportunities, internships and other ways to get involved.",
            "Thespians, Athletes, Outdoors men/women, Music majors, and that's about it.",
            "Top of the World, one of the prettiest spots I have ever seen. It's a drive up to the mountain to see over Tennessee. It's absolutely beautiful at night. Probably some of my happiest memories are at the Top of the World.",
            "We are 30 minutes from Knoxville and 30 minutes from the Smoky Mountains. If you enjoy the more outdoorsy stuff there is always hiking, biking, canoeing, and things like that if you want to make a short drive. Being 30 minutes from Knoxville is nice because it's near the University of Tennessee campus and near things like theaters and malls. There is always stuff to do if you are willing to do a little exploring and find it.",
            "There are two places to eat on campus, Pearson's and Isaac's. Isaac's is more like fast food, it's nice if you want to grab a quick bite or if you want a late night meal because they stay open until 11pm. Pearson's is like a buffet and they have new stuff to offer everyday. The food is getting better, we are supposed to get a new service provider with better options and better quality. So the food on campus is progressing. As an upper class man you will have a small kitchen, so if you like to cook occasionally there is that option after freshman year.",
            "They are clean, they are small, they are tight knit and responsible resident assistance. The co-ed freshmen building is probably one of the best dorms to get in as a freshmen. Over the next four years the rooms are apartment style and a little more self reliant when it comes to keeping clean. When you get into the upper class men dorms it becomes easy to do laundry because you have the elevators. In the freshmen buildings there are no elevators so the stairs make doing laundry an all day task. The people are pretty cool in general, you get to say 'hi and meet people from everywhere.",
            "I think this school is challenging. Not all of the freshmen courses seem that rigorous, however, as the years progress the more difficult the courses will be. This school is designed to test you on how well your present information. If you are not a writer this is not the school for you. There are essays upon essays every week you have at least one per class. This school does not believe in scan trons, I did not see one until the end of the year when we had to do teacher evaluations. So if you are not the type of person who does not want to write this will be a difficult school for you to go to.",
            "The school is extremely small, it is best to learn who your friends are and stick with them the best you can. The school can get really clicky and become exclusive to people and groups of people. I also recommend finding activities that suit your interests, this school has a lot to offer from work opportunities to on campus events.",
            "The school's academics are fantastic. The school offers great athletic programs, intramurals, and other activities for the outdoors man. There is always something to do on campus."

Also, at night, the lighting is amazing. There isn't a single dark spot where you feel unsafe. Another good thing is that since it is such a small campus, you end up knowing everyone or at least know them enough to recognize, so people quickly identify someone that does not belong.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Did enjoy being here This college's student body puts on a show for unity and commradery however this is only true for some. For some it is an insular, elitist community rife with awkward, disingenuous, and uncomfortable social experiences. The student body is highly polarized in political and religious thinking; its hard to live a neutral, questioning perspective and not be alienated by both sides because of your lack of apparent zeal. Dormitory living for is dirty and unpleasant, and you WILL have pay community-issued fines for actions of random hooligans that you could not have possibly have influenced. The cafeteria food was unpalatable and unhealthy. Combining all these aggravations with the dissatisfaction of the science program sums up my negative opinion of this institution. Did learn a lot This school has excellent, highly respectable teachers mixed with terribly inept teachers and teaching assistants. I've had great teachers in the general education curriculum that have had profound impact on my perspective of education, but my experience here was also spoiled by new, young, recently graduated teachers that did not teach the course adequately and was never clear on his evaluation processes. The library is outdated, the campus computer network is weak and slow, and science department buildings were less furnished than my public high school.",
