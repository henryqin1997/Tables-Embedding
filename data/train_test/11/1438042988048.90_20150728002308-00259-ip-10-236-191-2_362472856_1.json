Pre-question Sometimes a husband is annoyed or angered by things that his wife does. In your opinion, is a husband justified in hitting or beating his wife in the following situations: Literal question If she burns the food? Interviewer instructions In this module, we have only one question, which asks for the woman's opinion on domestic violence. Note that we are not asking whether the woman has been subjected to domestic violence. Research has shown, however, that there is overall agreement in the proportion of women who think that a husband may be justified in hitting or beating his wife in certain situations, and the actual prevalence of domestic violence. The correlation may be on a societal level, and not on an individual level. Read each item aloud. For each situation, circle the code corresponding to the answer given - '1' if 'Yes' (she thinks the husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife in that situation), '2' if 'No', and '8' if the respondent does not know or does not have an opinion.
