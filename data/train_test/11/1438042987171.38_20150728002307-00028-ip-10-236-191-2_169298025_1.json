Mine seem to be endless. Really stupidly designed (years ago I did Web design before it was called \"Web design\" so I know stupidity when I see it.) The latest is when I redeemed for a ticket for August 3 (TODAY!!) the email came back with a ticket for October 3. Am trying to untangle it in the next hour because I got a good seat under the overhang in case it's hot or it rains. Otherwise I will have to buy a ticket\u2026, 53892=Agree entirely JD. He's got nastier stuff than, well, anyone, and he's probably pitching as well as anyone would expect him to pitch at this point, being 23 and in his first year back from TJ. We've seen this before (with Zimmnn) and we should expect him to be dominant in 2013. But the shutdown in 2012 isn't going to hurt the Nats as much as Eckersley or some others think, imo., 14824=Lombo and Bryce both made the top ten list for D.Daily Dashhttp://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=23572915, 116578=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows. Here's the 2015 schedule (subject to change)... MON: 12:45 p.m. TUE: 2:30 p.m. WED: 4:30 p.m. THU: 2:30 p.m. FRI: 5:30 p.m. SAT: 10:30 a.m. *All times Eastern. You can also listen to the station on 94.3 FM, 92.7 FM and online at ESPN980.com. Click here for past audio clips., 50765=Three. That's the number of starters in the Nats rotation that have been better than Stephen Strasburg since Detwiler returned to the rotation in late June (7 starts)., 87841=Hmm, let's play rank the contracts for the 11 pitchers (including E-Jax) that JD mentions by size of per year payout. No guesses on amounts necessary. Bonus points for correctly predicting the number of multi-year contracts, as opposed to one year contracts. I'll collect and save the entries and announce the winners next spring! One entry per customer, deadline is August 31. Winner gets a beer. Second place gets a coke., 57852=I think ManBearPig's original comment was intended as a concise response to the \"experts\" who want to talk about the Stras Shutown and how it will doom the Nats this year, instead of our other pitchers who deserve more attention and set us up well to compete in October without Stras. And he's absolutely right., 18185=Man, so many great points to think about in that last post.Jackson \u2013 I am for signing him but I am betting he will want more than 3 years. I don't think it will be the money but the years that make it difficult for us. I am not worried about blocking our young guys, the more pitching you have the better. Can you imagine going into next year with the same 5 starters we end with this year. I would think that is a luxury most teams don't have.Catcher \u2013 I like what Leon has done since coming back and last nights tag showed me he has learned something. I think he calls a good game and with what we have coming back from injury I would not be looking at making any kind of moves at this position.CF \u2013 still think that between Harper and Werth we have that covered.LaRoche \u2013 I defended him all last spring and love that he has proved to be so valuable. Even if he was not hitting like he usually did his defense has been just a pleasure to watchThird Base \u2013 I just got through praising LaRoche and I know we have him under control for next year (at least I think we do), but after that I am actually thinking that Zimm just might work well there. He has great hands and instincts. For those that played much more baseball than I, how tough would that transition be?Excited to see two games for the price of one. Will be making major decisions on those playoff strips with my partners in 308. I have no idea where I will sit for that first game since my ticket is for the 7:05 game. I will cross that bridge when I get to it.Go Nats and will be looking forward to polite bashing of my thoughts., 71942=Sec 3, I enjoyed the heck out of my last season in the opera, too. But there came a moment when the hours spent dressing up as a geisha wore on me and I thought, this is a game for younger ladies\u2026 Then I was happy with my jazz group for a long time until the hassle of recruiting and keeping drummers outweighed the joy. (Drummers are like catchers, they will make you a start, but they sure are hard to keep around.) Then I was happy with weddings and funerals, and various church and synagogue jobs until the weekly grind (and getting up at 5:30 on Sunday morning) got tiring. Last week at the students' recital, they asked me to sing a number, and I enjoyed showing off my stuff. But, in the end, I got more pleasure from my students showing off their stuff, even if it didn't thrill the audience like mine. My conclusion is\u2013we don't know. If it's still fun for Davey and his health holds up, he might stay. But if the hassle outweighs the fun, it's time to turn it over and \"consult\" again., 25381=Espinosa has cooled off on both sides of the plate. For the time being, Lombardozzi is a better lead-off option than Werth, at least from the left side, and he's playing every day. All the time we hear from former players how important it is to keep guys in the same spot in the batting order so that everyone understands and gets comfortable in their roles. So my inclination would be to leave Lombardozzi at the top unless Espinosa starts running into pitches again. And leave Werth in the six-hole so that he can get in a groove. Like #4 on the previous thread, I think the Nats may be stuck w/ Lannan as Jackson's replacement next season. Strasburg might improve next year, and Detwiler might give you 30 starts, but that filling that No. 5 spot with the typical 4-5 starter available by trade or free agency is going to leave a huge whole in the rotation every five games. And it is correct that there is no young stud ready to come up from the minors. (Don't tell me Rosenbaum; he hasn't had a good start in over a month.) If the Lerners can afford $5MM so that Lannan can spend a year on the beach at Syracuse they can afford $4MM for him to start every five or so days. So they should tender him and see what happens in arbitration. Unless he goes 5-0 in September (and I don't think he'll get that many starts) there's no way an arbitrator is going to give him a raise for spending the remainder of the year at AAA. (Like everyone else, I assume the Nats won't give Jackson multiple years, espec. w/ Z'mann soon becoming a $10-12MM/year player.), 73600=JD said\u2026 I don't really give a c**p about what the experts are saying about SS shutdown. Rizzo is firm and Davie supports him and that's why we are in such good hands.Rizzo is going to shut down (with Davey's support) for the same reason Rizzo didn't make any rash trades this week: because his job is (and he has the guts to stick to it despite any pressure) to build the team into a lasting dynasty, not a 2012-flash in the pan. He's not going to sacrifice the future for 2012.As for Davey: I expect he will retire after a WS ring (unless that happens this year \ud83d\ude09 ), 129212=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC.

Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 997=Jayson Werth returned to the Nationals lineup on Thursday night 88 days after he broke his left wrist sliding to catch a line drive in right field at Nationals Park. The day was May 6th and the Nats were playing the Phillies and pitcher Cole Hamels. On the day of his return, Aug. 2, the Phillies were the opponent once again and Hamels was on the mound.}",
