However, performance and usability varies greatly - see the following section for performance details. MPEGPlayer works on all current targets apart from the Archos devices (use Supported Targets MPEGplayer is included in the standard Rockbox installation and does not need to be downloaded separately. NOTE: Viewer plugins like MPEGplayer do not appear in the Browse Plugins menu - they are launched by selecting a file to be viewed in the normal file browser. Like all plugins documented on this website, Download NOTE: MPEGplayer does all video and audio decoding using your device's main CPU. It does not use any special video decoding hardware such as the Broadcom Video Processor found in the iPod Video. MPEGplayer therefore performs very badly on such devices in comparison with the manufacturer's original firmware. To play a video file, you simply select it in the Rockbox file browser.

    "textAfterTable": "Current Limitations Audio decoding and .mpg file parsing were added to MPEGplayer on 1 January 2007. A/V Sync and rebuffering were added in March 2007. Seeking and WVS were added January 2008. This is still a work-in-progress and is missing or could have the following major features: * Full-time remote WVS on targets with LCD remotes - the status can always be displayed on the remote and the WVS on the main display kept hidden (optionally and if the remote is actually plugged). * Seeking in raw video streams is not supported since they contain no time information and obtaining that would require a full file scan when opening the file. However, seeking is supported for MPEG Program Streams that have no audio stream. Anyone is welcome to download the source and implement these features. Keep true to program structure and threading practice in order to keep it maintainable, well-factored and reliable regarless of target's threading implementation.
