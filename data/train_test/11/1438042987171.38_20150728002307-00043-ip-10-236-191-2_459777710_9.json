May be required for efficient terminal myeloid maturation of hematopoietic cells. Has quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase activity (in vitro)., 59649=This gene encodes a member of the cupin superfamily. The encoded protein is an Fe(II)-containing nuclear protein expressed in all tissues of the body and concentrated within dot-like subnuclear structures. Interactions with nuclear factor I/CCAAT box transcription factor as well as B cell lymphoma 3-encoded oncoprotein suggest the encoded protein may act as a transcriptional cofactor and be involved in the regulation of DNA transcription and replication. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]}",
