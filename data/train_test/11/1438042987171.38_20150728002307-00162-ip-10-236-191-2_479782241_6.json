In a typical urban environment it has been observed that systems such as IS-95, IS-2000, W-CDMA etc. have a transmission bandwidth larger than the coherence bandwidth. In terms of diversity and robustness this means that these systems are more resilient to delay spread. The larger the bandwidth the larger is the diversity due to frequency selective nature of the channel. This conclusion inherently assumes that the rest of the physical layer and the control plane is designed such that channel estimation is quite accurate and adaptive to the channel. If however this be not the case, then some of the advantages of the frequency selective nature of the channel will be lost.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{86682=At the receiver, the analog signal is converted to a digital signal through a match filter (matched to the pulse shaping filter 307 at the transmitter). In the case of the downlink model for CDMA systems, such as IS-95, cdma2000 and W-CDMA, all of the received signals (from the same base station) may be modeled with the same channel function h and same propagation delay \u03b6. In the uplink, however, the different signals are treated in an asynchronous manner. In other words, each channel function h and propagation delay \u03b6 are different for each of the different users., 119825=In CDMA systems, when the spreading code s is the same for each data bit, the chip sequence c[0038] is independent of i. Each of the signatures p is therefore received only on the channel parameters that vary from one bit to the next. Although embodiments of the invention include different channel estimation schemes, for purposes of simplifying the explanation, a stationary channel model is assumed. For example, in W-CDMA, a long scrambling code (e.g., repeating every 10 msec. frame) may be replaced with a short scrambling code (e.g., repeating once every 0.2604 \u03bcsec. symbol). Furthermore, representation of the discrete time signal at the receiver assumes that the signal is sampled only once per chip. However, alternative detector structures for CDMA may sample the signal at alternative rates, including a rate higher than the chip duration, i.e., multiple samples per chip., 31738=CDMA systems include direct sequence CDMA (DS-CDMA), or direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS), and frequency hopping CDMA. DS-CDMA, in particular, codes transmitted signals in sequential channels, combining the transmitted bits with a higher sampling rate chip sequence and spreading the signal according to a spreading ratio. Because each bit is, in essence, redundantly represented by multiple chips, a spread DS-CDMA data signal is more likely to be recovered by the receiver, even when portions of the data are lost or encounter interference during transmission. DS-CDMA includes various conventional coding schemes, such as IS-95, cdma2000 and wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA)., 313388=Although the present specification describes components and functions implemented in the embodiments with reference to particular standards and protocols, the invention is not limited to such standards and protocols. Each of the standards for cellular networks (cdma2000, IS-95, W-CDMA) represent examples of the state of the art. Such standards are periodically superseded by faster or more efficient equivalents having essentially the same functions. Accordingly, replacement standards and protocols having the same functions are considered equivalents., 406068=In this section some of the known models for the time-varying wireless channel have been considered. The first pioneering work towards developing a model for a time-varying wireless channel was done by Belo in 1963. He showed that all aspects of a wideband channel can be captured in the time-varying impulse response function h(t, \u03c4), where the received signal y(t) can be written as:, 58655=Equation (1) does not assume that the spreading function is stationary. In other words, equation (1) does not assume that the chip sequence cj(n) is the same for every bit bj, which is the case in many DS-CDMA systems in which the orthogonal spreading codes, such as Hadamard and orthogonal variable spreading factor (OVSF) codes, are multiplied by long scrambling codes (i.e., PN sequences), such as IS-95, cdma2000 and W-CDMA. For example, the PN sequences for IS-95 and cdma2000 are ML shift register sequences and for W-CDMA are Gold codes. The dependence of the chip sequence cj(n) on the bit index i makes the spreading filter non-stationary. However, in practical CDMA systems, the spreading sequence repeats after a fixed interval, making the spreading filter cyclo-stationary, which needs to be incorporated in the receiver structure as well.}",
