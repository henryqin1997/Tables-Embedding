His always superb flatpicking, while as fast and fiery as ever, seems especially light, airy, and imbued with a somewhat more relaxed feel. That's not to say, however, that Grier leaves behind his characteristically unstoppable rhythmic drive. Many have suggested that Grier is the spiritual heir to the great Clarence White, and such comparisons are wholly justified on this record if just for Grier's supremely supportive and driving approach to playing rhythm guitar. Of course, David Grier's leads are what set jaws to dropping, and Lone Soldier is filled with mind-boggling technique. Like all Grier's recorded work, however, speedy fingers are only secondary to a pure musicality that would seem almost impossible to surpass if not for the existence of Grier's even more sublime 1997 album Panorama. Lone Soldier contains standout performances from the usual crew of young bluegrass and \"new acoustic\" music all-stars, plus appearances on several tracks by Flecktones electric bassist Victor Wooten, who turns in some of his most sensitive work on record., 120876=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
