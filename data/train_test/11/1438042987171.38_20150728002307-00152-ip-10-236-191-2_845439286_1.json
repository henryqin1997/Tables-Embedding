The company also increased its forecast for cash flows (from continuing operations) to the range of $425 million to $525 million, compared with the previous range of $400 million to $500 million. OCR continues to expect revenues between $6.1 billion and $6.2 billion., 22297=All seven estimates have been revised higher for 2012 in the last seven days, which has propelled the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.5% to $3.25. This represents an earnings growth of 52.7%., 21771=Bullish on 2012, 20945=On July 25, Omnicare reported second quarter 2012 adjusted earnings of 83 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 79 cents. Reported net income came in at $18.7 million, compared with a loss of $1.4 million in the year-ago quarter., 22752=Although shares plummeted around October 2011, they have since recovered to current levels. In addition to low P/B and P/S multiples, the stock is currently trading at a P/E multiple of 9.67. Going by the usual indicators of a P/E multiple below 15.0, a P/B ratio under 3.0 and a P/S ratio under 1.0 for a value stock, Omnicare appears to be undervalued., 62537=At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1986 it has nearly tripled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +26% per year. These returns cover a period from 1986-2011 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly, an independent accounting firm., 14820=by Zacks Equity Research \u00a0\u00a0Published on August 02, 2012 |, 62476=Copyright \u00a9 2015 Zacks Investment Research}",
