    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{63012=[0049] In this embodiment, the securing element is an adhesive bead. The adhesive bead is applied from an adhesive bead applicator 512 at any suitable rate. In one embodiment, the adhesive bead is applied at a rate of about five (5) to 100 gsm using elastic attachment adhesive. In a specific embodiment, the adhesive bead is applied at a rate of about 30 gsm. In one embodiment, the bead is positioned to within about 0.3 cm (0.13 in) of the edge of the web and contiguous with the edge of the back panel lamination adhesive as described herein. Leg elastics 516 are unwound from a feed roll 518 and then applied with a leg elastic oscillator 517 at a suitable rate and degree of elongation. In one embodiment, the leg elastics range from about 470 to 1540 decitex and are applied at an elongation of about 150 to 300%. At this point the outer layer 519 is unwound from an outer layer supply roll 520 and passed through feed rolls 522 and 524. The entire back panel is laminated together, including the portion of the elastics filaments contained within the laminate at a main tacker roll 526. Directly after the main tacker roll 526 a cutting means 528 cuts the portion of the leg elastics extending beyond the laminate to separate them, thus producing a laminated back panel 106. In one embodiment, a flex knife or pinch flex cutter is used. In another embodiment ultrasonics are used. In yet another embodiment a heat laser is used. After being cut, the elastics snap back to the adhesive bead edge and do not creep back into the product past this point., 48743=[0035] In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, the insert 108 is comprised of a fluid impervious backing sheet or outer cover 210, a fluid pervious facing sheet or liner 215, an absorbent core 212 and an intake/distribution layer 214. The outer cover 210 serves as a fluid barrier and can be made from any suitable liquid impermeable material or a material treated to be liquid impermeable. In one embodiment, the outer cover 210 is a laminate comprised of an inner liner layer and an outer film layer, such as a polyethylene film. In one embodiment, \u201cbreathable stretch thermal laminate\u201d (BSTL) is used for the outer cover 210. In an alternative embodiment the outer cover is an opaque sheet of material with an embossed or matte surface that is about one mil thick, although the invention is not so limited. In another alternative embodiment, the outer surface is made of extensible materials, such as necked, pleated (or micropleated) or creped nonwovens, including spunbond polypropylenes, bonded carded webs, or laminates of nonwovens and films that are necked, pleated or creped so as to allow the outer cover to extend with minimal force. For example, a suitable extensible material is a 60% necked, polypropylene spunbound having a basis weight of about 1.2 osy. For a further description of extensible materials, see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09,855,182, filed on May 14, 2001, entitled, \u201cAbsorbent Garment with Expandable Absorbent Element,\u201d commonly assigned, and hereby incorporated herein by reference. The outer cover can also be made of nonwovens, films, or composites of films and nonwovens., 50955=[0037] The absorbent core or absorbent batt 212 located between the outer cover and liner serves to absorb liquids, as is known in the art and can be made from any suitable material. The absorbent batt can be can be any material that tends to swell or expand as it absorbs exudates, including various liquids and/or fluids excreted or exuded by the user. For example, the absorbent material can be made of airformed, airlaid and/or wetlaid composites of fibers and high absorbency materials, referred to as superabsorbents. Superabsorbents typically are made of polyacrylic acids, such as DOW 2035 available from DOW Chemical of Midland, Mich. The fibers can be fluff pulp materials, such as Alliance CR-1654, or any combination of crosslinked pulps, hardwood, softwood, and synthetic fibers. Airlaid and wetlaid structures typically include binding agents, which are used to stabilize the structure. Other absorbent materials, alone or in combination, and including webs of carded or air-laid textile fibers, multiple plys of creped cellulose wadding, various super absorbent materials, various foams, such as synthetic foam sheets, absorbent films, and the like may also be used. The batt may also be slightly compressed or embossed in selected areas as desired. Various acceptable absorbent materials are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,147,343, entitled, \u201cAbsorbent Products Containing Hydrogels With Ability To Swell Against Pressure,\u201d U.S. Pat. No. 5,601,542, entitled \u201cAbsorbent Composite,\u201d and U.S. Pat. No. 5,651,862, entitled, \u201cWet Formed Absorbent Composite,\u201d all of which are commonly assigned and hereby incorporated herein by reference. Furthermore, the properties of high-absorbency particles can range from about zero (0) to about 100%, and the proportion of fibrous material from about zero (0) to about 100%.}",

This application is intended to cover any adaptations or variations of the present invention. Therefore, it is manifestly intended that this invention be limited only by the claims and the equivalents thereof. [0055] All publications, patents, and patent documents cited in the specification are incorporated by reference herein, as though individually incorporated by reference. In the case of any inconsistencies, the present disclosure, including any definitions therein, will prevail. [0054] The present invention provides significant advantages over other disposable garments and methods for manufacture thereof. Unlike prior art products, since the product itself is not cut at the time the elastics are cut, consumers do not perceive that there is damage to the product. Furthermore, since there is essentially continuous active elastic around the leg openings, a good fit and gasketing of the garment are maintained, which thereby improves leakage protection of the garment and the resulting dignity and comfort of the user. [0053] Use of the securing element as described herein near the edge of the product serves to control elastic placement and control snapback. Unlike conventional products, the elastics in this",
