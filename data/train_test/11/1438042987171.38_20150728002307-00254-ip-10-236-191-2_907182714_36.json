            "Every student on campus feels extremely secure as CLU has an awesome campus security department who are all well trained, caring individuals.",
            "I don't know much about the Greek Life on campus. Sorry.",
            "CLU clubs and activities are bountiful, and there is a club for almost every single student's hobbies and interests.",
            "CLU is great for the SERIOUS students who want to be able to put CLU on their resume' as a well known school that has a high graduation rate and high rate of placement into successful jobs upon graduation.",
            "It's awesome to climb the mountain in from of Cal Lutheran University in order to participate in the painting of the rocks on the mountain. New freshman do this every year.",
            "CLU tuition is what one would expect at a private university. However, I will again mention that the Professor to student ratio is low (about 17 to 1) and the curriculum is solid in order to prepare us for our future.",
            "There are MANY things to do on campus. There are literally dozens of clubs one can join, shopping is within walking distance, and all amenities are accessible.",
            "The food in the campus dining hall is made to order and pretty tasty.",
            "Dorm life at CLU is great! It is quiet when it needs to be, and fun when there's time for fun. Students are friendly and respect one another.",
            "Academics at CLU are rigorous, but manageable. You don't want to attend a college where academics are not rigorous because then you won't have a solid foundation for your future career goals.",
            "If you're thinking about attending CLU, definitely take a campus tour during recruitment week. Once you visit, you won't want to leave. This visit will help you decide this is exactly where you want to be.",
            "Cal Lutheran University is a terrific college with a low student to professor ratio, which is one of major reasons why I chose to attend CLU. My brother also graduated from CLU, which gave him a very strong foundation that allowed him to complete a Masters degree and led him into his current PhD program. I know that attending CLU will lead me in the same direction, which is why I love CLU!"

Professors here really care about your education and will get to know you on a personal level if you are willing. I have some of my professors numbers that are in my major and allow me to contact them if need be. The size of the classes are small with a ratio of about 17:1 (17 students to 1 professor)., 89404=there are many traditions that are unusual here, but one i think is the greatest is the undie run. mid to late october, everyone strips to their undies, gives the clothes they had on to charity, and then goes on a run around campus. it's all about the charity! there's a lot of cool locations that are around the campus, you just have to find them!, 172126=As of right now, our cafeteria is very sub-par. However, we do have a cafe called the Centrum, which is very convenient because you can get all kinds of food to go. We are in the process of building a new dining commons which is going to be VERY nice! It will be finished in 2015., 51305=Set in sunny Southern California where it is close to Malibu Beach, Six Flags, and Disneyland, as well as Downtown Hollywood. The student:professor ratio is generally 20:1 so the professors can offer one on one help and get to know the students' personalities and learning styles. Has extremely competitive Chemistry, Biology, and Communications programs with opportunities for internships at local hospitals and media companies in Hollywood., 162552=The food and dining is okay right now, however, in 2014 a new dinning commons is coming and it will all be updates and better., 52417=There is a cafe called the Centrum that does breakfast specialties, and provides salads, sandwiches, pizzas, and hamburgers for lunch and dinner. As of September 2014, there will be a brand new Cafeteria on campus with all kinds of food, and a coffee shop., 220302=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 126389=The dining options the school has now aren't horrible, but it does get redundant throughout the year. Cal Lu offers a traditional dining hall, Centrum (cafe style), Jamba Juice, Mogen Market (open 5pm-12am), and a small kiosk. Cal Lu is currently starting to rebuild a new two floor dining hall that is scheduled to be finished after summer 2014., 18155=California Lutheran can be expensive, but they are willing to help you. With numerous donors and out side sources I believe its over 85% of students that get some sort of financial aid. CLU already provides $19 million a year in financial aid to students, but in 2009-2010 it plans to increase the amount of scholarship money available to current students to help them meet educational expenses during the recession. source: http://www.callutheran.edu/news/news_detail.php?story_id=5453}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Ideal for students that enjoy small classes, close relationships with their professors and don't want to be solely a number! Perfect for the all around students, there are many clubs and activities to get involved in! Tips for prospective students Don't let the cost of the school make you shy away! The school is amazing! Bang for the buck Although it is pricey, it is worth it! Would not transfer for any cost! Am enjoying being here The campus is welcoming and safe. The school also puts on an event every Friday, called Club Lu, that is free to the students (includes a chuckee cheese night, black out socials, snowball fights, etc.). Am learning a lot The professors work with the students and are more than happy to to find time outside of their office hours to help.
