It is all you can eat buffet, however, severely over or under cooked food, particularly chicken, is a daily occurrence. Food in the University Center is very good, however, it is expensive. Drumlin Hall and P-Street Cafe have similar food which is OK but selection is either a burger or sub, everyday. Drumlin Hall is closed for the 2012-2013 school year. Only eat at Esker Hall on their occasional steak and shrimp nights as it is cooked right., 208029=UW-Whitewater is in the process of re-opening one of the main dining halls; the tenative date of opening is February 28th. The quality of the other dining halls on campus is good. We have a lot of options that range from pasta to pizza! We have a couple well known restaurants on campus such as Unos and Erberts & Gerberts. We also have a few sandwich shops and a buffet as well., 312411=Dorm food is nice because it's easy to not have to try to figure out dinner on your own, but it can be a little gross sometimes. Drumlin was just renovated in 2013, so it's pretty nice and tastes okay from what I've had. Esker is low-quality food, but you get a lot of it. Erbs and Gerbs is always busy and frequently runs out of ingredients. P-Street is pretty good depending on what you get. The UC has a lot of good food but doesn't cover it in the meal plans for the most part.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Whitewater has a great environment for learning. Class sizes can range from a small number of students to a lecture hall but you are usually able to find classes where you can choose whether or not you want a small or large class size. Most professors know their subjects really well. Occasionally you will come across some who teach a class that is not their specialty and then it is hard to learn because they don\u2019t know what they are talking about. But in general, the professors at Whitewater are very competent and try to be as helpful as they can if a student does not understand something.
