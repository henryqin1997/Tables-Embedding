There are lots of scholarships and grant opportunities available for students who attend or plan on attending AAMU. You just have to meet and talk to the right people. For example, any students who plan on having a career in the medical field can join this organization called HCOP and receive free MCAT,PCAT, and DCAT exams tutoring as well as a $2000 scholarship for the fall., 245767=There is the Block where all of the Greek stones are. There is the founding president and his wife's grave located on the campus. There is also the Magic City Classic, which is held in Birmingham, Alabama the fourth weekend in October against the rival school, Alabama State University. This is the biggest HBCU game of the season., 267558=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot I would honestly say that I am learning a lot of new things at AAMU. I came here thinking that college was going to be extremely hard and that I would fail. But in reality I have had the best classes and very helpful teachers. This is my second semester here and I am very excited about my new classes.

If you are looking for an exciting college experience where you meet many people this school is not for you. If your going to college for the sole purpose of learning and improving yourself AAMU is for you. This is a historically black university so expect not to have the best of everything given to you. Its up to you",
