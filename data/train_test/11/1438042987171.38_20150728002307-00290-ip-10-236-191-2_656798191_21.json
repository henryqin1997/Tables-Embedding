            "First, it must have a decent inventory of downloadable videos. I find that out in the TBP review. Then, the cost per day, no DRM, well developed preview on the site and quality of video samplers in the preview. If the review of a site (The Best Porn) is not high, I'll pass. If it's not mentioned at all in TBP, I'll check other site reviewers, but I can only remember signing up for one site not on TBP...and it was a total POS (piece of shit).",
