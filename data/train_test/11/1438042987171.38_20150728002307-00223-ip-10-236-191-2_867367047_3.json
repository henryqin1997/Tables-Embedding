If an app has been localized and localized resources have been deployed in satellite assemblies, it looks up culture-specific resources, provides resource fallback when a localized resource does not exist, and supports resource serialization. For more information about creating and managing resources in desktop apps and Windows Store apps, see the following sections: Desktop Apps Creating Resources Instantiating a ResourceManager Object ResourceManager and Culture-Specific Resources Retrieving Resources Handling MissingManifestResourceException and MissingSatelliteAssemblyException Exceptions Resource Versioning <satelliteassemblies> Configuration File Node Windows Store Apps Desktop Apps For desktop apps, the ResourceManager class retrieves resources from binary resource (.resources) files. Typically, a language compiler or the Assembly Linker (AL.exe) embeds these resource files in an assembly. You can also use a ResourceManager object to retrieve resources directly from a .resources file that is not embedded in an assembly, by using the CreateFileBasedResourceManager method. Caution Using standalone .resources files in an ASP.NET app will break XCOPY deployment, because the resources remain locked until",
