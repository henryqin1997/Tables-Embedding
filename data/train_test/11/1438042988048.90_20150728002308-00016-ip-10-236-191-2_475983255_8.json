    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{12681=The problem with the Harakas invention is that the steel reinforcing wire must first be cleaned then coated with an amino silane and then coated with a resin latex before it is incorporated into the rubber. Along the same lines, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,236,564 Kalafus et al. 1980, which teaches that a phenolformaldehyde coating on the bright steel cord provides protection of the bond from heat and humidity degradation. U.S. Pat. No. 3,088,847 (Pines 1963) broadly discloses treating metal surfaces with specific amino functional organo silanes to improve initial adhesion., 11639=The problem of corrosion of bright steel wire and the consequent loss of adhesion between steel wire and rubber in steel wire reinforced tires is well-known. A considerable amount of effort has been devoted towards the understanding of the mechanism(s) of corrosion and adhesion loss. Based on the results of the above studies, some progress has been made in solving this problem using the approach of modifying the rubber stocks and/or brass plating. One approach to the solution to the corrosion problem of steel reinforcement in tires is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,052,524 Harakas 1977. Harakas found that if one first cleaned the steel reinforcing wire with acid or base, followed by a water rinse, coated the reinforcing wire with amino alkyl silane, then resorcinol formaldehyde latex (RFL) and then embedded the coated wire in rubber, the hydrolytic stability of the composite was improved. The adhesion recited in the Harakas patent, however, may well have been due to the resorcinol formaldehyde resin employed., 11434=This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 260,234 filed May 4, 1981, now abandoned.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes Dip pickup of the silane onto the cords was very small indicating a molecular thickness of the silane on the cord was sufficient. The amount of dip pickup is small but effective. It has been demonstrated that the bright steel cords treated with the various aminosilane coupling agents adhere very well to the rubber compounds containing Cohedur RL and Hi-Sil. The unaged adhesions of the aminosilane treated wire were found to be equivalent to that of the Bekaert brass-plated wire and somewhat lower than that of the National Standard brass-plated wire. The humid aged adhesions for the silane treated wires were, however, found to be considerably better than that of the brass-plated wires. The data show that the compound containing both Hi-Sil and Cohedur RL gave the highest adhesions. The compound containing Cohedur RL only also gave adequate adhesions. However, the adhesions for the compound containing only Hi-Sil as the bonding agent were essentially the same as those for the compound containing no bonding agents. There is thus an indication that perhaps the interactions between Cohedur RL in the rubber compound and the aminosilanes on the wire are responsible for the bonding of aminosilane treated wires to rubber. The differences in the adhesion values for the compounds containing Cohedur RL+Hi-Sil and that containing only Cohedur RL may, at least partly, be due to differences in the curing characteristics and/or the properties (e.g. tear strength) of",
