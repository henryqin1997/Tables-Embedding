With this arrangement, it will be evident that accidental release of the post 92 is effectively prevented. It will also be apparent that the camming action of the locking device 100 may take a number of forms in addition to the one illustrated. For example, the locking function may be achieved by moving the camming surface axially away from the bracket 12 where the slope of member 70 is opposite to that shown. Another alternative may involve requiring relative movement between two annular members to position or change the position of the camming surface. Further, for increased resistance to accidental release, one can make the spring constant of spring 160 larger than conventional for surgical clamps. to allow the balls to be pushed back from their projecting position by the force applied by the movement of the post 92. FIG. 5 , the lower portion of the surface 172 projects radially inwardly a greater extent than the upper sloping portion. With this arrangement, with the body 162 moved by the coil spring 160 away from the bracket 90 when the post 92 is inserted as shown, the balls are permitted to move away from the post 92. However, with the post 92 inserted and",
