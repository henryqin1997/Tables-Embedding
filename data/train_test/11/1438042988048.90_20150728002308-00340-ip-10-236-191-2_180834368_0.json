Ward went back to the drawing board a second time., 35802=In 2002, the couple launched Global Crafts as a 650-square-foot retail store in New Smyrna Beach, Fla. The sleepy beach town had few buyers interested in gifts and crafts from overseas., 36295=In 2003, Global Crafts shuttered its retail store and started selling wholesale on the Web, targeting the 100 stores in the U.S. that specialized in handmade overseas items. Ward and Jones invested $40,000, opened a 1,100 square-foot-warehouse, and gained Fair Trade Federation accreditation, boosting their credibility with retailers. Following Fair Trade's principles, Global Crafts pays craftspeople 50% upfront and 50% when the item is shipped., 97529=Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

By keeping its wholesale prices low -- $8 to $12 for wire bangles, bracelets, and napkin rings -- the company grew sales to $200,000 in 2004., 37272=Revenue rose 40% a year from 2005 to 2007, as Ward and Jones learned how to boost sales by customizing products and offer incentives. Despite its growing business, Global Crafts continued with a very lean staff of just four people besides the founders: a brand manager plus one employee to process orders and two workers to fulfill them., 38271=In 2009 -- with the economic downturn peaking -- Global Crafts had its best year ever and crossed the seven-figure mark. Its annual sales were $1.3 million, with 65% of the revenue coming from the wholesale and the rest from the new retail brand. This year, Global Crafts is on track for sales of $2 million.}",
