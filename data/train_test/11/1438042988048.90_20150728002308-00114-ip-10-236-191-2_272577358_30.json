            "Analysis",
            "Alabama has officially punched their ticket to Atlanta and the SEC Title game; and all but clinched a trip to the Natty \u2013 after a 38-17 win over LSU. Only two tests remain for the Tide: Auburn in the Iron Bowl, and their SEC Title game foe. But, with the way this team is playing, plan on seeing them in LA come January.",
            "Florida State continues to click on all cylinders, after another dominating 59-3 win over Wake Forrest. The Noles\u2019 only roadblocks remain Florida and the ACC Title game (if you want to call those roadblocks\u2026) As long as they don\u2019t go \u2018Clemsoning\u2019 it appears FSU is set for an appearance in the Natty.",
            "Lingering in the wings, is Ohio State. The Buckeyes needed chips to fall in their direction, and an Oregon loss was the first chip. Now \u2013 it\u2019ll take a Florida State or Alabama loss if OSU wants a shot at the Natty \u2013 if not, they\u2019ll be the first team since TCU in 2010 to go unbeaten and not appear in the Title.",
            "Baylor called their Thursday night game the biggest in program history, and they played like it. After the dust settled, the final was 41-12 over Oklahoma. I wasn\u2019t on the banwagon before they romped the Sooners, and I\u2019m not sure if I can jump on board yet. Their final four games will all be tests: Vs Texas Tech, at Oklahoma State, at TCU and Vs Texas. Make it through those? I\u2019m a believer.",
            "Well, didn\u2019t see that coming. Stanford DOMINATED Oregon from start to (almost) finish, and the 26-20 final wasn\u2019t an indicator on how this game went. The tests don\u2019t stop with Oregon, though, as Stanford has to travel to LA to officially punch their ticket to the Pac-12 game \u2013 against a USC team that\u2019s playing it's best football of the season.",
            "Overrated? No. Overhyped? Maybe. Oregon was embarrassed by Stanford, and now has to swallow the fact that the Cardinal kept them out of the Title game for the 2nd straight year. Not all is lost though; if Oregon wins out they\u2019ll make it to a 5th straight BCS game. While there\u2019s still the potential of making the Pac-12 Title game (with a Stanford loss).",
            "Clemson had the week off, which hurt because they dropped in all three polls (Dirty, BCS & AP). The Tigers will get a shot at national redemption, and potentially to make a BCS game \u2013 when they close the season against South Carolina.",
            "Who didn\u2019t see this coming? Auburn is now 9-1, after a 55-23 win over Tennessee at Rocky Top. Their lone blemish remains LSU earlier this season; but the last two games won\u2019t be easy \u2013 against Georgia and Alabama (though both games are at home).",
            "Jonny Manziel is making a serious case for a 2nd straight Heisman trophy \u2013 but he can\u2019t afford another loss, in my opinion. A&M beat Mississippi State 51-41 in College Station Saturday. The last two will provide a chance for Manziel to put his name in the history books \u2013 at LSU, at Missouri.",
            "Oklahoma State continues to build an impressive resume, after a 42-6 win over Kansas State on Saturday. How\u2019s this for a finish, though? At Texas, Vs Baylor and Vs Oklahoma. Good luck.",
            "Missouri remains the front runner in the SEC East, but can\u2019t afford another loss. That won\u2019t be easy, with Ole Miss and Texas A&M remaining on the schedule.",
            "South Carolina had the weekend off, still remaining a game behind Missouri in the SEC East. Florida, Coastal Carolina and Clemson loom on the schedule for the Gamecocks.",
            "Michigan State had the weekend off as well, in preparation for Nebraska this coming Saturday in Lincoln. The winner \u2013 will face Ohio State in the Big 10 Title game.",
            "Central Florida struggled, but eventually beat Houston 19-14 Saturday. You may think they\u2019re ranked too high, but the only loss on their resume is a close one to South Carolina.",
            "Poor LSU. Alabama remains their nemesis, after a 38-17 loss in Tuscaloosa. They\u2019ll get a shot at redemption, though, with Texas A&M coming to Baton Rouge in two weeks.",
            "Louisville won in a very unimpressive fashion over winless Uconn, 31-10. Teddy Brdigewater\u2019s Heisman hopes are all but done, though he is still expected to be a top-3 pick in the NFL Draft. Louisville remains a game behind UCF in the AAC Conference, with a automatic bid to the BCS on the line.",
            "Big game whoops lived up to his name once again Thursday night at Baylor, falling to the Bears 41-12. Oklahoma is officially out of the running in the Big 12, as they sit two games behind Texas (yes, Texas leads the Big 12).",
            "Myles Jack. Oh my. The Freshman linebacker for UCLA had 8 tackles, and was the Pac-12 Offensive Player of The Week. UCLA had a great win, at Arizona Saturday night, to keep their hopes alive to win the Pac-12 South.",
            "Wisconsin took a break from Big 10 play, beating BYU Saturday in Madison. Indiana, Penn State and Minnesota remain on the schedule.",
            "The Sun Devils needed a late rally to survive Utah, pulling out a 20-19 win. ASU remains atop the Pac-12 South, with a key game against Oregon State in Tempe this coming weekend.",
            "A week after pulling a Hail Mary win out of their you know where\u2026 Nebraska got back to their defensive roots, beating Michigan 17-13 at the Big House. Amazingly, the Huskers still have a shot at the Big 10 Title game, but have to beat Michigan State this Saturday in Lincoln.",
            "The Texas Longhorns are in 1st place in the Big 12. Take a second to let that sink in. After a 47-40 overtime win at West Virginia, Texas is now 6-0 in conference play. But \u2013 the meat of the schedule remains: Vs Oklahoma State, Texas Tech and at Baylor.",
            "Miami owed all of us two losses, after sneaking past North Carolina and Wake Forrest \u2013 and we now have those two losses. After losing to Florida State, the Canes backed it up with a loss to Virginia Tech. Miami now sits behind Duke, Virginia Tech and Georgia Tech in the ACC Coastal.",
            "Northern Illinois had the weekend off, still sitting at 9-0 and hoping for a 2nd straight BCS game.",
            "Fresno State started slow, but eventually beat Wyoming on the road Saturday night."
