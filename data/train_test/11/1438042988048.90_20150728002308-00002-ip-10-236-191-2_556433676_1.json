            "Jun. 07, 2012 1.) Start with 4 slingshots 2.) Put One in each corner (So you get as much of the map as you can) 3.) Make them not move. 4.) Buy a sniper and place him in the middle 5.) Upgrade All except the speed (Try getting them all to lvl 3 before buying a lvl 4 for any) 6.)Buy 4 more sling shots and let them roam 7) Buy any friends you want. Works for Easy / medium + for a easy walkthrough! Thanks! \u200b",
