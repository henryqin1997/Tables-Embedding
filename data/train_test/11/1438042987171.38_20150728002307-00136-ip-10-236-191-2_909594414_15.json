The visitation rules are that all visitors must be signed out by 12:30 am. I feel like i have more freedom at my own home than at the college. Also, the girls are full of drama.}",

Greek Life None! I wish there was Clubs and Activities It's a lot. you have to join as much as possible if you can manage it all.
