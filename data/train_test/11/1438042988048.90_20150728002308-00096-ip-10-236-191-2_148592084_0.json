Inexplicably, he started the match with the Dally M hooker-of-the-year in Brad Drew on the bench, when he should have punted Jason Taylor from the squad altogether, switched PJ Marsh from hooker to half and play Drew in the position where had \"brained\" them all year., 14605=Central to the criticism by Buderus was what he perceived as unfair treatment by the club towards Kurt Reynoldson. The bearded backrower needs to play 15 first grade games (he's played 14) to trigger a clause in his contract that gives him the option of signing a lucrative deal for season 2008. Buderus felt Reynoldson was purposely being prevented from reaching his target to save the club money and force the player out.}",
