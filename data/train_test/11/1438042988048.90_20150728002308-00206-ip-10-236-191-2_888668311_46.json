            "We only have one frat and one sorority, but they're both super awesome.",
            "There's a lot of stuff on campus that you can do for fun, we usually have a ton of opportunities for students to hang out or do cool stuff, otherwise, we have really quick access to Rosedale Mall, the University of Minnesota, or Downtown Minneapolis. It's also possible to get to the Mall of America pretty easily as well.",
            "I don't have a meal plan either, as a commuting student, so for me, the food is really overpriced. From what I've heard, the food is okay, but it's not super fantastic. We have a Subway in the Klas Center, and we have a Starbucks in Anderson, as well as the Corner Store, but some of that stuff can get pretty expensive pretty fast. The places to eat around the campus are awesome though. Black Sea, a Turkish restaurant has fantastic food, I go there a lot. You can also order from Jimmy John's or Toppers (a pizza place). Otherwise, you can go down to University Ave and take the Green Line to either of the banks on the U of M and eat there, or take the 84 bus down to Rosedale and eat there.",
            "I'm not really applicable to rate the dorm life, considering I'm a commuter student. However, from what I've seen, I like most of the dorms, save for Sorin. The only downside is that there's no air conditioning for the summer/hotter months, so you'll have to bring a fan. The dorms, especially doubles, can be kind of tiny, so you have to be careful with how much stuff you bring in. They have communal kitchens, which is fine, the only thing that I personally didn't like besides the lack of space is the communal bathrooms.",
            "As a double major, things can get pretty rough. I started off pretty early working on my majors, which made things a little easier. Some of the classes can be really difficult, and I'd recommend checking ratemyprofessor to see what other students say about professors before you take classes from them. Take everything you read with a grain of salt though, I personally use it just to see how difficult other students think they are. I really like a lot of the courses offered, but sometimes it feels like professors have forgotten that we have other coursework to complete, and that we only have a couple of days in between classes to complete all of the work that they assign us, provided it's not an extended assignment, but honestly that's something that happens everywhere. Just make sure you mange your time well.",
            "It's okay if you don't know what you want to do right off the bat, try filling up some Hamline Plan letters to find something you're more passionate about. In terms of First Year Seminars, pick something that will interest you, don't worry too much about whether or not it's writing intensive. Pick based on your interests. If you have college credit from AP, IB, PSEO or CIS, transfer it in as soon as you can, and make sure, before you come here, that it will all go through. The higher the standing you have, the sooner you can register (which is super, super helpful). Alongside registering, take a J-term, you're already paying for it and some of the topics are absolutely fascinating. Finally, even if you're a commuter like I am, get yourself involved in the community. Don't be afraid to join a club or anything because you're worried you won't have enough time. You need to take time for yourself and do what you like to do for fun, don't just focus all of your energy on academics all of the time.",
            "It's a really great school that offers students plenty of opportunities to succeed and explore what they're passionate about. At first, I thought it was going to be a lot like my old high school, very apathetic towards things in terms of the greater community, but I quickly learned that everyone is very invested in one way or another. It might be a small school, but that gives it an even better edge, it allows us to get better hands-on learning, but we're still immersed in plenty of different cultures and have a lot of opportunities available."

It's one of the homecoming events and it's great because some people do it just for fun, while others are very competitive - and all the acts are cheered for. The tree lighting ceremony in December is really awesome, too., 133193=I stayed overnight in Sorin Hall in February, and I really enjoyed it.
