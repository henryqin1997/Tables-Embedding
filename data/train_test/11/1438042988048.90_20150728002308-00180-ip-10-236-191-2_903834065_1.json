They were something more, though -- making way for a newer type of genre in the '90s -- grunge rock. It could be said that because of Firefall, bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Stone Temple Pilots became famous. And for sure, the genre of rock 'n' roll couldn't be happier. Firefall Tickets - The Accolades of FirefallLeading right into the '80s, this iconic band had cut eight albums, the first two hitting gold certification and the third reaching platinum status. In their career, eleven singles had hit the charts -- a few of them being 'Livin' Ain't Livin',' 'You Are the Woman,' and 'Cinderella.' Definitely a hall-of-famer? You bet.
