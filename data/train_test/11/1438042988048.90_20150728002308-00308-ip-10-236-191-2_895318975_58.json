It isn't particularly difficult to get in to the school as long as you complete the application correctly and have fulfilled all of the applicant requirements. It's also a very affordable university, about $2000 per semester for in-state, $8000 for out of state, and there are plenty of Honors programs and scholarships to be had!, 132368=The campus is in Harlem, which isn't that great of a neighborhood. I'm usually always on campus, and I've never had a problem with safety. My walk from the train station to the campus is about 5 minutes long. I've never felt threatened along the way and my latest class ends at 7:45 PM. I actually walk past an elementary school so there usually isn't any funny business going on. For late hours, however, I know that there is a public safety number to call. Apparently a patrol officer will escort you to the train station, or wherever you need to be that is within a reasonable proximity to the campus. The number is located on our ID cards., 347745=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 73695=From the beginning of Fall 2011 semester till now, I have learned about many aspects about my major. Advisers and professors always aid in choosing the right classes for my major. And my fellow classmates and friends from previous years have also guided me on the campus about the questions I may have., 281212=People come to CCNY (and CUNYS in general) because of it's low tuition cost. CCNY is about $2500-$3000 a semester (about $5000 a year) and it is ranked as one of Princeton Review's and US news best colleges. CCNY is a good school, for very cheap.}",

Students interested in conducting research will be able to choose from many labs in the fields of science, engineering, and psychology. Tips for prospective students Before registering for your courses, cross check the professors with ratemyprofessors.com! You'll have a much better idea of what to expect; as I said before, not everyone is a winner. In addition, if you are planning to have two classes in a row, try to ensure that they're in the same building. The campus doesn't look big",
