For this phosphor, one pellet was formed from Al2S3 and the other pellet was formed from the required mixture of barium sulphide and europium sulphide. The thickness of the BaAl2S4:Eu phosphor film was 2700 Angstroms, measured using scanning electron microscopy., 53700=As a comparison, it was reported in JP 8-134440 of the Mitsui Mining & Smelting Ltd and Sharp Corporation, published May 28, 1996, that electroluminescent luminosity for sputtered thin films of CaAl2S:Eu phosphor was 1 cd/m2 at a 1 kHz excitation frequency with CIE coordinates of x=0.13, y=0.377. With the method of the present invention, the same phosphor material provided much higher luminosity and improved colour saturation, the luminosity being approximately two orders of magnitude higher., 52641=The thickness of the CaAl2S4:Eu phosphor film was 2300 Angstroms, as measured using scanning electron microscopy. Examples of structures incorporating the phosphor films are shown in cross section and in plan view in FIGS. 3 and 4. The deposited phosphors were annealed following deposition at a temperature of about 700\ufffd C. for 2 minutes under nitrogen. To complete the test device, a second thin film of alumina was deposited on top of the phosphor layer, and a second electrode structure comprising indium tin oxide was deposited on top of the alumina layer.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The similar results for the electroluminescent colour coordinates of the deposited films to those of the photoluminescence of pressed powders provide good evidence that the composition of the thin films was close to that for the corresponding powders and therefore that the dual source deposition method facilitates good control over the stoichiometry of the deposited films. For the composition corresponding to a=1, i.e. BaAl2S4:Eu, the luminance was about 40 cd/m2 at 70 volts above the threshold voltage of 190 volts. The CIE colour coordinates were x=0.15 and y=0.14, which are again similar to the photoluminescence values observed for the pellets having the same nominal composition. As reported in Example I, for the composition corresponding to a=0, i.e. CaAl2S4:Eu, and using an excitation frequency of 120 Hz and a pulse width of 30\u03bc seconds, the electroluminescent pixel had a brightness of 90 cd/m2 at 70 volts above the threshold voltage of 180 volts while its CIE colour coordinates were x=0.19 and y=0.62. This is reasonably similar to the photoluminescence values observed for the pellets having the same nominal composition. A phosphor film was prepared using the material described in Example 1 with a=1. The procedure used was the same as that described in Example I. For this phosphor, one pellet was formed from Al2S3 and the other pellet was formed from the required mixture of barium sulphide and europium sulphide. The thickness of the BaAl2S4:Eu phosphor film",
