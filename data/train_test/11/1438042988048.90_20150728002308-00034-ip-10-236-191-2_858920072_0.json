Electronic Health Records (EHR), data warehouses, and registries are critical components to quality improvement efforts. If used properly to maximize their functionality, it\u2019s possible to generate quality measures that provide timely, understandable, comprehensive, clinically valid, and meaningful feedback to safety net providers and their practice teams. This information is critical for informing a quality improvement strategy and especially important when participating in a Patient-Centered Medical Home or Accountable Care Organization. Presenters include a quality improvement specialist from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement who will focus broadly on quality improvement. The other two presenters, HRSA grantees from rural and health center settings, will provide useful tips on obtaining data from EHRs, as well as using this information to drive quality improvement and implement practice changes.}",
