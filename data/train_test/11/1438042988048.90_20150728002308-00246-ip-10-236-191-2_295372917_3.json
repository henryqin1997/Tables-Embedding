Do I just mark them as duplicated pages and continue on as there seems nothing else can be done. Will this problem have been corrected elsewhere so those pages will eventually show up in full so that they can be entered? Assuming this is supposed to be in the Q and A section - you should only mark it as a duplicate image if it is actually the same image that you have seen elsewhere in the same image set, so if it is a duplicate page but the image is different, e.g. another page also appears in the image, you should key the names even though you may have keyed them before. --Katerimmer 22:21, 6 August 2013 (UTC), 70651=Q: I have a series of images that contain no names, but do contain agricultural data (crop acreage, livestock, etc.) on numbered lines that probably line up with names on other pages. Do I call this a \"Cover page, Section header, etc.\"? It doesn't seem to fit any other type of form.--Collier Smith 21:47, 8 July 2013 (UTC), 60926=Q: I am working on the Kansas, City and County Census and some of the pages just have Population March 1, 1953 at the top and then each name is listed with different cities. Using the census form there is the place to put township, etc for the header and then it just asks for names but there isn't a place to put the different cities or ages. How should I key this in?, 63635=Q: I have a page in with the 1953 census that has St. John's Hospital at the top and then a list of \"Sisters\" (nuns). Would i key in the name of the hospital in the Name Given or just key the sisters' names?, 62013=Q: Some of the images I have seen are definitely Census Pages; however, the only information is the date (i.e. March 1, 1956) with no names listed. Should these be keyed as a census page (and accepted with no data) or\u00a0keyed as a blank page?\u00a0, 69298=Q: I have a census page where the assessor put two names on several of the records. I assume it is husband and wife names because it shows as number of persons in the family as 2 for these records only. One example is Anderson, Joseph (Mary). Should I show them as separate records? Yes, you would key one record for Joseph and one for Mary in this case. --Katerimmer 22:30, 6 August 2013 (UTC), 61629=Q: When keying for the Agriculture census for 1944, the Ag. Census has data for the previous year (1943). Do i key the year as 1943 or 1944?, 71525=A: It appears that \"Pete\" is probably an alias. Since there is no field in this project data for alias, it should be ingnored (unfortunately). Also answered on message board. --Rhmaynard 14:59, 9 August 2013 (UTC)}",

Last = Reser(Pete) First = M. P. Should it be \"M P Pete Reser\"? Katerimmer 22:30, 6 August 2013 (UTC) A: Yes, this is a cover page. -- Q: I have a series of images that contain no names, but do contain agricultural data (crop acreage, livestock, etc.) on numbered lines that probably line up with names on other pages.
