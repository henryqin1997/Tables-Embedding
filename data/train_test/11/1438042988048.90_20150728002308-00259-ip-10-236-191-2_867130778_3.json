The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of increasing nasal PYY3-36 dosing on weight loss post 24 weeks of treatment. Secondary Objectives: To evaluate the safety of three nasal PYY3 36 dose groups compared to nasal placebo To compare the weight loss post 12 and 24 weeks of treatment for each of the three nasal PYY3 36 dose groups versus the nasal placebo group To compare the proportion of patients who lose at least 5% and 10% of the baseline body weight post 12 and 24 weeks of therapy for each of the three nasal PYY3 36 dose groups versus the nasal placebo group To compare the weight loss and proportion of patients who lose at least 5% of the baseline body weight post 12 and 24 weeks of treatment with sibutramine versus capsule placebo To compare the weight loss and proportion of patients who lose at least 5% of the baseline body weight post 12 and 24 weeks of treatment with nasal placebo versus capsule placebo To compare the weight loss and proportion of patients who lose at least 5% of the baseline body weight post 12 and 24 weeks of treatment with sibutramine versus the nasal PYY3 36 dose groups",
