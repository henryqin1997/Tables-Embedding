            "There are these blue safety poles everywhere on campus in case you're walking alone, where you can call campus police. They give you campus polices' telephone number in every dorm in case of an emergency.",
            "Greek life is very alive at Winthrop University! You'll see them every week around common time. They have fundraisers and fun events around campus, especially during the Fall. And don't forget the cool parties they throw!",
            "There are so many clubs and activities to join it's ridiculous! Anything you could possibly think of, there's a club for it. Which is a great thing because students can get involved around campus doing something they enjoy.",
            "For fun, you can attend greek life parties, go to city in Charlotte, which is only 30 minutes away, and shop, party, go to concerts, anything! You can also join any of the cool clubs that Winthrop University has.",
            "The Thomson cafe is okay. There are certain days where they will have great food and certain days where its barely anything in there you'll like. The Diggs Center is pretty cool too, the food is awesome but very pricey. However, I wish they had more variety.",
            "The dorm rooms are pretty old and need to be updated. You would think as much as tuition is there, they would be a little nicer. However, with all the fun you will have, the quality of the dorm rooms will no longer be a problem to you.",
            "With the professors, small class sizes, and a wide variety of tutoring opportunities, your academic goals can be reached in no time! The Professors are really nice and take education seriously.",
            "Get to know the people around you. Be open to new students that you may have never thought you would ever speak to. You will be amazed at the lasting friendships you will make.",
            "If you are looking for a diverse University, then Winthop University is for you! The campus is filled with friendly and helpful people everywhere. Winthrop University is the best place to receive a well-rounded degree."

The faculty are also top notch and that transcends into the type of students that make up the Winthrop student body. I love to study and get good grades. I fit right in at Winthrop. For this reason, I am hoping I receive this scholarship so that I can continue at Winthrop in Spring 2014., 457291=You really CAN'T beat it. Washington Monthly named Winthrop one of America\u00e2??s \u00e2??Best Bang for the Buck Colleges\u00e2?? in its 2013 College Guide Rankings edition. Nationally, Winthrop was ranked 93rd out of 349 public and private universities and colleges that were named \u00e2??Best Bang for the Buck.\u00e2?? In the master\u00e2??s degree-granting category for the value ranking, Winthrop came in at 37th out of 152 institutions. Both of my parents are working 2 jobs each to try to send me to Winthrop. However, although this is the very best school for the money, I have been unable to secure the funding to continue at Winthrop. Your help would be greatly appreciated., 440378=Ghost Tours in October to share more about Winthrop's History, 289580=Worth the money. Small student body, small student to teacher ratio (about 15:1 at most). Lots to do on and off campus, just about everything you need in walking distance., 506089=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 460996=Winthrop is a GREAT school because of it's student support system at the Student Resource Center. As a result my persistence and their willingness to help me, my first semester grades improved with each exam. For this reason, I am hoping that I obtain this scholarship so that I will be able to continue at Winthrop University in Spring 2014.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here I have never had better relationships with teachers as I have had in my first two semesters here. Am learning a lot I never thought I'd learn so much pursuing a Computer Science degree from a liberal arts college. The classes are small so you receive individual attention from teachers who really care, and are more than willing to meet with you after class to help you with anything.
