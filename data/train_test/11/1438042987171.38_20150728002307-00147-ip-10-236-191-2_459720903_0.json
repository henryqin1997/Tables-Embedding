Rootfs over encrypted lvm over raid-1 on GPT Rootfs over encrypted lvm LVM Install Guide GUID Booting Guide Advanced users may be interested in the following topics: Filesystem Resources If you have a system disk that is 2TB or greater and want to use the space beyond 2TB, you must partition using the GPT/GUID format. Otherwise, MBR is recommended as the most reliable boot method. Important Requires bootloader with support for GPT such as GRUB 2, EXTLINUX, or a patched version of GRUB Legacy Requires legacy BIOS boot partition (~32 MB) to be created if system does not use EFI Supports hundreds of partitions per disk of any size Supports 2 TB+ hard drives for booting Newer format for Linux systems Recommended if your disk is >2TB in size GPT Partitions Due to the fact that it is more widely",
    "textAfterTable": "Partitioning Using fdisk (MBR) Important If you need to create a GPT partition table, see Partitioning using gdisk. Note These install instructions assume you are installing Funtoo Linux to an hard disk using Master Boot Record partition tables (MBR). If you are installing Funtoo Linux on a machine where another OS is installed, there is an existing Linux distribution on your system that you want to keep or any other scenario (such as differing swap size requirements), then you will need to adapt these instructions to suit your needs. fdisk is the tool used to create an MBR partition table. MBR is well-supported on PCs and is recommended if your system disk is 2TB or smaller. Preparation First, it's a good idea to make sure that you've found the correct hard disk to partition. Try this command and verify that /dev/sda is the disk that you want to partition:  # fdisk -l /dev/sda Disk /dev/sda: 640.1 GB, 640135028736 bytes, 1250263728 sectors Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes Disk label type: gpt # Start End Size Type Name 1 2048 1250263694 596.2G Linux filesyste Linux filesystem Now, it's recommended that you erase any existing MBR or GPT partition tables",
