The return of Rashard Mendenhall should be a shot in the arm to their run game, and their defense will have some fun with Michael Vick. Pittsburgh gets the hard-fought win., 162705=The crash landing continues for the Jets against a Texans team that remains undefeated and looks as unstoppable as\u2014dare I say it\u2014the 2007 Patriots. Home-field advantage is worthless when J.J. Watt is wrecking nearly every offensive play in the backfield., 151176=These two teams are evenly matched, with the four losses between the two teams coming to teams that are a combined 15-1 this season. This is a different Broncos team than it was in January, but I can't help remembering the 45-point shellacking Tom Brady and the Patriots put on these guys in the playoffs., 187810=Copyright \u00a9 2015 Bleacher Report, Inc.

Ryan Mathews and Jackie Battle will flourish against the Saints run defense, but Sunday's home game is where this winless team makes its stand.}",

This win might not be pretty, but the Arizona D leads them to 5-0. \u00a0 Miller: Rams The Cardinals' luck has to run out sometime. Right? The Rams are tough at home, and they have the right mix of hard-hitting defense and efficient offense to get an early lead against Arizona and hold on for a win. \u00a0 Nagler: Cardinals If it wasn't for the fact that it will be played in a dome, this game would resemble an old-school blood-and-guts battle. First one to 13 wins. \u00a0 Langland: Rams The Rams look relatively unbeatable at home, even when they don't score an offensive touchdown. This is the week Arizona's undefeated streak finally ends.
