They tilled the land and built big barns and homes. Since then, they have come to be known as the Pennsylvania Dutch. One of the more popular dishes was slippery pot pie, made with square noodle dough cooked with either beef or chicken and its broth, along with potatoes and onions. A crumb pie, called shoo-fly pie, and funeral pie, a combination of raisins and lemon, were also favored., 32496=Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Brunswick Beacon is your source for local news, sports, events and information in Brunswick County, North Carolina and surrounding areas.}",
