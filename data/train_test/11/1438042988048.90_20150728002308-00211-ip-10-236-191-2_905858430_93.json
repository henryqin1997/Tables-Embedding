Don't let them look at your transcripts (if you are a transfer) and then just say you need to take certain classes. Make sure they sit down with you and give you an actual plan that you can follow. They didn't do that with me and I was planning on graduating in the Fall of 2013 so I could transfer to another state with an associates, and come to find out they were giving me the wrong classes towards my degree. I spoke with a counselor and was told I was still 5 classes short. I never saw the same counselor twice, so I was getting conflicting information all the time., 409672=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

In the years that I have attended this college I have not had any problems regarding this. I feel safe, even when I take night classes. Clubs and Activities There are many clubs and activities going on during the semesters. They have the Honors Program, SGA (Student Government Association), Phi Theta Kappa club and many activities. Some activities promote physical health, like \u2018Race for the Cure,\u2019 and some are to help the least fortunate like food donations. Other activities are for students, for example Art Festivals and Art exhibitions. These are competition among students; the winner either gets money, a lap tops, an iPad etc. Great for these types of students",
