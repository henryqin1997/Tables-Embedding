            "There's a club for almost everything. It's extremely easy to find something you're interested in. And if you're not sure if you're interested, then you'll still find something you'll like.",
            "Motivated, inspired",
            "The Fence is the absolute best thing ever!",
            "Pittsburgh is an incredible city. There is always something going on. I would recommend trying different street car foods, going to the Strip District, climbing up the Cathedral of Learning, and exploring every district of Pittsburgh. Each area has a distinctness to it that's very interesting to compare.",
            "The food on campus tends to get tedious, but luckily, Pittsburgh as a city has a wide array of cuisines at cheap, college-kid tailored prices.",
            "Dorm life is great and luxurious. CMU provides several on campus housing options and a great RA staff. Adjusting well is a given.",
            "This school is hard. It's filled with bright and innovative students, thus creating quite a competitive and sometimes intimidating atmosphere. But if you adopt the philosophy work hard, play hard, you will enjoy the academics here.",
            "Orientation is the most embarrassing, yet useful time you get in the entire school year to make friends. The friends you make during Orientation Week are the friends you keep throughout the year. Also, make sure you check out the general education requirements for the school you've applied to. Those make all the difference.",
            "Carnegie Mellon University is a strong university for anyone interested in modern technology and the changing world. The people here are enterprising and ambitious, and you will be sure to find yourself in inspiring companionship. For someone who knows what they want to do and how to get there, CMU is the perfect place to start and thrive."

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck While it is an expensive institution to attend, the prestige and reputation hold true. CMU provides a strong background in any field, but it also provides a variety of diversity and experience that are invaluable and certainly prepare for life after college. Am enjoying being here Even though CMU has a reputation for all work and no play, there is surprisingly always something to do, both academically and socially. In the classroom, many professors are casual and approachable. Outside the classroom, there are many organizations, sports teams, dance troupes, concerts, musicals, and other social events at which to meet people...and that's just on campus! The city of Pittsburgh also has much to offer, including shopping, the arts, and food! Am learning a lot I am a freshman, so a lot of my courses are introductory and relate to courses I took in high school (ie - biology) and I am therefore familiar with the material. But I have learned a lot more detail, especially in my science courses. Login to rate or flag the reviews Jacob from Pittsburgh, PA",
