    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{122504=During the year 2011-2012 Western Illinois University has had a low academic rate. Besides the ratings i believe that if a student is serious about their academics they will do just fine. The professors are great and it is up to the student on what kind of grades they would like to obtain., 494398=Western is roughly $21,000 for a student coming in for Fall 2013. The rates adjust with every new class. The rate is locked in meaning it will never increase so you will always know what to expect depending on how many credit hours you take. For the price of $21,000 you are receiving exactly what you're paying for. Students often complain about the stuff we don't have but we're not exactly paying a lot of money. We have free transportation to and from Walmart and the other stores in our city and the computer lab offers free printing. The bookstore is an arm and a leg but that's at most schools. Western doesn't offer a lot of book vouchers., 526114=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 166193=Who like a crowd but not too big of a crowd. Great Class Sizes 22:1, 153799=At Western Illinois, these are referred to as Residence Halls. They are currently renovating multiple Residence Halls at WIU because most of them were built in the 1970's and were not built to last. The biggest downfall of the Residence Halls is the inconsistent temperature control in the rooms. WIU will not turn on Air Conditioning until June, leaving the spring semester finals to be dreadfully hot. The Resident Advisers, or RA's do a great job of holding educational meetings for the students to attend and see what the town and university have to offer. If there is a problem with roommates or others on the floor, the office of Student Development works well with the students to accommodate their needs. Most incoming Freshmen are excited to experience college in the only way they have seen, by drinking. Office of Public Safety makes regular rounds on the weekends down the halls of the buildings and will not be afraid to look into open rooms. Most of the Residence Halls are Dry meaning alcohol cannot be brought into the building, this means even empty bottles will result in a fine or violation. If there are any damages on your floor, you and everyone else will be fined, I would advice working together with the other floormates to ensure that does not happen.}",

It's a great way to transition with someone else who is it your same situation. Bang for the buck Once you apply and are for sure going here, your tuition will never change if the university decided to up the tuition price Am enjoying being here I love it here because it's only 2 hours from home.
