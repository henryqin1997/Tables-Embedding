No. 60/045,322, filed May 1, 1997; U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60/056,507, filed Aug. 21, 1997, and U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60/056,533, filed Aug. 21, 1997., 77469=The exact configuration of the gripping and releasing mechanism 22 (or 122 or 222) when in its maximum expanded deployed position will depend upon the relative flexure characteristics of the fixed flexure elements 20 (or 120 or 220) with respect to the movable flexure elements 64 (or 164 or 264). Where the movable flexure elements flex more readily than the fixed flexure elements, the latter tend to remain with their free ends displaced only radially outwardly as is the case with the fixed flexure elements 120 and movable flexure elements 164 in the cannula assembly 1122 of FIGS. 7-9. In this case, the movable flexure elements do not have much tendency to move the free ends of the fixed flexure elements in an annular direction in addition to the radially outward direction. However, as the relative flexure characteristics are changed to a relationship in which the fixed flexure elements are more readily flexed than the movable flexure elements, the movement of the fixed flexure elements become more influenced by the flexure characteristics of the movable flexure elements. In this case, the free ends of the fixed flexure elements will have a significant annular movement in addition to their radially outward movement when reaching the maximum expanded deployed position as is the case with the cannula assemblies 12 and 212 of FIG. 1-6 and 10-11. The result is that the fixed flexure elements each assume a more or less spiral configuration.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes It thus will be seen that the objects of this invention have been fully and effectively accomplished. It will be realized, however, that the foregoing preferred specific embodiment has been shown and described for the purpose of this invention and is subject to change without departure from such principles. Therefore, this invention includes all modifications encompassed within the spirit and scope of the following claims. It will be understood that the availability of the interior of the central tubular member 16 enables the device 10 to be used with an electrohydraulic lithotripter probe as well as any known laser fiber lithotripter probe in order to accomplish the lithotropsy. A laser is discharged through the fiber 18 to the stone imparting energy enough to break it into smaller fragments. This lithotripsy will usually result in displacing smaller stone fragments outside the confines of the fixed flexure elements 22 with larger fragments which, if not too large, can be retrieved through the ureter with the scope. The smaller fragments can be retrieved by subsequent similar procedures. In situations where the size of the stone is too large to be simply retrieved, it can then be broken up. To accomplish the breaking action, a laser fiber 18 is advanced through the proximal end of the central tubular member 16 until it becomes visible at the distal end adjacent the gripped stone. In the use of the medical retrieving",
