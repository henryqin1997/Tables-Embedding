Then, 100 \u03bcL of blank plasma was added respectively, vortexed for 5 min, to obtain standard working solutions at concentrations of 11.14, 55.7, 111.4, 278.5, 557 and 1140 ng/mL. Then, the samples were pretreated with exactly the same procedure as described in Section 2.3. Each concentration level was prepared in six replicates. To evaluate linearity, plasma calibration curves were prepared and assayed in duplicate on six consecutive days over the range 11.4\u20131140 ng/mL for TA-III with the same concentration (1480 ng/mL) for IS. The contents of TA-III in the test samples were calculated using the regression parameters obtained from the standard curve. The acceptance criteria for a calibration curve were that each back-calculated standard concentration must be within 15% deviation from the nominal value except at the LLOQ, for which maximum acceptable deviation was set at 20%. The LLOQ was defined as the lowest concentration that gave a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of \u226510. The LOD demonstrated that the concentration that gave a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 3., 21344=Three QC samples (11.14, 557, 1114 ng/mL) were placed at room temperature (25 \u00b0C) for 24 h, then pretreated with exactly the same procedure as described in Section 2.3, to evaluate the stabilities of unpreparative sample at room temperature. Each concentration level was prepared in six replicates., 20405=To evaluate the absolute matrix effect on the ionization of TA-III and IS, the peak areas of the compounds dissolved in the blank samples with three concentrations of TA-III (11.14, 557, 1114 ng/mL) and IS (1480 ng/mL) were compared with those of the compounds only dissolved in methanol. The corresponding peak areas of TA-III or IS in spiked plasma post-extraction (A) were then compared with those of the solution standards in methanol (B) at equivalent concentrations. The ratio (A/B \u00d7 100%) is defined as the absolute matrix effect., 27140=The selectivity of the method was investigated by analyzing six individual blank plasma samples. The chromatographic findings of each control drug-free plasma containing neither analyte nor internal standard (double blank) were compared with the spiked rat plasma containing TA-III (557 ng/mL) and IS (1480 ng/mL) and the plasma sample was collected at 0.5 h after an oral dose of 50 mg/kg TA-III to check the absence of interference., 30959=The analyses were performed on an Agilent 1290 Series high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Agilent, USA), equipped with a G4220A binary pump, a G4226A autosampler and a G1316C thermosttated column compartment. An Agilent 6460A Triple Quad LC/MS equipped with an electrospray source was connected to the HPLC system. An Agilent Eclipse XDB-C18 column (50 mm \u00d7 2.0 mm, 1.8 \u03bcm) was used for liquid chromatographic separation., 41645=A rapid sensitive and selective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed for determination of timosaponin AIII (TA-III) in rat plasma, using ginsenoside Re as an internal standard (IS). TA-III and the IS were detected in MRM mode with a negative ionization electrospray mass spectrometer. The calibration curves were linear over the concentration ranges from 11.14 to 1114 ng/mL and the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 11.14 ng/mL. Intra-day and inter-day precisions (RSD) were within 10%, and accuracy ranged from 6.4% to 9.1%. The extraction recovery at three concentrations ranged from 92.3% to 95.5%. The validated method was successfully applied to monitor the concentrations of TA-III in rat plasma after intragastric administration. The best fit pharmacokinetic model to estimate the pharmacokinetic parameters was a single compartment model with weight of 1/x2 for oral administration groups of rats for TA-III., 23754=The three concentration-spiked (11.14, 557 and 1114 ng/mL) plasma samples containing TA-III were prepared, and then pretreated with exactly the same procedure as described in Section 2.3. Each level was pretreated in six replicates. At the same time, 100 \u03bcL standard solution of TA-III (11.14, 557 and 1114 ng/mL), together with 20 \u03bcL standard solution of IS (7.4 \u03bcg/mL), were respectively transferred to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen. Then, 100 \u03bcL post-preparative blank plasma was added respectively to redissolve. Each concentration level was prepared in six replicates. The recoveries (extracted recovery) of TA-III from rat plasma after the extraction procedure were determined by comparing the peak areas of extracted TA-III or IS in spiked plasma sample with the area of TA-III or IS of the same concentration level dissolved in the post-preparative blank plasma (the final solution of blank plasma after extraction and dissolution with the initial mobile phase solution)., 20944=Three QC samples (11.14, 557, 1114 ng/mL) were detected after the three freeze\u2013thaw cycles at \u221220 \u00b0C. Each concentration level was prepared in five replicates., 26591=The stock standard solutions of TA-III and IS were prepared by dissolving accurately weighed individual compounds in volumetric flasks with methanol to give a final concentration of 5.57 and 7.40 mg/mL, respectively. A series of standard working solutions at concentrations of 11.14\u20131140 ng/mL for TA-III were obtained by adequate dilution of the standard stock solution with methanol. IS working solution (7.40 ng/mL) was prepared by diluting its stock solution with methanol. All solutions were stored at 4 \u00b0C and brought to room temperature (20 \u00b0C) before use., 21762=Three QC samples (11.14, 557, 1114 ng/mL) were pretreated with exactly the same procedure as described in Section 2.3, at room temperature (25 \u00b0C) for 24 h, to evaluate the post-preparative stabilities at room temperature. Each concentration level was prepared in six replicates., 20657=Three QC samples (11.14, 557, 1114 ng/mL) were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C, detected on the first and 50th day. Each concentration level was prepared in five replicates.}",
