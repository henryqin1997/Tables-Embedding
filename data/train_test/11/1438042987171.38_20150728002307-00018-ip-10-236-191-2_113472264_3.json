The October 2000 reprint is substantively identical to the original Policy promulgated in 1986 to implement the Health Research Extension Act of 1985 (Public Law 99-158). Citations and addresses are updated, and language that was clarified in a 1996 reprint to eliminate common areas of confusion has been retained. Contact OLAW at olaw@od.nih.gov to request obtain copies of the reprint. Laboratory Animal Management and Technology Conference Scheduled October 13, 2000: A Management and Technology Conference is planned for February 10-13, 2001, in Memphis, Tennessee. The conference will focus on the management and technology needs of the laboratory animal science community, emphasizing information pertinent to the day-to-day management of laboratory animal facilities and enhanced career development. The meeting is being co-sponsored by OLAW, the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Meharry Medical College, the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science, and the Laboratory Animal Management Association.
