This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1986 it has nearly tripled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +26% per year. These returns cover a period from 1986-2011 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly, an independent accounting firm., 23037=Over the last 30 days, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate has risen only by a penny to a loss of 35 cents for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2013 while there was no change in estimate for the first quarter of fiscal 2014., 23301=Likewise, for fiscal 2014, during the last 30 days, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate increased only by a penny to a loss of $1.25 while for fiscal 2015, the current estimate stood at a loss of 47 cents, which was 12 cents below the earlier estimate., 21768=For the fiscal year 2014, in the last 30 days, out of the 29 estimates, only one estimate moved downward while four moved in the opposite direction. For fiscal 2015, out of the 33 estimates, none have slashed their estimates, while seven have revised their estimates upward over the same period., 14825=by Mark Vickery \u00a0\u00a0Published on December 17, 2012 |, 62543=Copyright \u00a9 2015 Zacks Investment Research, 21038=Total revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 was $2,873 million, down by a whopping 31% year over year but way head of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,478 million., 19966=Research In Motion Ltd., is scheduled to release its fiscal third-quarter 2013 (ended November 30, 2012) results on Thursday, December 20, after the closing bell.

GAAP net loss in the second quarter was $235 million or a loss of 45 cents per share compared to a net income of $329 million or 63 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.
