The pleated nonwoven product specifically comprised nylon fibers (20 weight percent), cotton fibers (60 weight percent) and polyester fibers (20 weight percent). FIG. 12 illustrates that the increase of the lower cost cotton fiber content to 60% does not reduce the sound absorption characteristics. Therefore, it is possible to optimize the cost of the product based on performance characteristics other than sound absorption., 40346=FIG. 13 compares two 660 gram/m2 samples of the invention with two 1540 gram/m2 samples of the invention. The pleated nonwoven product specifically comprised 18 denier polypropylene (100 weight percent). This evaluation of polypropylene was performed to compare the sound absorption characteristics thereof to the polyester product and to the similar products containing natural fibers., 34564=FIG. 7 illustrates a graph comparing the compression resistance of cross-lapped and urethane foam materials with a pleated nonwoven product formed in accordance with FIGS. 1-3. More specifically, the cross-lapped product was a \ufffd inch thick pad of polyester and nylon fibers. The foam material was a \ufffd inch thick pad of cast urethane foam having a density of 3 pounds per cubic foot. The vertically oriented fiber pleats of the present invention were formed of 80% polyester fibers by weight and 0% co-polyester fibrous binder in the form of a \ufffd inch thick pad having a weight of 1250 grams/m2. This graph illustrates that the compression resistance characteristics of the invention closely approximate those of the cast urethane foam pad. Advantageously, however, the pad of the present invention is 30% lighter in weight than the cast urethane foam and presents a less expensive alternative to foam. On the other hand, the cross-lapped pad loses its compression characteristics rapidly beginning at about 40% compression of total thickness. For this reason, cross-lapped pads may serve as sound insulation, however, these pads are not desirable as a carpet underpad., 39043=FIG. 11 compares two 600 gram/m2 samples of the invention with two 1240 gram/m2 samples of the invention. The pleated nonwoven product specifically comprised nylon fibers (40 weight percent), cotton fibers (40 gram weight) and PET fibers (20 weight percent). The graph of FIG. 11 illustrates essentially the same general characteristics as FIG. 9, but when compared to FIG. 9, FIG. 11 illustrates that the number of binding points or type of binder does not have a significant effect on the absorption characteristics. Polyethylene will have more binding points than PET. Also, a 100% increase in the natural fiber content of the product does not improve the absorption characteristics., 37743=More specifically, FIG. 9 compares two 560 gram/m2 samples of the invention with two 1300 gram/m2 samples of the invention. The pleated nonwoven product specifically comprised nylon fibers (40 weight percent), cotton fibers (40 weight percent), and polyethylene fibers (20 weight percent). The graph of FIG. 9, taken alone, indicates that heavier weight pads of the invention will produce better sound absorption characteristics than lower weight pads of the invention. This characteristic holds true for each of the test procedures represented in FIGS. 9-13., 38344=FIG. 10 compares two 600 gram/m2 samples of the invention with two 1250 gram/m2 samples of the invention. The pleated nonwoven product specifically comprised polyester fibers (80 weight percent) and polyester fibrous binder (20 weight percent). This graph illustrates the improvement of the sound absorption characteristics with weight, as mentioned above, and also evidences that the inclusion of natural fibers, i.e., cotton fibers, results in equivalent sound absorption characteristics at lower product weights. This is also beneficial in that natural fibers, such as cotton, generally cost less than typical synthetic fibers used in these applications.}",
