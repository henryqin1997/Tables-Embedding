            "You need to visit the campus, and you will fall in love with it. You will need to choose your major when you apply, but your major can be changed after you are admitted. Competition to get in is tougher every year, so make sure that you have strong extracurricular activities.",
            "While SDSU may have a reputation as a party school (not anymore), academically it is still challenging and they admitted less than 15% of applicants this fall. The weather and the women are beautiful, and I wish you were here. Dorm life is fun, and there is a great support staff."

The average high school GPA for the class of 2017 was a 3.8., 504193=Go to the gym, play bowling at kearny mesa bowl since the aztec center is closed until fall 2013, go to the SDSU men's basketball games at Viejas Arena or concerts, go to the SDSU Football games at Qualcomm Stadium, and watch sports or listen to music/play video games., 360756=not really big here since the drug bust in 2007. many sororities/fraternities were suspended., 245933=There's a lot to do in San Diego! A cultural feast. Get a copy of the local weekly magazine, The Reader, when you arrive. Balboa Park alone has over 20 museums, biking and jogging paths, huge gardens, Spanish Village with an old California feel and artisans' shops, and hospitality houses from many countries. If you're a foreign student, go there for local information and socializing. The Park also hosts the Earth Fair every April. Movie theatres near campus show an eclectic array of films. The beaches are wonderful for surfing, relaxing and playing with your dog., 454032=The school is becoming increasingly difficult to gain acceptance to. For those hoping to transfer, keep in mind that there is a followup application due in January., 399492=food is tasty, but there could be more options. the associated students building which is set to open fall of 2013 will have great dining choices., 313617=I am an incoming freshman, and I will be attending in Fall 2015. I have some friends that go here, and they say that you should be very careful with the party scene here on campus. There are a lot of parties that you can go to, but always make sure to be careful!}",

The college is full of beautiful nature which includes hundreds of different types of plants, flowers, and trees. In the middle of the school is a coy pond full of fish and turtles, this pond is so relaxing to visit during a break or just to lie down on the grass and take a nap. If you want to go outside the college area there are beaches and parks in very close distance. Students that want or are interested in joining a fraternity or sorority, our Greek system is fantastic and has a huge range from the Pan-Hellenic to cultural fraternities and sororities. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find one that is perfect for you; it\u2019s a great way to be social and make new friends! Active students will enjoy the many different sports SDSU has to offer from division to intramural",
