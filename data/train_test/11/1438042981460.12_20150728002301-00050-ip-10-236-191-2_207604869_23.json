You will never fly those heavies alone again. It will not only run on FSX, but also accommodate FS 2004. So, for die-hard FS9 lovers, this is one more reason to stick to the good old one. Of course we are talking from a performance perspective.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "\u00a0 How do the various editions compare? Multi Crew Experience builds on Microsoft SAPI 5\u00ae outstanding technology, that brings speech recognition, as well as speech synthesis to the windows\u00ae platform. We have choosen a modular design, that allows you to use, some, or all the features, according to your needs. This makes it easier to integrate. It will also play nicely, when used alongside other third party add-ons. It is fully multithreaded, and was designed with performance in mind. How does it work? For non native English speakers, this constitutes a great practice tool. If you are seeking an international career, as an airline pilot, you must interact well with other crew members, in English. What better tool to boost your confidence! One of the bad aspects of home flight simulation, is that it makes you breed bad habits, like trying to fly a B747 on your own, or looking for keyboard key strokes to interact with ATC. Anyone who wants to make the home flight simulation experience as real as it can get. Trainee pilots can use it as a tool, to practice multi crew interaction and ATC phraseology. Who may benefit from this application: Multi Crew Experience is a new add-on to the award winning, Microsoft Flight Simulator X, and FS2004\u00ae software. It adds the missing elements, like crew coordination, interactive checklist reading, realistic ATC operation, call-outs and warnings against deviation from standards, as well as extras, like user interface voice control.

The requirements are the same as those specified for running Microsoft Flight Smulator X, or Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004, depending on which simulator version you use, plus a decent sound card( even onboard one) as well as a headset with good quality microphone. We strongly advise you to refrain from buying until you had a chance to try our software. This will allow you to decide whether this application meets your expectations. If you have not tried our software yet, go to the download page where a time limited, fully functional version is available for download Because your specific hardware configuration will have such an impact on the overall experience, we think this is the way to go. Another reason is that, after you buy, and we issue the licence, there is no way for us to stop you from using it, so it would be unfair to us. Therefore, all sales are considered final and assume that you have tried, and are happy to carry on using our software, and no refund will be considered. Multi Crew Experience User Interface screenshots Bear in mind, that the user interface is only a tiny part of the application, and you will only interact with it a couple of times, mainly to setup your preferences. The core of the program lies in the invisible part, that works in the background. Please click on the picture to see a detailed description. \u00a0",
