Chem., 22, 595-598, 1950., 100878=The authentication of the patterns for some of the narcotics (codeine (anhydrous free base), codeine monohydrate (free base), dihydrocodeinone (free base), protopine) on the basis of single-crystal data has been extended to dl-methadone hydrobromide, dl-methadone hydrochloride, dl-alphaprodine hydrochloride, dl-betaprodine hydrochloride, papaverine (free base), and papaverine hydrochloride, since this paper was completed in 1953 (see Barnes, W. H. and Forsyth, W. J., Unit Cell, Space Group, and Indexed X-Ray Diffraction Powder Data for Certain Narcotics. I-V., Can. J. Chem., 32, 984-995, 1954). Furthermore, a Fifth Set of Data Cards, recently issued by the American Society for Testing Materials (1), includes information on dl-methadone hydrobromide (Card 5-0128), dl-methadone hydrochloride (Card 5-0137), morphine sulphate pentahydrate (Card 5-0179), papaverine hydrochloride (Card 5-0279), and codeine phosphate dihydrate (Card 5-0345), supplied by Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, Indiana, and obtained with Cu radiation. Agreement with the present results for dl-methadone hydrobromide, dl-methadone hydrochloride, and papaverine hydrochloride is good in so far as d values are concerned, although the Lilly data generally are slightly lower; there are greater differences among the I/I 1 estimations, in part perhaps owing to the different radiation employed. On the appropriate A.S.T.M. cards, &lambda=1.5374 (kX); for direct comparison with present values, the d's of these cards, therefore, should be increased by almost 0.3% (equivalent to the use of &lambda=l.5418?). In the case of papaverine hydrochloride no line of d=8.77 (A.S.T.M. Card 5-0279) should appear according to the single-crystal data., 106021=Handbook of Chemistry and Physics (Chem.

The basic principles and techniques of the method have been outlined in the preceding paper ([2] ) 1 of this group of articles on Physical Methods for the Identification of Narcotics. The primary object of the present paper is to provide tabulated data and characteristic X-ray diffraction powder photographs for eighty-three narcotics, including some hydrates and a few optical isomers and their racemoids. At the same time a number of notes on particular compounds, with the investigation of which difficulties or special points of interest were encountered, are included in the",
