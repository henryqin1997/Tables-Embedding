We are in contact to find a solution so please wait until we know what to do. Order in Germany (each for himself or as a group, not clear yet) could be as cheap as a 10pack. We are in contact with pulster.de and will be contacted form pulster about the price. We will contact you guys in the Z\u00fcrich list as soon as we know more --Tuxfux.ch 10:26, 6 June 2008 (UTC) Alexandre Ghisoli will not organize the second 10pack, since the order moved in the Lucca's group., 94670=Let's see if we can get ten people together for this. I'm willing to organise the local distribution if we can. Spread the word and try to get more locals interested in it. Yogiz 08:22, 3 June 2008 (UTC), 196936=1x 10 Pack ordered from pulster for the group Z\u00fcrich! Read more below --Tuxfux.ch 17:20, 28 June 2008 (UTC), 200397=Figures accurate as of 4th Jun 2008 from UBS: 1EUR = 1.54USD and 1USD = 1.04CHF., 167840=After discussion on the talk page, a number of us have decided to place an individual order at Pulster.eu, because they are cheaper than the group sale discount, and they deliver a receipt with VAT. I'd advise the people on this group sale-list to do the same. You can indeed place a group order at Pulster.eu, but that won't lower the price, and would only add extra shipping costs. (from the person who made the group-order to the individual members of the group) MadJo 11:04, 30 June 2008 (UTC), 236481=The 10-pack purchase was made around 9A on July 3rd - they are on the way! There are 11 requests for 10 phones - they will be assigned in the order that payment clears., 204556=List already contains 30 people! -- I changed from 20 -> 30 Devices in this order. --Tuxfux.ch 18:48, 3 June 2008 (UTC), 254747=Status: 16/20 at 2008-05-24, 247799=Status: 10/10 (Full - Order placed 11:30 AM EDT July 3, 2008), 234896=Status: 11/10 (As of July 4th, 2008), 227985=The first 10 confirmed from both lists will get the units, probably on the 7th July. Bring US $396.66 ($369 + $26.753 tax + $0.907 shipping) cash (no checks) for pickup. I'll try to make a copy of the receipt for everyone. The 10 pack is ordered! I'll let you know when I get them, or can pick them up., 216112=The list was extended to 30 3 are still remaining\u00a0! --Habi 11:43, 6 July 2008 (UTC), 177065=As of 2008-07-03 (exchange rate 0.7505), US$369 is worth NZ$492 and US$25.81 is worth NZ$34.39, 64099=NO OpenMoko FreeRunner 900/1800 available anymore (on July 3, 2008 at 21h) as needed in Europe. Furthermore, confirmation: From Pulster.eu: Our sales price is 299 EUR + shipping 15 EUR in Europe = 314 EUR. The idea of \"open\" is ours. So check our price calculation: if you order the Freerunner from Taiwan, it's 399 USD + 100 USD shipping + c. 90 USD \"import taxes\" inside Europe. Total 589 USD = c.380 EUR. So it will be cheaper and we Europeans have 2 years of warranty when buying from Pulster, instead of a 14 days(?) for imported goods.}",
