            "Campus Security works 24/7 even through natural disasters. There are almost 300 officers working all over campus. You will see them in cars, on segways, jeeps, scooters, bikes, in buildings, dorms and also in houses checking cars coming into the university.",
            "Almost every fraternity and sorority you can think of including Christian sororities and fraternities",
            "Over 300 clubs and organizations to join.",
            "Campus is lively everyday. With over 300 student organizations, campus events planned by Student Affairs, there is something fun to do. Even if it's nothing but sitting on the yard with friends, you are going to have fun.",
            "You have many options when it comes to eating. You can eat in the cafe which is different everyday and Thursdays are Soul Food Thursdays or you can eat in what is called the Punchout (Food Court) which has Chinese food, sub shop, pizza place, pasta place and a chicken place. If you want to take your special someone on a date, there is also an elegant restaurant that you can go to.",
            "Living in the dorms, everyone becomes your brother/sister. Freshman live in same sex dorms so you'll develop a bond that will last. You get to the point where you study together, eat together and hang out together.",
            "The courses are rigorous. All professors have their Ph.D and give you the best resources possible. It's up to you whether you are receptive and willing to work hard or give up because it seems like it's too much for you.",
            "If you really want to get the education and skill necessary to make it in this country, Howard University is the place. Make sure you have good test scores, leadership capabilities, good work ethic and a people person.",

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{279349=Howard University is know for its epic Homecoming Celebrations. The biggest celebrities, music artist, stylist and experts from around the world travel to DC to help us celebrate our Homecoming festivities in style with a week filled with traditional events such as the Gospel Show, Comedy Show, Fashion Show and ultimately the Greek Step Show and most importantly Football Game. Homecoming is in mid to late October every year! Resfest, a competition between all the dormitories is the next biggest event and tradition at Howard, after Homecoming. Teams are formed from each dormitory to compete in Debate, Sports, Strolling, Dancing and most importantly Stepping for the Resfest Champion Title., 637148=This only got two stars because of the social aspect (and there is supposed to be more dorms built within the next 10 years). Our dorms need major reparations. In order to get the best experience I advise freshman girls to live in the Quad or the Annex, freshman boys should live in Drew Hall. DO NOT live in Meridian Hill Hall, it is a sophomore dorm and will deprive you from your freshman experience because it is a sophomore dorm and it is off campus. If you get placed there, have your parents call and complain. In around February, you'll have to pay $200 if you want to live on campus the following year. There is also a dorm that is way off campus (about 30 minutes total from campus) called University Town Center in Hyattsville, MD. It is metro- accessible and if you are used to a full kitchen and living room, this is the place for you (I recommend sophomores and up)., 715738=Stay on financial information. Register for classes in April., 459026=The dorm bathrooms and hallways are cleaned everyday and all the dorms are in great shape! In Fall 2014 there will be two new dorms housing Freshman girls and Sophomores., 864142=Check your teachers on ratemyprofessor.com and if your not an early morning person stay away from 8:10 classes. It will only lead to missing class., 930308=From recent reports, the tuition has increased by a significant amount since 2012, and that is unfortunate. From my experience, Howard has not always appropriated its funds in the best way, with the majority of the money not being sewn back into the university. With that being said, although you will have at least one score to settle or obstacle created by administration in need of a major reconstruction, you will have the memories of Homecoming and your own personal Howard experience to look forward to. So, depends on how you look at it, it may be worth it., 183290=Be yourself, the rest will follow! Get involved, whatever you can get your hands on that you are good at, do it! Volunteer, join a team or club, anything. Just get involved. GO TO CLASS! Howard has a lot of distractions, you can not let the glamour and fun take you way from your main focus! Do not get caught up in the graduating on time, there is no such thing. If an opportunity presents itself for you to study abroad or do a co-op, DO IT! Even if it means adding a semester or 2. (however make sure you have the funds to cover all of your time) Go to everything 10-30 minutes early. No matter the event or class you will benefit greatly from being early (including the cafe line) Get all of your financial aid/registration started as early as possible. If FASA opens on January 1st @ 12:00am, be there to fill it out by January 1st 12:01am. Do NOT wait until the week something is due because issues always arise and you will want time to attend to it. Stay on top of financial aid office, they are not very organized at times, and they have a lot of students to handle. Unfortunately its not all about you. Go to teachers office hours, and go often!! It benefits greatly if the teacher knows who you are and sees that you are making an effort, plus its added learning time. Don't spend you whole time planing your life, that you for get to live You miss 100% of the shoots you don't take. Take risks!, 854135=Homecoming at Howard draws over 6,000 people every September. It is a two week long tradition that spawns multiple events with iconic people., 929403=Howard University is the founding home to the majority of the Divine Nine, so be prepared to see, hear, and experience tons of Black Fraternities and Sororities participating in various events like auctions and pageants in the Fall, and probates in the Spring. The biggest event on campus is Howard Homecoming, which happens typically every October. It is one of the biggest college homecoming weeks in the country. Be prepared for lots of celebrity sightings, parades, and shows. Past guests included: Chaka Khan, Tyrese, Pooch Hall, P. Diddy, Boris Kojoe,Taraji P. Henson, Wendy Raquel Robinson, and much more., 1115936=Student organizations often host parties during the school year.Dancing and socializing are definitely big, and most students do frequent a lot of hip-hop and dance clubs in the area, namely Love and Fur. Homecoming, which occurs every year in the third week of October, is a can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?t-miss event and has been known to draw hundreds of alumni and students from schools all over the country, especially other HBCUs. Even if you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?re not yet 21, you can still enjoy DC\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?s nightlife., 633747=We are the Alpha chapter for most of the black greeks. There is First Fridays in The Punchout where we get to watch them stroll/ step. Also, in April there are the Probates. We have other greeks as well that focus on your major/ minor. They are all great for networking. *Discretion is key*}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Don't party too hard during your first semester. I know several people who will not be able to complete their education at Howard because they were the ones getting ready every Thursday/Friday/Saturday night for the club instead of studying. Also be aware of your surroundings. Travel in large groups during the night and use the shuttles as much as possible so you won't have to worry about walking back to the dorms all the way from the metro. When you're about to buy books for classes, ask upperclassmen and look around campus for flyers of people selling their books for cheaper than the bookstore prices. Join clubs and community service organizations to build up your experience for those future internships and jobs. Stay focused on your grades. It is, after all, the reason why you'll be here in the first place so why not sit down with a friend and study!! Use your professors' office hours and sit in the front of the class. Use study groups for help before big tests and finals. There are so many libraries that you can go for quiet time and research. Lastly, have fun. The next 4 years will change your life forever. Howard has birthed thousands of successful people and the legacy will continue with you if you put forth the effort. Bang for the buck While Howard",
