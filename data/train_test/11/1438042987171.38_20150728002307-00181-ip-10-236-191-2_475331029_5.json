    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{21668=When cobalt and molybdenum were in short supply and commanded a high price, the metals were frequently recovered from the spent catalysts. Even during periods of good metal markets, the efficiency of the recovery of cobalt and nickel was low and most of the active companies concentrated their efforts on molybdenum recovery. However, since the downturn in the economy and the oversupply of metals in 1980-82, economic factors as well as substantial technical difficulties involved have greatly reduced the incentive for the recovery of metals from the spent catalysts. Surprisingly, little effort has been made in the prior art in seeking to recover the inert alumina support which accounts for about sixty percent of the weight of spent catalysts., 53680=300 grams 98% H2 SO4 was added to a slurry of 150 g spent HDS catalyst with 800 g H2 O in a 2-liter, glass-lined titanium autoclave. The autoclave was purged with N2 and then pressurized to 150 psig (11 atm) with H2 S. The autoclave charge was heated to 150\ufffd C. and held at 150\ufffd C. for 1 hour to complete the reaction. After cooling to 25\ufffd C., the autoclave was vented and the product slurry filtered to yield 1058 grams of Al2 (SO4)3 liquor and 51 grams (dry) of sulfide concentrate., 43698=Laboratory screening tests were conducted by reacting concentrated H2 SO4 and spent catalyst in a 2000 cc glass-lined titanium autoclave. The tests were conducted both with and without sulfides. The results of these tests are presented in Tables 1, 2 and 3., 34595=Step (1) is capable of quantitatively converting the Al2 O3 matrix of the catalyst to a solution of Al2 (SO4)3 which is saleable as such while precipitating the cobalt, nickel and/or molybdenum into a solid sulfide mass. The amount of H2 SO4 useful in the practice of the present invention is dependent on the composition of catalyst extrudate being treated, as this determines the acid consumption character of the extrudate. The amount of H2 SO4 used is generally within the range of about 1 to 3 kg of H2 SO4 per kg of catalyst. That is, about 1000 to 3000 kg of H2 SO4 per metric ton of catalyst. Preferably, about 1500 to 2500 kg of H2 SO4 per ton are used. More preferably, about 2000 kg of H2 SO4 are used per ton of typical spent hydrodesulfurization catalyst.}",

Accordingly, it is intended that the foregoing description be considered merely exemplary of the invention and not a limitation thereof. 50 grams of sulfide concentrate (from Example 3) and 200 grams H2 O were added to a 2-liter, glass-lined titanium autoclave. After purging, the autoclave was pressurized to 200 psig (14.6 atm) with O2 and then heated to 200\ufffd C. The reaction was continued for 2 hours at 200\ufffd C. The product slurry in the autoclave was cooled to 25\ufffd C., the autoclave vented, and slurry filtered to yield 33 grams of (crude) MoO3.\ufffdH2 O and 275 milliliters of solution containing Co-Ni values.
