    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{40648=Once we had the roller cam in place, it was time for the power test. To evaluate just the change in the cam, we retained the 1.5:1 roller rockers used with the flat-tappet cam. The first test immediately raised the engine's peak horsepower point to 6,200 rpm from the flat-tappet cam's best horsepower peak of 6,000 rpm. Frankly, we expected the roller's additional 10 degrees of duration to push the rpm peak closer to 6,500 rpm, so 6,200 rpm was mildly disappointing. But the power that we gained was anything but a disappointment with a nice increase to 478 hp. With this simple cam swap, we had just jacked the power by nearly 50 hp. We attributed a majority of the power increase to the roller cam's additional valve lift that bumped the intake lift from the flat tappet's 0.504 to the roller's 0.560 inch, an increase of more than 0.050 inch. Since this added lift really helped the power, we assumed that if some is good, then more is better, so we added a set of 1.6:1 roller rockers to both the intake and exhaust in search of more power., 53320=If you look closely at the Test 2 HP curve (purple), it began experiencing valve float as early as 5,200 rpm and fell off the power curve above 5,900 with the higher ratio rockers on both the intake and exhaust. With more spring pressure, or perhaps a lighter valvespring retainer, we might have been able to use the 1.6:1 rocker ratio on the exhaust. We assumed that the exhaust lobe is quite a bit more aggressive than the intake lobe, causing this problem., 31368=Good ideas have a habit of not always working exactly as they should. We assembled a 0.040-over 350 small-block Chevy in the Jan. '14 issue that we called the Quick Draw .357. It was intended to showcase all the budget engine parts we had tested in the previous year. The parts bolted together easily enough, but the results were less than impressive. Our cam, head, and intake package ran into valve-control problems that limited the peak horsepower to a mediocre 403 hp at 5,400 rpm. We determined that the Lunati cam uses a rather aggressive lobe design that requires a little more valvespring than the Jegs heads were equipped to deliver., 52836=Test 1: This was with the Lunati hydraulic roller cam and 1.5:1 rocker ratios on both the intake and exhaust., 36505=We knew from Jegs' flow numbers that these heads would respond with even more power if we added more valve lift. Adding a 1.6:1 roller rocker arm to increase valve lift on the flat-tappet cam only resulted in lost power, again due to a reoccurrence of valve-control issues. A better solution was to go to a hydraulic roller cam that could add more valve lift. We also decided that with our good crank, rods, and forged pistons, we had the quality parts to allow us to spin the engine a little higher to make more power. This idea comes from the basic premise that if you make the same torque at a higher engine speed, you will make more horsepower. The easiest way to do that is to add a camshaft with more intake and exhaust duration, and this should move the torque curve higher in the engine rpm band. Of course, this almost always also comes at the price of losing power at engine speeds below peak torque., 42689=The problem with adding rocker ratio is that this also increases valve acceleration rate, which makes the valvespring's job more difficult. Most of the time, the spring can handle this increase in valve acceleration. In our case, adding 1.6:1 rocker ratio to both the intake and exhaust resulted in a dramatic loss in power above 5,400 rpm, and the engine suffered serious valve float at about 6,200 rpm when it began popping out of the exhaust. We then experimented by returning to a 1.5:1 rocker on the exhaust side and retaining the 1.6:1 rocker on the intake. This gave us the best power of the session with an excellent 483 hp at 6,200 rpm. While the heavier intake valve usually pushes the intake side into valve float before the exhaust, in this case, our valve control issues might be attributed to a more aggressive lobe design on the exhaust side., 53121=Test 3: We discovered it was the exhaust that caused the power loss, so this test used 1.6:1 roller rockers on the intake side only. This resulted in the best power., 52979=Test 2: Here we added 1.6:1 rockers to both the intake and exhaust. Note how the power dropped off radically.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Valvesprings Specs The red HP1 curve is with the original valvesprings, while the green line (HP2) is with the stronger, conical springs. Note how the weaker springs gave up at around 5,300 rpm, while the conical springs offer improved valve control, making more power starting down as low as 3,700 rpm. That's a 53hp difference at 6,000 rpm! Do you think you'd feel 50 hp in the seat of your pants? Damn straight. Test 2: All we added was better conical Lunati valvesprings. This test also used Westech's dyno headers as opposed to the Hedman headers used in Test 1. Test 1: This is the best power test from Part 1. 7/12 Flat-Tappet Cam Test The next plan was to bolt in a Lunati hydraulic roller cam, so the first thing was to ensure initial lube with a squirt of Lucas Assembly Lube. We didn\u2019t degree this cam but installed it at the same position as the flat-tappet version. 6/12 Overall, we jacked up our 357 small-block with 80 more horsepower while only losing a small amount of torque below 3,500 rpm.
