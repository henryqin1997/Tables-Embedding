            "Like i said before there is a safe rides taxi service for any one in need and also a lot of campus police that really care more about your safety then they do about writing a ticket.",
            "Heavy roots with Greek life on campus, not really my cup of tea because i don't really feel the need to belong to something i think i can do just fine on my own with making friends but that's opinion. If you want to i'm sure its amazing also great for networking after school.",
            "Can't wait to join the chaps organization which is for health admins which is what i am majoring in currently, but there are so many of them its unreal. There is even a club for squirrel watching.",
            "Registered student organizations are plentiful for students who like to get involved and our volunteer center is awesome here.",
            "Nothing much just that there is a deep connection with the Chippewa tribe so don't expect tribal dancing or chants central is a lot more respectful than that.",
            "Great school and one of the cheapest per credit hour in the state.",
            "Go out with friends on weekends central is one of the best party schools in Michigan enjoy it. If anything gets out of hand a safe ride taxi is just a call away and also a taxi service for 3 dollars a ride anywhere close to campus is an awesome deal.",
            "Really nice salad bar wherever you go on campus dinning, love the honey mustard dressing. Everything tastes great to me but i'm not a very picky eater, a lot of greasy food but it is college.",
            "Everything has been amazing everyone is so nice. Got thrown in with a random from northern Michigan, turned out to be a really funny guy and would have hated to not know him.",
            "It is quiet challenging then again it is college, how difficult it is has been talked about for years although i was told how little professors would help and that is not the case here at central.",
            "Get ahead of your school work so you have time for studying. Study with a purpose set a schedule and study a little each day, even if this means going to lecture and just reading over your notes an hour later it will help so much.",
            "My first year here on campus has been a delight. I have enjoyed everything from the people being more then just nice too the simple campus. Everything is within walking distance and the professors actually care about your success."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{765846=Be aware that in the Winter it get COLD and from Dec-Feb you're going to freeze your butt of going to class unless you're prepared to bundle up. The campus is 1.2 miles long, you may end up walking pretty far for a class. Once you get used to it though, it's not a big deal., 12373=The downfall of CMU is that the CMU Promise ended in 2007, and so the price of tuition keeps rising. You're still getting what you paid for, but it is beginning to get more and more costly., 1014437=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 24531=There are so many things to do on and off of Central's campus. Central has a recognized Student Activity Center (the SAC) that has weight rooms, fitness equipment, a pool, 2 saunas, a huge hot tub, racquetball, basket ball, volleyball and walleyball courts available to be reserved until midnight. The SAC often has many events including a movie in the pool where a movie is shown (most recently Inception) in the pool on a huge screen and students watch it in tubes. Access to the SAC is free to all students and it is open from 7-midnight. There is also intramural sports that students can participate in throughout the year with seasons lasting about 5 weeks each. CMU just recently opened the newest addition to campus, the event center. The event center hosts many sport competitions and recently hosted Ke$ha in February. The event center will be the place for many more speakers, comedians, groups, and artists that students can go see. The residential life at Central is amazing with extremely spacious dorm rooms (some of the biggest in the state, if not the Nation) and GREAT food in 4 different residential restaurants. There are also convenience stores with food like Bosco sticks and personal pizzas that are open until 2 a.m. Though Mt. Pleasant is not downtown Ann Arbor or East Lansing, there are many things to do around the city including going to The Soaring Eagle Casino which gives players $20 on their birthdays (not many college campuses have a casino). Mt. Pleasant has clubs, a movie theater, bowling alleys, shops, and many events on Central's campus. Mount Pleasant is big enough that you can keep yourself occupied but not so big that you will become distracted from school., 237702=Central Michigan University is a 4 year degree granting institution in Mt Pleasant, Michigan. It offers many majors and is currently building a medical school to be completed in 2013. It is a big school that has all the benefits of a smaller campus., 252672=I love dorm life at Central. I live in Robinson Hall on North Campus and I live with one other roommate, this costs about $2000 extra. I've met a lot of great friends through my dorm. Also, the RA's and RHA push you to get good grades, help you whenever you need it, and you want to get involved they will help you with that too. I had friends in the East Campus dorms and they seemed to love it. The South Campus dorms, also known as The Towers, are where most freshmen live and get quite noisy at night which gets old rather quickly. The South and East Campus dorms are located near the main road which has a lot of restaurants/bars. They also are located near the gym and stadium., 94646=I am from a small town, so when I chose to attend CMU in the fall of 2010 I was nervous, but once I got there I knew that I chose the right school. I am learning a lot in all of my classes as well as other activities on campus that I can attend. CMU is a big campus, at least for me, with a lot of activities to do. There are lectures/ for every kind of thing you can imagine, 833299=Food was great my first year and was just okay my second year. What was nice about the food was all the different choices. Also, not having to cook for yourself was a great thing as well. However, fresh foods last year 2012 the food was not all that great. They would run out of bagels in the morning and dinner food at night., 660307=The sunday before final exams at 12:00 am, students will open their windows of their dorms and proceed to scream as loud as they can into the night. It's very eery hearing thousands of people screaming on an otherwise quiet night., 16925=Central is not the most expensive public college in Michigan, but it is up there. The tuition costs are not that big of a deal, and there are amenities included in the price such as getting into football games for free and having access to the Student Activity Center. The only part of the cost that might be a little excessive comes with the meal plan costs. The dining halls are only open until 7:00 or 7:30 on weekdays and 6:30 on weekends. This makes eating three meals a day difficult sometimes, and having two meals a day is only a couple hundred dollars cheaper. Other than that, the amount of money it costs to go to Central versus the skills and lessons you learn is definitely worth it., 733987=We have Safe Rides that start at 7:30 pm and if you need a ride they will take you for free. Campus police will also take you for free as well. We have these blue buttons around campus, and if you are in trouble or need help, you push one and the police will come to that location.}",

CMU really has almost every major. It's something for anyone here. Tips for prospective students Best thing to do is to apply for as many scholarships as you can. Central offers scholarships in almost every category. Also like any other college getting a ACT score of 21 and above helps you get perks such as more scholarships an grants offered by the government. If you do attend CMU I would suggest joining some sort of activity. It can",
