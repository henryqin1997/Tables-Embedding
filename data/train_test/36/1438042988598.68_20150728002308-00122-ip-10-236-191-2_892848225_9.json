The food at 1828 caf\u00c3\u00a9 is DELICIOUS!! Hey accept cash, credit, or Flex Dollars, which are included in the meal plan. 1828 is usually pretty crowded, and would probably be more crowded if it were bigger., 92397=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 65238=Average variety this year. Good choices with the amount in the Ames Dining Hall and 1828 cafe, but the chefs don't very often stray from the normal pick of the night. You do get a good amount of food for your money, though, even with the 10 meal plan., 2272=Campus is JUMPING! In Fall 2011, two brand new dorm buildings will open. New student groups are always being created and are coming up with new activities for commuter and resident students alike. I have made more friends here than I did even at my high school! McKendree is home to me, now.}",

Tips for prospective students If you get 30 or above on the ACT, you will have better chances at getting a larger scholarship. Make sure you contact the school about it the fall or early spring before your planned first year so you don't miss the scholarship events. Bang for the buck A fairly expensive college for the area, but they do offer large scholarships for students with good grades. Also, it",
