Thus in this example, the length field (shown in the table as two bytes denoted \"len len\") is always less than 06 00 hexadecimal. As the minimum fixed value specified by any protocol format is 06 00 (hexadecimal), there should be no packets 106 which could be valid under more than one format., 87564=In this third subexample, the 18 99 does not identify the packet 106 as any known type.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While preferred embodiments are disclosed herein, many variations are possible which remain within the concept and scope of the invention, and these variations would become clear to one of ordinary skill in the art after perusal of the specification, drawings and claims herein. Alternative Embodiments The switching engine's speed compares favorably with a switching speed of about 50 to 100 kilopackets per second achieved by devices having a similar clock cycle but not using a switching engine 206 as described herein. The switching engine 206 is capable of fetching two data elements, comparing them, testing a result of a prior comparison, and executing an instruction in response to that result, all in a single clock cycle. The switching engine 206, operating in cooperation with the switching processor 205 and the high-level processor 208, is capable of switching about 300 kilopackets per second or more when operating with a clock cycle of about 30 nanoseconds (for the switching engine 205, twice that for the switching processor 206, and much greater for the high-level processor 208). Switching Engine Speed The switching processor 205 and switching engine 206 may be considered to comprise similar elements, where packets 106, rather than data words, are the elements for fetch and execution. In this view, the instruction fetch element may comprise the network interface 201 and related means for retrieving a packet 106 from a network 102. The execution element",
