As described above, the vehicle frame reinforcing beam for absorbing an impact according to the present invention is capable of evenly distributing the impact in cooperation with the impact delay time and protecting occupants in the vehicle by the increased strength of the vehicle frame. In addition, the inner space of the vehicle is not changed by the installed beam of the present invention. Moreover, it is easy to control the installation position of the beam of the present invention. In addition, since the shorter distance of the elliptical outer pipe is the same as the diameter of the circular inner pipe, the space inside the vehicle is not changed thereby. In the case of the single pipe structure, the thicker the thickness of the pipe, the easier the pipe can be broken by the impact applied thereto. Any crack occurred at a portion of the pipe may quickly cause another crack. However, since the present invention is directed to a double pipe structure comprising the circular inner pipe 4 and the elliptical outer pipe 5 which are separated from each other in their construction, any crack occurring at a",
