            "There are so many clubs and activities on campus. There is always a chance to learn new things and meet new people. There is something for you no matter who you are. Don't be shy, go out and explore.",
            "There is a never ending list of great activities to do around campus. Throughout your years at the University of Akron you will never be bored. There is always something to do. From bowling to movies in the Union theatre, there is never a dull moment.",
            "Depending on your meal there are some really good places to eat on campus. If you have a traditional meal plan your options are limited unfortunately but if you have a Gold plan you can pretty much eat anywhere on campus and a few places off campus. The only not so great thing about college dining is that you sometimes get tired of always eating the same things.",
            "Dorm life is fun but can also be stressful at times. There are so many amazing people to meet. Although living in a dorm isn't cheap, it really is a great experience.",
            "Academics at this university are very good. Sometimes it can become a little stressful and overwhelming. But never ever give up. There is always someone who is willing to help you. Keep your head held high, keep studying and doing all that you can do to succeed."

One can go to the game room to bowl and play pool. One can go to the amazing rec center we here, they can go swimming, rock climbing, play sports there, or just workout. One can join intramural teams for sports. Every week there are movies showing. One can go to any of the home sports games at no additional cost. One can also join organizations in which they find interesting. And finally, every week we have different 9:09 and 7:17 events put on by RHPB and RHC., 193993=The Quaker Square Inn is one of the most unusual hotels in the nation, being built within a grain silo. The Hower House is also a historic house that was built in 1871 by John Henry Hower and is filled with unique treasures and furnishings collected by the Hower family during their travels around the world., 53150=You can tell that the university is using tuition for the benefit of the students. Quite a few new buildings have been built since 2005 and they are still in the process of building new dorms and sports facilities. The teachers here actually want to help you succeed, unlike other colleges where they could care less if you attend class or not. With tuition a lot of things are included such as parking passes, membership to the rec center, and all home games for any sport are free to students (you even get points which earn you free stuff just for going to games!)., 637524=Again, The University of Akron is right in downtown Akron so there is a lot to do in the city. We are also very close to the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, which has hiking, bikini, canoeing, and many other activities! Cleveland is only a 40 minute drive North and Canton is 20 minutes South. If you are looking to stay on campus, there are movies every Thursday-Saturday in the movie theatre. The game room is open 7 days a week and there is always a sporting event. Men's soccer is particularly popular after they won the NCAA championship in 2010., 51936=Soccer fans (we are home to the 2010 national champions, 2009 runners up; two years ranked number 1 team), students who enjoy small class sizes but still want to experience a large university, 85639=I am starting as a freshmen in the Fall of 2012. I have to learn more about the university in the fall., 781166=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 332261=Akron as amazing new football stadium and are men soccer time is really good. In 2010 Akron were national championships. If you want to go to sport game go to Men Soccer team. Join the Ak-Rowdies. There is lot of fun things to do at Lock 3 and Ej Thomas., 282731=I used to have the Unlimited dining plan. With Unlimited we had 1000 swipes for Rob's Cafe. But if you're really looking for something where you can have access to Subway the market and so on etc I hear the Gold Plan is just one step up from the Unlimited dining plan and you have access to many fast food restaurants., 738221=Make sure you make time to study because it will count. Always party/go out in groups at night. AND NEVER TAKE A 7:45 CLASS BECAUSE YOU WILL HATE IT.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Tips for prospective students Awesome school! I live at home and commute to and from daily. Parking can be a hassle but if you get there early it's a breeze to find a parking spot. I am definitely learning a lot in all of my classes and almost all of the professors are willing to help you out if you are struggling with anything. Highly recommend the University of Akron!
