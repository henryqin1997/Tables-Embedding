Likewise, each weight range may not be available in all colors. Therefore we ask you to list and prioritize your color preferences and to give us guidance if the color or weight range you want happens to not be available. Feel free to contact us if you need more specific info. DX discs are affordably priced and provide an excellent grip in all types of weather conditions. Over time, DX discs will take on new and varied flight characteristics that stem from their use. They start out more overstable, but with use will match the flight ratings. With continued use, they'll eventually become more understable than the ratings. It is a great choice for maximum distance, long hyzers, headwind drives, and for intermediate to advanced players looking for a stable wind fighting distance disc. 21.2 cm The Innova DX Destroyer is a distance driver that is stable to overstable. It is a very fast golf disc with significant glide. Faster than the Wraith and with a little more high and low speed stability. Can handle headwinds and throws with off axis torque. The Star Destroyer is the first Speed 12 disc Innova released. Initial reviews compared it to a faster TeeRex. A great disc for sidearm throwers and those with lots of power. Not for beginners.",
    "textAfterTable": "\"The Destroyer is a very consistent distance driver that is very overstable when new. It is easily the farthest flying disc in my bag.\" - Ricky Wysocki \"The Destroyer has been my go to driver for years. You can bomb it, and trust it.\" - Nikko Locastro If you are looking for a disc that has more Glide, try the Kite more Turn, try the Wahoo more Fade, try the XCaliber Other Speed 12 discs include the TeeDevil, Wahoo and XCaliber Write a review Rating: Bad \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Good Your Name: Your Review: Note: HTML is not translated!
