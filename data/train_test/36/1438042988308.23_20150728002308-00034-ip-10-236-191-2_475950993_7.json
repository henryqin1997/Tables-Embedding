The Exchange Rate class retains historic information since the entire transaction may not happen at the same time (e.g., items may be shipped prior to billing). For example, an exchange rate of one U.S. Dollar=1.03687 Euros on Feb. 29, 2000 would be one instance of Exchange Rate class 228., 23521=The present application claims priority from Provisional U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 60/126,364, filed on Mar. 26, 1999 and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 64759=Prices indicated in a trading partner agreement (an instance of Trading Partner Agreement class 220) may override prices from the price list. For example, XYZ Inc. has opened customer account #12345ZZZ45 (an instance of Customer Account class 204) for the ZZZ Inc. party (an instance of Party class 247). The account is associated with price list #P12345 (an instance of Price List class 229) as well as a trading partner agreement (an instance of Trading Partner Agreement class 220)., 65804=Discount class 235 indicates adjustment to prices (an instance of Price List Item class 248) of a specific product type (an instance of Product Type class 221) that is applied to the price listed in a price list (an instance of Price List class 229) if specific conditions are met. For example, if buyer XXX Inc. (an instance of Buyer class 203) orders more than 1000 items of Apache Server Handbook from XYZ Inc. then it will receive a 5% discount (a instance of Discount class 235). However, if XXX Inc. orders the same items from ZZZ Inc. then it will receive a 10% discount (another instance of Discount class 235).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the preferred embodiment and various alternative embodiments of the invention have been disclosed and described in detail herein, it may be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. VOTE and NPR may support DCE access-controls lists, which control the explicit access permissions granted to users and groups. VOTE and NPR may support many types of merchandise transfer. Under the generic term merchandise transfer, VOTE and NPR may support the aforementioned purchase request, purchase order, order confirmation, blanket purchase order and ship notification documents. VOTE and NPR may support transactions in United States dollars and local currencies. Exchange rate conversions may be supported for total landed (delivered) cost calculations and purchase orders. Multi-customer operation may be provided through implementation of customer tables pointing to the catalog inventory and transaction elements of the database. Implementing customer preferences, as may be required by trading partner agreements, enables multilevel access to seller catalog information. VOTE and NPR may support a flexible, complex inventory system capable of classifying catalog inventory items in different units. Both VOTE and NPR may use similar application server and database data models to support multilingual, multi-country and multi-customer operation. Both NPR and VOTE allow for real-time translation between languages using a combination of hard-coded translation values for standard words and reference",
