            "This school is great for students who want to combine religious learning with the rest of their education. It's a great place to feel the spirit and learn a tremendous amount. It's also a great school for those who want a closer more intimate school setting. It's a smaller school than others, but just as great.",
            "Make sure you set aside time to study. Get your homework out of the way early on so you don't have to worry about it later. I would also suggest first time students to stay in on campus housing for the first semester. It helps you to become familiar with the campus and its a great way to meet other first time students. But after that first semester, don't be afraid to venture into off campus housing. Know that you can have fun, but make sure you have a good balance between that and doing your homework and studying. Study. It really pays off in the end.",
            "This school always has something fun and interesting to look forward to during the week, and including weekends. They have ongoing sports and dances. They also have many volunteer opportunities for you to participate in.",
            "The people here are great. Everyone is really nice and very helpful. They have really fun activities; there is always something for you to do. This school knows how to have some fun, but also knows how to buckle down and be serious. There is a great balance between the two.",
            "The teachers here are amazing and really know their stuff. Because this school is a religion school, you can definitely feel the spirit and it's great because it's a constant thing. The teachers here are great at teaching, telling you what you need to know, and tying our religion into everything. It makes the classes very interesting."

LDS tuition only about 1500 a semester and 3000 for non LDS. Defiantly worth every penny. They also offer free tutoring!, 868498=BYU-Idaho provides a terrific education for the money. It's about 1800 a semester, and they usually keep textbook costs down as well. And, if you get a 4.0 during your first year, you automatically receive a scholarship for a full year's worth of tuition, which can be renewed each year after., 165275=As September nears I wait in anticipation for this great experience.Idaho, here I come!!!, 253272=tuition is $1700 per semester. it is the best value college out there., 1081602=Totally worth it. You spend around 3,000 per semester. Tuition is around 1800, room and board is around 1000; dorms and most apartments cost this price, if you are looking at a fancier apartment it can range between 1200-1500 per semester. anyway it is TOTALLY worth it., 858317=BYU-I is subsidized by money from the LDS church, which makes tuition incredibly affordable in comparison to other universities. It's currently around $3000 per semester for those who aren't members of the LDS church, and those who are members have to pay around $2000. Great professors and student body, it's a wonderful place to learn(I swear I'm not being paid by the school to write this. I just love it here.)., 47048=A great university that offers great pricing. I pay about 2000 dollars a semester for tuition. That doesnt include housing rate and college fees but overall it is the best around in regards to bang for the buck., 827640=Tuition is actually the cheapest that I have found. It is about 2000 dollars a semester and apartments cost about 1000 dollars a semester., 639146=BYU Idaho is one of the least expensive private schools in the US. Where else can you spend less than $2000 for tuition AND books a semester? I think the education is great! I think the classes are good and I have always learned a lot., 1027217=Definitely worth the money. Unless you are a D student you will get a scholarship, even if it is just $250 per semester. The bookstore, despite what some say does offer competitive pricing on books. Tuition is less that $1800 per semester and you can take as many as 21 credits, which I would recommend against. While some argue its not as good academically as Provo, it's no worse that any state college I ever went to and they are adding new programs every year., 171073=It is possible to save money while being at BYU-Idaho! The tuition is about $1600 to be a full-time student from out of state, and the off campus housing is between $875-$1100 for 4 months with utilities and cable included. Books are super cheap if you rent them and the food is reasonably priced., 166900=Bring WARM clothes, even in March it still snows and is cold, 470036=Every September there is a Temple-to-Temple relay where teams of 2-8 people run 37 miles total from the Rexburg Id. Temple to the Idaho Falls, Id. Temple. The cost is between $10 and $17 (depending on when you register) and includes snacks and a nice sports T-shirt. The sand dunes are a great place for camping, roasting hot dogs and marshmallows, or just having fun. They are about 15 miles out of town, but worth going to again and again., 393426=Every sunday at 9:00PM people will gather under the stadium and sing hymns for half an hour. It's pretty fun if you get a good group going! as for locations, There is a beautiful set of gardens nestled between the Ricks and Benson buildings. definitely check them out., 80473=every student has to sign a code of conduct before attending, saying you will uphold the standards of the church and not cheat, lie, steal, etcetera. this is a church school, so every tuesday the campus shuts down at 1:50 until 3:00 and all the students gather in the i-center to listen to a speaker who discusses some principle of the gospel. they are selected by a committee of students, supervised by the president of the college. also, this school has a testing center. you go to this room in the student center and you take your test there., 260178=i haven't ventured out since 2001 in that department., 254323=campus dining, called the crossroads is located in the center of campus. the food is delicious and has a wide variety of choices. the crossroads is open monday through saturday: 11:00 a.m. - 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m. the prices are more expensive than cooking in your apartment and average $7/meal., 650836=With tuition around $1700 and rent between $400 - $700 a month you can't ask for a better price for your education., 572830=DANCE PARTIES! There are tons of dance parties around the area where you get to dress up crazy and go have a blast with your friends. There is also good hiking, and a waterfall called Monkey Rock close by that are fun to go to. Campus has tons of activities that go on all the time. For example, Spring Semester 2012, they had Bill Cosby do a comedy show. There are lots of fun things to do in little Rexburg, Idaho! They just leave room for you to be creative. :), 945317=I suggest taking at least one course from brother Ross Barron. He is by far the best professor there. His classes are tough and very educational. There is never a dull moment. I also suggest not taking a class by Brother Hammar. He is a sweet old man- but he is forgetful and asks way too much for the credits his class is worth.}",
