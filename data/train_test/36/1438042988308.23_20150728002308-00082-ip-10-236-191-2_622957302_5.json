Second civilian (Shagari) administration period (1980-1983), 15776=1976, 23305=1645, 16665=January 1993, 95051=The quality of the housing stock in Nigeria is poor, particularly in the rural areas where the majority of the people live. Table 4 shows that there is a widespread lack of facilities in urban areas as well. Possibly the most striking issue in the table is that 20.6 per cent of all housing units in urban areas (694,000 units), and 32.1 per cent of all units in rural areas (3,803,000 units), are more than 24 years old. If all these old units are taken as a (modest) estimate of the number of units in need of replacement or upgrading, it implies that the total current housing deficit is about 5,623,000 units, of which two thirds is in rural areas. If these are to be replaced or upgraded during the 19912001 period, it implies an additional annual need of 70,000 units in urban areas and 380,000 units in rural areas. Legitimate as the need for upgrading of existing shelter stock may be, this need fades into relative insignificance compared with the immediate need for new units to satisfy the requirements of an population growth of 1.4 million people per annum., 89692=Housing stock 1991, 41959=\u2022 The Nigerian Town and Country Planning Ordinance No.4 of 1946 (Cap 155 of the Laws of Nigeria);, 28050=The Fourth National Development Plan period (1980-1985) also accepted the recognition accorded to the shelter sector during the Third Plan period. The basic policy of the Government - of massive intervention in the sector to provide large quantities of housing units with special emphasis on the low-income group - remained unaltered and was reinforced. The fourth plan came to an abrupt end in 1983 when the civilian administration was overthrown in a military coup d'etat. In 1985, the Federal Government, conscious of the inability of previous policies and programmes to deal satisfactorily with the mounting shelter problems of the country, set up a special committee, made up of representatives of relevant public-sector bodies and other non-governmental interests in the shelter sector, to analyse the past national policies and programmes and make proposals for a new national housing policy. The report of the panel formed the basis of the present National Housing Policy, which has a definite and far-reaching enabling orientation., 23443=4. Second military interregnum (1984-19931, 94919=2500 +, 69674=Nigeria should gradually and systematically develop appropriate capabilities to reduce construction costs and achieve self-sufficiency in the production of basic building-materials and components from local resources at affordable cost. The public sector has had a long-standing interest in building-materials production. Under the import-substitution policy of the first National Development Plan (1962-1968), the building-materials sub-sector was earmarked for action. Many government-sponsored building-materials factories were established at that time. Cement was the most popular of the materials in this regard, although factories for paints and roofing materials were established. The current policy of the public sector is to move away from direct production of building materials towards that of facilitation. The Government intends to expand the scale of building-materials production. To achieve this goal, the Government has decided to pursue the following strategies:, 13128=Pursuant to the Town Planning Ordinance (Cap.95), the Lagos Executive Development Board (LEDB) was created in 1928 and charged with the effective planning and development of Lagos. The creation was as a result of the bubonic plague which ravaged Lagos in the early 1920s. After 1954, and with the approval of the Lagos Central Planning Scheme, the LEDB for the first time attempted to solve the problems of public housing in Lagos. In implementing its schemes, the LEDB encountered a number of problems, one of which was that not much was achieved in regard to satisfying the housing need and demand of the inhabitants of Lagos., 94436=251-1250, 67033=Source: FRN, 1982; Onibokun (ed.),1985., 90710=Required annual output, 1991-2001, 42426=The Land Use Decree, which is a major land-reform instrument, remains a controversial law. Nevertheless, the law is so basic to the livelihood of the majority of people that it has received unusual government protection since 1979. One point, on which both defenders and opponents of the law agree, is that the machinery of land management and administration built into the law is very cumbersome and at times counterproductive., 20419=Table 2. Planned federal expenditure on housing programmes during the 4th national development plan (1980-1985), 25913=1. The data contained in this report were collected before the military coup in 1993., 14552=During this era, especially the period immediately after independence, emphasis was placed on the five-yearly Development Plans as an instrument for economic growth. In the first two plans, the housing sector was virtually neglected. Further deterioration was witnessed in the housing situation during the civil war period, especially in the war-affected areas. In 1967, more housing corporations were established in the newly created states. However, their contributions were rather insignificant. In other words, the scope of their operations were severely restricted due to lack of finance and technical personnel. Hence, these institutions served the upper-income earners only, as only relatively expensive housing estates were developed and loans were rather restricted., 17024=April 1993 (\"parallel\" marker), 16298=1986- 1988, 76271=21597, 100190=The demand for housing is a reflection of the ability of households to pay for them. Thus, an examination of household incomes and prices of housing units provides a basis for assessing housing demand. There are no current data on the distribution of household incomes in Nigeria. The most recent survey on the matter was carried out in 1984 and the result is summarized in table 12. About the same time that these data were being collected, the official definition of the low-income groups, at least as far as housing policy was concerned, included all households earning an annual income of N3000 or less. This group was estimated to account for over 70 per cent of the Nigerian population (FRN, 1985)., 39459=The main participants and programmes in the private sector are the employees' housing schemes and the insurance companies. The employees' housing schemes were established by the Special Provisions Decree No.54 of 1979 (as amended). Under this scheme staff housing estates have been developed by United African Company of Nigeria, Union Bank of Nigeria, Elf Oil Company, Shell Oil Company, Mobil Oil etc. These schemes have been operating to an appreciable degree of success within the following stipulations:, 94678=1251-2500, 18241=The first two periods and especially this third housing period, witnessed a steady increase in the interest and involvement of the public sector in shelter delivery, and the awareness of the importance of the shelter sector within the overall economy. Although some of the shelter strategies and activities during these periods may be seen to be in conformity with the enabling concept, the direct production of shelter by the public sector remained their common feature. This strategy, which is contrary to the enabling approach, witnessed huge failures during the Shagari administration, when the Federal Government of Nigeria allocated N 1.9 billion for housing construction, in all the 20 states of Nigeria, including Abuja. By June 1983, N600 million (37.5 per cent) had been spent to complete only 32,000 units, yielding an overall achievement level of just 20 per cent (FRN, 1990: 3)., 90373=Required output 1991-2001, 77876=Table 8. Percentage distribution of households, by dwelling types, Nigeria (1984-1985), 30282=To accomplish the objectives, the following strategies have been put in place (FRN, 1991 10-12):, 17419=Source: Achunine, 1993., 85407=11393, 52914=In 1983, the FMW&H requested the World Bank for assistance in finding an institutional solution to the problem. The IDF concept was proposed and accepted by the Government in June 1985. Subsequently, consultants were engaged to study the issue of the institutional location of the Fund. Their recommendation to license some of Nigeria's merchant banks to operate the fund was adopted as the institutional framework for the Fund. The Federal Government's acceptance to utilize the merchant banks in this venture is a major policy breakthrough and will facilitate private-sector participation in the financing of urban infrastructure., 86622=Source: Based on Achunine, 1993., 43574=One example of a law that is thoroughly obsolete is the Nigerian Town and Country Planning Ordinance 1946, (Cap. 155 of the Laws of Nigeria). As the basic regulatory planning mechanism, it is vital in the shelter sector because it controls the major part of the process of translating raw land into shelter and a living environment. The main criticisms of this law are that it does not offer sufficient participation by the relevant actors, it does not reflect modern land- use planning concepts, uses and practice, and it has not been synchronized with the provisions of the Land Use Decree of 1978. This necessitated the setting-up of a National Committee for its review. The final draft of a new Nigerian Town and Country Planning Law has since been submitted to the Government and it is hoped that it will soon be promulgated to assist in the implementation of the new National Housing Policy., 29319=The ultimate goal of the National Housing Policy is to ensure that all Nigerians own or have access to decent housing accommodation at affordable cost by the year 2000., 15945=1980/81, 16840=April 1993 (official), 92960=Table 11 provides an estimate of shelter needs in Nigeria for the decade 1991 to 2001. It shows that - given the estimated current housing stock, assuming an annual increase in the number of households of 5 per cent in urban areas and 2.5 per cent in rural areas, and a target of one housing unit per household in 2001 - the annual housing need between 1991 and 2001 is 392,000 units in urban areas, and 345,000 units in rural areas. The current housing deficit was above estimated to 25 per cent in urban areas, i.e., 1,126,000 units., 40722=Another arm of the private sector that has contributed to residential housing development consists of the insurance companies. This has been a result of the Decree No.59 of 1979 which made it mandatory that all insurance companies invest not more than 25 per cent of their life funds and not more than 10 per cent of its non-life funds in real estate. The provisions have since been amended by Decree No.3 (National Housing Fund Decree 1992) which states, inter alia, that, every registered insurance company shall invest a minimum of 20 per cent of its non-life funds and 40 per cent of its life funds in real property development of which not less than 50 per cent shall be paid into the fund through the FMBN. This has led to a lot of protests and the insurance community has requested further amendment of the provisions., 23514=It is perhaps somewhat premature to undertake an evaluation of the policy strategy and performance of this period because the period so far has been very much a transitional one in which the Federal Government has been preoccupied with the preparation of a new and more relevant National Housing Policy. This policy was finalized and launched by the President in February 1991. The policy has since become operational as the detailed modalities for its implementation have been put in place., 44500=As regards the enforcement of building regulations and bye-laws, the practice over the years has been for local governments, planning and development authorities to adopt these instruments for local use. A common feature of these byelaws is the very strong similarity between them and the eighteenth century building codes and standards introduced by the early colonial administrations. These building standards do not reflect contemporary socioeconomic realities, while the machinery of building approvals is unnecessarily sluggish and fraught with malpractice. The FMW&H has caused these laws to be reviewed and updated and a draft was placed before the Government in November 1991 for approval and adoption., 16472=April 1992 after deregulation), 95000=Source: Achunine, 1993, 79835=Table 8 presents the official figures from 1984-1985 on the volume of different types of dwellings in Nigeria. The reliability of these data, however, is very low. First the terminology on house types is unconventional. For example, \"single\" is used to refer to maisonettes and duplexes, and sometimes to semi-detached houses as well. Secondly, some of the figures in the table are rather unrealistic. The figures do, however, provide a rough indication of the actual distribution of dwelling units by types. The dominance of the room type of dwelling in both rural and urban areas, for instance, is made quite clear. Informative as this table may be, the contents do not portray any realism to what is on the ground. Based on concrete experience in both urban and rural areas, as well as discussions with various observers, Achunine (1993) has estimated the composition of the housing stock in Nigeria as is outlined in table 9. The table indicates that the vast majority of housing units can be classified as either rooms (74 per cent) or detached bungalows (17 per cent). ID the urban areas, however, flats are estimated to account for about 15 per cent of the total housing stock., 62950=To achieve the goals and objectives mentioned above, the Government inaugurated a committee to look into the constraints. The review has gone through many stages and was, in early 1993, at the final stage where it is being given final touches by the Law Reform Commission for promulgation., 77258=The population of Nigeria in 1991 was about 89 million (see table 6). A demographic survey conducted by the Federal Office of Statistics in 1990 showed that the overall average household size was 5.4 persons. The figures for urban and rural areas were 4.8 and 5.6 persons respectively (see table 7). The same survey estimated that 24.4 per cent of all houses in Nigeria, 23385=Source: Onibokun (Ed.), 1985., 89136=Table 11. Estimated housing needs Nigeria (1991 -2001), 77656=were located in urban areas. Based on the above figures, the total number of households in Nigeria in 1991 is estimated at 16.4 million, of which 4.5 million are urban and 11.9 million rural., 102302=The economic polices and conditions in Nigeria in the 1980s were devastating. Although, in numerical terms, household incomes have risen by a factor of about 5 since 1987, the purchasing power has declined by a factor of about 8. Thus, the average Nigerian household is worse-off today than in 1984. Based on this scenario, Achunine (1993) has estimated the income distribution in 1992 as is outlined in table 13., 16117=1982-1985 (average), 35540=\u2022 The Federal Housing Authority (FHA) was set up in 1973 to perform three principal functions, i.e., prepare proposals for national housing programmes for submission from time to time to the Federal Government; develop and manage real estates on a commercial and profitable basis throughout the Federal Republic of Nigeria; and provide sites-and-services facilities for all income groups, with special emphasis on the low-income group in the major cities., 21090=Providing 2000 housing units per state, 19161=This period coincides approximately with the Fourth National Development Plan period (see table 2). It witnessed the continued increasing deficit on urban housing as well as its continuous deterioration in the rural areas. The beneficiaries of this programme were identified as the low-income earners whose annual income did not exceed N8000. A total of 40,000 units (of which 90 per cent were to be one-bedroomed, 10 per cent three-bedroomed) were to be constructed annually throughout the country. In this way, 2000 units were to the built in each state including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. In the states, these housing units were located in their capitals and local government headquarters. This effort was implemented by the then Federal Ministry of Housing and Environment. Mid-way through the implementation, a second phase of the programme was commenced, comprising 20,000 units of two-bedroomed core houses for the low-income groups. It is pertinent to mention that this phase of the programme failed to take off in most states, and that the shelter policy, came to an abrupt end in December 1983, making way for a fresh look at the shelter sector which has culminated in the new National Housing Policy., 87612=Table 10. Housing tenure, Nigeria (1984-1985) (percentage), 77172=Source: Achunine, 1993 (citing the 1991 National Census)., 13785=Among other strategies and measures taken by the Government during the colonial period was the establishment of the Nigerian Building Society (NBS). It was set up in 1956 to provide mortgage loans and to (partially) satisfy Nigeria's housing needs. One of the functions of this Society was to encourage Nigerians to save, particularly for housing investment. The savings scheme witnessed poor response by the public. The demand for mortgage loans was heavy while the resources of the Society were sufficient to meet only a very small proportion of the demands. The loans favoured only upperand middle-class people; low-income earners did not benefit from NBS operations., 14484=2. Post-independence period (1960-1979), 17471=The Third National Development Plan period (1975-1980) introduced the most comprehensive and active intervention by the Government in the housing sector. The plan clearly recognized the housing problems and aimed to increase the supply of housing to a substantial level. The Federal Government decided to participate directly in the provision of housing, rather than leaving it principally to the private sector. A total of N2.6 billion (US $3 billion) was earmarked for the implementation of the various projects during the Fourth National Development Plan period. This represented about 5.6 per cent of the planned total expenditure in all sectors., 91038=Source: Based on Achunine, 1993, 102744=Housing prices vary considerably from one part of Nigeria to another, and from one city to the next. The 1992 situation in Owerri, the capital city of Imo State, a medium-size city, is shown in table 14. Table 15 indicates the average household incomes available for housing (assumed to be 25 per cent of monthly income) and the dwelling type options open to each income group. The table clearly shows that the household incomes of the lowest-income group are too low to allow them to exercise any effective demand in the open market for formal housing. These households cannot afford any form of formal housing without subsidies. This leaves a balance of 70 per cent of households with sufficient income capacity to demand some form of housing in the market. Given an estimated 17 million households in 1992 and an annual growth rate of 2.5 Her cent. the expected number of households in 1997 would be 19.2 million. This means that over the next five years there would be a total demand in the formal housing market for 2.2 million units or 440,000 units per year most of which would be single rooms and one-bedroomed flats., 17230=1 May 1993 (\"parallel\" market), 51075=Source: The Guardian, 8 January, 1990., 90024=Estimated number of households 2001, 92576=Source: FOS, 1986.}",
