            "Description",
            "In-vivo information acquiring system - An in-vivo observation system provided with a capsule endoscope including an in-vivo observation section, a battery, a magnetic field detection section, a power supply switch that controls a power supply and a power supply control section that causes the power supply switch to operate according to an internal signal from the magnetic field detection section, and a magnetic field generating apparatus including a magnetic field generating section, an operation section that outputs an operation signal according to an operation by a user and a masking section that masks an operation signal inputted to the magnetic field generating section for a predetermined period.",
            "IN-VIVO INFORMATION ACQUIRING SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING IN-VIVO INFORMATION ACQUIRING SYSTEM - A capsule endoscope system provided with a magnetic field generating apparatus including an input section for inputting identification information A and a magnetic field generating section that generates a magnetic field signal that controls a capsule endoscope, and the capsule endoscope including an in-vivo information acquiring section, a battery, a magnetic field receiving section, a storage section that stores identification information B, a control section and a comparing section that compares the identification information A with the identification information B and judges whether both pieces of information are the same or different, wherein when the judgment by the comparing section is a judgment that both pieces of information are the same, the control section supplies or shuts off power from the battery to the in-vivo information acquiring section.",
            "POWER TRANSMISSION SYSTEM - A power transmission system for supplying energy to a device operating on electrical energy taken by a power receiving antenna includes a driving unit supplied with electric power from a power supply and generating an AC current and a power transmission antenna receiving the AC current from the driving unit and generating an electromagnetic field. The power transmission antenna includes a resonance frequency adjusting circuit adjusting and setting a resonance frequency.",
            "WIRELESS-TYPE SUBJECT IN-VIVO INFORMATION ACQUIRING APPARATUS - Provided is a wireless-type subject in-vivo information acquiring apparatus that is introduced into a body cavity of an individual to be examined and acquires subject in-vivo information, and that includes a transmission antenna that has an antenna orientation direction in which a transmission signal that transmits acquired subject in-vivo information is emitted most strongly, and another antenna that has an antenna directivity in a predetermined direction that is different from that of the transmission antenna. The transmission antenna and the other antenna are arranged so that a relationship between the antenna orientation direction of the transmission antenna and the antenna orientation direction of the other antenna is a twisted positional relationship or an intersecting relationship.",
            "WIRELESS POWER SUPPLY APPARATUS, POWER TRANSMISSION COIL UNIT, AND WIRELESS POWER SUPPLY SYSTEM - A wireless power supply apparatus for a capsule-type endoscope has three sets of coils that generate a magnetic field in directions that are orthogonal to each other, a gravity sensor that detects a gravitational direction, a coil selection section that selects a coil that generates a magnetic field in a gravitational direction that is detected by the gravity sensor, and a drive section that applies a current to the coil that the coil selection section selects.",
            "CAPSULE-TYPE MEDICAL DEVICE, POWER SUPPLY APPARATUS, AND POWER SUPPLY SYSTEM - Provided is a capsule-type endoscope that has a power receiving coil that wirelessly receives an electric power from outside a body of an individual to be examined, a processing circuit that performs predetermined processing, and an adjusting reactance section that is capable of adjusting a reactance that is connected to the power receiving coil.",
            "IN VIVO INFORMATION ACQUIRING APPARATUS - A capsule endoscope includes, inside a capsule casing, an information acquiring section that acquires information on an inside of a body of a subject, a battery that supplies power, a detection section that, upon detection of introduction to the inside of the body of the subject, outputs a detection signal, a signal receiving section that receives a control signal from an outside and outputs an internal signal, and a control section that controls power supply from the battery to the information acquiring section according to the internal signal and the detection signal."
