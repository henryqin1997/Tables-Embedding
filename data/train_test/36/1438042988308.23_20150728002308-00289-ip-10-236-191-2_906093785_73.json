            "I always feel safe on campus and comfortable walking at night. There are always on campus officers and panic buttons are placed throughout campus that one could press if there was an emergency.",
            "Since I'm still in high school I didn't rush but I plan on rushing my fall semester. I haven't talked to many sorority girls; however some have approached me and are very nice.",
            "I get emailed every week on a list of activities that are happening on campus that week. This includes public speakers to simple social gatherings. Eastern has a new building, the Center for the Arts; which hosts major events and is great for the culture in the city of Richmond.",
            "EKU is a diverse campus and is great for people seeking a higher level of education. EKU also has an amazing nursing program, so nursing students should definitely look into the program.",
            "There is a statue of Daniel Boone, students kiss his golden toe for good luck before games, exams, etc.",
            "EKU is an underrated school with great programs and a decent tuition.",
            "EKU has a beautiful campus with rich history, but has modern twists. In Downstairs Powell, if you want to chill or be productive there is a room called Tech Commons. It has EKU Gurus (free tutoring), Hulu on a projector, couches, free popcorn, computers, printers, group monitors, and even comfortable seating. Noel Studio in the Crabbe library is brand new with new technology and helpful resources, yet with a fun, colorful, contemporary environment.",
            "Eastern has a good selection of easily accessible dining options. Downstairs Powell has a couple chain restaurants (that are open till 2 A.M.) and a tiny shop (that is overpriced). Upstairs Powell has a buffet with plenty of choices for diners.",
            "I don't live in a dorm, because I'm still in high school. Though, my brother does dorm in Martin Hall. It isn't the best quality-wise, but he says he doesn't mind it. I hear a lot of stories about different dorms on campus that have problems down to water temperature in the showers. EKU is building new dorms by the New Science Building; however, to my conclusion, the current buildings are out of date.",
            "I have had to develop study habits more than my honors courses at my high school. I spend at least 5 hours a week in the library, but I have maintained higher than a 3.6 at Eastern; however, it does take effort.",
            "Always go to class, even if it's a lecture and they don't take attendance. Make sure you a prepared and organized. Go to the library, it's a great place to stay focused and remove yourself from distractions. Before classes start, go to your buildings and walk the route you are going to take to make sure you have enough time to get to class on time.",
            "I am a full-time student at Eastern and a senior and Madison Central High School; Eastern is an underrated school and the campus is beautiful. I feel safe on campus and comfortable walking to my classes. Eastern is the perfect size for me and I plan on attending here for the remainder of my college career."

I have completed a lot of my classes and have gotten extra certifications that I wouldn't have been able to at other schools and I feel that I am actually prepared for my career., 339489=I started here at EKU in Fall of 2013. I love the campus size, classroom sizes, teachers, and most importantly the students here as well. There will always be something to do on and off campus. You're not far from Lexington and Louisville, either. Everyone on campus is here to make sure you become successful. I plan on graduating from here. #ColonelPride, 108227=If you are looking to major in Education then EKU is the school for you. The major courses there are specifically designed to make you feel confident in all content areas. I am set to graduate in December of this year and I feel very satisfied with the education I have recieved.}",
