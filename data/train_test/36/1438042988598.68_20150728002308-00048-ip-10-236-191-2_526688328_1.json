Therefore, it is rather fitting that when Fuji was founded in 1899 , it was named after Mount Fuji, a Japanese symbol of strength and endurance, and one of the most iconic and Majestic mountain peaks in the world. With that said, Fuji is a brand that believes in the core characteristics in which cycling represents; strength, endurance, challenge, and triumph. The same can be said about their bikes., 159625=The 2012 Fuji Tahoe 29 2.0 is an Aluminum Hardtail 29er with a ton of capabilities. If you are seeking a bike that can perform, but don\u2019t want to break the bank, this fierce and responsive bike is certainly worth a look. The riding trend of Hardtail 29ers is a forced to be reckoned with, as it has become the industry standard for racing and performance mountain bikes. The large 29 inch wheels make quick work of nearly any terrain. The hard tail frame makes the bike quick and snappy. This is a huge plus because large wheels normally make you less responsive but that\u2019s not the case with this hardtail 29er.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "2012 Fuji Tahoe 29 2.0 Components It is no secret that Shimano is one of the top dogs in the drivetrain business, so it makes perfect sense that Fuji would go to great lengths to ensure that this build was outfitted with industry leading components. The Shimano M552 Hollow Tech triple crankset provides essential power transfer capacities, as well as giving the rider more gear options for adapting to indecisive terrain. Shimano SLX rapid fire shifters direct the rear Shimano Deore XT derailleur and Shimano SLX front derailleur smoothly and efficiently. The Tektro Auriga Pro hydraulic disc brakes allow you to stop on a dime. This 29 inch Hardtail is well suited, smooth rolling and able to power through the trail with ease. You can\u2019t go wrong here! Fuji has graced the Tahoe 29 2.0 with the quality component group that has been selected. The RockShox Recon Silver fork has 100mm of travel featuring a tapered alloy steerer that adds to the stiff properties. In addition, the Rock Recon Silver includes the PopLoc remote lockout feature so that with a flick of a switch, you can lock out your fork and make further adjustments as you wish. This makes it easy to lock out your suspension in an instant with the use of a remote lever on your handlebar. The Frame is constructed from A2-SL super light aluminum alloy, and features a hydroformed top tube which trims off additional weight. A tapered headtube is used to add to the stiffness,",
