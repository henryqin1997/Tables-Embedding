But he also faced a big budget deficit when he took office in 2003, so he raised revenue as well., 43672=Romney's plan is intended to be revenue-neutral, but it's impossible to confirm that unless he releases details on how he would curb tax breaks. As is, the plan would reduce federal revenue by an estimated $480 billion in 2015 relative to where rates are today, according to an analysis by the independent Tax Policy Center., 83200=Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Nor did they go down, however. Romney had proposed a lower personal income tax rate in 2006, although he didn't specify how to pay for the revenue loss. And in any case the state legislature did not approve Romney's proposal, Widmer said.}",
