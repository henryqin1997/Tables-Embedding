            "being that lake state is a huge criminal justice and emergency response school, there is always some sort of campus police or security guards walking around, which makes the campus really safe.",
            "one unusual tradition that Lake State has is that at the end of winter the student body holds its annual snowman burning!",
            "theres a lot to do in the Soo, if you enjoy the outdoors. a lot of hunting and fishing can be done, hiking and camping, and being so close to the border you can go to canada and go to the mall. if you are at least 21 there is also a large number of bars within walking distance of the campus. and of course being in the upper peninsula of michigan hockey is Huge! there is a number of games you can go watch ranging from the college team to the OHL, and junior hockey!",
            "I really enjoyed the dinning hall and the gallery, they broth provide good food with multiple options everyday, only bad thing is that they do not allow you to bring food back to your room you have to eat in the cafeteria.",
            "I lived in Brady hall with 3 other roommates. The dorm was old and had community bathrooms, but the rooms were medium size and set up well. The dorm also provides a student lounge, laundry, and study rooms in the basement that really comes in handy on those cold nights!",
            "The education is like any small university, it is challenging work but the school provides many opportunities for the student to go in and receive help or to ask questions on certain topics.",
            "The professors at lake state are very nice and are willing to do anything to help a student, do not be afraid to make your self close to your professors, it will not only help you but they also enjoy it! Be prepared to stay inside and study a lot! the winter starts early and ends late so walking to and from class is a cold one. also learn to like hockey!",
            "Lake Superior State was a great atmosphere for one who is looking to excel in and out side of the classroom. The school is very small and personal, its very easy to get around. the only bad thing is the cold weather!"
