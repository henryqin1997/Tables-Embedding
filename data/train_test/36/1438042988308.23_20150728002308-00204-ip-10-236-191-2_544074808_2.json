This information is available in any good encyclopedia. Here's what the Encyclopedia Britannica from 1957 has to say about these Christmas customs:, 41993=Why she doesn't ignore this fellow and be on her way she'll never know, but she snaps back, \"Listen, don't you go to church?! Didn't you ever read the Bible? Christmas is Jesus' birthday! December the 25th. That's when we celebrate the birth of Christ.\", 17445=How did these pagan customs become part of Christendom's religions? Well in the fourth century Christianity had become a victim of the wolves that were prophesied at Acts 20:29, 30. Here Paul warned, \"I know that after my going away oppressive wolves will enter in among YOU and will not treat the flock with tenderness, and from among YOU yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves.\", 1469=Can we possibly observe Christmas in a non-religious way? You could reason, \"I don't believe in all that stuff!\" but you go ahead and do it anyway. Well if we want to be guided by the Bible let's turn to 1 Corinthians 10:21. These are God's feelings about it. \"YOU cannot be drinking the cup of Jehovah and the cup of demons; YOU cannot be partaking of \"the table of Jehovah\" and the table of demons.\" Turn over to 2 Corinthians 6:4-18 and we'll include excerpts (but feel free the read it in its entirety). There it tells us, \"Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers. For what fellowship \ufffd does light have with darkness? \ufffd what agreement does God's temple have with idols? \"'Therefore get out from among them, and separate yourselves,' says Jehovah, 'and quit touching the unclean thing'\"\ufffd \"'And I shall be a father to YOU, and YOU will be sons and daughters to me,' says Jehovah the Almighty.\", 8932=Tradition tells us that an evergreen tree appeared on the grave on Nimrod to symbolize that he did not really die but, as an immortal god, he had triumphed over death. There after the evergreen tree became part of the December pagan festival. In Egypt, where the pine tree was not available, the green branches of the palm were used (Fig. 6). In India they made an imitation out of straw, wrapped with rope, plastered with mud into which they stuck oleander twigs. They just had to have their tree. The pagan Romans likewise decorated their homes with green bows, but they also only added apples and other pagan associations. The holly was considered sacred by pagan sun worshippers. The ivy in ancient times was associated with feasts held in honor of Bacchus the god of wine (Fig. 7). The mistletoe, according to pagan druidic superstitious, was regarded as a divine branch that had come from heaven and represented their messiah. The kissing under the mistletoe was part of the mystic rights at the time of the winter solstice. The Encyclopedia Americana says, \"The holly and the mistletoe are relics of pre-Christian times.\", 4170=How could this world wide pagan celebration, supposedly in honor in Jesus Christ, possibly gained such an acceptance by the religions of Christendom? Perhaps the Bible can help us to understand this. Do you believe what the Bible tells us at 2 Corinthians 11:14, 15 that Satan can appear as an angel of light and fool even perhaps the elect if it were possible? Do you believe what was written at 1 John 5:19, which reads \"the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one\"? Do you believe 2 Corinthians 4:4 which tells us Satan is \"the god of this system of things\" and he is preventing many from understanding the good news about the Christ by keeping them blinded so that they can't know the truth? Sometimes it's difficult for people to break off old habits. Even though some religious people know the truth about Christmas customs and how it has been so commercialized say, as many clergyman have, \"Let's put Christ back into Christmas!\" Have you ever heard that?, 13439=Now that this is true of Christmas is admitted by Catholic authorities. The Catholic Encyclopedia says, \"The well known Feast of Natalis Invicti, birthday of the unconquered, celebrated on the 25th of December has a strong claim on the responsibility for our December date.\" that is dating the birth of Christ on December 25th. Furthermore the Catholic Encyclopedia says, \"Christmas was not among the earliest festivals of the church.\", 10612=Now listen to what a man, who modestly admits he has been a student of the Bible for sixty years, had to say on the subject in a letter to the editor of the Sacramento Bee. The context is someone had included the tenth chapter of Jeremiah in a previously written reply to the Christmas tree, and his letter was in reply to that: \"Editor of the Bee, Sir: As a sixty year student of the Bible I would like to say no Christmas tree can antedate Christ.\" Well that's quite a profound statement is it not? He goes on write, \"the babe born in the manger, who later suffered and died on the cross for our sins, brought us our first Christmas. He was nailed to a tree and because of that tree we decorate trees in remembrance of him. In so doing we prove to the world that we're believers in him. I would suggest everyone have a tree if possible and put a cross on it in remembrance of Christ.\" Signed Henry C. It took Henry sixty years to learn that bit of wisdom. He should have read Proverbs 17:28 before ever writing his letter. It reads: \"Even anyone foolish, when keeping silent, will be regarded as wise.\" But I tell you this to show you what a fine example of religious nonsense that people insist on believing during Christmas., 22466=Nimrod came to be worshiped as a messiah, a divine son of heaven. Think how well he could fit in, he and his mother, into the prophecy of Genesis 3:15, which they knew about, were acquainted with, and perhaps wondered as the fulfillment. Genesis 3:15 says the seed of God's woman would destroy the serpent (Fig. 2.) or the enemy of the people. Yes, he became their protector. People believed that life and immortality proceeded from Nimrod., 12954=Now this is interesting. After the Roman Catholic Church began to celebrate on December 25th, what they call the Mass of Christ, the Christ Mass, or Christmas, the Assyrian and Armenia Catholics accused the Roman Catholics of sun worship and idolatry. When confronted with these facts the clergy take the position of that expressed by James M. Gillis, editor of the Catholic World (December 2, 1945), who makes this candid confession: \"It is a well-known fact that the popes and councils in the early Church deliberately placed a Christian festival on or near the day of a previously existing pagan carnival,\" For what reason? \"...with the purpose of ousting the heathenish and generally licentious celebration.\" You wonder why they didn't believe the instruction given by their own Bible, which they had and they could read, in Deuteronomy 12:30-32., 19021=Nimrod worship was especially worshiped during the time of the winter solstice, or the time of the year when the sun is farthest from the celestial equator. It is the shortest day of the year, usually around the 22nd of December. The sun gradually becomes weaker, the days become shorter. The sun was dying according to pagan beliefs. Right after the shortest day the days become longer and the sun becomes stronger and warmer. Pagans believe that the sun was reborn. Because they worshipped the sun as a source of life and because the sun was returning they celebrated the occasion with much joy. In pagan Rome this celebration was known as the Saturnalia or the Feast of Saturn (Fig. 4.). Saturn was the Roman god of seed time and harvest. He surely needed the sun to make things grow. So combined with Saturn's feast was the worship of the Roman sun god Mithras. The celebration was also called the Feast of Natalis Invicti which means \"birthday of the unconquered\"., 2757=If we are Christian and we put Jehovah's worship ahead of everything else then we should want to protect our children from false worship. Their everlasting life is worth more than sentimental Christmas celebrating. Gifts are fine to give and receive, and gifts should be given to the children, but why wait until Christmas to make it appear to them as though it is a Christmas gift? What is the greatest gift you could give to your child or receive for yourself? Romans 6:23 reads \"the gift God gives is everlasting life.\" John 17:3 reads: \"This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.\" Isn't this the kind of gift your child deserves? Can they get this gift for Christmas? So parents help your children. Using the Bible explain to them about Christmas. You can strengthen and fortify them so that they can face that world outside confident that they are doing the right thing. Jesus himself made an apt illustration. You'll find it at Matthew 7:9,10. \"Indeed,\" said Jesus. \"\ufffdwho is the man among YOU whom his son asks for bread - he will not hand him a stone, will he? Or, perhaps, he will ask for a fish - he will not hand him a serpent, will he?\", 41556=\"There must be some mistake,\" replies Jesus. \"Don't you know the savior was not born on December the 25th?\", 25210=Look at that billboard. That pretty girl is saying, \"For a Merry Christmas drink Hennessy Whiskey.\" And a lot of people get taken in by this one: \"Make Christmas Merry and Easy. Borrow Money from the Friendly Finance Company. No payments until February.\" And another one: \"Give the one you love lifeless cigarettes.\" Of course the sex angle has worked to advantage as usual. A perfume ad catches your eye. A sensuous woman is suggesting that her boyfriend would make them both happy if he would give her a bottle of intimate perfume for Christmas.}",

As you do ask yourself \"what would Jesus really say about Christmas?\" Can we possibly observe Christmas in a non-religious way?
