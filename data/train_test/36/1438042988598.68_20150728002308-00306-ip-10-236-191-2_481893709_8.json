No. 09/430,209 filed on Oct. 29, 1999, which is incorporated herein by reference., 98629=[0123] The highest dose of methylphenidate produced, on average, a 5.1% increase in T2-RT in the ADHD children who were objectively hyperactive, and a 3.9% reduction in T2-RT in the three ADHD children who were not. While the percentage changes may appear to be small, they are quite strong and correspond to an effect size (Cohen d) of 2.13 (95% CI, 0.82-3.44) in the hyperactive subjects. An independent measures form of Cohen's d was used to calculate effect sizes. Sample sizes were then incorporated into confidence intervals using 95% limits\ufffdthe standard deviation calculated using the method given by Hedges and Olkin (1985, p. 86) Statistical Methods for Meta-Analysis. New York: Academic Press, for the medication-induced changes in T2-RT., 65355=[0068] The DART technique is described in Decoupled, Automated Rotational and Translational Registration for Functional MRI Time Series Data; The DART Registration Algorithm, Magnetic Resonance in Medicine 1997; 37:131-139 and is also described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,850,486 issued Dec. 15, 1998 assigned to the assignee of the present invention. Both of the aforementioned references are hereby incorporated by reference. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate of course that other conventional image registration techniques can also be used.}",

Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited by what has been particularly shown and described, except as indicated by the appended claims. All publications and references cited herein are expressly incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. [0130] Various modifications to the above-described treatment will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, including, for example, drug dose changes, dose administration times, testing times, and the like. [0129] In step 210, changes in the brain T2 RT at each dose from the baseline T2 RT can be plotted against the objective immobility duration test at baseline. In step 212, the dose having the largest positive percent change in T2 from the baseline can be selected for optimal treatment of the patient. [0128] In step 204, an fMRI is performed to obtain a baseline brain T2-RT, which is described in detail above. A predetermined drug dose is then administered to the patient at scheduled times in step 206. In one particular embodiment, methylphenidate is administered in doses of 0.5, 0.8, or 1.5 mg/kg per day in two divided doses for a week. In step 208, an fMRI is performed on the patient to determined a brain T2-RT and immobility duration is evaluated at",
