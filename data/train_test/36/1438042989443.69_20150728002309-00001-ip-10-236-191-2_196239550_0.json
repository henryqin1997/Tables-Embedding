Maybe. \u00a0If we do, though, it will likely be automated based on set criteria. \u00a0A career fantasy valuable cutoff of $200 (only including $0+ seasons) would lead to a similar # of hitters vs pitchers (about 150 to 60) that are currently found in the HOF. \u00a0The only exception I can see right now is to discount Saves/Reliever $ for pre-1947 pitchers as certain pitchers\u2019 career values (Waite Hoyt, Charlie Root, Chief Bender) seem inflated., 110388=Rudy Gamble says: November 17, 2013 at 9:04 pm (link), 39210=\u00a0The first notable trend break is in 1921. \u00a0From 1903-1920, only 33 pitchers ever qualified based on the aforementioned \u2018reliever\u2019 definition with no more than 7 in a single year (1917) . \u00a0In 1921, 14 pitchers qualified as relievers and this number only dipped below 10 twice since 1921 (1922, 1927). \u00a0In addition, ace relievers started to appear in the roaring 20\u2019s like the immortal Firpo Marberry and Wilcy Moore (who was the second most valuable pitcher on the 1927 Yankees)., 36541=Twenty-six hitters between 1906 and 1931 hit the max in HRs Point Shares (Babe Ruth 10 of those times) and 4 hit the max in SB Point Shares (Maury Wills in 1962/1965, Lou Brock in 1974, Henderson in 1982). \u00a0No batter comes remotely close to reaching the maximum in Runs, RBIs, or AVG since it is unrealistic for any player to be multiples ahead of the average player\u2019s stats in these categories., 34842=How do you account for hitting changes per era \u2013 e.g., low HRs/high SBs in early 1900\u2019s, power spikes in the 1930\u2019s and steroid era, etc. All player seasons are compared to the average stats of that specific season. \u00a0So Albert Belle\u2019s 50 HRs in 1995 (when the average rostered hitter hit 18 HR) is worth more than Sammy Sosa\u2019s in 2000 \u00a0(when the average rostered hitter hit 23 HRs). \u00a0Maury Wills\u2019 104 SBs in 1962 (when the average rostered hitter had 8.4 SB) is worth more than Rickey Henderson\u2019s 100 in 1980 (when the averaged rostered hitter had 16.8 SB)., 92162=The ERA/WHIP contributions \u2013 which involve subtracting the average pitcher\u2019s IP and ER from a modeled team average and swapping in Pedro\u2019s \u2013 result in Point Share contributions of 2.6 ($9.4) and 3.2 ($10.9) respectively. \u00a0These don\u2019t come close to his K value even though they are amazing ratios AND in a year where offense was high. \u00a0The only recent pitching year that approaches his great (but not unprecedented) 1999 K contribution was Pedro\u2019s 2000 when he had a 0.74 WHIP ($15.1)., 89051=Point Shares uses a fixed percentage per category to model the expected distribution in a given category using the compiled positional average as the midpoint. \u00a0This category distribution percentage has been tested against our commenter league final standings over the past couple years. \u00a0It would be difficult to impossible to prove these distributions hold true going back to 1903 so I am enlisting faith and/or willful ignorance on this topic., 95529=There are three reasons for this: \u00a01) OBP isn\u2019t factored into these values, 2) Lack of SBs \u2013 Bonds stole 13 bases which only netted $1.7. \u00a0He had $10.1 from his 52 SBs in 1990 and $4.7 from his 29 SBs in 1993. \u00a0Bobby had $11.1 from his 46 SBs in 1973 and 3) 2001 was a ridunkulous offensive year so the value of his stats is muted \u2013 in fact, anything short of 73 HRs (which netted $17 which is the highest since 1990) would have dropped him behind Sammy Sosa (146/60/160/0/.328) and Alex Rodriguez (133/52/135/18/.318 at SS)., 122899=Copyright 2007 - 2015 Razzball LLC.

There is no direct method right now to see all of a player\u2019s seasons. \u00a0For those in the\u00a0Hall of Fame/Hall of Merit, you can see all player seasons on their respective links (just filter the name). \u00a0 The \u2018best season by decade\u2019 charts will have at least all the $0+ seasons for players. \u00a0For hitters, there is a 300 plate appearance minimum (200 for 1981 and 1994). \u00a0For pitchers, most SP seasons of $0+ will be at least 100 IP., 101042=Rudy Gamble says: November 5, 2013 at 9:19 am (link), 105585=Rudy Gamble says: November 5, 2013 at 3:18 pm (link), 90662=The average rostered SP in 1999 had a line of: \u00a0205.3 IP/13.6 Wins/0 SV/4.181 ERA/1.359 WHIP/150.6 Ks, 96795=Use of the statistics Can I display/source this data on my website/blog? \u00a0Yes, we encourage you to reference all of these stats for articles, quizzes, etc. \u00a0We just ask that: 1) You note it\u2019s from Razzball, 2) Link to us, and 3) Do not copy/paste a big chunk of the stats on your site (i.e., showing a top 20 for a year or all the seasons for a single player is okay. \u00a0showing every single player season for 1996 is not). \u00a0If you run a baseball statistics site and are interested in integrating this into your player data, please e-mail rudy@razzball.com with your proposal., 37458=K\u2019s \u2013 2 times (Dazzy Vance \u2013 1924, Bob Feller \u2013 1946) Saves \u2013 4 times (Joe McGinnity \u2013 1904, Claude Elliott \u2013 1905, Firpo Marberry \u2013 1926, Joe Page \u2013 1949), 35500=While this takes care of the vast majority of cases, there are a handful of instances with HR/SB where players are so far ahead of the pack that a cap is necessary to avoid overcrediting a player. \u00a0Because no matter how much a player contributes in a category (say if Billy Hamilton steals 150 SB in 2014), he can only net you 12 points in SB (in a 12 team league). \u00a0This cap has been set at 2/3 the number of fantasy teams which is higher than Point Shares should conceptually credit (since the comparison is the impact on the \u2018average\u2019 team, the max points should be at 5.5 points for a 12 team league \u2013 calculated as 12 being the category max and 6.5 being the average team\u2019s points in a category) but lower than the absolute maximum which would be 11 points in a 12-team league (going from worst to first). \u00a0This concession was made to make sure that in, say, 1927 that Babe Ruth\u2019s 60 HRs would receive more Point Shares than Hack Wilson\u2019s 30., 33772=Position eligibility for pitchers is more subjective given the shifting roles of relievers over the years. \u00a0In general, any pitcher whose GS represent 50+% of Games is noted as a SP as well as any pitchers with 20+ GS. \u00a0All pitchers prior to 1921 are noted as \u2018SP\u2019 since the role of Relief Pitcher was not fully established yet., 99820=Gregorius Chant says: November 5, 2013 at 9:01 am (link), 25293=What is the Historical Fantasy Baseball Player Rater? A trivial exercise to determine the fantasy baseball dollar value for every player season since 1903., 32009=When comparing against multiple years, however, the challenge is that a Point Share is not a common metric because it is scaled to the number of MLB teams. \u00a0A Point Share when MLB has 16 teams (1903-1960) is worth almost 2x the value of a Point Share when there are 30 teams. \u00a0Since the $ budget stays constant at $260/team, the $ translations of each category serve as a better reporting metric across multiple years., 90470=Let\u2019s use Pedro Martinez\u2019s amazing 1999 as an example when he had 213.3 IP/23 Wins/0 SV/2.07 ERA/0.92 WHIP/313 K\u2019s., 86641=What are the biggest differences between the Razzball fantasy baseball awards (MVFH \u2013 Most Valuable Fantasy Hitter, FantCy \u2013 Fantasy Cy Young, and Rotoids Relief Pitcher) vs. the real awards (MVP, Cy Young, Rolaids Relief Pitcher)? For hitters, the MVFH places a MUCH greater value on SBs (e.g., 2013 Miguel Cabrera is the first MVFH season since 2004 with less than 16 SB). \u00a0MVP voting and MVFH probably value HRs and AVG about equal with MVP voting giving more weight to RBI than MVFH., 61717=How do you account for the fact that baseball was not integrated until 1947, Hispanic participation has skyrocketed in the past decades, Asian participation, \u00a0etc? The lack of African-Americans in 1903-1946 is accounted for by taking Negro League data and using a translation process to convert that into expected MLB performance while at the same time adjusting Caucasian performance down to account for increased competition. \u00a0Hispanic and Asian participation were modeled using Census figures and current rates of Major Leaguers as a percentage of those country\u2019s populations. \u00a0Satchel Paige\u2019s 1945 is the top ranked\u2026., 92953=Why do most SPs get about $2 for Saves when they don\u2019t have any Saves? (Note: \u00a0Fixed for 2014 \u2013 will be addressed soon for past months) There are two factors here. \u00a0The first is that the Point Shares for Save are calculated based 100% against positional average \u2013 e.g, SPs against SPs, RPs against RPs. \u00a0This is done because the current model estimates about 6 SP and 3 relievers per team for a 12-team league. \u00a0With this average mix, there should not be anything more than fluke saves left in free agency. \u00a0In essence, there is no opportunity cost for Saves if every closer is already owned. \u00a0Since SPs no longer get any Saves, the average for the position is typically zero and every SP gets 0.0 Point Shares. \u00a0If one was to create a position agnostic rater of pitchers, it would penalize SPs for their lack of Saves but would also boost their Wins/K\u2019s and multiply their ERA/WHIP contributions (for the better or worse)., 91010=A Point Share for SP Wins and Strikeouts in 1999 was 4.3 and 41.66 respectively. \u00a0Subtracting his totals vs. these averages (plus, some adjustment for relievers which will funk up your math so take my word on this) and you end up with 3 Point Shares in Wins ($10.5) and 4.9 in K\u2019s ($15.7). \u00a0In other words, if you swapped Pedro in for an average SP like Jeff Weaver, you are going to gain nearly 8 points in the standings on Wins and K\u2019s alone. \u00a0The reason K\u2019s are higher (and have the potential to be higher) is that there\u2019s a general ceiling on the number of Wins a pitcher can get in a year (only 4 pitchers have more than 23 wins in a season since 1991 with the highest being Justin Verlander\u2019s 26 in 2011). \u00a0Strikeouts, however, have less of a ceiling and an amazing pitcher like Pedro or Randy can run laps around other pitchers even within the constraints of the 5-man rotation. \u00a0Pedro would have needed about 31 Wins in 1999 to get the same number of Point Shares he earned in K\u2019s., 87496=For relief pitchers, the Rotoids Relief Pitcher award probably focuses a bit less on Saves vs. the other 4 stats. \u00a0A clear example of this is in 2012 when Jim Johnson won the AL Rolaids Relief Pitcher award but the fantasy $ awarded Fernando Rodney\u2019s 2/48/0.60/0.78/76 with $21.5 and Jim Johnson\u2019s 2/51/2.49/1.02/41 a $14.8. \u00a0Johnson\u2019s $1 advantage in Saves were negated by $2+ dollar differences in ERA/WHIP/K\u2019s., 82520=By using \u2018average\u2019 instead of \u2018replacement\u2019, we can see that the average SBs per rostered hitter for 1980 \u00a0(16.8) is considerably higher than 2013 (10.8) and can better estimate the impact Billy North\u2019s 45 SBs will have in the Roto Standings., 108963=Rudy Gamble says: November 17, 2013 at 9:01 pm (link), 81888=The HRs vary from 1 to 19 and the SBs vary from 0 to 45. \u00a0So let\u2019s say you average a number of them together to create a composite \u2018replacement player\u2019. \u00a0This composite average for SB will vary greatly depending upon the inclusion/exclusion of Billy North and Rudy Law. \u00a0An additional flaw is that any replacement average fails to consider the SBs for all the rostered OFs. \u00a0Billy North\u2019s 45 SBs look great from the POV of 2013 but their impact would have been blunted in 1980 by other teams having Rickey Henderson (100), Ron LeFlore (97), Omar Moreno (96), Willie Wilson and Dave Collins (79) ., 102479=Gregorius Chant says: November 5, 2013 at 2:36 pm (link), 55974=The second notable trend break for this exercise is the jump in closers starting in 1963. \u00a0The number of pitchers with 10+ SVs jumped to 24 in 1963 after slowly climbing from 10 in 1958, 11 in 1959, 14 in 1960, and 16 in both 1961 and 1962. \u00a0While these increases are somewhat driven by expansion (16 teams prior to 1961, 18 in 1961, 20 in 1962-1963), 1963 marked the first year where the number of pitchers with 10+ SV is higher than the number of MLB teams. \u00a0This ratio of pitchers with 10+ SVs and MLB teams stays relatively constant for the next 50 years while reliever usage skyrockets., 95164=How could Barry Bonds 2001 (129/73/137/13/.328) not be rated higher? Bonds\u2019 $41.6, while the best for 2001, is not only a few dollars shy of being in the top 20 of modern times (from 1947) but it is only the 4th best amongst Bonds\u2019s (Barry\u2019s \u00a01990 and 1993, Bobby\u2019s 1973)., 25487=Why would you take on this trivial exercise? 1) I like the history of baseball, baseball statistics, and fantasy baseball 2) The methodology was pretty much all in place for our Fantasy Baseball Player Rater\u00a0(where we produce Pre-Season, Season to Date, and Rest of Season Player Rater values updated daily during the season) 3) To add perspective to current day performance (e.g., how (un)precedented is Miguel Cabrera\u2019s 2012/2013, where did Chris Davis\u2019s HR total rank all-time for fantasy value?) 4) A bigger data set to test future methodological changes. 5) A blow against constipation and stoicism (i.e, for shits and giggles), 62382=Oh wait, I didn\u2019t do any of that. \u00a0I wish I could wipe away the racial injustice of the past and retro-speed up globalization but that would require some quantum leaps (and I\u2019m no Sam Beckett). \u00a0BUT, I do use Jackie Robinson\u2019s rookie year of 1947 as the dividing line for the modern era., 63829=Unfortunately, fantasy value cannot be boiled down to one statistic. \u00a0It can be boiled down into Standings Points but each of the 5 categories contribute exclusively to Standings Points (e.g., you cannot get more than 12 points no matter how many HRs your team hits or SBs your team steals). \u00a0Without a lowest common denominator across categories, it is more difficult to determine the contribution of a hitter \u2018replacement\u2019. \u00a0For instance, in 1980, below are various OFs that are worth $0 or less and, thus, would be the equivalent of replacement players., 104044=Gregorius Chant says: November 5, 2013 at 3:02 pm (link)}",
    "textBeforeTable": "\u00a0The first notable trend break is in 1921. \u00a0From 1903-1920, only 33 pitchers ever qualified based on the aforementioned \u2018reliever\u2019 definition with no more than 7 in a single year (1917) . \u00a0In 1921, 14 pitchers qualified as relievers and this number only dipped below 10 twice since 1921 (1922, 1927). \u00a0In addition, ace relievers started to appear in the roaring 20\u2019s like the immortal Firpo Marberry and Wilcy Moore (who was the second most valuable pitcher on the 1927 Yankees). The below chart shows the increase in relievers and closers over the past 110 years. \u00a0Relievers (green line) are defined as pitchers who started in less than 30% of their appearances and appeared in at least 30 games. \u00a0Closers (red line) were defined as any pitcher with 10+ Saves. Both of these trends drive how many (if any) relievers should be considered as part of the \u2018rostered universe\u2019 used to create positional averages. \u00a0If relievers exist, they should be part of fantasy baseball (in my opinion). \u00a0This is enforceable in practice through GS/IP limits or dedicated \u201cRP\u201d roster spots (like in Yahoo!). \u00a0Since Saves are RP\u2019s most valuable category, it stands to reason that their usage would increase as the number of closers/co-closers increase.
