However, City have won three of the last four top-flight games at Eastlands (four of five including a League Cup win in December). Carlos Tevez's two goals against Blackpool made him the Premier League's leading South American goalscorer. He has 56 goals, two clear of Uruguayan Gus Poyet. City are the only side yet to score a headed Premier League goal this season (after scoring the most goals from corners last campaign). The Gunners have not kept a clean sheet in their last 15 league and cup away games. The last away match in which they did not concede was a Premier League game at Aston Villa on 27 January which finished goalless. The Gunners have won one of their last eight Premier League away games., 14251=Fofana Heads To France (Wednesday July 29 2015)}",
