Well I didn't need to worry about that on campus as the campus is really lit up at night and walking to my vehicle I always saw at least 1 or 2 security people checking out campus, so that was always a great feeling knowing that someone was out there keeping it safe., 356061=MNSU is a great school. I've been to the campus & its great.The students are relaxed & so nice. The faculty are willing to help with anything you need. Can't wait to start school Spring 2014.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here Minnesota State University Mankato is such a great place to be. There are so many things available to do like study at the library, go swimming, running, working out, playing basketball or Intramural Sports, hanging out the Centennial Student Union, joining one of the many student organizations who plan many events and help everyone, you can volunteer, take a nice walk, jog, or run around campus, or attend any sporting even including hockey which is big here. The great thing about Mankato, is you always find something new to do. Am learning a lot The first couple of semesters, you might get big classes. You make it how you want. You could make it be a negative thing and let it get the best of you. OR you could use it to your advantage. All the students in the classes are going through the same thing as you so you guys can help each other. And something that you really would like is that Teachers are flexible for you to come in to get help, and if they can\u2019t help you I am more than positive you will find someone who can help you. Another good thing about it is that since it is a lecture class, many other people on campus already took the class so they can help you",
