            "There is a bus that students can call so that they don't have to walk home or drive drunk. It's free, and available five days out of the week. There are emergency call buttons on the information boards around campus, and the school offers a police escort service.",
            "While Greek Life is present, there are only a handfull of sororities and fraternities.",
            "There are all sorts of clubs on campus for students, and many activities are hosted as well.",
            "The students that don't mind living in a smaller town.",
            "Homecoming weekend is also Oktoberfest weekend. Many of the college organizations make t-shirts to sell at Oktober fest, and school lets out at noon on Oktoberfest Friday.",
            "The college is great, and cheap.",
            "College events, the science museum, art galleries, boutique shopping, bowling, go the mall, the movie theatre.",
            "The food in the cafeteria is good, but not great. It gets boring. The food in the union is often fresher and better tasting, but it requires dining dollars instead of meal swipes. There aren't many other dining options in Hays.",
            "The dorm life is great. The RAs are very helpful, as are the desk assistants. The buildings aren't super modern, but they have a certain charm.",
            "The gen eds aren't tough in general, but the professors can make things difficult. The art classes are very rigorous.",
            "Be open minded, living in a small town actually isn't so bad. Live in the dorms your first year of college, there isn't much time in classes to make friends and the dorms are the best place to meet people.",
            "A lovely, small college. The majority of people are very friendly and hopeful. The town is small, but a nice place."

Even though FHSU is the cheapest on tuition rates they don't cut back on any of their resources to the students or class materials. Am enjoying being here The people are great very nice, helpful and fun to be around. I was new to the campus and to Hays in January and now it seems like I grew up around here it's great! I grew up in a big city and I was worried about the transition to a smaller town but it wasn't so different, which was a big relief for me. Am learning a lot My classes are great! I have so much fun in them and learn a lot. Everyone has had those teachers that say they care but they really could care less about you or your grade. That is far from the case at FHSU the teachers really do care about your grades and are willing to help you on anything they possibly can no matter how long it might take.
