To come up with the rankings, using only their statistical performance to date this season, each team is simulated against every other team 100 times (50 at home and 50 away) so that all five pitchers in the current rotation start ten times at each location. (Note: If a pitcher who was in the rotation was recently put on the DL, he will not be included in the simulations.)
