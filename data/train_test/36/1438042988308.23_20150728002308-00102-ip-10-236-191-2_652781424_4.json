    "textBeforeTable": "As you can see there is really nothing to sustain the claims that ProBux is a Scam. Like in every business there will be those who will succeed and those who will not, and normally those that not succeed do not deal very well with it and end up putting the blame on others. In this case saying that ProBux is a Scam and blaming it for their failure. We will continue to monitor this site. If anyone would like to share their experience that they had with this site, whether it is good or bad, feel free to do below. Summary ProBux Sites that are unreliable and probably a scam site, administrators will not invest much time and money into the system and this can be easily seen on sites SCAM. But as we have seen, ProBux shows the opposite. Another very important factor is the money invested. In other words, the more someone invests money in a business, the more he will engage with it. Based on some analysis is easy to see that administrators have invested a lot of money, time and dedication to ProBux works perfectly. We realize that ProBux is not downtime/offline as other sites and neither has slow, it shows that its managers have invested a lot of money on dedicated servers and ddos protection so that your system can handle high traffic and follow",
