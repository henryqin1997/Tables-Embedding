            "Between the Brown Police, Providence Police, and various other security companies hired by the school, students almost never need to feel unsafe.",
            "Greek life participation is much higher among men than women. Although, much of the nightlife is dictated by fraternities.",
            "There is just about any club you can imagine from sports, to theater, to arts, and anything else in between. There are talks, performances, and social events every night.",
            "Students who love to explore their own curiosities as opposed to typical school subjects. Brown is very conducive to independent study.",
            "Even though dining services is not excellent, that does not keep the main dining hall The Ratty from being full of students from open to close.",
            "Worth every penny.",
            "Whatever you want. If you like something, chances are someone else at Brown does too.",
            "While Brown may be in the top 10 for vegan friendly dining services, the food overall is lackluster, and the meal plan is a pain.",
            "The open atmosphere at Brown carries into dorms as well. Most everyone is friendly and greets each other with a smile. The facilities themselves, however, leave a bit to be desired.",
            "With some of the most respected names in academia, Brown offers brilliant teaching with a highly interesting and challenging courses. Depending on concentration, students may spend between 3-8 a day on homework.",
            "Prospective students should be looking for a liberal education and a high level of academic rigor. Brown students' only required classes are those within their major (or concentration), so prospective students should want a large degree of freedom with their education.",
            "Brown fosters an open environment where all ideas are heard and respected. The university encourages students to find their own answers, while learning from top professors in the field. And with the open curriculum, students choose their own academic path."

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Brown University really emphasizes the learning experience for undergraduate students. With no core curriculum, students have the opportunity to explore courses in fields they would not have the opportunity to at other colleges. As a result, a student can obtain as specific or as broad an education as he or she chooses. Additionally, with the option to take courses for a grade, or pass/fail, Brown takes off the competitive pressure and simply encourages its students to try different things and put themselves out of their comfort zone without running the risk of damaging one's transcript and resume for graduate school education. But learning at Brown goes well beyond the classroom - almost all of which are taught directly by professors as opposed to teaching assistants, and which vary in size to accommodate all modes of learning. The extracurricular opportunities at Brown are incredible. There are a lot of service programs through the Swearer Center or other organizations, as well as many opportunities to learn about new subjects - whether that be through attending a guest lecture or debate, or just walking through the main green to see the displays.
