The professors provide adequate lessons that requires interaction with classmates, and provides research opportunities with real-life scenarios.

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Champlain is great for people who love the environment; they put a lot of emphasis on it. It's also good for people who like to put a heck of a lot of extra time into their in-class assignments. Most classes require it anyway but if you enjoy working on things at home or in your dorm until it's perfected then you'll excel here in no time. Tips for prospective students When you get there you'll find you have a heck of a lot of freedom, teachers won't care if you show up to class but they sure as heck won't care if you fall behind because of fooling around either. If you're not serious in what you're doing (and I'm not talking about the occasional mental health day) then you'll fall behind quick and it's hard to come back up. Don't make too many mistakes and you'll make it just fine. Bang for the buck Despite this being a private college, it's a little pricey. If it wasn't one of the best for my major and didn't have so much to do I'd say it wasn't worth it but it's alright for what I'm learning. Am enjoying being here",
