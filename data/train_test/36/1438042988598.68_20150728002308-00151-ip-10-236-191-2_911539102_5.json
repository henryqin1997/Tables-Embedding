            "Don't feel bad or embarrassed that you are starting off at a community college, like I did. It really is an excellent way to see how different college is from high school and gives you a great opportunity to learn more about what you have to do to succeed in college. Go to class, read instructions carefully, and make the most of it(:",
            "You are paying way less for the same basic courses that other students are taking at 4-year universities.",
            "I thought I wasn't going to like it, I will admit. But, I actually look forward to class everyday. It's small enough to make new friends (which is always good) but still bigger than high school so you'll probably see a new face everyday. Some of the teachers are fantastic! They will truly care about you and aren't just there getting a paycheck. It's located near a lot of different restaurants and I enjoy all the activities that TCC has to offer.",
            "I cannot believe how interested my teachers have me in their classes. I used to hate government in high school and now it's my favorite class! The learning is on a deeper level, it's not just about memorizing facts anymore. The work keeps me challenged and I know I will be prepared when I transfer to a 4 year university."

They go fast as they are first-come, first-serve. Also, don't buy your software before you go to the bookstore first.

TCC is another tract that students can take in finishing their degrees, TCC offers so many different class times and locations, making it easier for busy students. Tips for prospective students Get involved on campus, though it seems difficult. Join a club or Honor Society or start your own club. Do not be ashamed for being a student at a community college, in the end you will not have near as many student loans as the other four year university grads! Bang for the buck TCC's tuition is very affordable! They make paying tuition a breeze by offering scholarships, loans, and payment options.",
