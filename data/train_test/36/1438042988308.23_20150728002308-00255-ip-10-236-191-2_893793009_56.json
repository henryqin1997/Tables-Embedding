            "Although Toledo can be a little on the wild side you can always feel safe because of the high security because our police department is right on campus. The police are also constantly patrolling to ensure the safety of all of the students. We also have a system called night watch which is like a taxi service for the campus but is only used at night when you feel unsafe walking alone.",
            "The University of Toledo has an outstanding number of fraternities and sororities to choose from.",
            "There are a tons of clubs to join from medieval clubs to drama clubs. There are several dance teams, cheer leading, band, chess clubs, and so much more!",
            "Toledo is great for students that love the idea of a one to one relationship with their professor. Also for the bold student that likes to adventure and try new thing.",
            "A tradition that goes a long way at The University of Toledo is TOL-EDO . This chant can be heard mostly at football games, basketball games, etc, but this chant can as easily be heard while walking on you way to your 8am class. So if you heard someone call out TOL! don't be afraid to yell EDO!",
            "The University of Toledo is a good stepping stone for students wanting to achieve a higher goal. While at Toledo you will gain responsibility, structure and everlasting memories.",
            "At the University of Toledo you will always have something going on from football games, basketball games, soccer games, etc. You can also find fun things on flyers posted up around campus and in your dorm. Living in dorms you have a lot of planned events that allow you to meet and interact with people in your dorm.",
            "The best dining halls I've been to so far even after visiting several top elite ivy league schools. The University of Toledo dining halls are so good because they cater to every racial background by providing dishes that are from those nationalities. The best dining hall there is on campus is Ottawa Dining Hall.",
            "Everyone must experience dorm life because it allows you to grow and learn more about yourself as a person.",
            "Professors strive to help students individually to succeed because they would rather take the time to help the student pass than to allow the students to fail.",
            "Although the University of Toledo has a large campus its not to overwhelm you, but to make you crave to explore. Get to know the campus because the more you know the campus the easier it is to commute to your classes. Also get involved in an activity that is outside your boundaries. I say because getting involved on campus will help you become more diverse, and simply meet new people. Lastly just have fun but make sure you control your college experience don't let college control you.",
            "The University of Toledo is an outstanding school that encourage students to exceed their academic abilities. This school success is due to the high interactions between professors with their students on first name bases. A student being a name rather than a number is the foundation to a student wanting to excel at The University of Toledo."

Everyone around campus is so ready to help answer questions, or they know who can. It really makes it easy on us., 409044=This is definitely a university level school in terms of workload, however the consistency from one 2000 level course(or any level) to another can vary extremely., 27121=I am an undergraduate student, and a freshman at UT. For those high school seniors migrating here for 2014 I recommend you go on as many tours, incoming freshman events, and orientation, as soon as possible. There is so much to have done by the time you are expected to move in. UT is a convenient size campus, and takes about 15 minutes to get from one end to the other. If you can get acquainted and familiar with your locations and directions the first week of college will be a breeze! I also recommend you use that week to get familiar with the programs and work opportunities for those seniors looking for additional financial assistance in college. Remember, loans are helpful, but sometimes there are alternatives! UT is excellent when it comes to work study programs!, 81835=College is going to be expensive where ever you choose to go (unless you have a full ride) but this college applies your dollars honestly. They even have a lab fee (which covers the cost of printer paper) that is meant only for you. For example, you pay them $50 in the beginning of the semester and that gives you 1200 of paper to use for printing in the lab. They even let you see your account balance on every computer when you log in. That way, you know how much you have spent., 381782=The choices on and around campus are varied and geared towards college students. May be a little more pricey but good food nonetheless., 417722=Academic rigor will always vary among programs, but I've seen students here doing some pretty impressive work. Psychology students do original research, and linguistics students do field work. I've heard of anthropology students also doing fieldwork. Seniors in the engineering department are expected to present original designs. 1000-2000 level classes tend to be really easy, but you can still learn a lot from them. Upper-level classes can get pretty intense; class sized can get tiny, so there's a lot of contact with the prof, and you have to know your stuff., 121775=when i began attending here in fall 2008 the food was a lot better then it is now. they have tried to make a lot more healthy choices available for the students., 612779=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
