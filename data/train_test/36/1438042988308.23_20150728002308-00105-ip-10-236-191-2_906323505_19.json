The Aggie RecCenter has an indoor heated swimming pool and facilities for weightlifting, cardiovascular workouts, racquetball, basketball, and other physical activity. As for off-campus attractions, depending on your tastes there's more to do in the Lawton area than there is than in the rest of the land between Dallas and OKC. Nearby Lawton is the Wichita Mountain Wildlife Refuge, which hosts a number of activities throughout the year and is a great place for all sorts of outdoor recreation. Also nearby is Medicine Park, a small resort town-like community that features a variety of shops, restaurants, and come spring 2014 will also host an aquarium and natural sciences center. Lawton (and Medicine Park) are adjacent to Lake Lawtonka, which provides opportunities for fishing, boating, swimming and the like. If museums are more your thing, there's a few in the area; the Museum of the Great Plains, the Ft. Sill Museum, and the Comanche National Museum and Cultural Center., 130737=I live at home. My friends live in the dorms and they say it is very convenient for them. Their class is 8:00 A.M, they get up at 7:50. Pretty quick traveling, if you ask me. Get the most rest that way, I would think! But, they do mention that sometimes, there are parties on the same floor, or floor above them who do make the sleeping process hard., 69489=Make sure to apply for scholarships specifically the PLUS this scholarship has a firm deadline usually sometime in February., 157437=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 20473=Be sure to look into financial aid like a federal Pell Grant or Cameron University's General Scholarship. You can cut your fees almost in half this way. Be sure to apply for the general scholarship early! The initial deadline tends to be in the spring, around February. They only consider applicants after this point if they still have money left to award.}",
