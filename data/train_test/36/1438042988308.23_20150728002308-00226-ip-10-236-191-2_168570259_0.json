    "textAfterTable": "Dropped Out: The biggest changes based on your input and my second thoughts are: * I added Mizzou and FSU and dropped out Boise State and ASU. I think Boise had their run and, as an outsider, won't be able to recover from the lost I think Hawaii will give them. If they lose that one, they don't play anybody else that will help them \"recover\" in the polls. * Also, based on your opinions, I dropped UGA down a few places. I still am picking them as my \"sleeper\" top 10 team, just not as high as I had them before (the whole idea of sleeper meaning nobody saw them being that good when the season started). Everyone's input made me reconsider my previous ranking there. Finally, as I always say -- preseason polls don't mean squat. I don't think one can get a true indication of a team until three games are played. But where's the fun in that, right? Posted by Yost at 3:06 PM Email This BlogThis! Share to",
