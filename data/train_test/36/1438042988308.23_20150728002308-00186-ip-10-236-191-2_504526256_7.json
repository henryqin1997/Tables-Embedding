No. 5,237,269 (Aimi et al.) issued Aug. 17, 1993, and assigned to International Business Machines Corporation, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, describes connections between circuit chips and temporary carriers for use in burn-in tests whereby the pads on a ceramic substrate are covered by an overlay of non-wettable material to which solder will not adhere whereby the overlay has an opening through which solder flows to make a restricted joint between the solder ball of the chip and the lead line of the carrier;, 27964=U.S. patent application Ser. No. 24,549, entitled \"Method And Apparatus For In-Situ Testing of Integrated Circuit Chips\", filed Mar. 1, 1993, (Attorney Docket No. EN9-93-001), assigned to International Business Machines Corporation, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, provides a method and apparatus for in-situ testing of integrated circuit chips whereby the electrical contacts between the semiconductor chips to be tested and those of the carrier are made by means of dendritic surfaces such that there are vertical projections between the contacts resulting in a fracturable joint;, 32061=U.S. Pat. No. 4,740,099 (Philipoussi), issued Apr. 26, 1988, to Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale, describes an arrangement for temporarily soldering plates together such that they can be mechanically released. This is accomplished by restricting the areas to which the solder can be applied. The fracturable connection results from areas which are limited for the application of solder;, 29805=IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, \"Wafer Level Test And Burn-In\", Volume 34, No. 8, pp. 401-404 (January 1992), describes burn-in testing of a wafer containing semiconductor chips on a carrier such that the contact pads between the contacts are made of two-level solder structure with a small contact area between the two levels. The two levels are comprised of high melting point solder and low melting point solder., 32813=U.S. Pat. No. 4,360,142 (Carpenter et al.), issued Nov. 23, 1982, to International Business Machines Corporation, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, describes solder connections for electrically joining semiconductor devices to a supporting substrate., 29016=U.S. Pat. No. 5,007,163 (Pope et al.), issued Apr. 16, 1991, to International Business Machines Corporation, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, describes a non-destructive method of performing electrical burn-in testing of semiconductor chips by making use of a eutectic mixture which remains liquid at certain temperatures for forming a readily fracturable connection;, 31797=U.S. Pat. No. 5,170,930 (Dolbear et al.), issued Dec. 15, 1992, to Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation, describes the use of a thermally and electrically conductive paste for making a detachable connection between two surfaces;, 32478=U.S. Pat. No. 4,526,859 (Christensen, et al.), issued Dec. 12, 1983, to International Business Machines Corporation, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses a method of selectively metallizing a ceramic substrate provided with a metallization pattern using photoresist processing; and, 29431=IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, \"Burn-In/In Situ Testing of Computer Chips\", Volume 36, No. 3, pp. 229-231 (March 1993), describes burn-in testing of semiconductor chips in which no permanent connection between the chip contact and the substrate is required which results from limited area pads with smaller solder ball carrier surfaces; and, 28605=U.S. Pat. No. 5,173,451 (Kinsman, et al.) issued Dec. 22, 1992, to Micron Technology Inc., provides for a soft bond for semiconductor dies wherein a reduced sized wire bond is used to create a readily fracturable joint to separate the chip from the carrier such that less bonding force is required to retain the lead wires to the carrier than the attachment strength of the pads on the chip;}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations However, it should be noted that while the present invention has been particularly described, in conjunction with a specific preferred embodiment, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description. It is therefore contemplated that the appended claims will embrace any such alternatives, modifications and variations as falling within the true scope and spirit of the present invention. Although it is apparent that a specific preferred embodiment of the process of creating a readily fracturable connection has been described using specific examples, as well as a semiconductor carrier, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many alternatives may be used without digressing from the spirit of the disclosed invention. The preferred embodiment of the invention has been described as preparing and treating contact points on a semiconductor chip carrier in order to create a detachable fracturable joint, as well as a semiconductor chip carrier. However, the disclosed invention has application in forming a fracturable connection between two appropriately treated surfaces and electrical contact points per se are not a requirement to the enjoyment and implementation of the disclosed invention. It has been found that a thin film of nickel which has been etched by a vapor blast is not easily wettable when it is diffused in the surface of molybdenum. This could be simply because the surface",
