            "Look, it's an urban campus. You can't go waltzing around in your bathrobe to get beer at 10 at night, because you're likely to get robbed. Just act like an adult and get yourself together, and don't ride the Red Line on holidays. You'll be fine.",
            "Non-existent. The party scene is freaky, but we don't have sororities or frats.",
            "I'm not a huge part of clubs on campus, but most of them are kinda quirky and active. For example, there's a Doctor Who club who sells pastries in my building every first Tuesday of the month, and then they just get together to watch new episodes and geek out together. Clubs aren't in your face, but they're not invisible, either. It's a nice balance.",
            "Dedicated, driven, and passionate about what you want to do with your life. Seriously, don't waste your tuition dollars if you're wishy washy. Know what you want to do with your life, have passion, and then come, because you'll meet some great people who can help you get to where you need to go.",
            "Columbia has this crazy diverse culture, so you can find just about anyone from any walk of life anywhere on campus. I have met people from just about every country/state, every skin color, and every economic background. Diversity is a huge thing about Columbia. Also, the gay culture is huge, and they all band together for Halloween and do these parades. They're a little overbearing, but Halloween is fun at Columbia.",
            "Okay, Columbia is crazy expensive. They stick you on fees, and the books are crazy expensive. But if you're smart, there are ways to just pay tuition and get a really great education. The Upass, which is included in your tuition, is SUPER awesome, because you can get anywhere within the limits of the CTA for FREE. And the classes, while a pain to schedule, are really pretty content heavy and worthwhile.",
            "Columbia has a major drinking/party scene, but there are ways around that if you have a more delicate constitution. There are events almost every night, including big ones like the open mics and the Art Crawl. Popular ones are the Cinema Slapdown, where scary film buffs get together and debate a film to pieces. There are big parties like the Blood Ball, and the Creepy Coming Out Ball on Halloween, and Manifest at the end of the year. No one can say there's nothing to do at Columbia.",
            "I never had a meal plan-- there are kitchens in most dorms, and I'm a vegetarian foodie-- but I've heard that the dining is pretty good. Also expensive.",
            "The dorms at Columbia suck. Not the buildings-- no, the buildings are fine, especially since you pay an average of $5,000 a semester to live in them. No, the roommate roulette is the sticker. I had 10 different roommates my first year, and I was the only one that stayed. I made some good friends, but sharing an apartment with four other people you barely know is really difficult. Get a roommate and get an apartment.",
            "The core classes tend to be pretty easy unless you pick the oddball ones, like the Israeli/Palestinian Conflict (which is really work-intensive) or Personal Wellness (which is just wicked difficult). The major classes, however, suck up your life and can be pretty thought-provoking. Be prepared for late nights, especially if you're a dance, fashion, or journalism major.",
            "Make SURE you know what you want to do before you apply. A lot of kids come, decide they want to switch majors after their first semester, and drop out; if you're not beyond dedicated and okay with being poor for the rest of your life, Columbia is probably not for you. Other than that, please come, because you will spend every waking moment doing the work for the major you love, plus you get to meet some pretty awesome people.",
            "Columbia is a really distinct, vibrant, colorful, diverse atmosphere with a pinch of eccentric. The academics are great, but the social scene is really odd and difficult to fall into. Once you find the right friends-- typically other people in your department-- the school really comes together and fits you like a glove."

Tips for prospective students Make sure you get some kind of Chicago guide [like Not For Tourists] to make sure that what you like is around the school. Also, get a bike---WITH A GOOD LOCK!
