Meyers Swimming Center. The rhythm just felt right. How did he know? The charismatic Chatfield Senior High swimmer flashed the No. 1 signal prior to the 50-yard freestyle finals on May 9., 27221=LAKEWOOD \u2014 Marin Olson and her Columbine Lady Rebels teammates have had to adjust. First, they lost leading goal scorer Tatum Barton to injury in the last week of the regular season, and then there was the weather. Rain pelted Lakewood Memorial Field on May 8 for the second round of the 5A state girls soccer tournament., 21890=DENVER \u2014 A May ending to their Chatfield girls lacrosse careers was inevitable for Kendra Lanuza, the school\u2019s career scoring leader, and Adam Everett, the lone coach in program history. They just wish it had come later than the second round of the state playoffs.\u00a0, 31602=The city, Town Hall Arts Center, and Arapahoe Community College put on the event, the first of four monthly art walks through August. Eleven downtown galleries participated, ranging from the Steve Adams Gallery on Curtice Street to the Depot Art Gallery five blocks away on West Powers Avenue. From 6 to 9 p.m., the downtown area was lined with street musicians, food vendors and artists giving live demonstrations of their work., 22198=But no farewell tears were shed or regrets uttered after second-seeded Mullen struck for two goals in the first overtime and held on for a 10-9 home victory on May 8., 20581=Chatfield (11-10), which opened the season 2-9, rallied to win the 5A Jeffco League title for the first time in 25 years. It followed that up with back-to-back wins on May 9 in the 5A District 4 tournament to seal its bid to state., 40235=Copyright \u00a9 2015, 23388=AURORA \u2014 Dakota Ridge High School\u2019s lead golfer Gillian Vance led the 5A Northern Regionals tournament beautifully until a hiccup at the end. She came in second overall May 4 at the Aurora Golf Club at Heather Ridge., 24738=The host Lady Falcons, the No. 2 seed in the inaugural 12-team 2A state girls soccer tournament, weren\u2019t about to let their upstart opponents rain on their parade. Marcella Marquis scored the first of Front Range Christian\u2019s three first-half goals, and Sophie Kern added a pair in the second half for a 5-0 victory May 8.}",
