Is he hurt? If not, the 10th-overall pick of the 2002 draft has apparently fallen behind undrafted 25-year-old Adam Morrissey on the depth chart. In terms of defense, Meyer plays on a different field than his AAA peers. In terms of hitting\u2026 not so much. Meyer himself turns 25 at the end of the month., 103071=I don\u2019t mean to pile on. I just think that many Ranger fans, me included, have viewed him primarily in terms of his potential rather than what he\u2019s actually done. We keep waiting for the \u201creal\u201d Hank Blalock of 2003 to return, but he continues to drift away. Every week provides more evidence that he can\u2019t hit lefties, can\u2019t hit on the road, and can\u2019t hit after mid-July. His five-year, $15.25 million contract looked like a bargain in 2004. No longer. Texas owes him $10.7 million in 2007-2008., 25313=5. Geno Petralli, catcher, 1987, 104136=Posted by Lucas at 09:06 AM, 27238=Toronto selected nineteen-year-old Geno Petralli in the third round of the 1978 draft. Beginning in 1982, he briefly appeared as a Blue Jay over three seasons but couldn\u2019t supplant Ernie Whitt or even establish himself as a backup. Toronto sold his contract in 1984 to Cleveland , which dumped him altogether the next April. On May 17, 1985 , Petralli gulped hard, said a little prayer, and signed with the 9-24 Texas Rangers. He soon took over backup catcher duties, a role he would fill for almost all of his career., 106308=Posted by Lucas at 01:02 AM, 22239=Posted by Lucas at 03:01 PM, 24664=Posted by Lucas at 06:02 PM, 68383=Posted by Lucas at 01:33 PM, 2008=August 19 \u2013 started in left field, played entire game August 20 \u2013 did not play August 21 \u2013 no game August 22 \u2013 pinch-hit for Gabe Gross in 7th, played left field August 23 \u2013 did not play August 24 \u2013 did not play August 25 \u2013 did not play August 26 \u2013 started in left field , pulled as part of double-switch after five innings August 27 \u2013 started in left field, played entire game, 70978=5.4 walks allowed per nine innings. 5.7 walks per nine in July. Ordinary .242/.367/.426 line against righties., 71113=Posted by Lucas at 08:59 PM, 69782=The Ballpark in Arlington, 29 July 2006., 73829=Blalock I wrote about him at my blog on Saturday. Blalock has batted well in August -- .304 with two triples(?) -- but has a history of extreme second-half fades and persistent struggles against lefties and on the road. Showalter has benched him in two of the last three games against a lefty starter. I kid you not: over the coming weeks he could actually hurt owners in mixed leagues. His owners must practice active roster management to protect themselves., 28993=4. Tom Grieve, outfielder, 1973, 32297=Fortunately for Grieve, Texas sold outfielder Rico Carty to the Cubs, and only Burroughs was hitting well among the other outfielders. Given three consecutive starts in center in mid-July, he went 5-for-11 with two walks. Soon, Grieve earned semi-regular play and batted an astonishing .336/.390/.589 over the season\u2019s final ten weeks. He hit seven homers in 107 at-bats during that span, by itself good for sixth-best on the team. For the 4,000 or so fans who attended a typical late-season game, Grieve offered a reason to cheer., 17651=It\u2019s nice to have Young back, in theory. In practice, maybe not so much. Young does have the warm \u2018n\u2019 fuzzy memories of 2004 attached to his name, but he also has the exact same skill set and handedness as Jerry Hairston plus nine additional years of wear and tear. What, honestly, does he bring to a team with its playoff hopes hanging by a thread? I think the Eric Young Farewell Tour is a terrific idea. I just didn\u2019t expect it to begin a week before rosters expanded., 39195=My own embryonic Infinite Cat Project: Jack, 2 August 2006, underneath a picture of Jack, 15 July 2005., 88625=Hank Blalock's Closest Batting Comparisons, 2004-Present, 1390=Diaz has cratered this year (.223/.275/.334 in AAA Norfolk) after showing promise in the Majors last year (.257/.329/.468). Still, he doesn\u2019t turn 25 until December., 30920=Washington selected Grieve out of high school with the sixth pick of the 1966 draft, four choices after Reggie Jackson (and five after Steve Chilcott). By 1969, he reached AAA, and in 1970 he grew into a power spike of thirteen homers in only 182 at-bats, though perhaps the AAA affiliate\u2019s move from Buffalo to Denver helped. On that basis, Washington recalled him midway into the 1970 season. Grieve grounded to short against New York\u2019s Fritz Peterson in his big-league debut. The next day, batting second in front of Frank Howard, he singled off Cleveland\u2019s Sam McDowell for his first hit. Later that series, he belted his first homer and finished the day at .316/.350/.526., 38891=Posted by Lucas at 10:27 PM, 77096=Unfortunately, Blalock\u2019s problems have extended to the season\u2019s early months. His pre-break numbers have declined from 2004\u2019s stellar OPS of .941 to 2005\u2019s adequate .825 to 2006\u2019s vanilla .795. Ignoring his abortive 2002, cutting his career in halves produces the following:, 75664=Wells's absence opens the door for Edinson Volquez to start against Oakland on Monday. One of the Rangers' top pitching prospects, Volquez has an eyepopping 130 strikeouts and just 89 hits allowed in 120 Triple-A innings. He also has, gulp, 72 walks. Volquez struggled mightily in a few MLB starts in 2005 and is probably still too raw to offer much value. Still, his upside is substantial. Make a note to check his performance Monday night., 22508=Holly Street Power Plant, Austin, Texas, 13 March 2006., 76736=Everyone knows his second-half troubles. The DMN\u2019s Gerry Fraley mentioned Blalock\u2019s improved diet and workout regimen in a column last month, but to date they haven\u2019t helped. His 2006 post-All Star break line is .266/.298/.316., 103774=Posted by Lucas at 09:06 PM, 31612=Grieve batted only .175/.286/.309 the rest of the way and couldn\u2019t force himself into Washington\u2019s plans for 1971. He spent the entire season in Denver (playing only 93 games, so perhaps he was injured) while similarly aged outfielder Elliott Maddox and younger Jeff Burroughs spent much of the season in Washington. Grieve again reached the Majors for Texas in 1972 and again he struggled, batting .204/.271/.296. In 1973, 25 years old and in his seventh professional season, Grieve was relegated to defensive replacement and pinch running duties. Through the season\u2019s first two months he earned only sixteen plate appearances, getting two singles and eight strikeouts., 102809=Since 2005, just one of Blalock\u2019s ten most similar hitters plays on a corner. Blalock compares most favorably to Orlando Hudson, who supplies most of his value with his glove. During 2006 alone, Blalock\u2019s best comparison is Kansas City\u2019s Emil Brown., 16680=Posted by Lucas at 04:58 PM, 18136=Posted by Lucas at 05:28 PM, 19079=To answer this question, I used Baseball-Reference.com to find the Rangers winning percentage during the last 33 games of every season (except strike-shortened 1981 and 1994). I then compared them to the winning percentages during the rest of the season (the first 111 to 129 games depending on season)., 44254=On Friday, shortstop Joaquin Arias made three terrific plays to his right that had the crowd gasping. Arias batted .277 with no extra-base hits or walks during the series. This season, Arias (.271/.302/.372) has done an uncomfortably accurate impersonation of Ramon Nivar\u2019s 2004 (.264/.290/.374). Fortunately, he\u2019s almost four years younger and has time to grow. I mean physically grow: right now he looks like a kid wearing his dad\u2019s jersey., 22885=Posted by Lucas at 12:32 PM, 32843=Grieve spent only one full season as an everyday player, hitting twenty homers and driving in 81 in 1976, and in 1977 he was part of an infamous four-team, twelve-player trade. By 1979 his on-field career had ended as a Cardinal. He rejoined the Rangers in 1981 in the front office, and within four years he became the general manager, a role he would hold for ten years. He then became an announcer for televised games and fulfills that role today. Thus, Grieve has worked for the Rangers and preceding Senators for 38 of the last 41 years., 17272=Posted by Lucas at 12:29 AM, 39402=Posted by Lucas at 02:59 PM, 1569=Posted by Lucas at 04:56 PM, 40241=In his first twenty games, Wilkerson struck out in an ungodly 40% of his plate appearances (34 of 85) and often seemed utterly helpless at the plate. No, strikeouts don\u2019t normally hurt more than any other type of out, but Wilkerson certainly didn\u2019t endear himself to fans with his frequent whiffing despite leading the team in homers for much of the season. Only in May (.293/.414/.598) did he avoid dragging down the offense., 41535=I\u2019m not a scout and don\u2019t pretend to carry that skill set. However, last October I briefly conversed with an Austin-based Ranger scout who was also my wife\u2019s history teacher in high school. That discussion imparts a light sheen of reliability on my musings, which are as follows:, 105520=Posted by Lucas at 01:38 PM, 17011=AL West since May 30:, 36792=Entering 1998, age 31, Mike Simms had a career line of .227/.298/.405. While he made the Opening Day roster, Texas couldn\u2019t have expected much. Simms quickly set the tone for his season by homering in his first game, a 20-4 rout of the White Sox. On May 19 th, Simms hit a three-run bomb off an allegedly invincible Randy Johnson to power a 10-4 rout. Though he endured a zero-for-29 stretch in late August, he delivered when needed most. Against division rivals, Simms batted a Bondsian .340/.419/.811 -- five singles, seven doubles, six homers, and six walks. Texas entered the final twelve games of the season one game behind Anaheim . Simms played in eight games and hit .333/.497/.722 with five runs scored and seven batted in. The Rangers finished 8-4, three games ahead of the Angels., 104072=The Ballpark In Arlington, 30 July 2006, 35439=Mike Simms began his career as a Houston Astro, a 6th-round pick in 1985. After two lackluster years in Rookie ball, Simms exploded for 39 homers at low-A Asheville. He would hit only a combined 36 during the subsequent two years in high-A and AA, but he did established himself as a decent prospect with above-average power and excellent patience. In 1990 he received a September call-up and struck out against Craig Lefferts in his MLB debut. Though he didn\u2019t reach the plate again for a full week, he managed to single in the winning run in extra innings., 74410=Eaton, Wells and Volquez Management cautiousness, erratic control and erratic umpiring have limited Adam Eaton to ten innings in three starts, making his future difficult to gauge. I wasn't fond of him before the season and haven't changed my outlook. He posted an ERA of 4.34 prior to 2006, seemingly adequate but earned in the decidedly pitcher-friendly realm of Petco Park. I definitely wouldn't bother with him in mixed leagues. In AL-only leagues he'll help owners in need of strikeouts and perhaps wins, but he could give up ground in ERA and WHIP., 80779=Here\u2019s another exercise that illustrates who he was and who he\u2019s become. I compared his batting line (AVG/OBP/SLG) to all MLB regulars during 2003-2006. Summing the squares of the differences between his and his peers\u2019 average, OBP and slugging percentage reveals his closest comparisons. In an effort to keep things simple, I haven\u2019t adjusted for park factors. As a third baseman, Blalock\u2019s batting peers should mostly players on the corners (first and third base, left and right field, plus designated hitter) with fewer up-the-middle types (catcher, second, short, center field). From 2003 to the present, that is the case: Hank Blalock's Closest Batting Comparisons, 2003-Present, 17142=Here's the 2005 version., 38185=Sad to say, Simms could not parlay his terrific season into long-term success. 1998 was the first and only year in which Simms spent the entire season on a Major League roster. The following spring, a torn Achilles tendon forced him to the Disabled List for four months and he would spent more time on rehab assignment in Oklahoma than on the active roster. With Rafael Palmeiro serving as DH because of injury and Roberto Kelly serving very well as fourth outfielder, Texas had no room for Simms. He received only two late-season pinch-hit appearances in 1999, the last of his career, and did not make the postseason roster. In 2000, a degenerative hip forced him out of baseball at age 33., 45110=Posted by Lucas at 07:43 PM, 20966=The 1979 Rangers gained four games on the division leader during the final 33 games, but they were nine games out at the time, and the strong finish only served to push them just over .500. The 1977 edition was the best in Ranger history until 1999. Its 22-11 finish resulted in four games lost in the standings to the Royals, which ended a white-hot 27-8., 37598=Along with fellow Unknown Pleasures Roberto Kelly (#14) Bill Haselman (#12) and Luis Alicea (#11), Simms helped to keep the Rangers in contention until reinforcements arrived to push them over the top. At the July 31st trading Deadline, Texas had a record of 57-51 and had outscored its opposition by only fourteen runs. On that day, GM Doug Melvin boldly released everyday shortstop Kevin Elster and traded for Todd Zeile, Royce Clayton and Todd Stottlemyre. Texas went 31-23 during the final two months to win the West and the right to play the 114-game-winning Yankees., 713=Texas designated outfielder ADAM HYZDU for assignment and outrighted him to AAA Oklahoma. Rotoworld expressed amazement that Hyzdu stayed on the roster for so long. Hyzdu didn\u2019t survive on merit, rather on Texas\u2019s lack of additional trades or need for another roster spot. Now, the Rangers need his spot, as they have traded 2004 fifth-rounder Mike Nickeas for New York Mets outfielder Victor Diaz. The Mets themselves designated Diaz last week, but Texas probably will add him to the roster and bring him to Arlington on September 1., 58136=Posted by Lucas at 01:53 PM, 27771=Though Petralli now had a regular job, he continued to struggle at the plate. Through 1986, Petralli had a career line of .271/.312/.358, good for an OPS+ of 80. Noted for his patience in the minors, he had walked only once per eighteen plate appearances in the Majors. He entered 1987 as Don Slaught\u2019s caddy for the third consecutive season., 103580=If he can reverse this trend, starting tomorrow, Texas has a great chance of playing October baseball. If not, management has to consider a change, as it did last offseason., 76423=I keep reminding myself that Blalock doesn\u2019t turn 26 until November. We can still use words like \u201cupside\u201d and \u201cpotential\u201d around him without fear of reprisal. Sadly, however, the cold facts demonstrate that Blalock has declined steadily since his stellar 2003, to the point of mediocrity and beyond., 69847=Posted by Lucas at 06:31 PM, 70264=Posted by Lucas at 05:31 PM, 2894=Posted by Lucas at 01:38 AM, 33485=3. Mike Simms, outfielder / first base / pinch hitter, 1998, 40865=Posted by Lucas at 05:35 PM, 70082=I've created an updated draft history that includes peak levels and win shares through 2005. Over time I'll be adding years previous to 1999. The link is at upper right., 75000=I'm even less enamored of Kip Wells. Perhaps you'd read that he rebounded from his shaky return after surgery. He allowed only four runs in his last three starts. Unfortunately, he also allowed 30 baserunners in those starts (1.52 WHIP) and nine more in five innings against Minnesota. Eventually, those baserunners will become runs. Wells does provide an upgrade on John Rheinecker but hasn't pitched well consistently since 2003, and his strikeout rate has fallen off a cliff. Furthermore, he'll miss Monday's start because of a sore shoulder. Avoid him unless you have little to lose. It's hard to envision his presence on a winning fantasy roster., 16885=AL West on May 30:, 95852=Hank Blalock's Closest Batting Comparisons, 2005-Present, 95581=From 2004 to present, only four of Blalock\u2019s closest comparisons play the corners. Lowell makes another appearance along with several other players in decline like Aubrey Huff, Craig Biggio and Geoff Jenkins, all of whom are several years older than Blalock., 36012=Simms couldn\u2019t crack the lineup in 1991 and spent the first half of the season back in AAA. Given a month\u2019s worth of starts in Houston later that year, he showed little beyond an ability to draw plenty of walks (.203/.301/.317). In 1992 he again resided in AAA for most of the season, and in 1993 he never left the minors. After transient assignments in San Diego , Pittsburgh and Cleveland , he returned to the Astros and spent the next three years frequent-flying between Houston and AAA Tucson. Only in 1995 (.256/.341/.512 in 138 plate appearances) did the results match his potential. Simms signed with Texas after 1996 when the Astros waived goodbye. In 1997, he subbed at several positions and, as usual, didn\u2019t offer much at the plate beyond adequate power., 5088=With an average pitching staff, the Rangers needed an offensive effort akin to 1998, when surprising performances from Mike Simms, Roberto Kelly, Luis Alicea and others augmented the expected awesomeness of Pudge, Will Clark and Juan Gonzalez. This season, Texas got its surprises in the form of Gary Matthews, Mark DeRosa, and Ian Kinsler, but, sad to say, the core has underwhelmed. Both Mark Teixeira (despite his recent upsurge) and Michael Young are well off last year\u2019s pace, and Hank Blalock has continued to produce his middling results. As for the others, the departed Kevin Mench appears to have topped out as an average-at-best corner outfielder. Brad Wilkerson played hurt. Phil Nevin and Rod Barajas are replacement-level hitters., 105074=Posted by Lucas at 08:56 AM, 360=\u00ab July 2006 | Main | September 2006 \u00bb, 20245=The 1978 season is a fine analog for the present situation. After August 28, 1978, the top three teams in the AL West ranked as follows:, 24236=Sure enough, against the big boys Tejeda excelled while Koronka inexplicably reverted to nibbling. Watching him try, and try, and try to squeak a third strike by a batter has become a gloomy experience. As for Tejeda, simply being league-average would greatly assist the Rangers\u2019 quest for a fourth division championship and provide a partial answer to the question of who joins Kevin Millwood in the 2007 rotation., 69513=Posted by Lucas at 11:59 PM}",
