But the Class III price estimate for 2010 was raised about a dime from last month due to higher forecast whey prices. The forecast for the Class III midpoint was $15.25 ($14.90 to $15.60) compared to $15.15 ($14.75 to $15.55) a month earlier. However, the Class IV price forecast was lowered reflecting weaker nonfat dry milk prices., 7927=The all milk price is forecast at between $16.20 and $16.90 for 2010 (midpoint $16.55) compared to a midpoint of $16.60 in the January estimate., 7763=The milk production forecasts for 2010 were raised by half a billion pounds to 188.9 billion, up from 188.4 last month. Milk production was forecast higher for 2010 based on the higher-than-expected January 1 dairy replacement heifer estimate. Herds are not expected to decline as rapidly as forecast last month, boosting milk production., 7405=Dairy exports on a skim-solids basis for 2010 are raised, reflecting higher sales of cheese and nonfat dry milk. Import forecasts are lowered for 2010. Fat and skim-solids ending stocks are estimated higher for 2009 and stocks for 2010 are raised in the face of higher production.}",
