Methods and devices for using percutaneous ablative techniques intended to remedy cardiac fibrillation or arrhythmias have been disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,231,995; 5,487,385; WO 94/21165 and WO 96/10961 in addition to U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,228,442 and 5,324,284 to Imran. The disclosures of these references are herein incorporated in their entirety by reference thereto., 38982=Presently, many categories of tachycardia may be detected using the electrocardiogram (EKG). An alternative, more sensitive procedure commonly used to detect localized aberrations in electrical activity, and thus confirm the presence of arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, is the mapping of the cardiac chambers as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,641,649 and 4,699,147 and WO 96/32897., 44860=Certain particular catheter based technologies exist which are intended to emulate all or a portion thereof, the incision patterns of the maze procedure using curvilinear catheters. The use of such catheters in ablative procedures is disclosed in Avitall et al., in \"Physics and Engineering of Transcatheter Tissue Ablation\", Journal of American College of Cardiology, Volume 22, No. 3:921-932 (1993). In addition, the use of transcatheter ablation to remedy atrial fibrillation in a clinical setting, specifically by the use of a percutaneously introduced ablation catheter (with either a 7F deflectable 4-mm tip with thermocoupler; Cordis Webster, Miami, Fla., or a woven Dacron 14 by 4-mm multielectrode from Bard Electrophysiology, Tewksbury, Mass. is described in Haissaguerre, et al. in \"Right and Left Atrial Radiofrequency Catheter Therapy of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation\" in Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology 7(12), pp. 1132-1144 (1996). These articles are herein incorporated in their entirety by reference thereto.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is to be understood from the disclosure above that that particular variations of a broader invention have been described. Additional modifications or variations other than those particularly described may be made based on this disclosure according to one of ordinary skill without departing from the scope of the following claims. In still another procedural aspect of the current invention, patients receiving the long linear lesioning treatment described for the present invention may benefit from the administration of various anticoagulants such as Cumidin and/or Heparin. According to these ranges, providing only one length of ablation element according to the present invention may negate a sizeable, otherwise treatable patient population. It is contemplated that a kit of ablation catheter device assemblies may be required which includes various lengths of ablation elements between anchors. For example, providing a kit with available ablation elements having lengths ranging from approximately 15 millimeters to approximately 70 millimeters, and preferably ranging from approximately 25 millimeters to approximately 55 millimeters, may provide a suitable range to choose from in order to treat most patients. Furthermore, it is contemplated that quantitative pulmonary angiography and/or transesophageal echocardiography may provide sufficient diagnostic tools for measuring a patients inter-pulmonary vein ostia distances prior to long linear lesioning treatment. The kit will also typically include appropriate packaging for the individual devices and instructions for operation and use. For example, patients are known to differ in their anatomical make-up",
