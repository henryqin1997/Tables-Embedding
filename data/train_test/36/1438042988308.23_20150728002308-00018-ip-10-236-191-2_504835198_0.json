It was a much-needed turnaround from the financial disaster a year before., 8230=The five largest individual production costs in 2010 were the same as dairies have been accustomed to for years: feed, replacements, labor and benefits, interest and rent, and milk hauling., 8459=The number one reason for the rebound was due to much higher milk prices (an average of $16.18 per hundredweight in 2010 versus $12.61 in 2009). Number two was much lower feed costs ($7.38/cwt. versus $8.38)., 8020=Fuel and fuel-related expenses have been the fastest rising cost item for Western dairies during the last 10 years. Milk hauling is an obvious example. Another is fuel and oil. From a fairly modest average cost of 9.4\u00a2/cwt. in 2000, fuel and oil rose to a very significant 24\u00a2/cwt. In 2010 \u2013 a 155 percent increase., 7675=By the way, while 2010 was a good year for average dairies, it was an excellent year for excellent dairies. Profitability for dairies that ranked in the top 25 percent of all the firm\u2019s clients had a net profit of $574 per cow., 7428=Join us this coming Monday, September 12 at noon for Hoard's Dairyman free webinar, \"Feeding for Protein Production\". It will be presented by Chuck Schwab and brought to you by Elanco. Register at www.hoards.com/webinars . Past webinars are archived there, too.}",
