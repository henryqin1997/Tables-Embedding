    "textBeforeTable": "Weekend Donington Superleague results FC Basel claimed its maiden Superleague Formula by Sonangol victory by winning the opening race at Donington Park today. The Swiss club\u2019s Max Wissel (D) finished 2.18-secs ahead of the Glasgow Rangers machine of John Martin (AUS) in the 44 minute plus one-lap race around the 2.5 miles (4.02 km) parkland track in the Midlands area of Britain. The heavy rain of yesterday which had caused qualifying to be abandoned; and cause minor damage to a section of the track; was thankfully replaced by sunny intervals encouraging a healthy crowd to attend. Wissel took the opportunity to overtake Martin on lap 12 lap when the backmarker PSV Eindhoven car delayed Martin as the Australian attempted to lap the Dutch car. SLF championship leader Adri\u00e1n Vall\u00e9s (SP), who started from his worst proper qualifying position of the season in 10th place, finished sixth \u2013 just a second behind the Tottenham Hotspur machine of Craig Dolby (GB). The pole-starting Corinthians car of Ant\u00f4nio Pizzonia (BRA) finished third having led until pitting on lap nine but a slow compulsory pit-stop lost the Brazilian valuable time. A second race, followed immediately by a Super Final, will be staged at the British venue later today with Flamingo\u2019s Enrique Bernoldi (BRA) starting from pole-position after spinning out on the opening lap of race one which caused a brief Safety Car period which also saw the front-row starting Olympiacos machine of Davide Rigon (IT)",
