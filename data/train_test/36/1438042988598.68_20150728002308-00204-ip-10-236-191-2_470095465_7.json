Thus, it can be seen from the foregoing specification and attached drawings that the optical fiber cable of the present invention provides an effective cable design which emphasizes the positive features and minimizes the negative features of the prior art. The cable is ruggedly built and will function adequately for a very long period of time. The core filling and flooding compounds used in the cable design of the present invention to give better, less expensive water penetration resistance over water-swellable tape. The medium-density polyethylene outer jacket used in the present design is easier to process, more flexible, and less expensive than high-density polyethylene used in the prior art AT&T LXE cable. Furthermore, the present cable is designed for mid-span entry under taunt conditions since the strength members do not have to be cut to access the optical fibers. The cable of the present invention has a smaller diameter and is lighter in weight than the AT&T LXE design, which improves the ease of installation in ducts. The two steel strength members produce a cable which is stiffer than the Siecor Maxitube design, which facilitates aerial installations. The two steel",
