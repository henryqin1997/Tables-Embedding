Desirably, the spinning solution contains from about 50 to about 60 weight percent basic aluminum chloride., 33087=In the process of the invention, the hollow disc is rotated at a sufficient angular velocity to provide sufficient pressure of the solution against the interior of the circumferential edge to force solution through the openings in a fiber form. Generally, for the viscosities of from about 100 to 450 poise, the sufficient pressure is usually from about 500 to about 2000 grams per square centimeter. Usually the disc is rotated in a horizontal plane for convenience in introducing solution into the disc and for convenience in collecting fibers without interference with other fibers being formed.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes To illustrate the process and the use of the apparatus of the invention, an aqueous solution containing basic aluminum chloride, colloidal silica and lactic acid was concentrated to 63.5 weight percent solids and adjusted with water to a viscosity of 130 poise. The solution was fed into a hollow disc substantially in accordance with the apparatus as previously described. The disc had a diameter of about 15.24 cm and was rotated at about 2,750 rpm. The solution was thus extruded through holes having a diameter of about 0.38 mm. The spinning room humidity was about 55%. The filaments were then blasted with air directed through air nozzles seated into a 3/4\" circular pipe mounted essentially as previously described with respect to the apparatus of the invention. The pressure in the pipe was about 1.4 kg per sq. cm. Under these conditions, fibers with an average diameter of about 4.6 microns were produced after calcining. To illustrate that sufficient pressure must be maintained in the pipe to cause attenuating, dropping the pressure in the pipe to about 0.35 kg per sq. cm increases the average diameter of the finished fibers to about 7 microns. The aqueous solution utilized in this example contained about 55 weight percent basic aluminum chloride and about 10 weight percent of colloidal silica and about 8 weight percent of lactic acid with the balance being water.
