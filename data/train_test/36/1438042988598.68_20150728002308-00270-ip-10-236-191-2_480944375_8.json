It will be understood, however, that this disclosure is, in many respects, only illustrative. Changes may be made in details, particularly in matters of shape, size, and arrangement of parts without exceeding the scope of the invention. The inventions's scope is, of course, defined in the language in which the appended claims are expressed. Referring now to FIG. 4, another embodiment guide wire 74 is illustrated, having a distal member 52 and a proximal member 76. Proximal member 76 shares some features with proximal member 54 of FIG. 3, but can be formed of smaller diameter proximal member wires 80. This may be preferable when use of a smaller diameter proximal member is desired, as may be the case when a small diameter distal member is used. After extending proximal member 76 to the length shown in FIG. 4, a sheath or tube 78 can be slid over wires 80 as illustrated in FIG. 4. In this way, wires 80 can serve as pilot wires for sheath 78. In a preferred embodiment, sheath 78 is a 3 layer tube, having a polyimide tube with an inner and an outer Teflon\ufffd lining. In a preferred embodiment, sheath 78 is about 0.014 inches in outside diameter and has an inner diameter of about 0.012. Sheath 78 can serve",
