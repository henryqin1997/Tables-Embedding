    "textAfterTable": "System Backup and Restoration Cisco SocialMiner Release 8.5(3) supports the Cisco Unified OS Disaster Recovery System (DRS) to perform backup and restoration of the system. You access the Disaster Recovery System by going to the Administration Gadget, expanding the section on Platform Administration, then selecting the link for Disaster Recovery System. SocialMiner uses the same platform administration tools as Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Detailed online help is available in the tools. You can manually back up your system using DRS, or schedule DRS to perform automatic backups. Complete details on using DRS are available in the DRS online help and in this guide: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/drs/8_0_1/drsag801.html. Quick Manual Backup Instructions These instructions provide quick instructions to create a manual backup. You can also schedule backups to run automatically. Note that the system is not usable during a backup, and that new social contacts are not collected during a backup. Schedule your backups accordingly. The online help for the Disaster Recovery System provides complete details on all features of DRS. However, using DRS with SocialMiner is greatly simplified because SocialMiner supports only a single node and only uses network backups. To perform a manual backup: Define Backup Device Access the Disaster Recovery System by going to the Administration Gadget, expanding the section on Platform Administration, then selecting the link for Cisco Disaster Recovery System.",
