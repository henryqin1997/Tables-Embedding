    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{30195=However, batting became his stronger suit as the years went along: in the 2012 season, he bowled only 57 overs in ten first-class matches, and seven in 11 List A games. With the bat, though, he averaged almost 42 in first-class games and more than 36 in List A. He was chosen in Australia's squad for the tour to India, and when he got a Test opportunity when four players were suspended, Smith made the most of his opportunity. ESPNcricinfo staff, 27630=Steven Smith started his career as a promising legspinner and talented batsman, but over the last couple of years, the legspin has taken a definite back seat while his batting has blossomed. That was in ample evidence when he played against India in Mohali in 2013. It was his first Test match in more than two years, and he responded superbly to pressure, scoring 92 and handling the spinners competently to confirm his early potential., 35418=Jul 18, 2015, 56174=Since the beginning of 2012, Ian Bell averages 34.69 when batting in the top six; among regular top-order batsmen, only Shane Watson has a lower average, 36606=Australian One-Day International Player of the Year - 2015, 36474=Allan Border Medal - 2015, 36532=Australian Test Player of the Year - 2015, 33688=Jul 31, 2015, 34525=Jul 19, 2015, 52084=4391 runs after 35, and 2354 outside top five, 48441=Numbers Game: Since 2009, teams batting first have a win-loss ratio which is 61% higher than it was between 2000 and 2008, 29572=A promising start to his state career occurred in 2007-08, when he played his first games in the three domestic formats. In the Pura Cup he opened with 33 and began his FR Cup experience without batting, although he posted 35 in his second attempt. The biggest impact came in the Twenty20 tournament, where he finished the qualifying matches as the competition's joint-highest wicket-taker with nine at a remarkable average of 5.33. His 4 for 15 in the dying stages against a Queensland side chasing 122 helped New South Wales to victory and earned him the Man-of-the-Match award., 28635=Smith became an international player in 2009-10 after starring with New South Wales, striking four Sheffield Shield centuries and finishing the season with career-best figures of 7 for 64. After only 13 first-class games he was picked on a Test tour of New Zealand but didn't get to play. He had already been trialled in the T20 and ODI sides, impressing with his attitude, and was used more as a legspinner than a batsman. Figures of 2 for 78 in his first one-dayer against West Indies don't look great, but he convinced Ricky Ponting to keep the field up to build pressure. Not many 20-year-olds - Smith looks even younger - win arguments like that. He was part of the squad in Australia's journey to the World Twenty20 final and his opening Test series, against Pakistan in England, was encouraging. There were three wickets in the two games and a muscular 77 in the second innings at Leeds.}",
