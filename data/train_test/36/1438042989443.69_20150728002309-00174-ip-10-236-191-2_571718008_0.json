McAnally cars have won five of six races since the NASCAR K&N Pro Series West returned to Roseville, and they\u2019ll try to make it six of seven in Saturday night\u2019s Toyota/NAPA Auto Care 150. Eric Holmes of Escalon has three of those five victories, including last October\u2019s event that vaulted toward his third Pro Series West championship. \u201cIt\u2019s always fun here, and I\u2019ve won all but two of them I think since I\u2019ve been running these cars here, and we probably should have won those two,\u201d said Holmes, who steers the No. 20 NAPA Auto Parts Toyota Camry. \u201cIt feels good to be back here. We know we can come here and win.\u201d McAnally driver Paulie Harraka won the April event last year, but\u00a0the BMR team in Saturday night's Pro Series West event\u00a0consists only of Holmes and Moses Smith. Holmes has led a series-high 516 laps around the one-third-mile oval at All American. Smith is no slouch. He has three top-five finishes in six starts in Roseville, a high finish of third in 2008 and an average finish of sixth. \u201cIf you had anything to do at all with Bill McAnally Racing, you would like Roseville because this track has been so good to us,\u201d McAnally said. \u201cWe want to perform well at home. We work hard for it.\u201d McAnally also works hard as promoter of the Pro Series West races at All American. The events generally sell out, and through April 8, 2,200 tickets were sold. Saturday night\u2019s card also includes SRL and Legends races. McAnally said there were 29 Pro Series West cars entered, 27 SRL machines and more than 40 Legends. A vintage smoker plane also has been added to do a fly-by. \u201cPeople are wanting it. They\u2019re embracing it. They always do,\u201d McAnally said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect any less here.\u201d BMR isn\u2019t going to have it easy. Greg Pursley won the season opener in Phoenix, and he finished third at All American in the fall 2009 race. David Mayhew has finished in the top 10 in all five of his Roseville starts. \u201cGreg Pursley, Jonathon Gomez, David Mayhew \u2013 those three really came on strong all last year,\u201d said Holmes, who finished 14th in Phoenix. \u201cIt\u2019s probably one of the most competitive years we\u2019ve had in a long time. There\u2019s always been two or three guys. This year, there\u2019s about five that could really have a legitimate shot at winning the championship. We definitely have to step up our program, because they\u2019re all gunning for us.\u201d Roseville racer Eric Schmidt will drive the Stephanie Bellotti Teen Fund Chevrolet for Naake Motorsports. Stephanie Bellotti was killed in a car accident in 2002. The fund, established by her parents, Eileen and Vincent Bellotti, at the Placer Community Foundation, provides scholarships to the National Auto Sport Association Car Control Clinic on April 19 in Willows.
