            "Greek life is very involved and they're not cocky or drunks or anything like that as portrayed in many college themed films (or on other campuses)",
            "A bachelor's degree here is cheaper compared to other universities! and there are no problems on campus and the school offers lots of fun activities and even a contest held every tuesday where you could win free tuition for a semester!",
            "The campus always has some event going on! music mondays ( a DJ is either playing music or underground bands come and perform on campus) club sales events (cupcake sales, candy sales, purses, trinkets, pottery and much more) a video game truck sometimes comes to campus and even radio stations, we also get discounts on tickets for the home depot center (come watch the LA Galaxy, Chivas USA, or any other game/performance held there!) on certain holidays there are events held like the easter egg hunt, or even when its not holidays there are giveaway events. During finals there are massages, puzzles, and other stress relieving events present, there's also the torozone with an xbox, ps3, pool tables, and much more, or even go hang out at the sports bar on game nights!",
            "Subway on campus along with surf city squeeze, a sports bar with some yummy wings (deals on wednesday's) a pizza place, a Chinese food place, and other eateries and mini stores around campus! great service and food!",
            "The best tip I can give out is that no matter the rumors that you hear that the school is bad and what not it is not true. Many say that because it is next to compton it is a terrible school. Compton isn't even an issue to the school as it is like 10 minutes away and does not interfere with the city of carson. Also if you'd like to get into technicalities, USC is also in a poor area, so why not also bash on USC then if you have that kind of mentality. Also do not believe the rumors that are said about CSUDH accepting anyone no matter how low their GPA or terrible grades or without completing any pre-requisites, as this rumor is not true. The school is not lenient, the school will look at your GPA and will make sure that you have completed all required work. The school is diverse, (yes african americans and hispanics are the majority) but there is a little bit of everything on campus. Also the classes are not easy, those who say that they are easy are either lying or had a professor that honestly did not really care about teaching and rewarded the students with good grades. You must study, and study well as it will be the only way to graduate.",
            "Great school for both undergraduate and graduate work. The campus itself, the students, and professors are all very kind and willing to help a student out and are also very inviting. The school is not a party school but rather a community school where people work together and have fun (that does not involve drinking or smoking, etc.) but by holding events that let students become involved on campus."

Whether it's a back up or you've been planning to come here all along, it's a great school to have as an option. The admission rate is about a 2.4 average, so it's not too hard to get in to Dominguez, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't keep your grades up., 321883=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 38730=there is also active greek life on this campus, but not so active since 2009., 51744=The bar has taco Tuesday! The 1910 restaurant has a buffet. You can never really go wrong with Subway. If those choices do not satisfy your fancy, there are other fast food places in the dining hall.

They also have other Masters in Nursing for administration and education I believe. Tips for prospective students The paperwork requirements are very detailed, start early filling out and gathering your documents or you could be left out of matriculation. Bang for the buck Although the tuition price is increasing, it is still a bargin for a masters-level education, which I very much appreciate. Am enjoying being here I am not physically on campus much, but have noticed the student union, which seems to be tuned in to outreach. Am learning a lot The current learning experience is via distance learning, it",
