            "If you enjoy the outdoors, can appreciate a good cup of coffee, have a passion for the arts, never use an umbrella when it's raining, have an eclectic taste in music, or love puddle jumping, you will fit right in at Western!",
            "Come with an open mind. I guarantee you will love it at Western if you take the time to meet new people, try new things, and get involved.",
            "Western's tuition is comparable to other universities in Washington state, and most students receive financial aid. The quality of the professors and the opportunities you will receive as a Western student make the cost of attending college absolutely worth it.",
            "Bellingham is a quiet, laid-back town that offers many opportunities to have fun off campus. Hiking, kayaking, cliff jumping (I'm not kidding), and enjoying coffee at one of the many local cafes in town are some of the popular activities for students. Western is also wonderful about hosting events for students, including concerts and movie nights. There are also many clubs on campus that range from sports to volunteering to the unique (like the Harry Potter club).",
            "Classes are challenging but always interesting. As an incoming freshman you have a wide selection of course offerings, allowing you to take classes in almost any discipline while working towards completing your graduation requirements. WWU also offers many different majors so almost every student will find a major that they enjoy."

If you can think of a possible club that doesn't already exist, all it takes if 4 friends and a quick application., 695294=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 502302=Along with all of the activities and clubs constantly going on around campus, there are a ton of things to do around town. There is an area of town called Fairhaven where there are a ton of different little shops to go to as well as Boulevard Park to relax and goof off at. You can buy books, crafts, or even make your own piece of art at Creativity. In the downtown area, we have theaters (movies and plays), an imporv theater (where Ryan Stiles sometimes appears) and if you are 21 or over, this is where the bar an club scene is located. Also around town we have a mall where the discount movie theater is located, as well as the Value Village and Spirit Halloween store in October. There is also a location on Lake Watcom where you can rent Kayaks, sail boats, and wind surfers for really cheap., 362253=Apply early! Preferably before November 1st. Your application is like a place holder for housing. The earlier you submit it, the closer to the front you are in line for housing choices.}",

Despite it's reputation as a granola or hippy school, Western has one of the most diverse campuses in the state. A lot of people here are very athletic and enjoy running up to Mt. Baker to ski or snowboard in the winter, but just as many enjoy biking or hiking on any of the area trails. Also, with Bellingham Bay, the San Juan Islands, and Seattle such a short distance away, there's always something to do! Western is a very accepting community and it seems almost impossible not to fit in here! Tips for prospective students While at Western, don't be afraid to try new things! There is an information fair each fall a couple of days before school starts and all the clubs and various student organizations turn out to connect to students",
