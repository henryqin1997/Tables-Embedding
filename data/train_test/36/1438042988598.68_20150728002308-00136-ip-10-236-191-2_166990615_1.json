The Nats believe he'll be ready to come off the DL when he's eligible (Apr 29)., 26402=taeyyenom said\u2026 Get rid of the old man Davey. April 23, 2013 5:29 PM Won't solve the problem. Anyone named to replace him will simply become, like Davey, one of the 30 dumbest people in the world. It's a magical condition that descends inexorably upon every major league manager. Once you become a major league manager, all of deep wisdom, psychological insight and baseball acumen possessed by the any anonymous internet commentator or fan drains completely out of you.It's as old as the sport, and incurable: the 30 managers of major league teams are the dumbest people on the planet.

Though the veteran right-hander has been strong so far in 2013, the Nationals have had considerable success against him. In four head-to-head encounters in 2012, the Nationals twice pounded Wainwright for six runs and knocked him out early.}",
