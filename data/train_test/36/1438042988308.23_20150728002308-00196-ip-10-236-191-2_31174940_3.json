However, our research also shows that the performance during the first half of 2009 should perhaps not yet be cause for celebration, given that over the past two years the decline in house prices in the last six months of the year was significantly worse than during the first half of the year. Whilst we\u2019re cautious about excessive \u2018green shoot\u2019 optimism, the tables below show the current values and % change since the beginning of the year and clearly show areas which may lead any housing market recovery when it comes, as well as those that are struggling. Optimism around a market recovery may well be somewhat premature, but there are some bright spots emerging in the market. Zoopla! research shows the overall pace of house price decline has slowed noticeably compared to last year.
