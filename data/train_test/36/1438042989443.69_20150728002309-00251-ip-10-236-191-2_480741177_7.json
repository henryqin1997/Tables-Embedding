To reduce the number of false edges due to foreground objects, a chroma-keyer 1104 is used to segment the background (which contains the pattern information) from the foreground. This segmentation is performed based on a key signal which describes the distance of a specific pixel from the backing colour (preferably blue or green). To further reduce the number of false edges the key image is preferably filtered 1106 to remove isolated features and pixels near the border of foreground objects. This filtering is preferably done using morphological image processing [Serra, J. Image Analysis and Mathematical Morphology, Academic Press, London 1982].}",

The list of peaks is compared with each edge point to assign an edge point to a peak and to then fit the lines 1208 to provide a list of lines. The line detection process is further described with reference to FIG. 12 for horizontal lines. Vertical lines are processed in a similar manner. 4. Storing the edge points in an edge array. 3. Thresholding the gradient magnitude and suppressing pixels where the gradient response does not have a local maximum. This suppression step is necessary to obtain thin edge contours. 2. Computing a gradient vector (magnitude and directions) at each pixel, by means of x and y spatial derivatives. 1. Smoothing the image to reduce the effect of image noise. Preferably the edge detection process consists of the following steps: Edge detection is then applied 1108 to the background image. The method is not sensitive to the specific edge detector used.
