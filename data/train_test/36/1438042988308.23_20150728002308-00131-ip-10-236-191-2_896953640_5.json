    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{8800=2/11/15: Score one for the big boys. The A's won their arbitration hearing against pitcher Jarrod Parker. Parker missed all of last season recovering from Tommy John surgery and had asked for $1.7 million this season. The arbitrators sided with the A's for half of that. It seems odd that $850,000 would go to arbitration when millions are being thrown about for other players, but that is the MLB system. Parker, as well as A.J. Griffin are expected to be back on the field in June. Meanwhile, Sean Doolittle will miss some time at the beginning of the season, but probably not too much as he recovers from a 'slight tear of the rotator cuff'., 21924=7/3/14: Oakland continues to own the American League West and has a comfortable 4.5 game lead on the LA Angels as the season is about half over. There a lot of reasons the A's are in first place and have the best record in all of MLB, and closer Sean Doolittle is a major one. He let up a run last week to the Miami Marlins, and that was the first run he had allowed in 26.2 innings - one out short of three cumulative complete games. In fact the last time he gave up a run was April 26. He has an amazing 56/1 K/walk ratio, with the last free pass issued on May 20., 25032=5/29/14: Another strong week for the Oakland A's. If this keeps up, then people will have to acknowledge that this team is for real, despite not having any high-priced superstars (possibly because they do not have any high-priced superstars). Unlike the upstart Brewers, the A's improved their lead over the rest of the AL West, while the Brewers are starting to come back down to earth. Oakland has an amazing run differential so far this season - around 100 more runs scored than given up. This is a likeable group and could be a player in late October., 12536=10/29/14: Brandon Moss has emerged as a great player for the Oakland A's over the past couple of years and was rewarded for his good work by getting to his first All-Star Game back in July. But he struggled mightily over the second half of the season, batting just .173 with four home runs. Turns out Moss had a torn labrum and had surgery last week to repair it. It will be another three months before he is running again, and that is just before spring training. He may be eased into playing again next year, but he should be able to be ready to go for Opening Day., 36997=It's been tough sledding for the Oakland A's in recent years, but the team looks to build off a great 2010 season and take big steps forward in the AL West. After finishing second in the division last season, the club put a focus on adding offensive firepower like Matsui. However, at the Mid-Season, the A's still aren't showing much promise. They fired their manager, and have continued to have a losing record with the new one (Bob Melvin). Still sitting in last place in the AL West, the A's have a lot of work to do before the season is up., 16185=8/28/14: Somebody needs to wake the A's back up. Oakland has dominated the AL West (and even most of the American League) for the entire season, but has fallen into a mid-August funk. The Angels have overtaken Oakland, though that can change on any given day. Interestingly enough, the Detroit Tigers have lost their lofty perch in the AL Central to Kansas City. Ironically enough, both teams made major moves at the trade deadline and many are expecting the two teams to meet in the ALCS. But right now, it is possible that one or maybe both could miss the postseason altogether., 29180=10/4/12 Down 5-1 in the fourth inning, the Oakland Athletics, just like the way their season has gone, came back from a big deficit to win the game and the AL West. The A?s scored six runs in the bottom of the fourth inning, two of which came on an error by Rangers center fielder Josh Hamilton. The A?s would score five more runs the rest of the game. In the ninth inning, Grant Balfour retired Rangers third baseman Michael Young on a fly ball to center field to seal the 12-5 win for the A?s and the AL West. On June 30th, the A?s trailed the Rangers by 13 games in the standings. This is the first division crown in six years and 15th in their franchise. With a payroll of $59.5 million, the lowest in baseball, the A?s found a way to overcome the odds and take the division on the last day of the season. They will play the Detroit Tigers in the Division Series., 15028=9/24/14: It will come down to the wire for the Oakland Athletics. This is the team that was simply dominant throughout the season until August, and now they are fighting for a wild card spot in the playoffs. The A's are leading in the clubhouse over Kansas City and Seattle, but nothing is assured at this point. However, if Oakland can win out, or at least avoid losing ground, then they can make the playoffs. And, quite frankly, many people are hoping to see Oakland and Detroit battle once again in the playoffs. We will know in a week., 32055=Despite a recent hot streak, the Oakland Athletics still find themselves five games out of first place with a 54-45 record and will need to continue their hot hitting if they want to catch the first place Texas Rangers. Josh Reddick has been an offensive force for the A's so far this year, putting together a .271 batting average to go alone with 22 home runs and 49 runs batted in. He also boasts a strong .349 OBP so far this season. Outside of good numbers from Reddick and Yoenis Cespedes, the A's have struggled offensively throughout the year and rank near the bottom of the league in runs, batting average, on base percentage and slugging percentage heading into August., 35173=While the team currently sits among the worst in baseball in every major offensive category, the Oakland Athletics have managed to scrape together 8 wins so far on the young season and are in second place in the American League West. Newcomer Yoenis Cespedes leads the team in batting, home runs and runs batted in with a .254 clip, 4 HR's and 15 RBI's. Veteran Bartolo Colon has stepped in and been masterful so far this year, pacing the squad with a 2.54 earned run average and 3 victories so far. The team will compete in series against the Chicago White Sox and the Baltimore Orioles to finish off their April schedule., 37626=Oakland Athletics tickets ensure that fans see the Athletics playing top contenders throughout the entire MLB season. The A's are looking for 2011 to be the year they take control of a competitive American League West. With matchups with great teams like the Texas Rangers and the Los Angeles Angels and non-divisional meetings with the San Francisco Giants and New York Yankees throughout the season, the A's will have plenty of opportunity to test themselves against top talent in 2011. Be a part of this great tradition and don't miss the action!, 36461=Oakland Athletics tickets allow fans the opportunity to experience one of Major League Baseball's teams on the rise. The A's, established in 1901 but based in Oakland since 1968, have won nine World Series championships to go along with 15 AL pennants. The A's play at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum and have called it home since the park opened in 1964. The park also has one of the smallest capacities in the MLB at only 35,000 seats.}",
