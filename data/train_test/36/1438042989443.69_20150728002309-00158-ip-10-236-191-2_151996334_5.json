You must be Have your say... -- Dale Manning, Carthage, NY I bought my carving tools about six years ago, but haven\u2019t used them steadily so I\u2019m pretty much a newbie too. I bought a Ramelson set based off some reviews I found at the time and the price. They have worked well for me, but since I\u2019ve never had one of the top name carving tools, I wouldn\u2019t know the difference. They are US made, hold an edge well, and do what I need them to do, plus they are inexpensive. Here is the link. I bought the long handled set. Just click on the picture for more info and price. http://www.chippingaway.com/woodcarving/RamelsonWoodcarvingTools/RamelsonCarvingTools.htm #12 posted 12-11-2009 04:01 AM 949 posts in 2355\u00a0days home | projects | blog DaleM",
