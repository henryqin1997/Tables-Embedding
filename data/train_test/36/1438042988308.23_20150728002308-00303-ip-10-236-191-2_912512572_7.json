            "This place is great if you like the small town feel. Also if your an outdoors person. It's really nice out here in the fall.",
            "Definitely come visit before you decide to come here. You'll know once you're here if you'll like it.",
            "Probably one of the more cheaper schools in North Carolina. I certainly enjoy getting my education for not as pricey as other school.",
            "Sure it's a small school, but you'll get over it. Seeing as it's smaller you'll be able to see and know more people around campus. There are lots of activities going on every week so there's always something to do. It's also not too far to towns nearby if you need to get out.",
            "Most of my classes are really small, so that leads to a better student-teacher relationship. All of my professors this semester are very knowledgeable and cool, which makes for class being more fun."

There are call boxes everywhere on campus where you can call the campus police if you feel unsafe. There are also cat trans that drive around campus till 2:00 am and will drop you off anywhere on campus., 464221=I will tell you the truth and you may either love it or decide that this school is not for you. Personally, I love Western and I wouldn't want to attend college anywhere else. Western Carolina University, is located in Cullowhee. There is nothing in college except for the college, a gas station, a bar, and apartments. We had a few restaurants off campus, but they were burnt down this year unfortunately due to a kitchen fire. They are working on rebuilding the restaurants, and they will be ready by 2016. Outside of Cullowhee, is this town called Sylva. There is a lot of places to eat in town but mostly fast food restaurants. You will find a Walmart, banks, Ingles, Food lion, a bowling alley, a small movie theatre, and small shops. Downtown is kind of fun, if you want to spend the day walking around, going to a coffee shop, and just relaxing. So the question is what to do for fun. You have to make great friends, this will come easy because the school is small. You'll probably go to many bon-fires with your friends, off of campus. You may spend your night by a fire, laying on a hammock, and grilling out. You'll go hiking, and when I say hiking I mean vigorous hiking. A lot of the trails are for experienced people but there is also a lot of easy ones. There is a total of seven near by waterfalls that you can find, and go on an adventure while you are there. You'll go to college sporting events and show your catamount pride. Our football team may not be the best, but were pretty much great at every other sport. You'll probably spend a lot of time looking at each other figuring out what to do. Small parties are more popular here than huge parties. If your over 21, you will probably go to the bar a lot. If your under 21, you better be careful and not get caught under age drinking! There are many parties, but you will figure out which ones are safe and which ones are not. A lot of people join Greek Life to make friends and have stuff to do. You don't have to join Greek Life in order to be involved in school, but if you have a hard time making friends I would do it. You'll also probably visit places like Cherokee (15 min away) and Gatlinburg (45 min away)., 108885=The dining hall is fairly new, it was finished in 2009. Upstairs all you can eat, downstairs Asian, Mexican, burgers, McAlisters, and of course Starbucks. In the University Center we also have Papa Johns, Chick-fil-a, and Einsteins., 68261=Absolutely love greek life! Western's greek life has grow so much over the years and I believe it has gotten better every year. I am a sister of Alpha XI Delta, I went greek in fall 2011 and it has changed my life so much! For the better, of course. Greek life offers so many new opportunities for students and gets you involved in not only school functions but the surrounding counties.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students outdoor people, education majors, people interested in marching band (number 1 in the nation! :)) Tips for prospective students Come visit us! It isn't the same to just read a review, gain experience! Walk around campus with a tour guide that can tell you anything you want to know and some fun facts that you'll always remember. Bang for the buck My favorite part of tuition cost is the book rental policy. For $107, you get ALL the books you need for a semester. And you can return them at the end, so you don't have books you don't need sitting around. If you want, you can pay a discounted price to keep a book you want. This is one of Western's most exciting offers. Am enjoying being here I love being in the mountains and Western is located in the perfect setting. Located in a valley, we get perfect weather most of the year. We have a small campus so it is easy to find your way around and you won't feel completely overwhelmed on your first day. Am learning a lot The class size average is about",
