Not all but most color films newer than \u00a01990 are accelerated without any additional fees. Sometimes newer films that have been stored in hot condition, won\u2019t lend themselves well to acceleration and we won\u2019t do it. On the other hand, sometimes very old films that happened to have been in a cool place are accelerated without additional fees (such as the photo above). If you have an older film, and are curious of how the film may have come out in color \u2013 or if you are interested in very distressed looking color images, this can be a good option. There is no guarantee though that there will be anything to salvage in color. B&W is always the safest approach. With our \u201caccelerate film regardless of the condition of the B&W version of the film\u201d, you will get a B&W version of your pictures and if acceleration works on your film a color version as well in your gallery., 43066=Well\u2026we just made up the term so I guess we can also define it.\u00a0This is a picture with a pixel dimension and a level of compression that allows for fast uploading to various social media sites such as Facebook, Flickr and Twitter. \u00a0They are also small enough to easily e-mail to friends and family. \u00a0How large they appear on your screen is dependent on where you have your screen resolution set but they will fill one fifth to one third of your average screen. \u00a0The pixel dimension for a image with a 2:3 aspect ratio (same as most 35mm film frames) is 864 x 576 pixels, for a square picture (126 and many roll films) is 705 x 705 pixels. \u00a0While you might be able to squeeze an \u201cacceptable to some\u201d snap shot sized print out of these, they are too small for what would normally be considered enough resolution for this purpose., 55695=These films were manufactured pre-1984 and are a minimum of 25 years beyond the process before date on the original packaging. The availability of one of the chemical components required to process these films properly into color is dwindling (worldwide). In an effort to conserve our reserve of the chemical, we have had to raise the price per roll., 8373=http://www.filmrescue.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/BW-to-color1.jpg, 6355=Only film that we suspect, by the condition of the B&W version of the picture, might come out well in color do we choose to accelerate. In the above case, the B&W version of the picture is clearer, more like a new B&W film. The color version may too have some appealing aspects to it to some people. For instance, with Kodacolor-X, a film made from 1963 to 74, only a small percentage have film acceleration done to them.}",

Good\u00a0\u2014 The pictures aren\u2019t perfect but they are completely acceptable. They may appear grainier than a normal new film. Fair\u00a0\u2014 Pictures are clear and easy to look at but not perfect. They may be lower contrast and have problems with blemishes and edge fogging. Poor\u00a0\u2014 You can easily identify people and places but the images are very harsh and grainy. Very Poor\u00a0\u2014 You can for the most part make out what is on the film but identifying people can be a challenge. Scale: Following the film is a percentage of this type of film that comes out as recognizable and the quality trend for that film. Keep in mind, the quality trend is only a trend \u2013 some will be better and some worse. Our lab notes which give us guidance on the best way to process a given film has a database with an excess of 350 unique film types. The following is a list of the most common films that we develop on a regular basis. If you approach us with a film that is a current process we will first determine from you whether you need us or not. Most films that are only expired by 5 or 6 years or so will come out ok processed by a reputable",
    "textAfterTable": "Q?How are your processing techniques different than a normal lab? A. We keep very careful records on how a specific film is responding in a specific process. None of our processes are the same as what was originally intended for the film. All have been modified and tailored to our past experience with each film type, brand and format. The original process is not at all appropriate for salvaging images from long expired film. In order to salvage the best possible image from a film, many of these processes result in a Black & White image even though it may be a color film. In our opinion it is better to get a higher quality image in Black & White than a lower one in color or alternately to get something recognizable in Black & White than nothing in color. Q?Why does it take so long to get my pictures or film back? A. Normal turn around time is as short as 4 weeks and as long 10 weeks during a\u00a0particularly busy cycle\u00a0. We have found nothing more difficult to improve on and nothing that has caused more client dissatisfaction. Unlike a normal processing lab that may have one or two large volume processes under their roof we have 12 small volume processes. This creates",
