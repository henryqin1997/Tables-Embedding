If Jack Johnson devoted time to traveling the world, he might end up sounding something like Rudd. Also notable: Rudd is known for his skill with multiple instruments - simultaneously. Don't be surprised if you see him playing both the acoustic guitar and the didgeridoo at the same time. But that's just what you get when place as much emphasis on diversity in music as Xavier Rudd does. White Moth were nominated for Best Blues and Roots Album at the ARIA Music Awards, although neither ended up winning. Regardless, Rudd is now an international name. He frequently plays Bonnaroo Music Festival, and in 2007, was voted World's Sexiest Vegetarian Celebrity by PETA. For this reason, make sure to get your Xavier Rudd tickets. Not only is he an excellent musician, but he is also",
