Antibiotics in Laboratory Medicine, 4th edition, Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD, 1996., 53267=Doxycycline levels in GCF peaked (~1,500 \u00b5g/mL and ~2000 \u00b5g/mL for Coe-Pak\u2122 and Octyldent\u2122 groups, respectively) 2 hours following treatment with ATRIDOX\u00ae. These levels remained above 1000 \u00b5g/mL through 18 hours, at which time the levels began to decline gradually. However, local levels of doxycycline remained well above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) for periodontal pathogens (\u2264 6.0 \u00b5g/mL)2 through Day 7. In contrast, subjects receiving oral doxycycline had peak GCF levels of ~2.5 \u00b5g/mL at 12 hours following the initial oral dosing with levels declining to ~0.2 \u00b5g/mL by Day 7. High variability was observed for doxycycline levels in GCF for both oral and ATRIDOX\u00ae treatment groups.}",
