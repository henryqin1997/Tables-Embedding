Variations and modifications will be readily apparent to those skilled in the arts of ultrasound imaging or computer graphics. All such variations and modifications are intended to be encompassed by the claims set forth hereinafter. The method shown in FIG. 8 can be applied to B-mode intensity data or to color flow velocity or power data for the data volume of interest retrieved from the cine memory. Each pixel in the projected image includes the transformed intensity data and the transformed velocity or power data derived by projection onto a given image plane. In addition, at the time when the cine memory was frozen by the operator, the CPU 42 optionally stores the last frame from the XY memory 18 at multiple successive addresses in section 24B of cine memory 24. The projected image data for the first projected view angle is written into the first address in cine memory section 24B, so that the projected image data in a region of interest is superimposed on the background frame. This process is repeated for each angular increment until all projected images are stored in cine memory section 24B, each projected image frame consisting of a region of interest containing transformed data and optionally a background perimeter surrounding the region of interest consisting of background frame data not overwritten by region-of-interest transformed data. The background",
