            "I've been on campus for 4 years. It's safe. Just don't do stupid things and think before you act. Basically be smart about walking home at night.",
            "The Greek life has a pretty good rep here. They are always looking to get people involved and are always asking for new people.",
            "There are a lot of clubs...so many I can't list them all. You have Hall Council, RHA, NRHH, Care Bears, FAC, FAB...a lot of on campus things. You have Friends of Rachel too.",
            "Students who like anime go to the anime club. Students who are artistic go to AGIA meetings. Students who love getting involved go to your hall's Hall Council, RHA, NRHH. For ones who want to do community service get involved with Care Bears and Student Community Servies in the Student Union building.",
            "When it comes to tradition each hall can have traditions like Old Main Haunted House. Bear Feast is huge in the spring. Also Humans Vs Zombies is large among a lot of students.",
            "Kutztown over all is great. Again is more what you put in is what your get out. It's all about involvement.",
            "For fun get to know your Community Assistant, they know a lot of things to do. There is Bear Feast every Spring. There are campus events. There is cool shops (The Attic) and great food (Mama's).",
            "Food is good if you know where to look. South Dinning Hall burger place. There is great coffee for those all nighters. And Student Union Sub is one of the best place to get food.",
            "Again it all in how much you want to get out of it. If you sit in your room dorm life will suck but if you look pass your door you will find amazing people. Students should get to know their Community Assistant, if they have a freshmen mentor, and building director. Also get involved with student organizations such as RHA and Hall Council those places can take you far.",
            "It all depends on your teacher, your course level, and how much effort you want to put in. You get out what you put in. There is a lot to learn in the classes if you really want to learn it and utilize your professors. There are a lot of passionate and intelligent professors here.",
            "For students your need to get involved. Do not sit in your room. Go to hall council, get to know your housing staff and most importantly get to know yourself.",
            "Kutztown University is an amazing school that has many opportunities. Finding your niche here is easy just look a bit pass your resident hall door and you will find friendly faces. It is safe and there is a decent amount to do with student involvement and clubs."

The shuttle runs from 7:30 am till 4pm on week days and from 7:30 am till 3 am on Thursday through Saturday, in case you need to get somewhere safely! The doors to all dorms need to be swiped into with your ID so strangers will never be able to get into the building, and the rooms all have locks and dead bolts so your stuff is safe when you leave!, 118933=we have a festival called bear fest, which has been going on for about 35 years now. in april towards the end of the semester, there is a week long outdoor festival and all of the events are free. the tradition is that on tuesday night, there is a pudding slide. yeah, i said it. pudding slide. there are about 500 gallons of chocolate and vanilla pudding laid out on tarps and students can slide down them, all covered in pudding. great fun, and really fun to watch., 95182=My one tip is to do your work. I'm currently a sophomore and i realized just this year how much it takes to keep yourself going. Everyone thinks that Freshman year you can do whatever you want, but keep in mind that your freshman year impacts the rest of your college career just as much as any other year. Another thing, if you guys are looking to talk to new students just like you join this group, its for incoming freshman, class of 2016!! https://www.facebook.com/groups/227049750681385/, 425061=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
