            "I personally did not live on campus, but the students who do seem to be favored more, they also do better since they have access to everything.",
            "My tips would be to actually stay ahead and learn time management.",
            "Overall, I know that I personally could not stand the atmosphere of Ohio University and it just did not fit my personality. I would only recommend Ohio University if you plan to live on or close to campus and you have someone paying your college. I do love the campus, but use www.ratemyprofessor.com before scheduling any classes, it helps A LOT."

The 110 performs at all football and basketball games (men and women). They have performed around the world; from Rome and Ireland in 2013 to being invited to perform in China during the 60's. Along with the band though, the university's sports have been performing extremely well over the past few years, including 5 straight bowls for the football team, and a recent Sweet 16 run for the men's basketball team. There are other events that happen on Court Street in Athens, the craziest 1/2 mile in all of Ohio. Home to over 20 bars and a ton of restaurants, there is always something to do in Athens, Ohio!, 339987=I am not familiar with a lot at this time since school just started this week but there is a March 110 that takes all the incoming freshman. The band plays and marches across the main campus bridge with freshman class following them. It is really cool!, 645160=Halloween is HUGE at Ohio University. Rated the best campus to be on in the United States on Oct. 31st.}",

There are so many groups, clubs, and other students here, that anyone can find what they are looking for. Tips for prospective students For those of you thinking of coming here to OU here are a few tips: 1. GO TO CLASS. This is probably the most important thing to do because, now that we are on our own, we have many distractions and fun things to do. However, you are here to get an education and the best way to do that is going to class. 2. Study: To do well on test and exams, do your work and study so that you will be prepared. Also by study you will most likely get better grades, making your parents happy and keeping you off academic probation. Bang for the buck",
