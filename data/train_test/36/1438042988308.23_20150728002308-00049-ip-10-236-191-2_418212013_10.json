The color issue isn't a deal breaker for me - I bought the camera to work on basic photographic skills - depth of field control, getting correct exposures, learning how different focal lengths affect images. With the set up as recommended by others, contrast, etc. seems good enough for what I want to do. Can't do a lot of pp right now anyway due to a shoulder issue, Snapseed will be it for the time being. For the bargain price",
