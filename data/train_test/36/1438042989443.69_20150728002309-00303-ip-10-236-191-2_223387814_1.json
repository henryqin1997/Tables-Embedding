From: Fulko <fwes@li...> - 2005-01-24 10:33:37 Hello, I'm not sure if this is the right place, but I must start somewhere. I use glut in Python on GNU/Linux. Recently I upgraded my Debian system, and this upgrade included freeglut. In the old situation I could use the degree symbol, \\xb0. The freeglut library shows all characters up to 127, but refuses to show any character above 127. I contacted the Debian package maintainer, but his help did not resolve the problem. I looked through the source, and to me it looks like the degree symbol could be available. Can someone tell me if the degree symbol is available, and can be used on GNU/Linux by (Python): s='\\xb0' glutBitmapCharacter(GLUT_BITMAP_HELVETICA_18,s) Thanks, Fulko Showing 1 results of 1 Flat | Threaded",
