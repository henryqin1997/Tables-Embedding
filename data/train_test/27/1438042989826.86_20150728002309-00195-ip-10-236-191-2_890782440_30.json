            "Although the police is always campus and the student may see them, most students do not realize how important their presence is. I was personally evacuated from the Biology building as there had been a gas leak. The police were there within seconds helping with the evacuation and making sure everybody was safe.",
            "UTT offers a great variety of different clubs and activies. Whether you want to be involved in fighting against cancer or simply enjoy ultimate frisbee there is a place here for you. There are also many activities around campus usually from little to no cost to the student. These include some lectures at the Cowan Center or movie nights sponsored by CAB.",
            "UTT is perfect for those students that are looking for a top notch education and do not have thousands of dollars to be spending around. Who says that a good education has to cost a fortune? UTT offers great degrees (especially in chemistry and nursing) at an affordable cost. It also isn't an extremely large university, which guarantees a closer relationship with your professors. At a bigger university the student may find himself sitting in a 200 person class in which the professors does not (and does not want to) know his students. Here at UTT you will be able to personally visit with your professors without feeling awkward whatsoever.",
            "UTT is not an expensive university, either in terms of tuition or simply a quick coffee at Starbucks. In the University Center you will find different food and dining options. There are also a wide variety of vending machines (for snacks and drinks) all over campus as well as various Starbucks stations. Nevertheless, the best bang for the buck is not limited to just satisfying the munchies. Some classes require you buy specific items (i.e. lab notebooks, goggles, etc.). While buying at your local store these items would be quite expensive, there are organizations all over campus (i.e. the ACS) that will sell the exact same items at an incredibly cheaper prize!",
            "UTT has a long list of student organizations that satisfy every need within the student population. From looking for a fraternity, model UN, or simply playing chess there is a guarantee you will find an organization you enjoy. Some of them are national chapters and allow for not only a university membership, but a nationally recognized one as well.",
            "The food and dining services at UTT are quite admirable. For a university that is not huge in size (as compared to UT Austin), UTT enjoys a wide variety of food options from a quick salad or snack to full meals for the hungry patriots.",
            "I do not live in a dorm, but out of all my friends that do I have never heard a single complaint.",
            "Although a smaller name university than Rice, UTT still requires the student to be fully prepared and focused in his or her studies. Just like any other university, UTT will place a very high value on education, and if the student does not enjoy putting time into his or her education, they will not be successful.",
            "Make sure you know where your classes are before your first day and HOW to get there, you do not want to end up running from class to class! Get involved, get involved, get involved! There is no better way to succeed in your career. Through different activities you will meet a grand variety of people, and make life lasting friendships.",
            "I feel right at home at UTT; all of the teachers make me feel extremely welcome. The student atmosphere radiates a positive environment. Here no student is ever left behind."

Am enjoying being here The campus itself is beautiful, especially in the late summer months and early fall. The campus housing is close to wherever you need to go, and is quite convenient. Personally, I enjoy the classes, and campus itself. The staff members around the school are friendly and helpful as well, creating a more enjoyable environment. Am learning a lot I have only taken a semester of school at the University of Texas at Tyler, and the classes are all",
