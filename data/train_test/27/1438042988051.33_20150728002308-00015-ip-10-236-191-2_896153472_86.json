            "The fact that this university is located in the heart of Philadelphia speaks for itself. Students have many options including but not limited to shows, concerts, restaurants, shopping, and recreational activities. Students are encouraged to explore the city on their own or with friends during their first year at Drexel.",
            "Dining options range from Starbucks to Chick-fil-A to the Handschumacher Dining Hall. Meal plans allow students to choose from a variety of healthy meals during the week that are prepared by the talented dining hall staff.",
            "Students have the options of traditional dorm housing or suite-style housing as freshmen. The residence halls are well-maintained, safe, clean, and conveniently located near academic buildings, dining halls, and the library.",
            "Drexel's programs of study are very academically rigorous. The university operates on a ten-week quarter system, so it is important for students to hit the ground running when it comes to school work. If a student is struggling, he or she must immediately make an effort to seek assistance from other students, staff, and professors. The co-op programs demand high levels of workplace competence and commitment.",
            "It is important that admissions sees an academically strong applicant made evident by grades, GPA, and high SAT scores. To supplement that, however, applicants must demonstrate competence by the participation in extracurricular activities, volunteer work, athletics, and work experience. A strong application essay is also carefully reviewed by admissions staff.",
            "Drexel is a wonderful, career-oriented university located in the heart of bustling Philadelphia, PA. The programs at Drexel are tailored to fit the needs of students wishing to pursue a variety of degrees, especially in the areas of science and business. The co-op education program that Drexel offers is known worldwide and gives graduates a competitive edge when it comes to applying for employment after graduation."

A group tour might be ok if you want to see the campus, but not if you want to try to get to know the campus. Plus, a student will be able to give you a more personal insight into their experiences. With all of that in mind, be aware that the way Drexel operates is in terms or a quarter system. The average college has two semesters of around 14 or 16 weeks and a summer break. Drexel's freshman year consists of three 10 week terms equal to that of a semester and summer term off. The credits you earn on the quarter system are sometimes looked as unequal to those on a semester system by other colleges, so if you ever want to transfer it might be very difficult to do. The workload is very intense being 10 weeks as opposed to 16. Also, Drexel starts and ends later than most colleges. Drexel begins Fall term near the end of September, and Spring term ends around the second week of June, much like most high schools. Good luck on your searching!, 2340=Right now, I am on summer vacation. I cannot wait to go back to Drexel in September. Drexel's campus is filled with fun clubs, organizations, and there's always something to do. If you tire of being on campus, the heart and soul of Philadelphia, Center City, is a short, (free) shuttle ride away., 136741=File FAFSA in January, and you will automatically get $1000 in aid from Drexel., 591407=The top floor of our main buildings has this one room that surely hasn't been touched since 1980. There's all this old tech stuff forgotten up there, which is cool to see. I always want to explore that floor more, I have a feeling there's alot more history to be found., 379117=Not so much on campus but Philadelphia has the Mummer's parade every New Year's and has a great Welcome America for fourth of July., 821129=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 747539=If you're up for the challenge, the opportunities are here at Drexel. If your interested in research, check out the STAR program for incoming freshmen. It's a paid summer internship with housing. For anyone considering attending Drexel, I would contact the department you would be considering for your major. I set up an appointment with the Electrical Engineering department when I went on the campus tour. I met with a professor and an adviser, they were great. They explained how the program worked, spoke about Drexel in general and answered all the questions my parents and I had . They gave us contact information that we used later for followup questions via email and telephone. Checkout the COOP program,COOP is what makes Drexel different. Freshman year started in 9/2012, all freshman are required to take classes to prepare for COOP. In 12/2013 I interviewed with 4 companies, got job offers from 3 and just started(3/31/14) a 6 month full-time position with SAP Solutions (the 4th largest software company in the world). It's an unbelievable opportunity. Even more unbelievable is that I get paid (I think alot), they offered me benefits, health insurance, 401K. I'm excited to learn and contribute. The other tip is something I heard from student at every school I looked at. GET INVOLVED and do it right away... club, sports, Greek life, work study job, student government, newspaper, pep band, anything.}",

Tips for prospective students In high school, work hard and get involved. Drexel University is looking for students with good grades and those that take leadership roles. If you get accepted into Drexel, I suggest to take advantage of the 5 year program, which gives you the most working experience. If you are stressed out about the price of the school and you live within commuting distance, don't be afraid to commute. I am a commuter and I feel that I still get the college experience while saving a lot of money. Bang for the buck The reason I give Drexel five stars in this category is",
