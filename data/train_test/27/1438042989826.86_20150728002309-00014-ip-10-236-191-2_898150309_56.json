            "campus safety is 5 stars. the campus has many blue emergency posts every few feet so that you can press for any emergencies. there is also the cal poly police department and an individual number you can keep in your cell phone in case of an emergency and they will be there. safety is not an issue at all.",
            "i have not joined any sororities but from the pictures i see of my friends in their greek life, they seem to be enjoying themselves. it is sincere sisterhood and safe to join the greek life.",
            "there are so many diverse clubs and activities on campus from clubs for different majors, ethnicity, religion, etc. there are always fun activities to get involved in and it would be impossible not to find something that suits an individuals taste.",
            "honestly, it's a great place for everyone because the campus is diverse. academic wise, it would be great for engineering and architecture majors because it is one of the top schools. everyone would easily fit in and feel a sense of belonging.",
            "you can climb to the cal poly sign on top of the hill or visit the beautiful, cool (temperature and visual wise) japanese garden.",
            "if you dorm at cal poly, you get the gym membership for free and there is something always going on. importantly, the campus is very safe with the police department near by and the blue emergency stations every few feet just in case there is an emergency. you can't help but feel the positive vibe and it's just a great place for education and the college experience!",
            "you can also go climb the hills to the cal poly sign or go play in the game room. if you want to go out and have fun, there is diamond bar a couple of minutes from cal poly as well as raging waters on those heated days. if you want to relax, go to the japanese garden and see the turtles and coy fish. if you get lucky, you might get to see little ducks!",
            "again, i speak from the experience i had when i had freshmen orientation but the food was scrumptious. the plates and all utensils are very clean and the food is freshly made. there are a variety to choose from such as salad from the salad bar or american food, mexican food, italian, etc. ice cream for dessert is an a+ especially on those hot summer days.",
            "i commute so i don't know too much about the dorm life itself but from my experiences of dorming for 2 nights 3 days for freshmen orientation, the dorm was clean as well as the bathrooms and ac worked just fine. there are also pool tables as well as a tv downstairs in the lounge to relax with friends.",
            "what do you expect? it's college. it might not be stanford or berkeley but cal poly has rigorous classes. don't let that bother you too much. the professors are happy to help you if you just go out of your way to ask for that extra help.",
            "make sure to come to school with an open mind and a great attitude. know that you are coming here not only to have fun and make great memories, although that is very important, getting an education and graduating is your goal. get involved on campus and meet great people which will help you get connected to the real world after graduating.",
            "cal poly pomona is an outstanding school especially for engineering, architecture, business, hotel management majors and even more. the campus itself is very clean, serene, and safe. the students and teachers/ staff especially are very helpful and friendly."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{178558=I am an African American, and being here made me realize that I am really one of less than 1000 Black students attending this school. It was a major culture shock to see no one in my class look like me, and it is still something I am not used to yet. My advice for other Black students would be to find other black students on campus. Everyone is in the same situation you are in so you don't have to feel alone. Don't only hang out with your specific race, but make sure you can count on them to understand how you're feeling., 322749=Dorm doesn't cost as much as other universities. Can even live in a single dorm for 12000 bucks a year. Also there are buses and shuttles if you don't have a car. And there is many places to see and love., 174124=If you commute, it's roughly $2000 per quarter, and if you dorm, roughly $5000. That's really good, considering that there are so many other schools that are much more expensive, but have the same quality of education. Cal Poly churns out brilliant students and many of them do get hired in their industry because this school has so many great programs. So a top-notch quality education, with a high guarantee for being hired because of the great programs, at only $2000-5000? Why not?, 826105=In comparison to UCs and Out of State Schools the Cal-State Tuition is Very well priced. I'm a commuter, so I don't pay for rent or dorms making my tuition especially low. I think I pay right around $2000 a quarter for Tuition, which comes out to about $6000 a year if you don't do Summer Session. Summer classes tend to be Very expensive because the government doesn't fund us well for Summer Classes. Books are reasonable, if you rent. Rent from anyone, Amazon, Chegg you name it. It's always cheaper than the on campus Book Store. Personally I'm not a believer in the big-name college. So just in general, I'd like to think I'm getting the same education that my friends that are going to UC's are, but at a cheaper price. Also CPP is California PolyTECHnic University at Pomona, which means we're all about hands-on education. For example, as a Hospitality Major one of my classes is working at the on campus restaurant or hotel for a quarter. I'm also required to have 800+ hours of Professional Work Experience in order to get my degree. Cal Poly also hosts job fairs, their own Career Center and an online job board to help you with your resume or set you up with different job opportunities. So if you look at it that way, I think we're just as good as any UC. It's also not about What school you go to it's about what you Do there... That's the big idea., 135358=Though Pomona isn't the safest city in the area ironically I feel really safe on campus. Taking a night class for the first time and getting out between 9:00-9:30 pm I was shocked to see how many students were still on campus. The great thing about having classes after 5:30 pm is that students are able to park in the faculty parking lots which is much closer to the classrooms making it much safer for the students., 702814=Poly Nights, clubs, campus sports, game rooms and looking forward to the 3 level recreation center which will be completed in 2014. Also the Rose Bowl Float is a big event on campus., 665296=Tuition has been steadily rising since I have been enrolled in Cal Poly Pomona and my friend, a junior, has told me that the total tuition for one quarter used to be less than $1000 when he was a freshman...whereas now it is over $2000. Lots of services are included in tuition fees, such as access to the wellness center, but most students don't take advantage of such services anyway. The only consolation for blowing away all of one's money on expensive textbooks, tuition, parking permits, etc. is that the money is going into a college degree., 884390=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 84694=It really is money efficient, tuition is about 2200 for a full time quarter but you take as many classes as you want to (within limits of 20 credits). So you can get done fast and efficiently., 760121=The Bronco Student Center is meant for students to relax and enjoy in between class. This is where our gym is located along with our games room and study rooms as well. There is also about 4 different food places. Opening in Fall 2014 we will have a recreational center that will several other things to do for fun on campus.}",

Also Cal Poly is very affordable at a tuition cost of around $4000 a year. Tips for prospective students Get involved with student organizations and clubs, they will make your college experience full and enjoyable with over 300 clubs, you can find one that suits you, if you cannot find one that is right for you, there is an option of creating it yourself. The dorms are pricey, cramped and old; it maybe better if you were to rent a house nearby with a group of friends or only dorm the first year. EOP is a great program, if you are low income, just read the requirements and check a box when you are applying it gives you some grant money each year, and opens up more a lot",
