            "Oberlin uses the blue light system that a lot of colleges use and requires swipe cards to gain access to any residential building. There is very little crime.",
            "Oberlin doesn't have Greek Life, which is generally considered a positive thing among students.",
            "Even though Oberlin is a small school, there seems to be a club or activity for everyone.",
            "Oberlin is great for liberal and/or open-minded students who care about the world around them.",
            "Oberlin is very expensive, like most small, private colleges. But it's also a really good school. The answer to this question really depends on the individual's value of money as compared to other things though.",
            "It's absurdly expensive, but the co-ops provide a good alternative to traditional dorms. Many upper-classmen also live in village housing, which is an independent apartment or house.",
            "Some of the larger dorms with no themes or other special characteristics don't have much in the way of community, but there are a lot of program houses, theme halls (such sci-fi hall and classics hall) and co-ops which have good community.",
            "Oberlin is a school that challenge its students academically while simultaneously engaging them. The professors are generally great and will work with you as needed. Students may stay up late studying and writing papers, but that's because they care about what they're doing."

The commitment to the student is extremely clear. My private teacher gives above and beyond the requirements for his students with additional lessons each semester, and a technique class for each freshman. In addition, the guest lecturers and artists giving concerts are educationally and financially worth an incredible price. Oberlin Conservatory has more Steinway pianos than anywhere in the world excluding the Steinway factory. This speaks to the type of equipment and resources with which the students work. The Conservatory Library never ceases to amaze me with the unreal amount of resources it provides. In addition to this, the orchestra tours and experiences are included in tuition. This year's tour to NYC in January is of no cost to the students participating. Oberlin provides a plethora of resources, highly renown faculty and guests, and will bend over backwards to provide what you need for your learning experience. Although Oberlin's tuition is extraordinarily high, this price reflects the incredible experiences and opportunities that await its students.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Stay overnight: you won't get a decent grasp on what the campus is like just hanging out for a few hours on a week day. Check out the Co-ops: Some people will tell you to avoid the Co-ops (especially Harkness) but its a great idea to go and see how they work and what they are all about. Talk to a lot of people: get as many perspectives on campus life as possible. Bang for the buck The school isn't cheap. If you're in need of financial aid, you'll have plenty of opportunity to find it, it's just a matter of looking. Otherwise, what you experience and learn here is totally worth the somewhat hefty price tag. Am enjoying being here The atmosphere on campus is amazing, especially if you are involved in the Co-op system. Living in a Co-op really sets you up with an incredible amount of connections to upperclassmen and people who are experienced with the campus. The campus itself is beautiful, and though Oberlin may seem like a small town in middle-of-nowhere-Ohio, the student body is really politically and socially active, making Oberlin a very exciting place to live. Am learning a lot The range",
