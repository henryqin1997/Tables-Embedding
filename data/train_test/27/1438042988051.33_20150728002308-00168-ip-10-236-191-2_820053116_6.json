This amount is not improved by your weapon skill, but is increased by relevant enchantments and perks. This effect is not considered an enchantment, so silver weapons can be enchanted like any normal unenchanted weapon, though they will always display the text for this effect and not for any enchantment that you may place on it. \u2021 All Daedric weapons can also be made at the Atronach Forge, in which case the Daedric Smithing perk is not needed, but instead the Sigil Stone must be obtained. Tempering weapons created at the Atronach Forge is still augmented by the Daedric Smithing perk. \u2020\u2020 Nord Hero weapons can only be created at the Skyforge, and only after the quest Glory of the Dead has been completed. \u2021\u2021 Although Skyforge Steel weapons cannot be forged, tempering them is still augmented by the Steel Smithing perk. \u2020\u2020\u2020 Forging Stalhrim weapons also requires completion of the quest A New Source of Stalhrim.
