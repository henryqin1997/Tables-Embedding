            "I know that my friends that are in Greek life love it. I know that they do a lot of community work on and off campus and they build a very strong support network from within. They love their brothers and sisters very much, and they do not discriminate against non-Greeks, they are inclusive of everyone.",
            "Schreiner is great for students that are driven and have an idea of what they want out of life. Also, if a student has a learning disability, Schreiner is great for them. Schreiner has Learning Support Services, and LSS tutors students that need the extra attention. There they can take tests at their own pace, and are provided notes that another student takes for them to make sure that they have all the material given by the professors.",
            "There is a tradition that the Thursday before Thanksgiving and Christmas they have a turkey dinner for lunch in the diner. Also the night before finals start, every semester they have a Mid-night breakfast. The professors and even the President of the school get together in the diner to cook breakfast for the students!",
            "I believe that Schreiner has a great bang for the buck because of the quality of the faculty and staff and the great job they do on promoting an atmosphere that is welcoming and great for learning. They also are great about finding scholarships and internships to help on the financial side of things.",
            "There are a ton of things to do on campus! There are different intra-mural sports each semester, such as flag football, a racquetball tournament, and dodge ball. We have a pool that is open in the warmer months, a really cool gym with two racquetball courts, tennis courts, soccer and baseball fields. We also have four Greek organizations on campus, and they are very involved in the community on and off campus. There are also several recognised student organizations that exist and there is an opportunity to start one if you desire a group that hasn't been started yet. The student activities board has a calender that has all the events that are happening on campus for the current month, and they also host events. A fun event to go to is called Comedy and Chocolate, it's a comedy show and they have a ton of different chocolate things to choose from to eat!",
            "The food at Schreiner is better than your average high school cafeteria. There is a grill line that stays the same everyday, an entree line that changes daily, a pizza bar, salad bar, pasta bar, and they set out different desserts everyday. I like the food, and I eat there for lunch and dinner everyday of the week and am happy with the selections. Thursdays are chicken fried steak day, yum!",
            "There are two freshman dorms on campus and the rest are for the upperclassmen. One of the freshman dorms is known for the residents being very friendly and social, and the freshmen that live in the other tend to be more studious than social. Every dorm has events for us to get together that are a lot of fun, and a great way to meet the other residents. I love to attend the events because they are a lot of fun, and as a perk the resident assistants generally bring food. There are opportunities to have your own room and bathroom, or to share a bathroom. All of the apartments on campus have fairly sized rooms, living rooms, kitchens, and depending on the complex one or two bathrooms. Lots of room to share.",
            "In all of the classes you will need to keep on top of your work and pay attention, but while some classes are difficult, they also have a study group that meets to go over the material. For example, the organic chemistry professor holds at least one extra class a week to review material. All the professors are very willing to work with students to help us understand the material or work around scheduling difficulties.",
            "I suggest to incoming students to keep focused on class work and studies before social life, it can be very easy to become sidetracked and fall behind. On the other hand, DO get involved in the Schreiner community and Kerrville community, it is a great place to be. Find a physical activity that you can do, that way you can network and have fun at the same time.",
            "Schreiner University is a great school to attend because the atmosphere between teachers and students is extremely helpful and engaging. Teachers know their students name and face, and will seek out students to engage them in discussion. The fantastic atmosphere is not limited to teacher-student relations, there is a great support network among the students as well."

Remember, you pay for your education so it need to be worth it. Tips for prospective students Be able to do your own work at your own time. It's a competition out there even if they don't say it. Study as much as you can. Don't delay it because you will end up with a low GPA. Don't be surprise not achieving an A because for some class you are lucky to get a C! Bang for the buck It's pricey for this university compare to some other colleges, but 90% of incoming students gets scholarship, including myself. The price is worth it because you get the extra help from professors and one-on-one attention; you are not just a",
