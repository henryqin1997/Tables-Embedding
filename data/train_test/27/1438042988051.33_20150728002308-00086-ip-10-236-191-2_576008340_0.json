These devices are used in studies regarding the evaluation of odour impact and have been compared with dynamic olfactometry or electronic noses [88], showing that Nasal Ranger field olfactometer is efficient at measuring livestock farm odour, and can provide consistent and accurate measuring results., 240501=In 1958 the U.S. Public Health Service sponsored the development of an instrument and a procedure for field olfactometry (a technique only suitable for ambient odour concentration measurements). The first field olfactometer, called scentometer, is a hand-held device that allows one to evaluate odours on site. A field olfactometer creates a series of dilutions by mixing the odorous ambient air with odour-free (carbon-filtered) air. The U.S. Public Health Service method defines the dilution factor as Dilution to Threshold, D/T. The Dilution-to-Threshold ratio is a measure of the number of dilutions needed to make the odorous ambient air non detectable.}",
