For more information about OCSP, see the description of RFC 2560 at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2560.txt., 3948=WebLogic Server offers limited support for Certificate Policy Extensions in X.509 certificates. Use the weblogic.security.SSL.allowedcertificatepolicyids argument to provide a comma separated list of Certificate Policy IDs. When WebLogic Server receives a certificate with a critical Certificate Policies Extension, it verifies whether any Certificate Policy is on the list of allowed certificate policies and whether there are any unsupported policy qualifiers. This release of WebLogic Server supports Certification Practice Statement (CPS) Policy qualifiers and does not support User Notice qualifiers. A certificate is also accepted if it contains a special policy anyPolicy with the ID 2.5.29.32.0, which indicates that the CA does not wish to limit the set of policies for this certificate., 1965=Use this option to ensure the Basic Constraints extension on the CA certificate is defined as CA and set to critical. This option enforces the IETF RFC 2459 standard., 93299=The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is an automated certificate checking network protocol that is defined in RFC 2560. As part of certificate validation, WebLogic Server queries the revocation status of a certificate by issuing an OCSP request to an OCSP responder. Certificate status is maintained by the OCSP responder. Acceptance of the certificate is suspended until the responder returns an OCSP response, indicating whether the certificate is still trusted by the CA that issued it., 3363=Oracle does not recommend using this option in a production environment. Instead, purchase new CA certificates that comply with the IETF RFC 2459 standard. CA certificates from most commercial certificate authorities should work with the default strong option.}",
