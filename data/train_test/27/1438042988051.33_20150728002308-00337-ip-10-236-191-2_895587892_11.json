            "Like most cities, New Haven has crime too. There is a strong police and campus police presence and I feel safe all the time. Many locked gates and levels of security.",
            "Available if you want it, but plenty of fun and interaction in each of the houses as well. It is easy to float socially between them.",
            "There is a club for seemingly everything. The hardest part is limiting yourself to 4-5 ;) and still be a dedicated full time student.",
            "Smart but outgoing and communicative. Yes, college is full of classes and labs, but a big part of the ongoing value will be the relationships that you foster and build in your four years. Yale is great in so many disciplines that there really is something for most anyone to pursue with quality and rigor.",
            "Too many to list with our long history. We all have our favorite spots to hang out or study. The tunnels between houses are always an adventure.",
            "It is a GREAT education with awesome average starting salaries and endless opportunities. 60% of students received an average of $41,350 (they would rate this at 5 stars). 40% of us get zero aid (less stars). The website aid calculator will give you a good guide, but assume you will get less. These are important family discussions. Do it up front BEFORE you apply as my family did. It is an investment in my future and we are all on board. Very happy here, no regrets.",
            "Too many clubs to mention. The house system (think Hogwarts) is fun and creates a smaller feel to the school. Plenty of activities on campus and beyond. New York City or Boston are reasonable speedy train rides away, with NYC only about 80 minutes.",
            "Very good food, freshman 15 here I come. Seriously, a variety of choices at multiple dining halls. Even late night snacks. I have never left hungry.",
            "The roommate sorting hat works well and I really enjoy my suite mates. We have enough in common to bond, yet enough differences to always add variety to each other's lives. We are from all over the country so it is great to see the world from the different vantage points.",
            "Challenging classes. The variety of class offerings is amazing. Too many great choices each semester with a limited amount of time to take them all. Multiple levels of advisors, so there is always someone to answer your questions.",
            "Volunteer, be active, have an opinion. Be ready to speak up, share your ideas, challenge others, find a new understanding. Take the hard classes in high school. Push yourself. Practice the discipline and work ethic of school that is necessary to be successful here. Fill your summers with educational pursuits and volunteerism. Read for the joy of discovery and to understand the world around you. We will have to fix the problems of the world in a few short years so start your preparations now!",
            "Yale is great place. The history, the students, the faculty are all terrific. There are multiple levels of student support, and we are very much a family. The sorting hat for roommates works great, and the list of outside speakers coming to campus could fill every night with a new and different experience. It enhances the overall experience of what you get from your studies and time at Yale."

Besides good grades and some extracurriculars/leadership, Yale really looks for students who are passionate about and have excelled in a certain field. My passion was art. For some it was music, and for some it was math competitions. In short, it's good to have some extra-curriculars and leadership, but in order to stand out, you need to have something that you're really passionate about and that you've excelled in. By excelled I mean things like teaching an art class or entering art competitons (if you're an artist) or if you're really interested in politics, maybe working on a local campiagn. Just find something that you can really delve into. This is what will separate you from people who only have a perfect SAT and GPA to go on., 38512=Food on campus is not bad, but the availability of late-night food is less than satisfactory. Dining halls close at 7:30, and this tends to be a problem for students who are up late. The only other options around campus (Gourmet Heaven and Durfee's) are ridiculously expensive. However, Downtown New Haven has some great restaurants. If money is not a factor, these are definitely great options., 79487=Yale is by far one of the most academically demanding institutions in the world. You will be pushed harder than you have ever be pushed before, and you will learn more than you have ever thought possible. But unlike other Ivy League schools, Yale has a healthy academic climate that will not burn you out. Yale's liberal arts curriculum will nurture your mind. You will get taught by some of the world's leading scholars, like historian John Gaddis, psychologist Paul Bloom, economist Stephen Roach, and law scholar Akhil Amar., 221509=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 95573=Looks like Yale's engineering program are very small with a high studnet to faculty ratio of 1:1 or 2:1}",

It isn't unheard of for very ambitious students to pile on 6 or even 7 at a time! Many classes will push you hard to master the material, but there are always a handful of courses that are more laid back. That is, you get as much out of them as you're willing to put in.
