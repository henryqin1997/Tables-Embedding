Science, Technology, and Human Values 9:63-71., 6436=Total expenditures for Melaleuca controls during 2003 were estimated at $10.87 Mn for park/preserve managers and $1.18 Mn by agricultural managers. Expenditures for Melaleuca control by resident households in 2003 were estimated at $13.21 Mn. In addition, costs for the TAME Melaleuca program in 2003 were $915 thousand., 1328=United States Department of Commerce-Bureau of Economic Analysis. 2006. Gross Domestic Product: Implicit Price Deflator. http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/data/GDPDEF.txt (Accessed February 2006)., 6104=The resulting benefit-cost ratio for Melaleuca control for all types of land use in 2003 was 1.76. The BC ratio for park/preserve lands was 1.29. The BC ratio for agricultural lands was higher (7.83) because these properties have the additional benefits of agricultural productivity and market value. Also, agricultural managers reported lower costs since they have not been treating Melaleuca as aggressively, and therefore have a greater marginal value at this stage of their control efforts., 2499=Florida Natural Areas Inventory (FNAI). 2005.

Cost-benefit Analysis: A Survey. The Economic Journal 75(300):683-735., 9053=Four equations were specified to capture the benefits of Melaleuca treatment/removal. Figure 1 shows the steps involved in the estimation of benefits. Park/preserve lands were evaluated for the benefits to ecological function and recreational benefits, while agricultural lands were evaluated for benefits to ecological function, agricultural productivity, and agricultural land market value. The average value of agricultural goods produced in the survey area was used as a proxy for agricultural productivity ($1,034 per acre), while the average market value of agricultural land ($7,017 per acre) was taken from the 2002 Agricultural Census (USDA-NASS 2002). The analysis accounted for the 23 percent average loss in recreational value of park/preserve land due to Melaeluca infestation as reported by professional park/preserve managers (Table 2)., 10661=In this study of benefits and costs of Melaleuca control, primary data were gathered through mailed surveys of professional land managers and resident households in 10 counties of south Florida during 2003 (see companion reports FE671 and FE672). This analysis was focused on valuing benefits to ecological function, agricultural productivity, agricultural land market value, and recreational benefits from Melaleuca treatments on public and privately held lands. Values reported in the survey were expanded to represent the population of agricultural managers in south Florida. It was assumed that benefits can only accrue in areas where Melaleuca was actually killed and that those benefits accrue immediately after treatment. In addition, it was assumed that treatments were 90 percent effective (Laroche and Taylor, pers. comm.)., 6955=The total benefits of Melaleuca control in south Florida in 2003 were estimated at $23.26 million (Mn), including $13.38 Mn for ecosystem function, $6.68 Mn for agricultural land markets, $2.15 Mn for agricultural productivity, $703 thousand for recreation, and $360 thousand for avoidance of fire damages (Table 3). Total benefits due to Melaleuca control on public lands in 2003 were estimated at $14.02 Mn, while benefits on private agricultural lands were estimated to be $9.24 Mn., 1717=Sassone, P.G., and W.A.Schaffer. 1978.
