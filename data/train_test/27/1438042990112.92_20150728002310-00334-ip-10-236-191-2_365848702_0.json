Homasassa and Crystal River both reportedly are having a banner year with scallops plentiful in many popular areas. To the north reports of scallop limits in just an hour or two are common. With inshore fishing waning this time of the year, scalloping is a great alternative to fishing in Florida's July heat. I have never really understood why this area is so good for raising clams, but the main scallop run always seems to avoid us. I guess you can't have it all., 28737=Trout: The trout bite experienced a slow start but then really got going good. Limits of slot trout (15-20 inches) have been common. April was the best month as usual and gave anglers an abundance of oversized over-the-slot fish. Excellent trout action continued right through June. July and august will be much tougher to find keeper fish as water temperatures soar. The trout get an A this semester in spite of a slow beginning., 38156=Copyright \u00a9 2015}",
