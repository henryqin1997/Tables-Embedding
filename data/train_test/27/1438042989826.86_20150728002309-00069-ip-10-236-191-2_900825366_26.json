            "There is always campus security running around on campus. There are also phones located throughout that will connect you to security and they will walk you to your vehicle if you need it.",
            "The people in the clubs are great and always wanting new members. Tracking the times down for meetings can be difficult but worth the effort if you have extra time on your hands to participate.",
            "If you are a student looking for a start to your college life than this is a great place. It offers all of the basics with a lower tuition cost. It even has some of its own programs so you can start and finish your major with them.",
            "Above the bookstore is a quiet area that gives you a view of the front of the school looking out and of the line that might be going for textbooks downstairs. The best thing about this spot is that it is usually quiet and is one of the two places on campus that plays music.",
            "The money I spend here allows me to get the same classes that I need at a four year college with the advantage that I am spending less than I would at that four year college.",
            "The campus has activities that it does once a week for students to participate in a learn new things. There are also many clubs that you can become a member of.",
            "The student caf\u00c3\u00a9' is a great place for a burger and their food always taste great. There is also a place to purchase an assortment of different coffees and drinks with a friendly atmosphere to enjoy your drink,yet still enjoy the company of other students.",
            "Dorm life is not something I participated in and did not see a lot of information on it. Hearing from other students it did not seem that it was all that bad.",
            "Classes are easy to follow and instructors are always willing to help. If you want to pass a class simply show up, do your work and you will be told everything you need to do to gain an understanding of what you are learning.",
            "Talk to an advisor. It may seem like you can figure things out on your own, and maybe you can, but advisors will know when to take classes and how different ones will get you to the place you want to be faster.",
            "Linn-Benton is a great place to begin. It has instructors that take the time to know your name and there are always places you can go for help. The student council is very active with students and putting on new events all the time."
