            "There are always campus police patrolling the area. They are very eaasy to contact as well (go to the Office of Public Safety ASAP to recieve a little booklet with essential numbers).",
            "There are plenty opportunities for students to find there place on campus from Greek Life to politics to outdoor activities.",
            "USD is on the pricey side, but there are students loans, private grants/scholarships, university grants/sholarships, and federal financial aid (if you qualify) to help pay for tuition, fees, room & board, and books.",
            "Pacific Beach, Mission Beach, and Sea World are about a 10 minute drive away from USD. You can also use public transportation to go anywhere in San Diego. USD has a tram serive that runs to Old Town about twice a day. There are an array of clubs downtown (if you're of age, or course), restaurnts throughout San Diego, and we have awesome taco shops throughout San Diego.",
            "USD has great food options. My personal favorites are La Paloma and Aromas Cafe. The food can be pricey though.",
            "I am a commuter student, but everyone I know who lives on campus say that they have made lifelong friends living on campus and there are a lot of activities going on for campus residents.",
            "Academic life at USD is definately tough, especially if you're a science, business, or math major. You will have to give up most of your social life for school, but it is worth it in the end. Remember: hard work does pay off.",
            "For sure, talk to an admissions counselor about applying as a transfer student or a new freshman. Bring all acadmeic transcripts with you when you go so that the counselor will know where you are academically and class wise (for transfers students who need specific classes done before transferring). Also look at the website for your intended major, look at what classes you need and what classes you'll want to get a head start on before transfering. Other than that, make sure you are studying well, have at least a 3.0 GPA, and have great relationships with some professors or teachers (recommendation letters).",
            "Most of the professors at USD are very passionate about teaching and helping students to succeed. If you haven't found your place, you will be sure to find your place somewhere as a part of the USD community. USD has awesome food, so when you're hungry you have great options."
