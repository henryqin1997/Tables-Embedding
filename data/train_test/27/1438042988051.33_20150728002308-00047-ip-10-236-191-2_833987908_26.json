Cindy F. | 05/30/2013 Read Full Review Owner cancelled the day of arrival. I reserved this property a month in advance and final payment was received days before my arrival. Unfortunately, I received a voicemail stating the owner had messed up the dates and the current renter wanted to stay longer...therefore my family had been moved to another location. The message was left while I was on the road to Ft. Walton. The new location was more expensive",
