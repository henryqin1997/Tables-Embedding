Showing Next \u00bb 5 4 3 2 1 Report this Comment I agree with Roy. On a different note Pro does not consider the unintended consequences of considering oneself an animal. I recently put a price on the value of my cat. It was $900. I was not going to spend that amount of money to keep it alive. I wounder who pro would allow to put a value on his/her life. Also not considered is a court of law. Are you an animal or are you a human. I am sure pro would immediately be a human in both cases and would not try to make the humans are animals argument in either case. sadolite 4 years ago Posted by",
