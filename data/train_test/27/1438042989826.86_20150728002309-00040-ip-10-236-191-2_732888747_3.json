            "Answer",
            "B. The permanent teeth start forming between birth and three years of age, and the mandibular central incisors are one of the first permanent teeth in the developmental sequence or order.",
            "C. The rounded elevations are mamelons and are evidence of lobe development in the development of teeth.",
            "A. There should be 12 molars in children approximately seven to eleven years of age: eight primary molars (four first and four second primary molars) and four permanent first molars.",
            "B. An overdeveloped and extended maxillary labial frenum may interfere with the development of contact between the maxillary central incisors; the space is called a diastema.",
            "C. A distal step of the second primary molars in centric occlusion always leads to a Class II or distal occlusion.",
            "D. During the first 25 mm of opening, the condyles rotate in the mandibular fossa.",
            "A. The mucobuccal fold is the \u201cgutter-like\u201d area in the vestibule located at the junction of the facial surfaces of the teeth, gingiva, and alveolar mucosa and the lining mucosa of the cheeks and lips.",
            "B. A heavy and tight lingual frenum may interfere with tongue movement and affect speech.",
            "A. The parotid papilla has an opening for the parotid salivary gland and the sublingual caruncle for the submandibular salivary gland; both glands are major salivary glands.",
            "D. The incisive papilla is a pad of tissue, located lingual to the maxillary central incisors; it overlays the incisive foramen in the maxillae and protects the nasopalatine nerve.",
            "B. Both statements are false. The pterygomandibular raphe appears as a ridge of tissue between the maxillary tuberosity and retromolar area; the ramus of the mandible is palpated lateral to the raphe.",
            "C. The interfurcal ceiling is the most crownwards portion of the furcation and is called the ceiling for both maxillary and mandibular teeth. Sometimes it is located more crownward than the furcation entrance.",
            "B. The CEJ is located at the meeting of the anatomic crown and the anatomic root.",
            "B. Mamelons are seen as three rounded eminences on the incisal ridge of newly erupted permanent incisors. They make the incisal ridge look scalloped and are a manifestation of incisor development.",
            "A. A cingulum is a linguocervical elevation or ridge found only on all anterior teeth.",
            "D. The primary mandibular left first primary molar is L in the Universal System and #7.4 in the ISO System.",
            "B max root trunks are longer than mand root trunks; max 1st premolar root trunks are generally at least one 1/2 the length of the root; max 1st molar root trunks are generally at least 1/3 the root length, and 2nd & 3rd molar root trunks are longer.",
            "C. A maxillary first permanent molar has three roots, two buccal and one lingual. The mesiobuccal and distobuccal roots are both approached from the buccal surface during instrumentation, and each root has a mesial surface.",
            "B. The CEJ on the facial surface of both maxillary and mandibular primary first molars is unevenly convex toward the cervical half with more apical convexity on the mesial half.",
            "A. A typical 7 year old will have the following perm teeth: mandibular centrals and 1st molars; mandibular lateral incisors and maxillary central incisors may be erupting. The erupted permanent incisors are succedaneous; the permanent molars are not.",
            "A. The location of the mesiobuccal cusp of the maxillary first permanent molar in relation to the mesiobuccal (buccal) groove of the mandibular first permanent molar is used in Angle\u2019s Classification of Malocclusion.",
            "C. To assess the centric occlusion of a five-year-old child, the terminal plane or terminus of the second primary molars in centric occlusion should be observed and classified as mesial step, distal step, or flush.",
            "A. Lateral movement, or excursion or deviation, is the movement of the mandible to the right or to the left during mastication. During lateral movement, the teeth on one side are working and those on the other are not working."
