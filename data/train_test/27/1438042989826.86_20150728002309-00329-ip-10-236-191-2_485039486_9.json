    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{79265=Referring now to FIGS. 4A-4K, a preferred method of forming the integrated power semiconductor device of FIG. 3A will be described. As illustrated best by FIG. 4A, the method begins with the step of forming a semiconductor substrate 10 by epitaxially growing a drift region 12 of first conductivity type (e.g., N-type) on a highly doped drain region 14 of first conductivity type that has a doping concentration greater than 1\ufffd1018 cm\u22123 therein. Computer controlled in-situ doping of the drift region 12 is also preferably performed during the epitaxial growth step so that the drift region 12 has a linearly graded (or step graded) first conductivity type doping concentration therein that decreases in a direction away from the drain region 14. In particular, the drift region 12 is preferably doped so that the doping concentration of the drift region 12 at the abrupt non-rectifying junction (J3) is greater than about 1\ufffd1017 cm\u22123 and more preferably about 3\ufffd1017 cm\u22123, but less than 5\ufffd1016 cm\u22123 at the first face 15 a and more preferably only about 1\ufffd1016 cm\u22123 at the first face 15 a., 70719=Referring now to FIG. 3B, a UMOSFET according to a second embodiment of the present invention will be described. In particular, a unit cell 200\u2032 of an integrated UMOSFET has a predetermined width \u201cWc\u201d (e.g., 1 \u03bcm) and comprises a highly doped drain contact layer 114 of first conductivity type (e.g., N+), a drift layer 112 of first conductivity type having a linearly graded doping profile therein and a transition region 117 of first conductivity type which may have a relatively high N-type doping concentration therein of about 1\ufffd1017 cm\u22123. As illustrated by FIG. 3B, the transition region 117 forms a non-rectifying junction with the drift layer 112 and the N-type doping concentration in the transition region 117 is higher than the N-type doping concentration in a portion of the N-type drift layer 112 that extends to the non-rectifying junction with the transition region 117., 80577=Referring now to FIG. 4B, a thin base region 16 is then formed in the substrate 10 by patterning a first implant mask (not shown) on the first face 15 a having an opening therein that exposes an active portion of the substrate 10. Second conductivity type dopants are then implanted through the opening in the first mask. The implanted second conductivity type dopants can then be diffused into the drift region 12 to an initial depth of about 0.5 \u03bcm, for example. These steps are then preferably followed by the steps of patterning a second implant mask (not shown) on the first face 15 a and performing an implant of first conductivity type source region dopants through the second mask. The second mask is also preferably patterned in a third dimension (not shown) so that portions of the underlying base region 16 do not receive the implanted source region dopants. These portions of the base region 16 that extend to the first face 15 a can be ohmically contacted by a source electrode at the end of processing. The implanted first conductivity type dopants and the second conductivity type dopants can then be diffused to a depth of about 0.5 \u03bcm and 1.0 \u03bcm, respectively, to provide a base region thickness \u201cTc\u201d of about 0.5 \u03bcm. Preferably, boron (B) is used as a P-type dopant and is implanted at a dose level of about 1\ufffd1014 cm\u22122 and at an energy of 100 keV. Arsenic (As) is preferably used as an N-type dopant and is implanted at a dose level of about 1\ufffd1015 cm\u22122 and at an energy of 50 KeV., 92627=Numerical simulations of the unit cell 300 of FIG. 5 were performed using a drift region doping concentration that increases from a value of 1\ufffd1016 cm \u22123 at a depth of 1 micron to a value of 2\ufffd1017 cm\u22123 at a trench depth (TD) of 5 microns. The thin portion of the gate electrode insulating region 124 had a thickness of 500 \u212b, the thick portion of the gate electrode insulating region 124 had a thickness of 3000 \u212b and the first field plate insulating region 134 had a uniform thickness of 3000 \u212b. Based on these parameters, the simulated potential contours were shown to be uniformly spaced in both the active and termination regions. The simulated current flowlines also indicated that breakdown would occur simultaneously in both the active and termination regions so long as the breakdown shielding region 117 is electrically connected to the source electrode 128 b. Accordingly, breakdown in the integrated power device 300 of FIG. 5 is not expected to be edge limited. Moreover, in applications where the GD-MOSFET unit cells in the active region are expected to be frequently driven into avalanche breakdown, it is preferable to move the location of avalanche breakdown to the more highly doped and deeper breakdown shielding region 117\u2032 within the device 300\u2032 of FIG. 6. In particular, by increasing the depth of the breakdown shielding region 117\u2032, the breakdown voltage can be decreased to a level that will provide sufficient protection to the unit cells in the active device area and improve the lifetime and reliability of the overall device 300\u2032. In addition, as described more fully hereinbelow with respect to FIG. 7, the breakdown voltage and the specific on-resistance Rsp,on can also be scaled downward by decreasing the epitaxial layer thickness of the drift region 112., 97799=As further illustrated by FIG. 7, an increase in the depth of the base region 116 to the level illustrated by the dotted line 116\u2032 can also be used advantageously to suppress the degree of any impact ionization near the gate insulating region 124 that may arise in response to hot electron injection during avalanche breakdown. In particular, steps to form the gate insulating region so that there is an overlap between the thick portion of the gate insulating region 124 (extending upward from the bottom of the trench) and the base region 116 can be used to enhance the electric field contours at the corner of the gate between the thick and thin portions and thereby shield the gate insulating region from the effects of hot electron induced instabilities during avalanche breakdown. Accordingly, the gate insulating region 124 may have a first thickness (shown as T2) of less than about 750 \u212b as measured between the gate electrode 126 and a first intersection between the first sidewall and the P-N junction formed between the source region 118 and P-base region 116. In addition, the gate insulating region 124 may have a second thickness (shown as T1) of greater than about 1500 \u212b as measured between the gate electrode 126 and a second intersection between the first sidewall and the P-N junction formed between the P-base region 116 and the drift region 112. Moreover, because of the illustrated graded doping profile of the base region 116, which falls off near the base/drift region junction; it is still possible to form an inversion layer channel across the entire base region 116 even though the gate oxide thickness is relatively large (e.g., 3000 \u212b) at the drain side of the base region 116. Designing the unit cell to provide this gate shielding advantage may, however, result in some increase in the specific on-state resistance of the device., 40515=A stripe-shaped trench having a pair of opposing sidewalls 120 a that extend in a third dimension (not shown) and a bottom 120 b is then formed in the substrate. For a unit cell 100 having a width Wc of 1 \u03bcm, the trench is preferably formed to have a width \u201cWt\u201d of 0.5 \u03bcm at the end of processing. An insulated gate electrode, comprising a gate insulating region 124 and an electrically conductive gate 126 (e.g., polysilicon), is then formed in the trench. The portion of the gate insulating region 124 extending adjacent the trench bottom 120 b and the drift layer 112 may have a thickness \u201cT1\u201d of about 2000 \u212b to inhibit the occurrence of high electric fields at the bottom of the trench and to provide a substantially uniform potential gradient along the trench sidewalls 120 a. The portion of the gate insulating region 124 extending opposite the base layer 116 and the source layer 118 may have a thickness \u201cT2\u201d of about 500 \u212b to maintain the threshold voltage of the device at about 2-3 volts. Simulations of the unit cell 100 at a gate bias of 15 Volts confirm that a vertical silicon field effect transistor having a maximum blocking voltage capability of 60 Volts and a specific on-resistance (Rsp,on) of 40 \u03bc\u03a9cm2, which is four (4) times smaller than the ideal specific on-resistance of 170 \u03bc\u03a9cm2 for a 60 volt power UMOSFET, can be achieved. Notwithstanding these excellent characteristics, the transistor of FIG. 2 may suffer from a relatively low high-frequency figure-of-merit (HFOM) if the overall gate-to-drain capacitance (CGD) is too large. Improper edge termination of the MOSFET may also prevent the maximum blocking voltage from being achieved., 74546=The drift layer 112 and transition region 117 may be formed by epitaxially growing an N-type in-situ doped monocrystalline silicon layer having a thickness of about 4 \u03bcm on an N-type drain contact layer 114 (e.g., N+ substrate) having a thickness of 100 \u03bcm and a first conductivity type doping concentration of greater than about 1\ufffd1018 cm\u22123(e.g. 1\ufffd1019 cm\u22123) therein. As illustrated, the drift layer 112 may have a linearly graded doping profile therein with a maximum concentration of greater than about 5\ufffd1016 cm\u22123 (e.g., 3\ufffd1017 cm\u22123) at the N+/N non-rectifying junction with the drain contact layer 114 and a minimum concentration of about 1\ufffd1016 cm\u22123 at the junction with the transition region 117. The base layer 116 may be formed by implanting P-type dopants such as boron into the drift layer 112 at an energy of 100 kEV and at a dose level of 1\ufffd1014 cm\u22122, for example. The P-type dopants may then be diffused to a depth of 0.8 \u03bcm into the drift layer 112. An N-type dopant such as arsenic may then be implanted at an energy of 50 kEV and at dose level of 1\ufffd1015 cm\u22122. The N-type and P-type dopants are then diffused simultaneously to a depth of 0.5 \u03bcm and 1.0 \u03bcm, respectively. The second conductivity type (e.g., P-type) doping concentration in the base layer 116 is also preferably greater than about 5\ufffd1016 cm\u22123 at the P-N junction with the source layer 118 (i.e., first P-N junction). A selective implanting step may also be performed at a relatively high dose and high energy level to define the P+ base region extension 119., 38374=In particular, U.S. Pat. No. 5,637,898 to Baliga discloses a preferred silicon field effect transistor that is commonly referred to as a graded-doped (GD) UMOSFET. As illustrated by FIG. 2, which is a reproduction of FIG. 3 from the '898 patent, a unit cell 100 of an integrated power semiconductor device field effect transistor may have a width \u201cWc\u201d of 1 \u03bcm and comprise a highly doped drain layer 114 of first conductivity type (e.g., N+) substrate, a drift layer 112 of first conductivity type having a linearly graded doping concentration therein, a relatively thin base layer 116 of second conductivity type (e.g., P-type) and a highly doped source layer 118 of first conductivity type (e.g., N+). The drift layer 112 may be formed by epitaxially growing an N-type in-situ doped monocrystalline silicon layer having a thickness of 4 \u03bcm on an N-type drain layer 114 having a thickness of 100 \u03bcm and a doping concentration of greater than 1\ufffd1018 cm\u22123 (e.g. 1\ufffd1019 cm\u22123) therein. The drift layer 112 also has a linearly graded doping concentration therein with a maximum concentration of 3\ufffd1017 cm\u22123 at the N+/N junction with the drain layer 114, and a minimum concentration of 1\ufffd1016 cm\u22123 beginning at a distance 3 \u03bcm from the N+/N junction (i.e., at a depth of 1 \u03bcm) and continuing at a uniform level to the upper face. The base layer 116 may be formed by implanting a P-type dopant such as boron into the drift layer 112 at an energy of 100 keV and at a dose level of 1\ufffd1014 cm\u22122. The P-type dopant may then be diffused to a depth of 0.5 \u03bcm into the drift layer 112. An N-type dopant such as arsenic may also be implanted at an energy of 50 keV and at dose level of 1\ufffd1015 cm\u22122. The N-type and P-type dopants can then be diffused simultaneously to a depth of 0.5 \u03bcm and 1.0 \u03bcm, respectively, to form a composite semiconductor substrate containing the drain, drift, base and source layers., 59296=Referring now to FIG. 3A, an integrated power semiconductor device according to a first embodiment of the present invention will be described. In particular, a unit cell 200 of a preferred integrated power semiconductor device has a predetermined width \u201cWc\u201d (e.g., 1 \u03bcm) and comprises a highly doped drain layer 114 of first conductivity type (e.g., N+), a drift layer 112 of first conductivity type having a linearly graded doping concentration therein, a relatively thin base layer 116 of second conductivity type (e.g., P-type) and a highly doped source layer 118 of first conductivity type (e.g., N+). A source electrode 128 b and drain electrode 130 may also be provided at the first and second faces, in ohmic contact with the source layer 118 and drain layer 114, respectively. The source electrode 128 b also preferably forms an ohmic contact with the base layer 116 in a third dimension (not shown). The drift layer 112 may be formed by epitaxially growing an N-type in-situ doped monocrystalline silicon layer having a thickness of about 4 \u03bcm on an N-type drain layer 114 (e.g., N+ substrate) having a thickness of 100 \u03bcm and a first conductivity type doping concentration of greater than about 1\ufffd1018 cm\u22123 (e.g. 1\ufffd1019 cm\u22123) therein. As illustrated, the drift layer 112 may have a linearly graded doping concentration therein with a maximum concentration of greater than about 5\ufffd1016 cm\u22123 (e.g., 3\ufffd1017 cm\u22123) at the N+/N non-rectifying junction with the drain layer 114 and a minimum concentration of 1\ufffd1016 cm\u22123 at a depth of 1 \u03bcm and continuing at a uniform level to the upper face. The base layer 116 may be formed by implanting P-type dopants such as boron into the drift layer 112 at an energy of 100 keV and at a dose level of 1\ufffd1014 cm\u22122, for example. The P-type dopants may then be diffused to a depth of 0.5 \u03bcm into the drift layer 112. An N-type dopant such as arsenic may then be implanted at an energy of 50 keV and at dose level of 1\ufffd1015 cm\u22122. The N-type and P-type dopants are then diffused simultaneously to a depth of 0.5 \u03bcm and 1.0 \u03bcm, respectively, to form a composite semiconductor substrate containing the drain, drift, base and source layers. As illustrated by FIG. 3A, the first conductivity type (e.g., N-type) doping concentration in the drift layer 112 is preferably less than about 5\ufffd1016 cm\u22123 at the P-N junction with the base layer 116 (i.e., second P-N junction), and more preferably only about 1\ufffd1016 cm\u22123 at the P-N junction with the base layer 116. The second conductivity type (e.g., P-type) doping concentration in the base layer 116 is also preferably greater than about 5\ufffd1016 cm\u22123 at the P-N junction with the source layer 118 (i.e., first P-N junction). Furthermore, according to a preferred aspect of the present invention, the second conductivity type doping concentration in the base layer 116 at the first P-N junction (e.g., 1\ufffd1017 cm\u22123) is about ten times greater than the first conductivity type doping concentration in the drift region at the second P-N junction (e.g., 1\ufffd1016 cm\u22123)., 64006=Here, the trench-based source electrode 128 a is electrically connected to the source electrode 128 b in a third dimension (not shown). In particular, because the source electrode 128 b typically covers a top surface of the active device area, the contacts between the source electrode 128 b and the trench-based source electrode 128 are typically made at the ends of the stripe-shaped trench. The portion of the gate electrode/source electrode insulating region 125 extending adjacent the trench bottom 120 b and the drift layer 112 may also have a thickness \u201cT1\u201d in a range between about 1500 \u212b and 3000 \u212b, for example, to inhibit the occurrence of high electric field crowding at the bottom corners of the trench and to provide a substantially uniform potential gradient along the trench sidewalls 120 a. However, the portion of the gate electrode/source electrode insulating region 125 extending opposite the base layer 116 and the source layer 118 preferably has a thickness \u201cT2\u201d of less than about 750 \u212b, and more preferably about 500 \u212b to maintain the threshold voltage of the device at about 2-3 volts. The use of tapered trench-based insulating regions to improve electric field profiles in highly doped drift region mesas is also described in U.S. application Ser. No. 09/322,424, to B. Jayant Baliga, entitled \u201cPower Semiconductor Devices That Utilize Tapered Trench-Based Insulating Regions to improve Electric Field Profiles in Highly Doped Drift Region Mesas and Methods of Forming Same\u201d, filed May 28, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,191,447, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. In particular, these tapered trench-based insulating regions are most preferably designed to have a nonuniform thickness Tins(y) in a range between about 0.5 and 1.5 times Tideal(Y) where Tideal(y)|y\u2266\u03b1=\u03b5ins((2\u03b5sEcr/qWmNd)(y\u2212\u03b1)+\ufffdWm)/\u03b5s and \u03b5ins is the permittivity of the electrically insulating region, \u03b5s is the permittivity of the drift region, Ecr is the breakdown electric field strength of the drift region, q is the electron charge, Nd is the first conductivity type doping concentration in the drift region, Wm is a width of the mesa, y is the depth, relative to a top of the first trench, at which the thickness of the electrically insulating region is being determined and \u03b1 is a non-negative constant. The constant \u03b1 may equal zero in the event the power device is a Schottky rectifier and may equal the depth of the P-base region/N-drift region junction in the event the power device is a vertical MOSFET, for example., 66899=Numerical simulations of the unit cell 200 of FIG. 3A were performed using a drift region doping concentration that increases from a value of 1\ufffd1016 cm\u22123 at a depth of 1 micron to a value of 2\ufffd1017 cm \u22123 at a trench depth (TD) of 5 microns. The thin portion of the gate/source electrode insulating region 125 extended to 1.2 microns of a total trench depth of 4.7 microns and had a thickness of 500 \u212b. The thick portion of the gate/source electrode insulating region 125 had a thickness of 3000 \u212b. The N+ source layer 118 depth was set to 0.3 microns, and the depth of the P-type base region 116 was set to 0.9 microns. A half-cell width of 1 micron was used based on 1 micron design rules. The polysilicon gate electrode 127 extended to 1.2 microns and the polysilicon source electrode 128 a extended from 1.5 microns to 4.4 microns. Based on these parameters, the specific on-resistance (Ron,sp) at a gate bias of 15 volts was found to be 114 microOhm cm2 and the device blocked more than 60 volts. Comparisons of the potential distributions and contours in the device of FIG. 3A at a drain bias of 60 volts, against the device of FIG. 2, indicated essentially no change in the electric field profile within the drift region. This finding suggests that the trench-based source electrode 128 a does not upset the degree of charge coupling and field distribution required to obtain high performance operation. Moreover, even though the specific on resistance of the device of FIG. 3A was about 20% greater than the specific on-resistance of the device of FIG. 2, the high frequency figure-of-merit (HFOM), defined as (Ron,sp(QGS+QGD))\u22121, where QGS and QGD represent the gate-source and gate-drain charge per unit area, was also calculated to be three (3) times better than the HFOM for the device of FIG. 2. This result means the device of FIG. 3A is very suitable for high frequency operation., 30121=This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser.

Nos. 09/995,109, 09/602,414, 09/377,006 and 09/178,845 are hereby incorporated herein by reference., 111701=Two-dimensional numerical simulations were performed on the vertical MOSFET of FIG. 9H. For each unit cell, the deep trench 513 had a depth and width of 5 microns and 1.8 microns, respectively, and the electrically insulating layer 514 lining the sidewalls 513 a and bottom 513 b of the deep trench 513 had a thickness of 350 nm (3500 \u212b). The drift region 504 had a thickness of six (6) microns. The shallow trenches 515 within each buried insulated source electrode 516 had a depth of 0.5 microns and the gate oxide 518 a had a thickness of 40 nm (400 \u212b). The linear graded doping profile in the drift region 504 had a slope of 1.5\ufffd1020 cm\u22124 and the drift region mesa 504 a had a width of 1 micron. Accordingly, the cell pitch associated with each unit cell was 2.8 microns. The source electrode 516 and gate electrode 520 comprised polysilicon and polycide, respectively. Based on these characteristics, the breakdown voltage was simulated as 85 Volts and a low specific on-state resistance (Rsp) of 0.25 milli-Ohm cm2 was achieved. The specific gate charge Qt (to Vg=10 Volts) was found to be 4.93\ufffd10\u22127 C/cm2 and the specific Miller gate charge was found to be 8.6\ufffd10\u22128 C/cm2. The Figure of Merit (FOM) corresponding to these results was 8.3\ufffd109 (i.e., Rsp\ufffdQt \u22121=8.3\ufffd109). In contrast, the vertical MOSFET of FIG. 1 was simulated using the same parameters (but without buried insulated source electrode) and yielded a breakdown voltage of 85 Volts and a much higher specific on-state resistance (Rsp) of 1.2 milli-Ohm cm2. The specific gate charge Qt (to Vg=10 Volts) was found to be 3.0\ufffd10\u22127 C/cm2 and the specific Miller gate charge was found to be 1.0\ufffd10\u22128 C/cm2. The Figure of Merit (FOM) corresponding to these results was 2.8\ufffd109, which is about one third the FOM for the device of FIG. 9H., 94601=Referring now to FIG. 7, an integrated power semiconductor device 400 according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention will be described. As illustrated, this power device 400 is a hybrid device that may contain the GD-UMOSFET unit cells of FIGS. 2 and 3A-3B (having non-uniformly thick gate insulating regions therein) extending adjacent one sidewall of each trench in the active region and a modified TMBS Schottky rectifier (acting as a flyback diode) extending adjacent an opposing sidewall of each trench. In the modified TMBS Schottky rectifier illustrated on the left side of the unit cell of FIG. 7, preferred charge coupling is provided by a gate electrode within a trench having a non-uniformly thick gate insulating region therein, instead of an anode electrode and a uniformly thick insulating region. Moreover, whereas conventional TMBS rectifiers, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,612,567 to Baliga, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference, include a linearly graded drift region doping concentration that extends all the way to the Schottky rectifying junction at the face, a uniformly doped region extends adjacent the Schottky rectifying junction in the modified TMBS rectifier of FIG. 7. As illustrated, this uniformly doped portion of the drift region has a doping concentration of 1\ufffd1016 cm\u22123 therein. The advantages of including a uniformly doped region adjacent the Schottky rectifying junction in a TMBS device are more fully described in the aforementioned application entitled \u201cRugged Schottky Barrier Rectifiers Having Improved Avalanche Breakdown Characteristics\u201d., 48388=According to another preferred aspect of this invention, the electrically insulating region includes a gate insulating region having a first thickness (e.g., T2\u2266750 \u212b) as measured between the gate electrode and the sidewall of the first trench, and a source insulating region having a second thickness (e.g., T1\u22671500 \u212b) as measured between the first source electrode and the same sidewall. In addition, a second source electrode is provided on the first face, in ohmic contact with the source region. The first and second source electrodes are electrically connected together., 77306=Here, the trench-based source electrode 128 a is electrically connected to the source electrode 128 b in a third dimension (not shown). The portion of the gate electrode/source electrode insulating region 125 extending adjacent the trench bottom 120 b and the drift layer 112 may also have a thickness \u201cT1\u201d in a range between about 1500 \u212b and 5000 \u212b, for example, to inhibit the occurrence of high electric field crowding at the bottom corners of the trench and to provide a substantially uniform potential gradient along the trench sidewalls 120 a. However, the portion of the gate electrode/source electrode insulating region 125 extending opposite the base layer 116 and the source layer 118 preferably has a thickness \u201cT2\u201d of less than about 750 \u212b, and more preferably about 250 \u212b to maintain the threshold voltage of the device at about 2-3 volts., 42408=Additional prior art MOSFETs are also disclosed in JP 63-296282 (Sony Corp), published Dec. 12, 1988. In particular, JP 63-296282 discloses a MOSFET with first and second gate electrodes built up in a trench and with a gate insulating film therebetween. U.S. Pat. No. 5,578,508 to Baba et al. discloses a vertical power MOSFET that utilizes a buried polysilicon layer within a trench as an ion implantation mask layer that prevents ions from being implanted into the trench bottom at the time of the channel ion implantation. U.S. Pat. No. 5,283,201 to Tsang et al. also discloses a vertical MOSFET having a recessed gate electrode. U.S. Pat. No. 4,941,026 to Temple discloses a vertical channel semiconductor device that includes an insulated gate electrode disposed adjacent a substantial portion of a voltage supporting region. In response to an appropriate bias, the control electrode couples to an electric field originating on charges within the voltage supporting region to reorient the electric field associated with those charges toward the gate electrode and transverse to the direction of current flow through the device., 34765=In view of these desirable characteristics, many variations of power MOSFETs have been designed. Two popular types are the double-diffused MOSFET device (DMOSFET) and the UMOSFET device. These and other power MOSFETs are described in a textbook by B. J. Baliga entitled Power Semiconductor Devices, PWS Publishing Co. (ISBN 0-534-94098-6) (1995), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Chapter 7 of this textbook describes power MOSFETs at pages 335-425. Examples of silicon power MOSFETs including accumulation, inversion and extended trench FETs having trench gate electrodes extending into an N+ drain region are also disclosed in an article by T. Syau, P. Venkatraman and B. J. Baliga, entitled Comparison of Ultralow Specific On-Resistance UMOSFET Structures: The ACCUFET, EXTFET, INVFET, and Conventional UMOSFETs, IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, Vol. 41, No. 5, May (1994). As described by Syau et al., specific on-resistances in the range of 100-250 \u03bc\u03a9cm2 were experimentally demonstrated for devices capable of supporting a maximum of 25 volts. However, the performance of these devices was limited by the fact that the forward blocking voltage must be supported across the gate oxide at the bottom of the trench., 82236=As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the implant and diffusion steps will cause the doping profile of the second conductivity type dopants in the substrate 10 to be generally gaussian in shape and have a maximum value at the first face 15 a. The doping concentration in the base region 16 will also have a maximum value adjacent the source region 18 and a minimum value adjacent the drift region 12. In particular, the implant and diffusion steps may be performed so that the first conductivity type dopant concentration of the source region 18 at the first face 15 a is greater than 1\ufffd1018 cm\u22123 and the second conductivity type dopant concentration in the base region 16 is greater than about 1\ufffd1017 cm\u22123 at a first P-N junction (J1) with the source region 18, but less than about 5\ufffd1016 cm\u22123 and more preferably only about 1\ufffd1016 cm\u22123 at the second P-N junction (J2) with the drift region 12. To meet these criteria, the first conductivity type doping concentration in the drift region 12 should be about 1\ufffd1016 cm\u22123 at the second P-N junction (J2). Because of this relatively low value of 1\ufffd1016 cm\u22123 in the drift region 12, the base region 16 can be made thin (e.g., 0.5 \u03bcm) without being susceptible to parasitic reach-through breakdown and can be doped relatively low to maintain the transistor's threshold voltage at about 2-3 volts., 85831=Referring now to FIG. 4D, which illustrates a cross-section of three adjacent mesas 17, the method continues with the formation of a first electrically insulating region 24 (e.g., SiO2) having a first thickness greater than 1000 \u212b and more preferably about 3000 \u212b, on the trench sidewalls 20 a and the trench bottom 20 b of each trench 20. This step is preferably performed by oxidizing the etched source, base and drift regions, using the oxidation barrier layer 22 b as an oxidation mask. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the growth of an oxide having a thickness of about 3000 \u212b will typically consume about 0.1 \u03bcm or more of semiconductor material. Accordingly, the initial widths of the mesas 17 should be selected so that at the end of processing the widths are at the desired value of about 0.5 \u03bcm., 69033=Still further improvements in performance may be achieved by using a relatively highly doped transition region of first conductivity type that extends between the base layer 116 and the drift layer 112. The use of transition regions to improve device performance is more fully illustrated and described in U.S. application Ser. No. 09/602,414 to Baliga, entitled \u201cMOSFET Devices Having Linear Transfer Characteristics When Operating in Velocity Saturation Mode,\u201d filed Jun. 23, 2000, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Highly doped shielding regions of second conductivity type may also be used to shield the base layer 116 by suppressing P-base reach-through effects when the unit cell 200 is blocking reverse voltages. The use of shielding regions to improve device performance is more fully illustrated and described in U.S. application Ser. No. 09/833,132 to Baliga, entitled \u201cPower Semiconductor Devices Having Retrograded-Doped Transition Regions that Enhance Breakdown Voltage Characteristics and Methods of Forming Same,\u201d filed Apr. 11, 2001, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. FIG. 3B herein is a reproduction of FIG. 3 from the aforementioned '414 application. The use of highly doped shielding regions and additional structures and packaging techniques that improve high frequency switching performance are also illustrated and described in U.S. application Ser. No. 09/993,412, to Baliga, entitled \u201cRadio Frequency (RF) Power Devices Having Faraday Shield Layers Therein,\u201d filed Nov. 5, 2001, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference., 86755=Referring now to FIGS. 4E-4K, a conformal N-type first polycrystalline silicon region 26 is then deposited and etched until it is recessed in the trench to a depth just below the second P-N junction (J2). This first polysilicon region 26 defines a trench-based source electrode. An oxide etching step is then performed to remove the first electrically insulating region 24 from the portions of the sidewalls 20 a that extend adjacent the etched source and base regions 18 and 16, as illustrated best by FIG. 4F. Referring now to FIG. 4G, a second electrically insulating region 28 (e.g., SiO2) having a second thickness less than about 1000 \u212b and more preferably about 500 \u212b, is then formed on the exposed trench sidewalls 20 a and on the polysilicon region 26. Referring now to FIG. 4H, a conformal second polycrystalline silicon region 30 is then deposited on the second electrically insulating region 28. The second polycrystalline silicon region 30 is then etched until it is recessed in the trench to a depth just below the first face 15 a. Steps are also preferably performed to expose the first polysilicon region 26 in a third dimension (not shown) so that subsequent contact can be made to a source electrode on the face 15 a., 78291=Simulations of the device of FIG. 3B were also performed for a unit cell having a half-cell pitch of 1 \u03bcm with a half-mesa width of 0.5 \u03bcm. The thickness T2 was set to 250 \u212b and the thickness of the base layer 116 was set to 0.2 \u03bcm with a peak doping concentration of 2\ufffd1017 cm\u22123. The gate electrode 127 extended to a depth of 0.6 \u03bcm and the trench depth was set to 4.7 \u03bcm. The thickness T1 was also set to 3000 \u212b. The doping concentrations in the transition region 117 and drift layer 112 follow the profile illustrated by FIG. 3B. Based on these characteristics, excellent current saturation characteristics were observed with uniform spacing between the Id v. Vd curves (at gate biases ranging from 2 to 4 volts). Highly linear Id v. Vg transfer characteristics for gate biases in the range from 2 to 4 volts were also observed., 83868=Referring now to FIG. 4C, an etching mask 22 including a stress relief oxide layer 22 a and an oxidation barrier layer 22 b (e.g., Si3N4) is then patterned on the first face 15 a to define openings that expose adjacent portions of the first face extending over the source and base regions 18 and 16. The source, base and drift regions are then chemically etched to form a plurality of trenches 20. As illustrated, each of the trenches has opposing vertical sidewalls 20 a that define interfaces between the source, base and drift regions and an interior of the trench, and a trench bottom 20 b in the drift region. Facing sidewalls 20 a of adjacent trenches also define respective mesas 17 that may have uniform widths of about 0.5 \u03bcm at the end of processing. The trenches 20 and mesas 17, which extend in a third dimension, not shown, can be of stripe or similar geometry. The mesas 17 can also be polygonal (e.g., hexagonal) in shaped with the trenches 20 defining a continuous mesh when viewed from a direction normal to the face 15 a. As explained more fully hereinbelow, the widths of the mesas 17 can be selected to improve the blocking voltage capability of the transistor. In particular, the width of the mesas 17 (at the end of processing) and the doping concentration in the drift region 12 at J3 should be selected so that their product is within the range of 1\ufffd1013-2\ufffd1013 cm\u22122 to obtain a preferred charge concentration in the drift region 12. In addition, the width of the mesas 17 and the doping concentration in the drift region 12 at J2 should be selected so that their product is within the range of 1\ufffd1011-2\ufffd1012 cm\u22122., 90817=To improve the edge termination and breakdown characteristics of the integrated power device 300 even further, the edge termination trench is preferably positioned so that a transition mesa region is defined between opposing sidewalls of the edge termination trench and the trench corresponding to the outermost unit cell of the device 300. However, unlike the mesa regions that are defined between trenches within the active device region of the integrated power device 300, the transition mesa region is preferably formed to be devoid of a source region of first conductivity type. Instead, a preferred breakdown shielding region 117 of second conductivity type (e.g., P-type) is provided. The breakdown shielding region 117 may be formed at the same time the base region 116 is formed, for example. However, as illustrated best by FIG. 6, which is a cross-sectional view of an integrated power semiconductor device 300\u2032 according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention, the breakdown shielding region 117\u2032 may also be formed deeper (and more highly doped) than the base region 116 to further increase the likelihood that avalanche breakdown will occur in the transition mesa region instead of within the active region. The use of breakdown shielding regions to improve the breakdown characteristics of power semiconductor devices is also described in commonly assigned U.S. application Ser. No. 09/167,298, filed Oct. 6, 1998, entitled \u201cRugged Schottky Barrier Rectifiers Having Improved Avalanche Breakdown Characteristics\u201d, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. It is preferred that the depth of the breakdown shielding regions be less than about 0.5 times the depth of the trenches.}",
