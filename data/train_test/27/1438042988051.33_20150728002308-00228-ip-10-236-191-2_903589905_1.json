            "A majority of Hiram students are first generation college students and that is something the college prides itself on. This is because when students graduates, which they will because the school has a ninety-five percent graduation rate, the whole family is moved by the experience. Also, this is a liberal arts college so it is along the lines of the movie, Accepted because Hiram is run by the students. Rather than the city making the college, the college makes the city in Hiram, OH. Also, this is a great time for any type of students because so many programs are offered and the college is expanding. In the last two-three years a new dorm has been created, an entrepreneurship, ethics, public leadership, and nursing program started, a new dinning hall, townhouses, an institution for public leadership, and additional parking so that all students can have cars. Before that a brand new athletic facility and art institute. All of these with out touching upon the buildings which have been remodeled and furnished. In 2009 when most schools were worried about cutting professors and cutting funds Hiram College listed all time high donations in the millions.",
            "Things to use around campus are the Writing Center, Career Center, professors, and library on a regular basis. Professors seems like an odd thing to list but at Hiram College the teachers are approachable and always willing to help. They will give out multiple forms in which to contact them including their home phone and in most cases none of them are needed because students can just stop by their office. At most universities there are waiting lists to see a professor and times have to be scheduled but their is always an open door policy here. Furthermore, something people should not miss out on is the involvement fair which takes place each fall. This is a lay out of booths which showcases each active club on campus and is a great way to meet new people. Lastly, each spring there are leadership applications in which students can become resident assistants, teaching assistants, orientation leaders, community council members, and international tour guides. These positions are a great way to be role models, make money, and stuff resumes.",
            "If you ask students around campus, Why did you come to Hiram College, a majority of them will save they were the cheapest? Even though the sticker price for a single year at Hiram College is $34,000 with room and board it is only there to scare people. A majority of the students pay under $11,000 with room and board and that is less then most state colleges. Rather than going to a college which crams three hundred students into an auditorium to meet with a professor who will never even know your name Hiram prides itself on classes smaller then twenty-four students from day one. The college has been ranked in the Princeton review for having the best college experience and most for your money. This is a liberal arts college and because of that a lot more experiences are offered such as three week study abroad trips. Due to the availability and affordable price to study abroad over fifty percent of students do so by the time they graduate. Also, there are many opportunities to learn about other cultures with twelve to fifteen percent of students being international, a large international forum club which is open to everyone, a program put on yearly to display the different cultures, and Bowler dormitory putting on a tribute to a different country on the first Friday of each month. In addition, there are forty-five active clubs on campus which can be joined along with fourteen varsity sports most of which allow walk on try outs.",
            "I have fallen in love with Hiram College as most people due once they begin walking around the beautiful campus and interact with the students, faculty, and staff. The school is in country side of northeast Ohio where all four seasons can be seen in a single day. The autumn leafs are painted orange and red and give the blacks squirrels native to the region a fun place to play. With traditional ceremonies as the freshman walk, country ho-down, homecoming week, Run for Grace and Andy, Institute week, Campus Day, Springfest, and many other activities the fun never stops. Springfest is one of the most famous traditions at Hiram because it is the division between twelve week classes and a three week class where students can really unwind. Events consist of a comedian, live bands such as Asher Roth, Tray Songs, and Trapt, hot tubs, inflatables, and more. The students on campus are great and since it is a small institution every one knows each other and it is common to say hello to everyone walking around campus.",
            "I am currently going into my fourth semester at Hiram College and have been learning every step up the way. The fall of your freshman year you take a first year class where students learn about a particular topic and while doing so learn how to write, speak, and give presentation at a college level. I found myself in need of this class and have it to thank for allowing me to make the Dean's list, which is 3.6 or high GPA on a 4.0 scale. In addition to this class I found the Writing Center happy to work with my skills each and every time I needed help. There was even a time during finals when the center was closed but still had the ability to e-mail one of the students I met there for help. In addition, the bond I formed with my adviser was amazing because he was there every step of the way to show me how to design my class schedule to prepare for law school."

Whether you learn better listening, visually or through doing, there are many classes in which you can learn through. Hiram, wants to help develop a student. So if you are not the best student but you did well on your ACT and did community service, they work with you to help give you the best education you can have. Tips for prospective students If you are more of a country/rural kind of person this is great. It is a small community of people in Hiram and Hiram, while expanding, has an average of 1,100 students. If you are afraid of gaining the freshman 15, no worries, Hiram is on a hill and you have to walk up and down a hill. It really is not that bad, but it is great form of exercise.",
