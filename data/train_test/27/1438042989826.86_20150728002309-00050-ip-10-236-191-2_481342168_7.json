The efficiency of the triphenylmethane media was better than twice that of Virgin PP over the difficult to filter 0.1 to 0.4 micron range. Below 0.1 micron, efficiencies of media are expected to be similar, due to the fact that these small particles are in large part captured by Brownian motion. One ounce per square yard (1 osy) melt blown electret webs were made from polypropylene (PP) and PP +5% of the triphenylmethane compound described in example 4. Fibers were corona charged as they exited the 6\" die. Samples of these media were tested for filtration efficiency. EXAMPLE 7 The sample was charged negatively at 135\ufffd C.
