            "We have an excellent Campus Safety Department on campus which is dedicated to keeping its students safe. They do an excellent job. I have never felt in danger of anything but having too much fun!",
            "While there are academic societies, there are no sororities on campus. Although, I have never heard anyone complain about the fact here. Dorms freshman year and off campus housing the other 3 years remain very popular.",
            "Intramural sports and such activities are very popular on campus. In addition, many clubs and groups meet weekly to join in some shared passion.",
            "Positive, fun, ambitious, cynical. There is a niche for anyone at APU.",
            "The rose garden is the place to go if you are hoping to make things official with someone of the opposite gender. Many relationships have been born within that beautiful garden.",
            "The all around APU experience is well worth the cost of attendance. You will leave having a better idea of what you want to do with your life, as well as a great education and many dear friends.",
            "There are many hiking trails nearby as well as a fairly close proximity to Los Angeles and the beach. The campus is very pretty and lively, offering diversion at any time.",
            "There are some delicious on campus dining venues. While there are less options during the weekend, it is worth it for what is available during the week.",
            "There are great people in the dorms. There is always someone up doing something around the dorms, but still enough space to get some quiet rest.",
            "Challenging classes with great teacher. Prepare to think.",
            "If you are looking for a friendly school with smaller classes, apply to APU. There are no teacher's aides teaching classes here. You get to know your professors and classes well.",
            "The school has an extremely friendly and open environment. Classes are intimate and challenging, with professors that genuinely care about their students. This school has recently joined the NCAA, and has other exciting plans in its future!"

Be open to change and keep the future in mind! If you haven't visited yet, take a tour of the campus! Visit the department in which you are planning on majoring in. Make sure you are ready to be fully immersed in a Christian environment. Start looking out for sales on things you might need for college and start buying over summer so it's not stressful once you get to school! Read the ENTIRE code of conduct, housing rules, and just be prepared for what is expected of you once you get to APU. Make sure to register for classes as early as possible and ask your academic advisor as many questions as you need in order to be prepared for the year! Stay in contact with your admissions counselor often over the summer if you have questions. Also, get talking to future classmates on Facebook so you can make friends! The APU Class of 2015 page is where I made many friends before even getting to school, you can do the same! Have goals for the school year- not just long term goals, but lots of short term ones that you can achieve throughout the year. Have a mentor. Whether it is your alpha leader, RA, a professor you meet, ask an older person to be your mentor throughout college and guide you through life. Use ratemyprofessors.com to the fullest. You won't regret it. You will regret not using it! Compare book prices on amazon and the bookstore. Don't pay more than you need to., 7760=Honestly everyone could fit in at this school. We don't necessarily have a specific cookie cutter mold that you have to fit. There are many out of state students that attend here which adds to the diversity. The only requirement that I believe that would be necessary is that you have an open and receptive heart to the Christian lifestyle. There are many on-fire Christians at this school that might catch you off guard if you have never been exposed but they definitely should not intimidate you. You are not required to be a Christian but that doesn't mean that you can go about living any which way you please. The university wants to maintain its reputation of its motto to have God First. It goes all the way up to our president who constantly shows us a God driven heart to care for each and everyone person. If you can just buy into the mission you will enjoy your experience to the utmost. It says in the most cliche verse of the whole Bible, John 3:16, that ...God so loved the WORLD..., the entire world and that is what we are called to do as Christians as difficult and challenging as that may be but with the strength and love that God empowers us with each and every person will feel a sense of belonging. Some people who may not enjoy this experience are ones that dislike: Warm weather Suburban areas Required Chapel attendances (3 a week) Required Community service (120 credits by graduation) Required Bible Courses Having a good time! haha Like I said, this school only requires an open and willing heart ready to listen and act on the way God is pushing or pulling you. Sit back, relax and enjoy our Creators wild ride!!!, 745070=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 635243=Skip out on the caf (1899 dining hall) it ruins your stomach, but the west campus eating areas are way better. Their is two sandwich shops, a sushi place, pizza place, fast food type place, BBQ stand, Mexican restaurant, coffee shop, and west campus cafeteria on campus., 377852=Azusa Pacific University has a satellite school, which is conveniently located in my city of Victorville. The facility is beautiful and very functional. The instructors are all very knowledgeable. I am proud to become a graduate of APU in November of 2012!}",
