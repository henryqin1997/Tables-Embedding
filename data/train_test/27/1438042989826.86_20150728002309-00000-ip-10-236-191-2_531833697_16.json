The taxpayer must indicate they wish an equivalent hearing if their request for a Collection Due Process hearing is not timely.

Employees receive a real time error message when attempting to issue levies on sources that do not comply with postal mailing standards. Employees need to research and correct the levy source address information before the levy can be issued. The corrected address will be validated during real-time processing. If the Code-1 Plus (C1P) value is \"1\" after validation, proceed with levy action. If the C1P value is other than \"1\" , a status message will generate indicating the invalid address condition and a levy cannot be issued. See IRM 5.19.4-4 for additional information on C1P, C1G, and C1Z values., 309057=If the taxpayer has a new address , and a NFTL is required, only enter the new address on IDRS using CC ENREQ in accordance with Rev.

(See Policy Statement P-5-29 of IRM 1.2.14.1.6, Policy Statements for Collecting Process Activities, and IRM 5.19.4.4.3(4).) This type of response also may mean that the employer is confused about computing the exempt amount, so a call helps resolve current and future levy issues. If the levy source will be retained for future use, document the levy information in ACS Comments or AMS History. If it is unlikely the levy source will ever be productive, delete it and proceed with case processing., 37286=Disqualified Employment Tax Levy (DETL) - A legislative change implemented on 3/11/2008 permits issuance of a levy without prior CDP rights for certain levies to collect employment taxes called \"disqualified employment tax levies.\" A warning message will be displayed on ACS: \"Qualify for DETL?\" when there is a delinquent employment tax module, 941 (mft 01), 943 (mft 11), 944 (mft 14), 945 (mft 16), 940 (mft 10), or CT-1 (mft 09); and there is an indication that a prior CDP levy hearing was held within 2 years from the beginning of the period to be levied.

If less than anticipated, contact the employer to determine whether the taxpayer is claiming too many exemptions or is allowing voluntary deductions to an extent that defeats the levy. (See IRM 5.19.4.4.3(4) and Policy Statement P-5-29 of IRM 1.2.14.1.6 Policy Statements for Collecting Process Activities.), 317784=If a representative is not authorized to receive information on all of the tax modules included on the NFTL, the specific tax modules for which that person is authorized must be shown in ACS Comments or AMS History comments or on the Form 12636., 177335=Publication 1494, which is mailed with the Form 668-W, explains to the employer how to compute the amount exempt from levy.

On October 10, 2006, the taxpayer entered into an installment agreement and the account is now in Status 60 (Installment Agreement Status). You receive a call from the taxpayer on November 10, 2006 that his employer is still taking the money out of his check in the levy amount. You review CC IADIS and notice that there is an actual Installment Agreement (IA) and not a continuous wage levy. You review the comments and History codes on ACS and AMS systems and note that there is no indication that the levy was released. There is also no documentation that the levy is a condition of the IA. The employer will not accept verbal authorization that the levy has been released and if sent through the mail they will not receive the release in time. Fax the release to the employer., 133953=In a community property state, taxpayers who are liable for delinquent tax may have a community property interest in their spouse's wages, so the wages of the spouse not liable for the tax might be subject to levy. (See IRM 5.11.6.12 for more information.), 228010=The taxpayer is a federal employee see IRM 5.19.18.5.6(1)., 146221=A Form 668-A is also used to serve a levy on the acquiring bank or processor holding a merchant account, (1099K). The funds held by the processors and acquiring bank are not deposits within the meaning of IRC 6332(c) and the 21 day holding period does not apply to these funds. Therefore, the credit card processor makes the payment when they otherwise make payments according to the merchant contract. For additional information on Merchant Account levies, see IRM 5.11.6.15. For additional information on income reported on Form 1099K see IRM 5.19.4.3.5.1, 38415=A legislative change implemented on 3/11/2008 permits issuance of a levy without prior CDP rights for certain levies to collect employment taxes called \"disqualified employment tax levies.\" The DETL is used to collect a taxpayer\u2019s employment tax liability if that taxpayer requested a CDP hearing under section 6330 for unpaid employment taxes arising in the two-year period prior to the beginning of the taxable period for which the levy is served.

Manually prepared levies by ACS employees are rare. A manually prepared levy is not generated by the action history \"LV\" on ACS, rather they are typed by an employee and require a hand written signature. See IRM 5.19.4.3.11, 151883=A Form 12175 must be prepared when issuing a manual levy, see IRM 5.19.5.9, Notification of Third Party Contact, for documentation requirements., 302460=Accounts that have modules with an unreversed TC470 require manual NFTL filing.

Over-collection attributed to multiple simultaneous levies is not grounds to accelerate refunds. A manual refund will be initiated only for hardship cases. See IRM 5.1.12.20., 278073=Amendments to the Treasury Regulations changed the rules with respect to the assessment and collection of employment taxes and certain excise taxes. A single-member LLC that is disregarded for federal tax purposes is regarded and treated as a separate entity for purposes of certain excise taxes and employment taxes.
