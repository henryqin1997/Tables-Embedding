    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{27374=\u201cImani\u201d is Swahili for \u201cfaith,\u201d and it\u2019s the perfect name for Imani Biggers. It\u2019s been said that faith doesn\u2019t have or know an age, and that\u2019s certainly true with Imani. When asked what she thinks makes her special, the soft-spoken, bright-eyed 9-year-old sits quietly for a few moments, pondering her answer. Her eyes well up with tears as she softly replies. \u201cI have God in my heart,\u201d she said. \u201cHe watches over me.\u201d Her sincere response is proof of just how special this little girl is. Born on Aug. 27, 2003, Imani was six weeks premature, and was only three pounds and nine ounces when her mother, Vanessa, brought her home. \u201cI could hold her in one hand,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cI was the proudest mom in the world. I wanted to bring my baby home. I didn\u2019t care how little she was.\u201d While she was small, Imani was healthy and had few, if any, complications. However, when Imani was 3 years old Vanessa signed her up for preschool at Glasscock Elementary School, and during the preschool screening process it was discovered that Imani had severe hearing loss in her right ear. Imani was born with sensorineural hearing loss, which is often genetic. Hearing loss runs in Vanessa\u2019s family. At that young age, Imani had to wear hearing aids. Initially, it was difficult because Vanessa worried about her daughter being made fun of at school. \u201cI would try to comb her hair to try and hide them,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t bother her. It was hard for me. I had to let it go. She wasn\u2019t upset about it, so I didn\u2019t need to be either.\u201d Imani hasn\u2019t let her disability hold her back from doing anything. In fact, because of her hearing aids, her hearing is stronger than her classmates and friends. Sometimes, her hearing is too good. She actually had to ask the employees at a movie theatre to turn down the sound when she was watching the Justin Bieber \u201cNever Say Never\u201d movie. All the girls screaming at Bieber in the film were entirely too loud for her. Recently, Imani was asked to be a Kosair Kid. The invitation came after Kosair Charities helped Vanessa purchase a new hearing aid for her after she lost one. At the time, Vanessa was temporarily out of work, and didn\u2019t know how she would replace the expensive device. J.F. \u201cJerry\u201d Evans, a deacon at their church, First Baptist Church in Lebanon, encouraged Vanessa to contact Kosair Charities and within weeks Imani had a new hearing aid. Since then, Imani has been interviewed for a television program (which hasn\u2019t aired yet), and is featured on the Kosair Charities website. All of the extra attention isn\u2019t going to Imani\u2019s head. She\u2019s as humble as ever. But she\u2019s definitely an above average kid. She was on the A/B honor roll at Glasscock Elementary, and she particularly loves science and math. Her favorite thing about school is recess, especially when she and her classmates get to play dodgeball. \u201cShe\u2019ll try anything,\u201d Vanessa said. In 2011, Imani was one of the first members of Marion County\u2019s Girls on the Run chapter. Girls on the Run is a national program for girls 8 to 13 years old. The program combines training for a 3.1-mile running event with self-esteem enhancing, uplifting workouts. Vanessa said the Girls on the Run program has helped build Imani\u2019s confidence. Imani said it\u2019s helped her make more friends. \u201cI get to run \u2026 And, I get to learn about not bullying people, and all that stuff,\u201d she said. Aside from running, Imani loves to jump on trampolines, and she loves to sleep late. Something her mom is grateful for, especially on the weekends. When Imani grows up, she said she wants to be a nurse, like her grandmother. \u201cI want to help the elderly,\u201d she said. Imani\u2019s teacher, Jessica Veatch, said Imani\u2019s work ethic and attitude will help her go far in life. \u201cImani is a delight to have in my classroom,\u201d Veatch said. \u201cI love seeing her smile each day, and she is a very hard worker that puts a ton of effort into anything that I ask her to do.\u201d Principal Lee Ann Divine said Imani is like a ray of sunshine at Glasscock Elementary. \u201cShe is one of those students that can give you a smile and brighten your entire day,\u201d she said. \u201cShe does not let anything get her down and her positive attitude is contagious.\u201d But, Divine is not only Imani\u2019s school principal, she\u2019s also been Imani\u2019s running buddy with the Girls on the Run program. Divine said Imani has endless energy and is an excellent motivator. \u201cImani can run circles around me,\u201d Divine said. \u201cShe has more energy than anyone I know.\u201d During the Marion County Country Ham Days Pokey Pig 5K, Imani motivated Divine to keep going. \u201cShe just kept saying, \u2018Come on Mrs. Divine. You can do it,\u2019 because there was no way I could keep up,\u201d Divine said. \u201cI was able to finish with her, but only because she kept slowing down for me. She is an awesome motivator.\u00a0I know whatever this young lady chooses to do with her life, she will be successful. I am so lucky to have her as my \u2018buddy.\u2019\u201d, 46121=Copyright \u00a9 2015}",
