Reliance on the bow and arrow for hunting, along with the use of bedrock mortars and milling slicks, steatite ornaments and containers, perforated stones, circular shell fishhooks, numerous and varied bone tools, as well as bone and shell ornamentation mark the beginning of this period, lasting to the time of Spanish contact ca. A.D. 1769 (cf. Warren, 1984; Wallace, 1955). Elaborate mortuary customs along with generous use of asphaltum and the development of extensive trade networks are also characteristic of this period. During the latter half of the late prehistoric period in the coastal region, pottery, ceramic pipes, cremation urns, rock paintings, and some European trade goods were added to the previous cultural assemblage (Meighan, 1954). By A.D. 1500, strong ethnic patterns developed among native populations in southern California. This may reflect accelerated cultural change brought about by increased efficiency in subsistence resource procurement, processing, storage and distribution; diffusion of technology from the central coastal region of California and the southern Great Basin; and the need for territorial circumscription and defense in the face of population growth (Douglas et al., 1981:10)., 69682=CA-LAN-1783 P-19-001783, 156836=2004.

County of Los Angeles General Plan. County of Los Angeles Department of Regional Planning. Los Angeles, California., 12225=Early contact with Europeans forced changes on Native Americans. These changes included the Spanish mission system, military campaigns, and introduced diseases which spread rapidly and decimated the Native American population. Native groups were greatly reduced and incorporated in the Spanish-American economy by the 1830s. They were grouped by Spanish and others into three categories: residents of Hispanic ranchos; day laborers who lived around missions and towns; and those who remained in the interior rancherias, adhering to a more traditional way of life. The decimation of the Native American population increased during the smallpox epidemics of 1863 and 1870, reducing most Native American populations to less than 80 percent of their pre-contact size., 72426=Prehistoric lithic scatter and historic era debris scatter (ca. 1920-1940), 16117=A systematic intensive archaeological pedestrian survey of TRTP Segments 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 was conducted between November 11, 2006 and April 4, 2007. A typical survey corridor is 250 feet wide, bisected by the transmission line; 500 feet wide for portions of Segments 6 and 11 within the boundaries of Angeles National Forest. The goal and purpose of this intensive inventory was to identify and record newly discovered archaeological resources and to revisit, update and define accurate site boundaries for previously recorded resources using GPS., 101063=CA-LAN-1382, 159041=King, C. and T. C. Blackburn. 1978. Tatavium. In Handbook of North American Indians, edited by R. F. Heizer, pp. 535-537. Vol. 8. Smithsonian Institution, Washington., 4423=The Middle Holocene Period (ca. 5,000 B.C. to A.D. 500) is characterized by a fluorescence of Archaic cultures. Distinctive pressure-flaked projectile points appear in association with core tools, mortars and pestles, and a specialized millingstone industry, as well as substantially constructed rock-lined ovens. In the western Mojave Desert and Antelope Valley changes in human adaptation are probably as a result of the desiccation of Pleistocene lakes caused by the onset of a period of extreme aridity. Sites are commonly found near streams and springs, in rock shelters, and in the vicinity lithic quarry areas. Well-developed middens are relatively rare (Myhrer and Haaklau, 2006:4-4) suggesting relatively mobile human populations and increased reliance upon plant resources., 156039=City of Monterey Park. 2006. Monterey Park Municipal Code. Lexis Nexis Municipal Codes. Bellevue, Washington., 3723=Native Americans have inhabited southern California for at least 12,000 years. Evidence of late Pleistocene occupation has been documented for Antelope Valley by Glennan (1971, 1987) and Basgall and Overly (2004). Evidence of early human occupation in the Los Angeles area was recovered from the tar pits of Rancho La Brea. In 1914 the partial skeleton of a young woman was discovered (Merriam, 1914) and a date of 9,000 \u00b1 80 Before Present (BP). (UCLA-1229 BB) was obtained from a bone collagen sample (Berger et al., 1971). The presence of early projectile point types along the coast suggests region-wide connections among early cultures of southeastern California., 160406=2007b.

Misi\u00f3n de San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel (Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel or Mission San Gabriel) was established by Father Jun\u00edpero Serra in 1771, and El Pueblo de Nuestra la Reina de Los Angeles (The City of our Lady Queen of the Angels) was established in 1781 (Hoover et al., 1990:146). Misi\u00f3n de San Fernando Rey de Espa\u00f1a (Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa\u00f1a) was founded in 1797 on the El Camino Real in the San Fernando Valley (Hoover et al., 1990:152). The missions became a favorite stopping place for travelers and settlers as well as a source of hides, tallow, soap, cloth, and livestock (cattle, sheep, and horses) for the Los Angeles Basin., 124178=Historic era Antelope Substation built in 1952 and a water tower which predates the substation., 87889=CA-LAN-1771 P-19-001771, 141192=Mt.

The statute makes it unlawful to excavate and remove items of archaeological interest from federal lands without a permit, and it defines the process for obtaining such a permit from the responsible federal agency. This process includes a 30-day notification to interested persons, including Indian tribes, by the agency to receive comments regarding the intended issuing of a permit. The law establishes a process for prosecuting persons who illegally remove archaeological materials from lands subject to ARPA. The law also provides for curation of archaeological artifacts, ecofacts, notes, records, photographs and other items associated with collections made on federal lands. Standards for curation are provided for in regulations at 36 CFR 79., 8045=In 1804 the first orange groves were planted at Misi\u00f3n de San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel. The first orange orchard on non-mission lands was planted by Luis Vignes in 1834 (Historical Society of Southern California, 2006). The first commercial orange grove was planted by William Wolfskill in 1841 or 1857 (Historical Society of Southern California, 2006; Beck and Haase, 1974:95; Hoover et al., 1990:164). During the 1860s and 1870s orange production was at its height and new railroads were the way for California produce to be shipped to the eastern states (Jaffe and Anusananan, 1996)., 153787=Basgall, M.

In a letter dated February 20, 2007 the NAHC reported that no sacred lands were known to the NAHC in the TRTP or the immediate vicinity of Segments 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Due to changes in the project description another request was sent on April 4, 2007 to the NAHC to consult their Sacred Lands files for lands not previously considered, including Segment 10 and Segment 10 Alternatives A and B. The NAHC replied on April 23, 2007 indicating that a number of sites known to contain human remains exist in the vicinity of the TRTP and recommending that organizations and individuals on the NAHC contacts list for Kern and Los Angeles counties be consulted.

None of the documented archaeological resources or other historic era resources are known to be listed in or to have been determined to be eligible for listing in the CRHR. None of the isolated artifacts would be eligible for CRHR listing but could indicate the possibility of other cultural remains occurring.
