It just seems like many music \"fans\" hear only vocals. Unfortunately, many on your side (Journey isn't Journey without Perry) WOULD think they were Journey if just Perry and 4 stiffs were out there. Now - we have a legit argument from you You conceding that you wouldn't consider Journey as Journey if Neal Schon weren't there and Perry was has made me respect you now.
