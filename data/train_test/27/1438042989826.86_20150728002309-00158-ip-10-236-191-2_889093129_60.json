    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Olivet is fairly expensive compared to state universities. I am responsible for paying for my education and I think ONU is worth all of the student loans that I will have to pay off. The education is top notch and the professors are very student-centered. The dorms were great to live in my freshman year and I am especially liking living in the apartments my sophomore year. Although we complain about the food a lot, it really is not as bad as it could be. There are a lot of different types of food to chose from in the main dining hall. If all else fails, you are pretty safe getting a burger from the grille and a salad. Am enjoying being here As I take more and more of my major classes, I have become more involved in my classes and they are more enjoyable. It has been great getting to know other students within my major. While I am receiving a great education, I am learning a lot about myself and life while at ONU. There are so many people around campus that I have formed great relationships with and have learned so much from. It is the people that make this school such a great place. Am learning a lot",
