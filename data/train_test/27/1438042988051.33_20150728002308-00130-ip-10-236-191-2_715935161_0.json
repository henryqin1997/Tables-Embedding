The upcoming deadlines to file an application for natural disaster protection under the NAP are March 1 and March 15. The crops for March 1 deadline are: alfalfa, clover, grass, millet, mixfg., teff, 19513=All in all we have had a decent summer with reasonable temperatures and adequate rainfall. I think the marker for the summer of 2014 can go to the weeds. So as you address some fall weeding chores you may also want to do a little preening to give some of your annuals and perennials a face-lift for fall., 29896=Plant and seed catalogs will be jamming the mailbox any day now. I always feel like January ushers in a clean slate for the garden: optimism abounds among fresh ideas and promises never to repeat a crop busting mistake are sharp in my memory. Sometimes the slate stays clean; sometimes it doesn\u2019t. Either way the next couple of months can be used to plan and prepare for the next growing season. Don\u2019t get overwhelmed by (or over indulge in) all the catalogs until you actually decide on what you want to accomplish for the year.}",
