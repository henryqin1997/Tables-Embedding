    "textBeforeTable": "The Discraft Elite Z Dyed XL is an extra long range driver with stability ratings of 0.0 to 1.5 (stable to moderately overstable). The Pro-D XL is a terrific beginner friendly golf disc that files straight with very little fade. It is easy to control and holds an almost perfect line on big throws. Good for rollers, turnover forehand/backhand shots, and as a flick roller. It is the former world distance record holder at 693 feet. Popular with players of all skill levels.

    "textAfterTable": "\"This is a great disc to learn with. The XL is one of the farthest flying discs I've ever thrown and it holds an almost perfect line on big throws. I also use it for rollers, turnover forehand/backhand shots, and when in trouble I use it for a flick roller. It is simply a far-flying, easy to control disc.\" - Kim Scott-Wood \"This is an old favorite and I still consider it to be my most controllable driver. With it's comfortable rim and deliberate flight, this disc just doesn't allow you to make big mistakes. A great driver for those just getting into the game.\" - Scott Papa Write a review Rating: Bad \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Good Your Name: Your Review: Note: HTML is not translated!
