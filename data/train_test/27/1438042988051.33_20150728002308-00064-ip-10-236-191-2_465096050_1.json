            "review Ein spannender historischer Roman ist die Fackel des Hus, wie man sich etwas in dieser Art erw\u00fcnscht, verfasst in einer Sprache eher kennenzeichend ve Ein spannender historischer Roman ist die Fackel des Hus, wie man sich etwas in dieser Art erw\u00fcnscht, verfasst in einer Sprache eher kennenzeichend vermute ich, f\u00fcr das fr\u00fcheren 20 Jahrhunderts als f\u00fcr das 15 Jahrhunderts, aber da die deutsche Sprache von sagen wir 1930 weit von derjenigen von heute entfernt liegt, und auch weil der Roman in Altschrift verfasst wurde (r\u00e4tselhaft, da der Roman erschien im Kriegsjahr 1945 drei Jahre nach der Abschaffung der alten Schriftart)bekommt der Leser wohl den Eindruck in einer alten Welt zu reisen, allerdings eine Welt des Krieges und Grausamkeit. Es l\u00e4sst sich stark vermuten, da\u00df die Kriege und Kriegsgreuel welche in diesem Roman beschrieben wurden l\u00e4ssen sich mit aktuellen Ereignissen vergleichen, aber der Roman ist tats\u00e4chlich spannend. Er wurde wohl geschrieben von deutschen Standpunkt hier: wir sind in der Zeit der Aufstand der B\u00f6hmen, angespornt von Jan Hus und seiner Reformbewegung gegen den in B\u00f6hmen lebenden deutschen. Ich wusste nicht, da\u00df Hus so n\u00e4h an der 100 Jahre sp\u00e4ter vorkommende Reformbewegung Martin Luthers stand, eher ein dessen Vorspieler als dessen Vorreiter. Die Taboristen wie sich nannten, wenn man Hans Strobl Glauben schenken will, waren Grausamer Vorreiter die franz\u00f6sische und bolschewistische Revolution\u00e4re. Nesta Webster l\u00e4sst gr\u00fc\u00dfen!

I frankly confess that I can now remember almost nothing about the story nor who the killer was. Worse I can remember no incident, character or revelation which lingers in my memory. I do recall being irritated by the fact that there are some quite modern reflections on the dangers of smoking which reveal the modern provenance of the authorship and undermines the credibility of the 1950's atmosphere. Irt is always diofficult to pin down what is wrong with the authentiicity of historical sketches, since one may not be sure what expressions were not usual but which occur in the histroical narrative offered and besides, the effect of the histroical authenticity o lack of it is a culmative one. I can only say that I did not feel that I was back in the time in which the novel is set although or possibly because the writer(s) were trying hard to put the reader there.

I hesitate before giving four stars because this writer is extremely predictable. His approach and opinions and manner of presenting historical events is (I have read five books so far I think) always the same. In this work, his strengths are especially favourably utilised. By his strengths I have in mind his pictorial presentation of historical events and persons. The opening scenes of this tale are like a painting in words. The story never flags despite the considerable erudition. WS achieves what must be a hard feat, anmely to make the historical characters of a bygone age plausible. On the other hand, I cannot imagine that I should wish to take this work of the shelves to read again. Once is enough. Now I hestitate again and wonder if three stars is enough. 3.5 stars would be exactly right I think. I find it touching that Walter Scott deeply cherishes the ideal fo chivalry and his admiration for Saladin is unfeigned and generous. We have lost the notion of chivary, especially, the notion that one honour a courageous enemy! Today and since the horrific wars of religion of the seventeeth century, the enemy seems to have been regarded as an object of contempt and extermination. Gibbon was still optimistic enough when he wrote in the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire that it would be hard for a modern reader (viz, reader of the late eighteenth century) to conceive, but at the time of the Roman Empiure, women and children were not spared by triumphant soldiery. No comment needed there I think. Once again in Walter Scott a templar plays an imporetant role in the story, as in Ivanhoe, and again he seems to be an evil and atheistic hypocrite and traitor. Walter Scott presumably welcomed the dismantling of the Temple Order. Anyway, this is a thoroughly good read, without delving very deep into the mysteries of human history or religion, alhough it touches upon both superfiically. ...more",

Scott's strength is character portrayal, where portrayal is the operative word, because he paints his colourful characters with words. They are vivid, they are larger than life. Having read several of his novels now I realise that he works according to a template of hero, damsel in distress, scheming villain, atheist and the like. however, his depiction of Charles the Bold of Burgundy and Louis XI of France known as the Spider King, is powerful and highly enjoyable. There is a fair amount of humour and much of the grotesque. Scott does not shy away from the horrors of the time without dwelling on them in any malicious manner. He interweaves fictional and historical characters, which is presumably the particular skill of the successful historical novelist. ...more",

This is a well told and straightforward (in plot, not language!) account of the future Charles' Second's escape from his pursuers. Both Cromwell and Charles Stuart (Charles II to be )have roles in this tale, which is a vivid admixture of historical romance and historical fact. There is a superb gallery of highly colourful characters. In my Melrose edition, the tale is further enlivened by illustrations by contemporaries or near contemporaries of the novelist. I especially liked George Cruikshank's depiction of \"Master Holdenough interrupted in his Vocation\" and W.P. Frith's \"Joceline Snatches a word with Phoebe Mayflower\" . In his vivid depiction of character Scott resembles Dickens, who must I feel have been influenced by him. Like Dickens, Scott is also a deeply partisan writer. There is no msitaking where the novelists sympathies lie in this book, but where I, heritically perhaps and certainly unfashionably, prefer Scott to Dickens, is that Scott never reverts to caricature. Characters portrayed sympathetically are not faultless. Sir Henry Lee, whom I suspect is to some extent a good humoured sketch by the writer of himself, is over hasty and opressively dogmatic. He is caught out in his own prejudices by deeply admiring lines cited to him until he hears that the writer is the notorious regicide John Milton, whereupon far from acknolwedging his own prejudice he reacts with violence to hsi nephew who cited the verse (not incdientally, Comus, the subject of the poem being of course virtue threateend and virtue saved, which is very much a Scott leitmotif). The depiction of the deeply troubled Cromwell and the libertine with a conscience who is Charles Stewart in this story, convey a strong sense to me at least, of authenticity and plausibility. What frustrates me in Scott's novels is that I feel that had he been less of a commercial or popular writer or whatever it was that prompted a clearly intelligent man to write yarns which seldom tax the intelligence, he would have offered much more thought-provoking material than he in fact does. I found that this novel was remarkable in presenting the case for virtue not from the standpoint of fanatical puritanism (which quite obviously Scott abhorred) but as a civil virtue and the \"right\" course to follow, without reference to religious commandments or dogma, or the injuntions of a sky pilot! Master Tomkins, the Independent, and Seventh Day Adventist (I hope I've got that right) is shown to be a sectarian whose beliefs are a pretext, but not necessarily a conscious pretext, for justifying his own libertenage, which does not stop short of rape. This is potentially more profound than Dostoyevsky's \"remove God and anything will be allowed\" and could be, probably is, very religious in its consideration and insipration. However, Scott does not develop his own most intersting themes such as this and allows instead the thrill of the ripping yarn to shift aside troubling and thought provoking philsophical methical and religious issues, and that immediatelyafter such an issue has first been raised. (We look for a build up of psychological tension in a novel by Walter Scott in vain!) Walter Scott is an extremely good writer. I am left with a slight feeling of regret however, the regret that he could, under different circumstances, have been a great one. ...more",
            "review I read this novel when I was twelve and at the time what most impressed me was the homo-erotcism which was taken for granted in the story while all ar I read this novel when I was twelve and at the time what most impressed me was the homo-erotcism which was taken for granted in the story while all around me the social ideal of the \"wife and two veg\" were held up as that of all \"normal\" and socially well adjusted persons to follow. Reading \"The Last of the Wine\" again nearly half a century later, I am amazed that I recall so little of the accounts of hardship, devestation, brutality and cruelty which features very strongly in the novel, much more strongly indeed than the erotic aspect, which is dealt with very tastefully and discretely, as befits the pre -68 optimistic but shallow time (the fifties) during which Mary Renault was writing. The writing of a novel, a form of art I think wholly unknown to the ancient Hellens, by a fictional Athenian contemporary of Socrates and Alicibiades, is an ambitious project and Mary Renault has been extremely successful. she avoids the pitfall of seeming either too colloquial and thus English, or writing in a self-consciously archaic \"oldy worldy\" style. It cannot be easy to strike the right balance in that respect but she certainly does so. The novel is a superb and easy read and although it is an easy read it neverheless present the Ancients with empathy and and understanding and intelligence and the entire novel with its historic sweep gives a fine and above all credible impression of Ancient life, civil and military, social and parsonal and the Hellenic awareness of the challenge of mutability and the passage of the soul, which until the coming of Christianity with its dogmatic solution impsoed at the point of sword, posed the great questions to the intellegent minds of the Ancients. I am no nearer as a result of reading this novel as I have ever been, from grasping how the Ancient Athenians were at once more refined than modern man and tougher too, although I am convinced they were both, and so obviously is Mary Renault: their fortitude, described here and their Stoic acceptance of the terror of life and the law of the strong, coupled with their asceticism and curiosity about the world, makes them no so much our contemporaries as our superiors. This book also fails to answer a question that has long puzzled me: how has Nietzsche of all people not been challenged to explain in what manner he conceives of Socrates as a decadent when he himself so much better answers to that description himself? But that is another story. The book is a dispassionate account of the world of those bygone masters, perhaps too dispassionate. There is next to nothing here of the passion and the pain which must have played such a significant part in the life of Mary Renault's narrator The tale is for me somewhat too discrete, too much inclined to leave unsaid what may distress the reader. One wonders if this is in the nature of the author or whether she had one ye on sales and how much indiscretion could be acceptable to her readership. Mary Renault would have known better than I the extent to which the Ancients in this respect were like the Imperial British, ever mataining a \"stiff upper lip\" in the face of terible adversity. There is always a danger (if it seen as a danger) that historical novels like this will be pointing at modern anaolgies and lessons to be drawn. There is an element of that here, in which the Spartans under Lysander might be more than a little reminiscent of the Axis powers and the Athenians the brave British fighting for democracy and the rights of man. However, this implication could have been much more clumsily and obviously made than it is here. If this is not great literature, it is certainly good literature and combines intelligence with lightness and historical credibility, no mean achievement. ...more",

            "review Unfortunately my notes on this book as well as the last volume which I was half way through, were in my rucksack, which was stolen. I was in Costa Ric Unfortunately my notes on this book as well as the last volume which I was half way through, were in my rucksack, which was stolen. I was in Costa Rica and had given the other volumes away to save on luggage weight. Conseuently this review is necessarily very short and from meory of what struck me, without references. What I can remember is that this is successfully conceived and executed epic, which integrates individual human destinies, Indian and British, with the wider historical perspective. The writer presents different perspectives from different individuals and shifts forward and backward chronologically rather like Lawrence Durrell's Alexandria Quartet. The novel covers the last years of British India. India became independent in 1947. It was described as the jewel in the crown of the Queen (Victoria). The granting of independence to India signalled a rushed exudus on the part of British colonial authorities and the beginning of a very rapid end to the largest Empire that the world has yet seen. Paul Scott has created in the character of Ronald Merreck and unforgetably sinister figure, plausible and impressive, a man who can be defined and somewhere in the book I think is defined, as a person who takes more than he gives of human happiness, whose main talent and interest is to be at the centre and manipulate. To use an old-fashioned word, he may be described as \"evil\" but he is deeply intelligent, which evil persons, \u00fcprobably wrongly are thought not to be. (People balk at the idea that Stalin or Hitler were probably above average intelligence and strenuously try to account for their success in any way other than by intelligence, preferring to use words like \"cunning\" and \"ruthless energy\"). The book has some substantial failings. It is tendentious. Although presenting itself as so to speak an objective epic, the anti-British bias is unmistakable. (There is no Indian character half as devious as Ronald Merrick in the story, for example). The writer employs many expressions and vocabulary which would have been current at the period (1940's) in which the story takes place. Not only does he employ them himself, his characters employ them, which is worse. The examples I noted were in my stolen books but I do remember a sergeant saying \"no sweat\" to mean no problem-a very modern expression surely and people keep talking of kids instead of children-kids is an Americanism which I do not think would have been used by members of the Raj at the time of the Second World War. As I say, I had plenty of other examples, unfortunately now gone in my stolen rucksack. It has been written that this is the description of the last years of the Raj, as though that is all the quartet is. In fact, the quartet can also be read as an insightful account of the ambiguities, strains and contradicitions of the prevailing social, cultural and racial hierachies pertaining to any societies in which hierachies exist whose exsitence is not rigidly stated in a code, but to some extent implicit instead. Adendum: Perry Anderson has written a review in the London Reviuew of Books Volume 34 Issue 13 on Gandhi in which I read: \"Under Bose, the dedication and courage of the Indian National Army-untiing Hindu, Muslim and Sikh combattants-in battle against the British in Manipur and Burma, won such widespread admiration in India, not least from Gandhi himslef, that prosecution of its officers had to be dropped after the war in the face of angry mass demonstrations.\" Scott's depiction givesd a very different picture, although ironically his depiction, or what we receive from him, comes via his sinister character Merrick, namely that Bose's army was ineffective and despised by the Japanese. Perry Anderson's statement further creates suspicion in my mind that Paul Scott's quartet is politically tendentious. On the other hand, maybe Perry Anderson is wrong. What do other readers think? ...more",

His characters seem to have no history not directly bearing on the story to hand. This is I suppose the \"dramatic\" quality of Conrad and Scott, which many people admire.

Are these and other slang words of Scottish origin or were they simply more common in Scott's own day? The story itself reflects a kind of \"realism\" which goes some way to explaining why the Marxist Hungarian Jewish critic Georgy Lukacs in \"The Historical Novel\" stresses the historical realism of Scott much as Marx himself stressed Balzac's realism \"depsite his conscious political attachments in favour of a dying order\". The Jacobite cause in this story, Red Gauntlet's Cause, is admirable perhaps but utterly doomed/anachronistic. The tragedy of the story is that tragedy. There are a number of very colourful charcaters in the story, including a subtley portrayed Quaker, Joshua Geddes and an eccentric and very colourful Scottish litigant called Peter Peebles, who ensure that the story never becomes dull. My father once told me that he read Scott as a young boy but that he suspected the novels had gone out of fashion. He told me that in about 1964. They have not made any kind of a come back to my knowledge since that time. It is indeed hard to deny that there is a feeling about these tales that they are somehow dated, the indulgence in excessively erudite turns of phrase to express mundane matters for example is very out of fashion.
