It's much better being at the guys or honors dorms all day., 371329=I lived in the doors in 2008 when I came in as a Freshman. I was already used to working several hours, so my dorm life was not as much as I know it could have being that I worked and attended school at the same time. I now live off campus and if that is what you decide to do, determination will be your main drive., 380828=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 13951=This school of choice I visited in April on a black college tour with joblink., 370847=Being that I worked in a restaurant, I normally had food from there. Yet, when I did eat on campus, our meals were great and now I understand that meals are healthier than what they were in 2008., 34059=The dorm rooms are not the best at TSU. However, they plan to build a new dorm by the year 2014. Hale, Rudolph and the on campus apartments are the best living spots.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students If you like to meet new, interesting people, then this is the place for you. The students and staff embrace you, and everyone is like one big family. There's always something to do on campus (talent shows, guest speakers in the forum, events in the courtyard, etc.) so you never have to worry about being bored. All in all, Tennessee State just has that homely feel. GO BIG BLUE!! Tips for prospective students Don't be afraid to meet new people. You'll make a lot of lifelong friends during your enrollment, and networking is always good for the future. Be sure to make a good impression with all of your professors. The more you communicate with them, the more familiar they become with your face and the more they are willing to help. Get involved! There are so many wonderful organizations on campus, ranging from community service, greek, and simple just for fun clubs such as those that represent your hometown. But most importantly, stay focused! Your education is your main priority; let everything else follow. Am enjoying being here TSU is my second home! There's NO place I'd rather be!!
