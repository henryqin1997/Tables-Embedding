Accordingly, all such modifications and variations are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims. In addition, according to the present invention, an information for specifying which radio channel is the reference radio channel is included at each unit of selective combination in the uplink radio channel transmitted from the mobile station. Then, at each base station, when the received reference radio channel specifying information in the current unit of selective combination indicates a radio channel of the own station, the transmission data contained within the current unit of selective combination are transmitted to the combining station via the wire transmission line, whereas when the received reference radio channel specifying information does not indicates a radio channel of the own station or when a state in which it does not indicate a radio channel of the own station is consecutively encountered for a prescribed number of times, the transmission data contained within the current unit of selective combination are not transmitted to the combining station via the wire transmission line. Consequently, it becomes possible to reduced the wire transmission traffic to the same level as that in a case of not carrying out the maximum soft handover. Also,",
