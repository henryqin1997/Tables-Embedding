Everything is special starting from the design by Robert Trent Jones, who, at the beginning of the Seventies (in 1978, Pevero Golf Club hosted the renowned Italian Open), implemented a very exclusive course scattered with terrible hazards created by nature itself more than by man and with a strong wind often blowing across it. Before, the whole area between Cala di Volpe and Golfo del Pevero was completely covered by the typical Mediterranean bushes, by rocks and natural ponds; it would have been a shame if he had destroyed this beauty. So, he have just removed some areas where the vegetation was too thick. The Pevero is considered one of the most beautiful courses in the world, is second to none thanks to the spectacular foreshortenings taken from the magnificent Costa Smeralda, stretching from Porto Rotondo to Porto Cervo. The view from the club house over the gulf of Pevero and the bay of Cala di Volpe are unforgettable. http://www.golfclubpevero.net/eng/, 41772=Notes Embarkation Information We regret that in order to perform the necessary maintenance, the yacht cannot accept guests prior to the scheduled 2 pm embarkation time. Please note: there are no air conditioned waiting facilities in the port of Civitavecchia. SeaDream highly recommends that you wait in or explore Rome before you make your way to Civitavecchia. It has come to our attention that some local taxi drivers at the airport may tell you that you can embark earlier than the scheduled 2:00 PM. Please note that this information is false and we kindly ask you to make your arrangements accordingly in order to avoid arriving at the pier prior to 2:00 PM. We thank you for your understanding. Some limo and transfer companies found on the web do not have the proper permits to enter the inner port area. Please double check with your service provider to see if they can actually take you all the way to the yacht. In some cases you may be dropped off at the port entrance and would need to take a shuttle bus with your luggage. Travel Documents All guests must be in possession of a valid passport, necessary visas and health documents as required by all countries visited. These travel documents are the responsibility of the individual guest., 69558=Copyright 2001 - 2014 SeaDream Yacht Club. All rights reserved. Change Currency, 38879=This land adventure has it all! In love or not, we recommend that you sign up early for this annual favorite! Begin your discovery of \"The Island of Love\" by stepping from your SeaDream yacht into a motor launch to explore the island's dramatic eastern coastline. See the famous Faraglioni Rocks, cruise into a coral cave, and explore the rugged vistas of Capri's tiny coves. As you step back ashore, head next to the high village of Anacapri in high style via your waiting convertible touring car (Specifically made for the island of Capri \u2013 It\u2019s a Caprisian Convertible!). Once in Anacapri, board a chairlift that takes you skimming over vineyards to the top of Mt. Solaro and its magnificent vistas. After some free time to wander in Anacapri, hop back in your car to wind down to Capri town, where you may explore the lush Cesar August Gardens with your guide before either returning to the yacht, or wandering through the shops and restaurants on your own. This is an excellent overview of one of the most visited islands in the world \u2013 enjoy every second of it!, 41155=The yacht is scheduled to be docked at the port of Civitavecchia at one of the following berths: 10, 11, 12 South or 12 North. After entering the port area through the South Gate, you should see a large road sign indicating at which berth the SeaDream Yacht is located. Port Agent Information Hugo Trumpy Lungo Porto Gramsci, 19/4 00053 Civitavecchia, Italy Tel: (+39) 0766 3621 Fax: (+39) 0766 501515 Email: cruise.ops@htrumpycv.com Distance Airport to Port Rome (Leonardo da Vinci, aka Fiumicino) airport to the port of Civitavecchia is 47 miles. Please allow 45 minutes to 1 hour transit time., 35265=You and your fellow SeaDream guests will board the local boat for an unforgettable trip along the extraordinary coastline of Bonifacio. Discover the dramatic sight of the citadel and the upper town; you will get the best perspective of its buildings overhanging the magnificent chalky cliffs which look like they are about to topple into the sea. Onboard the motor boat you will navigate out through the narrow harbor entrance called the Goulet, passed the deep rocky inlets with their clear aquamarine waters and the magical Grotte du Sdragonatu which is entered through a narrow and low passage. The cave with its gloriously colored seabed is a single huge chamber with a hole in the roof shaped like a map of Corsica Further along; reach the Lavezzi Island from which the whole archipelago gets its name and which is formed by a group of small barren uninhabited granite islands located 10km southeast of Bonifacio. One hour will be allocated to enjoy its beautiful shell sandy beaches and azure colored sea and to linger on this island which is classified as a nature reserve since 1982. The island is home to several rare species of wild flowers such as yellow-horned poppy and white sea daffodil. On the way back pass close to the Cavallo Island, pass the Pointe de Sperone and come back through the calanque and the cliffs before reaching the attractive and lively marina in Bonifacio., 30872=This fun, varied and interesting land adventure is an annual favorite among our guests. It is an excellent opportunity to not only get to know your way around for independent explorations later in the day but your knowledgeable and experienced guide will provide you with a historic insight and context to let you appreciate this beautiful town to its fullest. Begin your visit with a mini-tram ride which will take you up to the oldest part of Bonifacio to provide you with a quick overview of this charming town, passing the Bosco quarter with the St. Francis convent and the strange, but fascinating cemetery dedicated to the mariners with wonderful mausoleums displaying a jumble of architectural styles. On clear day you may also enjoy a panoramic view of Corsica's closest neighbor the Italian island, Sardinia. Then pass the church St Dominique, a rare example of Corsican gothic architecture, built in 1270, most probably by the Templars. Following the orientation by mini-tram, continue your visit of Bonifacio on foot through tiny, narrow streets bordered with high granite houses. Pass the church of St. Marie Majeure, with its mixture of Romanesque and Baroque styles dated from 14th century. Continue through the heart of the historical part of town to the Two Emperors street where Napoleon Bonaparte and Charles V spent a few days, the Place des Armes, the Jardins des Vestiges and then to the old market where there is a viewpoint over the 230 ft. cliffs on top of which Bonifacio has been built! Return to the mini-train for the journey from the Citadel back to the port, where a local boat stands ready to show you the grottos at the base of the white cliffs. Catch a glimpse of the clearness of the water and, weather condition permitting, enter the magnificent Grotto Sdragonatu the largest of the three caves, which resembles the shape of Corsica. Inside you discover the beautiful colors of amethyst, indigo and gold, the clear water and the rock walls with stalactites and arches. Continue your visit, passing St Antoine and St Barthelemy Caves, the staircase of the King of Aragon carved in the limestone cliffs. Looking south you may even have the opportunity to see Corsica's closest neighbor the Italian island Sardinia, located about 14 kms/9 miles, off in the distance. After this boat ride of about 45 minutes, return to the pier and your SeaDream yacht., 44206=Take the opportunity today to explore the Emerald Coast, probably one of the most exclusive and beautiful areas of all of the Sardinian Islands. Discovered and developed by the Aga Khan in 1961, the Emerald Coast is a sanctuary where natural beauty and personal privacy are preserved, where service is still an art and where the sun shines for more than 3000 hours each year on its quiet and sandy beaches. Your guide will meet you on the pier for a brisk walk from the harbor to the coaches waiting at the upper piazzetta. Enjoy a beautiful drive from Poltu Quatu along the scenic and impressive coastline, passing lovely beaches and posh villages. The first stop is at Baia Sardinia, a new holiday resort near the Emerald Coast. After a short visit your motor coach leaves the coastline behind and heads toward one of the most beautiful areas of northern Sardinia: The hills of San Pantaleo surrounded by the impressive granite rocks of the most various forms. Passing through this small Sardinian village that provides you with a glimpse of the local lifestyle. Drive by elegant properties like the lavish Cala di Volpe Hotel, a Moorish style resort with more marble floored restaurants, bars and boutiques than a small town. See the famous Romazzino Hotel, a fantasy in white perched on a hill, draped with bougainvillea. The next stop is at Porto Cervo: There is time to stroll along the streets and squares of what is considered to be the hub of Costa Smeralda: visit the famous Piazzetta; admire the elegant shops and the charming restaurants and cafes. After a short introduction by guide, enjoy some leisure time for shopping. On your return, stop briefly to visit a local outdoor cafe for a tasting of the local vino and cheeses after which you continue the drive along the last part of the coastline that has to be seen by the visitors to complete the image of the Emerald Coast and return to your yacht., 25607=SeaDream is pleased to advise you that in order to enhance your visit to this incredible site, your local guide will speak to you directly through the use of an audio head set, referred to as a \"whisper\". It allows you to listen to the wonderful detailed commentary of your excellent guides without straining to hear over other visitors and noises. We hope you will take advantage of this technology and join your fellow SeaDreamers on this unforgettable visit. From the SeaDream quay in Amalfi, travel along the panoramic coastline and peninsula roads to the remarkably well preserved ruins of Pompeii. Originally settled by indigenous people before the 8th century BC, and later ruled by Etruscans, Greeks, and Samnites, Pompeii became a thriving commercial center under Roman rule. It was a city full of shops, markets and town houses, with paved streets, wide sidewalks, a stadium, two theaters, temples and baths. Then, shortly after noon on August 24 in 79AD, live cinder and ash from Mount Vesuvius covered the entire city. The community of 30,000 people was effectively embalmed. The material thrown out by the volcano was lighter than lava and enabled the city to be covered, with architectural detail, furnishings, household articles, and even foodstuffs and artwork preserved intact. Walk through the streets rutted by chariot tracks, past the ancient forum, the homes of the wealthy, and the shops of the common man. Caught in the moment of death, view body casts of the eruption's victims seemingly come alive in their struggle for breath; their desire to protect loved ones and their doomed attempts to escape. Those who visit Pompeii cannot help but be amazed and moved by this remarkable ruin and the story it tells of a city captured at the height of its power and the moment of its death., 43262=Our Destination Specialists \u201cDDP Incentive\u201d have prepared pre and post voyage options for your consideration.

Robinson, for Robert Trent Jones. The course is just a few miles up the coast from our dock in Bonifacio. The course is built over rugged terrain and rocky headlands which makes for a challenging day of golf. The last seven holes play down towards the ocean and the sandy beach of Sperone. The views over the azure waters of the straits of Bonifacio and the Maddalena islands are spectacular., 28665=Enjoy a panoramic drive climbing up from the harbor in Amalfi to Ravello, one of the most famous and popular locations on the UNESCO awarded Amalfi coast. Ravello has long attracted writers, artists and celebrities, among them Greta Garbo, Gore Vidal (current resident), Richard Wagner and D.H. Lawrence, who was inspired to write Lady Chatterley's Lover here. The winding route along the famed Amalfi Drive brings you to Ravello's main square, where you set eyes on the Duomo whose linear Romanesque facade is graced with a valuable bronze door made in 1179 by Barissano da Trani. To the right stands the 13th- century bell tower. You'll visit Villa Rufolo, a spectacular complex formed by the main palazzo, built in the second half of the 13th century, and various buildings in Arabian-Sicilian style on a wide terrace facing the gulf. Having entered the smaller 14th-century tower, continue along a small avenue flanked by cypresses and reach the Moorish courtyard, decorated with friezes and arabesques. Passing the knights room, the picturesque belvedere opens up, a luxurious garden with pines, cypresses and exotic plants. After exploring the villa, enjoy some free time to browse and shop among the friendly inhabitants of Ravello before returning to the pier in Amalfi., 53318=SeaDream is pleased to advise you that in order to enhance your visit to this incredible site, your local guide will speak to you directly through the use of an audio head set, referred to as a \"whisper\".
