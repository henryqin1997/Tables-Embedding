As mentioned above the physician can see the image of the target on the ultrasound screen and, as an additional feature the required needle trajectory may also be shown on the screen, next to the image of the target. The controller 32 is provided with at least three spaced apart infrared-ultrasonic transceivers for communication with the transponders 33, 33' and 33\", and with the needle guide. These transceivers are not shown in the drawing as known to the art. The three transponders on the transducer as well as the two transponders on the needle guide have each a different triggering code corresponding to the code emitted by the transceivers, each transceiver triggering the corresponding transponder by a coded infrared signal, whereupon the transponder emits an ultrasonic signal to the transceiver. These signals are computed so as to indicate the exact position of the transducer and of the needle guide and to energize the latter to direct the needle onto the target, the operation being identical with that described with reference to FIGS. 1 through 3. As an alternative connection between transducer 4 and the controller 32 as well as between controller and needle guide 5 is by",
