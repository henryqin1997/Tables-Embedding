Under its policy of \"one nation, one language\", only the Nepali language was promoted, and all the other languages of Nepal were suppressed as \"ethnic\" or \"local\" languages.[54], 57900=In Gorkha, the Bhairav Temple at Pokharithok Bazaar contains an inscription dated Nepal Sambat 704 (1584 AD), which is 185 years before the conquest of the Kathmandu Valley by the Gorkha Kingdom. The Palanchowk Bhagawati Temple situated to the east of Kathmandu contains an inscription recording a land donation dated Nepal Sambat 861 (1741 AD).[66], 30280=An example of the language of the ancient period is provided by the following line from the palm-leaf manuscript from Uku Bahah which dates from 1114 AD. It is a general discussion of business transactions., 26219=According to the linguist Glover, Newari and Chepang language must have diverged around 2200 BC. It is estimated that Newari shares 28% of its vocabulary with Chepang. At the same time, a very large and significant proportion of Newari vocabulary is Indo-European in origin, on one estimate more than 50% indicating an influence of at least 1600 years from Indo-European languages:first from Sanskrit, Maithili, Persian, and Urdu; and Today from Hindi, Nepali and English.[23], 54856=In 1997, Kathmandu Metropolitan City declared that its policy to officially recognize Nepal Bhasa would be revived. The rest of the city governments in the Kathmandu Valley announced that they too would recognize it. However, critics petitioned the Supreme Court to have the policy annulled, and in 1999, the Supreme Court quashed the decision of the local bodies as being unconstitutional.[61] Newar was thus pushed out once again., 42537=In 1909, Bajracharya published the first printed book using movable type. Shastri wrote a grammar of the language entitled Nepal Bhasa Vyakaran, the first one in modern times. It was published from Kolkata in 1928. His other works include Nepal Bhasa Reader, Books 1 and 2 (1933) and an alphabet book Nepali Varnamala (1933).[46], 27373=Inscriptions in Newar emerged from the 12th century, the palm-leaf manuscript from Uku Bahah being the first example.[25] By the 14th century, Newar had become an administrative language as shown by the official proclamations and public notices written in it. The first books, manuals, histories and dictionaries also appeared during this time. The Gopalarajavamsavali, a history of Nepal, appeared in 1389 AD.[26] From the 14th century onwards, an overwhelming number of stone inscriptions in the Kathmandu Valley, where they are an ubiquitous element at heritage sites, are in Newar.[27], 29163=The period 1505-1847 AD was a golden age for Newar literature. Poetry, stories, epics and dramas were produced in great numbers during this time which is known as the Classical Period. Since then it entered a period of decline due to official disapproval and oftentimes outright attempts to stamp it out., 45055=The years 1941-1945 are known as the jail years for the large number of authors who were imprisoned for their literary or political activities. They were a productive period and resulted in an outpouring of literary works., 46567=The efforts of Newar authors coincided with the revival of Theravada Buddhism in Nepal, which the rulers disliked equally. In 1946, the monks who had been exiled by the Ranas in 1944 for teaching Buddhism and writing in Newar were allowed to return following international pressure. Restrictions on publication were relaxed, and books could be published after being censored. The monks wrote wide-ranging books on Buddhism and greatly enriched the corpus of religious literature.[49][50], 59125=Outside Nepal, Newar has been used in Tibet. Official documents and inscriptions recording votive offerings made by Newar traders have been found in Lhasa.[68] A copper plate dated Nepal Sambat 781 (1661 AD) recording the donation of a tympanum is installed at the shrine of Chhwaskamini Ajima (Tibetan: Palden Lhamo) in the Jokhang Temple.[69], 35293=Moreover, hostility towards the language from neighbours grew following massive migration into the Kathmandu Valley leading to the indigenous Newars becoming a minority.[40] During the period 1952 to 1991, the percentage of the valley population speaking Newar dropped from 74.95% to 43.93%.[41] The Nepal Bhasa movement arose as an effort to save the language., 11467=Newar was Nepal's administrative language from the 14th to the late 18th centuries. Since the beginning of the 20th century, Newar has suffered from official suppression.[6] During the period 1952 to 1991, the percentage of the population in the Kathmandu Valley speaking Newar dropped from 75% to 44%,[7] and Newar culture and language are under threat.[8] The language has been listed as being \"definitely endangered\" by UNESCO.[9], 34120=Newar suffered heavily under the repressive policy of the Rana dynasty (1846\u20131951 AD) when the regime attempted to wipe it out.[34][35] In 1906, legal documents written in Newar were declared unenforceable, and any evidence in the language was declared null and void.[36] The rulers forbade literature in Newar, and writers were sent to jail.[37] In 1944, Buddhist monks who wrote in the language were expelled from the country.[38][39], 115165=The use of \u0919 and \u091e was very common in the old form of language. However, in the new form, specially in writing, the use of these characters has diminished. The use of \u0923, \u0924, \u0925, \u0926, \u0927, \u0928, \u0936, \u0937, \u0915\u094d\u0937, \u0924\u094d\u0930, \u091c\u094d\u091e are limited by the new grammar books to the loan words only., 24206=Newar is spoken by over a million people in Nepal according to the 2001 census., 55874=A second People's Movement in 2006 ousted the Shah dynasty and Nepal became a republic which gave the people greater linguistic freedom. The 2007 Interim Constitution states that the use of one's native language in a local body or office shall not be barred.[62] However, this has not happened in practice. Organizations with names in Newar are not registered, and municipality officials refuse to accept applications written in the language.[63][64], 52276=Birat Nepal Bhasa Sahitya Sammelan Guthi (Grand Nepal Bhasa Literary Conference Trust), formed in 1962 in Bhaktapur, and Nepal Bhasa Manka Khala, founded in 1979 in Kathmandu, are some of the prominent organizations that emerged during this period to struggle for language rights. The names of these organizations also annoyed the government which, on one occasion in 1979, changed the name of Brihat Nepal Bhasa Sahitya Sammelan Guthi in official media reports.[57], 58536=In Bhojpur in east Nepal, an inscription at the Bidyadhari Ajima Temple dated Nepal Sambat 1011 (1891 AD) records the donation of a door and tympanum. The Bindhyabasini Temple in Bandipur in west Nepal contains an inscription dated Nepal Sambat 950 (1830 AD) about the donation of a tympanum.[67], 21582=The earliest occurrences of the name Nep\u0101lbh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 can be found in the manuscripts Narad Sanhita, dated 1380 AD, and Amarkosh, dated 1389 AD.[10][11] Since then, the name has been used widely on inscriptions, manuscripts, documents and books., 29562=Newar can be classified into the old and new eras. Although there is no specific demarcation between the two, the period 1846-1941 AD during the Rana regime is taken as the dividing period between the two.[29], 22055=In the 1920s, the name of the language known as Khas Kura,[12] Gorkhali or Parbatiya[13] was changed to Nepali,[14] and the language began to be officially referred to as Newari while the Newars continued using the original term.[15] Conversely, the term Gorkhali in the former national anthem entitled \"Shreeman Gambhir\" was changed to Nepali in 1951.[16], 41464=The period between 1909 to 1941 is considered as the renaissance era of Newar.[45] During this period, a few authors braved official disapproval and started writing, translating, educating and restructuring the language. Writers Nisthananda Bajracharya, Siddhidas Mahaju, Jagat Sundar Malla and Yogbir Singh Kansakar are honored as the Four Pillars of Nepal Bhasa. Shukraraj Shastri and Dharmaditya Dharmacharya were also at the forefront of the renaissance., 49010=Following the overthrow of the Rana dynasty and the advent of democracy in 1951, restrictions on publication in Newar were removed. Books, magazines and newspapers appeared. A daily newspaper Nepal Bhasa Patrika began publication in 1955.[52] Textbooks were published and Newar was included in the curriculum. Nepal Rastriya Vidhyapitha recognized Newar as an alternative medium of instruction in the schools and colleges affiliated to it., 54124=After the 1990 People's Movement that brought the Panchayat system to an end, the languages of Nepal enjoyed greater freedom.[59] The 1990 constitution recognized Nepal as a multiethnic and multilingual country. The Nepali language in the Devanagari script was declared the language of the nation and the official language. Meanwhile, all the languages spoken as native languages in Nepal were named national languages.[60], 49691=Literary societies like Nepal Bhasa Parisad were formed and Chwasa Pasa returned from exile.[31] In 1958, Kathmandu Municipality passed a resolution that it would accept applications and publish major decisions in Newar in addition to the Nepali language.[53], 51087=In 1963, Kathmandu Municipality's decision to recognize Newar was revoked. In 1965, the language was also banned from being broadcast over Radio Nepal.[55] Those who protested against the ban were put in prison, including Buddhist monk Sudarshan Mahasthavir., 33070=Following the advent of the Shahs, the Gorkhali language became the court language,[32] and Newar was replaced as the language of administration.[33] However, Newar continued to remain in official use for a time as shown by the 1775 treaty with Tibet which was written in it.[14] A few of the new rulers cultivated the language. Kings Prithvi Narayan Shah, Rana Bahadur and Rajendra Bikram Shah composed poetry and wrote plays in it., 43044=Mahaju's Ramayan and books on morals and ethics, Malla's endeavors to impart education in the native language and other literary activities marked the renaissance. Dharmacharya published the first magazine in Newar Buddha Dharma wa Nepal Bhasa (\"Buddhism and Nepalese\") from Kolkata in 1925. Also, the renaissance marked the beginning of the movement to get official recognition for the name \"Nepal Bhasa\" in place of the Khas imposed term \"Newari\"., 37426=Newars have been fighting to save their language in the face of opposition from the government and hostile neighbours from the time of the repressive Rana regime till today.[42] The movement arose against the suppression of the language that began with the rise of the Shah dynasty in 1768 AD, and intensified during the Rana regime (1846\u20131951) and Panchayat system (1960\u20131990).[43]}",
