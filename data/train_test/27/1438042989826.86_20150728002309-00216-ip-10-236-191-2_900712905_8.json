            "Although I would have rather been at a University like I had initially planned I like the schools atmosphere. They welcome you into the school and it is easy to get around. Not to mention all the money I'm saving.",
            "As a first time college student at ELAC I found out first hand how hard it is to add classes. Although it is hard the teachers there are great and they have many programs to help you transfer in 2 years."
