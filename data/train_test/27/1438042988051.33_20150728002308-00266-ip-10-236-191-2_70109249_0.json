Description of \"Figure 10-1 Resources Available in Spaces\" Figure 10-1 Resources Available in Spaces Spaces categorizes resources under the following categories: Structure, Look and Layout, and Mashups. Figure 10-4 shows the various types of resources available under each of these categories. 10.1.1 Introducing Resources Section 10.1.5, \"Viewing Information About a Resource\" Section 10.1.4, \"Accessing Resources\" Section 10.1.3, \"Permissions Required to Work with Resources\" Section 10.1.2, \"Understanding Application-Level and Space-Level Resources\" Section 10.1.1, \"Introducing Resources\" This section provides an overview of the various resources and the permissions required to work with them, and describes how you can access resources. It includes the following subsections: Though Spaces comes with an out-of-the-box application framework, it is a constantly evolving application. Users with appropriate privileges can continue to customize it by creating and applying various types of resources that define the structure, look and feel, and the content of the entire Spaces application or",
    "textAfterTable": "10.1.2 Understanding Application-Level and Space-Level Resources Out-of-the-box, Spaces provides various built-in resources at the application level and the space level (Home spaces or any other spaces). You cannot modify or download built-in resources. To meet your business requirements, you can create custom resources at the application level or at the space level. At both these levels, the resources available and their functionality are the same. The difference between application- and space-level resources is that of scope: Application-level resources are available for use to all spaces, unless a space has been specifically excluded. Space-level resources are available for use only in the space in which they are created. By default, application-level resource settings, such as the page template, skin, resource catalog, and navigation model, are applied to all spaces. However, in a space, you can choose to use the default application-level resource settings or specify your own resource settings. If your space uses application-level settings, any changes to an application-level setting are reflected in your space too. For example, consider that your application uses the Fusion FX skin, and there are two spaces in your application, SpaceA and SpaceB. By default, both your spaces will use the Fusion FX skin. Consider that you configure the application to use the skin named Dew, and SpaceB to use the Mist skin. Now, SpaceA, which is still using",
