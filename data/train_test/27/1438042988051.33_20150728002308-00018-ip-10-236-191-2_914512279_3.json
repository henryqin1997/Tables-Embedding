It is an interdisciplinary program with two options. One option is Environmental Systems Engineering and it is concerned with the impact of industrial activities on the environment and the choice of cost-effective remediation strategies. The other option is Environmental Health and Safety Engineering and it is concerned with safe and healthful design of industrial systems such that workers are protected from potentially high risk exposures associated with today's industries. The program is unique as it is designed to address critical environmental, safety and health problems of the basic industries such as those involved in the extraction, conversion, and utilization of energy and mineral resources. The courses are sequenced so that students acquire an appropriate blend of theory, applications, and design and are equipped with the fundamentals necessary to maintain lifelong professional growth. Graduates are prepared to enter both the private and public sectors as environmental systems engineers or health and safety engineers or to pursue further education at the graduate level. During the first two years, the program shares many common features (e.g., mathematics, chemistry, physics, and engineering mechanics) with other more traditional engineering disciplines. Students then take a series of special courses that introduce engineering concepts in the extractive and process industries. Process engineering and a variety of solid-solid, solid-fluid, and fluid-fluid separations play a major and often dominant role in the prevention and/or remediation of environmental damage or the prevention of health and safety hazards resulting from industrial activity. Students then specialize in the particular problems associated with air, land, or water, environmental health and safety engineering or select a hybrid program. Specialization is accomplished through a combination of additional designated courses and selection from an extensive list of relevant elective courses, which may include a senior thesis. The curriculum is structured so as to integrate design concepts into the various subject areas covered in the program. The human, societal, economic, ethical, and regulatory aspects of the industrial impact on the environment and on the workers themselves are addressed through a combination of specific courses and components of other more general courses. This aspect of the program is designed to provide students with a deeper understanding, both of the impact of environmental degradation on society and of the effects on industrial activity of society's demands for protection of workers and the environment. The program culminates with the capstone design course, which is an integrated, problem-based, multi-faceted project in which students, working in a team setting, utilize fundamental concepts to design an environmental remediation system or an environmental health and safety protection system (or incorporate these design requirements into other associated designs). The integration of knowledge and skills acquired during the course of study enables graduates of Penn State's Environmental Systems Engineering program to: * Enter the private or public sectors as environmental systems engineers to solve a broad range of environmental or health and safety problems associated with the resource recovery and general and process industries or pursue an advanced degree. * Address critical environmental or health and safety problems of the basic industries, especially those involved with the extraction, conversion, and utilization of energy and mineral resources; design effective and economic engineering systems to alleviate such problems, individually and in a team setting; and communicate the results effectively. * Determine the impact of environmental pollution control on the viability of industrial operations, including health and safety, social, and ethical aspects, and an awareness of environmental regulations; evaluate novel strategies for minimizing pollution control costs in the process industries. * Recognize the need to maintain professional competency and the value of life-long learning.}",
