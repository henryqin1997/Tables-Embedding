However, preliminary unweighted Vermont data suggest childhood prevalence may be higher (77.3 per 1,0002). Nationally, childhood asthma prevalence of 120.6 per 1,000 in 19983 with a 95 percent confidence interval (CI)[113.8,127.5], is approximately double or triple the prevalence estimated for Vermont children. The rate of asthma hospitalization4 for Vermont children under 15 years of age decreased significantly from 1997 (1.2 per 1,000 95%CI [0.99,1.37]) to 1998 (0.77 per 1,000 95%CI [0.61,0.93])(see Figure 1). Vermont rates were approximately one-third of the U.S. hospitalization rates.3 There were no asthma deaths among Vermont children under age 15 during the time period 1994-1998.5, 12750=Clinical laboratories are strongly encouraged to send all Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli O157:H7 and Listeria isolates to the Vermont Department of Health Laboratory for reference testing. The state Laboratory provides serotyping for reference cultures of enteric bacterial agents and molecular subtyping for Salmonella and E.coli O157:H7 (described below). Salmonella serotyping alone does not usually provide sufficient differentiation for epidemiologic purposes. The majority of Salmonella infections, both nationally and in Vermont, are caused by the two most common serotypes, Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella enteriti-dis. In Vermont, for the year 2000, S. typhimurium accounted for 49 (44.5%) Salmonella isolates, followed by S. enteriti-dis with 20 (18.1%) isolates. Most of these cases did not demonstrate an epidemiologic connection., 19800=The major preventive intervention is immunization. Whole-cell pertussis vaccine was developed in the 1940s, and acellular pertussis vaccine, which has fewer associated adverse effects, was licensed in 1991. Nationally, the number of pertussis cases has decreased from pre-vaccine levels of greater than 200,000 cases per year to a low of just over 1,000 cases in 1976. Since the mid-1990s, however, the number of cases has been increasing., 24760=The 1999-2000 average prevalence of asthma in adult Vermonters was 7.5 percent with a 95%CI [6.8,8.3]. Men had a significantly lower prevalence of asthma (6.2%, 95%CI [5.2,7.1]) than women (8.9%, 95%CI [7.8,10.0]). In 1998, the 65+ year old age group became the Vermont population with the highest hospitalization rates for asthma (1.0 per 1,000 95%CI [0.77,1.22])(see Figure 1), but the rate was significantly lower than the U.S. hospitalization rate (1.8 per 1,000)3 for this age group. In 1998, seven adult Vermonters died from asthma. The average age-adjusted6 mortality rate for the state (1994-98) was 1.2 per 100,000, lower than the 1998 U.S. rates for white race only (1.7 per 100,000) and all races combined (2.0 per 100,000)., 7164=In Vermont, campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis, E. coli O157:H7 infections, yersiniosis, and shigellosis are the most commonly reported foodborne diseases (see below). While these infections can be transmitted by other routes, such as person-to-person contact or handling animals, foodborne transmission is the primary risk. Less common foodborne illnesses reported between 1996 and 2000 in Vermont have included listeriosis (12 cases), Vibrio vulnificus infection and typhoid fever (Salmonella typhi), two cases each; and one case of trichinellosis., 13749=The ability to link foodborne bacterial infections has been greatly enhanced through the use of a molecular technology called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) testing. The Vermont Department of Health began PFGE testing in April 2000 and currently performs PFGE on all nontyphoidal Salmonella serotypes and E. coli 0157:H7 isolates received at the Health Department Laboratory. PFGE was performed on all isolates for both Salmonella and E coli O157:H7 received since July 1, 1999 to create a reference database containing all Vermont patterns seen during that time period. Each new pattern is compared to the database and given a pattern designation depending upon whether or not it matches an existing pattern in the database. All matching patterns are given the same pattern designation, allowing the microbiologist to detect clusters or outbreaks more readily., 31646=Vermont Department of Health | 108 Cherry Street | Burlington, VT 05402 Voice: 802-863-7200 | In Vermont 800-464-4343 | Fax: 802-865-7754 | TTY/TDD: Dial 711 first Health Care Provider Infectious Disease Reporting: 802-863-7240 or 800-640-4374 Contact Us | District Offices | Accessibility | External Links | Privacy | Web Browser A Vermont Government Website \u00a92015 Vermont Department of Health. All rights reserved., 30535=Vermont has a new death certificate form to be used for all deaths occurring after January 1, 2002. The new Vermont Death Certificate includes a question in the Certifier section regarding the contribution of tobacco to death. New forms and instructions were mailed December 17, 2001. If you did, 18105=From January, 1998, through September, 2001, 457 confirmed cases of pertussis were reported in Vermont. Twenty-nine of these cases were infants less than 1 year old (eight in 1998, seven in 1999, 10 in 2000, and four so far in 2001). Illness in this age group is associated with the potential for significant complications, such as prolonged apnea, and an increased risk of death. Fourteen (48%) of the 29 infants required hospitalization, with hospital stays ranging from two to 50 days. Most (26, or 90%) of the infants were less than 6-months-old (three were <1-month-old, 11 were 1-month-old, two were 2-months-old, three were 3-months-old, one was 4-months-old, and six were 5-months-old). These infants would not have been fully immunized at the time of their illnesses even if their immunizations were up-to-date., 17870=Between Novemter 13 and Deeember 6, 2001, at least 11 confirmed cases of pertussis were identified in Vermont students. Many more students are being evaluated, treated for cough illness, or prophylaxed as contacts., 11134=The primer recommends stool cultures if a patient is febrile, has bloody diarrhea, has severe abdominal pain, has many fecal leukocytes in the stool, is immunocompromised, or if the illness is clinically severe or persistent. Public health benefits from health care providers having a low threshold for requesting stool cultures. Any individual patient seen could be the index case for a foodborne disease outbreak, since documented cases represent only a small portion of foodborne illness. In the 1998 Vermont Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey randomly selected adults were asked if they had experienced diarrhea in the past 30 days; 13.4 percent (n=407 ) said that they had. However among those people only 66 (14.6%) reported contacting their health care provider about the diarrhea, 25 were asked to submit a stool sample and 22 actually submitted a test. Thus, testing was only done on 5.4 percent of those who were ill., 8521=In addition to specific diseases, any unexpected pattern of cases or suspected cases of illness, which might indicate an outbreak, are reportable under Vermont\u2019s Communicable Disease regulations. Between 1996 and 2000, there were 21 foodborne outbreaks investigated in Vermont, with between one and seven outbreaks investigated per year. Ten outbreaks of acute gastrointestinal illness of unknown etiology occurred, most probably due to viral agents. Other agents involved in outbreaks included Salmonella (six outbreaks), cyclospora (two) hepatitis A (one), E. coli O157:H7 (one), and Campylobacter (one)., 28886=According to \u201cA Chronological History of the Vermont Department of Health 1872-1957,\u201d compiled in May 1957 by Viola Russell, MD, then Director of the Division of Maternal and Child Health, the Division of Communicable Disease Control was organized in 1926 to \u201cpick up the Venereal Disease Program with matching federal funds for an expanding general epidemiological program.\u201d Infectious Disease Epidemiology now resides within the Division of Health Surveillance. Our responsibilities still include surveillance, prevention, and control of venereal diseases (now known as sexually transmitted infections), such as gonorrhea and syphilis, plus others not known or diagnosable in 1926 (such as chlamydia and HIV/AIDS). We are also responsible for surveillance, prevention, and control of vaccine-preventable diseases (such as measles, pertussis, and varicella); zoonoses (such as rabies and Lyme disease); emerging infectious diseases (such as West Nile Virus); tuberculosis; hepatitis; foodborne illnesses (such as Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7); waterborne illnesses (such as giardia and Cryptosporidium); and other infectious diseases of varying incidence. A new task for us is response to agents of bioterrorism., 31188=Vermont Department of Health Division of Health Surveillance P.O. Box 70 Burlington, VT 05402-0070 Agency of Human Services Jan K. Carney, MD, MPH Commissioner, 10433=In January 2001, the CDC published \u201cDiagnosis and Management of Foodborne Illnesses: A Primer for Physicians.\u201d3 This document is currently available on the Ameri-can Medical Association\u2019s website at www.ama-assn.org/ama/ pub/category/3707.html. The primer includes a section on general clinical considerations, followed by foodborne illness tables for bacterial, viral, parasitic, and non-infectious agents. For each agent the tables provide information on incubation periods, signs and symptoms, duration of illness, frequently associated foods, laboratory testing, and treatment options., 16380=PFGE patterns are useful in providing an early focus for an investigation. For example, during the summer of 2000, the Health Department received reports of three cases of E. coli O157:H7 in a two-day period. Two cases were children living in the same town; the third case was another child attending a camp in a neighboring town. It is very unusual to have three cases of this infection reported in such a short time frame. The patients were quickly interviewed in order to determine a possible common source of infection; no obvious connections were identified. However, PFGE results were soon available, and indicated that despite the clustering in time, these cases had distinct patterns. This allowed Epidemiology to separately investigate the camp. Other ill children were identified, and the subsequent outbreak investigation implicated ground meat as the probable source of infection.}",

Foodborne disease is a common problem in the United States, causing an estimated 76 million illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths annually.1 Gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are the most common presenting symptoms, though some agents cause neurologic or nonspecific symptoms. Nationally the most common pathogens associated with foodborne illness are Norwalk-like viruses; these illnesses are estimated to account for approximately two-thirds of foodborne illnesses.2 Because viral testing is not commonly done for foodborne illness, most available data relate to bacterial pathogens.

Physicians and other health care providers play a critical role in surveillance for foodborne disease problems. Considering the possibility of foodborne disease and reporting suspicious cases or clusters of cases to the Health Department allows for the immediate investigation of a possible foodborne disease outbreak. Stool tests might confirm a specific bacterial or parasitic etiologic agent. For the individual patient, identification of the specific agent causing illness is important for the appropriate management of the illness. For public health, identifying the causative agents of individual illnesses provides data for identifying disease trends and disease burden. Surveillance for foodborne disease is also the basis for recognizing outbreaks. Prompt investigation of outbreaks can lead to the identification and elimination of harmful food items or risky food handling practices. Immediate benefits can include temporary removal of ill persons from high-risk occupations, provision of treatment of contacts when appropriate (e.g., immunoglobulin for prevention of hepatitis A), and reinforcement of measures such as handwashing to decrease transmission to household",
