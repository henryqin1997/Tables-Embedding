Transfer News (Tuesday July 28 2015), 13815=Kozak Brace Almost Sinks Wolves (Wednesday July 29 2015), 42639=Would it be folly for Villa to try to do something audacious and try to grab England star David Beckham? Would it help put us on the map, get bums on seats, generate a bit of excitement and also help us help him in his bid to be fit and ready for the World Cup in 2010 which is bound to be his England swan-song? Seriously, why not? If you don't ask, you don't get!? A report in the News of the World by Rob Beasley says that if Beckham see's his 'dream return' to AC Milan fall though, he would consider a move back to the Premiership. Where better than Villa - amongst those likely to be interested - as we've said many times, Villa is popular with the England manager Fabio Capello and I'm sure Beckham could teach our youngsters a thing or two and attract some good attention to Villa. Don't ask me where he'd fit and who would have to move for him though, I'm not the manager, I just type things ... ! Becks is currently back at MLS team LA Galaxy following his six months on loan at AC Milan, a club he obviously fell in love with having seen an interview by him not long back. However if a new deal there can't be arranged, he will be looking for another loan deal when Galaxy's season ends. They quote a 'pal' of his... lol. I've not seen that before...! 'David's had a chat with England boss Fabio Capello and has been told he has to keep on playing at a high level in the run-up to the next World Cup if he wants to be involved in South Africa. So David is certain to go out on loan again once he's completed the MLS season. AC are the favourites. He had such a good time there and was so impressed with the club and the people there.' Vital Villa asked on 13 June 2009, David Beckham for a season? Results were: Ooooh, yes please 87% Don't be so stupid, no way 13% So there you go!
