The pump efficiency information 1100 of the optimization component 970 may comprise one or more such curves 1230 of pump efficiency versus speed, for example, wherein a different curve exists for different flow rates, pressures, viscosity of pumped fluid, motor load, etc. In like fashion, FIG. 14 illustrates a plot of an exemplary motor drive efficiency curve 1400 (e.g., related to the motor drive 960 of system 902), plotted as efficiency 1410 (e.g., output power/input power) versus motor (e.g., pump) speed 1420. The exemplary curve 1400 comprises a best operating point 1430, whereat the motor drive efficiency is optimal at approximately 70% of the rated speed. The motor drive efficiency information 1104 of the optimization component 970 may comprise one or more such curves, for example, wherein a different curve exists for different flow rates, temperatures, torques, pressures, viscosity of pumped fluid, motor load, motor temperature, etc., 224153=[0193] The correlation engine 1110 of the efficiency optimization component 970 correlates the three curves 1200, 1300, and 1400 in order to derive correlated system efficiency information 1112. Referring now to FIG. 15, the correlation engine may correlate the curves 1200, 1300, and 1400 to derive a correlated system efficiency curve 1500 plotted as system efficiency optimization 1510 versus speed 1520. The exemplary curve 1500 comprises a peak optimization point 1530 at approximately 71% of rated speed. This composite performance characteristic curve 1500 may then be employed by the optimization component 970 in order to select the desired operation point for the system 902, which may be provided to the PID 974 via the optimization signal 972., 243387=[0209] In addition, the discharge or outlet pressure is measured by a pressure sensor 2040, which is operatively associated with the outlet 2034 and provides a discharge pressure signal to the control system 2008. It will be noted at this point that although one or more sensors (e.g., suction pressure sensor 2024, discharge pressure sensor 2040, outlet flow sensor 2038, and others) are illustrated in the exemplary system 2002 as being associated with and/or proximate to the pump 2004, that such sensors may be located remote from the pump 2004, and may be associated with other components in a process or system (not shown) in which the pump system 2002 is employed. In this regard, other process sensors 2041 may be connected so as to provide signals to the control system 2008, for example, to indicate upstream or downstream pressures, flows, temperatures, levels, or the like. Alternatively, flow may be approximated rather than measured by utilizing differential pressure information, pump speed, fluid properties, and pump geometry information or a pump model (e.g., CFD model). Alternatively or in combination, inlet and/or discharge pressure values may be estimated according to other sensor signals (e.g., 2041) and pump/process information., 241073=[0207] Alternatively or in combination, setup information, setpoints, and other information may be provided to the control system 2008 by a user 2012 via a host computer 2013 operatively connected to a network 2014, and/or by wireless communications via a transceiver 2015. Such information may be provided via the network 2014 and/or the wireless communications transceiver 2015 from a host computer (e.g., computer 2013) and/or from other controllers (e.g., PLCs, not shown) in a larger process, wherein the setpoint 2010, and/or setup information are provided to the control system 2008, as illustrated and described in greater detail hereinafter. The control system 2008, moreover, may include a modem 2017 allowing communication with other devices and/or users via a global communications network, such as the Internet 2018., 249539=[0214] The diagnostic component may advantageously perform signature analysis of one or more sensor signals from the sensors 2024, 2038, 2040, 2041, 2042, 2044, 2046, 2048, and/or 2054, associated with the pump 2004 and/or the system 2002 generally, in order to diagnose one or more operating conditions associated therewith. Such signature analysis may thus be performed with respect to power, torque, speed, flow, pressure, and other measured parameters in the system 2004 of in a larger process of which the system 2002 is a part. In addition, the signature analysis may comprise frequency analysis employing Fourier transforms, spectral analysis, space vector amplitude and angular fluctuation, neural networks, data fusion techniques, model-based techniques, discrete Fourier transforms (DFT), Gabor transforms, Wigner-Ville distributions, wavelet decomposition, non-linear filtering based statistical techniques, analysis of time series data using non-linear signal processing tools such as Poincare' maps and Lyapunov spectrum techniques, and other mathematical, statistical, and/or analytical techniques. The diagnostic features of the component 2070, moreover, may be implemented in hardware, software, and/or combinations thereof in the controller 2066., 228692=[0197] Another possible configuration is illustrated in FIG. 17, wherein a host computer 1704 is connected to the network 1702. The host 1704 may provide centralized operation of the pumps PUMP1 and PUMPN as well as of the valve VALVE1, for example, by providing setpoint information to the associated controllers MC1, MCN, and VC1. Other information may be exchanged between the computer 1704 and the various controllers MC1, MCN, and VC1 in host-to-peer fashion, such as information relating to process conditions, control information, and performance characteristic information, whereby an efficiency optimization component 1706 in the host computer 1704 may determine desired operating points for one or more of the controllers MC1, MCN, and VC1 according to one or more performance characteristics associated with the system 1700. Alternatively or in combination, one or more of the individual controllers MC1, MCN, and VC1 may determine desired operating points for the associated sub-systems according to performance characteristic information obtained from the host computer 1704, from other controllers via the network 1702, and/or from sensors associated with the individual sub-systems., 227723=[0196] The controllers MC1-MCN and VC1 may exchange information relating to process conditions (e.g., flow, pressure, power, efficiency, temperature . . . ), control information (e.g., setpoints, control outputs, alarm conditions, process limits . . . ), and performance characteristic information (e.g., related to life cycle cost information, efficiency information, life expectancy information, safety information, emissions information, operational cost information, MTBF information, noise information, vibration information, production requirements, delivery schedules, and the like). One or more of the individual controllers MC1, MCN, and VC1 may determine desired operating points for the associated sub-systems according to performance characteristic information obtained from other controllers via the network 1602, and/or from sensors associated with the individual sub-systems., 250951=[0215] Such techniques may be used to predict the future state or health of components in the system 2002 (e.g., and/or those of a larger system of which system 2002 is a part or with which system 2002 is associated). This prognostics will enable the control to be altered to redistribute stress, to control the time to failure, and/or the remaining useful life of one or more such components or elements. It will be appreciated that such techniques may be employed in a larger system, such as the system 300 of FIG. 10, for example, wherein a known or believed good component or sub-system may be overstressed to allow another suspected weakened component to last longer., 219599=[0190] The correlation engine 1110, moreover, may determine correlated system efficiency information according to the current operating conditions of the system 902, such as the process setpoint 910, diagnosed degradation of system components, etc. Thus, for example, the correlated system efficiency information 1112 may include different desired operating points depending on the setpoint 910, and/or according to the current pressures, flow rates, temperatures, vibration, power usage, etc., in the system 902, as determined by the values from one or more of the sensors 924, 938, 940, 941, 942, 944, 946, 948, and/or 954. The controller 966 then provides the control signal 964 as a motor speed signal 964 to the motor drive 960 according to the desired operating point. In addition to efficiency information (e.g., 1100, 1102, 1104) the component performance information may also comprise one or more of life cycle cost information, efficiency information, life expectancy information, safety information, emissions information, operational cost information, MTBF information, noise information, and vibration information. The correlation engine 1110 can also comprise algorithms employing temporal logic. This permits the correlation engine 1110 to establish dynamic, time varying control signals to optimize system operation over a time horizon. For example, if energy costs are to rise during peak daytime periods, the correlation engine may prescribe a slightly higher throughput during off-peak hours (e.g., less energy efficient during off-peak hours) in order to minimize operation during more costly peak energy cost periods., 239182=[0205] Referring now to FIG. 20, another exemplary pump system 2002 is illustrated, in which one or more aspects of the invention may be carried out. The system 2002 includes a pump 2004, a three phase electric motor 2006, and a control system 2008 for operating the system 2002 in accordance with a setpoint 2010. While the exemplary motor 2006 is illustrated and described herein as a polyphase synchronous electric motor, the various aspects of the present invention may be employed in association with single-phase motors as well as with DC and other types of motors. In addition, the pump 2004 may comprise a centrifugal type pump, however, the invention finds application in association with other pump types not illustrated herein, for example, positive displacement pumps., 246864=[0212] The control system 2008 also comprises a motor drive 2060 providing three-phase electric power from an AC power source 2062 to the motor 2006 via the cables 2050 in a controlled fashion (e.g., at a controlled frequency and amplitude) in accordance with a control signal 2064 from a controller 2066. The controller 2066 receives the process variable measurement signals from the atmospheric pressure sensor 2044 (2054 a), the suction pressure sensor 2024, the discharge pressure sensor 2040, the flow sensor 2038, the temperature sensor 2042, the speed sensor 2046, the vibration sensor 2048, the power sensor 2054, and other process sensors 2041, together with the setpoint 2010, and provides the control signal 2064 to the motor drive 2060 in order to operate the pump system 2002 commensurate with the setpoint 2010. In this regard, the controller 2066 may be adapted to control the system 2002 to maintain a desired fluid flow rate, outlet pressure, motor (pump) speed, torque, suction pressure, tank level, or other performance characteristic., 245591=[0211] The control system 2008 further receives process variable measurement signals relating to pump temperature via a temperature sensor 2042, atmospheric pressure via a pressure sensor 2044 located proximate the pump 2004, motor (pump) rotational speed via a speed sensor 2046, and vibration via sensor 2048. The motor 2006 provides rotation of the impeller of the pump 2004 according to three-phase alternating current (AC) electrical power provided from the control system via power cables 2050 and a junction box 2052 on the housing of the motor 2006. The power to the pump 2004 may be determined by measuring the current provided to the motor 2006 and computing pump power based on current, speed, and motor model information. This may be measured and computed by a power sensor 2054 or 2054A, which provides a signal related thereto to the control system 2008. Alternatively or in combination, the motor drive 2060 may provide motor torque information to the controller 2066 where pump input power is calculated according to the torque and possibly speed information and motor model information., 225085=[0194] As illustrated in FIG. 15, where the allowable operating range includes an upper limit 1540, and a lower limit 1550 (e.g., where these limits 1540 and 1550 are scaled from process units, such as flow in GPM into speed), the optimization component 970 may advantageously select the peak optimization point 1530 at approximately 71% of rated speed, in order to optimize the efficiency within the allowable operating range. In another example, where the allowable upper and lower limits 1560 and 1570 are specified, a local optimum 1580 within that range may be selected as the desired operating point. Many other forms of performance information and correlations thereof are possible within the scope of the present invention, beyond those illustrated and described above with respect to FIGS. 12-15. The preceding discussion described sending a motor speed signal (e.g., signal 964) to the motor drive 960. Alternatively or in combination, other drive parameters (e.g., carrier frequency, control mode, gains, and the like) can be changed, enhanced, modified, etc., in accordance with the invention. This can enable even more efficient operation, for example, by changing the efficiency 1500., 234610=[0202] An exemplary method 1900 is illustrated in FIG. 19 for controlling a motorized system in accordance with this aspect of the invention. While the exemplary method 1900 is illustrated and described herein as a series of blocks representative of various events and/or acts, the present invention is not limited by the illustrated ordering of such blocks. For instance, some acts or events may occur in different order and/or concurrently with other acts or events, apart from the ordering illustrated herein, in accordance with the invention. Moreover, not all illustrated blocks, events, or acts, may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with the present invention. In addition, it will be appreciated that the exemplary method 1900, as well as other methods according to the invention, may be implemented in association with the pumps and systems illustrated and described herein, as well as in association with other motorized systems and apparatus not illustrated or described, including but not limited to fans, conveyor systems, compressors, gear boxes, motion control devices, screw pumps, mixers, as well as hydraulic and pneumatic machines driven by motors or turbo generators., 230066=[0198] Referring now to FIG. 18, another process 1500 is illustrated for providing material from first and second tanks TANK1 and TANK2 into a mixing tank TANK3 via pumps PUMP1 and PUMP2 with associated motors, drives and controllers. The material is mixed in TANK3 via a motorized mixer with associated motor M3, drive MD3, and controller MC3. Mixed material is then provided via a motorized pump PUMP3 and control valve VALVE1 to a molding machine 1502 with an associated motor M5, whereafter molded parts exit the machine 1502 via a chute 1504 to a motorized conveyor 1506 controlled by motor M6, which transports the molded parts to a cooler device 1508 having a motorized compressor 1510. The cooled parts are then provided to a second motorized conveyor 1512 whereat a motorized fan facilitates removal of moisture from the parts., 231093=[0199] The various motor and valve controllers MC1-MC9 and VC1 associated with the various sub-systems of the process 1500 are networked together via a network 1520 in order to provide peer-to-peer or other types of communications therebetween. One or more of these controllers MC1-MC9 and VC1 may be adapted to correlate performance characteristic information associated with component devices (e.g., motors, drives, valves) in order to determine desired operating points for one, some, or all of the sub-systems in the process 1500 in accordance with the invention., 248144=[0213] Setup information 2068 may be provided to the controller 2066, which may include operating limits (e.g., min/max speeds, min/max flows, min/max pump power levels, min/max pressures allowed, NPSHR values, and the like), such as are appropriate for a given pump 2004, motor 2006, and piping and process conditions. The controller 2066 comprises a diagnostic component 2070, which is adapted to diagnose one or more operating conditions associated with the pump 2004, the motor 2006, the motor drive 2060, and/or other components of system 2002. In particular the controller 2066 may employ the diagnostic component 2070 to provide the control signal 2064 to the motor drive 2060 according to setpoint 2010 and a diagnostic signal (not shown) from the diagnostic component 2070 according to the diagnosed operating condition in the pump 2004 or system 2002. In this regard, the diagnosed operating condition may comprise motor or pump faults, pump cavitation, or failure and/or degradation in one or more system components. The controller 2066 may further comprise an optimization component 2070 a, operating in similar fashion to the optimization component 70 illustrated and described above., 244777=[0210] In addition, it will be appreciated that while the motor drive 2060 is illustrated in the control system 2008 as separate from the motor 2006 and from the controller 2066, that some or all of these components may be integrated. Thus, for example, an integrated, intelligent motor may be provided with the motor 2006, the motor drive 2060 and the controller 2066. Furthermore, the motor 2006 and the pump 2004 may be integrated into a single unit (e.g., having a common shaft wherein no coupling 2028 is required), with or without integral control system (e.g., control system 2008, comprising the motor drive 2060 and the controller 2066) in accordance with the invention., 231767=[0200] A host computer 1532, moreover, may be provided on the network 1520, which may comprise an optimization component 1532 operative to determine desired operating points (e.g., as well as setpoints, allowable operating ranges about such setpoints, and the like) for one or more of the sub-systems in the process 1500 according to one or more performance characteristics associated with the process 1500, which may be then communicated to the various controllers MC1-MC9 and VC1 in order to optimize performance of the process 1500 in some aspect (e.g., efficiency, cost, life cycle cost, throughput, efficiency, life expectancy, safety, emissions, operational cost, MTBF, noise, vibration, and the like). Thus, in accordance with the present invention, the process 1500 may be operated to both produce molded parts from raw materials, and at the same time to optimize one or more performance metrics, such as cost per part produced. Operation of the system may be controlled such that prognostic information regarding machinery failure, expected delivery of repair parts, and expected energy costs is considered in defining an optimum operating mode. For example, if the molding machine is predicted to fail in one week, then increased work-in-process inventory may be generated while the needed repair parts are automatically ordered and delivery expedited. Alternatively a more optimum control mode may be to operate the molding machine very slow and slow down other process equipment to maintain a lower production rate but a continuous flow of finished products., 221449=[0191]FIGS. 12-14 illustrate examples of component performance characteristic information, which may be correlated (e.g., via the correlation engine 1110) in order to select the desired operating point for the system 902. FIG. 12 illustrates a plot of an exemplary pump efficiency curve 1200 (e.g., related to pump 904), plotted as efficiency 1210 (e.g., output power/input power) versus pump speed 1220. The exemplary curve 1200 comprises a best operating point 1230, whereat the pump efficiency is optimal at approximately 62% of maximum rated pump speed. The pump efficiency information 1100 of the optimization component 970 may comprise one or more such curves, for example, wherein different curves exist for different flow rates, pressures, temperatures, viscosity of pumped fluid, etc. Similarly, FIG. 13 illustrates a plot of an exemplary motor efficiency curve 1300 (e.g., related to motor 906), plotted as efficiency 1310 (e.g., output power/input power) versus motor speed 1320. The exemplary curve 1300 comprises a best operating point 1330, whereat the motor efficiency is optimal at approximately 77% of maximum rated speed., 226411=[0195] Referring now to FIGS. 16-20, the optimization aspects of the invention may be employed across a plurality of controllers operating various actuators (e.g., valves, switches, and the like) and motorized systems (e.g., pumps, mixers, compressors, conveyors, fans, and the like) in a large process or system 1600, for optimization of one or more performance characteristics for unrelated motorized systems. Such sub-systems may comprise individual controllers, such as valve controllers, motor controllers, as well as associated motors and drives. As illustrated in FIG. 16, an integer number N of such individual motor controllers MC1 through MCN may be networked together via a network 1602, allowing peer-to-peer communication therebetween, wherein MC1 controls a motorized pump PUMP1 via a motor M1 and associated motor drive MD1, and MCN controls a motorized pump PUMPN via a motor MN and associated motor drive MDN. Other controllers, such as valve controller VC1 may be connected to the network 1602, and operative to control a valve VALVE1. It is to be appreciated that that the motor controller may be embedded in the motor drive such that MC1 and MD1 are one component., 54127=[0001] This application is a continuation in part application of U.S. Ser. No. 10/214,927, entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DYNAMIC MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION OF MACHINE SELECTION, INTEGRATION AND UTILIZATION, filed on Aug. 7, 2002, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/311, 880, filed Aug. 13, 2001, entitled INTELLIGENT PUMPING SYSTEMS ENABLE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR ASSET MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMIC OPTIMIZATION, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/311, 596, filed Aug. 10, 2001, entitled INTELLIGENT PUMPING SYSTEMS ENABLE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR ASSET MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMIC OPTIMIZATION; of which the entireties of these applications are incorporated herein by reference., 240069=[0206] The control system 2008 operates the pump 2004 via the motor 2006 according to the setpoint 2010 and one or more measured process variables, in order to maintain operation of the system 2002 commensurate with the setpoint 2010 and within the allowable process operating ranges specified in setup information 2068, supplied to the control system 2008 via a user interface 2011. For example, it may be desired to provide a constant fluid flow, wherein the value of the setpoint 2010 is a desired flow rate in gallons per minute (GPM) or other engineering units. The setup information 2068, moreover, may comprise an allowable range of operation about the setpoint 2010 (e.g., expressed in GPM, percentage of process variable span, or other units), wherein the control system 2008 may operate the system 2002 at an operating point within the allowable range., 235881=[0203] Beginning at 1902, the method 1900 comprises obtaining a system setpoint at 1904, and obtaining an allowable operating range at 1906. The setpoint and operating range may be obtained at 1904 and 1906 from a user or a device such as a controller, a host computer, or the like, via a user interface, a network, an Internet connection, and/or via wireless communication. At 1908, component performance information is obtained, which may be related to components in the system and/or components in a larger process of which the controlled system is a part. Component performance information may be obtained from vendor data, from e-commerce web sites, from measured historical data, or from simulation and modeling or any combination of this these. The component performance information is then correlated at 1910 in order to derive correlated system performance information. At 1912, a desired operating point is selected in the allowable operating range, according to the correlated system performance information derived at 1910. The system is then controlled at 1914 according to the desired operating point, whereafter the method 1900 returns to 1908 as described above. Process changes, disturbances, updated prognostic information, revised energy costs, and other information may require periodic evaluation and appropriate control adjustment in order to ensure meeting optimum performance levels as the process changes (e.g., tanks empty, temperature changes, or the like) and optimizing asset utilization., 118669=[0084] Furthermore, if desired, certain aspects of a system or process can be isolated (e.g., firewall) such that prognostics and automated action in connection therewith cannot be taken on such isolated section. For example, certain tasks may be deemed so critical that only a trusted and authenticated human can take action in connection therewith. For example, on a submarine, HVAC and power control may be deemed so critical that at a certain part of control thereof, automated action is turned over to a human. Likewise, such aspects of the subject invention can be employed to mitigate undesired chain reactions (e.g., stock market crash of 1980s wherein computers flooded the market with sell orders, East Coast blackout of 2003 wherein a substantial portion of an integrated power grid crashed as part of a load-shedding chain reaction . . . ). However, it is to be appreciated that prognostics in accordance with the subject invention can facilitate avoidance of entering into a chain reaction type situation by making inference at a granular level and taking remedial action to mitigate a low-level undesired state situation blossoming into a larger, potentially catastrophic situation., 242037=[0208] The pump 2004 comprises an inlet opening 2020 through which fluid is provided to the pump 2004 in the direction of arrow 2022 as well as a suction pressure sensor 2024, which senses the inlet or suction pressure at the inlet 2020 and provides a corresponding suction pressure signal to the control system 2008. Fluid is provided from the inlet 2020 to an impeller housing 2026 including an impeller (not shown), which rotates together with a rotary pump shaft coupled to the motor 2006 via a coupling 2028. The impeller housing 2026 and the motor 2006 are mounted in a fixed relationship with respect to one another via a pump mount 2030, and motor mounts 2032. The impeller with appropriate fin geometry rotates within the housing 2026 so as to create a pressure differential between the inlet 2020 and an outlet 2034 of the pump 2004. This causes fluid from the inlet 2020 to flow out of the pump 2004 via the outlet or discharge tube 2034 in the direction of arrow 2036. The flow rate of fluid through the outlet 2034 is measured by a flow sensor 2038, which provides a flow rate signal to the control system 2008., 218487=[0189] In this regard, the correlation engine 1110 may compute, predict, or derive correlated system efficiency information 1112 from the correlation of one or more of the pump efficiency information 1100 related to the pump 1104, motor efficiency information 1102 related to the motor 906, and motor drive efficiency information 904 related to the motor drive 960. The correlation may be accomplished in the correlation engine 1110 through appropriate mathematical operations, for example, in software executing on a microprocessor within the controller 966. Appropriate weighting factors may be assigned to the relevant information being correlated (e.g., 1100, 1102, and 1104), for instance, whereby the efficiency of the pump 904 may be given more weight than that of the motor drive 960. The invention can also be employed to provide near-optimal operation to enhance robustness (e.g., to reduce sensitivity), in order to provide better overall optimization.}",
