            "There are many clubs for you to choose from so you can find something that fits your taste.",
            "People who are serious about their education will thrive well here. Also, people who want to have parties every weekend will enjoy it.",
            "This is a college where you can party a lot of study a lot. It all depends on what you want to do.",
            "There are a lot of parties on the weekends since it is a college town. Other than that, there are many sports events throughout the year. They also have a very nice gym. On top of that, the resident halls will inform you on various events.",
            "There are multiple dining centers on campus so if you ever get sick of the food at one place, you can go to the other ones.",
            "Everyone is friendly and easy to get along with. However, it is quite expensive so finding off campus housing is a good idea.",
            "Getting used to studying in college takes a little while but you will slowly form groups with a wide range of people. If you buckle down, it is not too hard.",
            "Come prepared for a lot of rain. Look for books online or buy from other students. Look for housing off campus early on.",
            "OSU is a large and versatile campus There are many activities within the school The school is very good with math and engineering programs"

Food options aren't all that great, but food from the dining halls are relatively cheap and taste good. The most expensive options are in the MU (Togo's, Carl's Jr., Panda Express), but you can also find Bueno's Burritos which gives you a massive burrito for really cheap, plus there's hardly ever a long line, even at 12:30 PM on a weekday., 671018=Its winner of the prestigious 2009 Ivy Award.

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck I have only been at OSU for a year but so far its been a lot of money for simple classes. At OSU you have the option of dual enrolling in Linn Benton. I would definitely suggest looking into this, especially in your first year. There is a Beaver Bus that will take you directly to Linn Benton which I believe runs every 30 minutes so transportation is not a major issue. Classes are very expensive and you can get the basics out of the way for a lot cheaper. Am enjoying being here I was very apposed to the idea of moving into the dorms but my parents convinced me anyways and I reluctantly went along with their decision. Living in the dorms my first year actually turned out to be a ton of fun. You have the freedom to go anywhere whenever you'd like as well as be close to classes and new friends. The dorms also have loads of activities for you to participate in.
