(And when I do connect it's just to make the little numbers on the app go away because it bugs me). My pictures aren't up to date, my interests and preferences may have changed and life may or may not even be the same as when I first made this. If you are interested in talking to me, You may take your chances and write me here with hopes that I respond, or you're more than welcome to add me on Facebook: KIMBERLY",
