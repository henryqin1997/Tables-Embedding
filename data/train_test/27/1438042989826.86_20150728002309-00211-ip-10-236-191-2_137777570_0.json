    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{9377=Brodart saw considerable early success with Amlib. By April 2001 Brodart secured 45 sales of Amlib in the United States. In subsequent years, sales were not as strong. In 2004 Brodart exited its involvement with Amlib, allowing its agreement with InfoVision Technology to expire., 10427=In April 2003, InfoVision Technology Limited, with Alistair Robinson named as Managing Director, was formed to distribute and support Amlib in the United Kingdom and Ireland. InfoVision Africa Pty Ltd was established in April as the distributor for Amlib in Africa. Marketing and support for Amlib in Africa has since shifted to Sabinet Online Limited (http://www.sabinet.co.za/?page=library-management-systems)., 16359=Copyright (c) 2010 ALA TechSource, 5119=InfoVision Software filed its complaint in the United States District Court Southern District of California on December 9, 2009, case number 3:09-cv-02714-JMA. In its complaint, InfoVision Software submitted a motion to maintain its current status including a prohibition against OCLC approaching its customers. The court issued a preliminary ruling against this motion, not on the merits but on issues of jurisdiction. In lieu of further proceedings, InfoVision and OCLC were ultimately able to amicably settle their differences, as reflected in the transcripts of an \u201cearly neutral evaluation\u201d hearing held in court on February 1, 2010. InfoVision Software would not continue as an Amlib distributor and would pay only a portion of the license fees due prior to the termination. InfoVision Software goes forward with Evolve Library Management System Given the company\u2019s experience as a software developer and its concern that Amlib would not be developed in a way that would attract new customers, InfoVision elected to create a new library automation product. According to InfoVision Software president Bill Elliot, \u201cthe company saw a good opportunity for a well-engineered, fully configurable product. Many of the other library systems on the market are based on obsolete technology.\u201d, 9932=In May 2000, InfoVision Technology created a partnership establishing Brodart as its exclusive distributor for Amlib in North America. Brodart was a well established provider of furniture, supplies, and other products to libraries. Brodart had its own Automation Division, established in 1974, and created a popular CD-ROM based cataloging product named Precision One and an online catalog called LePac. In 2001 Brodart acquired the automation products of CRS, Inc., including the Media Minder for the management of media center operations., 6487=OCLC folded Amlib into is UK operating division, formed when it acquired Fretwell-Downing in 2005. OCLC (UK) took responsibility for ongoing development and second-tier support for its distributors, including InfoVision Software. More recently OCLC has organized is library automation products into a division called Management Services and Systems. This division includes the entire portfolio of OCLC\u2019s library automation products, including Amlib, SISIS-Sunrise, OLIB, LBS, CBS, and the Web-scale Management System., 8084=In August 2006, InfoVision Software began phasing out their involvement with the InfoVision eDRMS in favor of their own product. The company was especially concerned that the InfoVision eDRMS was not able to pass the requirements for Department of Defense certification. Named RMConsole, this new product was based on the Micro soft .NET technology, which provided a modern platform that could be engineered to deliver features not available in the original InfoVision product. The product has recently been branded the Evolve ERDMS., 8576=InfoVision Software began its involvement with libraries in 2004 following Brodart\u2019s withdrawal from marketing Amlib. InfoVision Software added this product to its portfolio and became the distributor of the Amlib integrated library system in North America. The company inherited the North American customers of Amlib, cultivated by Brodart, and began to market the software to new clients. By the end of 2009 InfoVision Software had about 80 library customers operating Amlib., 3816=InfoVision Software began the development of Evolve LMS in June 2009. Such rapid development was made possible through the company\u2019s earlier work to create a configuration engine for the .NET platform as the basis of its development of earlier projects such as its Evolve Electronic Document and Records Management System. With this configuration engine in place, applications for new vertical industries, such as library automation, could be produced in a matter of months. InfoVision has also created Evolve Planning, a project management product for city and county governments., 7267=In September 2008, the course of Amlib events took a new turn when OCLC acquired the rights to the Amlib Library Management system. Just prior to this transaction, InfoVision Technology separated into two companies: Amlib Pty. Ltd, dealing with the Amlib ILS and InfoXpert Pty. Ltd. which held onto the company\u2019s interests in document, content, and records management. In January 2007, the company had launched its new generation product, called InfoXpert, to succeed the InfoVision eDRMS as its flagship document and records management platform. InfoXpert continues to operate, with Trevor Dykstra as Managing Director and has recently expanded with the launch of its new KnowledgeXpert integrated knowledge management and enterprise search solution., 12770=The Amlib library management was initially created in 1993 for the Canning City Library in Western Australia. The library wanted to move away from their aging mainframe system, called LIBRARY39, developed by ICL (International Computers Limited), and move to a new system with graphical interfaces that used less expensive personal computers rather than an expensive mainframe. The Canning Library developed specifications for a new PC-based system and engaged Roger Armstrong, the programmer that originally developed LIBRARY39. Armstrong formed a company called AMSystems to develop and support the software for the Canning Library and eventually for other libraries in Western Australia., 7536=In January 2007, InfoVision Technology launched its own next-generation content and document management product called InfoXpert, based on Web interfaces and Microsoft .NET architecture to succeed the InfoVision eDRMS., 5920=The transition of ownership between InfoVision Technology and OCLC did not go well from InfoVision Software\u2019s perspective. Dissatisfied with the lack of development of Amlib, InfoVision Software withheld payment of its license fees to OCLC. When OCLC threatened to become involved with its US customers by appointing a new distributor, InfoVision Software filed a lawsuit claiming that ongoing development and second-level support had not been provided and asking the court to prohibit OCLC from contacting its customers. In the absence of substantive development and secondary support, InfoVision Software claimed it was not obligated to pay the license fees to OCLC. In response to nonpayment OCLC terminated the license for InfoVision to distribute Amlib effective December 14, 2009., 11603=In 1995 Roger Armstrong joined forces with Harold Dykstra, who owned a firm called Mitec Computer Systems, to form a new company InfoVision Information Management to market Amlib throughout Australia. The company, then named InfoVision Technology, also offered a records management product called AUSInfo. Both of these products were based on the Microsoft Windows operating system., 9038=InfoVision Software was formed in 2002 by Bruce Elliot to operate as the North American distributor for the records management product of InfoVision Technology, known by that time as the InfoVision eDRMS. Since Brodart had exclusive rights to market Amlib in North America, InfoVision Software was not initially involved in the library market, but focused on the content and document management products for local governments and federal agencies.}",
