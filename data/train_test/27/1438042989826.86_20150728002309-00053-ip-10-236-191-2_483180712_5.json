For mounting such a peripheral monitor, relative position and angle between an antenna and the bumper are gradually changed while being monitored on the basis of amplification degree of an amplifier for amplifying strength of signals received by the antenna, and the antenna is fixed at a position and angle where amount of signal reflected from the bumper cover is the smallest in quantity. (See the Japanese Patent Publication (unexamined) No. 2002-071788 (paragraph 0030 to 0038, FIG. 2) 1, for example).}",

If the driver recognizes at least the presence of any foreign substance sticking onto the bumper cover, the driver can stop the vehicle to remove the foreign substance. Thus the peripheral monitor provides an advantage of improving safety in driving. [0060] When there is any foreign substance such as water drop, water film, mud (foreign substance of a high content of water) or dried-up mud sticking onto the bumper cover, as well as in Embodiment 1, the transmission frequency may be brought to a frequency at which the quantity of radio waves reflected from the bumper cover is minimized, whereby it becomes possible to minimize deterioration in ranging performance due to increase in quantity of radio waves reflected from the bumper cover. It is certainly possible to minimize influence of the object sticking onto the bumper cover by adjusting the frequency, but deterioration in ranging performance becomes considerable due to increase in reflection level and decrease in transmission level in the course of variation from water drop to water film, and from water film to mud. However, it is possible to improve safety by driving the",
