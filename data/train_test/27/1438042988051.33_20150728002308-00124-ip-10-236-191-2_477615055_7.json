Embodiments where one of or both the docking magnet 26 and the valve magnet 28 are continuous or complete, forming a ring, the polarities of the two magnets are always opposite. With such a configuration, any relative rotational alignment between the valve mechanism and the docking port may be provided (i.e., within 360\ufffd) and, as such, must be controlled or selected by the physician. In other embodiments, each of magnets 26 and 28 have a discontinuous or spaced apart configuration, i.e., each is comprised of one or more discrete magnetic segments or a plurality of magnetic segments, the polarities and resulting locking arrangements of which are best described below with respect to the embodiments of FIGS. 2A\u2013C. In either embodiment, when operatively positioned within a native valve annulus, the two magnets 26 and 28 directly contact each other in a head-to-toe or a top-to-bottom arrangement and form a magnetic bond sufficient to provide a fluid-tight seal between the two and sufficient to maintain the seal during normal valve and cardiac motion.}",

In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt to a particular indication, material, and composition of matter, process, process step or steps, while achieving the objectives, spirit and scope of the present invention. All such modifications are intended to be within the scope of the claims appended hereto. It is evident from the above description that the features of the subject prosthetic valve systems and methods overcome many of the disadvantages of prior prosthetic valves and in the area of valve replacement generally including, but not limited to, minimizing or eliminating the need or time for suturing and facilitating minimally invasive approaches to valve replacement. As such, the subject invention represents a significant contribution to the field of cardiac valve replacement. Also provided by the subject invention are kits for use in practicing the subject methods. The kits of the subject invention include at least one subject prosthetic valve device of the present invention. Certain kits may include several subject valve devices having varying sizes. Additionally, the kits may include certain accessories such as an annulus sizer, a valve holder, suturing devices and/or sutures (for",
