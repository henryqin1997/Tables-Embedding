            "Being that we're by downtown Baton Rouge we aren't exactly the best place to be at night. However, LSU has gone to great lengths to ensure student safety and for the most part campus is a great place to hang out with little crime.",
            "It's huge here on campus. They basically dominate everything and have some many events. We also have NUMEROUS houses to join.",
            "We have designated day where we have club fairs that take up all of campus. We have more clubs and activities than I can count! There's something for everyone!",
            "We have a WIDE variety of students on campus. Probably someone outgoing and friendly would do well at this campus. Don't be afraid to express yourself and let you geek flag fly! Fashion forward students also blend in well.",
            "We have MANY unusual traditions here at LSU. Our football tailgate parties are something that cannot be described. You have to come to one to understand the magic! Another thing we have is our beloved clock tower. It's at the center of campus and a symbol of our school. Many couples come here for new years or valentine's night for a kiss. They say you'll be together forever. One more fun, but weird, thing we do is voting to have someone from our football team kiss the pig!",
            "Being from Louisiana is was great to find a college so established close to home. It's a gorgeous campus with many opportunities.",
            "There's always student activities being offered. One popular thing is to meet up for flag football or frisby after class on the parade grounds. Also being so close to downtown you can go check out the night life.",
            "We have two awesome cafeterias on campus as well as numerous popular food chains in the union. No matter what you're craving there will be a place for you to eat!",
            "Dorm life is everything here. You will gain friends quickly and learn insider tips to living on campus.",
            "This college has a demanding work load. You will need to organize your time wisely and stay on top of assignments. The actual work isn't all that hard though.",
            "Make sure to get involved on campus! Make sure to make friends in each class and introduce yourself to the professor. Always stay on top of assignments and study hard!",
            "This college is a lot of fun and offers many programs and clubs. They have a great student outreach program and have many events for students. There are many benefits to being at the college."

There are many many events to help prospective students before college starts & after, including CAS (Center for Academic Success) named 2004 Outstanding Learning Center in the Nation. Freshmen year classes are big but easy (you don't even need books for most of the classes) !!!, 528303=LSU has the best restaurants! We're surrounded by everything you could possibly think of! You name it: delis, Chinese, burgers, fast food, pizza, frozen yogurt, bars, Cajun, Greek, Mexican, smoothie places, sushi, wings, on-campus dining halls... it is all there, and it is all fabulous. I hardly every get tired of eating near campus because of the wide variety of places we have to choose from., 670973=Apply for housing early, and by early, I mean as soon as you're accepted! If you don't apply before December, there is no guarantee of on campus housing., 380691=My freshman year at LSU was many things: overwhelming, exciting, challenging, fun, etc. I cannot wait until I begin my sophomore year this coming August 2012., 10294=LSU has over 375 student organizations, and there is literally something for everyone. One thing that I would definitely recommend is joining a student organization (or two!) It makes the seemingly large campus very small and gives you a close group of peers to count on. The cajun culture is unique, you won't find friendlier people anywhere else. You can go anywhere around campus on a home football game day and be greeted as friends (as long as you're dressed in purple and gold!) LSU is a thriving community filled with culture and diversity, there is no place like it., 564518=As an entering freshman, they base your English placement on your ACT or SAT score. English/ Composite + English/ SAT 18-25/38 min/450-600 placed in engl 1001 26 or higher/ 53 min/610-720 placed in engl 2000 in sophomore year 65 min /730 or higher exempt from English composition, 688716=The recreational center is under construction at the moment but will be completed by 2016. There they have weight lifting rooms they have a rock wall, basketball corts, tennis courts, and more, they are even putting in a lazy river., 185593=LSU's campus is beautiful. The large oak trees are truly magnificent. The LSU lakes are serene and attract joggers from all over the city. LSU is the only university with a live Tiger on campus, whose habitat is an official tourist attraction! And, then there is Tiger Stadium. We call it Death Valley, where opponents dreams come to die! There is no greater tradition that attending a football game on a Saturday Night in Death Valley. Our game day traditions start by tailgating on campus. Then watching the band, cheerleaders, and football players march down victory hill heading into the stadium. But absolutely nothing compares to 95,000 Tiger fans cheering their team on to victory. Nothing compares to hearing your fight song played by the Tiger Band from Tigerland. It gives me chills just thinking about it. Geaux Tigers!, 409164=LSU has tons of clubs & activities for every type of students including departmental clubs, nationality clubs, workshops, Center of Academic Success which was named 2004 Outstanding Learning Center in the Nation !!!, 11158=LSU is facing financial uncertainty, but the academic core of classes and offerings is kept in tact. Student to faculty ratio is about 21:1, which is great considering the 28,000 students that attend the school. Courses challenge students to learn, and opportunities to engage in service learning and communication intense courses allow students to develop real life skills while learning core curriculum. There are plenty of opportunities to stand out and educate yourself for success, should you choose to take advantage of them., 365396=There are tons and tons of organizations on campus and they hold an organization fair in the fall, usually in September so that incoming students can see what's available., 696183=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 633557=Beautiful. Southern. LSU felt like home to me. I will love to be here Fall 2014.}",

Tips for prospective students Get involved, you won't regret it. You'll make so many more friends and probably do yourself some networking for the future in the process. Also I would definitely recommend going to class. Nothing breaks your motivation and focus in schoolwork faster than skipping out on classes. Immerse yourself in LSU and let yourself be filled with pride, and you'll be happier than you could ever imagine at LSU. Bang for the buck I came from Georgia, and through scholarships I attend LSU free of tuition. They are definitely trying to improve competitiveness with other universities across the",
