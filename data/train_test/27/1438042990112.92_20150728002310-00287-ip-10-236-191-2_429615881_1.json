How can you rely on what happened in 2011 as a sign of what will happen in 2012 when the cars are completely different? When Pirelli\u2019s tyres are different? When the circuit can be changed (like the placement of DRS)?, 25640=bt55 said on 9th May 2012, 9:55, 47194=Prisoner Monkeys (@prisoner-monkeys) said on 9th May 2012, 12:16, 108424=Karthikeyan was attempting to predict the outcome of the race through a statistical analysis of previous races in the 2012 season, while thejudge13+ was attempting to predict the outcome based on previous races at the circuit. This is essentailly sabermetrics, if a somewhat generalised version of it., 127969=The only way the results of 2011 could be used to predict the results in 2012 would be if everything today was as it was a year ago. This is what I have been arguing all along, and it surprises me that someone who prides himself on his (supposedly, as you\u2019ll soon seen) superior intellect completely missed this. Your entire argument is based upon the idea that what happened in 2011 will allow us to predict the likelihood of certain outcomes in 2012. But, as I have just demonstrated, changes to the sport in the past twelve months have completely invalidated the historical value of these statistics., 115829=You clearly don\u2019t know how the gambling industry works. The gambling industry does not try to predict the outcome of an event. They offer punters the odds on an outcome happening, and those odds are calculated using statistics, but nowhere does the industry say \u201cthis outcome will happen\u201d. That\u2019s what the punter does, and that\u2019s how the industry makes money. If a bookie gives Sebastian Vettel 2:1 odds of winning the Spanish Grand Prix and Lewis Hamilton 4:1 odds, they are not saying that Vettel will beat Hamilton, only that he is more likely to. The odds don\u2019t eliminate the possibility of Hamilton beating Vettel., 154025=AdrianMorse (@adrianmorse) said on 9th May 2012, 18:39, 140288=bt55 said on 9th May 2012, 13:05, 135815=Nige.B (@nigel2509) said on 9th May 2012, 10:50, 117658=MW (@) said on 9th May 2012, 14:35, 148133=sagar atgamkar (@) said on 9th May 2012, 16:51, 5734=They return to the venue where their season threatened to go off the rails before it even began.

A compatriot of his gets off to a flying start, Rosberg in particular & then lacks the race pace to challenge Vettel out in front whilst the cars held up behind Nico, who have the pace to challenge Vettel, are stuck for the first stint, allowing Vettel to build up a race winning gap & maintain it, ultimately winning the race in dis-satisfaction to the fans., 131181=The comparison of 75% and 80% in Barcelona 2011 was to demonstrate in the same year \u2013 2011 \u2013 the increase from the first 3 races 66%-75% demonstrated that Barcelona had an incremental likelihood of top 4 qualifiers doing better., 137309=Sean (@spaceman1861) said on 9th May 2012, 11:04, 89528=woofie said on 10th May 2012, 18:29, 29932=damonsmedley (@damonsmedley) said on 9th May 2012, 20:08, 146888=Aditya (@) said on 9th May 2012, 15:44, 127498=You refer to the results of the 2011 Spanish Grand Prix, using them to highlight trend in qualifying., 53610=matthewf1 (@) said on 9th May 2012, 20:07, 28385=Calum (@calum) said on 9th May 2012, 12:31, 101397=Prisoner Monkeys (@prisoner-monkeys) said on 9th May 2012, 11:26, 145260=Adam Tate (@adam-tate) said on 9th May 2012, 15:38, 133975=BBT (@bbt) said on 9th May 2012, 20:59, 68759=sonoffingerboy said on 10th May 2012, 18:16, 159774=HoHum (@hohum) said on 10th May 2012, 3:26, 127625=You have, however, completely failed to take into account changes in the sport between 2011 and 2012.

You missed the point trying to be clever using a phrase, \u201csabermetrics\u201d, you clearly didn\u2019t fully understand (lack of knowledge, research\u2026.ie a rudimentary education). You later attempted to backtrack in effect claiming \u201csabermetrics\u201d could be used in a more generalised manner. I suggest \u201cBase Runs\u201d, \u201cOn Base plus slugging\u201d, \u201cFielding independent pitching\u201d\u2026.(I could go on and on) are clearly baseball specific analysis tools. As @fascistmax pointed out to you re: sabermetrics, \u201cThe term is derived from the acronym SABR, which stands for the Society for American Baseball Research\u201d. For a little effort you could have discovered this I also then said that I wouldn\u2019t continue to bore people with more stats. However, if you bothered to do a little research (as a more educated person may \u2013 rather than shooting from the hip) you would know that like for like with other circuits in the same year and under the same rules \u2013 Barcelona has consistently (before Pirelli, before DRS, with and without double diffusers and off blown throttle) rewarded good qualifying significantly more than most other circuits. Hence my comment\u2026\u201dWhat is highly probable is that the pole sitter will do well.\u201d As @maxandjohnfanclub observed of you \u2013 you criticized the original observation by citing statistics and then stated that \u201csabermetrics\u201d (I\u2019ll give you the benefit of the doubt that you really meant statistics) cannot be applied to F1. All evidence of a rudimentary education \u2013 at best \u2013 I\u2019d say., 107714=Prisoner Monkeys (@prisoner-monkeys) said on 9th May 2012, 12:02, 99515=fascistmax said on 9th May 2012, 11:17, 66857=Younger Hamii (@younger-hamii) said on 9th May 2012, 20:20, 96669=Prisoner Monkeys (@prisoner-monkeys) said on 9th May 2012, 11:07, 152537=verstappen (@verstappen) said on 9th May 2012, 18:37, 87732=sonoffingerboy said on 10th May 2012, 18:26, 40874=Prisoner Monkeys (@prisoner-monkeys) said on 9th May 2012, 10:24, 158396=BBT (@bbt) said on 9th May 2012, 21:06, 23814=Read more: 2012 F1 season | 2012 Spanish Grand Prix, 26927=KeeleyObsessed (@keeleyobsessed) said on 9th May 2012, 10:10, 110069=HoHum (@hohum) said on 10th May 2012, 3:17, 73907=sagar atgamkar (@) said on 9th May 2012, 16:46, 37751=JCost (@jcost) said on 10th May 2012, 7:37, 31532=thejudge13+ said on 10th May 2012, 18:08, 39382=matthewf1 (@) said on 9th May 2012, 10:13, 56305=Mallesh Magdum (@malleshmagdum) said on 9th May 2012, 10:15, 138676=Slr (@slr) said on 9th May 2012, 11:27, 92448=Prisoner Monkeys (@prisoner-monkeys) said on 9th May 2012, 10:35, 65135=NERD said on 9th May 2012, 16:40, 79326=Kimi4WC said on 9th May 2012, 14:37, 3591=A very important race for the team as they ready a substantial upgrade package for their F2012.

Then there\u2019s the intra-team battles, the uncertainty over the exact running order and all manner of subplots surrounding tyres and pit mistakes that it feels like there\u2019s been more action and excitment in the four races this year than there was in the entire 2011 season., 151079=Alfred (@afya) said on 9th May 2012, 17:58, 143783=Tom (@newdecade) said on 9th May 2012, 14:43}",
