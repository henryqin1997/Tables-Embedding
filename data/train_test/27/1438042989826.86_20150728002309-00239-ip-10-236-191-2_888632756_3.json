    "textBeforeTable": "2014 Tour Dates Jars of Clay Tickets - Christ Brings Together And one of the greatest reasons why Jars of Clay became so popular and continue to be so popular is their sound -- nothing can beat a wicked fusion of alternative rock, folk, acoustic, and R&ampB that actually works. You'd probably never find any other Christian band out there that brings music together so well. Much Afraid with such hits as 'Crazy Times' and 'Five Candles (You Were There)' earning them the honor of a Grammy. Jars of Clay Tickets - The Scripture Skyrockets And Scripture does to higher limits than the heavens with a 1995 album debut featuring the hit 'Liquid' and 'Flood.' Jars of Clay then later released their second album in 1997, entitled Jars of Clay. Dan Haseltine on vocals followed by Steve Mason, Charlie Lowell, and Justin Gabriel make up the 'Jars of Clay' and to this day probably remember that day when the group first began right at Greenville College in Greenville, Illinois in the early 1990s. Who would've thought, though, that a record label such as Essential Records would sign them as a big act? Jars of Clay Tickets - 2 Corinthians 4:7 When looking at Scripture, you'd find it monumental that a group of young artists can come together and utilize part of a verse as an era of Christian music described as nothing more",
