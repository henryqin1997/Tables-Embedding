FIG. 9 illustrates a further pouch 120, commonly known as the \"Doy-Pak\" type pouch. Such a pouch can be manufactured in accordance with the teachings of expired U.S. Pat. No. 3,502,521 and includes a gusseted bottom structure 123 and a flattened top portion 127. FIG. 10 illustrates a pouch 130 including both a gusseted bottom section 133 and a gusseted top section 137. Such pouch structures have a variety of uses. Any of the foregoing laminate structures are suitable for use in forming a pouch, or the like. One example of a pillow-type pouch 110 is illustrated in FIG. 8. When used to form the pouch 110, the laminate is sealed in a back-to-back manner so that the interior layers of PE are joined to one another about at least a portion of a perimeter portion 115. The present pillow pouch may be used to replace traditional structures typically having a structure of PET/adhesive/Al foil/adhesive/LLDPE, since the new laminates are less costly and are easier to manufacture, yet provide a structurally sound pouch that is substantially impervious to oxygen. A further laminate structure suitable for packaging oxygen sensitive products is illustrated in",
