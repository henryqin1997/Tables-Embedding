Evergreen opted out of the Western Undergraduate Exchange, claiming to be able to give students better financial aid independently. What to do for fun Evergreen has a wide variety of clubs and teams to choose from. The Student Activities Center also makes it easy to start a new club, all you need are four interested people. New clubs are given advice on planning and are able to request a budget. There's a lot of outdoor space and the recreational building is well-stocked. Olympia is an easy bus ride away, if you are looking for city activities. Food and Dining Could be better, could be worse. The baked goods are dangerously tasty and there are a lot of vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options. On the other hand, the food can be disappointing, and the required freshman dining plans are not economical. Dorm Life The Residence Assistants are helpful, and the rooms are pretty decent. Then again, there are usually loud people until around 2-4 am. There is a quiet dorm option. Academic",
