    "textBeforeTable": "Affected Software The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit Microsoft Support Lifecycle. Affected and Non-Affected Software Known Issues.\u00a0None Recommendation.\u00a0Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection under the next section, Vulnerability Information. The security update is rated important for Microsoft Internet Information Services on all supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. For more information, see the subsection, Affected and Non-Affected Software, in this section. This important update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Internet Information Services (IIS). A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that IIS handles input to ASP Web pages. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could then perform actions on the IIS server with the same rights as the Worker Process Identity (WPI). The WPI is configured with Network Service account privileges by default. IIS servers with ASP pages whose application pools are configured with a WPI that uses an account with administrative privileges could be more seriously impacted than IIS servers whose application pool is configured with the default WPI settings.
