    "textBeforeTable": "Other small bead Aviars: \"Hands down the best disc produced. Dependable and a sure grip will lead to many birdies.\" - Matt LaCourte Jr \"The best putter on the market, HANDS DOWN! I carry 3 10time Aviars and a DX. A truly \"go to\" disc for upshots within 225 feet and in. With my loft putting style, this putter helps me get my disc high in the air, but with a great predictable hyzer finish at the end of its flight.\" - Ken Franks About Color and Availability - pictured above are some available Champion colors. This model may not be available in all of these colors. Likewise, each weight range may not be available in all colors. Therefore we ask you to list and prioritize your color preferences and to give us guidance if the color or weight range you want happens to not be available.
