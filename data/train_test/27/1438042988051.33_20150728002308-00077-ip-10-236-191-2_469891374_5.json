Diseases associated with CLN3 include ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal, 3 and neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinoses. Among its related pathways are Lysosome. GO annotations related to this gene include unfolded protein binding. An important paralog of this gene is ENSG00000261832., 57177=This gene encodes a protein that is involved in lysosomal function. Mutations in this, as well as other neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis (CLN) genes, cause neurodegenerative diseases commonly known as Batten disease or collectively known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). Many alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]}",
