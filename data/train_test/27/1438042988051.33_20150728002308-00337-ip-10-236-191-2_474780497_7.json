In addition, a consumer often can only redeem points in an airline-related manner (i.e. to obtain a free ticket or upgrade from coach to first class). This prior art does not recognize the need for a consumer to exchange reward points for non-travel related goods, and in particular renders relatively small numbers of points useless. For example, a consumer that does not travel often may have 500 points in United Airlines, 700 points in USAir, and 1000 points in TWA, each of which is relatively useless in the prior art., 52103=This application is a continuation application of co-pending application Ser. No. 10/608,736, filed Jun. 27, 2003, which is a continuation of Ser. No. 09/602,222, filed Jun. 23, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,594,640, which is based on and claims filing priority of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/140,603, filed on Jun. 23, 1999., 56349=U.S. Pat. No. 5,794,210, ATTENTION BROKERAGE, issued on Aug. 11, 1998 to CyberGold, Inc. The '210 patent describes a system that makes immediate payment to a user for paying attention to an advertisement or other \u201cnegatively priced\u201d information distributed over the Internet. A special icon or other symbol displayed on a computer screen may represent compensation and allow users to choose whether they will view an ad or other negatively priced information and receive associated compensation. The points accumulated can then be used to purchase \u201cpositively priced information\u201d or products., 80947=The trading server may also be contacted in response to a button or hyperlink located on a web page accessible by the user from the airline reward server (FIG. 10, steps 1000 and 1002). The process may continue to that described with respect to FIG. 6 for trading points into a reward exchange account (step 1004). In a similar manner, hyperlinks or calling routines may allow a user to access a reservations system or merchant from the trading server. The link would direct the user to partner or associated air carriers where the points in a user exchange account on the trading server 20 may be used to acquire reduced fare flights., 54467=U.S. Pat. No. 5,774,870, FULLY INTEGRATED, ON-LINE INTERACTIVE FREQUENCY AND AWARD REDEMPTION PROGRAM, issued to Netcentives, Inc. on Jun. 30, 1998. The '870 patent provides a system whereby the user can make purchase of products over the Internet and receive award points, which are stored in an associated database. The user can subsequently view an award catalog to determine which awards he may be able to redeem based on the number of points in his account. This patent does not teach, however, the ability of a user to trade-in his points accumulated in a pre-existing frequent flyer account in order to make purchases of products from the award catalog or allow the points to be pooled with other programs in order to gain further purchasing power., 57501=U.S. Pat. No. 5,025,372, SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ADMINISTRATION OF INCENTIVE AWARD PROGRAM THROUGH USE OF CREDIT, issued on Jun. 18, 1991 to Meridian Enterprises, Inc. The '372 patent describes an incentive award program in which credit is awarded to participants based on the participant meeting a designated level of performance under the system. This patent does not teach the ability to increase the reward points in a user's account by redeeming points from a pre-existing account such as a frequent flyer mileage program.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In addition, the value of the reward points may fluctuate as a function of the company's performance, which may be measured by reference to the price of its stock, revenue, earnings, or some other parameter that is agreed to that reflects the relative performance of the company. In this manner, companies that perform well would provide an additional incentive to a user for using their frequent use program rather than a competitor's program. For example, all other parameters being the same, a user would likely choose the Acme credit card company over the Beta credit card company when the user determines that the Acme company performance results in a 10% increase in the number of points otherwise earned by using its credit card. The value may also fluctuate as a function of the number of points outstanding or the desirability of the issuer to reduce its liability or make it more robust. In another aspect of the invention, an electronic bartering system is implemented, wherein product manufacturers, producers, distributors, etc. can provide surplus or overstocked goods for liquidation into the chain of supply of the system and exchange then for points as described herein. This provides an inventory management and liquidation system for these manufacturers and sellers. The interface would allow a user to login using the frequent flyer account information or preferably, the trading server account login id and password, where the user may use",
