Dominion Midstream Partners, LP operates as a subsidiary of Dominion Resources, Inc. The company, through its general partner interests in Dominion Cove Point LNG, LP (Cove Point), owns and operates the Cove Point LNG Facility and the Cove Point Pipeline. The company manages its daily operations through one segment, Dominion Energy, which consists of LNG import, transportation and storage. Cove Point The company\u2019s operations consist of LNG import and storage services at the Cove Point LNG Facility and the transportation of domestic natural gas and regasified LNG to Mid-Atlantic markets via the Cove Point Pipeline. Cove Point\u2019s Import/Storage/Regasification Facilities The Cove Point LNG Facility includes an offshore pier, LNG storage tanks, regasification facilities and associated equipment required to receive imported LNG from tankers; store LNG in storage tanks; regasify LNG; and deliver regasified LNG to the Cove Point Pipeline. The Cove Point LNG Facility has an operational peak regasification capacity of approximately 1.8 million dekatherms/day (Dths/day) and an aggregate LNG storage capacity of 695,000 cubic meters of LNG, or approximately 14.6 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe), all of which is fully contracted. In addition, the Cove Point LNG Facility has an existing liquefier capable of liquefying approximately 15,000 Dths/day of natural gas. This liquefaction capacity is primarily used to liquefy natural gas received from domestic customers that store LNG in its tanks for use during peak periods of natural gas demand. Cove Point provides services under long-term agreements with the import shippers for an aggregate of 1.0 million Dths/day of firm and off-peak regasification capacity; and long-term agreements for an aggregate 204,000 Dths/day of firm capacity with the storage customers who receive firm peaking services, whereby the storage customers deliver domestic natural gas to the Cove Point LNG Facility to be liquefied and stored during the summer for withdrawal on a limited number of days at peak times during the winter. Cove Point also has an additional 800,000 Dths/day of regasification capacity committed under a separate agreement with Statoil Natural Gas, LLC (Statoil). Cove Point\u2019s Pipeline Facilities The Cove Point Pipeline is a 36-inch diameter bi-directional underground, interstate natural gas pipeline that extends approximately 88 miles from the Cove Point LNG Facility to interconnections with pipelines owned by Transco in Fairfax County, Virginia, and with Columbia Gas Transmission LLC and Dominion Transmission, Inc. (DTI), both in Loudoun County, Virginia. The Loudoun Compressor Station is located at the western end of the Cove Point Pipeline where it interconnects with the pipeline systems of DTI and Columbia Gas Transmission LLC. The Pleasant Valley Compressor Station is located roughly 13 miles to the southeast of the Loudoun Compressor Station, where the Cove Point Pipeline interconnects with Transco\u2019s pipeline system. Cove Point offers open-access transportation services, including firm transportation, off-peak firm transportation and interruptible transportation. Cove Point\u2019s Export/Liquefaction Facilities Cove Point is in the process of constructing the Liquefaction Project, which would consist of one LNG train with a design nameplate outlet capacity of 5.25 million metric tons per annum.
