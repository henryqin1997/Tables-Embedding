The available attribute types for this artifact define what can be configured. Each attribute is self-documenting, because the attribute tip text documents how to use each one. Datastore Preferences (via Global Preferences artifact) OSEE can be configured by setting certain Java system properties when launching Eclipse and by setting various attribute values on the Global Preferences artifact in the datastore. Java system properties are key/value pairs and can be passed as launch arguments in the form of -D<key>=<value> (i.e. -Dosee.authentication.protocol=trustAll). These -D options can be specified directly in the command to launch Eclipse or in the corresponding .ini file for the eclipse executable used. Configuration Properties The Clob attribute data provider is a hybrid provider using both the OSEE relational database and the application server to retrieve and store data. When the data contained by the attribute has less than 4000 characters, the provider uses the relational database. If the data exceeds the 4000 character limit, then the application server is used. The URI attribute data provider is used for large data. The provider communicates to the OSEE application server to store and retrieve data. The default attribute data provider is used for data containing less than 4000 characters in length. Data is stored and retrieved from the OSEE relational database. Most attribute types will",
