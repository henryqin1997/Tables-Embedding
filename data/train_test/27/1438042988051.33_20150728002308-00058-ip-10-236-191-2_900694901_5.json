            "Just relax and take a few deep breaths. JCCC is a great school to start out at to get the general feel of college. It is a great way to be in college, while having the fun of high school. JCCC has helped me so much and i greatful for my time there",

My average per semester with books and tuition has been below $1800 and that's with the max amount of hours that can be taken. By going to JCCC for my first two years, I have saved has been about $20,000 compared to going to a four year university for my first two years for the same classes., 290289=JCCC's tuition for the Spring of 2015 for a Johnson County resident is $1,056. You cannot beat that price, especially with the quality of the school., 15855=1) Enrollment-Decide what classes you want to take before enrollment starts. General Education classes with good teachers and convinient time slots fill up early. So have the class numbers ready at 7:59 AM and call the school and try enrolling online at 8:00 AM. You may be on hold for a long time or your call won't go through but stay persistant. You will get the classes you want, at the time you want, and with who you want if you keep trying. 2) Get involved! Take advantage of the center for student involvement and get involved at the school. Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful. You will make friends. There is nothing to lose! 3) Utilize the resource centers- The math resource center has tutors for free, same with the science resource center and the writing center. All three have tools to help you succeed. 4) Apply for the general scholarship- it is a pain free, 5 minute application. You answer basic questions about race, GPA, income, etc. The school doesn't take extra strides to advertise the application so many students don't know about it. So your chances of receiving a scholarship are increased., 295490=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

This college is also great for working parents or people who are continuing their education and would like a school with a flexible schedule. The campus is not extremely big either so anyone who may have a handicap will also flourish here as well. Basically, this school is geared toward anyone with a will to learn and plan for their future! Tips for prospective students Just make sure that you know what classes you would like to take before you enroll. The general studies classes generally tend to fill up on the first day of enrollment so be an early bird! You can also call and make an",
