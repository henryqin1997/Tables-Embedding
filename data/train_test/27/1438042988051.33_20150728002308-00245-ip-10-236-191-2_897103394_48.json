            "The beach is only minutes away. And if the beach isn't your scene, the Camarillo Outlets are just a few miles down the road. And if you find yourself bored, LA and Santa Barbara are only an hour away.",
            "When it comes to food, theres no shortage here. They have a buffet style dinning hall where they offer dozens of different entrees, salads, soups, and desserts. The choices are endless and the food is pretty darn tasty too.",
            "The room advisors and staff try their hardest to make dorm life as comfortable as possible. They set up so many events for the new dormers to meet and make friends. The dorms are new and they provide you with a fridge and microwave. They also have game rooms and fitness centers for you to use at your leisure.",
            "They offer many intro classes to prepare you for the more advanced classes. If you choose to go straight into the more advanced classes be prepared to dedicate quite a bit of some time to studying and doing homework.",
            "If you dorm, pack light. Be ready to have school spirit, because its all around, dolphin pride is huge. Be ready to put in work, all colleges are rigorous so just expect to have to study a bit. Have fun! The most important thing ever, is to just remember to have fun.",
            "Cal State Channel Islands is one of the most beautiful colleges around. Not only is the campus aesthetically pleasing, the professors are some of the best I've ever met. The entire staff team here are genuinely here to help the students have the best experience possible."
