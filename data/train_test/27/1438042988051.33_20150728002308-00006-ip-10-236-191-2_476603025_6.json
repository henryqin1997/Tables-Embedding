Therefore, the above description should not be construed as limiting, but merely as exemplifications of disclosed embodiments. Those skilled in the art will envision other modifications within the scope and spirit of the claims appended hereto. It is noted that by providing a surgical stapler having a removable anvil assembly, visibility at the surgical site is greatly improved. This is especially important during placement of the purse string suture and cinching of the purse string suture about the anvil center rod. It is envisioned that instrument accessories may be used to assist in performing particular steps of the above described procedures. For example, an anal dialator may be inserted into the anus prior to performing the above-described method steps to provide easier access to the surgical site. An obturator may be used to assist in placement of the dialator. Also, an expandable introducer may be provided to reduce the trauma that results from insertion of the stapling device into the anus. Further, any combination of the components discussed above including the stapling device, anvil assembly, insertion handle, speculum anal dialator, and/or an obturator may be included in a kit to perform a hemorrhoidal treatment procedure. ) can now be actuated in the manner discussed above with respect to",
