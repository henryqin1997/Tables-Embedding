The network 94 may be associated with the Internet. The Internet provides a wide range of multimedia capabilities to the fueling environment relating to remote control and information dissemination. Attention is drawn to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/896,988 for INTERNET CAPABLE BROWSER DISPENSER ARCHITECTURE, filed Jul. 18, 1997, in the name of Russel D. Leatherman et al. The disclosure of this application is incorporated herein by reference., 242660=Once ullage is determined, the control system preferably determines or calculates an estimated cost of fueling the vehicle based on the ullage information. In order to do so, the type of fuel and fuel grade must be determined (block 1750). The dispenser controller may provide a prompt at the display 100 for the customer to select the type of fuel and grade desired for fueling (block 1755). Alternatively, the initial information received from the transponder may provide information on the type and grade of fuel desired for fueling, and the associated control system will determine fuel type and grade accordingly (blocks 1750 and 1755)., 238345=As discussed above, determining the type of transponder is helpful in many situations, such as determining whether a container is authorized for receiving fuel or allowing a personal transponder to leave the immediate fueling position during a fueling operation, while acting to prevent a vehicle-mounted transponder from leaving the fueling position. The dispenser control system 80 or associated control system may also use the transponder identification indicia to access a database correlating the type of transponder with the identification indicia. Distinguishing transponder types is discussed in detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/966,237 filed Nov. 7, 1997, entitled TRANSPONDER DISTINCTION IN A FUELING ENVIRONMENT in the name of Williamn S. Johnson, Jr., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference., 182606=With this dispenser architecture in mind, specific reference is made to the flow chart of FIGS. 18A and 18B. As a customer 12 approaches a fueling station (within vehicle 14), and, in particular, a fueling position at a dispenser 18, either the customer transponder 66 or vehicle transponder 64 is initially interrogated as the interrogator 52 monitors for the presence of a transponder (blocks 900 and 905). Typically, the interrogator 52 in conjunction with the dispenser control system 80 will continuously check to see if a transponder is present (block 910). If a transponder is not present, the dispenser control system 80 will continue to monitor for the transponder (block 905). If a transponder is detected, the dispenser control system 80 will receive indicia from the first transponder corresponding to the particular transponder's identification information (block 915). Preferably, the dispenser 18 will continuously monitor the transponder's location or proximity to a particular fueling position (block 920). Further information is provided relating to vehicle monitoring and positioning in applicants' U.S. Patent Application entitled INTELLIGENT FUELING filed on Dec. 6, 1996, Ser. No. 08/759,733, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference., 213260=The present invention also provides an embodiment adapted to track transponder transactions throughout a number of fueling environments operatively associated with the host network 94. The basic flow of transaction tracking is shown in FIG. 25 wherein a typical fueling operation begins (block 1400) by a transmission from the transponder of transponder identification indicia to the dispenser 18 (block 1410). During the transaction, transaction information is received from the transponder and/or gathered by the dispenser and central control systems (blocks 1420 and 1430). The information received and gathered preferably includes information such as the type of transaction, the dollar amount per transaction, frequency of transactions, and the location of these transactions. The information gathered by the central control system 50 may be relayed to the host network or major oil company network 94 (block 1440). The information is updated and compiled at the host network (block 1450) to enable study of customer activities and transactions. This information is very valuable in advertising and merchandising in the fueling environment. Once the information is compiled at the network 94, the process is ended (block 1460)., 194546=Upon receipt of the transponder ID from the dispenser 18 (through central control system 50), the host network 94 calculates or looks up in a database a main transponder key associated with the transponder using the transponder ID. Preferably, the host network 94 will have initially generated the main keys stored in the transponder and will use the same keys to cryptographically communicate with the transponder. The host network 94 will have cryptography electronics adapted to encrypt the random number using the main transponder key and compare the result to the encrypted random number received from the transponder. If the numbers match, the transponder is a valid transponder, and most likely not a counterfeit. The host network will then use the ID number to look up transaction billing data or other customer related information corresponding to the transponder and authorize the dispenser to carry out the desired and authorized transactions in step four. Additional information is provided in U.S. Pat. application Ser. No. 08/895,417 filed Jul. 16, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,956,259 entitled CRYPTOGRAPHY SECURITY FOR REMOTE DISPENSER TRANSACTIONS in the name of William S. Johnson, Jr., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference., 228772=In addition to suppressing available information, a customer is also provided the ability to change or override a preference previously elected during initial setup (block 1545). Typically, the customer is queried via a prompt on the video display 100 of the dispenser 18 to change or override a certain preference. Upon receiving customer input via the key pad 102, 104, the dispenser control system 80 (possibly in conjunction with the central control system 50) will override and/or change the information provided on the display 100. Changing the preference may include providing a customer with a menu of available information display options. Thus, the dispenser control system 80 will monitor the key pad 102, 104 for a customer response (block 1550). If the customer responds accordingly (block 1555), the preference is modified or changed (block 1560) by simply canceling the preference or selecting a new preference from a displayed menu. The preference may be made temporarily or permanently by updating the database and/or sending an appropriate control signal to the transponder. After the preference is changed, the dispenser will operate to continue the fueling operation (block 1565) until the operation comes to an end (block 1570). If the customer does not elect to change a predefined preference, the dispenser control system 80 will simply continue fueling until the end of the fueling operation (blocks 1565 and 1570). The dispenser may recognize other preferences to precondition the fuel dispenser for the impending fueling operation, including selecting a card type, payment method, account type, or other related transaction information to prepare the dispenser for fueling and carrying out the transaction. The customer may also elect to receive specific types of advertising and merchandising. Based on these elections, system operators may provide additional independent but targeted advertising and merchandising., 234530=Preferably, the dispenser will continue communications with the transponder to ensure that the transponder remains present during the fueling operation and, optionally, the dispenser may monitor movement of the transponder during this fueling operation (blocks 1650 and 1655). If no movement is detected and the transponder is present throughout fueling, the operation will end once the container is full and the customer stops fueling. If the transponder is moved or leaves the presence of the interrogation field, fueling is brought to a halt (block 1660 and 1635). If the transponder is moved and/or the dispenser determines that the transponder is no longer present and the fueling operation is in progress, the controller 80 may act to warn or instruct the customer accordingly in addition to halting the fueling operation. If the container 280 stops moving or is brought back to a proper fueling location, the dispenser 18 may be adapted to continue fueling as part of the same transaction. The proximity or location monitoring features of this aspect of the invention are discussed in greater detail above., 215606=It is well known in the art of fuel dispensers to provide a CRT or other type of screen to deliver instructions, graphics and pictures during the fueling process. Currently these display screens, for the most part, are only used to give the user of the fuel dispenser more aesthetically pleasing instructions during the fueling process. One new feature of the display includes the ability to provide video intercom as disclosed in yak Gilbarco patent application Ser. No. 08/659,304 entitled ENHANCED SERVICE STATION FUNCTIONALITY filed Jun. 6, 1996, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. This display also provides the ability to display video presentations, including advertisements., 108168=The dedicated authorization interface and/or Internet interface may operate on a dedicated service line or a telephone system 242. Furthermore, the central control system 50 may have a direct operator interface 244 associated with the controller 232 to allow an operator to interact with the control system. In more advanced embodiments, a central positioning interface 246 associated with multiple antennas 248 may be used to determine transponder position and location throughout the fueling environment. Those skilled in the art will be aware of a multitude of positioning and locating techniques, such as triangulation, wherein various characteristics of a signal emitted from the transponder are measured and monitored to determine movement as well as precise location. The antennas 248 associated with the central positioning interface 246 may take the place of or act in conjunction with the various antennas throughout the fueling environment to locate and monitor movement of the transponders in the fueling environment. Attention is drawn to application Ser. No. 08/966,237, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,890,520, entitled TRANSPONDER DISTINCTION IN A FUELING ENVIRONMENT filed Nov. 7, 1997, in the name of William S. Johnson, Jr. and application Ser. No. 08/759,733 filed Dec. 6, 1996, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,956,259, entitled INTELLIGENT FUELING in the name of Hartsell, et al. The entire disclosure of these two patent applications is incorporated herein by reference., 216967=With the current wave of data network technology, including the Internet, the ability to deliver information to a customer will continue to evolve. For instance, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/896,988 filed Jul. 18, 1997, entitled INTERNET CAPABLE BROWSER DISPENSER ARCHITECTURE to Leatherman et al., incorporated herein by reference, discusses an interactive fuel dispenser having a plurality of fuel dispensers operating in conjunction with a local server in which each fueling position acts as a client of the local server at the fuel station store. This local server could be connected to any variety of networks to provide information at the fuel dispenser, including the Internet. This invention discusses how the fuel dispensers and station will be connected to data networks to allow information to be delivered to a user, but it does not discuss the problem of how this information will be managed at the fuel dispenser. A user of a fuel dispenser may not have the expertise nor the time to access the information he desires in a reasonable amount of time due to the huge amount of data available today over the data networks and the fast changing availability of different and new types of information and data from data networks or the Internet., 98272=In the preferred embodiment, the communications controller 124, 142 specifically provides a spread-spectrum processor associated with an 8-bit microcontroller. The memory 126, 144 includes 256 bytes of RAM. The receiver 116 operates in conjunction with the spread-spectrum processor and is capable of receiving direct sequence, spread-spectrum signals having a center frequency of 2.44175 GHz. The transmitter 114 is preferably a DPSK modulated back-scatter transmitter transmitting differential phase shift key (DPSK) modulated back scatter at 2.44175 GHz with a 596 KHz sub-carrier. The various interrogators in the fueling environment 10 are adapted to receive and transmit the signals to properly communicate with the transponders. For additional information on a transponder/interrogator system providing for highly secure transactions between a transponder and a host authorization system through a dispenser, attention is drawn to application Ser. No. 08/895,417 filed Jul. 16, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,078,888, entitled CRYPTOGRAPHY SECURITY FOR REMOTE DISPENSER TRANSACTIONS in the name of William S. Johnson, Jr.; application Ser. No. 08/895,282 filed Jul. 16, 1997, entitled MEMORY AND PASSWORD ORGANIZATION FOR REMOTE DISPENSER TRANSACTIONS in the name of William S. Johnson, Jr.; and application Ser. No. 08/895,225 filed Jul. 16, 1997, entitled PROTOCOL FOR REMOTE DISPENSER TRANSACTIONS in the name of William S. Johnson, Jr. The disclosures of these applications are incorporated herein by reference., 246783=Assuming the customer is using a cash acceptor, the dispenser control system 80 will operate in conjunction with the cash acceptor 90 to determine the amount of cash payment (block 1815). If the payment made is less than the estimated cost of fueling (block 1820), then the dispenser control system 80 will allow fueling for the amount of payment (block 1825) until the operation is ended (block 1830). If the customer has placed more cash in the cash acceptor than necessary to completely fuel the vehicle (block 1820), the dispenser control system 80 will act to inform the customer that change will be required, preferably, using the display 100 (block 1835). The dispenser control system 80 will next prompt the customer using the display 100 on how to receive change (block 1840). The customer may be required to receive credit on his or her transponder or go into the station store and obtain change at one of the transaction terminals, just to point out a couple of options. Additionally, the dispenser may provide a customer with the choice to opt out of the transaction (also block 1840). The dispenser control system 80 will determine whether or not to refund the customer's initial payment (block 1845) based on a customer input received at key pad 102 (block 1855). If a refund of the payment is not desired and the customer chooses to receive change by other means, fueling will begin (block 1850) until the process ends (block 1860). If a refund is requested by the customer (blocks 1855 and 1845), the dispenser control system 80 will cause the cash acceptor 92 to eject the customer payment (block 1865) and the process is ended (block 1860). Those skilled in the art should quickly recognize the added benefit in providing customer information before fueling relating to the amount of the potential fuel purchased. especially in light of the difficulties in receiving change associated with cash acceptors., 197664=The dispenser will next determine if the transponder is lost or stolen based on the signals received from the transponder by accessing a local or national database listing transponders which were lost, stolen or used by unauthorized parties (block 1010). After comparing the transponder ID with those listed in the database, the dispenser will decide whether or not the transponder is lost, stolen or being used by an authorized party (block 1015). If the transponder does not appear in the database, the dispenser will proceed with the fueling transaction (block 1020) until the end of the transaction is reached (blocks 1025 and 1030). If the dispenser determines that any use of the transponder is unauthorized from any one of the local or national databases, the dispenser will preferably interrogate the transponder to download any transaction history or information available on the transponder to help track unauthorized uses and determine the identification of the unauthorized user (block 1035). For example, the transponder may be able to track the various locations in which the user attempted to use the transponder. If the user attempted to use any identification means in association with this transponder use, the prior dispensers and control systems may have attempted to transmit this user identification to the transponder for subsequent transaction attempts., 211906=Next, the transponder will download the information in the transponder ledger 270 to the dispenser interrogator 52 and controller 80. The dispenser control system 80 will subsequently relay the transponder ledger information to the central control system 50 if a local ledger 276 is kept or relay the information to the host network 94, if a network ledger 272 is provided. The shadow ledger (local or network) is accessed for the particular transponder using the transponder identification indicia (block 1340) and the transponder and shadow ledgers are compared (block 1350). If the ledgers equate, no update is necessary and the process is ended (block 1360 and 1380). If the ledgers do not equate (block 1360), the shadow ledger is updated (block 1370) and the process is ended (block 1380). Keeping a shadow ledger and updating it as necessary when communications are available with the transponder provides additional security for transponder transactions, indicates transactions occurring outside of the ledger system or associated network, and provides an up-to-date accounting accessible when the transponder is unavailable for communications., 67442=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/060,066, filed Sep. 26, 1997.}",
