If you are between sizes or need assistance selecting the proper size, please contact Customer Service Designer Born in Brazil to Japanese parents, Chie Mihara studied fashion and accessories design in Japan and New York. Mihara cites early frustration with shoes as her catalyst into footwear design: A European size 40, she had difficulty finding stylish shoes that fit. Designing a line of fashionable and comfortable shoes became Mihara's calling. Inspired by fashion history, people-watching, and every expression of taste, Mihara launched her eponymous line of feminine shoes in 2002.
