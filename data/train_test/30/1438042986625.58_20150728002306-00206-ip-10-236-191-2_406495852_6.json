LD50, mouse, oral = 1850 mg/kg. Toxicity Total clearance, parenteral administration = 1.1\u00b10.4 mL/min/kg. Clearance Parenteral administration = 14\u00b15 hours; Oral administration = 2 hours. Half life When a single 2 mg oral dose is give to healthy subjects, 88\u00b14% of the administered dose was recovered in urine and 7\u00b12% was recovered in feces. The percent of administered dose recovered in urine as lorazepam glucuronide was 74\u00b14%. Only 0.3% of the dose was recovered as unchanged lorazepam, and the remainder of the radioactivity represented minor metabolites. Route of elimination Details Lorazepam glucuronide Not Available Lorazepam Product Enzymes Substrate Lorazepam is hepatically metabolized and is extensively conjugated to the 3-0-phenolic glucuronide. This is an inactive metabolite and is eliminated mainly by the kidneys. Metabolism 91\u00b12% bound to plasma proteins when given parenterally. When given orally, it is 85% bound to plasma proteins.
