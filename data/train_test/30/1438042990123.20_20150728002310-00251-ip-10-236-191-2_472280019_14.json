Similarly, process 1350 allows the platform owner to build a syndicated database to which any user can subscribe for a fee., 284720=Once granted database access, the customer or secondary user can generate or download reports of database usage, if the user's privileges so permit, in step 1060. In step 1070 a secondary user, or customer, can download standard reports generated automatically by the IDSP system. Depending on privileges, in step 1050, the customer or secondary user can upload data or procedures into the database, or download data or procedures from the database., 292153=According to a modified operation for adding new appliances, when a new appliance 1250 is added to a network 1220, the management services server 1210 automatically registers the new appliance and assigns management tasks to the appliance. According to one embodiment, installation of a new appliance involves a new communication process 1255 on the new appliance 1250, a revised procedure for the dynamic host control program 1265, and a revised process 1215 for sending software, configuration, and management tasks to the new appliance 1250. The new or modified participants in this operation are enclosed in item 485 in FIG. 12A., 288851=Networks 1220 typically run a dynamic host control program (DHCP) 1265 on a DHCP server 1260 to dynamically configure the network settings of computer systems connected to a network. It is the responsibility of the DHCP to assign network addresses to the devices that comprise a network. When a device is connected to the network 1220, it contacts the DHCP and is assigned a network address, e.g., an IP address. All message traffic directed to that IP address is resolved by checking with the DHCP to determine the location of the physical device having that address., 296345=FIG. 13 is a block diagram of other database services for a platform owner available to the database services provider according to an embodiment. The backend database services 1310 are standard database administrator functions that are performed routinely by the platform owner and are described in more detail later with respect to FIG. 14., 293839=Step 1295 includes sending a message that identifies the management services server from the DHCP to the new appliance. The message may include, for example, the network name of the management services server. According to one embodiment, the DHCP also sends some configuration information for the new appliance, the network name of the directory server, and the network name of the backup server. In some embodiments, the network name is a URL address., 289467=In the system shown in 12A, a database appliance is managed on a network that includes a DHCP server 1260, a directory server 1270, a backup server 1280 and a management services server 1210. In the embodiment depicted, each of these servers executes in a different device on the network. In other embodiments several or all of these servers reside on a single device on the network., 306504=Process 1420 allows the platform owner to perform database administration tasks well known to those in the art. These include load balancing and customer service modifications. Process 1430 allows the platform owner to schedule and devote resources to database backup for all the databases on the IDSP system., 293403=In step 1295, performed by the DHCP 1265, in response to the request from the new appliance, the DHCP sends to the new appliance the IP address assigned to the new appliance and the database name for the database established on the new appliance. These steps constitute automatic discovery of a new database appliance. No human intervention is required for the new appliance to discover its IP address., 305409=Process 1390 allows the platform owner to manage customers, including adding and deleting customers, monitoring usage by customers, and reporting usage to customers., 282942=Once the customer has access to the database, the customer can perform ordinary database functions well known in the art. One of these functions, performed in step 1030, is to define roles for the various users that will be granted access. The roles may include a database developer, database administrator, public user, a member of human resources department, etc. The database administrator then assigns privileges to those roles. The customer with current access must be considered the database administrator in the beginning. In step 1040, a user designated the database administrator can create, modify, and delete secondary users and assigns roles to them with the associated privileges. A user is typically identified by a user ID and may be required to provide a password to gain access to the database., 44483=A system is provided that incorporates numerous features that reduce the total cost of generating and maintaining an Internet presence with database components. The system preferably includes one or more \u201cdatabase appliances\u201d. A database appliance is a machine that includes database software, such as database server software, and non-database software, where the non-database software is specially tailored to the needs of the database software. Such non-database software may include, for example, operating system software from which have been removed services that are typically used in general purpose computers but are not required to support the needs of the database server. According to one embodiment, even the hardware of the machine deviates from a general-purpose computer in order to more efficiently support specific characteristics and requirements of the database server. Database appliances are described in the related application U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/240,229, filed Jan. 29, 1999 entitled \u201cPre-Defined Hardware And Software Bundle Ready For Database Applications,\u201d incorporated by reference earlier in this application., 286011=In step 1110, the customer is given access to enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications or customer relationship management (CRM) applications run outside the IDSP system. In step 1120, payment services, such as those provided by a credit card server, are accessed by passing to them the information they need and storing the information returned in one of the database devices of the IDSP system., 33158=This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/872,932, entitled \u201cTechniques For Automatically Discovering A Database Device On A Network,\u201d filed together herewith, invented by Yuanjiang Ou, Sivakumar Thivakaram, Darryl Presley and Venkat Malla., 295007=Based on the response sent from the DHCP in step 1295, the new appliance sends a registration request to the management services server in step 1297. The registration request sent to the management services server includes data that identifies the new appliance, such as the IP address of the new appliance., 31512=This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application serial No. 60/231,482, filed Sep. 8, 2000 entitled \u201cAutomatic Web Sites With Databases\u201d by Dean Tan, Jean-Louis Baffer, Marc Dangeard, Thierry Gruet, Olaf Ziegler, Peter Renner, John-Brown Evans, Christina DeMello, Niloy Banetjee, John John E. So, Michael Rocha, Yuanjiang Ou, Sivakumar Thivakaram, Darryl Presley, Venkat Malla, Pascal Sero, and Kevin Walsh., 307691=Process 1450 allows the database administrator or platform owner to manage the various versions of software operating on the database devices and IDSP platform., 32051=This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/240,229, filed Jan. 29, 1999 entitled \u201cPre-Defined Hardware And Software Bundle Ready For Database Applications,\u201d hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety., 305221=Process 1370 allows the platform owner to configure connections to database resources as either open Internet connections or virtual private network connections., 295348=In step 1299, in response to the registration request, the management services server registers the new appliance as a managed node and sends to the new appliance software updates, configuration information, and management tasks. According to this embodiment, the management tasks are database procedures that have been stored in the management services server. Also stored are data indicating a particular combination of management tasks associated with each type of database appliance. When a new appliance is automatically discovered and registered, these data indicating the particular combination of tasks, and, in some embodiments, the corresponding procedures are automatically transmitted to the new appliance over the network., 281726=FIG. 10 is a flowchart for accessing a database on a database services provider according to an embodiment of the disclosed techniques. At first, only the customer has access to the databases created by the customer or subscribed to by the customer. In this sense, the customer is the agent of the enterprise that has subscribed to the services available from the IDSP and has provided the payment information. In step 1010, in response to the customer selecting database access, a database login process is launched. In this embodiment, the database login process is initiated by the self-service database provisioning process which presents to the customer in step 1020 a list of the databases to which that customer has access. The customer will have access to the databases that the customer has created as well as databases to which the customer has subscribed, such as a syndicated database created or licensed by the service provider. The customer then selects one of the selectable databases. In this embodiment, the customer requests for database functions related to the database being accessed are handled by the database appliance on which the selected database resides., 296721=Process 1315 allows the platform owner to communicate with the community server for updates and new applications. The IDSP platform handles upgrades automatically as they become available from the vendor. These updates and upgrades are for the IDSP platform itself as well as for any appliances or other database devices attached to the IDSP platform. The upgrades are performed through the community server as with the upgrades of any individual database appliance. The service provider will initiate the process by requesting or approving the upgrades., 286448=Similarly, in step 1130, the self-service database provisioning process sends information over the Internet to a server that provides mobile Internet access, called herein a \u201cPortal-to-go,\u201d and stores information returned from the Portal-to-go in a database of the IDSP system., 290154=The backup server 1280, such as a backup catalog server, provides backup for critical information that is stored in the local network 1220. This information about software installed on the appliances and configuration parameters is used to replace or reboot an appliance that has failed or been disconnected from the network. The management services server 1210 ensures that all management activities required to maintain a database are distributed among the database appliances available on the network., 306847=Process 1440 allows the platform owner to perform database upgrades obtained from the community server. The upgrades communicated from the community server will be phased in by testing them first in the staging area. In the staging area, new versions are installed on appliances for customers to test the impact of the upgrades on their custom applications. The IDSP platform offers a form where each customer can indicate when the upgrade has been validated on their existing system. During this process, customers are able to submit issues to the service provider so that the issues can be resolved. These issues are also submitted through a Web form. Once all the customers have tested the new version and updated their code, as required, the staging area will be updated. Then the production area will be updated., 307878=Processes 1460 and 1470 allow the database administrator to set up security policies and enforce them with respect to the various databases distributed on the IDSP system and with respect to the individual data items in the databases., 298046=Process 1320 is used to monitor appliances and other database devices through the display on the IDSP console (item 334 in FIG. 3A). In this embodiment the monitoring is done using a Java applet that runs on the console. This is an advantage because the same Java applet can be run from a browser, and that allows the platform owner to monitor the appliances over the Internet, or other network, when the platform owner is separated from the IDSP site. Although a Java applet is used in this embodiment, any script or process known in the art can be used for communicating between a remote terminal and the IDSP platform or database devices. The console will have a form-based interface as well as a Web-based interface, so that all operations can be handled remotely. It is expected that the console will be adapted from an enterprise manager appliance pack available for the database appliances., 283787=After the secondary users have been defined with their IDs, passwords, roles and privileges, the secondary users can gain access to at least portions of the database. It is possible for a secondary user to be denied access to the customer's home page 575 and still be given access to a database. One way this is accomplished is by the customer using one of the self-service database provisioning tools to generate a web site to which any user, including a public user, can connect. If the customer has placed a database access component on that Web page, then the public user can log into that Web page in step 1005. Upon successful login in step 1005, the secondary or public user is presented with a list of selectable databases in step 1020. In this manner, a secondary or public user can access a database according to the privileges assigned to the role that secondary user holds., 289905=The directory server 1270 communicates with database appliances using a protocol, such as a lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP), and maintains a repository of database appliance names and addresses on the network., 290699=When a new appliance is added to the network, its address should be added to the directory server, information about its configuration should be added to the backup server, and the installed applications and consumable resources of the appliance should be made available to the management services server 1210. With conventional database appliances, a human operator must recognize when a new appliance 1250 has been connected to the network 1220 and must register that new appliance with the management services server 1210. The registration process includes the database appliance in the list of available appliances and makes available to the management services server the installed applications and consumable resources of the appliance. Then the human operator chooses management tasks that the new appliance should perform. The management tasks include jobs such as backing up the files, clearing out logs, monitoring space usage, creating an index, and synchronizing content with another database, among many others known to those in the art. The management tasks also include events that trigger a response from the new appliance. For example, space usage reaching a threshold amount constitutes an event that triggers an alert being sent to a user of the database device. The management tasks also include patches to the software that was originally installed in the new appliance at the factory., 305926=Process 1410 generates standard reports on the usage of the database. These reports allow the services provider to determine the database resources available for subscription. These reports can be used by the customer to manage operation of customers resources or to determine the marketing success of the customer's web site. The IDSP platform receives logs from Web servers outside the firewall so that data can be integrated into the usage monitoring and reporting. The customer also is able to create special, customized reports of database usage., 300493=Automatic pricing and billing are available through the costing model and associated database, process 1330. Conventional pricing models for service providers are typically quite simple, combining access and certain levels of services packaged together into a flat monthly fee. Process 1330 provides better system and cost tracking that enables the service provider to fine-tune the pricing models. The IDSP provides the necessary level of detail on usage. The pricing models supports syndication. The IDSP platform tracks the costs of licenses in the overall system usage including all appliances connected to the platform. This information and estimate of the operating cost is available to the services provider. This allows the service provider to easily track the costs against the revenues generated. The IDSP platform generates a simple report presenting the costs and revenues per customer and for the overall system., 304609=Process 1360 allows the platform owner to configure any appliance as a dedicated appliance or a plurality of virtual appliances as described earlier. Process 1360 also allows the platform owner to configure a virtual or dedicated appliance as a staging area appliance or a production area appliance. Process 1380, allows the platform owner to participate in the transfer of new and updated applications from the staging area to the production area. Through this process, the platform owner also adds or drops appliances, and changes the management tasks assigned to each., 292876=FIG. 12B is a flowchart of a process for automatic discovery and management of a new database appliance connected to a network according to these modified techniques. In step 1291, the new database appliance is attached to a local network. The new appliance 1250 reads the EP address of the DHCP server from a computer readable medium when the new appliance boots up. In step 1293, as part of process 1255, the new appliance requests information from the DHCP on the DHCP server.}",
