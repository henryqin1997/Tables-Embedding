    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{49468=10/4/12: The San Jose Sharks have seen some defections to Europe during the NHL lockout. Douglas Murray has signed with Djurgarden in Sweden and has appeared in one game so far without registering a point. In the Swiss league, Sharks team captain Joe Thornton has signed with Davos, where he played during the 2004 NHL lockout. So far in five games Thornton has chipped in five points on one goal and four assists. He is playing on a line with New York Rangers star Rick Nash. Logan Couture has signed with Gen?ve-Servette and has appeared in three games with two assists., 69108=1/30/14: The Los Angeles Kings were able to stop the streaking Sharks, who had won their six previous games. San Jose is on fire right now, and is 7-3 in their last 10 games. They are comfortably in second place in the Pacific Division. It may be hard to catch the Anaheim Ducks who have a nine point edge, but they are a full eight points up on third place L.A. Both Joe Thornton and Patrick Marleau re-upped with the team for another three years, which will continue to provide stability for the roster through the 2016-17 season. Incidentally, both scored the day after signing their new deals in a 3-2 overtime win over the Wild., 62146=11/7/13: At 10-1-3 the Sharks look like the cream of the NHL so far in the young season. Their only loss came to Boston who scored a game winning goal with less than one second to play. The wins look good, and that is covering a lot of injuries that the team is dealing with. Team leader Dan has missed seven games since being knocked out of the game against St. Louis. The injuries are taking a toll on the offense as well, which is not putting up the same kind of points as they were in the first part of the season. But the team is in good shape so far and should certainly be in the playoff picture come April., 83545=7/10/14: It certainly should be a new look in San Jose next season as the team continues to overhaul their roster. It is fair to assume that there is a lot of disappointment in San Jose after taking a three games to zero lead on the LA Kings, only to lose the first round series in seven games. It is also safe to say that it was among the biggest collapses in NHL history. Dan Boyle is gone and the team has been non-committal with captain Joe Thornton. They did trade their 2015 third round pick to the Philadelphia Flyers last week. In return, they go restricted free agent Tye McGinn, younger brother of former Shark Jamie McGinn., 86065=8/7/14: The speculation finally came true last week as the NHL announced that the San Jose Sharks would indeed host an outdoor game in the Stadium Series next season. While this is not the January 1st Winter Classic, it is a great opportunity for the Sharks and the NHL. The game will be played in the brand new Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, which is the new home of the San Francisco 49ers. San Jose will face off against the LA Kings at 7pm on Saturday, February 21. Many had hoped the game would have been at AT&T Park, but Levi's holds about 30,000 more people., 100457=3/4/15: Sports journalists, bloggers and especially Internet trolls are known for being extremely harsh on teams, players, coaches, GMs, owners and just about everyone associated with any given team. But they are probably not as harsh as San Jose head coach Todd McClellan is on his team. The Sharks have fallen out of a playoff spot over the past couple of weeks and only have three wins in their last 10 games. McClellan referred to his team as \"fragile\". Well, identifying the problem is the first step. Doing something about it needs to happen now or San Jose may miss the playoffs for the first time since 2003., 67197=1/2/14: Sharks rookie sensation Tomas Hertl underwent knee surgery last week after a hit from L.A. Kings' captain Dustin Brown. Hertl has had a great rookie season so far and looks like he should have a tremendous career once he comes back from the injury. He has been ruled out of playing in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia for his home Czech national team. The Sharks are now hoping that he can return sometime this season for the playoff run. That is in doubt, as there is no word on the severity of the injury or a timeline for his return., 56529=9/4/13: The San Jose Sharks are kind of an enigma in the Western Conference. They always seem to play hard and have a lot of talent, but never can seem to break through to the next level. They were swept in the first round of the playoffs in 2012 by St. Louis, but had a surprisingly strong campaign last season and made it to the second round. Now the expectations are rising, and they will have to rely on more speed and physicality to win. The Western Conference is not getting any easier, but the team still has the talent to make the playoffs and make a run for the Stanley Cup., 57128=9/12/13: The San Jose Sharks dipped into Sweden to land Mirco Mueller in the first round of the 2013 draft. Mueller did not have a great season in his first North American action - posting a 6-25-31 line for the Everett Silvertips in the Western Hockey League. However, he used his 6.3 frame well and displayed the physical play that will one day get him in the NHL. Currently, he is only 184 pounds, so he needs to add some bulk to compliment his height. Expect him to make a few cameo appearances with the Sharks over the next couple years before he gets on the roster full time., 86705=8/14/14: The Sharks and the NHL announced a couple of weeks ago that the team would host an outdoor game in the 2014-15 season as part of the Stadium Series. The game will be on February 21, 2015 at the new Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara. That should be a great venue, but many people wanted the game at AT&T Park in San Francisco, where the Giants play. Levi's Stadium was apparently selected because of a much larger seating capacity. AT&T Park would have the iconic San Francisco vista though. But, new reports indicate that if San Jose gets a second outdoor game at some point, then it will be at AT&T Park., 44367=The San Jose Sharks are a franchise perennially in a position to win the Stanley Cup. With a roster loaded with veteran leaders like Dany Heatley, Patrick Marleau and Joe Thornton, the Sharks are riding high in the NHL's Western Conference. San Jose fans can expect another deep playoff run in 2011., 58362=9/26/13: The NHL is staging six, count 'em, six outdoor hockey games this season. There is the traditional Winter Classic. There is also the most unique game which will feature the L.A. Kings hosting the Anaheim Ducks at Dodger Stadium. Reports out of the Bay Area indicate that San Jose could be in line for an outdoor game in the 2014-15 season. It would not be the Winter Classic, but could be a stadium game, perhaps at the home of the Giants or 49ers. A lot of this may come down to how viable the warm weather game is, so all eyes will be on Dodger Stadium to see how the ice and the players hold up in the relative heat., 79785=5/29/14: We are not going to delve into the historic disaster that was the 2014 playoffs for the San Jose Sharks. That has been well documented and seems like piling on at this point. While the team may still be smarting from their elimination, they still have a very strong core group of players. Reports now indicate that they will not be major players in free agency this season and prefer to go forward with their young players. In good news for the fans, the team announced that they will not raise ticket prices next season, so at least they have that going for them., 45365=San Jose Sharks tickets allow fans the opportunity to see one of the NHL's newest franchises begin to write its own history. Established in 1991, the Sharks joined the National Hockey League as an expansion team and play their games at the HP Pavilion at San Jose. Watch as the Sharks build their legacy and work to bring a Stanley Cup to San Jose!, 92409=10/29/14: The Sharks started out with a very strong 4-0-1 record. But then they did what they have been known to do in the past, which is go on a prolonged losing streak. That hit a new low last Saturday when San Jose was bested by lowly Buffalo 2-1. It was only Buffalo's second win of the season. Despite it being their fourth loss in a row, at leas Marc-Edouard Vlasic says that \"there's nothing wrong with the Sharks\". San Jose is in the middle of a long road trip right now, one that may have them under .500 when they return home to host the New York Islanders on Saturday, November 1st., 101131=3/11/15: The San Jose Sharks have enjoyed (or rather, endured) a roller coaster season in 2014-15. They seem to trade off between long losing streaks and long winning streaks. With just 15 games left in the season, they better hope they get on one of those winning streaks soon so they can make the playoffs. They are four points and two teams away from a wild card birth. San Jose just has not been able to specialize in any key area this season. They have scored just about as much as they have given up and are much better on the road than at home. They have a tough weekend ahead of them too, as they host Nashville on Thursday and Chicago on Saturday., 94719=12/3/14: It is a tough time to be a Sharks fan. San Jose has been one of the better franchises in the NHL for quite a while and has not missed the playoffs since 2003. But they are a disappointing 11-10-4 this season and, as owner Haso Plattner wrote, \"have to fight to reach the top eight in our conference\" to make the playoffs again. At least San Jose snapped a four game winless streak last week, and did so against Anaheim. Now they just need to build on that win and return to their customary spot near the top of the standings., 79194=5/22/14: The San Jose Sharks may want head coach Todd McClellan back next season - though he may be the apple of the Toronto Maple Leafs' eye. At the same time, they look to go forward without the services of defenseman Dan Boyle and forward Martin Havlet. Sharks' GM Doug Wilson stated on a call with the media that those two are not expected to return. Boyle is a free agent, so that is easy enough. Havlet, however, has another year at $5 million on his contract. That means they will have to trade or cut him. Either way, there is a very good chance that the Sharks will be paying some or all of his contract in the 2014-15 season., 76143=4/17/14: Right on cue, the Sharks got better before the playoffs - both literally and figuratively. The team welcomed back rookie forward Tomas Hertl last Friday, just in time to host the red-hot Colorado Avalanche. Hertl has missed the past 45 games after a collision (on December 19th) with L.A. Kings captain Dustin Brown resulted in a torn PCL and MCL in his right knee. Hertl had surgery and rehab to repair the damage, and is now medically cleared to play. The Sharks could use his talents, as they are likely to play the Kings in the first round of the playoffs next week., 54152=8/8/13: The San Jose Sharks may be well represented in the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi Russia. So far, six players on the roster have been invited to their country's training camps. This does not mean they will make their respective teams, but does show the kind of talent San Jose has stockpiled on their roster. For the U.S., Joe Pavelski is the invitee, and Finland is calling upon goaltender Antti Niemi. Canada, though has invited four: team captain Joe Thornton, Dan Boyle, Logan Couture, and Marc-Eduoard Vlasic. Interestingly, Patrick Marleau was left off the roster., 43243=NHL Playoffs - Pacific Division Two of the last seven Stanley Cup titles have landed on the West Coast, with a third narrowly escaping the Pacific Division's grasp when the Bruins beat the Canucks in the thrilling seven-game series of 2011. While only three seeds from the revamped Pacific managed to qualify for the NHL\u2026, 90424=10/8/14: The San Jose Sharks, as an organization, are ready to move on from last season's heartbreaking first round elimination to the L.A. Kings after being up three games to none. Sharks' forward Logan Couture is reportedly ready to move on as well. He had a frustrating season aside from the playoff loss. He suffered a hand injury last January and was left off of the Canadian Olympic team that won the gold medal. If what head coach Todd McClellan says is true, then he is not carrying \"any baggage\" going into the new season. San Jose opens up at L.A. on Wednesday, which just seems cruel., 91788=10/22/14: The San Jose Sharks are off to a fast start this season. That should not be a surprise to an knowledgeable hockey fan, though. Despite reorganizing the team a bit and shipping off a few stalwarts, the team is loaded with talent. Additionally, they have to be motivated by the embarrassing first round playoff elimination to the L.A. Kings after going up three games to none. This invites comparisons to the 2011 Boston Bruins who were in a similar position (the Bruins were up 3-0 on Philadelphia in the previous playoffs and lost the series). All Boston did was go on to win the Stanley Cup that season. It is too early to make that comparison, but the Sharks would like for history to repeat., 84782=7/24/14: The San Jose Sharks are determined to enter the 2014-15 season with a new culture and attitude. The team has already gotten rid of defenseman Dan Boyle and right winger Martin Havlat while brining in bruising left winger John Scott and defenseman Taylor Fedun. General Manager Doug Wilson wants more productivity and leadership out of younger players like Joe Pavelski, Logan Couture and Marc-Edouard Vlasic. That may mean a diminished role for veterans like Joe Thornton and Patrick Marleau. It looks like Wilson is fairly content with the roster, but wants a more edgy attitude in the locker room and on the ice.}",
