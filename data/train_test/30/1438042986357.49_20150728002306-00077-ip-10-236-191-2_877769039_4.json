It was followed by the release of the second single titled \"Wait for Me,\" on August 6. Then, during the Heineken Open'er Festival 2013, Kings of Leon performed \"Don't Matter,\" another new track from the album. That trio definitely gave fans a sneak peek of the music to come long before they ever took a ride on the \"Mechanical Bull.\", 4916=Kings of Leon also recently performed on NBC stalwart \"Saturday Night Live,\" and kick off their 2014 tour in February.
