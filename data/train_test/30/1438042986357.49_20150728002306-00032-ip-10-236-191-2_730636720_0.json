The cost-of-living increase is required to be published in the Federal Register on or before November 14 of the year preceding the year the benefits are payable. The amount of the special minimum PIA is computed by multiplying the number of years of coverage, in excess of 10 and up to 30, by $9.00 for benefits payable for years before 1979.

A \u201cspecial minimum PIA\u201d is payable to some persons who have had covered employment or self-employment for many years at low earnings.

Years of covered work are determined by the following: We add up your total wages credited to you for the years after 1936 and before 1951. We divide the sum in (A) by $900. We do not count any fraction (do not round up or down). This number must not be higher than 14. We count the number of years after 1950 which are: (1) \u201cbase years\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7703 through 705; and (2) years in 1951-1978 in which you have credit for wages and self-employment income of at least 25 percent of the maximum amount.
