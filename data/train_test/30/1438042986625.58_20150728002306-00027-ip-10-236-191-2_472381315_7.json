U.S.A. 1986, 83, 8333! exhibits remarkable activities against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Viral inhibition resulting from AZT appears to require a selective phosphorylation of the compound to give the corresponding monophosphate by thymidine kinase. Then host cell kinases convert the monophosphate to triphosphate. The triphosphate anabolite of AZT is an alternate substrate for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, which terminates DNA synthesis after incorporation into the growing DNA strand Reardon, J. E. Biochemistry 1992, 31, 4473; Reardon, J. E. et al. J Biol. Chem. 1990, 265, 20302!. However, the triphosphate intermediate of AZT also affects the activities of the host cell enzymes other than the host cell kinases, which results in the formation of toxic vice-products. For example, the triphosphate intermediate of AZT is recognized as an alternate substrate by DNA polymerase for syntheses of DNA. Therefore, AZT has a shortcoming in term of its high cellular toxicity., 53201=To a solution of compound 45 (0.67 g, 1.0 mmol) in THF (6.0 mL) was added n-Bu4 NF (1.0M solution in THF, 0.62 g, 2.4 mmol).
