            "If you're looking for a big party school where you can get the full college experience, then Biola is not the school for you. However, partying is not the only way to have fun in college. Biola is located down in southern California near LA! Disneyland is only ten minutes away from Biola, Korea town isn't too far off either. Korean BBQ!",
            "The food is good but not the best. Biola does make the effort to provide the healthiest choices for the students but sometimes it can be a bit repetitive and after a while you tend to get sick of it.",
            "Dorm life is great! The campus isn't so big that it makes it super inconvenient for students to go back and forth from their dorms to classes. Each floor has its own theme and has great RA's who do their best to unite and bring together everyone on each floor as brothers and sisters of Christ.",
            "In terms of admissions, Biola is not too rough. But does that make it an easy school in general? No it does not. This is college, guys. You've got to work hard whether the school is highly renowned or not. The academics in Biola without a doubt builds up and elevates the spiritual and intellectual proficiency of most students.",
            "Choose Biola. If you're like me, then you're probably trying to decide on a list of different Christian private universities. Azusa Pacific is not a bad choice. But Biola not only provides a combination of biblical and academic education, it also has the best community. Come visit the campus and you'll be surprised. It's smaller than most UC campuses, but it is absolutely vibrant and full of energy.",
            "Biola University is an amazing school that keeps the students in tune and on track with excellent academics and top-notch biblical studies. I absolutely love the campus and the community because it not only consists of students committed to following Christ, but there is something about the school that makes it entirely vibrant and full of the grace of God. Going to Biola University was the best decision I have ever made."

Not great for those who are being made to attend school and would rather party. Tips for prospective students Biola has said that they'll never turn away a student who fits the basic qualifications (one is that the student be a Christian) and genuinely wants to go. So apply! Bang for the buck Biola is very expensive. However, the quality of education is good and the community is wonderful. Get scholarships, get financial aid, but don't be afraid to go. Am enjoying being here I get homesick being three thousand miles from home, but not as much as you might think. The other students are almost universally friendly and willing to",
