            "Great food, options get better each year. The plans can be expensive, but that is why scholarships are so helpful!",
            "There are always events and new people to meet. You have everything you need in the dorms, and they are all close to each other and to the academic buildings.",
            "Classes are not easy, and there is never really a day where you can skip studying, but there is also never really a day where you can't do something fun. The great thing is, all your friends will be studying too, so you can work on good habits together!",
            "Do not get into the habit of procrastinating, if you are already in that habit, get out of it soon! Talk to your professors, talk to other people in your major for any questions. Keep in touch with family and friends from back home. Don't let good opportunities pass you by, even if they take a little work. Apply for scholarships! Manage your money.",
            "This University is engaging, full of things to do, and a place almost everyone knows each other. Whatever you are interested in, there is a place for you here, from Medieval Society, to student government, to the international student club, there is so much to do! Also, what most people enjoy the most here is being able to have one on one encounters with our professors!"

This fountain adds a peaceful atmosphere to the campus. Around this fountain are two concrete walls that explain the meaning behind this beautiful fountain., 150338=The University of Evansville just currently announced the Big Freeze. Starting next year, 2013, incoming freshmen's tuition will be frozen. What that means is, whatever tuition the students have currently will remain the same for the next four years of their college. So it is great for parents and students because they can save money for themselves., 168225=Sticker price is expensive (~$40K/year) but scholarships are generous and the Big Freeze (no changes in tuition for current and incoming 2013 freshmen) are a big help. Work-study as well as a few other on campus jobs are available., 253288=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 89862=Everyone here is obsessed with the Basketball team and Soccer team. There are many clubs to chose from, but be warned with a school of a little more than 2000, don't expect to have huge group activities., 147248=The University of Evansville is an amazing campus where students can feel very much at home. It is very personal and students have the chance to really connect with their peers and professors since the student-teacher ratio is 13:1, and every faculty member makes it a personal effort to make sure that every students succeeds.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students I would say everyone, really. Although, if you're looking to party your way through school, be forewarned that it's a dry campus! Also, there is a Greek pressence on campus. The fraternities are all right around the corner (literally). However, the sororities don't have any house; has to do with an old Indiana law that never got thrown out. But although there is a Greek pressence, it's certainly not the only thing on campus either. There's also a really strong international pressence, and some really great organizations to go along with that: International Student Club, I-House, and I-Pals. Honestly, there truly is something for everyone here. Tips for prospective students Go for a campus visit--during the school year. You need to be on the campus to truly get a feel for what life is like there. And don't be afraid to contact the admissions office if you have questions, either. They're always really helpful and really friendly. Bang for the buck Although UE is a wonderful place to be, it is expensive. $34,000 a year is a lot of money. Especially since it doesn't always seem like that money is going places that I would like it to. However, they are really great about trying to get you the greatest amount of aid as possible,",
