    "textAfterTable": "Food and Dining Specialty Mac and Cheese nights are the nights when the cafe is absolutely packed! Those and the kids bar nights are the most popular by far on campus. They'll change things up and have specialty meals like steaks, stuffed mushrooms, and sushi, too. The Cat's Pause (more commonly referred to as the CP) is a great place for hot off the grill foods. Dorm Life The walls are paper thin. So if your neighbors get in at two in the morning from the bar, you might just get woken up unless you sleep like the dead. The two person rooms are tiny and pretty claustrophobic if they're not arranged a certain way. The school does an alright job of pairing you with a decent roommate, but they do fail every once in a while and give you the roommate from hell. Academic Rigor I'm sure it's the same with most schools, but there are easy teachers and there are teachers who have classes that it's nearly impossible to get an 'A' in. As long as you apply yourself to the best of your ability and keep a good open communication with you professors, you should be just fine. Tips for prospective students",
