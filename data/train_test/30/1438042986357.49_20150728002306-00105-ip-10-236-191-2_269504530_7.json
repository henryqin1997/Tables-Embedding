It is actually a project, or a movement which goal is spreading love for boobs. Volim Grudi isn't male exclusive and accepts both male and female players as its members. Since VG isn't a party in real sense it doesn't participate in Serbia's political life seriously. It doesn't support other parties on elections for Congress or country presidency. When Volim Grudi manages to participate in any of the elections it supports only its own candidates.
