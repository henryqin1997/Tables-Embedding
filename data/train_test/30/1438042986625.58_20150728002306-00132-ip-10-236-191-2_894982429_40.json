            "Canisius Public Safety does a good job of patrolling. The area is not the best, so it's good to walk in numbers at night and always be aware of surrounding.",
            "Minimal. There is one social business fraternity, which accepts females as well, and one sorority. They aren't very prevalent on campus.",
            "I played on the softball team and it was great getting to be so close to my teammates. There are also a lot of clubs on campus based on interest, major, or sports.",
            "Students who like smaller classrooms and getting individual attention from teachers. You will never be just a number.",
            "Battle of the Bridge - a HUGE rivalry between Canisius and Niagara. Each year they tally up points from each sporting event between the schools and whoever wins the most, wins the Canal Cup.",
            "Its pricey, but if you are staying in the New York area, it has a good reputation especially in accounting/finance.",
            "Buffalo is full of fun things to do! There is a ton of night-life, several sports teams, and a fun park nearby great for sports and running. Buffalo residents are big on their sports team so keep up with the Sabres and the Bills.",
            "The food sucks and generally causes and upset stomach.",
            "The dorms are great. As a freshman, Dugan is the newest and biggest. Upperclassmen move down the street to Village Townhouses, which are apartment style and each person gets their own room, though it is small.",
            "Canisius was challenging academically, but I was able to play softball for their NCAA Division I team and earn a dual degree in management and marketing.",
            "Make sure that you are comfortable living in the middle of the city. It is a great school, but the area isn't for everyone.",
            "Canisius is a Jesuit school with small class sizes. It was great being able to know my professors personally and have one-on-one time. The athletic department was also great and very supportive of it's student-athletes."

The earlier your application is in and you make your deposit, the more housing options you have. If you qualify for honors or are interested in service, you can live on the honors or Ignatian floors. These two floors are in the freshman hall that was built in 2008. They are modern and very spacious. Another benefit is that they are air-conditioned. Another tip is if you have taken college classes in high school, send them to the college to see if they transfer. The more core requirements you can get out of the way, the faster you can start working on the classes that really count towards your major.}",

You can cruise through with ease if you are motivated to learn and complete course work and home work.
