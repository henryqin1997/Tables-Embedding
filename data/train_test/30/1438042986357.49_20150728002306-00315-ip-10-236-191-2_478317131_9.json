    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The second leg of the graft system is identical to the first leg except with respect to the aortic stent and is deployed in a similar manner once the aortic stents are properly aligned with one another in a manner similar to that described with respect to the other embodiments. After deployment of upper graft segment 566, the entire delivery system is advanced cranially until the iliac stent 522 is in proper position relative to the internal iliac artery, as shown in FIG. 17. Injection of radiographic contrast solution aids in positioning the iliac stent. After positioning of iliac stent 522, main sheath 620 is further withdrawn, allowing the lower graft segment to deploy within the upper segment as shown in FIG. 18. FIG. 19 shows leg 570 fully deployed and main sheath 620 being removed through the external iliac artery. Main sheath 620 is further withdrawn in FIG. 16, showing the upper graft segment 566 deployed. Since main sheath 620 covers support stents 526 its retraction causes them to expand. A plurality of support stents 526 are pre-loaded in the delivery catheter. Each is pre-attached to either the upper or lower graft segment depending on its location. In between the support stents there may be support stent buttresses to maintain the correct position of the support stents during deployment. The end of main sheath 620 is atop secondary bulb 660 which provides a smooth transition",
