Each diamond point represents the number of days needed for completion of a formal consultation for a specific project. Formal consultation is entered into when a project is determined \"likely to adversely affect\" a listed endangered species (some of the most encountered on projects are chinook, coho, sockeye, and chum salmon; bull trout; bald eagles, and marbled murrelets). Formal consultations are required to be completed with 135 days (90 days for consultation and 45 days to prepare a biological opinion (BO))., 20937=This table reflects the number of authorizations / modifications approved within certain timeframes since 1999. For federal fiscal year (FY) 2008 our approval has increased to 91% (1645/1803) up from FY 2007's 86% (1451/1697) within the first five (5) days. The 91% exceeded our goal of 90%!

Our goal is to ap-prove 90% of these reports within 10 days of receipt. We did not meet our goal in the 3rd/4th quarters of FY 2008. This is attributed to the Washington Division revising its long-standing policy to not pay for \"debris removal.\" After evaluating the Division's policy against new ER guidance from HQ we modified our policy to cover costs associated with debris removal within the roadway prism. Many debris removal ER damage inspection reports were held for several weeks while the Division's policy was being reevaluated resulting in the longer than usual time for approval., 160=U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE Washington, DC 20590 202-366-4000}",
