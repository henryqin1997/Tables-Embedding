It was really a shame. E.J. VISO (No. 59 PDVSA-KV Racing Technology-Lotus):It was a really heartbreaking race.\u00a0 It looked pretty clear that we could have finished 5th in the worst case scenario if the race had continued the way it was going, but a \"lottery\" came up at the end where we stuck with the leaders strategy and it worked out only for (Will) Power.\u00a0 We had a pretty good car that gave me the speed necessary to stay with the lead pack.\u00a0 It's one of those races where things were going great and then we lost it all.\u00a0",
