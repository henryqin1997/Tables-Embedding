Departs: 22 August 2015 (Land only: 23 August 2015)., 164217=As mentioned before, many of the major sites and cities are packed, be prepared! We were there in August and it was both wet and hot. Buy or take a brolly for both the sun and rain. The trip notes say bring boots for the great wall, I am sure this is just Exodus being cautious. Trainers or even good sandals are adequate, be prepared to see some of the Chinese tourists up there in their high heels, we spotted several! We found the food great in mainland China, tasty, clean and interesting. Even our picky 14yr old got stuck into most things, including the donkey and frog! There is always much said about the toilets and yes some of them can be unsavoury and you need to take tissue, but hey, \u201cwhen in Rome\u2026.\u201d Be prepared to be looked at and, especially if your kids have blond hair, photographed. It is not intrusive and the people are very polite, it is even fun. It was a surprise to be asked by trendily dressed Chinese if they can take a photo, they may not have seen any westerners in the flesh, but they usually pull out the latest Iphone or top of the range Canon SLR to take the pic with, again astonishing!, 38102=This unique cycling raid is a must-do route for any road cycling fan. It will take us on a journey over eleven of the most famous Cols in the Pyrenees. Departs: 15th August 2015, 18061=Stunning Croatian islands and the historic cities of Split, Trogir and Dubrovnik. Departs: 27 September 2015., 157099=Don t worry too much about the weather if travelling in August. We did not find it too hot and we only had rain on one morning. All of the hotels were of a good standard with western loos. I used my umbrella as a sunshade most days. Mosquitos increased as we went further south but again non of our party were badly affected. We ate all types of food from hotels/ restaurants / markets / street food and non of our group were ill at all.}",
