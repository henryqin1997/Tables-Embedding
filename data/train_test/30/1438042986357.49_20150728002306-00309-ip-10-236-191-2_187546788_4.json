    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{559363=Anon. 1535, 352026=The melody, \u201cChriste, du Lamm Gottes,\u201d is among those which the reformed Church took over from its predecessor. The hymn is a translation of the \u201cAgnus Dei.\u201d With the melody it appears in a text of 1557. Bach uses it in the Orgelbuchlein; Cantatas 23, 127 (1724-c. 1740); and in the \u201cKyrie\u201d of the Mass in F. His text follows Witt (No. 103)., 229183=The reference to Bach\u2019s sons establishes the date of the publication as in or after 1746. The \u201cson in Halle\u201d was Bach\u2019s eldest, Wilhelm Friedemann, who was appointed Organist there in 1746. The \u201cson in Berlin\u201d was Carl Philipp Emmanuel, who had been appointed Clavier accompanist to Frederick the Great of Prussia in 1740., 383081=Johannes Steurlein 1588, 801062=Luther published his Christmas hymn, \u201cVom Himmel hoch da komm ich her,\u201d in Schumann\u2019s Hymn-book (1539) with a tune which is generally attributed to himself. Bach uses it in the Christmas Oratorio (1734), Nos. 9, 17, 23, and in the Organ movements infra. His text is invariable and conforms to the original except in one detail: for the fifth note of the last phrase he takes the melody up Edition: current; Page: [307] to D (supra). The emendation dates from 1629 and is found in Witt\u2019s text (No. 21)., 138151=The hymn is attributed to Melchior Franck. It is in ten stanzas, addressed to the Feet (st. ii), Knees (st. iii), Hands (st. iv, v), Side (st. vi), Breast (st. vii), Heart (st. viii), and Face (st. ix) of Jesus. Witt sets it to the tune \u201cWie sch\u00f6n leuchtet der Morgenstern.\u201d As Bach introduces that melody in No. 120 infra, it is probable that he intended to use the proper melody of Franck\u2019s (?) hymn here. It was published, with the hymn, in 1627 and is by Franck himself (Zahn, No. 8360). Both hymn and melody are found in the Gotha Cantional of 1646, and therefore have a strong Saxon tradition., 922074=See Bach\u2019s Chorals, Part II. 237, where the 1625 and 1655 texts of the tune are printed., 666195=N. xviii. 72. This is a simple four-part setting in two verses. The first half of its melodic text exactly conforms to the 1687 reconstruction. The second half of it follows Vetter. Six mss. of the setting are extant, one of them being in the Kirnberger and another in the Krebs Collections., 509350=Johann Michael Altenburg 1620, 866609=Caspar Fuger the younger 1593, 532307=The movement matches those in the Orgelbuchlein as an example of Bach\u2019s poetic and pictorial treatment. Hence Schweitzer\u2019s conjecture that Bach Edition: current; Page: [198] neglected the melody in that work\u2014it is among its unwritten movements (No. 73)\u2014on the ground that it \u201ccould only be developed as pure music1,\u201d is untenable. Spitta2 holds the movement to have been composed during the Weimar period. Copies of it are among the Krebs and Walther mss., 956082=Altnikol married Bach\u2019s daughter Elisabeth in 1749., 509851=Witt\u2019s reconstruction 1715, 478745=In the Orgelb\u00fcchlein Bach attaches the titles of two hymns, Johann Roh\u2019s \u201cGottes Sohn is kommen,\u201d and Johann Spangenberg\u2019s \u201cGott, durch deine Edition: current; Page: [175] G\u00fcte,\u201d to a tune that originally belonged to neither of them, being that of the Latin hymn, \u201cAve ierarchia Celestis et pia.\u201d Its earliest printed form is in Michael Weisse\u2019s Ein New Gesengbuchlen (Jung Bunzlau, 1531), where it is set to Weisse\u2019s hymn, \u201cMenschenkind, merk eben.\u201d In 1544, simultaneously but in different Hymn-books, Roh and Spangenberg appropriated the tune to their repective hymns., 889542=J. H. Schein 1627, 808713=Martin Luther\u2019s Christmas Carol, \u201cVom Himmel kam der Engel Schaar,\u201d was first published in Joseph Klug\u2019s Geistliche Lieder zu Wittemberg (Wittenberg, 1543). The melody (supra) with which it is familiarly associated is proper to the Carol \u201cPuer natus in Bethlehem,\u201d published in the same Hymn-book, and is found as the Tenor of a fourpart setting in which the 1553 melody of the Carol2 appears as the descant. Zahn (No. 192a) seems to Edition: current; Page: [310] imply that the conversion of the 1543 melody to the use of \u201cVom Himmel kam der Engel Schaar\u201d first appears in Vulpius (1609). The hymn, in fact, had two earlier melodies of its own, both of which are reconstructions of Latin hymns: one of them (1593) being developed from \u201cA solis ortus cardine,\u201d and the other (1598) from \u201cPuer nobis nascitur.\u201d, 334310=Luther\u2019s Easter hymn, \u201cChrist lag in Todesbanden,\u201d was first published in 1524, and is described as the Easter Carol \u201cChrist ist erstanden\u201d \u201cimproved.\u201d The melody, to a greater extent than the words, is drawn from the ancient hymn. It was published with Luther\u2019s hymn in 1524 in two forms2, and is a reconstruction of the original melody of which, no doubt, Johann Walther was the author. In the Organ works, Cantatas 4 and 158 (1708-24), and Choralgesange, Nos. 38, 39, Bach uses the form printed supra. The B natural which he almost invariably substitutes for A as the first note of the fifth phrase of the tune is in Witt (No. 140), as also is C sharp for C natural as the third note of the fourth phrase. For G sharp as the second note of the first phrase Zahn reveals no earlier authority., 903677=Mr Harvey Grace in The Musical Times for October 1920, p. 671., 631752=Anon. 1535, 321832=Anon. 1535, 255914=Nikolaus Selnecker\u2019s \u201cAch bleib\u2019 bei uns, Herr Jesu Christ,\u201d was first published in his Geistliche Psalmen (N\u00fcrnberg, 1611). Actually only stanzas iii-ix are by him, being an addendum to Melanchthon\u2019s \u201cVespera jam venit, nobiscum Christe maneto\u201d Edition: current; Page: [85] (St Luke, xxiv. 29). The Alto melody (supra), which also bears the name of Selnecker\u2019s hymn, is found in a four-part setting of the hymn \u201cDanket dem Herrn, heut\u2019 und allzeit,\u201d by Seth Calvisius, in 1594. As a separate melody, however, its Alto part is at least as old as 1589. Bach uses it in the movement infra, in Cantata 6 (1736), and Choralgesange, Nos. 1, 313. His text is invariable. Its variations of the original are not traced in Zahn. In Witt (No. 476) the hymn is set to another melody, as in the Gotha Cantional (Zahn, No. 613)., 78151=On an anonymous melody dating from 1560., 742759=Matth\u00e4us Greitter 1525, 186424=The hymn is by Ambrosius Lobwasser (1515-85). Louis Bourgeois\u2019 melody, to which it is set in Witt, occurs in Edition: current; Page: [54] Cantatas 13, 19, 25, 30, 32, 39, 70, 194. \u201cAinsi qu\u2019on oit le cerf bruire\u201d is its original title. In German hymnody it is known as \u201cFreu\u2019 dich sehr, O meine Seele.\u201d, 630382=N. xviii. 69. The movement is in the Clavierb\u00fcchlein which Bach made for his wife Anna Magdalena in 1722. As Spitta points out1, it is a three-part Clavier piece, included in the Clavierb\u00fcchlein in order to give practice in the fioriture, which, it may be remarked, are not accurately printed in the Peters and Novello Editions2. Another ms. of the movement, a \u201cgute alte Abschrift,\u201d is in the Berlin Royal Library., 978368=See Bach\u2019s Chorals, Part II. 142, for the secular and 1609 forms., 962727=Moravian Hymn-book, ed. 1877, No. 1215. The original hymn has seven stanzas., 588958=N. xv. 26. The Christmas movement is a canon on the octave between the Bass and Treble, against a florid background in Bach\u2019s characteristic \u201cjoy\u201d rhythm. In the original Autograph the Pedal part Edition: current; Page: [222] is written for an 8ft. stop and is carried up to F sharp. A Pedal of that natural compass was unusual then and remains unusual now. Spitta infers1 that Bach used the Weimar Castle 4ft. Cornet stop on the Pedals. But in a movement of very similar construction, \u201cGottes Sohn ist kommen.\u201d (N. xv. 5), where the Pedal is carried up to F natural, Bach\u2019s own direction is \u201cPed. Tromp. 8 F.\u201d In N. xv. 26 the Pedal is transposed down an octave., 628474=The Easter hymn, \u201cJesus, meine Zuversicht,\u201d attributed to Luise Henriette Electress of Brandenburg, was published, set to Johann Cr\u00fcger\u2019s (?) melody, in Christoph Runge\u2019s Geistliche Lieder und Psalmen (Berlin, 1653)2. A reconstruction of the melody (supra) appeared in the Berlin Praxis pietatis melica of the same year. The melody was attributed posthumously to Cr\u00fcger, though possibly only the reconstruction is by him. Bach uses the Praxis version invariably, in Cantata 145 (1729-30), Choralgesange, No. 208, and the movement infra. Invariably he substitutes G for A as the third note of the second bar of the melody (supra), an innovation found in Freylinghausen (1704). Bach\u2019s treatment of the first bar of the second part of the tune (line 2, bar 1 supra) varies. Only in the Organ movement does he follow Cr\u00fcger\u2019s version. As his other readings differ in that passage, they may Edition: current; Page: [239] perhaps be regarded as his own. Witt (No. 712) sets the hymn to another tune., 695412=Anon. 1535, 632234=Cruger\u2019s version 1640, 852219=Georg Neumark\u2019s consolatory hymn, \u201cWer nur den lieben Gott l\u00e4sst walten,\u201d was first published, words and melody (supra), in 1657. Bach uses the tune in Cantatas 21, 27, 84, 88, 93, 166, 179, 197 (1714-c. 1740); Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 367; and the movements infra. His text is invariable. The E flat for E natural as the third note of the second phrase dates from 1682. In the second half of the tune he invariably writes A for B flat as the first note, and C for B flat as the seventh note of the second line supra, while his closing phrase differs from the original. In all these details he follows Witt (No. 553)., 484574=Wolfgang Figulus 1575 [1569], 236171=An arrangement of the second movement of Cantata 137, the Alto Unison Choral, \u201cLobe den Herren, der Alles so herrlich regieret4,\u201d in which the voice has the melody. In the Organ movement it is given to a fourfoot stop on the Pedals. The Cantata was composed in 1732 (?)., 791952=N. xix. 12. The movement, a solemn prayer, is an early work of the Weimar period, similar in form to \u201cGottes Sohn ist kommen\u201d (No. 53 supra). The ms. of it is in the Walther Collection of Choral Preludes., 416105=Anon. 1535, 678802=Bach uses the melody in Cantatas 151 and 195 (?c. 1726-40), Choralges\u00e4nge, Nos. 233, 234, and in the two movements infra. His text generally differs from that of 1554 in phrases 2 and 4. His version of both is adumbrated in texts dated 1576 and 1592. Excepting his treatment of the second phrase (the last six notes of line 1 supra) Bach\u2019s version of the melody is invariable. In the Orgelb\u00fcchlein and Cantatas 151 and 195 he adopts the 1554 form, which is also that of Witt (No. 32), but always begins the second phrase on G (not A ut supra). The source of his variation of that line elsewhere is not ascertained. An unimportant modification of the closing cadence occurs in Cantata 195 (?c. 1726)., 811066=Anon. 1572 [1571]*, 693495=Martin Rinkart\u2019s hymn, \u201cNun danket alle Gott,\u201d was first published in 1648, with the melody (supra). The latter, published anonymously in 1648, was attributed to Cr\u00fcger in 1653. It has been assigned also to Rinkart himself and to Luca Marenzio., 400819=The Christmas Carol, \u201cDies est laetitiae, In ortu regali,\u201d dates probably from the fourteenth century. \u201cDer Tag, der ist so freudenreich,\u201d an early fifteenth century translation of it, is found in many versions with a varying number of stanzas. The form translated here is in four stanzas, in Joseph Klug\u2019s Wittenberg Hymn-book, 1535 [1529], along with the melody., 716918=Besides the Organ works infra, the melody occurs in Cantatas 36, 61, and 62 (1714-c. 1740). Bach\u2019s text is invariable, with the exception that in the Eighteen Chorals and their variants he writes G sharp for G natural as the fourth note of bar 1 and second note of bar 4 supra. The modification is not found in Witt (No. 4). It produces the interval Edition: current; Page: [274] of a diminished fourth, which is very significant of suffering (cf. the \u201cCrucify\u201d theme in the St Matthew Passion and the first Chorus of Cantata 61 (1714), where the rhythm of majesty is given to the strings while the Saviour\u2019s suffering is, by this means, suggested by the voices)., 963828=A L\u00fcneburg text of 1665 has a \u266f, 152462=This version of the Benedictus is by Erasmus Alberus, and in Witt\u2019s book is directed to be sung to the plainsong of the Magnificat. As Bach introduces that melody in the next movement it may be concluded that he did not propose to use it here also. The melody proper to the hymn is dated 1564 (Zahn, No. 5854)., 508380=N. xviii. 44. The movement is a complete five-part accompaniment to the hymn for congregational singing, and may be compared with a four-part setting of it in the Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 133. The source of the text of the movement is an old ms. which belonged to Johann Nikolaus Forkel (1749-1818)., 695875=Anon. 1555, 564288=Johannes Agricola\u2019s hymn, \u201cIch ruf\u2019 zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ,\u201d was published, along with the anonymous melody (supra) in Klug\u2019s Hymn-book in 1535 [1529]. The tune is also used by Bach in the Orgelb\u00fcchlein and Cantatas 177, 185 (1715-32). His text of it is invariable and follows Witt\u2019s (No. 299)., 244445=Bach worked upon the manuscript during the illness that terminated fatally on July 28, 1750. The first fifteen Chorals are Bach\u2019s holograph. Nos. 16 and 17 are in his son-in-law Altnikol\u2019s handwriting. Of the last movement, No. 18, \u201cVor deinen Thron tret\u2019 ich hiemit,\u201d only the first twenty-five and a half bars are written in the ms. The remaining nineteen and a half bars have been supplied from the Art of Fugue, in which the movement also is found. The conclusion hardly can be evaded that Bach, tardily obsessed by desire to publish in the last five years of his life, was preparing the Eighteen Chorals for the engraver when death called him., 662291=The melody (supra) of the hymn was composed by Johann Rodolph Ahle, and was published first in his Neue Geistliche Auf die Sontage...gerichtete Andachten (M\u00fchlhausen, 1664). It is set there to Franz Joachim Burmeister\u2019s hymn, \u201cJa, er ists, das Heil der Welt.\u201d A reconstruction of the melody (supra) was attached to Clausnitzer\u2019s hymn in the Darmstadt Cantional of 1687., 438320=Nikolaus Herman 1560, 566701=Anon. 1555, 744437=Matth\u00e4us Greitter\u2019s melody, published in 1525, was from circa 1584 attached to Sebald Heyden\u2019s Passiontide hymn, \u201cO Mensch, bewein\u2019 dein\u2019 S\u00fcnde gross.\u201d Bach uses it in the St Matthew Passion (1729), No. 35, Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 286, and the movement infra. His text is practically uniform and close to that of 1525. The B naturals which replace B flat as the penultimate notes of bars 1 and 2 supra are in Witt (No. 96) and elsewhere. In the Orgelb\u00fcchlein Bach writes B natural as the third note of bar 7., 147690=The hymn, probably by Johann Niedling (1602-1668), is set in Witt to a melody (Zahn, No. 2016a) which dates from 1650. Witt may have taken it from Freylinghausen (1704), where it also occurs., 161777=The melody of this anonymous hymn is taken by Witt from a five-part setting in the Gotha Cantional of 1648 (Zahn, 2099). Bach has not made use of it elsewhere., 953093=Scottish Text Society (1897), p. 53. The translation is of a three-stanza version dated 1550., 404186=Anon. 1524, 159317=Johann Rist\u2019s hymn is set in Witt to a melody published in 1662 to Harsdorffer\u2019s \u201cWachet doch, erwacht, ihr Schlafer.\u201d Bach uses it in Cantatas 78 and 105, and there are three four-part settings of it among the Choralgesange, No. 185-187., 212985=It follows from what has been written that some, at least, of the completed movements of the Orgelbuchlein may have been composed before the publication of Witt\u2019s Hymn-book in November 1715. Three of them undoubtedly are based on melodic texts not found in Witt (Nos. 4, 98, 131). In three cases (Nos. 14, 27, 44), while using Witt\u2019s tune, Bach clearly follows another text than Witt\u2019s. In another instance the same conclusion presents itself, though less positively (No. 36)., 233366=An arrangement of the fourth movement of Cantata 140, the Tenor Unison Choral, \u201cZion h\u00f6rt die Wachter singen3.\u201d In the Cantata the melody is sung by the Tenor or Tenors in unison. In the Prelude it is assigned to an eight-foot stop on the \u201csinistra\u201d manual. The Cantata was composed in 1731, or later., 735224=Anon. 1598, 411681=Luther\u2019s versification of the Ten Commandments was published first in 1524, with the tune (supra). The latter is an adaptation, probably by Johann Walther, of the melody of the pilgrim song \u201cIn Gottes Namen fahren wir2.\u201d Besides the three Organ movements in which it occurs, Bach uses the melody elsewhere in the accompaniment to the first Chorus of Cantata 77 (c. 1725) and Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 66. Bach\u2019s text of the tune is invariable. It is noticeable that he writes G for F as the first note of the fourth line of the stanza (the ninth note of the second line supra). Therein he follows Witt (No. 222)., 117612=Copies of six movements, \u201cHerr Christ, der ein\u2019ge Gottes-Sohn,\u201d \u201cO Mensch, bewein\u2019 dein\u2019 S\u00fcnde gross,\u201d \u201cDurch Adams Fall ist ganz verderbt,\u201d \u201cEs ist das Heil uns kommen her,\u201d \u201cIch ruf\u2019 zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ,\u201d and \u201cWer nur den lieben Gott l\u00e4sst walten,\u201d originally belonging to Bach\u2019s pupil Krebs, were in the possession of Court Organist Reichardt in 1846 and of Herr Ferdinand Roitzsch of Leipzig in 1878., 533724=Bartholom\u00e4us Gesius 1601, 656573=The Litany is a recast of the \u201cKyrie summum bonum: Kyrie fons bonitatis,\u201d printed, apparently at Wittenberg, in 1541. The melody is a literal adaptation of the Latin plainsong. It is printed supra from the Teutsch Kirchenamt (Erfurt, 1525), where it is set to other words. Bach\u2019s melodic text, in Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 225, and the Organ movements infra, is invariable and follows the original (1525), to which Witt (No. 187) also conforms., 304935=? Martin Luther 1524, 280582=N. xv. 119. The 1687 melody is treated in the \u201cDeath and the Grave\u201d section of the Orgelbuchlein. The rhythm is used by Bach invariably to suggest blissful joy, here as in the Preludes \u201cHerr Christ, der ein\u2019ge Gottes-Sohn\u201d (N. xv. 9), \u201cO Gott, du frommer Gott\u201d (N. xix. 52; Partita 9), \u201cGelobet seist du\u201d (N. xv. 15), \u201cVater unser im Himmelreich\u201d (N. xv. 105), \u201cJesu, meine Freude\u201d (N. xv. 31), and \u201cLob sei dem allm\u00e4chtigen Gott\u201d (N. xv. 11). That Bach should introduce the rhythm into a hymn on Death is due to his disregard of the sinister message of the first stanza. He concentrates upon stanza iv\u2019s \u201cjoy beyond our telling\u201d and the vision of \u201cwondrous glory\u201d unfolded in stanza vii. The movement is a song of triumph over death, not a dirge for the dead and dying, nor merely instinct with the \u201ctender melancholy\u201d Spitta finds in it., 960388=Moravian Hymn-book, ed. 1877, No. 31. The original hymn has fourteen stanzas, of which iv, xi-xiii are omitted in the translation., 102977=In the Mozartstiftung at Frankfort a. Main is the Schelble collection of \u201c140 variirte Chor\u00e4le von Joh. Edition: current; Page: [16] Sebastian Bach,\u201d among which are many spurious movements. In 1846 it was in the possession of Herr Gleichauf1. It was made by Johann Nepomuk Schelble (1789-1837), founder of the Frankfort Caecilienverein and one of the earliest Bach conductors2., 662810=Besides a four-part setting of the melody in the Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 228, there are five short treatments Edition: current; Page: [253] of it among the Organ works. Bach\u2019s text is invariable only for the first phrase of the melody, which exactly follows the 1687 reconstruction, excepting the last note, where he substitutes C for A (supra). For the remaining phrases, though his text generally conforms to the 1687 reconstruction, Bach introduces into all of them variants which, generally, have their authority in Leipzig use. The five melodic texts are discussed in the sections infra. A peculiar intimacy distinguishes Bach\u2019s treatment of them all., 121425=Mendelssohn\u2019s ms. contained twenty-six of the Preludes: \u201cDas alte Jahr vergangen ist,\u201d \u201cIn dir ist Freude,\u201d \u201cMit Fried\u2019 und Freud\u2019 ich fahr\u2019 dahin,\u201d \u201cChriste, du Lamm Gottes,\u201d \u201cO Lamm Gottes unschuldig,\u201d \u201cDa Jesus an dem Kreuze stund,\u201d \u201cO Mensch, bewein\u2019 dein\u2019 S\u00fcnde gross,\u201d \u201cChristus, Edition: current; Page: [26] der uns selig macht,\u201d \u201cWir danken dir, Herr Jesu Christ,\u201d \u201cHilf Gott, dass mir\u2019s gelinge,\u201d \u201cHerr Gott, nun schleuss den Himmel auf,\u201d \u201cChrist lag in Todesbanden,\u201d \u201cJesus Christus, unser Heiland,\u201d \u201cChrist ist erstanden,\u201d \u201cErstanden ist der heil\u2019ge Christ,\u201d \u201cHeut\u2019 triumphiret Gottes Sohn,\u201d \u201cErschienen ist der herrliche Tag,\u201d \u201cEs ist das Heil uns kommen her,\u201d \u201cIch ruf\u2019 zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ,\u201d \u201cIn dich hab\u2019 ich gehoffet, Herr\u201d (alio modo), \u201cLiebster Jesu, wir sind hier\u201d (distinctius), \u201cDies sind die heil\u2019gen zehn Gebot\u2019,\u201d \u201cVater unser im Himmelreich,\u201d \u201cDurch Adams Fall ist ganz verderbt,\u201d \u201cKomm, Gott, Sch\u00f6pfer, heiliger Geist,\u201d and \u201cHerr Jesu Christ, dich zu uns wend\u2019.\u201d The last six movements Mendelssohn detached (three leaves) from the ms. and gave to his wife and Madame Clara Schumann. In 1880 the first two of the three leaves were in the possession of the wife of Professor Wach, Leipzig. The last was in that year in Madame Schumann\u2019s keeping1., 690553=Johann Cruger 1648, 651286=Bach uses the melody in Cantatas 57, 137 (c. 1732-40), in the unfinished Cantata \u201cHerr Gott, Beherrscher aller Dinge\u201d (c. 1740) and in the Organ movement infra. All of these works belong to his later Leipzig years. But though his form of the Edition: current; Page: [248] melody is fundamentally uniform, he treats it with a freedom which its spirited character invited., 118071=The Royal Library, Berlin, possesses copies of eight of the movements in the handwriting of Johann Gottfried Walther, Organist of the Town Church at Weimar during Bach\u2019s residence there: \u201cLob sei dem allm\u00e4chtigen Gott,\u201d \u201cGelobet seist du, Jesu Christ,\u201d \u201cVom Himmel hoch da komm ich her,\u201d \u201cJesu, meine Freude,\u201d \u201cDas alte Jahr vergangen Edition: current; Page: [24] ist,\u201d \u201cMit Fried\u2019 und Freud\u2019 ich fahr\u2019 dahin,\u201d \u201cHerr Gott, nun schleuss den Himmel auf,\u201d and \u201cHeut\u2019 triumphiret Gottes Sohn.\u201d, 168043=The hymn is by Johann B\u00f6ttiger (1613-72). It is set in Witt to a melody (Zahn, No. 3892b) which Bach has not used elsewhere., 147397=An anonymous hymn, set in Witt to a melody by Melchior Vulpius (Zahn, No. 2027) published in 1609 and repeated in the Gotha Cantional of 1646., 153963=The hymn is by Paul Eber. The melody was composed by Louis Bourgeois and was set originally to Psalm 134 (\u201cOr sus, serviteurs du Seigneur\u201d) in 1551. The hymn and melody occur in Cantata 130, and there are three four-part settings of the tune in the Choralgesange, Nos. 129, 130 (? J. S. B.), 132. It is familiar as the \u201cOld Hundredth.\u201d, 154444=The hymn is by Ludwig Helmbold. It is set in Witt to a tune by Joachim von Burck (1541?-1610), published in 1594. There is a four-part setting of it among the Choralgesange, No. 93., 443322=Anon. 1607, 372628=Anon. 1545, 858081=? Philipp Nicolai 1599, 301731=No. 17 is not the oldest form of the movement. B.G. xxv. (2) 157 (P. vi. 103) prints an older version of it which may be distinguished as No. 17a. In the year 1720, as will be shown, Bach revised No. 17a and produced No. 18. No. 17 seems to have been the final text, prepared for the collection upon which Bach was at work at the time of his death. With what art he creates (cf. No. 18 where the impression is less evident) an atmosphere of languor congruous to stanza i of the hymn!, 500606=Elisabethe Cruciger\u2019s Christmas hymn, \u201cHerr Christ, der ein\u2019ge Gottes-Sohn,\u201d was published, with the melody, in Walther\u2019s Hymn-book (1524). The tune appears to be an adaptation, probably by Walther himself, of the secular melody \u201cIch h\u00f6rt ein Fraulein klagen1.\u201d It occurs in the Organ movements infra and Cantatas 22, 96, 132, 164 (1715-c. 1740). Bach\u2019s text is practically invariable. For the seventh note of the second line of the melody supra he always prefers A to F. In that particular he follows Witt\u2019s text (No. 17)., 235013=An arrangement of the fifth movement of Cantata 10, an Alto-Tenor Duetto, \u201cEr denket der Barmherzigkeit2,\u201d in which the melody is played by the Oboes and Tromba in unison. In the Organ movement it is given to the \u201cdextra\u201d manual. The Cantata was composed c. 1740., 501556=N. xv. 9. The movement is one of the Advent Preludes in the Orgelb\u00fcchlein. Bach gives the alternative title of the anonymous \u201cHerr Gott, nun sei gepreiset\u201d (published in Babst\u2019s Hymn-book, 1553), to which the tune is set in Witt\u2019s Hymn-book. The hymn, however, a Grace after Meat, is included by Witt among his \u201cTisch-Ges\u00e4nge,\u201d its stanzas have no connexion with the Christmas festival and certainly were not in Bach\u2019s mind2, though Walther\u2019s (?) melody was associated with them since 1609. The rhythmic motive which Bach introduces into the Edition: current; Page: [185] Pedal expresses joyful adoration of the God-Child, to whose birth the Advent season looks forward., 944871=Moravian Hymn-book, ed. 1877, No. 733. The original hymn has four stanzas., 592954=The movement comes to us through a ms. once in the possession of Johann Christian Kittel1, who died in 1809. He was the last of Bach\u2019s pupils. Krebs also preserved a sketch of it., 265935=Michael Franck 1652, 455863=Anon. 1524, 548192=The author of the tune is not known. It is found in many forms in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century Hymn-books and probably is of secular origin. The earliest approximation to the form in which Bach knew it is found in 1573 (supra). From 1601 the first half of the tune definitely took the form Bach uses. For the second part of the melody he is not consistent. In the Orgelbuchlein he follows the 1573 text (the F sharp that ends his sixth line is as old as 1609). In the Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 172, he prefers Cr\u00fcger\u2019s (1653) text (supra). Witt\u2019s (No. 94) has peculiarities which Bach does not repeat., 780160=An older reading of the movement is in P. vii. 100. The fact that it is found in Walther\u2019s Collection, where it is inscribed \u201cJ. S. B.,\u201d is good evidence that the Prelude belongs to the Weimar period., 213527=On the other hand, there are movements for which it seems certain that Bach must have had Witt\u2019s text before him, or another identical with it; in particular, \u201cDas alte Jahr,\u201d \u201cHerr Gott, nun schleuss,\u201d and \u201cIn dir ist Freude.\u201d Witt refers in his Preface to an older Hymn-book upon which his own was based, and gives constant page references to it. There can be little doubt that he referred to the Gotha Cantional of 1646, or a later edition. Bach\u2019s familiarity with the Gotha Hymn-book of 1715 makes it reasonable to suppose that the earlier Gotha compilation was known and used in Weimar. Unfortunately there is no copy of it in this country, and for the moment it is impossible to collate Witt\u2019s book with it. Zahn\u2019s volumes, however, show that in very many Edition: current; Page: [66] cases Witt\u2019s melodic texts reproduce those of the earlier book., 463842=Anon. 1524, 602464=? Johann Walther 1524, 520201=The melody (supra) attached to the hymn in 1651 is found three years earlier in an octavo volume published at G\u00f6rlitz, entitled Pensum sacrum, Metro-Rhythmicum, CCLXVII Odis...denuo expansum expensumque Opera et Studio Tobiae Hauschkonii (1648), whose Appendix contains eighty melodies, without texts, suitable for the Latin odes in the volume. Among them (No. 45) is the melody printed supra. It occurs among several old hymn tunes, and, no doubt, dates from an older period than the volume in which it first appears. Bach\u2019s text of the melody is invariable and follows the 1648 text except in the Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 139, where he follows Witt (No. 240) in a variation of the end of the second phrase of the tune., 653428=1525, 78331=On a melody by Seth Calvisius, 1581., 614598=In Choralgesange, No. 206, and the Organ movements infra Bach uses the 1524 melody, his text of which is invariable. His version of the second and third phrases differs from the original and is found in Witt (No. 320)., 900343=Bach uses the melody in Cantatas 5, 89, 136, 148, 188 (c. 1725-35), and the Organ movements infra. His text is invariable, with one exception: in the Organ movements his second phrase of the melody follows Schein; elsewhere he writes G for F as the fifth note (supra) of it. Of this and other variations of Schein\u2019s text (A for E as the first note of bar 4 supra; A for F as the fifth note of bar 5 supra) Witt\u2019s text (No. 695) seems to afford the earliest example., 621386=N. xvii. 79. The movement must have been one of the last Bach revised. The ms. of it is in his Edition: current; Page: [236] son-in-law Altnikol\u2019s hand1. It is, however, one of Bach\u2019s early works. Schweitzer2 points to the influence of Buxtehude. Spitta3 places the composition in the first years of Bach\u2019s residence at Weimar., 112762=If Spitta\u2019s conclusion is discarded and the Autograph\u2019s construction at Weimar is assumed, the puzzling phrase \u201cpro tempore\u201d falls in smoothly with the facts known to us. Between August 1 and December 2, 1717, Bach was by appointment Capellmeister to His Highness of Anhalt-C\u00f6then. But as his Weimar master refused to release him from service and even put him in prison for begging his resignation, Bach might reasonably describe as \u201cpro tempore\u201d an appointment which seemed little Edition: current; Page: [21] likely to become permanent. The conclusion may be stated with confidence, that the Autograph of the Orgelb\u00fcchlein was written at Weimar between August 1 and December 2, 1717., 104131=In the K\u00f6nigsberg Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek is a collection of Organ Chorals made by Johann Gottfried Walther (1684-1748), Bach\u2019s contemporary at Weimar3; and also the Gotthold Bequest., 513582=Kiel was born at Ballst\u00e4dt, near Gotha, in 1584. Educated at Jena, he became pastor at Ballstadt and died there in 1626. The hymn was written for the Feast of the Purification, but was also in use for the Dying, in which mood Bach treats it., 580708=In 1591 Gastoldi published at Venice a set of \u201cBalletti.\u201d Among them is one entitled \u201cL\u2019innamorato: A lieta vita: \u00e0 5,\u201d which, in 1609, was inserted as a hymn tune in David Spaiser\u2019s Vier und zwainzig Geystliche Lieder, Sambt ihren aignen Edition: current; Page: [218] Welsch- und Teutschen Melodeyen. The tune is set there to Spaiser\u2019s hymn, \u201cO Gott, mein Herre,\u201d whose eight-lined stanza the tune exactly fitted. In 1663, if not earlier1, it was attached to Lindemann\u2019s (?) hymn in Nikolaus Stenger\u2019s Christlich-Neu-vermehrt und gebessertes Gesangbuch (Erfurt), each half of the tune being repeated in order to fit the sixteen-lined stanza., 96043=Towards the end of his life Bach published the Catechism Chorals, Prelude and Fugue in E flat, and four Duetti, in Part III of the Clavier\u00fcbung; the six Schubler Chorals: the Art of Fugue; the Musical Offering; and the Variations on \u201cVom Himmel hoch da komm ich her.\u201d The rest of his Organ works remained in ms. When he died, in 1750, presumably they were intact. To-day only about one-third of his Organ music survives in his handwriting1. The remainder has been printed from copies made by his pupils and others., 339533=? Johann Walther 1524, 480558=Spangenberg was born at Hardegsen, Hanover, in 1484. After studying at Erfurt University he Edition: current; Page: [176] became preacher at Stolberg. In 1524 he was appointed pastor in St Blasius\u2019 Church, Nordhausen, and thence in 1546 passed to Eisleben as Superintendent. He died there in 1550., 387508=On the other hand, the melody (supra), which has borne the name of the hymn since 1608, is generally attributed to Johannes Steurlein, son of the first Lutheran pastor at Schmalkalden, where he was born in 1546. About 1580 he became Town-clerk Edition: current; Page: [139] of Wasungen, whence he passed in 1589 to Meiningen, of which he became Mayor. He died there in 1613. He was an excellent musician and published various melodies and four-part settings by himself. In 1588 his melody was set to Nikolaus Herman\u2019s \u201cGott Vater, der du deine Sonn,\u201d though the latter has a four-line stanza. In 1608 Erhart Bodenschatz attached the tune to \u201cDas alte Jahr vergangen ist\u201d in his Harmoniae angelicae Cantionum Ecclesiasticarum (Leipzig, 1608), and thenceforward the hymn and melody have been associated invariably. A four-lined reconstruction of the tune is set to the hymn in the Darmstadt Cantional of 1687, and a six-lined version of it, which Bach follows literally in the Orgelbuchlein and Choralges\u00e4nge, Nos. 55, 56, is found in Witt (No. 57), but not earlier in print., 629955=Luise Henriette, to whom the hymn is attributed, was born at the Hague in 1627. She was a granddaughter of William the Silent, Prince of Orange, wife (1646) of Frederick William the \u201cGreat Elector\u201d of Brandenburg, and great-grandmother of Frederick the Great. She died in 1667., 370628=Bach is not consistent in his statement of the melody. In the Choralges\u00e4nge and Orgelb\u00fcchlein he adopts the early 1531 text. In the St John Passion he uses a Leipzig reconstruction of the tune which dates from 15981. Witt (No. 95) uses the older form., 746645=Anon. 1553, 787979=Luther\u2019s versification of the Lord\u2019s Prayer, \u201cVater unser im Himmelreich,\u201d was first published, with an anonymous melody (supra), in 1539. Fr. Zelle1 supposes the tune in origin a \u201cBergmannslied.\u201d Bach uses it in Cantatas 90, 101, 102 (1731-c. 1740), Choralgesange, No. 316, St John Passion (1723), No. 5, and four Organ movements infra. Excepting a single detail, his melodic text is invariable and conforms to the original: in the three Cantatas, the Orgelb\u00fcchlein, and N. xvi. 61 he substitutes B for G sharp as the thirteenth note of the second line supra. Witt (No. 232) has G sharp there., 572151=N. xv. 113. The movement is the second in the \u201cIn Time of Trouble\u201d section of the Orgelbuchlein. It is described as \u201calio modo,\u201d i.e. the melody Bach uses is different from that to which the hymn is set in Witt (No. 606). Bach\u2019s tune, a pre-Reformation Easter melody, occurs in a fifteenth century ms. now in the Royal Library, Berlin, set to the hymn \u201cChrist ist erstanden\u201d or \u201cChristus ist erstanden.\u201d Edition: current; Page: [214] It is found in print, set to the latter hymn, in 1536. In 1555 Valentin Triller, describing it as old and well-known, set it to the Easter hymn \u201cErstanden ist uns Jesus Christ.\u201d Five years later, with an altered last line, the tune was attached to Reissner\u2019s \u201cIn dich hab\u2019 ich gehoffet, Herr,\u201d in the Strasbourg Gros Kirchen Gesangbuch (1560). The Easter associations of the tune throw light upon Bach\u2019s treatment of it in this movement., 116552=The fullest collection of them, after the Autograph, is in Kirnberger\u2019s hand; in 1878 it was in the possession of Professor Wagener of Marburg, whose Edition: current; Page: [23] collection is in the Royal Library, Berlin. The collection contains all the completed (forty-six) movements except the first \u201cLiebster Jesu, wir sind hier1\u201d and \u201cKomm, Gott, Sch\u00f6pfer, heiliger Geist.\u201d, 379843=The tune occurs only in the Orgelb\u00fcchlein. Bach\u2019s form of the cantus differs in lines 2, 3, and 4 from the 1545 text. He closely follows Witt (No. 113), whose version is sanctioned generally by sixteenth century usage., 359879=Both words and melody of Luther\u2019s \u201cChristum wir sollen loben schon\u201d are adapted from Coelius Sedulius\u2019 Christmas hymn, \u201cA solis ortus cardine,\u201d whose melody is printed supra from a text of 1537. The adaptation of the tune to Luther\u2019s stanzas was probably undertaken by Johann Walther, in whose Hymn-book, printed at Wittenberg in 1524, it first appeared1. Bach uses the tune, in its original form, in Cantata 121 (c. 1740) and in two Organ Preludes. Witt (No. 34) prints the tune in another form., 125894=When Griepenkerl edited the Orgelb\u00fcchlein in 1846 he suppressed all reference to the movements Bach projected but did not write, and\u2014a more serious fault\u2014printed the completed movements in alphabetical order, alleging, with consummate audacity, that \u201cBach himself attached no value to the order of succession\u201d! On the contrary, Bach wrote the hymns into the Autograph in accordance with a carefully thought-out programme, which, however, he left concealed. The order in which the hymns appear in the Autograph is the only Edition: current; Page: [29] clue to it. In 1878 Rust pointed out, in the Preface to the Bachgesellschaft\u2019s Edition, that \u201cthe Chorals of the Orgelb\u00fcchlein are in the order of the Church\u2019s year.\u201d But Rust\u2019s analysis probed no deeper than the early movements and is inaccurate for the rest., 111752=\u201cAs may be seen by the title-page,\u201d writes Spitta1, the Orgelb\u00fcchlein was \u201cwritten at C\u00f6then.\u201d The conclusion has been adopted by later writers and is accepted in the Novello Edition. It does not survive examination, however. Bach describes himself on the title-page as \u201cpro tempore\u201d in the service of C\u00f6then. Spitta explains the phrase as Bach\u2019s manner of stating the fact, that though the Autograph was written at C\u00f6then, its contents had been composed at Weimar. But, surely, if that was Bach\u2019s intention, it would have been more natural to state on the title-page (which, after all, was not written for publication) the earlier position he had since vacated. In other words, writing at C\u00f6then, as Spitta supposes, we should expect Bach to call himself \u201csometime Concertmeister to the Duke of Saxe-Weimar.\u201d, 179238=The hymn is by Caspar Schmucker. Witt directs it to be sung to the tune \u201cWas mein Gott will\u201d (see No. 89 supra). Its proper melody is found in the Gotha Cantional of 1648 (Zahn, No. 7578). Bach has not used it elsewhere., 378640=Boschenstein was born at Esslingen, in W\u00fcrtemberg, in 1472. In 1514 he published a Hebrew grammar at Augsburg and in 1518 settled at Wittenberg (where Melanchthon was his pupil) as a teacher of Greek and Hebrew. Later he taught Zwingli Hebrew at Zurich. He died in 1539 or 1540 at N\u00f6rdlingen., 585017=Anon. 1535, 969052=Moravian Hymn-book, ed. 1877, No. 1182: Chorale Book for England, No. 137. The original hymn has five stanzas. The last two lines of each are repeated to the melody., 298778=The hymn and melody appeared together in the third part of the Teutsch Kirch\u0113amt mit lobgsengen (Strasbourg, 1525). The words are by Wolfgang Dachstein, to whom the melody also is assigned. He was Organist of Strasbourg Cathedral, and later, having become a Protestant, of St Thomas\u2019 Church there. He died circa 1561., 820044=? Philipp Nicolai 1599, 99830=In the K\u00f6nigliche Bibliothek are Bach\u2019s Autographs of the Orgelb\u00fcchlein, Anna Magdalena\u2019s Clavierb\u00fcchlein (1722), Notenbuch (1725), W. F. Bach\u2019s Clavierb\u00fcchlein (1720), the \u201cVom Himmel hoch\u201d Variations, and the Eighteen \u201cGreat\u201d Preludes. It possesses also the collection of Count Voss of Berlin, who purchased from Bach\u2019s eldest son, Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, a large number of his father\u2019s mss.1; the collection of Rudolf Westphal, a well-known writer on Bach2; Professor Fischhof\u2019s Bequest3; an important collection made by Johann Nikolaus Forkel (1749-1818), Director of Music in the University of G\u00f6ttingen, author of the first Edition: current; Page: [15] \u201cLife\u201d of Bach (1802)1; the \u201cSammelbuch\u201d or \u201cSammelband\u201d of Johann Ludwig Krebs (b. 1713), a student at the Leipzig Thomasschule under Bach from 1726 to 17352; a collection of Bach\u2019s Organ compositions made by his last pupil, Johann Christian Kittel, organist at Erfurt (d. 1809), in a copy made by Herr Grasnick3; copies of Bach\u2019s Organ works made by Johann Peter Kellner, a pupil of Bach\u2019s contemporary Johann Schmidt4., 514297=Bach\u2019s version of the melody is a combination of the descant and Quinta vox of Altenburg\u2019s five-part setting. Bach, however, was not the author of the reconstruction. In the Gotha Cantional of 1646 the positions of the descant and Quinta vox of 1620 are reversed, the latter becoming the melody. Witt (No. 81), in 1715, formed a new melody by piecing together parts of the original descant and Quinta vox1. His version passed into the Hymn-books of Telemann (1730), Konig (1738), and Freylinghausen (1741). His variation of the second phrase seemingly is his own. Bach uses the tune only in the Orgelbuchlein., 102222=The Amalienbibliothek of Bach\u2019s works, made by Princess Anna Amalia, sister of Frederick the Great, passed, after her death in 1787, into the possession of the Joachimsthal Gymnasium, Berlin. It contains a collection of 24 Choralvorspiele of Bach\u2019s5, made by Johann Philipp Kirnberger, who was born at Saalfeld in Thuringia in 1721, was Bach\u2019s pupil at Leipzig from 1739-41, and eventually became Court musician to Princess Amalia of Prussia6., 826081=Louis Bourgeois 1547, 468624=Luther\u2019s hymn, \u201cGelobet seist du, Jesu Christ,\u201d was published in 1524, in Johann Walther\u2019s Hymnbook. Words and melody are derived from the Christmas Sequence, \u201cGrates nuncomnes reddamus,\u201d the plainsong of which is printed supra. Its simplification was accomplished, presumably, by Walther himself. Outside the Organ movements infra Bach uses the tune in Cantatas 64, 91 (1723?-c. 1740); Christmas Oratorio (1734), Nos. 7, 28; Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 107. His melodic text follows Witt (No. 19) and is invariable, except in one detail. In one Organ movement (N. xviii. 37) B natural replaces C as the sixth note of the melody. The variant is found in an early text (1535), but is not in Witt., 603492=Anon. 1535, 117200=A smaller collection, revised by Bach himself, which contains \u201cGottes Sohn ist kommen,\u201d \u201cChrist lag in Todesbanden,\u201d \u201cVater unser im Himmelreich,\u201d \u201cIch ruf\u2019 zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ,\u201d \u201cWenn wir in h\u00f6chsten N\u00f6then sein,\u201d and \u201cAch wie nichtig, ach wie fl\u00fcchtig,\u201d was in 1878 in the possession of Wilhelm Rust, who acquired it from his grandfather, F. W. Rust., 738005=There are two forms of the ancient melody of the \u201cAgnus Dei\u201d adapted by Nikolaus Decius to his translation of that hymn: the original published in 1542, and a later version published in 15452. The latter is in use particularly in North Germany and Bach uses it with textual variations, chiefly in the fourth phrase of the tune. It occurs in the St Matthew Edition: current; Page: [283] Passion (1729), No. 1, Choralgesange, No. 285, and the two Organ movements infra. In the second of them (No. 110) Bach\u2019s melodic text approximates to a reconstruction of the 1545 version found in an Eisleben Hymn-book of 1598 (supra)., 118719=MSS. of \u201cHerr Christ, der ein\u2019ge Gottes-Sohn\u201d and \u201cEs ist das Heil uns kommen her\u201d are in a collection of Choral arrangements made by Walther of Weimar, in the possession (1878) of Herr Frankenberger, Director of Music at Sondershausen., 282356=1545, 363326=1531, 519125=The hymn, \u201cHerr Jesu Christ, dich zu uns wend\u2019,\u201d was first published (stanzas i-iii) in Johann Niedling\u2019s Lutherisch Hand-B\u00fcchlein (Altenburg, 1648). It was repeated, with the melody (supra) Edition: current; Page: [192] and the fourth stanza, in the Cantionale Sacrum (Gotha, 1651). The hymn is attributed, on inconclusive evidence, to William II, Duke of Saxe-Weimar. He was born in 1598, studied music, among other subjects, at Jena, fought in the Thirty Years\u2019 War on the Protestant side, and died in 1662. The hymn is entitled \u201cFrommer Christen Hertzens-Seufftzerlein umb Gnade und Beystand des Heiligen Geistes, bey dem Gottesdienst vor den Predigten\u201d (A heartfelt petition of pious Christians for grace and the help of the Holy Spirit, during Divine Service before the sermon). It was in use in Saxony on all Sundays and festivals., 104551=Of private collections the most important is that of Herr K\u00e4mmersinger Joseph Hauser, of Carlsruhe. It was largely used by Griepenkerl in 1846, when it was in the possession of the singer Franz Hauser (1794-1870), a friend of Mendelssohn and an avid Bach collector4. Included in the collection is a volume of \u201c50 variirte und fugirte Chor\u00e4le\u201d in the handwriting of Johann Christoph Oley, organist at Aschersleben (d. 1789), and a ms. \u201cDer anfahende Organist\u201d in the handwriting of Herr Dr\u00f6bs, a pupil of J. C. Kittel, which contains Organ movements by Bach., 378184=The Passiontide hymn, \u201cDa Jesus an dem Kreuze stund,\u201d was written by Johann B\u00f6schenstein, and is found in an undated broadsheet circa 1515. Whether Edition: current; Page: [135] it is a translation of Peter Bolandus\u2019 \u201cStabat ad lignum crucis\u201d cannot be stated positively., 599110=Johann Franck\u2019s hymn, \u201cJesu, meine Freude,\u201d was published, to Johann Cr\u00fcger\u2019s melody (supra), in 1653. Bach uses it in Cantatas 12, 64, 81, 87 (c. 1723-35?), and a Motett (1723). A collation of his texts proves Bach to have used at different times three forms of the melody. In the Organ movements infra and, as far as it goes, in a fragment upon the melody in his son Friedemann\u2019s Clavierb\u00fcchlein (P. v. 112) he follows Witt\u2019s (No. 337) version of the 1653 text. In the Motett, Cantata 81, and Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 195, he prefers a version of the second and penultimate phrases of the tune not found in print, according to Zahn (No. 8032), before 1730. As the Motett and Cantata were composed in 1723-24, this version of the melody may be attributed to Bach himself, a deduction supported by the circumstance that it is printed for the first time in the Hymn-book (1730) of his Leipzig contemporary Georg Philipp Telemann. In Cantatas 64 and 87, the latter of which is assigned conjecturally to 1735, Bach employs a third form, whose source is not disclosed, the first part of which reverts to his earlier pre-Leipzig use., 132757=The hymn is not in Witt. It is by Michael Sachse (1542-1618) and was sung to the tune \u201cGelobet seist du, Jesu Christ.\u201d As Bach treats that tune in No. 7 infra, it is to be inferred that he had in mind here the melody proper to the hymn, by J. Michael Altenburg, first printed in 1623 (Zahn, No. 1748)., 908413=Schweitzer, i. 161; Spitta, iii. 247. Herr Grasnick, of Berlin, died in 1877., 299187=There are two movements upon the melody in the Organ works\u2014in the Eighteen Chorals and among the miscellaneous movements (F\u00fcnfstimmig). Griepenkerl states that Krebs\u2019 copies of the two are marked respectively \u201cVers 2\u201d and \u201cVers 1.\u201d They display a close relation in tonality, atmosphere, and construction. Both are in G major. Both are inspired by the word \u201cWasserfl\u00fcssen\u201d (waves). In quavers, against the crotchets of the cantus, the accompaniment ripples on pellucidly in a figure which, in No. 18 especially, is reminiscent of Schubert\u2019s familiar \u201cBarcarolle.\u201d Though No. 17 is six bars longer than No. 18, the two movements are otherwise similar. Practically they are built upon the same Bass, and their contrapuntal accompaniment to the cantus is constructed out of the opening two lines of the melody. In No. 17 the close is prolonged upon a final (tenth) statement of the opening phrase of the cantus. The melody also occurs in Choralgesange, No. 23. In the penultimate bar (supra) E flat for E natural as the sixth note was Edition: current; Page: [104] general after 1653. Witt (No. 601) has it and also Bach\u2019s B natural as the penultimate note of bar 4 supra. Of Bach\u2019s B natural as the third note of bars 2 and 4 Zahn (No. 7663) affords no earlier example., 755004=Johann Cruger 1649, 176281=The hymn is by Ambrosius Blaurer (1492-1564). It is set in Witt to \u201cWas mein Gott will, das g\u2019scheh\u2019 allzeit\u201d (No. 89 supra). Its proper melody (Zahn, No. 7574) bears a likeness to the latter. Bach has not used it elsewhere., 263933=N. xviii. 2. In one of the eleven mss. of the movement (Schelble-Gleichauf) the composition, like No. 2 above, is attributed to Walther and is marked \u201cVers. 4.\u201d Bach\u2019s authorship does not appear to be in doubt. Ernst Naumann (B.G. xl. Introd. xvii) suggests that Bach communicated it to Walther when they were neighbours in Weimar., 158952=The hymn is by Erhart Hegenwalt. The melody, probably by Johann Walther, was published with the hymn in 1524. Bach uses it in the miscellaneous Preludes. There is a four-part setting of it among the Choralgesange, No. 78., 977753=Ed. 1877, No. 286. The original hymn has eleven stanzas, of which vi and viii are omitted in the translation., 273957=Anon. 1687, 693811=In addition to the Organ movement infra, Bach uses the melody in Cantatas 79, 192 (c. 1732-5), the Wedding Chorals (No. 3), and Choralgesange, No. 257. His text is invariable. His versions of the second and last lines of the melody differ from the 1648 form and are found in Witt (No. 386)., 728989=The melody (supra) is found for the first time in the New Ordentlich Gesang-Buch (Hanover, 1646), set to Johann Heermann\u2019s hymn, \u201cGross ist, O grosser Gott.\u201d A widespread and erroneous impression that Bach composed it arose, presumably, from the fact that his harmonized version of the melody is found in Schemelli\u2019s Hymn-book (1736) (Erk, No. 103). Elsewhere it occurs only in the Organ works. His version of the last two phrases of the tune is not uniform. In the Organ Partite infra it approximates significantly to a Hamburg text of 1690. Witt (No. 527) uses another melody., 661989=Clausnitzer was born at Thum, in Saxony, in 1618. He graduated at Jena University in 1643 and became an army chaplain in Swedish service during the Thirty Years\u2019 War. Upon the conclusion of peace in 1648 he was appointed pastor at Weiden, where he died in 1684., 651103=Nachtenh\u00f6fer was born at Halle in 1624, became deacon and later pastor at Meder, and eventually (1671) pastor in Coburg. He died in 1685., 665749=N. xviii. 71. The melodic text of the movement conforms to the 1687 reconstruction, excepting the third phrase, whose source is not ascertained; probably it is Bach\u2019s own. The authorities for the movement are as in No. 91 supra., 316481=The evening hymn \u201cChrist, der du bist der helle Tag,\u201d or, as was its original title, \u201cChriste, du bist der helle Tag,\u201d is a translation of the Ambrosian Lenten hymn \u201cChriste, qui lux es et dies,\u201d written by Erasmus Alberus, the son of a pastor, born at Sprendlingen circa 1500. After studying at Wittenberg under Luther and Melanchthon, Alberus worked as a schoolmaster until, in 1528, he was appointed pastor at Sprendlingen and Gotzenhain. Later he settled at Magdeburg, and was present during the long siege of the city in 1550-51. In 1552 he was appointed preacher at St Mary\u2019s Church, Neu Brandenburg, and died in 1553. His hymns were written specially for children and have been ranked after Luther\u2019s in the literature of the Reformation., 235625=An arrangement of the third movement of Cantata 6, the Soprano Unison Choral, \u201cAch bleib\u2019 bei uns, Herr Jesu Christ3,\u201d in which the voice has the melody. In the Organ movement it is given to the \u201cdextra\u201d manual. The Cantata was composed in 1736., 550970=Anon. 1589, 106927=Other collections drawn upon in 1846 and 1893 were those of the publishers Breitkopf and Haertel; S. W. Dehn (1799-1858), sometime Keeper of the Department of Music in the K\u00f6nigliche Bibliothek3; and Christian Friedrich Schwenke (1767-1822), Edition: current; Page: [18] successor to Philipp Emmanuel Bach at Hamburg and an industrious Bach collector1., 479533=Johann Roh\u2019s Christmas hymn, \u201cGottes Sohn ist kommen,\u201d first appeared in the second German Hymn-book of the Bohemian Brethren (Ein Gesangbuch der Br\u00fcder inn Behemen und Merherrn), published at N\u00fcrnberg in 1544, with the tune (supra)., 547141=This hymn or ballad of the Passion was written by Heinrich M\u00fcller\u2014the initial letters of its thirteen stanzas spell \u201cHeinrich M\u00fcler.\u201d The last two lines of the last stanza repeat his name, and state that the hymn was written by him in prison1. He appears to have been a Lutheran of N\u00fcrnberg, imprisoned, circa 1527, by the Duke of Saxony. Released in 1539, he conducted a school at Annaberg until about 1580. The ballad was published as a broadsheet in 1527 and was included in the Rostock Hymn-book of 1531. Luther thought Edition: current; Page: [204] so highly of it that he introduced it into Valentin Babst\u2019s Geistliche Lieder (Leipzig, 1545), the last Hymn-book issued under his supervision. The first of the three melodies (supra) was attached to it there., 441383=Both words and melody of the Easter hymn, \u201cErschienen ist der herrliche Tag,\u201d are by Nikolaus Herman, and were published together by him in 1560. Bach uses the melody in the Orgelb\u00fcchlein and Cantatas 67 and 145 (c. 1725-30). Always he substitutes E for D as the sixth note of the third line of the stanza (line 2, note 7 supra). The innovation Edition: current; Page: [160] dates from a text of 1605 and is found in Witt (No. 146)., 659116=Reconstruction 1687, 914155=See the Musical Times for February\u2014March 1917., 452385=The Easter Carol, \u201cSurrexit Christus hodie,\u201d of which \u201cErstanden ist der heil\u2019ge Christ\u201d is a translation, dates at least from the fourteenth century and exists in several forms. The German hymn also is found in many versions, the one here translated being from a broadsheet printed at N\u00fcrnberg in 1544. The melody (supra) proper to the Latin Carol is found in Michael Weisse\u2019s Ein New Gesengbuchlen (Jung Bunzlau, 1531), and is the descant melody of a four-part setting (supra) in Michael Praetorius\u2019 Musae Sioniae (Part V, 1607)., 126921=In the Musical Times of January 1917 the present writer exposed for the first time the complete scheme Bach had in mind in the Orgelb\u00fcchlein. He was able later to point out1 that Bach modelled it upon a Hymn-book issued in November 1715 for the neighbouring duchy of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, edited by Christian Friedrich Witt (d. 1716), Capellmeister at Gotha. It bears the title:, 127534=\u201cPsalmodia sacra, Oder: And\u00e4chtige und sch\u00f6ne Ges\u00e4nge, So wohl des Sel.

Gotha, Verlegts Christoph Reyher, 1715.\u201d, 826567=1588, 494380=Anon. 1524, 346291=Martin Luther\u2019s Baptismal hymn, \u201cChrist unser Herr zum Jordan kam,\u201d was written, probably, in 1541. Johann Walther\u2019s (?) melody, set to another of Luther\u2019s hymns, had been published seventeen Edition: current; Page: [123] years earlier (1524). In 1543 it was attached to \u201cChrist unser Herr\u201d and since has remained its distinctive melody. It occurs in the Organ movements infra; Cantatas 7, 176 (c. 1735); Choralgesange, No. 43. Bach\u2019s text is invariable. Zahn does not reveal early authority for his variations of the orginal text (G for A as the first note of the second phrase supra; B for A as the first note of the fifth phrase). Both details are found in Witt (No. 243)., 214561=After his removal to Leipzig in 1723 it is shown that Bach took his melodic texts from the Hymn-books of Leipzig musicians, such as Vetter and Schein. On the other hand, the melodic texts of the four-part settings among the Choralgesange seem very generally to conform to the Hymn-books of the Weimar period. Equally of the Organ movements other than those of the Orgelb\u00fcchlein, a collation of their melodic texts makes it evident that in them too Bach generally followed the Gotha tradition., 931595=Moravian Hymn-book, ed. 1877, No. 46. The original hymn has eight stanzas, of which iii-v are omitted in the translation., 231349=Zella is a small town of 4000 inhabitants, twenty miles south of Gotha in the Thuringian Forest, about one hundred miles from Leipzig. That Bach should publish his music there is curious but explicable. The place is distinguished for the manufacture of arms, and Spitta3 conjectures Sch\u00fcbler to have been the son of a gunstock maker there. The link between him and Bach appears to have been Johann Schmidt, Organist at Zella until 1746, Edition: current; Page: [73] when he resigned in favour of his son. Spitta identifies Johann Schmidt as the Johann Christoph Schmidt who, in 1713, copied out a Clavier Prelude of Bach\u2019s for his own use. If the identification is correct, the acquaintance of Bach and Schmidt was of long standing. Schmidt\u2019s, or another\u2019s, intervention, at any rate, seems to account for Bach\u2019s business relations with Zella during the last five years of his life., 105501=Philipp Spitta, Bach\u2019s biographer, possessed a large collection of Bach mss. which he placed at the disposal of the Bachgesellschaft in 1893. It contained the collection of Friedrich Wilhelm Rust, of Dresden (1739-96), grandfather of the prolific editor of the Bachgesellschaft\u2019s volumes1; a collection of Organ movements made by Johann Gottfried Walther of Weimar, at one time in the possession of Herr Frankenberger, Director of Music at Sondershausen; a ms. \u201cVerschiedene variirte Chor\u00e4le von den besten Meistern \u00e4lterer Zeit\u201d made by Michael Gotthardt Fischer and dated 1793; a collection of Organ Chorals made by Bach\u2019s uncle Johann Christoph Bach, organist at Eisenach; and a collection of J. S. Bach\u2019s \u201cvariirten und fugirten Chor\u00e4len vor 1 und 2 Claviere und Pedal,\u201d made by Johann Gottfried Schicht (1753-1823), Cantor of St Thomas\u2019, Leipzig (1810-23), through whose influence the Motetts were published by Breitkopf and Haertel in 18032., 639538=Anon. 1535, 555249=Johannes Leon\u2019s hymn, \u201cIch hab\u2019 mein Sach\u2019 Gott heimgestellt,\u201d was first published in Psalmen, geistliche Lieder und Kirchenges\u00e4ng (N\u00fcrnberg, 1589). The author was born at Ohrdruf, near Gotha, and after service as an army chaplain became pastor at K\u00f6nigsee and W\u00f6lfis. He died at W\u00f6lfis in 1597., 877895=Anon. 1524, 181964=The hymn is by J. Michael Altenburg. Witt directs it to to be sung to the tune \u201cKommt her zu mir, spricht Gottes Sohn\u201d (see No. 90 supra). Its proper melody is in the Gotha Cantional of 1648 (Zahn, No. 2524). Bach has not used it elsewhere., 114584=But the date of the Autograph does not consequently determine the year in which all its forty-six completed movements were composed. Rust\u2019s conclusion, in the B.G. Edition of the Orgelb\u00fcchlein1, that they cannot have been composed earlier than Edition: current; Page: [22] the C\u00f6then period (1718-23) is already disproved. Spitta1 gives convincing grounds for the conclusion that they were not composed at C\u00f6then, where Bach had neither an adequate instrument nor duties as an organist, but at Weimar (1708-17), where both incentives existed. For he demonstrates clearly that the Autograph is not the earliest text of the movements it contains. Felix Mendelssohn possessed a ms. in Bach\u2019s hand which contained twenty-six, and probably thirty-eight, of its forty-six completed movements. Indeed, Spitta makes out a strong case for the belief that the Mendelssohn ms. itself is a transcript of a still earlier text. It must therefore be concluded that the completed movements of the Orgelb\u00fcchlein were composed during Bach\u2019s residence at Weimar, 1708-17, between his twenty-third and thirty-third years, and assumed their final shape in the Autograph written in November 1717., 823804=Philipp Nicolai\u2019s hymn, with the melody (supra), was published in 1599. Its opening line is identical with \u201cO Lamm Gottes2\u201d and, according to Christian Huber (1682), the tune appeared in Balthasar Musculus\u2019 Cithara sacra, c. 1591, some years before its association with Nicolai\u2019s hymn. It would seem, therefore, that, as in the case of \u201cWie schon leuchtet der Morgenstern,\u201d Nicolai adapted older material., 780527=N. xix. 7. The movement has the rhythm of a funeral march. But the mood is joyful and reflects that of the second half of stanza i rather than its opening valediction. Three mss. of the Prelude exist, one of them in Dr\u00f6bs\u2019 hand., 394554=Bartholom\u00e4us Helder\u2019s New Year hymn, \u201cDas Jesulein soll doch mein Trost,\u201d was published, with the melody (supra), in the Cantionale Sacrum, Das ist, Geistliche Lieder (Gotha, 1646). The author-composer, son of the Superintendent in Gotha, was in 1616 pastor at Remst\u00e4dt, near Gotha, where he died in 1635. Bach uses the melody only in the Organ movement infra. His text shows the same variations of the original as Witt\u2019s (No. 63)., 708883=The melody, \u201cNun freut euch, lieben Christen g\u2019mein,\u201d generally known as \u201cLuther\u2019s Hymn,\u201d is said to have been written down by the Reformer after hearing a travelling artisan sing it. Its original is the secular song \u201cWach auf, wach auf, du sch\u00f6ne,\u201d whose melody (supra) Valentin Triller in 1555 (Ein Schlesich singeb\u00fcchlein aus G\u00f6ttlicher schrifft) appropriated to his hymn \u201cMerk auf, merk auf, du sch\u00f6ne.\u201d Luther\u2019s melody is also associated with Bartholom\u00e4us Ringwaldt\u2019s Advent hymn, \u201cEs ist gewisslich an der Zeit\u201d (1582). In the Organ movement (infra) the names of both hymns are attached to the tune. It occurs also in the Christmas Oratorio (1734), No. 59, Cantata 70 (1716), and Choralgesange, No. 262., 472697=Anon. 1531, 391118=Bartholom\u00e4us Helder 1646, 712139=Anon. 1531, 772763=Griepenkerl published the Variations for Peters in 1846 partly from Johann Ludwig Krebs\u2019 ms., partly from a copy in the possession of Carl Ferdinand Becker, a Leipzig organist and Bach enthusiast. The former contains only Partite 1, 2, 4, 10. The latter places Partita 7 before Partita 6. The Voss, Westphal, Forkel mss., among others, contain copies., 817314=Ludwig Helmbold\u2019s hymn, \u201cVon Gott will ich nicht lassen,\u201d was written circa 1563 to a secular melody, \u201cIch ging einmal spazieren,\u201d and was published along with it in 1572 [1571]. Its relation to Paul Eber\u2019s \u201cHelft mir Gott\u2019s G\u00fcte preisen\u201d has Edition: current; Page: [313] been discussed already1. It occurs in Cantatas 11, 73, 107 (c. 1725-35), the doubtful \u201cLobt ihn mit Herz und Munde,\u201d Choralgesange, Nos. 324-326, and the Organ movement infra. Zahn (No. 5264b) does not reveal an earlier example of Bach\u2019s distinctive variation of the opening phrase. It is not in Witt (No. 542). Bach\u2019s text of the fifth (notes 9-13 of the second line supra) invariably contains one foot more than the original, an elongation of the line due to the addition of a syllable\u2014\u201cEr reicht mir seine Hand\u201d for \u201cReicht mir seine Hand.\u201d, 219155=The Catechism hymns are presented in duplicate, in long and short movements. So also is the introductory \u201cKyrie,\u201d of whose three sections there are two sets. The \u201cGloria\u201d (\u201cAllein Gott in der H\u00f6h\u2019 sei Ehr\u2019 \u201d) is triplicated; each Person of the Trinity being addressed in a separate movement. Schweitzer is of opinion1 that the long movements were composed for the Clavier\u00fcbung circa 1739, and that the short movements date from an earlier period. He suggests that Bach had in mind Luther\u2019s longer and shorter Catechisms and proposed to distinguish them: the first by a series of lengthy movements sublimely symbolic; the second by Preludes of the childish simplicity characteristic of Luther\u2019s shorter exegesis., 175753=The first stanza of the hymn is by Joachim Magdeburg. It is set in Witt to a version of the original (1572) melody found in Calvisius in 1597. There is a four-part setting of it among the Choralgesange, No. 366., 916963=Wilhelm Rust, who edited them for the Bach Society, dates their publication c. 1747-49., 454214=In the single Organ movement in which he treats the melody Bach uses the original (1531) tune with the 1607 cadence. His text exactly follows Witt (No. 143)., 204535=The hymn is by Johann Rosenthal (1615-90). The melody (Zahn, No. 1208) is not used by Bach elsewhere., 167619=The hymn, whose first line also reads, \u201cIch komm jetzt als ein armer Gast,\u201d is by Justus Sieber (1628-95). In Witt it is directed to be sung to the melody \u201cHerr Jesu Christ, du h\u00f6chstes Gut\u201d (see No. 72 supra). Bach has not used the hymn\u2019s proper melody (Zahn, No. 4646) elsewhere., 858710=Anon. 1538, 146571=The hymn is a German version of the Latin \u201cSpiritus Sancti gratia Apostolorum pectora implevit sua gratia, donans linguarum genera.\u201d It is set in Witt to a melody by Melchior Vulpius (Zahn, No. 2601) published in 1609 and repeated in the Gotha Cantional of 1646. On the other hand, there exists a sixteenth century melody to the hymn (Zahn, No. 370a) which Johann H. Schein modernized in 1627 and of which a four-part setting is among Bach\u2019s Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 63. Schein was one of Bach\u2019s predecessors at Leipzig and the four-part setting may be presumed to have been written for one of the lost Leipzig Cantatas., 752785=The 1543 melody, with slight modifications, is that of the Christmas hymn, \u201cVom Himmel kam der Engel Schaar,\u201d and is used by Bach in the Orgelb\u00fcchlein for that Carol. (See No. 126 infra.), 608120=Martin Luther 1524, 958261=For the 1524 version, see Bach\u2019s Chorals, Part II. 479., 778349=Valerius Herberger\u2019s funerary hymn, \u201cValet will ich dir geben,\u201d was published, with the melody (supra), in 1614. The familiar tune is by Melchior Teschner, and bears a close resemblance to \u201cSellenger\u2019s Round.\u201d Bach uses it in the St John Passion (1723), No. 28, Cantata 95 (? 1732), Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 314, and the two Organ movements infra. His text is practically invariable. The substitution of C natural for A as the eleventh note of the first phrase of the tune is found in a Gotha text of 1648 Edition: current; Page: [299] and Witt (No. 722). Excepting N. xix. 2, Bach always writes G for E as the eighth note of the last phrase. The innovation dates from 1668. Bach\u2019s second phrase is quite distinct from Witt\u2019s., 763024=B.G. xl. 181 prints a movement on the melody whose genuineness is doubtful. The text of the second part of the tune differs conspicuously from that which Bach uses elsewhere. Five mss. of it are extant in the Schelble, Hauser, and other Collections. It is also attributed to Gottfried August Homilius (1714-85)., 530155=Bach\u2019s text of the cantus is almost invariable. He regularly substitutes C for G as the penultimate note of the melody. For the fourth note in the fourth phrase (the fifth note in line 2 supra) he very rarely (only in Cantatas 153, 161 (1715-24), St Matthew Passion, No. 72, and N. xviii. 53) follows the text of Edition: current; Page: [197] 1601; elsewhere he substitutes B flat for D. For both innovations there is early sanction; for the first, a text of 1694; for the second, a text of 1679. Witt (No. 253) adopts the first of them, but rejects the second. Bach occasionally introduces poignant variations of the original text in the second phrase of the melody (notes 8-13 supra). In No. 72 of the St Matthew Passion, No. 5 of the Christmas Oratorio, and the Organ movement infra, by a turn of the phrase he conveys an impression of wistfulness which, in the two Oratorios, certainly was suggested by the words. The fact affords a clue to the interpretation of the single Organ movement in which the melody occurs:, 646611=Anon. 1665, 579452=The hymn, \u201cIn dir ist Freude,\u201d is found first in Johann Lindemann\u2019s Amorum Filii Dei decades duae, published, perhaps at Erfurt, in 1598. It is there entitled \u201cLiebe zu Jesu\u201d (A hymn of love for Jesus), the collection of twenty hymns being described in the subtitle as \u201cWeyhenachten Gesenglein\u201d (Little Christmas Songs). The hymn, which appears without any indication of its authorship, has been attributed to Lindemann himself, but cannot positively be regarded as his., 261906=The Lenten hymn, \u201cAch Gott und Herr,\u201d is attributed to Johann Major of Jena or Martin Rutilius of Weimar. It was published as a broadsheet in 1613, and with the melody in 1625. The composer of the tune is unknown. Johann Cr\u00fcger reconstructed it (supra) in his Newes vollkomliches Gesangbuch (Berlin, 1640). A major version of his reconstruction appeared fifteen years later (1655). Bach employs it in Cantata 48 (c. 1740), Choralgesange, No. 3, and the first two Organ movements infra, where his text differs from Witt\u2019s (No. 265), which very closely follows the original (1625) version2., 606500=Bach uses the Klug melody in the Organ movement infra and Choralgesange, No. 207. With one trifling exception\u2014the substitution of G for A as the second note of the first and fourth phrases of the melody (supra) in the Choralgesange\u2014his two melodic texts are identical and conform to Witt\u2019s version (No. 144). Bach\u2019s (and Witt\u2019s) closing cadence dates back to 1585., 378982=The melody (supra) traditionally associated with the hymn appears first in Valentin Babst\u2019s Geystliche Lieder (Leipzig, 1545), and is there set to the hymn \u201cIn dich hab\u2019 ich gehoffet, Herr.\u201d The large number of texts of the tune found in the latter half of the sixteenth century proves it to be of earlier date than 1545. The first half of it is practically identical with the melody of Luther\u2019s \u201cEs woll\u2019 uns Gott gen\u00e4dig sein,\u201d which is found in use at Strasbourg in 15251. The latter tune was reconstructed by Johann Walther from pre-Reformation material, and, with \u201cDa Jesus an dem Kreuze stund,\u201d probably traces to a common, perhaps secular, source., 529069=Christoph Knoll\u2019s funerary hymn, \u201cHerzlich thut mich verlangen,\u201d was first printed in 1605. Eight years later (1613) it was attached to the tune supra. The melody had been published four years before Knoll\u2019s hymn was written. Its composer, Hans Leo Hassler, set it in 1601 to a secular song, \u201cMein G\u2019mut ist mir verwirret von einer Jungfrau zart.\u201d It is known, however, through its association with three well-known hymns\u2014Knoll\u2019s \u201cHerzlich thut mich verlangen\u201d (1613), Cyriacus Schneegass\u2019 \u201cAch Herr, mich armen S\u00fcnder\u201d (1620), and Gerhardt\u2019s \u201cO Haupt voll Blut und Wunden\u201d (1656), to which it was attached at the dates indicated. Bach uses the tune in association with all three hymns, in the Organ movement infra; Cantatas 25, 135, 153, 159, 161 (1715-c. 1740); St Matthew Passion (1729), Nos. 21, 23, 53, 63, 72; Christmas Oratorio (1734), Nos. 5, 64; Choralgesange, Nos. 157, 158., 471552=N. xviii. 39. The movement is among the miscellaneous Preludes. Apparently only a single ms. of it exists. It is in the Royal Library, Berlin, and is described as faulty and comparatively modern. Griepenkerl printed the movement in 1847 from a copy \u201cwritten by Cantor Kegel.\u201d Presumably it and the Berlin ms. are one and the same. The treatment is formal., 751859=The melody of the fourteenth century Christmas Carol \u201cPuer natus in Bethlehem\u201d (\u201cEin Kind geborn zu Bethlehem\u201d) exists in two forms. Of the original there is a text printed in 15432. The second (supra), found in 1553, is the descant of a four-part setting in which the original (1543) tune appears as the Tenor. Bach uses it in Cantata 65 (1724) and a single movement infra. His text is Edition: current; Page: [288] invariable, except that in the latter he substitutes F sharp for F natural as the ninth note of the second line supra. Otherwise his text conforms to Witt\u2019s (No. 35)., 658774=Johann Rodolf Ahle 1664, 843703=But it was not Paul Eber\u2019s hymn that Bach employed to disclose the spirit of his music. His was no cry of distress, but the simple faith of a devout nature facing eternity, and ready to meet it, with the words of a prayer of daily use upon his lips. Bach bade Altnikol inscribe the music with Edition: current; Page: [323] the title \u201cVor deinen Thron tret\u2019 ich hiemit.\u201d The hymn was first published by Justus Gesenius and David Denicke in the New Ordentlich Gesang-Buch (Hanover, 1646), and is entitled \u201cAm Morgen, Mittag und Abend kan man singen\u201d (For use morning, mid-day, and evening). Its authorship is attributed, on certain grounds, to Bodo von Hodenberg, who was born at Celle in 1604 and died in 1650 at Osterode, where he then was Landrost. The Novello Edition (xv. 114; xvii. 185) quotes Hodenberg\u2019s (?) hymn as \u201cVor deinen Thron tret\u2019 ich allhier.\u201d Fischer-T\u00fcmpel (ii. 410) does not sanction this form. The hymn had its proper melody (Zahn, No. 669) since 1695, but neither hymn nor melody was in general use: the former is not in the Unverf\u00e4lschter Liedersegen (Berlin, 1851)., 491101=Though Bach\u2019s use of the tune extends from his Weimar to his later Leipzig period, his text of the tune shows little variation. To himself must be attributed the improving change of the fifth note of the melody (supra) from B flat to C natural. Witt\u2019s (No. 56) text, which Bach otherwise follows closely in the Orgelb\u00fcchlein, has B flat and Zahn (No. 5267) does not reveal any anticipation of Bach\u2019s emendation. For the close of lines 2 and 4 of the melody (the last three notes before the middle double-bar supra), and for lines 6 and 7, Bach generally follows Schein\u2019s (1627) text, which for lines 6 and 7 reads., 110234=According to the title-page, the Autograph was written at a time when Bach could describe himself as \u201cpro tempore\u201d in the service of Prince Leopold of Anhalt-C\u00f6then. His appointment to C\u00f6then was dated August 1, 17171, though he did not enter upon his duties until Christmas 17172. To that date he held the positions of Concertmeister and Court Organist at Weimar, where the death of the Capellmeister, Johann Samuel Drese, in 1716, had opened the prospect of obtaining that vacant post. When it was given to Drese\u2019s son, Bach resolved to push his fortunes elsewhere, and, still bound to Weimar, accepted the C\u00f6then post in the summer of 1717. A petition for release from his Weimar duties was rejected. On November 6, 1717, he was placed under arrest \u201cfor obstinately insisting that his resignation should be accepted at once,\u201d and remained in confinement for a month. He was not released until December 2, 1717, when he was permitted at length to resign his Weimar appointments3., 716452=Luther\u2019s Advent or Christmas hymn, \u201cNun komm, der Heiden Heiland,\u201d a translation of St Ambrose\u2019s (?) \u201cVeni Redemptor gentium,\u201d was published in 1524, with the melody2, a simplification of that of the Latin hymn (supra), a reconstruction which may be attributed to Luther or Johann Walther., 113637=It is possible to be more precise. As will be shown, the scheme of the Orgelb\u00fcchlein can have been in Bach\u2019s mind since the autumn of 1715, but can hardly have been formed earlier. As to three-quarters of its programme the Orgelbuchlein is incomplete, and most of it was of little practical use to a Church organist. The scheme of the work, and Bach\u2019s complete neglect of it in after years, support the conclusion that it was undertaken in a period of leisure and under an immediate impulse of enthusiasm. We are drawn, therefore, to search for a period of exceptional leisure in which Bach was free to sketch and partly write a lengthy work which in after years he never attempted to complete. Such a period presented itself during his incarceration at Weimar in November 1717, and during those weeks, it may be concluded, the Autograph was written., 718604=N. xvii. 46, 49, 52. The three movements are the ninth, tenth, and eleventh numbers of the Eighteen Chorals. As they exist in a text of Walther\u2019s they must be assigned to the Weimar period. Spitta1 regards them as having been composed by Bach \u201cas a connected whole.\u201d Their tonality is identical. The first is in the Buxtehude form and the phrases of the cantus are unusually prolonged. The second is a Trio, which needs nothing but a freely invented Edition: current; Page: [275] theme to place it in the category of the Choral Fantasia. It therefore forms a bridge between the first and the third, which is a Choral Fantasia. They illustrate the hymn as a whole rather than any particular stanza. Older readings of all are in P. vii. 92, 93, 94, 96 from the Kirnberger, Krebs, and Walther Collections. Of P. vii. 93 the Autograph is in the Berlin Royal Library., 203412=The hymn is by Johann Flittner (1618-1678). The original melody (Zahn, No. 4797) is in a minor mode. There is a four-part setting of it, in a major key, among the Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 202., 643357=Luther\u2019s Whitsuntide hymn, \u201cKomm, heiliger Geist, Herre Gott,\u201d an expansion of the Latin \u201cVeni Sancte Spiritus,\u201d was first published, with the melody, in the Erfurt and Wittenberg Hymn-books of 1524. Klug\u2019s Hymn-book of 1535 [1529] prints an older form, with an expanded cadence for the concluding \u201cHallelujahs.\u201d Bach uses the 1524 form invariably for the body of the tune. In Cantatas 59 and 175 (1716-1735?) and the Motett \u201cDer Geist hilft\u201d (1729) he uses the cadence of the 1535 version. There is also an abbreviated treatment of the Edition: current; Page: [245] melody in Cantata 172 (1724-5). In the Organ movements he invariably uses the 1524 cadence (supra) somewhat altered, in a form which dates from 1569 (supra). Witt (No. 170) also prefers the 1524 text, but his cadence is quite distinct from the other versions., 430432=? Johann Walther 1524, 875666=Christoph Fischer\u2019s Passiontide hymn, \u201cWir danken dir, Herr Jesu Christ,\u201d is found in the Dresden Gesangbuch of 1597. Fischer was born at Joachimsthal, in Bohemia, in 1520. He graduated at Wittenberg in 1544, held pastoral charges at Halberstadt and elsewhere, and died at Celle in 1597. Though he was a voluminous writer, this is the only hymn known to be his., 579989=Lindemann was born at Gotha circa 1550, and from 1571 or 1572 to 1631 held a post there which he describes on his title-page as \u201cDer Kirchen und Schulen zu Gotha Cantor und Musicus\u201d (Cantor and Musicus of the Churches and Schools at Gotha). He died after 1634. The hymn passed into general use as a Christmas hymn., 773882=Melchior Teschner 1614, 873060=Anon. 1597, 481010=Bach uses the melody in the Organ movements infra, and Choralgesange, No. 115. His text is not invariable. In the Choralgesange he follows the 1531 text. In the Orgelb\u00fcchlein, where the sharpened fourth note of the melody is noticeable, he exactly follows Witt (No. 5), who substitutes B for F flat as the first note of the final phrase (supra). N. xviii. 42, on the other hand, agrees with the Choralges\u00e4nge text, the fourth line of the tune suffering some compression for metrical reasons., 192915=The hymn is by Johann Georg Albinus. It is set in Witt to a melody by Jakob Hintze (1622-1702), of which a four-part setting (with variations from Witt\u2019s text) is among the Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 17. In Cantata 162 and No. 131 infra Bach uses two other melodies., 567319=Seth Calvisius 1581, 538673=Bach uses the melody in the Organ movement infra, Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 171, but employs different melodic texts. In the Choralgesange the fourth and last phrases of the tune do not follow the original. In the Organ movement, excepting the last three bars, which are an added \u201cAlleluya,\u201d he follows the 1601 text and Witt, who also (No. 145) has three concluding \u201cAlleluyas\u201d:, 944621=The accidental is not found in the 1651 text., 262973=N. xviii. 1. Six mss. of the movement exist, one of them Kirnberger\u2019s and another in the Krebs \u201cSammelbuch.\u201d A third attributes the movement Edition: current; Page: [88] to Johann Gottfried Walther of Weimar, no doubt incorrectly. A variant text of it is in B.G. xl. 152, of which there are three mss., one of which (Hauser) is inscribed \u201cVers. 4\u201d and another (Schelble-Gleichauf) \u201cVers. 3.\u201d The latter ms. contains seven movements on the cantus by Bach and Walther. That Bach communicated to Walther his own treatments of the melody is an obvious inference., 526659=Hans Leo Hassler 1601, 324575=The ancient Easter Carol, \u201cChrist ist erstanden,\u201d dates back at least to the thirteenth century. The melody is found in print in 1513. With the words it occurs in a text of 1535 [1529]. Bach uses it in Cantata 66 (1731); Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 36; and the movements infra. Zahn does not reveal the source of his variations: nor does Bach follow Witt (No. 141). Probably they are his own., 688354=Besides the Orgelb\u00fcchlein movement (infra) Bach uses the melody in Cantatas 83, 95, 106, 125 (1711-c. 1740), and Choralgesange, No. 249. His text differs from the original form (supra) only in the substitution of B flat for B natural as the second note of the third line supra, and of B natural for A natural as the first note of the second line supra. In both particulars he conforms to Witt\u2019s text (No. 80)., 763949=? Gottfried Vopelius 1682, 156553=Ludwig Helmbold\u2019s hymn is set in Witt to its proper melody, by Joachim von Burck (Zahn, No. 443), published in 1594. The hymn appears to have no other melody., 541007=Anon. 1545, 768262=Christian Keimann\u2019s hymn, \u201cSei gegr\u00fcsset, Jesu g\u00fctig,\u201d was first published in Martin Janus\u2019 Passionale Melicum (G\u00f6rlitz, 1663). In the Wolfenb\u00fcttel Hymn-book of 1672 its stanzas are printed alternately with those of the Passiontide prayer, \u201cSalve Jesu, summe bonum,\u201d attributed to St Bernard of Clairvaulx. There does not appear to be reasonable ground for holding Keimann\u2019s hymn a version of the Latin. Two stanzas, improbably by Keimann, were added to his original five in the Gotha Geistlichen Gesang-Buchlein of 1666., 923656=Ed. 1877, No. 199. The original hymn has four stanzas., 270663=The melody, \u201cAch wie fl\u00fcchtig,\u201d was written by Michael Franck for his hymn. Words and melody were published together in 1652. In Cantata 26 (c. 1740), where the Choral is introduced twice, and in the Orgelb\u00fcchlein Bach\u2019s text of the cantus is uniform with Witt\u2019s (No. 665) and is based upon a reconstruction of the melody, perhaps by Johann Cr\u00fcger, published in 16612. The closing cadence is a combination of the original (1652) and Cr\u00fcger\u2019s texts. It dates from 1679. The title of the hymn is correctly stated in the Cantata. Bach heads the Orgelb\u00fcchlein movement \u201cAch wie nichtig, ach wie fl\u00fcchtig.\u201d Actually, \u201cAch wie fl\u00fcchtig\u201d is the first Edition: current; Page: [92] line of the first and succeeding odd stanzas, and \u201cAch wie nichtig\u201d the first line of the even stanzas., 444125=Anon. 1531, 421171=Lazarus Spengler\u2019s penitential hymn, \u201cDurch Adams Fall ist ganz verderbt,\u201d was first published in the Hymn-book which Johann Walther, in collaboration with Luther, issued in 1524. The melody (supra) which bears its name did not appear in association with it until the publication of Joseph Klug\u2019s Hymn-book at Wittenberg in 1535 [1529]. The tune, the \u201cPavier Tone,\u201d is said to have been sung at the Battle of Pavia in 1525. Bach employs it elsewhere in Cantatas 18 and 109 (1713: c. 1731). In the Organ movements he gives the sixth and last lines eight feet. In Witt (No. 291) and the Cantatas, as in the original, they have seven. Otherwise Bach\u2019s text is invariable., 138926=The hymn, by Johann Rist, written for special use on Good Friday, is described as a \u201cKl\u00e4gliches Grab-Lied uber die trawrige Begr\u00e4bnisse unseres Heylandes Jesu Edition: current; Page: [35] Christi.\u201d In Witt the hymn is set to its own melody, published, with the hymn, in 1641. Bach intended to use it here, as the sketch of the opening bars in the Autograph shows1. There is a four-part setting of it among the Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 288., 764446=Witt\u2019s version 1715, 792274=In addition to the above movement, B.G. xl. 183, 184 prints two of doubtful authenticity. Both are among the Kirnberger mss. and are attributed to Georg Bohm, of L\u00fcneburg, Bach\u2019s contemporary there, who died circa 1734., 884866=Anon. 1699, 605793=Luther\u2019s Easter hymn, \u201cJesus Christus, unser Heiland, Der den Tod \u00fcberwand,\u201d was first published in 1524, in Walther\u2019s Wittenberg Hymn-book and in the Erfurt Enchiridion. In Walther\u2019s book it is set to the first and second melodies printed supra. Both are the Tenor of a four-part setting probably composed by Walther himself. In the Enchiridion only the second tune is found. The hymn was repeated in Klug\u2019s Hymn-book, 1535 [1529], but with a new melody, the third of those printed supra, which has displaced the earlier ones. Its source is not determined., 939106=Novello\u2019s edition, 1908, p. 153., 216883=The work was published in 1739, or at latest at Easter 1740; price, three thalers1., 709941=Bach\u2019s text of the melody is invariable and differs, as to the third and fourth phrases (line 2 of the 1535 melody supra), from the 1535 form. His variants are found in late sixteenth century texts and also in Witt (No. 293). The third phrase of the tune in Hymns Ancient and Modern, No. 52, it may be noted, occurs in a 1598 text., 463385=1524, 246522=Wilhelm Rust\u2019s conclusion that the Eighteen Chorals were composed during the Leipzig period is contested by Spitta and Schweitzer2 and is generally held to be inaccurate. For the most part their composition dates from the Weimar period, when Bach was still influenced by Buxtehude, Pachelbel, and B\u00f6hm. The large number of early texts of them supports the conclusion., 665040=N. xviii. 70. The melodic text of the movement conforms to the 1687 reconstruction, except in the third phrase, which is first found in Vetter\u2019s Hymn-book (1709). The melodic text of the Choralges\u00e4nge setting is identical with that of this movement, allowance being made for the free figures that embellish the latter. Both are in the key of G major. Peters printed the movement from Kittel\u2019s ms. The Dr\u00f6bs ms. provides another copy., 793130=? Martin Luther 1539, 239200=The \u201cSozietat der musikalischen Wissenschaften\u201d was founded at Leipzig in 1738. Its promoter, Lorenz Christoph Mizler, a student at Leipzig from 1731 to 1734, was in that period Bach\u2019s pupil for composition and the Clavier. His Society being somewhat academic in its outlook, Bach was only induced to join it in the summer of 1747\u2014Handel had been elected an honorary member two years before (1745)2., 370176=Both words and melody of the hymn, \u201cChristus der uns selig macht,\u201d are adapted from the Latin \u201cPatris Sapientia, veritas divina.\u201d The words are by Michael Weisse and were first published, with the tune, in 1531. The melody occurs also in the St John Passion (1723), Nos. 12, 35; Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 48; and the Orgelb\u00fcchlein., 140071=The hymn, a Litany, is by Hermann Bonn (c. 1504-48). The melody to which it is set in Witt dates at least from the end of the fourteenth century, when it was sung to the hymn \u201cEya der grossen Liebe.\u201d It is found in association with Bonn\u2019s hymn in 1561 (Zahn, No. 8187c). There is a four-part setting of it among Bach\u2019s Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 301., 190479=The hymn is by Cyriacus Schneegass. Witt directs it to be sung to the melody \u201cDurch Adams Fall\u201d (see No. 76 supra). Its proper melody is in the Gotha Cantional of 1648. Bach has not used it elsewhere., 300908=N. xvii. 18. The movement is No. 3 of the Eighteen Chorals. Schweitzer1 finds in it the evident influence of Georg B\u00f6hm, Organist of St John\u2019s Church, L\u00fcneburg, from 1698 to his death in 1734 (?). Spitta2, on the other hand, detects in it the example of Dietrich Buxtehude (1637-1707), Organist of St Mary\u2019s Church, L\u00fcbeck, but concurs with Schweitzer in regarding the movement as an early essay of Bach\u2019s. He dates its composition circa 1712, during the Weimar period., 594120=Johann Cruger 1653, 980260=Copyright \u00a92004 - 2015 Liberty Fund, Inc.

The melody is a simplified form of the Latin plainsong. Bach introduces portions of it into Cantatas 16, 119, 120, and 190 (1720-30), and treats it as a whole in the Organ movement infra:, 428146=Luther\u2019s hymn is a free translation of Psalm 46 and probably was written for the Diet of Speyer in 1529. The tune was adapted by Luther, certainly Edition: current; Page: [155] from the Roman Gradual. Words and melody were published together in 1531 and again in Klug\u2019s Wittenberg Hymn-book in 1535. Bach uses the tune in Cantata 80 (1730); Choralges\u00e4nge, Nos. 74-5; and the movement infra. Only in the Organ movement does he exactly follow the 1535 text in the fifth line of the melody (line 2 supra). Witt\u2019s (No. 482) text shows the same fidelity to the original., 479869=Johann Roh, by birth a Bohemian, styled himself \u201cCornu\u201d in Latin, \u201cHorn\u201d in German. In 1518 he was appointed preacher to the community of the Bohemian Brethren at Jung Bunzlau and, in 1532, became Bishop. He died at Jung Bunzlau in 1547., 673744=The melody is treated in two Organ movements. The source of Bach\u2019s variations of the 1531 text is not ascertained. In Witt (No. 15) the hymn is set to the melody \u201cVom Himmel hoch da komm ich her., 234409=An arrangement of the fourth movement of Cantata 93, a Soprano-Alto Duetto, \u201cEr kent die rechten Freudenstunden1,\u201d in which the melody is played by the Violins and Violas in unison. In the Organ movement it is given to a four-foot stop on the Pedals. The Cantata was composed in 1728 (?)., 650791=Caspar Friedrich Nachtenh\u00f6fer\u2019s hymn was first published in the Coburg Hymn-book of 1667, to the anonymous melody \u201cHast du denn, Liebster,\u201d which had appeared two years earlier (1665) in the Stralsund Hymn-book. Zahn (No. 1912) supposes it founded on a secular tune., 258373=Johann Cr\u00fcger\u2019s version 1640, 173698=The hymn is attributed to Johann Kolross. The melody, which dates from 1535, belongs also to Luther\u2019s \u201cWohl dem, der in Gottes Furcht steht.\u201d A four-part setting of it is among the Choralgesange, No. 389., 237798=The title-page bears no date, but the publication number \u201c28\u201d affords a clue. C. P. E. Bach\u2019s Clavier Concerto in D major, also published by Schmidt, bears the number \u201c27\u201d and the date admittedly is 1745. The \u201cVariations\u201d therefore must have been brought out subsequently to Emmanuel\u2019s Concerto, i.e. in or after 1745. That they were presented by Bach to Mizler\u2019s \u201cSoziet\u00e4t der musikalischen Wissenschaften,\u201d upon becoming a member of it in June 1747, is an admitted fact. According to the \u201cNecrology\u201d Bach gave the work to the Society \u201cvollst\u00e4ndig gearbeitet\u201d (completely worked-out) \u201cand it was afterwards engraved on copper.\u201d If this statement is accurate, Balthasar Schmidt can have published nothing between Emmanuel\u2019s Concerto Edition: current; Page: [76] and the Variations, two years later. The supposition is so improbable, that Bach must be held to have engraved the work before he presented it to the Mizler Society. In other words, its publication is to be assigned to the period in which the Sch\u00fcbler Chorals also made their appearance1. The Autograph is in the Royal Library, Berlin., 580370=The melody (supra), which at least from 1663 has been regarded as proper to the hymn, is by Giovanni Giacomo Gastoldi. He was born at Caravaggio circa 1556, and was successively Capellmeister at Mantua and Milan (1592). He died at Milan in 1622., 666578=Since Bach uses the 1687 or Witt form of the melody only in the Orgelb\u00fcchlein, while all the other settings show variants which are traceable to Vetter\u2019s Hymn-book, which was published at Leipzig Edition: current; Page: [255] a few years before Bach went there, it is a reasonable deduction that Nos. 91, 92, 93 and the Choralgesange setting date from the Leipzig period., 386658=The New Year hymn, \u201cDas alte Jahr vergangen ist,\u201d is first found, as a single stanza of eight lines (stanzas i and ii of the translation), in Clement Stephani\u2019s Sch\u00f6ner ausserlessner deutscher Psalm, und anderer k\u00fcnstlicher Moteten und Geistlichen lieder XX (N\u00fcrnberg, 1568). Twenty years later Johannes Steurlein included the hymn, in six stanzas of four lines, in his Sieben und Zwantzigk Newe Geistliche Gesenge, Mit vier Stimmen Componiret und in druck der lieben Jugend zu gut verordnet (Erfurt, 1588). Three of the twenty-seven hymns in the collection are marked as Steurlein\u2019s. \u201cDas alte Jahr\u201d is not among them, a fact which makes his alleged authorship doubtful. As early as 1609 the whole hymn was attributed to Jakob Tapp (d. 1630)., 805213=Anon. 1543, 396601=Anon. 1535, 229545=A copy of the original edition of the Sechs Chor\u00e4le was extant in 1847. Presumably it had been in the possession of Bach himself or of a member of his family; for it was corrected throughout in Bach\u2019s hand, with his directions for playing the movements. It was in Forkel\u2019s Collection and from him passed to Griepenkerl1. On the latter\u2019s death it came into the possession of Professor S. W. Dehn, Keeper of the Music in the Royal Library, Edition: current; Page: [72] Berlin, who died in 1858. Writing in 1878, Rust declares its then locality unknown to him. Rust possessed a second and Hauser of Carlsruhe a third copy1., 293019=Wolfgang Dachstein 1525, 939663=Moravian Hymn-book, ed. 1877, No. 19. The original hymn has fourteen stanzas, of which ii-iv, vii, viii, xi-xiv are omitted in the translation., 603152=? Johann Walther 1524, 678431=The words and melody of the Christmas hymn, \u201cLobt Gott, ihr Christen alle gleich [allzugleich],\u201d by Nikolaus Herman, were first published together in 1560. The tune (supra) had appeared six years earlier in association with another hymn by Herman. In both hymns the fourth line of the stanza is repeated., 952542=A harmonization of the 1609 melody is in the Chorale Book for England, No. 156., 623133=? Johann Cr\u00fcger 1653, 555636=Associated with Leon\u2019s hymn are two melodies, both of which are used by Bach, and are traced to the same origin, a four-part setting (supra) of the secular song \u201cIch weiss mir ein Roslein h\u00fcbsch und fein,\u201d published by Johann Rhau in 1589. The Tenor of the setting becomes the melody of Leon\u2019s hymn in a Hymn-book dated 16091 and in Witt (No. 317). Bach introduces it into the orchestral accompaniment of Cantata 106 (1711). Meanwhile, the descant melody of the 1589 four-part setting also became attached to Leon\u2019s hymn in David Wolder\u2019s Hymn-book, published in 1598. Bach uses this tune in the Organ movements infra, and there is a four-part setting of it among the Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 182. Bach\u2019s text is practically invariable. The D natural which he substitutes for F natural as the fourth note of the melody (supra) has early (1611) sanction. His variant of the opening of the second line of the stanza (notes 3-5 of line 2 supra) follows a reconstruction of the melody which Edition: current; Page: [208] became the accepted form of the tune in Hymn-books after 1601, when it first appears., 168856=Luther\u2019s hymn has two melodies. Of the older (1524) there is a four-part setting among the Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 261. The second (1529 or 1535) occurs in the Christmas Oratorio, Cantata 70, the miscellaneous Preludes, and in a four-part setting among the Choralges\u00e4nge, Edition: current; Page: [47] No. 262. The second tune has been attributed to Luther, and for that reason perhaps Bach preferred it. Witt also uses it., 318855=N. xix. 36. These \u201cChoralvariationen,\u201d it is generally agreed, are a youthful work written while Bach was under the influence of B\u00f6hm. Spitta assigns their composition to circa 1701-2, when Bach was in his sixteenth or seventeenth year, resident at L\u00fcneburg, and therefore in contact with B\u00f6hm, who was organist there1. Schweitzer2 points out that the number of Variations corresponds to Edition: current; Page: [112] the number of stanzas in the hymn. But the inference that each Variation pictures the corresponding stanza does not survive examination. It is difficult to imagine Bach tempted to distinguish in seven pictures moods so placid and invariable as the hymn maintains. He is not even moved, as in maturer years he might have been, by references to Satan and the angels; though the convolutions of the accompanying figure in Variations II, IV, VI may have been prompted by the image of the Serpent. On the other hand, it need not follow that the numerical correspondence between the hymn stanzas and the Variations is fortuitous. The opening broad and simple treatment of the melody looks like a statement of the cantus as a preliminary to singing the first stanza. The remaining movements may have been designed as improvisations between the stanzas. They are not in the ordinary sense Variations at all, but movements in Fantasia form written for the two-manualed \u201cPedalflugel.\u201d The Pedal is introduced only in the last (seventh) Variation and is marked \u201ccon Pedale se piace\u201d (i.e. ad libitum)., 576030=Witt\u2019s version 1715, 538155=The melody (supra) is found in association with the hymn in Bartholom\u00e4us Gesius\u2019 Geistliche_deutsche Lieder, published in 1601 at Frankfort a. Oder, Edition: current; Page: [200] where Gesius at that time was Cantor. The tune appears in 1601 for the first time and certainly was composed by Gesius himself., 588115=The mediaeval Christmas hymn, \u201cIn dulci jubilo,\u201d a macaronic partly German, partly Latin, dates from the early part of the fifteenth century, or earlier. It is found in various forms, of from three to eight stanzas in length. The ancient melody of the hymn was printed for the first time in Joseph Klug\u2019s Geistliche Lieder zu Wittenberg (Wittenberg, 1535 [1529])., 918791=See Spitta, iii. 294. In B.G. xlvi, p. xxi n. Kretzschmar dates the work \u201c1723\u201d but offers no proof., 933582=Ed. 1746, Part II. p. 714. The original hymn has nine stanzas., 285828=The melody, \u201cAllein Gott in der Hoh\u2019 sei Ehr\u2019,\u201d was adapted by Nikolaus Decius for his translation of the \u201cGloria in excelsis,\u201d and was published with it in 15392. The melody is a shortened version of the plainsong Easter \u201cGloria in excelsis\u201d (the first eleven lines or phrases of which are printed supra), being made up of phrases 3-4, 7-8, 11. Bach uses the melody in the Organ movements infra; Cantatas Edition: current; Page: [98] 85, 104, 112, 128 (c. 1725-35); Choralgesange, No. 12. His text is practically invariable, and closely conforms to Witt\u2019s (No. 188)., 252323=Seth Calvisius 1594, 876094=The melody (supra), which is sung to several hymns, was published first in Johann Eccard\u2019s Geistliche Lieder, Auff den Choral oder gemeine Kirchen Melodey durchauss gerichtet (Part II, K\u00f6nigsberg, 1597). The tune is attributed by Winterfeld to Eccard himself. But the many and divergent texts of it found about the year 1597 prove the Edition: current; Page: [336] melody of greater antiquity. The tune was set in 1597 to Paul Eber\u2019s hymn, \u201cHerr Jesu Christ, wahr Mensch und Gott.\u201d Bach has not used it elsewhere than in the Orgelbuchlein. Witt\u2019s (No. 135) text, like Bach\u2019s, is true to the original form of the melody., 951857=According to Winkworth (Index, p. xi) the association is found in the Gotha Cantionale Sacrum of 1646. If so, Witt\u2019s reconstruction of the tune is the more noteworthy in relation to Bach\u2019s treatment of the melody., 353652=Anon. 1537, 590613=If, as certainly was the case, the movement was designed to accompany the congregational singing of the hymn, we can understand, though not be tempted to associate ourselves with, the complaint of the Arnstadt Consistory against Bach, February 21, 1706: \u201cCharge him with having been hitherto in the habit of making surprising variationes in the chorals, and intermixing divers strange sounds, so Edition: current; Page: [223] that thereby the congregation were confounded1.\u201d It is in the Christmas hymns particularly\u2014judging by the examples that survive\u2014that Bach painted the glorious pictures which their melodies summoned before his responsive mind., 613469=The hymn is a translation, by Martin Luther, of the Eucharistic \u201cJesus Christus, nostra salus,\u201d Edition: current; Page: [232] generally described as \u201cSt Johannes Hussen Lied,\u201d though Hus\u2019s authorship is doubtful. Luther\u2019s hymn was published in Walther\u2019s Geystliche gesangk Buchleyn (Wittenberg, 1524) and in Enchiridion oder eyn Handbuchlein (Erfurt, 1524), in both cases with the tune (supra). The hymn is described as \u201cSt John Hus\u2019s hymn improved.\u201d In fact only the first of its ten stanzas is based on the Latin. Luther and his musical helper, Johann Walther, appear to have discarded the old melody of the Latin hymn. The 1524 tune is attributed, without strong evidence, to Luther himself. When the hymn was repeated in Joseph Klug\u2019s Geistliche Lieder (Wittenberg, 1535), a tune was substituted for that of 1524, which also bears no resemblance to the Latin melody., 614909=The 1524 melody appears to have been very dear to Bach. The Organ movements on it number four; two of them in the third part of the Clavier\u00fcbung, and the other two among the Eighteen Chorals., 328078=Anon. 1524, 839290=Eber\u2019s hymn was first printed as a broadsheet at N\u00fcrnberg circa 1560, and later in the Dresden New Betbuchlein (1566)., 846872=Georg Neumark 1657, 575570=G. G. Gastoldi 1609, 483042=N. xviii. 42. Spitta points out1 that the earliest form of Organ Choral, contrapuntal and without a fixed subject or episodic interludes, occurs in Bach\u2019s use only in the present movement and \u201cVater unser im Himmelreich\u201d (N. xix. 12). In both a few introductory bars imitate the first line of the melody. A copy of \u201cVater unser\u201d (N. xix. 12) is among the Walther mss., a fact upon which Spitta concludes2 that it was written at Weimar. Probably the present movement must be assigned to the same period. The ms. of it is in Andreas Bach\u2019s ms. Griepenkerl printed it for the Peters Edition from a copy \u201ccommunicated by C. F. Becker.\u201d, 424158=Martin Luther 1535, 760819=Johann Franck\u2019s Eucharistic hymn, \u201cSchm\u00fccke dich, O liebe Seele,\u201d was first published, with Johann Cr\u00fcger\u2019s melody (supra), in 1649. Bach uses the melody in Cantata 180 (c. 1740) and in the movement infra. His text of it is practically invariable. Of his variation of bars 4 and 5 (supra) Zahn does not reveal an earlier instance. Witt\u2019s text (No. 308) did not guide him., 863228=Philipp Nicolai\u2019s hymn was first published, with the melody, in 1599. The tune (supra) is a reconstruction of older material. The first half is taken, with the alteration of two notes, from the first, second, and concluding phrases of the melody (supra) to which Psalm 100, \u201cJauchzet dem Herren, alle Land,\u201d is set in Wolff K\u00f6phel\u2019s Psalter, published in 1538. The concluding phrase of Nicola\u012b\u2019s tune also is modelled on that original. The opening phrase of Edition: current; Page: [331] the second part of his tune (line 7 of the hymn) is identical with one in the old Carol \u201cResonet in laudibus,\u201d whose opening phrase, moreover, bears close similarity to \u201cJauchzet dem Herren,\u201d a fact, perhaps, which drew Nicolai\u2019s attention to it., 309141=Written in 1523, Luther\u2019s free translation of Psalm 130 was first published in 1524, along with the melody. The tune is known as \u201cLuther\u2019s 130th\u201d and with some probability may be regarded as his composition. Bach makes little use of it. It occurs only in the movements infra and Cantata 38 (c. 1740). It is among the unwritten movements of the Orgelb\u00fcchlein. Bach\u2019s melodic text is invariable. Witt (No. 261) uses another (1525) melody for the hymn., 436343=N. xviii. 35. The cantus is set to an accompaniment unique in Bach\u2019s Organ music. Spitta3 finds a counterpart to it in an arrangement of \u201cVater unser im Himmelreich,\u201d by B\u00f6hm, and concludes that Bach\u2019s movement was composed at L\u00fcneburg under B\u00f6hm\u2019s immediate influence, at the period in Edition: current; Page: [158] which the Variations upon \u201cChrist, der du bist der helle Tag\u201d were written, i.e. circa 1701-2, when Bach was sixteen or seventeen years old. On the other hand, Johann Kuhnau (d. 1722), Bach\u2019s predecessor at Leipzig, issued in 1700 six Clavier Sonatas illustrating certain Bible stories. Into the first of them, depicting the fight between David and Goliath, he introduces the melody \u201cAus tiefer Noth\u201d in the right hand against repeated quaver chords in the left. As a young man Bach probably knew this work. His wistful accompaniment\u2019s congruity to the mood of Hegenwalt\u2019s hymn is apparent., 312393=Anon. 1568, 350372=Anon. 1557, 734299=The ms. from which the Partite were published by Griepenkerl in 1846 belonged to Johann Nikolaus Forkel (1749-1818). Another ms. is in the Collection of Bach\u2019s pupil Krebs, and bears the inscription \u201cJ. S. B.\u201d Naumann mentions a third copy by F. Roitzsch in Dehn\u2019s Collection, inscribed \u201cda Giov. Bast. Bach.\u201d, 230570=After 1744 Bach appears to have abandoned the composition of Church Cantatas, which to that point occupied so much of his time at Leipzig, and devoted himself to his Organ works. During the last five years of his life the Canonic Variations on \u201cVom Himmel hoch,\u201d the Musikalisches Opfer (Musical Offering) to Frederick the Great, and the Sechs Chor\u00e4le were published. The Kunst der Fuge (Art of Fugue) appeared shortly after Bach\u2019s death. Excepting the Canonic Variations, all of these works were engraved by Johann Georg Sch\u00fcbler of Zella2., 232500=The Sechs Chorale were published by Sch\u00fcbler at Zella between 1746 and Bach\u2019s death in 17501. They are distinguished from the rest of Bach\u2019s Organ music by the fact that five of them positively, and the sixth with practical certainty, are arrangements of movements from his recently composed Leipzig Church Cantatas2. They are printed in the following order, to which, however, no significance attaches:, 864174=The tune occurs in Cantatas 1, 36, 37, 49, 61, 172 (1714-c. 1740); Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 375; and the movement infra. Bach\u2019s text is invariable for the first part of the melody and follows the original, except for the substitution of A for C as the first note of the third phrase, as in Witt (No. 479). For the second part of the tune Bach either keeps to the original, as in Witt (No. 479), Cantata 172 (1724-5), and the Organ movement; or follows Cr\u00fcger (1640) in substituting A and B flat for G and A as the sixth and seventh notes of line 3 supra, as in Cantatas 1 and 36 (c. 1730-40); or adopts Vopelius\u2019 (1682) text there, as in Choralgesange, No. 375., 264478=N. xviii. 3. Unlike Nos. 2 and 3 the movement is in a minor key (B mi.) and follows closely the original (1625) and Witt\u2019s versions of the tune. A copy of it in the Krebs mss. is marked \u201cJ. S. B.\u201d Another copy is in the K\u00f6nigsberg University Library, among the Walther mss. The facts therefore point to Bach\u2019s composition of all three movements in the Weimar years. In the same period, it is to be observed, Bach Edition: current; Page: [89] included the melody among the Penitential hymns of the Orgelbuchlein (No. 71)., 667690=Anon. 1531, 936204=I accept this interpretation from Mr Harvey Grace\u2019s illuminating article on the Orgelbuchlein in the Musical Times for October 1, 1920. Schweitzer (ii. 59) speaks of the phrase being repeated ten times \u201cin the Pedal,\u201d once for each Commandment. This is inaccurate., 899548=Johann Heermann\u2019s \u201cWo soll ich fliehen hin\u201d was published in 1630. The melody associated with it from the outset had been sung, since 1609, to Sigismund Weing\u00e4rtner\u2019s (?) \u201cAuf meinen lieben Gott,\u201d which was published in 1607. The tune is of secular origin, and as attached to \u201cAuf meinen lieben Gott\u201d largely retained the form of the original2. The version in later use (supra) is found in Johann H. Schein\u2019s Leipzig Cantional (1627)., 198993=The hymn is attributed, probably inaccurately, to Johannes Mathesius (1504-65). Its melody (properly \u201cHerzlich thut mich erfreuen\u201d) is found in a four-part setting among the Choralgesange, No. 30., 161354=The hymn is by Johann Heermann. The melody Witt uses is perhaps by Caspar Stieler. Bach uses it in two Cantatas of the Weimar period, Nos. 163 and 199. The melody \u201cWo soll ich fliehen hin,\u201d which he uses elsewhere, is more correctly styled \u201cAuf meinen lieben Gott\u201d (see No. 136 infra)., 149953=The Trinity section contains six numbers, of which only the last three hymns are found in Witt\u2019s Trinity group. Nos. 49 and 50 are taken by Bach from Witt\u2019s \u201cVor der Predigt\u201d (Before the Sermon) section. That Bach intended them for Trinity use is to be inferred from the irrelevance of a general \u201cBefore the Sermon\u201d group of hymns between the Whitsuntide and Trinity sections. In regard to No. 49 it is not improbable that local use at Weimar attached it to Trinity, to whose season it is generally relevant. The hymn is attributed to a former Duke of Saxe-Weimar. Its fourth stanza is appropriate to the season:, 636231=The words and melody of Luther\u2019s Whitsuntide hymn, \u201cKomm, Gott, Schopfer, heiliger Geist,\u201d are derived from the Latin \u201cVeni Creator Spiritus,\u201d and were first published in 1524. In Klug\u2019s Hymn-book (1535 [1529]) the melody, considerably modified2, approached the form in which it is universally known. In the Cantata \u201cGott der Hoffnung erf\u00fclle euch,\u201d attributed to Bach, the tune is used exactly in its 1535 form. Elsewhere, in Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 218, and the two Organ movements (infra), Bach follows a version of the melody based on Cruger\u2019s text (1640) (supra) invariably for the third phrase. Witt (No. 171) exactly conforms to the 1535 text., 513869=Johann Michael Altenburg, the composer of the melody, was born at Alach, near Erfurt, in 1584. His life was spent in and round Erfurt as teacher Edition: current; Page: [190] and pastor. He died there in 1640. He was a good musician and at one time was precentor in Erfurt., 317309=\u201cChriste, du bist der helle Tag\u201d was published in Die Morgengeseng fur die Kinder (N\u00fcrnberg c. 1556). In 1565 the hymn was published in the Edition: current; Page: [111] Hamburg Enchiridion Geistliker Leder und Psalmen along with another melody than that which Bach uses. The latter was published, with the hymn, in Cyriacus Spangenberg\u2019s Christlichs Gesangbuchlein, Von den F\u00fcrnembsten Festen, durchs gantze Jhar (Eisleben, 1568). There is no indication of the composer\u2019s identity. The tune has a pre-Reformation tone, and not improbably is a form of the old melody of \u201cChriste, qui lux es et dies.\u201d Bach uses it in the Variations infra and Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 33. In the former his text exactly follows Witt (No. 431). The other setting shows Bach to have followed another text than Witt\u2019s. It will be observed that the second line of the cantus in the Variations differs from the original (1568) version. Bach\u2019s variant is found as early as 1597. In the Choralges\u00e4nge he adopts a statement of the first line of the melody which dates from at least 1581., 870340=The Christmas hymn, \u201cWir Christenleut\u2019,\u201d was written by Caspar Fuger, whose son (?), also named Caspar, wrote the melody to it. The tune (supra), which is certainly as old as 1589, was published with the hymn in 1593. Bach uses it in Cantatas 40, 110, 142 (c. 1712-c. 1734); Christmas Oratorio (1734), No. 35; and the Organ movements infra. His text is invariable and follows the original. Witt\u2019s (No. 33) text is uniform with it., 180048=The hymn is by Jakob Peter Schechs (1607-59). It is set in Witt to a melody of which there is a four-part setting among the Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 2., 573430=N. xviii. 59. The second of the two melodies is used in this Fughetta. The tune (supra) by Seth Calvisius, one of Bach\u2019s predecessors in the Cantorate of St Thomas\u2019, Leipzig, was first published in association with Reissner\u2019s hymn in 1581. Elsewhere Bach uses it in the St Matthew Passion (1729), No. 38; Christmas Oratorio (1734), No. 46; Cantatas 52, 106 (1711-c. 1730); Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 212. His melodic text is practically invariable and shows marked divergencies from the 1581 form. His first phrase is found in Witt (No. 606). His closing cadence is in Schein (1627). He differs from Witt in his treatment of phrases 4 and 5, and his version is not traceable in Zahn. Perhaps it is his own. Only in the Fughetta (N. xviii. 59) does he follow the original and Witt in those phrases, with a single variation\u2014B flat for A as the first note of phrase 5 (the second note of line 3 supra)., 103838=The Leipzig Stadtbibliothek contains the Bequest of Carl Ferdinand Becker (1804-77), editor of the Choralges\u00e4nge and Professor of the Organ in the Leipzig Conservatorium., 490206=Two tunes are associated with Eber\u2019s New Year hymn and were published with it in 1575 [1569] by Wolfgang Figulus, Cantor in the Furstenschule at Meissen. The first of them is practically identical with the contemporary \u201cVon Gott will ich nicht lassen1\u201d and derived from the same secular song, \u201cIch ging einmal spazieren,\u201d to whose melody Ludwig Helmbold wrote \u201cVon Gott will ich nicht lassen.\u201d The second tune, presumably by Figulus himself, is printed supra in a four-part setting by him. Its Tenor, it will be observed, very closely fits the first melody. Bach uses it in the Orgelb\u00fcchlein and Cantatas 16, 28, 183 (c. 1724-c. 1736)., 279297=Johann Georg Albinus\u2019 hymn, \u201cAlle Menschen m\u00fcssen sterben,\u201d written in 1652 for the funeral of Paul von Henssberg, a Leipzig merchant, was published in that year as a broadsheet, with a five-part setting by Johann Rosenm\u00fcller. The written movement (alio modo) in the Orgelb\u00fcchlein treats a tune Edition: current; Page: [95] (supra) first published, with the hymn, in Das grosse Cantional: oder Kirchen-Gesangbuch (Darmstadt, 1687). Its author is not identified. Bach\u2019s variation of its second line is found in 1692, of the sixth in 1710, and of the last line in 1711. Witt (No. 660) uses another melody for the hymn (Choralgesange, No. 17), and Bach a third in Cantata 162 (1715)1., 97496=Bach\u2019s Organ Chorals were first edited by Friedrich Conrad Griepenkerl and Ferdinand Roitzsch for C. F. Peters, of Leipzig, who included them in his Edition of Bach\u2019s Organ Works (vols. v, vi, vii, ix) in 1846-47-81. In 1893 Ernst Naumann edited a larger collection of them for the Bachgesellschaft (Jahrgang xl). Nine years later (1902) the same editor included most of them in Breitkopf and Haertel\u2019s Edition. To the contents of the latter collection the Novello Edition (1916) makes no addition., 460253=The words and melody of Paul Speratus\u2019 (Offer or Hoffer) hymn were published in 1524 in the first Lutheran Hymn-book. Bach uses the melody in the Orgelbuchlein; Cantatas 9, 86, 117, 155, 186 (1716-c. 1733); and the Wedding Chorals (Choralgesange, No. 89). With the exception that in the Cantatas he substitutes B for G as the first note of the last phrase of the tune (ut supra), Bach\u2019s text is invariable. The innovation is in Witt\u2019s text (No. 292). Having regard to Bach\u2019s invariable use elsewhere, it may be conjectured that the quaver B natural at the Edition: current; Page: [168] second beat of the final bar of the Orgelb\u00fcchlein Prelude belongs to the melody, and should be printed, 302431=N. xviii. 13 was the result of a revision of No. 17a, Edition: current; Page: [105] whose occasion Spitta suggests with plausibility. In the autumn of 1720 Bach visited Hamburg, where the post of Organist in the Church of St James was vacant. Johann Reinken, the veteran Organist of St Catherine\u2019s Church there, came to hear Bach play, and complimented him upon an improvisation, in the broad Bohm-Buxtehude manner, upon the melody \u201cAn Wasserfl\u00fcssen Babylon,\u201d a theme which Reinken himself had treated in a Prelude1. Spitta suggests2 that Bach revised the Hamburg improvisation (No. 17a) and sent Reinken No. 18. Having regard to Reinken\u2019s age and traditions it was natural that Bach should offer him a composition in the manner of B\u00f6hm (Reinken\u2019s pupil) and Buxtehude rather than in the new forms Bach was originating. While preserving the framework of No. 17a, Bach added a second Pedal part, an addition which entailed removing the cantus from the Tenor, where it lies in Nos. 17a and 17, to the Treble3., 881796=Luther\u2019s \u201cWir glauben all\u2019 an einen Gott,\u201d a free version of the Nicene Creed, was first published, with the melody (supra), in Johann Walther\u2019s Hymnbook (Wittenberg, 1524). The hymn was sung at the funeral of Luther\u2019s patron, Frederick the Wise of Saxony, in 1525, and was used as a funeral hymn in later times. During the Reformation it was generally sung after the sermon. The tune, no doubt, is derived from the plainsong of the Creed and was adapted by Walther. Bach uses it in the Organ works infra and Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 382. His text conforms closely to the original and Witt (No. 226)., 768896=The melody (supra) is first found in Gottfried Vopelius\u2019 Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch (Leipzig, 1682), where it is set to Keimann\u2019s hymn. It is one of fourteen new anonymous melodies in that work, in all probability by Vopelius himself, one of Bach\u2019s predecessors (d. 1715) as Cantor of St Nicolas\u2019 Church, Leipzig. His name is not attached to \u201cSei gegr\u00fcsset,\u201d perhaps because the first half of the tune is practically identical with a melody set to E. C. Edition: current; Page: [295] Homburg\u2019s \u201cGrossf\u00fcrst hoher Cherubinen,\u201d composed by Werner Fabricius and published in 1659. As Fabricius was a former Organist of St Nicolas\u2019 his tune must have been familiar to Vopelius. There is a four-part setting of Vopelius\u2019 melody in Choralges\u00e4nge, No. 307. Bach uses it elsewhere in the Organ works, where also his own is uniform with Witt\u2019s (No. 125) text, though he writes D for B as the penultimate note of bar 8 (supra)., 663813=P. v. 109 and N. xv. 101. The melody appears twice, among the Trinity hymns, in the Orgelbuchlein. It is the only tune introduced more than once into that work, and the significance of the fact has been pointed out in the Introduction to this volume. Making allowance for the free embellishments Bach introduces, the cantus exactly follows the reconstruction of 1687, excepting the last note of the first phrase of the tune, which is C natural intead of A. This improvement is found in Witt (No. 241), whose text Bach exactly follows. The two Orgelb\u00fcchlein movements differ in the smallest details, and the Novello Edition only prints the second of them; Bach distinguished it as \u201cdistinctius.\u201d The first movement, \u201cin Canone alla Quinta,\u201d is printed in the other Editions.}",
