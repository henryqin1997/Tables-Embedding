The Omnia II on Verizon was delayed about 7 months from European release, although we know that part of that delay was due to Verizon waiting so they could release it with Windows Mobile 6.5 out of the box, and not have to deal with messy ROM upgrades later on, which I'm sure could easily become a customer service nightmare (especially on a Windows Mobile device, which has no OTA update method to speak of). I'm looking for the Fascinate to come out late September, but if it is delayed until October, then it's highly likely that Verizon is waiting to release it with Froyo right out of the box, instead of burdening their network with a massive OTA update right after they release it (Froyo update for other Galaxy S phones is coming in late September). I know how messy upgrades can be, so if they can fully test an up to date Froyo ROM (and with working GPS) before releasing it to the public, then I say go for it. A quality product is worth waiting for., 62621=I am never wrong! Just kidding....Everything I read says early October, 104458=The rumored 10 MP HTC phone has been seen before, the Sabor for Sprint and the Discover Concept phone shown last August. I hope this is one of those two phones because they sound amazing, I might have to hold off to see if this rumor is true. But the Merge is almost for sure coming now that we have seen screen shots of it in the inventory system and now this., 103215=pre 2? omg global droid 2?omg htc merge?omfg fascinate?omg 2 tablets?omfg cant wait for september, 69388=woh you are kidding aren't you? Verizon has so many problems with their phones..I can't wait to switch from them. I agree with other person Samsung much better phone. I am switching to sprint 31 aug...Good by sorry Verizon, 45019=better graphics, better screen and many more things that comes the the samsung territory. Now by waiting till october when upgrades would be out on all carriers to 2.2. Who do you think would loose. I have seen the droid X and which to be is better than any other on verizon before fascinate comes out. Verizon have always been hard headed. I'm jumping ship if it doesn't come out next month. Just so you know It took Verizon 2years from when omnia 1 was released in Europe before they decided to let us have it., 40633=LTE Smartphones in the beginning of February, 29367=Rumor has it that some VW assocaites have been advised to gear for an \"iconic device\" to be launched on VW in January, 2011 where the activations will far exceed those for the DROID X...}",
