Generally though, winters (June to August) tend to be fairly cold and wet, with daytime temperatures ranging between 10 \u00b0C and 20 \u00b0C. Snowfall is rare, though there are snowfields in Victoria's high country which lies several hours outside north-east of Melbourne., 13369=The city was divided into two zones but since Jan 1st 2015 Zone 1 now covers both the central city, inner suburbs, middle and outer suburbs which is as far as many tourists would venture. Daily tickets costs from $7 respectively. The other change is the free Tram Zone within the Melbourne CBD and Victoria Market is now in place saving many tourists any cost at all., 28147=The Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) is one of the most famous cricket grounds in the world and hosts major cricket events as well as the AFL Grand Final. One key match is the Boxing Day Test Match, which runs from December 26-30, between the Australian national team and an international competitor., 2264=As of the 1st of July 2007, it is now prohibited to smoke in Victorian pubs.

It's published each year, covering hundreds of restaurants in the Melbourne CBD and throughout Victoria. The best quality restaurants are awarded hats. 3 hats is the maximum any restaurant can get and this is typically only reserved for a handful of restaurants. In the 2008 guide, only one restaurant managed to achieve the coveted 3 hats, Jacques Reymond., 25495=Summers (December to February) are hot and getting hotter, with days reaching maximum temperatures above 40 \u00b0C. While beaches are great during this time, summer is not a great time to visit other parts of Victoria, since the threat of bushfire can be high. Over the past few years, areas throughout northern, eastern and western Victoria have been devastated by bushfire., 26769=Melbourne has two teams playing in the A-league, Melbourne Victory and Melbourne Heart. Melbourne Victory is the larger of the two and has won the championship several times. Melbourne Heart is a more recent addition to the league. They both play from AAMI stadium, a brand new, architecturally stunning stadium located in the Melbourne Sports Precinct - near the MCG and Rod Laver Arena. The season runs between August and February., 28468=Aussie Rules football is an integral part of Melbourne and visitors who are lucky enough to be in town during the 'Footy' season are well-advised to catch a game.

Budget hotels can be found scattered throughout the city. Upper-class hotels are largely downtown or on the other side of the Yarra at Southbank.
