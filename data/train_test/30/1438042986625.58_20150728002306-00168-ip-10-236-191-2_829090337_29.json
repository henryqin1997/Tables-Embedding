It was better than pictured. The bathrooms are huge and beautiful. The view is not bad even though there is a hotel under construction next door. The furniture is comfortable and everything in the condo was like new condition! The resort was great with fantastic pools and landscaping! The weather was not so good but with free movies it was still",
