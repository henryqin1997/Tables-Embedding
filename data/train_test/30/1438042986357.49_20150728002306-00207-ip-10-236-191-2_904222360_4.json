            "This school is great for those who want a family-like community, but also want the ability to spread their wings and fly. Its great for those who are moving far away from family, or are not able to rely on family through-out college. THe college is highly self-sufficent and everything needed to survive is right there on campus. This college is also good for those who truly want experience. Unlike at big universities, experience is very easy to get. Countless oppurtunities are given and students are strongly encouraged to gain some experience. 80% of students intern or study abroad.",
            "Research the school. Take advantage of all the oppurtunities the school offers. Don't pass up on the 'big sis-lil sis' tradition. If you decide to go, make sure to fill out the form to recieve a big sis (aka, a junior level mentor).",
            "I will admit that the college is expensive. However, they do not waste your money. They put it to great use. From unlimited meal plans, tutoring, counseling, fitness center, library, pool, sports, activities, and more. THey spend your money on things for YOU.",
            "Its a beautiful and warm-hearted place. Many of the commuters I know, wished they chose to stay on campus because its just a big sisterhood full of things to do. The students clearly run the school, because the staff actually listen to what students want. Because of this, I have found Meredith more fit for a young student than any other college I visited.",
            "Before I write: I just wanted to say that I wrote a lot due to lack of student reviews on this college. When I was researching this school, I wish I had more student reviews. You will learn a lot at this school. This college does its best to help you succeed. The teachers care about you, they have free tutoring for full time students, and more. THe smaller class settings allow you to ask more questions, and the fact its all girls makes the classes a bit more chatty."

Corn Huskin' consists of immense student involvement in class skits, competitions, games, songs, and a final performance at the end of the week, to which family and friends are invited. This outrageous and thrilling tradition is a fantastic way to get connected with the peers in your class and participate in a little friendly competition. There is so much that goes on during the week of Corn Huskin' that is it difficult to recall all that happens. The summation of the week-long event is fun and interactive for everyone, whether in the audience or in the performances., 43608=I absolutely love the traditions. First there is Cornhuskin which is this big event that happens at the end of October and lasts a whole week. Basically it's a huge competition between the classes this year it was 2013 2014 2015 and 2016. It's so much fun to participate in and so amazing to watch everything come together over the weeks of practicing. Honestly you really just have to experience it. There is also Stunt which is like a field day for our school in the spring. They have a program called the big sis lil sis program where juniors become big sisters to freshman and help and guide them until they graduate. Most girls become best friend's with their big sis I know I have and a lot other girls have as well this one is my favorite tradition. Lastly there is the onyx ring tradition which is where students with 60 credits or more in the fall semester of their junior year get a ring with an onyx stone in the middle of it. This tradition is the big one for most students and they say this is when they really feel unified to the school., 154303=It amazing college; it has been ranked third on the 2013 edition of U.S. News & World Report list of the South\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?s Best Regional Colleges., 188861=Graduated in May 2014 with a BA in Psychology and Minor in Religious and Ethical Studies. Loved the Meredith experience! Student-Teacher ratio is great and the professors are willing to go above and beyond to help you succeed as long as you are diligent and motivated in your endeavor--planning to re-enter and finish my BA in religion!, 170020=Don't worry about not having guys! Some cross register classes at Meredith from local schools like NC State, Shaw, William Peace College and St. Aug. Meredith students can do the same depending on the course., 56360=my daughter is a graduate from 2002. i was so impressed with the atmosphere of the school that i transferred for the education and adventure of this college life.}",
