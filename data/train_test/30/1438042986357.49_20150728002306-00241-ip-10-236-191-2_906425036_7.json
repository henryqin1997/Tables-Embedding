I am never afraid to walk across campus at night alone no matter if it is 10 pm or 3:30 in the morning, this campus is always safe. I also never have to lock my doors because since you know pretty much everyone, you know if their is someone who shouldn't be on campus rather easily., 73944=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 2061=There is ALWAYS something going on and so much to be involved in. The very first weekend following Freshmen Orientation is full with events for the notorious CLASH of the CLASSES in which each class competes for braggin' rights. (In 2010-11, the freshman class dominated for the first time in school history.) It doesn't stop there, high profile entertainers - think Hawk Nelson, Tim Halperin, David Dunn and the like - are brought in on a regular basis to provide concerts FREE of charge. Concerts aren't the only outlet offered. An annual dance crew competition called NBDC (Northwestern's Best Dance Crew) brings in a professional crew from the real ABDC (America's Best Dance Crew) to act as judges for crews NW students put together. Shortly after NBDC, it's time for NCDC Extreme; the American Idol-esque competition that pits talented Northwestern vocalists against, rival and neighboring school, Dordt College. The prize? $500. Northwestern College sophomore, Nicole Northquest, walked away with the cash at this year's competition. If dances are your thing, don't worry, Ndub (the well-known and beloved nickname for Northwestern) has plenty of them. Impromptu dance parties occur nearly every night...ya' just gotta listen for the location and go! Organized dances are also held at Homecoming and Winter Formal. These events are well attended and an absolute blast to be a part of! Events quiet down for the fall semester following NCDC, but be ready to jump right back in the swing of things following Christmas Break for RUSH, a student led and produced dance production held annually. Everyone who auditions is cast, and experience levels range from beginner to Broadway performer. The Student Activities Council (SAC), headed by Lori Couch, does an excellent job in coming up with and promoting exciting events. It's rare for a student not to attend an event held by the SAC. Most of these are free of charge, but a few require a small fee; generally nothing more than $3. Many students find themselves way overbooked and having to scale back plans in order to complete their responsibilities. Events planned by the SAC are not the only social outlets available to students. A plethora of activities are scheduled within your wing and dorm. These events are also usually well attended. Campus ministries also offers numerous bible studies, outreach opportunities and other ways to give back to the community weekly.}",
