NDC 62856-603-01, 6\u00a0vials in a package., 52864=To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eisai Inc. at 1-888-274-2378 (by fax 1-201-746-3207) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch., 1330=Distributed by: Eisai Inc. Woodcliff Lake, NJ 07677 US License No. 1862, 51355=Revised: 7/2010, 13012=The safety and efficacy of Ontak were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-arm trial in patients with Stage\u00a0Ia to III CD25(+) CTCL. Eligible patients were required to have expression of CD25 on \u2265\u00a020% of biopsied malignant cells by immunohistochemistry [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Patients were randomized to receive 0, 9 or 18\u00a0mcg/kg/day Ontak via intravenous infusion days\u00a01-5 of each 21-day cycle, for up to 8\u00a0cycles. Randomization was stratified by disease stage (\u2264IIa vs. \u2265IIb). The main efficacy outcome was objective response rate (ORR), using a Weighted Skin Severity Index, in conjunction with assessment of lymph node involvement and percentage of abnormal blood lymphocytes. A total of 144\u00a0patients were randomized: 44\u00a0patients to placebo, 45\u00a0patients to 9\u00a0mcg/kg/day Ontak and 55\u00a0patients to 18\u00a0mcg/kg/day Ontak. Randomization for the study was carried out at 1:1:1 for the first 73\u00a0patients, 4:1:4 for the next 31\u00a0patients, and 1:4:4 for the remaining 40\u00a0patients. The median age of patients was 59\u00a0years (range 23 to 84\u00a0years); 34% were \u2265\u00a065\u00a0years. Fifty-five percent were men and 86% were Caucasian. Sixty-seven percent had early stage disease (\u2264\u00a0IIa). Patients had received a median of 2\u00a0anti-CTCL therapies (range 0 to 6) prior to study entry. Results for objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) are shown in the table below.}",
