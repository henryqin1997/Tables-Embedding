    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{370535=The Company\u0092s franchise segment represented 5.6% and 3.7% of total net sales for first thirteen weeks of 2012 and 2011, respectively and 4.7% and 4.0% of total net sales for the first thirty-nine weeks of 2012 and 2011, respectively. The franchise segment sells franchises to operate Caribou Coffee brand coffeehouses to domestic and international franchisees. As of September\u00a030, 2012, there were 202 franchised coffeehouses in U.S and international markets. The openings and closings of franchise-owned coffeehouses for the periods presented were as follows:, 150273=Balance, January\u00a01, 2012, 489474=Our sales are somewhat seasonal, with the fourth quarter accounting for the highest sales volumes. Operating results for the thirteen week period ended September\u00a030, 2012 are not necessarily indicative of future results that may be expected for the year ending December\u00a030, 2012., 686292=Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our management reviews financial information for decision making purposes. We have three reportable operating segments: retail, commercial and franchise. \u0093Unallocated corporate\u0094 includes expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. The following tables summarize our results of operations by segment for the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2012 and 2011., 682718=Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased $0.9 million, or 10.2%, to $7.5 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2012, from $8.4 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2011. This decrease is due to a lower depreciable asset base from reduced capital spending in recent fiscal years., 284303=Purchases under the Company\u0092s stock purchase programs may be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market. As of September\u00a030, 2012, there is $1.0 million remaining for future stock repurchases under the Company\u0092s stock purchase program., 680039=Net sales increased $4.9 million, or 2.1%, to $238.9 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2012 from $234.0 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2011. Coffeehouse net sales increased $6.4 million, or 3.7%, to $182.8 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2012 from $176.3 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2011. Commercial and franchise sales decreased by $1.5 million, or 2.6%, to $56.1 million for the first thirty-nine weeks of 2012 from $57.6 million for the first thirty-nine weeks of 2011. Commercial segment sales decreased by $3.4 million, or 7.0%, due to lower green coffee sales and royalties related to Caribou Coffee K-cups, partially offset by increased sales of packaged coffee to our grocery, mass merchant and club store customers and increased sales to our foodservice customers. Franchise sales grew by $1.9 million or 19.8% primarily due to new franchise and license locations., 349612=In November 2004, the Company entered into a Master Franchise Agreement with a franchisee. The agreement provides the franchisee the right to develop, subfranchise or operate 250 Caribou Coffee coffeehouses in 12 Middle Eastern countries. In June of 2011, the Master Franchise Agreement was amended to expand the rights of the franchisee to develop 350 Caribou Coffee coffeehouses and to extend the expiration date. The agreement, as amended, expires in December 2021., 683177=General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased $0.7 million, or 2.9%, to $23.0 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2012, from $23.7 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2011. As a percentage of total net sales, general and administrative expenses was 9.6% in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2012, compared to 10.1% in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2011. This decrease is due to lower performance based compensation through the first thirty-nine weeks of 2012., 274720=Derivative assets consist of commodity futures contracts. The amounts in the table above represent the gross fair value of the derivative liability. The Company nets the derivative assets and liabilities in the hedging program, including cash collateral, when a master netting arrangement exists between the Company and the counterparty to the derivative contract. The amount or timing of cash collateral balances may impact the classification of the derivative in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The gross fair value of the commodity contracts in the table above is exclusive of cash collateral receivable of $0.2 million as of September\u00a030, 2012 and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The Company uses quoted prices in an active market for identical derivative assets and liabilities that are traded in exchanges. These derivative liabilities are included in Level 1., 236211=In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.\u00a02011-06, Comprehensive Income (Topic 820). This accounting standard update eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity and requires the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. It also requires presentation on the face of the financial statements of reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statements where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented. This accounting standard update became effective beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2012. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No.\u00a02011-12 which indefinitely defers the guidance related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments only. The adoption of this accounting standard update resulted in financial statement presentation changes only., 859196=Date: November\u00a09, 2012, 708093=The retail segment operates company-owned coffeehouses. As of September\u00a030, 2012, there were 408 company-owned coffeehouses in 16 states and the District of Columbia., 781983=Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including the pace of our expansion, real estate markets, the availability of suitable site locations and the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords for new coffeehouses as well as lease termination costs associated with existing underperforming coffeehouse leases. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2012 to be in the range of $13 to $14 million. We believe that our current liquidity and cash flow from operations will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for at least 12\u00a0months., 783660=In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.\u00a02011-06, Comprehensive Income (Topic 820). This accounting standard update eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity and requires the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. It also requires presentation on the face of the financial statements of reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statements where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented. This accounting standard update became effective beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2012. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No.\u00a02011-12 which indefinitely defers the guidance related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments only. The adoption of this accounting standard update resulted in financial statement presentation changes only., 303417=Outstanding, September\u00a030, 2012, 254704=The following table presents the financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September\u00a030, 2012 (in thousands):, 613852=Sales increased $1.3 million, or 45.0%, to $4.3 million in the third thirteen weeks of 2012, from $3.0 million in the third thirteen weeks of 2011 primarily due to higher product sales and royalties from 202 franchise locations, a net increase of 52 locations from the prior year., 681233=Cost of sales and related occupancy costs. Cost of sales and related occupancy costs increased $6.0 million, or 5.3%, to $119.1 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2012, from $113.1 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2011, primarily due to higher sales and higher coffee commodity costs. As a percentage of total net sales, cost of sales and related occupancy costs increased to 49.8% in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2012 from 48.3% in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2011. This increase as a percentage of sales was due to higher coffee commodity costs on a year over year basis., 544468=General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $0.4 million, or 5.1%, to $8.2 million in the third thirteen weeks of 2012, from $7.8 million in the third thirteen weeks of 2011. As a percentage of total net sales, general and administrative expenses was 10.6% in the third thirteen weeks of 2012, compared to 9.5% in the third thirteen weeks of 2011. This increase is due deleveraging on lower green coffee sales and royalties related to Caribou K-cups., 732016=Sales decreased $3.4 million, or 7.0%, to $44.9 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2012, from $48.2 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2011. This decrease is primarily based on lower green coffee sales and royalties related to Caribou Coffee K-cups, partially offset by increased sales of packaged coffee to our grocery, mass merchant and club store customers and increased sales to our foodservice customers., 710839=Depreciation and amortization.\u00a0Depreciation and amortization decreased $0.8\u00a0million, or 10.1%, to $7.4\u00a0million for the first thirty-nine weeks of 2012, from $8.3\u00a0million for the first thirty-nine weeks of 2011. Depreciation and amortization was lower in the quarter due to a lower depreciable asset base., 732724=Cost of sales and related occupancy costs. Cost of sales and related occupancy costs increased $0.8\u00a0million, or 2.5%, to $33.5\u00a0million for the first thirty-nine weeks of 2012, from $32.7\u00a0million for the first thirty-nine weeks of 2011. On a dollar basis, this increase in cost of sales was primarily related to higher year over year coffee commodity costs. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales and related occupancy costs increased to 74.7% for the first thirty-nine weeks of 2012, from 67.8% for the first thirty-nine weeks of 2011. This increase in cost of sales and related occupancy costs as a percentage of sales was due to higher coffee commodity costs., 781458=Net cash used by financing activities for the first thirty-nine weeks of 2012 was $8.3 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1.2 million for the first thirty-nine weeks of 2011. In this first thirty-nine weeks of 2012, we repurchased 0.8\u00a0million shares of our common stock at a total price of $8.9 million, or an average price per share of $11.75 per share., 628996=Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended September\u00a030, 2012 vs. Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended October\u00a02, 2011, 543160=Operating expenses. Operating expenses increased $0.3 million, or 1.0%, to $26.6 million in the third thirteen weeks of 2012, from $26.3 million in the third thirteen weeks of 2011. On a dollar basis, this increase was primarily driven by increased marketing investments and higher fees for debit card transactions, partially offset by lower labor and maintenance costs in our retail segment. Operating expenses as a percentage of total net sales increased to 34.4% in the third thirteen weeks of 2012 from 32.3% in the third thirteen weeks of 2011 due to deleveraging on lower green coffee sales and royalties related to Caribou K-cups which have lower operating expenses associated with those sales., 328792=Prior to fiscal year 2011, a valuation allowance was recorded against our deferred tax assets as we determined the realization of these assets did not meet the more likely than not criteria. During the first thirteen weeks of 2011, we determined that a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets was not necessary and recorded a partial reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance of $21.4 million. We considered the available positive and negative evidence, including our recent earnings trend and expected continued future taxable income including the following discrete events: (1)\u00a0our attainment of three years of cumulative income and (2)\u00a0the finalization of our current year and long range financial plan which projects sufficient future taxable income. As of September\u00a030, 2012, there is no valuation allowance for our gross deferred tax assets., 540746=Net sales decreased $4.2 million, or 5.2%, to $77.2 million in the third thirteen weeks of 2012 from $81.4 million in the third thirteen weeks of 2011. Coffeehouse net sales increased $2.3 million, or 4.0%, to $61.0 million in the third thirteen weeks of 2012 from $58.7 million in the third thirteen weeks of 2011. Commercial and franchise sales decreased by $6.5 million, or 28.7%, to $16.2 million for the third thirteen weeks of 2012 from $22.7 million for the third thirteen weeks of 2011. Commercial segment sales decreased by $7.9 million or 39.9% based on lower green coffee sales and royalties related to Caribou Coffee K-cups, partially offset by increased sales of packaged coffee to our grocery, mass merchant and club store customers and increased sales to our foodservice customers. Franchise sales grew by $1.3 million or 45.0% primarily due to new franchise and license locations., 615213=due primarily to our increase in product sales to our franchise partners. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales and related occupancy costs increased to 60.0% for the third thirteen weeks of 2012, from 58.4% for the third thirteen weeks of 2011. This increase in cost of sales and related occupancy costs as a percentage of sales was due to sales mix changes with product sales driving a slightly higher proportion of sales versus royalties and franchise fees., 614417=Cost of sales and related occupancy costs. Cost of sales and related occupancy costs increased $0.9 million, or 48.9%, to $2.6\u00a0million for the third thirteen weeks of 2012, from $1.7\u00a0million for the third thirteen weeks of 2011, 753903=Sales increased $1.9 million, or 19.8%, to $11.3 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2012, from $9.4 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2011 primarily due to higher product sales and royalties from 202 franchise locations, a net increase of 52 locations from the prior year., 408704=Thirteen weeks ended October\u00a02, 2011, 571431=General and administrative expenses.\u00a0General and administrative expenses decreased $0.2 million, or 8.5%, to $2.1 million for the third thirteen weeks of 2012, from $2.3 million for the third thirteen weeks of 2011. This decrease is due to lower performance based compensation through the third thirteen weeks of 2012., 308284=Our stock options were issued with an exercise price equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. The weighted average fair value of our options granted during the thirty-nine week period ended September\u00a030, 2012 was $8.97 per share. We estimated the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, modified for dividends and using the following assumptions:, 132630=Common stock, par value $.01, 200,000 shares authorized; 20,334 and 20,848 shares issued and outstanding at September\u00a030, 2012 and January\u00a01, 2012, respectively, 568127=The retail segment operates company-owned coffeehouses. As of September\u00a030, 2012, there were 408 company-owned coffeehouses in 16 states and the District of Columbia., 849669=There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in the \u0093Risk Factors\u0094 section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January\u00a01, 2012., 628366=General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $0.6 million, or 11.0%, to $6.0 million for the third thirteen weeks of 2012 from $5.4 million for the third thirteen weeks of 2011. As a percentage of total net sales, general and administrative expenses increased to 7.8% in the third thirteen weeks of 2012, from 6.7% in the third thirteen weeks of 2011. This increase was due to higher support center personnel costs to support our company initiatives., 294196=Outstanding, April\u00a01, 2012, 782893=Other than our coffeehouse leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. As of September\u00a030, 2012, we were committed to fixed and price-to-be-fixed green coffee purchase contracts with deliveries expected through August 2014. We only contract for green coffee expected to be used in the normal course of business. We believe, based on relationships established with our suppliers in the past, the risk of non-delivery on such purchase commitments is remote., 305639=Options vested at September\u00a030, 2012, 780424=Net cash provided by operating activities for the first thirty-nine weeks of 2012 was $0.7 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $24.0 million for the first thirty-nine weeks of 2011. This $23.3 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities was the result of higher working capital needs, particularly related to inventory and the increase in coffee commodity costs., 8704=Indicate by check mark whether the registrant (1)\u00a0has filed all reports required to be filed by Section\u00a013 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that the registrant was required to file such reports), and (2)\u00a0has been subject to such filing requirements for the past 90 days.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes\u00a0\u00a0x\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No\u00a0\u00a0\u00a8, 730877=The commercial segment sells high-quality premium whole bean and ground coffee to grocery stores, mass merchandisers, club stores, office coffee and foodservice providers, hotels, entertainment venues and on-line customers. In addition, we sell our blended coffees and license our brand to Green Mountain Coffee Roasters for sale and use in its K-Cup single serve line of business. Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, an industry leader in single cup brewing technology, facilitates the sale and distribution of Caribou K-Cups. Caribou Coffee K-Cups represent an important portion of our commercial business. As of September\u00a030, 2012, Caribou Coffee can be found in over 40\u00a0states and in approximately 9,000 stores through our Caribou-managed sales channel. Caribou Coffee K-Cups are found in, we believe, an additional 17,000 stores across all 50\u00a0states., 353464=Unamortized deferred financing fees capitalized on the balance sheet totaled $0.1 million as of September\u00a030, 2012 and January\u00a01, 2012., 245719=The following table presents the pretax effect of derivative instruments on the consolidated financial statements for the thirty-nine weeks ended September\u00a030, 2012 and October\u00a02, 2011 (in thousands):, 780964=Net cash used in investing activities for the first thirty-nine weeks of 2012 was $8.4 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $6.7 million for the first thirty-nine weeks of 2011. This slight increase in investing activities is due to equipment purchases in the current period to support our retail launches such as carbonated beverages., 352118=The Company maintains a credit agreement with US Bank, National Association (the \u0093Bank\u0094). The credit agreement provides for a $25 million revolving line of credit, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes, including funding working capital, capital expenditures and other needs. The line of credit has a maturity date of October\u00a031, 2016., 3235=For the quarterly period ended September\u00a030, 2012., 847008=We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and the operations of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u0093Exchange Act\u0094). Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective, as of September\u00a030, 2012, in ensuring that material information relating to us required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2012, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting., 615794=Operating expenses.\u00a0Operating expenses increased $0.2 million, or 63.3%, to $0.5 million in the third thirteen weeks of 2012, from $0.3 million in the third thirteen weeks of 2011. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses increased to 11.2% in the third thirteen weeks of 2012 from 9.9% in the third thirteen weeks of 2011. This increase is primarily related to higher labor costs to support our growing franchise business., 545099=Interest expense. Interest expense remained relatively flat at less than $0.1 million for both the third thirteen weeks of 2012 and 2011. We had no outstanding borrowings during the third thirteen weeks of 2012 or 2011., 264845=The following table presents the financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of January\u00a01, 2012 (in thousands):, 8251=Registrant\u0092s Telephone Number, Including Area Code: (763)\u00a0592-2200, 351022=As of September\u00a030, 2012 and January\u00a01, 2012, the Company included $1.7 million of the deposit in long term liabilities as deferred revenue and $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively in current liabilities as deferred revenue on its balance sheet. The initial deposit will be amortized into income on a pro rata basis along with the initial franchise fee payments received in connection with the execution of the franchise or subfranchise agreements at the time of the coffeehouse opening. The current portion of deferred revenue represents the franchise fees for the coffeehouses estimated to be opened during the subsequent twelve months per the development schedule in the Master Franchise Agreement. At September\u00a030, 2012, there were 102 coffeehouses operating under this Agreement., 708537=Coffeehouse sales increased $6.4 million, or 3.7%, to $182.8 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2012 from $176.3 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2011. This increase is attributable to a 2.9% increase in comparable coffeehouse sales in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011. The increase in comparable coffeehouse sales was primarily driven by increased traffic and a change in the mix of beverage sales., 786235=The following table sets forth non-GAAP metrics and operating data that do not otherwise appear in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the thirteen weeks and twenty-six weeks ended September\u00a030, 2012 and October\u00a02, 2011:, 239989=The Company had no derivatives not designated as hedging instruments as of September\u00a030, 2012 and January\u00a01, 2012., 779688=Cash and cash equivalents as of September\u00a030, 2012 were $28.6 million, compared to cash and cash equivalents of $44.5 million as of January\u00a01, 2012. Generally, our principal requirements for cash are capital expenditures and funding operations. Capital expenditures include maintenance and remodeling of existing coffeehouses, general and administrative expenditures for items like management information systems and costs for expanding production capacity to meet the growth demands of our business. Currently our requirements for capital have been funded through cash flow from operations., 284914=The Company maintains stock compensation plans, which provide for the granting of non-qualified stock options and restricted stock to officers and key employees and certain non-employees. Stock options have been granted at prices equal to the fair market values as of the dates of grant. Options and restricted stock generally vest over four years and options generally expire ten years from the grant date. Upon exercise of an option, new shares of stock are issued by the Company. Stock-based compensation expense for the thirteen weeks ended September\u00a030, 2012 and October\u00a02, 2011 was approximately $0.5 million in both periods and is included in general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Stock-based compensation expense for the thirty-nine weeks ended September\u00a030, 2012 and October\u00a02, 2011 was approximately $1.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively., 298799=Outstanding, July\u00a01, 2012, 288377=Outstanding, January\u00a01, 2012, 593896=Operating expenses. Operating expenses decreased $0.3 million, or 23.7%, to $1.2 million for the third thirteen weeks of 2012, from $1.5 million for the third thirteen weeks of 2011 due to lower labor costs from open positions. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses increased to 9.8% in the third thirteen weeks of 2012 from 7.7% in the third thirteen weeks of 2011.
