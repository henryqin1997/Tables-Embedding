My attitude has undoubtedly softened since I witnessed a horrific dogfight. In the wife`s defence, the barmaid should never have called last orders. Manchester City need a result at Middlesbrough to avoid being dragged into a real scrap at the wrong end of the table. The Boro do have one eye on Monday`s FA Cup replay; I`m considering getting involved with another psycho at 10/3. I feel a real connection with the animal loving McCartney clan. I could never understand why Stella appeared unhappy with Heather; I`d have thought the prospect of a decent burger for dinner would have been a relief. I guess the waiting time proved an annoyance. There`s nothing annoying about the 11/10 for a Reading win over Portsmouth. Roman Abramovich is another high profile figure to have recently split from his other half. I imagine Roman`s wife won`t be too upset though, she`s in line for a massive payout; although Frank Lampard has denied being a part of any deal. The future of Lampard and Terry is under a cloud thanks to a proposed salary cap. Chelsea are considering introducing a \u00a3120,000 a week ceiling; I think the builder`s ripping them off. Chelsea will demolish Sheffield United at 1/5. Call me an overly optimistic, frustrated ornithologist, but I wish that all birds were as easy to get on their backs as the Robben. A 3-0 Chelsea win should be dived on at a more punter friendly 7/1. I was delighted to hear the news that Michael Owen is up and running again. Only Michael and his local bookmaker were more excited. I`m quite literally beside myself with the 6/4 for a Charlton win over Newcastle. Fulham may have a fantastic record at the Cottage, but they get stopped more than Pete Doherty on the road. Wigan have the three points in the bag at 5/4. Arsenal have appeared to have based their style of play on me. It`s pretty to look at, but there`s a real lack of penetration. If forced, I`d suggest a win for the Gunners at Goodison Park, but the skinny odds of 5/4 are a little bit like Scotland, you`re better off keeping out of it. The wife had to meet up with the doctor last night, Martens, I think his name was. Backing the Villa to draw with Liverpool at 12/5 will cover the cost of a big bottle of Lucozade; I`ve got a raging thirst. I must express my sense of disappointment with Anton Ferdinand. The manager was never going to believe he was visiting his grandma; only Wayne Rooney can sell that line without arousing suspicion. I`m putting my cash down on Blackburn to beat West Ham at 8/11. Rooney may well be partnered by overrated midfielder / overrated forward Alan Smith for the visit of Bolton, but United can still be backed with real confidence at 1/3. Ronaldo looks a great shout to open the scoring at 11/2. The procumbent winger is second only to Drogba in the race for the golden boot; that`s half decent for a lad who only plays a tiny proportion of the game in an upright position. Here`s an adage for Martin Jol. 'You can`t catch fire if you throw away matches`. Spurs would definitely have seen off Chelsea if Lennon and Berbatov weren`t sacrificed to appease the God of 'bus-parking`. Jol can make amends by sending out a decent team to beat Watford at 1/2. The weekend accer is so thought provoking; i`m actually considering turning into a vegetarian. Of course that`s dependent on finding a morally loose non-meat eater with exceptionally low standards. Reading, Spurs, Wigan, Blackburn and Charlton are the selections, the payout is a beefy 26/1.
