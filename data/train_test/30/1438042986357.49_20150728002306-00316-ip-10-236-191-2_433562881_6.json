He was promoted to open in Tests, though it's a role he hasn't handled successfully so far. In the 2011 World Cup in the subcontinent, he was New Zealand's second-highest run-scorer, with 262 runs at 43.66. He signed with English county side Derbyshire for the 2011 season, scoring 278 runs in five games at 69.50 with two tons in the Clydesdale Bank 40, and 537 runs in eight Championship Division Two matches. A run of failures led to questions over his Test place but a dazzling T20 101 not out against South Africa in East London made him part of a select band to have scored international hundreds in all three formats., 49818=Jun 30, 2015, 51521=Jun 20, 2015, 67305=4391 runs after 35, and 2354 outside top five, 63035=The Cricket Monthly: The IPL lasts two months, but through the year talent hunters are scouring India (and the internet) for the next big thing.
