Nursing homes Because of the limited evidence for the eight antipsychotic medications evaluated and the complexities of treating the disorders, we have not chosen a Best Buy in this special analysis. Our medical advisers recommend that you discuss with your doctor first trying standard treatment options, including nondrug strategies if appropriate and medications that are FDA-approved for your condition. Carefully consider an antipsychotic drug only if those other options fail to improve your symptoms. Some of the possible side effects can be serious, and include: muscle rigidity, slow movement and involuntary tremors (known as extrapyramidal symptoms, some of which can be permanent), substantial weight gain, an increased",
    "textAfterTable": "If you do decide to try an antipsychotic drug, carefully weigh the risks of the medication against the potential benefits, if any. Your doctor should monitor you for side effects. This includes assessing your weight, checking your muscles to make sure they are functioning well, and performing blood tests. If your symptoms don\u2019t improve, you should stop taking the medication. Cost might also be an important factor to take into account. Most of these antipsychotic drugs are expensive, so if you and your doctor decide that you should start taking one, find out how much of the price your insurance plan covers and how much you will have to pay out-of-pocket. Another important issue to consider is that it is not clear from the available studies what dosage is correct for a person to take for the various off-label uses. We are unable to make any recommendation about how much a person should take, so you should discuss this with your physician. In some cases, a lower dose than is typically used to treat FDA-approved indications, such as schizophrenia, might be adequate for an off-label use.
