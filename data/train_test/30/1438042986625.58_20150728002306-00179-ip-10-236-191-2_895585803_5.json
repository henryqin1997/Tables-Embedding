            "Great for students that are self-motivated, enjoy the outdoors, and enjoy living in a place where everyone is thankful and appreciative for the opportunity to attend such prestigious institutions.",
            "1) Visit the school while school is in session. This will give you a realistic feel for how you would fit in at CSB/SJU. It will give you an opportunity to see how incredible the campus looks and feels, and show you how close this community really is. 2) Talk to a financial aid officer. This will help decide/understand how you can pay for this extraordinary education. They will help make it happen, as I am living proof of that.",
            "If you are applying for these institutions, you obviously are aware of how expensive it is. However, I know from personal experience, if you have a decent GPA, are involved at your high school, and participate in extra-curricular activities, CSB/SJU will reward you. They are well known for being extremely generous with scholarships, and are willing to help any student that is in need. Also, students that graduate from CSB/SJU are GUARANTEED a job after graduation. That is a guarantee most schools dream of making. This school really does make you feel like they are spending every extra dollar on improving the quality of student life, which makes these schools that much better.",
            "I love the sense of community that resides here at CSB/SJU. When you're a student here, you are not just one of 4,000 students; you are part of a community that watches out for each other, and always puts others first. It truly is a one-of-a-kind college.",
            "The professors at these institutions apply the material to everyday situations which makes the material that much more interesting."

I am a student worker with the Residential Life department and we are always available at the office to answer any questions, either over the phone, email or in person. CSB/SJU offers amazing living situations and currently is building beautiful new town homes which will be open Fall of 2012. There is plenty of housing for every student and many options of living., 116757=The only club I was involved with this past year was the Climbing Club. I also volunteered as a Student Ambassador. There are plenty of things to get involved with, though, if you want to do that. There is a fair around October in the athletic center where every club can set up a table to advertise what they do. Students are free to browse the tables and sign up for whatever they would like to participate in.}",
