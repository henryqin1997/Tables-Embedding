    "textBeforeTable": "Referenced by Having described the present invention, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that many changes in construction and circuitry and widely differing embodiments and applications of the invention will suggest themselves without departing from the scope of the present invention. In order to facilitate manual gripping of Release Tool 70, Elongated Handle 72 is provided with a Rounded Portion 81 along one edge, and Lever Arm 76 is provided with a Rounded Portion 82 along one edge which will move into engagement with an edge of Elongated Handle 72 when Lever Arm 76 is squeezed to force Blade Edge 80 into engagement with the breakaway portion of Battery Clip 62. . Release Tool 70 is made up of an Elongated Handle 72 having a Stationary Arm 74 extending from one end of said arm and at right angles thereto. A tang-engaging Lever Arm 76 is pivotally connected to an intermediate portion of Elongated Handle 72 and has a Blade Member 78 with a Blade Edge 80 at its free end. Lever Arm 76 is pivotally connected to Elongated Handle 72 at a location such that when Stationary Arm 74 bears against Flexible Boot 32, Blade Edge 80 is pivoted into engagement with the molded breakaway portion of Battery Clip 62. Blade Edge 80 is movable to bear against Tangs 68 so as to release them",
