MON: 12:45 p.m. TUE: 2:30 p.m. WED: 4:30 p.m. THU: 2:30 p.m. FRI: 5:30 p.m. SAT: 10:30 a.m. *All times Eastern. You can also listen to the station on 94.3 FM, 92.7 FM and online at ESPN980.com. Click here for past audio clips., 122831=11:40, a long conga line of straw men there. I'm not even going to bother., 95078=There may also be some \"monikered\" posters who use Anon when they want to slam Mark or someone else but not \"own\" it. Section 3, My PFB Sofa said\u2026 @George, FWIW, I think there are at least 3 or 4 distinct regular trolls who post as anonymous. They could post with their SSN and an image of their birthmark, and they'd still be here just to be antisocial, but the point is, there is more than one. April 16, 2012 9:40 AM, 38988=May 15 is far too early to determine who is a true contender \u2013 the wheat and chaff don't get separated until,as Ken Beatrice used to say, \"come the dog days\" of July and August. I'd say Aug 1 \u2013 15 is the real cutoff for this. In the end, to quote Beatrice again, \"talent will out\" but especially in baseball, it takes a long time to see. Relax. Enjoy this team. Be patient. Judge slowly, no, even more slowly than that., 60218=I have it on good authority that Bryce Harper will be playing 2 out of 3 games in center field. He is better in right, still adjusting to center but improving especially when it comes to feeding the cut-off man. He is starting to adjust to advanced left-handed pitching he has begun to see regularly both in AA and now in AAA. He is not overmatched and is improving. Tyler Moore and Corey Brown have had very good starts to the year. Both are showing more mature plate discipline which is allowing them to see better pitches. Teahen has been extremely good so far.IMO I wouldn't rush Harper to get up in June. I'd wait until after the All Star or even September. But, of course that's up to him. Everyone is just going to have to be patient., 49114=Anon @10:40, if they could make a quick overturn like the play at 1st where the umps aren't going under the hood, then that is great.Here's why that call was so large in scope, the Nats are in the hunt and that play in hindsight appears to have cost the Nats a \"W\"., 153252=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC. Images provided by Getty Images. Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 30582=For the statsheads said\u2026 Has Ramos hit anything in the air yet this season? Seems like everything is on the ground. April 15, 2012 8:02 PM ___________________________Ramos crushed a double to CF that was a line drive. He smashed that ball to end the game that was snagged by Votto. I guess same could be said for Ryan Zimmerman and Danny Espinosa.The good news is Werth, LaRoche, and Desmond are picking these guys up.When Zim, Espi and Ramos get rolling, this team will be scoring a lot more runs.I see LF and CF as dead spots as nobody in those spots are doing much of anything and none of them really have recent histories of sustained offensive numbers (Ankiel, Bernadina, DeRosa, Nady).Might be time to give Bernadina and Lombo a shot in LF., 65458=Anon@6:32 I think he might have. DeRosa did not have a good jump on the ball and he seems to be a lot slower than Bernie. I sit on the LF side, and I thought he had a good chance for it, but he got there late and timed his leap wrong. Watching the replay, I thought FP and Carp were generous in saying he had \"no shot, it went over his head.\"This is the second time I saw DeRosa miss what I thought was a catchable ball. People are worried about his wrist and his hitting, and I know he's a righty so that's why he was playing LF, but not sure that's working. We have that big outfield, Clip's a flyball pitcher\u2013need fast outfielders. (Bernie, however, had already PH, and done a good job at it.), 40046=In 1967, just a young child who loved the game, and thought Hondo was Superman, next to my folks of course who will be my real heros, 80413=Would miss Clipp terribly, but I agree with posters who say he should go on the DL. If he says this is \"normal\" for him but taking longer into the season than usual, let him have a couple weeks off while we are playing Houston, Miami, the Padres and the Dodgers. Stros and Pads are what they are, Miami's got trouble and the Dodgers (I think) are overperforming. We should be able to beat up on those teams with the rest of the bullpen.Rizzo doesn't have to make the decision today. If Clipp doesn't pitch tonight or tomorrow night while they assess the shoulder Rizzo can backdate the DL to April 15, and Clip would be back for the D-Backs series., 34834=Manassas nats' Fan, yep, that's my point. Those 3 are carrying the rest. Its only 10 games into the season and May 15th really sets the mark at the 1/4 pole to see who's real and who isn't.I think Adam LaRoche is going to have a career year based on his fast start and will only look better when Morse is back in the lineup.Werth is getting on base and hoping he is no fluke and getting back to what Rizzo paid for.Desmond looks very comfortable his 2nd and 3rd times through the order. Seeing a lot more pitches., 38295=I have waited since 1967 for this in DC\u2026 better late than never!}",
