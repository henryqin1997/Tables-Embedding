The rodeo in May is the longest running continuous rodeo in the United States. There's a multi-plex movie theater and quite a few restaurants and of course the casino. We're a couple hours from the skiing in Flagstaff or the adventure of the Grand Canyon or the breath-taking scenery of Sedona.

            "The College offers the convenience of both online and on campus classes. The on campus class sizes are small (there are 11 of us in my CNA class) which makes for a great learning environment and fun discussions. The dedicated teachers are interested in the students' progress and are available by phone and email. All credits are directly transferable to any of the universities in Arizona so the standards are very high. The town of Payson where Gila County Community College is located, is barely 13,000 people so it's a friendly place with a small town atmosphere."

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Overall, it is a wonderful school! If you are nervous about jumping in to a huge university, EAC is a worthwhile alternative. It has smaller class sizes with helpful teachers, students, and staff. Tips for prospective students If you get involved with the activities happening around campus, you will meet so many people who are similar to you. I guarantee that you will make lasting friendships! The people there are awesome! Bang for the buck There are so many scholarships available to students who take the time to look. The staff is very supportive and helpful and there are plenty of resources around campus that can help steer you in the right direction. Did enjoy being here It's a beautiful small town with strong unity among the community. It is a very positive environment with a variety of people from different cultures, backgrounds, and lifestyles. If you live there, you are like family. Did learn a lot It's a junior college, but you are still expected to work hard and learn the material. You definitely get out what you put in.",
