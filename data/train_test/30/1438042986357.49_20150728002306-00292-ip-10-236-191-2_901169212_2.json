Let\u2019s take a look at the pitches thrown at Dunn on 0-0 counts. Unfortunately for Dunn, I don\u2019t think we can order opposing pitchers what to throw. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not my game,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cEverything is there except me swinging at bad pitches,\u201d Dunn continued. \u201cI\u2019m working the count, usually putting myself in usually good hitters\u2019 counts but not making them pay.\u201d Dunn believes his recent struggles stem from being too aggressive and that opposing pitchers are taking advantage by throwing off-speed pitches early in the count.
