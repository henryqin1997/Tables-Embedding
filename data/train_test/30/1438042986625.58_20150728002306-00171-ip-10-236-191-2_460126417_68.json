In essence, you can take Associations that emulate existing base classes, and add other (usually stronger) features on top of it. Various suggestions on how to recreate certain base classes are listed below: your unique character. The Trissociate tries to get around these restrictions by breaking down the various iconic base classes, into fragments of their class features. It also converts various common monster archetypes into abilities that scales as you level. Ultimately, it lets you pick and choose these various components to create a mix that suits While it is possible to construct such characters, blending multiple classes which do not have dual progression PrC or feat support tends to give suboptimal results. Similiarly, using high LA monster races or templates usually sucks up so many levels that the character has a hard time being viable. And both cannot be done at low levels.

This makes Associations that provide Energy Resistance more compatible with each other. (So you could blend together a Half-Farspawn/Half-Fiend without worrying about overlapping Energy Resistance). -Similiarly, Shadow Cold Resistance reworded to Chosen Energy Resistance with just 1 choice, to allow it to stack with other Chosen Energy Resustance. -Added an Adaptation note to Animal Companion to allow its possible use with other creatures. -Celesial and Farspawn Energy Resistance expanded to cover the 4 basic elements (Fire, Cold, Electricity, Acid) -Renamed Marshal to Marshal Aura association. -Added name of Association to Recover Spell and SLA talents, so that it is clear which association the talent applies to. -Elemental Strike given some equipment support by allowing warlock gear to apply to it. 2 Jul 12 -Added Cirno sample. 9 Jul 12 -Addded Erudite, Wu Jen and Shugenja associations. 1 Aug 12 -Added Half-Molydeus 16 Jan 13 -Half-Undead Damage Reduction is now Silver and Magic -Added Half-Alu-Demon -Some tweaks to the EZ-Trissociate program to include text on Proficiencies and Focus Features, as well general Trissocate Text at the end.
