The matrix transposer 1307 both complex conjugates and transposes the row vector from the block 1313 into a column vector of complex conjugates. The multiplier 1305 then multiplies these column and row vectors to form the two-by-two matrix R. The matrix R is the accumulation of the products generated by the multiplier 1305 for the current batch (i.e., for each bin, the product generated by the multiplier 1305 is added to the previous values of the matrix R generated from the data of the current batch). The elements of the matrix R for the j-th bin are summarized in Table 1 below., 105093=Specifically, turning now to FIG. 15, a block diagram of an alternative embodiment of the present invention is shown. The block diagram is similar to that shown in the preferred embodiment except for additional components adapted to remove the in-band distortion from the power amplifier output. The transmitter 1000 includes a power amplifier 1002, a downconverter/demodulator 1004, an upconverter/modulator 1006, a trainer 1008, a predistorter 1010, a low-pass filter (LPF) 1012, first summer 1016 and second summer 1014, broadcast antenna 1024, and directional coupler 1026., 81543=FIG. 12 is a functional block diagram of the trainer 431 (FIG. 5), which includes a solver 1201, a validator 1203, an interpolator/extrapolator 1205 and an averager 1207, according to one embodiment of the present invention. The solver 1201 also includes the functionality of the direct inverse modeller 503. The trainer 431, including the solver 1201, is implemented with a TMS320C44 DSP microprocessor and associated memory, to function as follows. The trainer 431 receives and stores the modulation signal samples from the transmitter controller (not shown)., 89731=The multiplier 1303 then multiplies each PAout sample with the corresponding scalar output signal of the envelope filter 1301. This product and the PAout sample are then formatted or ordered into a row vector, as indicated by the block 1313. The matrix transposer 1307 then transposes and performs a complex conjugation of the row vector, thereby forming a column vector. The multiplier 1304 then multiplies this column vector with the corresponding PAin sample, resulting in a column vector The column vector F is stored in the data buffer 1309 along with the corresponding predistorter LUT address for the PAout sample. Similarly, the multiplier 1305 then multiplies the row matrix from the block 1313 with the column matrix from the matrix transposer 1307, resulting in a two-by-two square matrix R, which is also stored in the data buffer 1309 along with the corresponding predistorter LUT address., 33998=This application is related to a co-pending application entitled \"Method and Apparatus for Linear Transmission By Straight Inverse Modeling\" to Leyendecker et al., Ser. No. 08/850,940, filed on May 5, 1997, assigned to the same assignee herein, and expressly incorporated in its entirety by reference herein., 91951=FIG. 13A is a flow diagram illustrating the process of determining complex parameters for updating the predistorter LUT, according to one embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIGS. 12, 13 and 13A, the solver 1201 calculates complex \"inverse\" parameters corresponding to the predistorter LUT addresses, as indicated by a block 1321 in the flow chart of FIG. 13A. In particular, the solver 1201 receives a block of synchronized modulation signal samples, PAin samples, PAout samples and LUT addresses. As described above in conjunction with FIG. 12, these samples are quantized into bins corresponding to LUT addresses. The samples may also be interpolated to increase their numbers as described in conjunction with FIG. 12. The solver 1201 calculates complex parameters by forming the F and R matrices for each table bin as described above in conjunction with FIG. 13 to implement a pseudo-linear least squares technique. The F and R matrices are derived and applied to equation 1:, 88099=FIG. 12B is a functional block diagram of yet another embodiment of the trainer 431. This embodiment is substantially similar to the embodiment of FIG. 12A except that the averager 1207 is connected between the solver 1201 and the interpolator/extrapolator 1205. Thus, the calculated parameters are averaged with the stored parameters before the interpolation/extrapolation process. The operation of this embodiment is described further below in conjunction with FIG. 13B., 94463=The term ENVfilterouti is used to denote the scalar output sample of the envelope filter 1301 (e.g., see FIG. 9 for an FIR digital filter implementation for the envelope filter 1301) corresponding to the i-th PAout sample, with Nj being the number of samples in the j-th bin. The term PAoutpoweri is the power of the i-th PAout sample, as defined in equation 2 below., 109907=Further, as in the preferred embodiment, the modulated input is provided directly as an input to trainer 1008. Also as in the preferred embodiment, the trainer has a third input that is the input signal to the power amplifier 1002. Thus, the trainer 1008 has three inputs: the modified power amplifier output signal, the modulated input, and the input to the power amplifier. Each of these three inputs are acted upon by the trainer 1008 in accordance with the description above to generate numeric values that provided to look up table 1020 for use by the predistorter 1010., 107735=Next, the downconverter/demodulator 1004 also includes an analog to digital converter for converting the analog received signal into a digital signal. Finally, the downconverter/demodulator 1004 acts to demodulate the digital signal into a digital complex baseband signal having in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components., 87533=FIG. 12A is a functional block diagram of the trainer 431 (FIG. 5), according to another embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment is substantially similar to the embodiment of FIG. 12, except that the validator 1203 is part of the solver 1201. This embodiment can be advantageously used to qualify data before the parameter calculations are completed. Thus, when the validator 1203 detects unreliable data for a particular bin, the bin can be immediately emptied and the calculations for that bin terminated to reduce processing time., 101510=FIG. 14 is a block diagram of a DSP module 1400 for implementing a predistorter and trainer, according to one embodiment of the present invention. The DSP module 1400 is substantially similar to the DSP module disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,732,333, but a brief description is included herein for completeness. The DSP module 1400 includes a microprocessor 1401, a static random access memory (SRAM) 1403 and a nonvolatile memory (NVM) 1405. In a preferred embodiment, the microprocessor 1401 is a DSP microprocessor TMS320C44 available from Texas Instruments, although any suitable microprocessor can be used. The microprocessor 1401 is connected to the SRAM 1403 and the NVM 1405. In this embodiment, the NVM 1405 is implemented using a flash electrically programmable read only memory (EPROM). As a result, the DSP module 1400 can be configured or programmed for a variety of functions, such as, for example, forming part of a modulator, interpolator, trainer or predistorter. Further, the DSP module 1400 can be reprogrammed to change its functionality by replacing the configuration program stored in the nonvolatile memory 1405., 109294=Next, the in-band error signal is added to the output of the downconverter/demodulator 1004 at second summer 1014. This has the effect of subtracting the in-band distortion from the output of the downconverter/demodulator 1004. The output of the second summer 1014 is referred to as the modified power amplifier output signal. The modified power amplifier output signal is then used by the trainer 1008 (as discussed above) to calculate the values stored in look up table 1020 of predistorter 1022. Thus, the modified power amplifier output replaces the power amplifier output shown in FIG. 6., 88591=FIG. 13 is a functional block diagram of the solver 1201 (FIG. 12). The solver 1201 includes an envelope filter 1301, multipliers 1303, 1304, and 1305, a matrix transposer 1307, a data buffer 1309 and a parameter calculator 1311. These functions are implemented in the TMS320C44 DSP microprocessor and associated memory of the trainer 431 (FIG. 7). The solver 1201 receives the PAin samples and PAout samples and the addresses corresponding to these samples in the predistorter's LUT derived from the modulation signal samples. Considering the process which takes place in the solver 1201 on a sample by sample basis, the envelope filter 1301 filters each PAout sample and provides a scalar output sample as a function of previous PAout samples to the multiplier 1303. In this embodiment, the envelope filter 1301 is implemented in the same manner as the envelope filter 900 FIG. 9 or other versions depicted in FIGS. 9A, 10 or 10A) of the predistorter. Consequently, the memory effects of the PAout samples are determined in the same manner as in the predistorter., 77861=FIG. 10A illustrates an envelope filter block 1010 similar to that in FIG. 10 but in which the sample power calculator is replaced by a sample magnitude calculator 1012., 108077=The output of the downconverter/demodulator 1004 is then provided as an input to the first summer 1016 and the second summer 1014. Another input of the first summer 1016 is the modulated input. First summer 1016 is operative to subtract the output of downconverter/demodulator 1004 from the modulated input to form an error signal. Because the output of the downconverter/demodulator 1004 (derived from the output of the power amplifier 1002) is subtracted from the modulated input, the error signal is the negative of the distortion caused by the power amplifier 1002., 91142=In alternative embodiments, additional envelope filters and multipliers may be included in the solver 1201 (as indicated in dashed lines in FIG. 13) to implement other memory effect modeling algorithms. Each additional envelope filter adds another column to the row vector provided by the block 1313, as well as another column and row to the square matrix R generated by the multiplier 1305. For example, addition of one additional envelope filter would cause the row vector from the block 1313 to have three columns and the matrix R to be a three-by-three square matrix. The solver 1201 then uses substantially the same algorithms as for the two-level memory effect model to process this increased amount of data with, of course, an increase in the processing time for each block of data., 106906=Directional coupler 1026 monitors the output of the power amplifier 1002 by monitoring the signal transmitted by broadcast antenna 1024. The output of the power amplifier 1002 is then input into downconverter/demodulator 1004. The downconverter/demodulator 1004 performs exactly the opposite function as the upconverter/modulator 1006. Namely, the downconverter/demodulator 1004 acts to first decrease the frequency of the received signal from the desired broadcast RE channel. It is important that upconverter/modulator 1006 and downconverter/demodulator 1004 be precisely matched to each other in terms of frequency conversion. In other words, the frequency of the output of the downconverter/demodulator 1004 should be substantially the same as the frequency of the input of the upconverter/modulator 1006., 79560=In addition, the instantaneous power or magnitude sample from the sample power (or magnitude) calculator 1101 is received by the averager 1107. In this embodiment, the averager 1107 calculates the mean of the instantaneous power or magnitude samples of the current and one or more previous power or magnitude samples. This simple scheme provides a relatively good indication of the trajectory of the instantaneous power or magnitude envelope of the current power or magnitude sample without requiring a relatively large amount of processing time, memory and hardware. Of course, in other embodiments, the average may be calculated using different schemes. For example, the average may be calculated from a different number of previous power or magnitude samples, or by using a weighted averaging scheme that gives less weight for the oldest power or magnitude samples. Then, the multiplier 1109 and quantizer 1111 provide the table address for the selection of alternative tables 8061 -806M (FIG. 8) as described above for the multiplier 1103 and quantizer 1105., 99950=FIG. 13B is a flow diagram illustrating the process of determining complex parameters for updating the predistorter LUT, according to another embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment is substantially similar to the embodiment described in conjunction with FIG. 13A except that the validation process is performed prior to calculation of the parameters. In particular, in an initial step 1331, the solver receives a block of synchronized modulation signal samples, PAin samples, PAout samples and LUT addresses as in the step 1321 (FIG. 13A). Before calculating the complex data for each table bin, the validator qualifies the parameter in a manner similar to the validator 1203 (FIG. 12A). For example, the standard deviation of the samples in a bin can be calculated and if exceeding a predetermined threshold, the bin is emptied. If the data is unreliable, the calculation process for that particular bin is not done, thereby reducing the trainer processing time. The process then proceeds to the steps 1325, 1327 and 1329 as described above in conjunction with FIG. 13A., 78050=FIG. 11 is a functional block diagram of the address generator 707 of the predistortion filter 601 (FIG. 7), according to one embodiment of the present invention. The address generator 707 has a sample power calculator 1101, multipliers 1103 and 1109, quantizers 1105 and 1111, and an averager 1107. The sample power calculator 1101 receives the current modulation signal sample and outputs a signal representing the magnitude of the instantaneous power envelope of the current modulation signal sample. Alternatively, a sample magnitude calculator may be used instead of the sample power calculator 1101 in other embodiments in which the predistortion scheme is based on the magnitude of the modulation signal instead of power. The aforementioned TMS320C44 DSP microprocessor (not shown) implementing the predistortion filter 601 is programmed to calculate the power or magnitude from the digital modulation signal samples., 78994=The instantaneous power or magnitude sample from the sample power (or magnitude) calculator 1101 is received by the multiplier 1103, which then scales the instantaneous power or magnitude sample by a constant in order to match the range of table memory addresses. The scaled instantaneous power or magnitude sample is then quantized by the quantizer 1105. This quantized value serves as the table address for the LUT 603 (FIG. 7), which stores the values describing the complex inverse characteristic for the branches of the predistortion filter., 83360=The solver 1201 then periodically processes a \"batch\" or \"block\" of this stored data to generate the complex parameters used to update the LUT of the predistorter. In particular, the trainer uses the instantaneous power or magnitude of the modulation signal samples to generate the write addresses of the predistorter LUT at which the trainer stores the complex inverse characteristics obtained by the direct inverse modeller 503 (i.e., indexing the LUT using the modulation signal samples). The write addresses are obtained in the same way as the read addresses as described with respect to FIG. 11., 84000=In one embodiment of the solver 1201, it first performs interpolation to increase the number and time resolution of the samples used in the training. In one embodiment, this interpolation is used to achieve, in effect, a 48M samples/second sampling rate. This interpolation has been found to improve the linearization of the transmitter output signals. The trainer 431 then quantizes the samples into \"bins\" that are equal in number to the number of table addresses in the predistorter LUT. In the preferred embodiment, the validator 1203 checks that there are enough data samples in a bin and that their distribution is statistically significant (i.e., not too much variation). If the values associated with a bin are qualified by the validator 1203, then the average of these values is calculated to derive a new complex parameter value for each bin. For example, in one embodiment, a least squares method is used to determine an average value of the complex parameter for each bin. The calculated values for each bin can then be used to update the predistorter LUT. In a further refinement, each calculated parameter can be averaged or filtered with the corresponding previously trained parameters (or, alternatively, a weighted average of previously trained parameters) to generate the updated parameter. This averaging is used to smooth out changes in the parameter and to get a better parameter estimate. This value can then be used to update the predistorter LUT., 85500=In the qualification process, the validator 1203 checks each parameter value to determine whether each parameter value is reliable. Each reliable parameter is then stored at the corresponding address of the predistorter's LUT (i.e., at the address defined by the address generator for the quantized modulation signal sample). In addition, any parameters calculated for bins having a number of samples below a predetermined threshold are discarded, resulting in empty bins. The interpolator/extrapolator 1205 then determines the parameters of the empty bins (if any) by interpolation or extrapolation from the other surrounding bins. Then the averager 1207 averages each calculated parameter with the corresponding parameter currently stored in the predistorter LUT. When averaging a calculated parameter with the corresponding current parameter in the predistorter LUT, the trainer reads the contents of the predistorter LUT into the trainer. Similarly, when averaging a calculated parameter with a weighted average of past parameters, the trainer may include a memory array storing the running weighted average. These averaged values are then used to update the predistorter LUT. In this embodiment, the solver, validator, interpolation/extrapolation and averaging functions are implemented in the TMS320C44 DSP microprocessor and associated memory (not shown) using techniques well known in the art of digital linear transmitters. The operation of the trainer 431 is described further below in conjunction with FIGS. 13 and 13A., 101077=In still another embodiment, the step 1327 may be performed before the step 1325. That is, the calculated parameter values may be averaged with the corresponding current (or, alternatively, a running weighted average of past) predistorter LUT parameters before empty bins are interpolated or extrapolated. Accordingly, averaging only takes place with calculated parameters that have passed the validation process., 99012=In a next step 1325, the interpolator/extrapolator 1205 fills in the emptied bins by interpolation or extrapolation from other surrounding bins which were trained. A simple linear interpolation or extrapolation between the nearest bins that passed validation can be performed, but in a preferred embodiment, the interpolation and extrapolation is performed using standard curve fitting techniques that take into account the whole range of values that passed the validation process. These calculated values can then be used directly to update the parameters in the predistorter LUT. However, in a preferred embodiment, a next step 1327 is performed in which the averager 1207 finds a weighted average of these new parameters and the current parameters. Typically, the averaging is done so that the more weight is given to the most recent parameters. These weighted averages are then used to update the predistorter LUT., 105690=In operation, the modulated input is provided to the predistorter 1010. The predistorter is preferably comprised of an address generator 1018, a look up table 1020, and a non-linear predistortion filter 1022. These elements of the predistorter 1010 are detailed above. The modulated input is a digital complex baseband signal including in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components. The predistorter 1010 is operative to filter the modulated input so as to \"predistort\" the modulated input. The output of the predistorter 1010 is provided to the upconverter/modulator 1006. The function of the upconverter/modulator 1006 is twofold. First, the upconverter/modulator 1006 acts to combine the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components of the modulated input. Second, the upconverter/modulator 1006 acts to increase the frequency of the signal to the desired broadcast RF channel. Further, the upconverter 1006 also includes a digital to analog converter for converting the digital signal output by predistorter 1010 into an analog signal for transmission. The output of the upconverter 1006 is then provided to power amplifier 1002 for amplification and broadcast by broadcast antenna 1024., 108666=The error signal is provided to LPF 1012. In the preferred embodiment, LPF 1012 has a cutoff frequency of 24 kHz. However, it can be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the cutoff frequency may be adjusted depending upon the bandwidth of the desired broadcast RF channel. The function of LPF 1012 is to remove that part of the error signal that is outside of the desired broadcast RF channel (referred to as \"out-of-band\"). The output of LPF 1012 is referred to as the in-band error signal. The in-band error signal is the negative of the in-band distortion caused by power amplifier 1002., 95234=In addition, for each bin, the multiplier 1304 then multiplies the PAin samples with the column vector from the matrix transposer 1307 to form the column vector matrix F. The elements of the column vector F for the j-th bin are set forth in Table 2 below., 76383=FIG. 10 is a functional block diagram of an envelope filter 1000 implemented with an infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filter, according to another embodiment of the present invention. The envelope filter 1000 includes the sample power calculator 902, the delay circuit 904, the adder 906, a second delay circuit 1002 and a gain block 1004. The delay circuit 904, adder 906, delay circuit 1002 and gain block 1004 form an IIR digital filter. In particular, the sample power calculator 902 provides a signal representing the power of the current modulation signal sample to the delay circuit 904 and the adder 906. The delay circuit 904 then provides the power of the previous modulation signal sample to the adder 906. The adder 906 also receives a scaled version of the previous output sample of the envelope filter from the delay circuit 1002 and the gain block 1004. To ensure stability of the IIR digital filter, the gain block 1004 scales each output sample before the output sample is stored in the delay circuit 1002. The adder 906 then subtracts this previous modulation sample power from the sum of the current modulation signal power and the previous envelope filter output sample to generate the output signal of the envelope filter. The sample power calculator 902 and the IIR filter are implemented by the TMS320C44 DSP microprocessor and associated memory (not shown) using techniques well known in the art of digital linear transmitters., 96590=The term det R is used in Table 3 to denote the determinant of the matrix R. Then in a step 1323, the validator 1203 empties the bins having parameters that are unreliable (e.g., outside of predetermined limits or are statistically too varying) or are generated from too few samples., 90697=The parameter calculator 1311 then accesses the data in the data buffer 1309 to calculate the values of the complex parameters serving as a basis for updating the predistorter LUT. The parameters are processed by the validator 1203, interpolator/extrapolator 1205 and averager 1207 of the trainer 431 (FIG. 12) to generate the values for updating the predistorter LUT, as described further below in conjunction with FIG. 13A.}",

Accordingly, while the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that in light of the present disclosure, various changes can be made to the described embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Further, as in the preferred embodiment, the modulated input is provided directly as an input to trainer 1008. Also as in the preferred embodiment, the trainer has a third input that is the input signal to the power amplifier 1002.
