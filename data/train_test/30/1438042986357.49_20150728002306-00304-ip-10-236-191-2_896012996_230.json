            "There is quite a bot of crime that happens near campus, so be weary. There are volunteer services like the Campus Safety Escort Service that can help ensure your safety by escorting you to your car the University Village, or even your apartment near campus. Also there is also a shuttle service for students who would rather get a ride to their residence; all you need is your student ID to receive the service.",
            "The Greek life is as diverse as the campus; many cultural programs have some sort of fraternity of sorority, some are many community service based, some scholarly based, and even the LGBT center has a fraternity, so look for ones that are most relevant to you.",
            "Check out the highlander Link, https://highlanderlink.ucr.edu, there are many things to become involved in. There are hundreds of organizations to get involved in, so start with looking for ones that interest you.",
            "Those who enjoy participating in extracurricular activities.",
            "Hike to the C, it is good fun and exercise.",
            "UCR will give you your moneys worth if you choose to do more than study and isolate yourself. There are constantly cultural events going on in Riverside, so get involved and your experience will be worth the money you paid.",
            "Go out and explore Riverside with friends, there are many restaurants at the University Village, as well as entertainment options in downtown riverside. The Culver Center is a nice place to explore if you are into art. Also there are many recreation classes you can take at the Rec center on campus. If you like to dance, try taking a dance course on campus or join one of the many dance organizations on campus.",
            "The food is pretty good, but not comparable to a home cooked meal. They do offer a wide array of food to choose from. They also have options for vegans and vegetarians.",
            "I would recommend staying at Aberdeen Inverness because the way its is structured, it is most accommodating for socializing and meeting different people.",
            "The difficulty of a class entirely depends on how much effort you put into it; planning ahead and getting work done early will ease the burden of a class. However, if you procrastinate, it will cause a course to be that much more difficult; so be responsible.",
            "Be open to new experiences and meeting people who are different from yourself. Get involved in campus activities;It will definitely help you to figure out what you want to do with your life, if you haven't already. Also take advantage of campus resources that exist, they are there to help you succeed. Try to check out the career center during welcome week and attend a career center event, because this will definitely help you establish a network that can help you land a job in your preferred field once you graduate.",
            "The University of California, Riverside is an excellent university with a diverse student body. UCR students are actively involved in campus organizations and display a passion for helping out their community. Although UCR may not be the highest ranking university in the United States, it is definitely a place where you'll be exposed to people who come from different walks of life and learn from those interactions."

The city has a diverse selection of foods from American food, to Thai food, Indian food, Vietnamese food, etc and Asahi which is one of the most delicious All-You-Can-Eat restaurants around. May I add that these places are legit and not Americanized. Since it's really hot you can go swimming all the time. Some people hike the C which is a C on the top of a mountain. You can join clubs like Surf Club (they take you surfing) or outdoor excursions (they take you on countless trips). A lot of people also spend time at the gym playing intramurals., 473889=There's not too many unusual traditions I know of besides the school priding itself of its Scottish heritage through an occasional bagpipe practice every now and then, that can be heard from the residence halls. Our concerts held every school quarter have been traditions for many years, welcoming notable artists such as J.Cole, Lupe Fiasco, Nas, Mac Miller, Karmin, The Roots, Common, Kendrick Lamar, Chiddy Bang, Dev & The Cataracs, and more who have blessed UCR with their presence at some point in time. Being that our Botanical Garden is apart of the UCR campus, its not too unusual of a place, but definitely one that's uniquely beautiful., 686211=There has been a string of robberies on and near campus since January of 2013 . Students have been targeted for technology. Lap tops, I-Pads, and Smart Phones have been taken by force. The school has been scrutinized in the local newspaper as well a TV news cast. Escort services are available 24/7. The campus appears to be safe and tranquil, but I would not suggest walking in the surrounding community after dark alone. In all fairness, I would not walk around the part of Riverside I live in after dark alone either., 932456=Taking AP classes in high school and don't get lower than a B and you will have the GPA you need. Assuming of course that you absolutely do not fail any classes. From there, take the SAT or ACT a couple times and try to get above 1750 and you will be good to go., 691643=Admissions office considers the entire package- strength of transcript, SAT and SAT subject exam scores, and extracurriuluars all play a role in the decision making process. UCR had over 40,000 students apply for admission for the fall of 2013. For many students, UCR is a first choice rather than a backup school., 657457=Some days are better than others. Sometimes they have themes such a Cajun night or Thanksgiving Dinner and those nights the food is amazing. I personally liked the Dining Halls and as a student who no longer lives on campus I miss them., 513159=Lothian resident, Nicer than A-I, Pentland Hill is really nice but expensive. People at AI are more down to earth at least when I went there. Lothian people tend to be a bit clicky. Still both are expensive because of meal plan. May find a better deal off campus., 877551=They have limited greek life and the sororities/fraternities they do have are mostly community service based. On the up side, this means they cost only about 40 to 50 dollars a year instead of $2000 a quarter., 518259=2011-2012 school year we burned UC Irvine's mascot, the Anteater. That was really amusing and a great experience. We had fireworks shoot out from the buildings' rooftops to give a spectacular show., 1088951=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot In transitioning from high school to college/university, UCR helps students to be able to learn new subjects as well new skills. At the same time, students would be able to meet new people and become more confident in their environment. You can learn a lot from people's perspectives about different things as well your surroundings. You learn to become independent and responsible over time.

Also, UC Riverside is a great place to learn about independence as well as being responsible for yourself away from your parents. Tips for prospective students Get involved on campus!
