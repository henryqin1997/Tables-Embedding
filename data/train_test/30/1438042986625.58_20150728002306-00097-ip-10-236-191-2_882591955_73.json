            "I feel very safe at my school because I always see the police golf carts patrolling throughout campus.",
            "The game room on campus is located right outside the Warrior Grill. There are TVs, pool tables, ping pong tables, and even an Xbox hooked up for anyone to play. It's a great place to be stress-free and enjoy hanging out with friends. The lounge right next to it is the perfect place to just relax and maybe get some shut-eye before your next class.",
            "The food choices on campus are great! They have Italian food, Mexican food, sandwiches, a great variety of drinks and a huge, spacious cafeteria. There are also choices for students who are vegetarians such as salads, veggie burgers, and so much more. Both the cafeteria and the Warrior Grill are great places to eat. For all the Starbucks lovers, we have one on campus!!",
            "The freshmen dorms are very nice. In the ones I have seen, each person gets their own room so you still have your privacy. You just have to share the bathroom and living room. The set-up of the dorms gives a village/neighborhood feel so it is very welcoming.",
            "The transition from high school to college can be extremely overwhelming. There is so much work in college and it might take some first-year freshmen a while to adjust to that change. The amount of work demanded is highly achievable if students stay focused and make an honest effort.",
            "Academically, I would strongly advise students NOT to procrastinate on anything. Also, many professors will tell their students that no question is a dumb question, and they are so right!",
            "I chose to attend CSU Stanislaus mainly because of the distance. I knew it was close enough that I could still live at home and not miss important family events. Once I went on the campus tour and saw how beautiful it was, I knew 100% that I wanted to go there."

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students If you really want to just get out and want a new scene or if you want a peaceful small school its perfect. Tips for prospective students Come check out the campus see it you like it. Once you've decided to come here make sure to get involved on campus it opens so many doors. If you can I highly advise doing Student Leadership Program during the summer you'll meet so many new people. Also make sure you go to as many events at school because all the events we put together it's for the students and you're paying for it through ur student fees so get your moneys worth by going. Bang for the buck Since the school is very small it's as if your paying the price of a public school but the quality of a private school. The school really tries to get the most out of the budget. If you go to most of the events on campus you will totally get your moneys worth. Am enjoying being here I love being at Stan State. The campus is small and cute. Its like a little taste of nature. It's a very relaxing",
