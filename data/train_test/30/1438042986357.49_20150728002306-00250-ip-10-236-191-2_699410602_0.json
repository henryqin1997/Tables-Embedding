New England\u2019s most venerable Thanksgiving Day race, the 4.748-mile Manchester Road Race, is expected to have 15,000 competitors for its 77th running, including 2012\u2019s top three male finishers, Aaron Braun, Haron Lagat, and Donn Cabral. A year ago, Braun tied Phillimon Hanneck\u2019s 1995 course record of 21:19, and he\u2019s coming off the 12K national title a week and a half ago. Lagat won in Manchester in 2009. Cabral, a 2012 steeplechase Olympian, is Manchester\u2019s local hero; he\u2019s from the nearby town of Glastonbury., 30297=If you value lasting power more than size, then you'd probably enjoy running the YMCA Turkey Trot 8K in Buffalo, New York, which has been run every year since 1896, and is therefore the oldest continuously run road race in the United States. Berwick, Pennsylvania\u2019s Run for the Diamonds, a 9-miler that should draw about 2,000 runners, is also one of the oldest races in the country. It was first run in 1908, and has been every year since except 1918 and 1919., 37459=Olympic 10,000-meter silver medalist Sally Kipyego of Kenya heads a women\u2019s roster that includes 2013 NCAA 10,000-meter champion Betsy Saina, American Olympic steeplechaser Bridget Franek, and 2013 USA indoor 3000-meter champion Chelsea Reilly. Lukas Verzbicas will be at the Oceanside Turkey Trot, a 5-miler along the California coast. Verzbicas\u2019 recovery from a devastating cycling accident in 2012 is every bit as remarkable as the prowess that made him the fifth U.S. high school runner to break 4:00 for the mile and, later on, a world junior champion in the triathlon. \u00a0 \u201cI will be running for the win,\u201d Verzbicas told the Oceanside-Camp Pendleton Patch. \u201cI am still coming back from my spinal cord injury last year and am in a heavy training block right now. I am very excited to run alongside 10,000 of my fellow Southern Californians.\u201d Verzbicas lives in Chula Vista and works out at the nearby U. S. Olympic Training Center. On Thursday, there will probably be a race near where you live or might be visiting. Use our race finder to locate your closest opportunity to join the fun., 5159=Copyright \u00a9 2015 Rodale Inc.

As Race Results Weekly reports, the men\u2019s field features the 2012 runner-up Leonard Korir, a Kenyan who competed for Iona college, plus American mile record holder Alan Webb, three-time national road mile champion David Torrence, Mexican 5000-meter Olympian Diego Estrada, and .US Championships 12K runner-up Shadrack Biwott., 28423=As we reported earlier this month, Thanksgiving Day now far surpasses the Fourth of July as the most popular holiday for road racing in the United States, with 676.000 competitors having raced on Thanksgiving in 2011. Running USA, a nonprofit organization that keeps tabs on road racing trends, knows of 470 turkey trots in the United States on Thursday. The races run the gamut, from huge, multi-distance events and races with elite fields to small-town celebrations and some of the oldest road races in the country. Last year, the five largest Thanksgiving races were:, 36461=Manchester\u2019s women\u2019s field features 2012 Olympic marathoner Desiree Davila, who is now on the Hansons team roster under her married name Desiree Linden, and the race\u2019s 2012 women\u2019s runner-up, Lisa Uhl. Runner\u2019s World\u2019s Amby Burfoot, the 1968 Boston Marathon champ, will be doing this race for the 51st year in a row. He won it nine times between 1968 and 1977.}",
