The existing indices were: the 2008 Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM) and the 2007 Global Gender Gap Index (GGI) Economic Participation and Opportunity, GGI Education, and GGI Political Participation sub-indices [52\u201354]. Indices of women\u2019s reproductive autonomy and context of violence against women were created. In addition to the theoretical reasons for including gender equality in economic participation and opportunity and the context of violence against women described in the introduction, the GEM and other indices were included mainly because of their use in previous research related to gender equality and health [7\u20139,15,55]., 18842=Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7(5), 2136-2160; doi:10.3390/ijerph7052136, 50480=Economic status Gross Domestic Product per capita 2006 (GDP) and the Human Development Index (HDI) were both considered as indicators of country-level economic status. The two measures were highly correlated (0.82) and multilevel findings from the HDI were similar to GDP. Therefore, only results for GDP are reported here as it was less correlated with the other country level variables than the HDI (See Table 3). Differences in findings between HDI and GDP are noted in the text., 36693=Survey samples come from the multi-country GENACIS project [50]. Twenty-two of the GENACIS countries were included in this study. These countries are at varying stages of development and in several geographic areas across six continents [See Table 1]. Methods were mostly similar across countries, although there was variation. See Table 1 for details. Surveys in each country were conducted between 2000 and 2007. Many sampling frames were national or nearly national, whereas others represented a state (e.g., in India) or areas within a country. Regional studies generally focused on large populations centers within the country. In several cases, the areas within the country account for more than 50% of the country\u2019s total population., 51074=Missing values Data for each country, with the exception of Isle of Man, were available for GGI sub-indices and GDP. Missing data was dealt with by substituting values with those from similar countries and by multiple imputation. First, country-level data for the Isle of Man were unavailable. Data from the United Kingdom was deemed to be the most appropriate country based on both current and prior British influence and therefore were directly substituted. Second, for the 2008 GEM data were unavailable for India and Nigeria. GEM scores from 1999 and 1996, respectively, were used., 90684=Funding for this work was provided by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)/National Institutes of Health (Grants R21 AA012941 and R01 AA015775), the German Federal Ministry of Health, the Pan American Health Organization, and Swiss national funds. Additional funding for preparation for this manuscript was, in part, supported by NIAAA Center Grant (P30 AA005595) and Training Grant (T32 AA07240).
