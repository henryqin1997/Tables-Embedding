Horschel, who finished sixth in the 2013 FedExCup standings with one win and seven top 10 finishes in 22 events, won the Zurich Classic exactly one year ago. Every, via his first career PGA Tour win just over two weeks ago at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, is currently ranked eighth in the FedExCup. The golfers will open the first round teeing off back-to-back \u2013 Horschel at 8:51 a.m., Every at 9:02 a.m. \u2013 while former Florida golfer Andy North will be on the call for ESPN during the first two days of the event on Thursday and Friday., 20549=1 \u00bb Already in the midst of a Most Valuable Player-caliber campaign, Chicago Bulls center Joakim Noah on Wednesday became just the fourth center in NBA history to record four triple-doubles consisting of points, rebounds and assists in a single season. The other three? Wilt Chamberlain, David Robinson and Bill Russell. Noah, whose final line was 15 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists, has led the Bulls to a 46-32 record despite the fact that Chicago has been without star point guard Derek Rose nearly the entire season. The \u201cpoint-center,\u201d who leads his team with 5.2 assists per game, achieved double-digit dimes for the seventh time and also became the first Bulls player since Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen (1992-93) to record four triple-doubles in a single season. For comparison\u2019s sake, Noah posted just three triple-doubles and two double-digit assists games \u2013 combined \u2013 during his first six years. Additionally, Houston Rockets head coach Kevin McHale just last month said Noah \u201cshould be the defensive player of the year.\u201d Check out this extensive feature on Noah from USA Today., 20907=Posted by Adam Silverstein | Posted in Basketball | April 10, 2014, 18228=3 \u00bb Horschel and Every competed together alongside Gators golf coach Buddy Alexander on Wednesday in the Masters Par 3 Contest where Alexander, 61, registered the 80th hole-in-one in event history (dating back to 1960). Alexander, the 1987 U.S. Amateur champion, played in The Masters that same year. Joining the three Florida golfers on the course Wednesday were another pair of former Gators including 67-year-old Steve Melnyk (who finished tied for 29th) and 53-year-old Mark Calcavecchia. Horschel, Every and Calcavecchia did not register scores., 17363=4 \u00bb Thought those were the only Gators connections to The Masters? Former Florida golfer Fred Ridley, a member of UF\u2019s 1973 national championship team who competed in five majors but missed the cut each time (thrice in The Masters), is the chair of the competition committee and will be a rules official at the event over the next four days. Ridley, who also happens to be the last U.S. Amateur champion to never take a turn as a professional golfer, played a major role in the Tiger Woods \u201cdrop\u201d ruling from 2013., 16076=6 \u00bb Golden State Warriors power forward David Lee has missed the last six games dealing with a strange injury as he has been dealing with nerve damage in the area connecting his back to his right hamstring. Lee, who tore his right hip flexor in the first game of the 2013 NBA Playoffs but remained an active non-participant for his team, hopes to avoid missing the postseason again. \u201cI\u2019m so frustrated that I\u2019m almost not frustrated anymore,\u201d he told the Associated Press. \u201cEven watching practice is just miserable or me. It\u2019s such a fun time of year and obviously I\u2019d be lying if last year how the season ended didn\u2019t factor into that.\u201d There is no timetable for Lee to return to the court, but Golden State\u2019s regular season comes to an end on April 16. The Warriors are currently 48-29 and slated as the sixth seed in the Western Conference.}",
