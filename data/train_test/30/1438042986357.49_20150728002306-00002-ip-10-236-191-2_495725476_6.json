Thus, the tray can be quickly attached again to the same balcony without further adjustment of the leg sections. To disassemble the tray for storage after use, it is only necessary to remove the tray surface 22 by unclipping it from the two vertical frames 24 and 24' and then folding or collapsing the two frames inwardly one on top of the other between the two leg sections 46, 46'. The tray can then be stored away with the tray surface 22 placed on top of the collapsed frames. Attachment to the balcony is easily and quickly accomplished by simply placing the hangers 34, 34' from each frame over the railing 14 allowing the elongated, horizontal support tube 44 to rest against the row of vertical pilaster boards 16 as shown in FIGS. 2-4. The brace 42 is then adjusted by moving the two leg sections 46, 46' in either a forward or rearward direction to level and stabilize the tray surface 22 in a substantially horizontal plane. Finally, the two compression nuts 48, 48' are tightened to secure the legs and the brace in place. The tray can be quickly assembled by pressing two aligned flexible clips 56 on the underneath side of the tray surface 22 over",
