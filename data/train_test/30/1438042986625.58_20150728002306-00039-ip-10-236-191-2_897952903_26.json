            "The college is so great about safety. They have people on patrol 24/7 and the college security is always ready to take a call and help someone even if its just to accompany them in a walk across campus. It really makes the college feel like a safe haven.",
            "Since The College of Saint Rose is a private school, it is quite expensive but you wont be wasting your money. The college uses their money to buy new resources for their students and accommodate important needs. They also use their money to make the school better for their students, giving them a nice learning environment and nice living situations.",
            "It's Albany! There is always so much to do. The malls are less than ten minutes away. Movie theaters as well. Clubs, especially if you're of age then there is more clubs and bars you can attend, right in walking distance! The college has a very nice fitness center, if you love working out and there is usually always some event going on.",
            "The food is much better here than at most places you see. They give you quite a variety to choose from during each meal. The only thing is that there are time constraints so when you get those It's two a.m., I need a snack days its good to stock up on snacks for your room.",
            "The Dorms are actually quite nice! I enjoyed where I was placed my first semester there. Like other colleges there are basic buildings with dorm rooms but also, Saint Rose has rented/bought houses along the premises that they have created into dorms. It really makes you feel at home.",
            "The classes are not easy. Some of them you may have to dedicate your semester to. Although other classes you may find fairly easy, I think it just depends on your own perspective. The classes are here to challenge you.",
            "If you are looking for a comfortable environment with classes that will push you to do your best, you have found it. Join all and any classes you find appealing because you will not regret them. Try new clubs or even join some, this way you get to meet many new people and learn new things as well. Always ask your teachers for help. The professors are there to make YOU successful; they want to help.",
            "I absolutely fell in love with The College of Saint Rose. It's like a small community of people who are kind as well as devoted to their studies. The school is a wonderful place to be, I recommend applying!"

At times it is difficult to figure out why we pay so much to go there. The food is decent considering it is a college. We pay the activities fee so participate in as many of the events offered on campus as you want to considering you are already paying for it. The level of academics is pretty decent considering what you pay, the professors are really good and the housing is decent, and with the new addition of Centennial Hall opening in 2012, there are more places available to live., 206731=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Saint Rose is great for: -people who like getting involved in causes and improving the world -leaders -athletes -people who are serious about school but still like to have fun -those who want to try something different from what they might be used to at home (i.e. people from rural areas like me) -people who like living in a city environment -compassionate people -YOU! Tips for prospective students 1. Don't be swayed by the thought of alcohol and the parties you will hear about. EVERY single school in this country is a party school, but some hide it more than most. Saint Rose is a wet campus (so if you're 21 you can drink--with certain stipulations), and the apartments around the school are often dripping with alcohol, but that's not why you're here. You're here to learn, so put your studies first. 2. Get involved! There are a plethora of clubs to join and things to do, and if you don't like what you see, make one yourself! We're always open to new ideas, and it's been proven that if you are a part of a campus club, your grades are typically better, because you learn to balance your time. Plus, it's the surest way to beat boredom! 3. See what Albany has to offer. There are great concerts and music scenes, plays, art shows, and museums to check out,",
