Sat at the bar, nice bar tender, spent $28 on 2 rounds of drinks waiting for our table, were told that we could eat at a small bar table or wait for the next table. We said we would wait, they told us table was getting cleared, it was cleared and given to two people off the street. When we asked whats up got told sorry so we left, thanks Poco $20 bucks in cabs $28 bucks in drinks and you can't sit someone who made a reservation and your answer is come back and we will accodomadte you any time, thanks for the great experience will make sure to tell many people about this, 7890=Posted by joe bierniak on 08/09/2009, 9875=Posted by anonymous on 06/11/2009, 7182=Posted by jozie on 09/08/2009, 6561=Wandered in at 8:30 on a Friday, were seated reasonably fast, had great service, enjoyed the drinks (though I wish the Jalapeno-infused margarita was a bit spicier), had some fantastic food (as noted, the calamari and the lobster mac n' cheese are decadent and delicious), great service the whole way through. Fantastic time, would gladly go back., 6325=Posted by ERD on 10/30/2009, 4110=Posted by Alicia S on 01/28/2010, 9137=Posted by PSA on 07/27/2009}",
