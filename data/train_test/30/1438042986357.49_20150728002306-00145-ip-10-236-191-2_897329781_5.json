The 17-date trek includes a date at the Hangout Festival in Gulf Shores, Ala. and will see the Tennessee trio playing venues such as New York's Beacon Theatre, Grand Ole Opry in Nashville and Los Angeles' Dolby Theatre (formerly Kodak)., 1940=Paramore & Fall Out Boy Tour Dates Concerts Videos Paramore & Fall Out Boy Tour It\u2019s January, so it\u2019s time for\u2014you guessed it\u2014summer tour date announcements! Punk-pop fans, you\u2019re in luck, because Paramore and Fall Out Boy are heading out on what they\u2019re calling the \u201cMonumentour\u201d. The shows kick off on June 19 in Hartford,\u2026, 5794=Since the end of Monumentour, the members of Paramore have taken a bit of time to focus on their personal lives. But they made quite a splash to open 2015. At this year's Grammy Awards, Paramore won its first ever Grammy (Best Rock Song) for their most recent single, \"Ain't It Fun.\" Their self-titled album was also re-released, with bonus tracks including a version of \"Hate to See Your Heart Break\" featuring Joy Williams, the band's first collaboration., 3923=Paramore's latest album not only debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard charts in the United States, it also went to No. 1 in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina and Mexico. It came behind the new track \"Monster,\" featured on the \"Transformers: Dark Side of the Moon\" soundtrack, and another new song, \"Renegade,\" which was recorded at the same time as \"Monster.\" But the two lead singles from the album happened to be \"Now\" and \"Still Into You,\" released in January and March, respectively., 4819=After an ultra-successful Self-Titled Tour, the members of Paramore are spreading a little holiday cheer. Hayley, Jeremy and Taylor are playing Jingle Ball shows through the month of December, performing with the likes of Miley Cyrus, Robin Thicke and more \u2013 and bringing to the stage the same head banging, fist pumping, raucous shows they are known for., 4445=But something has changed with this band, which lost two founding members between the release of their third album, \"Brand New Eyes\" in 2009, and their eponymous project in 2013. Gone were Josh Farro, the group's primary songwriter and guitarist, and his brother, drummer Zac Farro. The three remaining members took the band's sound beyond the pop-punk that once dominated their sound. In its place is a new wave, sort of 1970s rock and other influences. And the change has been for the better., 2911=Rock band Paramore was formed in 2004 in Franklin, TN. In 2005, members Hayley Williams, Josh Farro, Jeremy Davis, Zac Farro and Taylor York released their debut album \"All We Know Is Falling\" and their concert tickets have been a hot item ever since. Their sophomore album \"Riot!\" was released in 2007 and went platinum in the United States and gold in Australia. Paramore's third album \"Brand New Eyes\" was released in 2009 and is the band's most successful album yet. The band is most recognized for its songs \"Misery Business\"\u009d and \"Decode,\"\u009d the latter being the lead single from the first \"Twilight\" movie soundtrack., 6474=Not long after the end of their successful Self-Titled Tour, Paramore quickly announced a co-headlining tour with Fall Out Boy -- named the Monumentour -- for the summer of 2014. In a short amount of time the band members' days were once again packed with interviews and tour prep, but it certainly didn't slow them down.}",
