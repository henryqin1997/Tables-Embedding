It would be a shame if they played all of Pyro, then played the normal list of 6 or 7 Hysteria songs. I'd be disappointed if they did that. I wouldn't mind Pyro+those 3 hysteria songs you mentioned plus 5 or so other songs. I don't think anything rare will be played. If they play Pyro all the way through, I think Comin Under Fire might be the only one they've never played. With Hysteria, you'd have Run Riot and Love and Affection that havent been played in a long time. Sadly, other than those, I don't think there will be anything super rare in there.
