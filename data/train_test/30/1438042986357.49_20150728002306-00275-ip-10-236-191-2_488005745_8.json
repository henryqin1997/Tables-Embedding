No. 08/878,864 filed Jun. 19, 1997, entitled \"Wireless Prepaid Telephone System With Dispensable Instruments,\" hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth fully herein., 33678=This is a continuation of Ser. No. 08/878,864, filed Jun. 19, 1997, U.S. Pat. No. 6,049,710., 79291=Next in order, a field 194 registers the instrument code, specifically a four digit number, e. g. 2139. The field 194 provides a reference for verification of the received instrument code that is tied to the instrument TI1 and provided by the user during each use to verify that the user is proper., 54468=The detailed operation and processes of the composite system are treated below; however, as certain aspects of mobile telecommunication are presently well known they are not explained in detail. For example, various identification methods, broadcast techniques and structures, authentication techniques, calling processes, cellular organizations and mobility managements are well known. Detailed descriptions of such aspects of mobile telecommunications are provided in a book entitled, Mobile Telecommunications Networking, by Michael D. Gallagher and Randal A. Snyder, McGraw Hill, 1997, ISBN 0-07-063314-2, incorporated by reference herein. Particularly, the book treats techniques for interfacing a plurality mobile stations or instruments through base stations with the public switched telephone network. Generally as disclosed in the present system, the central stations C1-Cn can be related as base stations to function with the server S which as stated above may embody various wireless network structures., 59629=Voice recognition units, as the unit 68, also are well known and have been developed to a attain a good level of reliably in identifying the spoken digits \"zero\" through \"nine\" in an audio form, even when communicated by telephone. For example, verbal recognition units providing an alternative to dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signals are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,509,060 issued Apr. 16, 1996 to Hall et al., 55502=Regarding another facet of mobile telecommunication, specifically fraud prevention, some aspects of the problem are facilitated by the system hereof. However, various security techniques are well known which may well be applicable to systems in accordance herewith. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,541,977 issued Jul. 30, 1996 to Hodges et al treats a system for the avoidance of wireless fraud. As another example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,450,479 issued Sep. 12, 1995 treats improved security for prepaid systems using telephone calling cards.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In view of the above explanations of exemplary systems and processes, it will be apparent the other embodiments and processes may be employed utilizing the developments hereof. Accordingly, the appropriate scope hereof is deemed appropriately determined on the basis of the claims as set forth below. To consider the procurement of the instrument, a purchaser might take delivery with only minimal formality. Essentially, the instrument would be given an identification number and an instrument code, both being stored in the memory 56A and a related one of the cells 70A1-n. A prepaid amount would be paid and recorded in the assigned cell. Basic owner data also may be required and stored in the group of fields 206 (FIG. 5); otherwise, complications are minimal. The owner is not obligated for unlimited calls. Credit information or standing is unnecessary. Billing details are avoided. The complications are relatively few. The convenience is relatively good and the risk of loss is relatively small. The same features that render an instrument in accordance here with suitable for a young person also are present for numerous other applications. Specifically, reduced risk of loss, minor complications of ownership and considerable convenience for storage render such instruments practical for travelers, automotive use, employee assignment, pager users, and a host of others. In view of the detailed descriptions set out above, the structure and operation of the system to execute effective communication processes will be",
