            "Christianity became the state religion in the ancient city-state of Aksum kingdom, which is now Ethiopia.",
            "Aksum flourished. But from the 9th century, like all the other Christian kingdoms of North Africa and the Nile, Ethiopia was threatened by Islam. Christianity managed to survive due to Ethiopia's isolation.",
            "King Gadla Lalibela began to build grand churches in Lalibela.",
            "Political power in Ethiopia, ruled by fifteen puppet emperors went through a process of decentralization.",
            "Emperor Teodros II consolidated his authority and reunified the Ethiopian empire.",
            "Successive Ethiopian emperors from the Amhara and Tigre groups expanded the influence of their own peoples by securing territories occupied by other ethnic groups. Since the mid-1800s, the emperor's army had erected ketemas, garrison towns, to rule Oromo and Somali areas. Political authorities imposed the Amhara-Christian culture upon those residing in ketemas in the southern periphery and extracted resources from them.",
            "Italy expanded its colonial sphere to include most of what is now Eritrea.",
            "In the Treaty of Ucciali, Emperor Menelik accepted Italy's colonization of Eritrea. During the 19th century, Ethiopia had joined the Great Powers (i.e., Britain, France, and Italy) and had expanded its territory beyond Gondar and Shoa to include the Ogaden.",
            "The war between Italy and Ethiopia (after Menelik rejected to agree to an Italian protectorate over all of Ethiopia and renounced the Treaty of Ucciali) resulted in an Ethiopian victory at the battle of Adwa.",
            "The current boundaries of Ethiopia were established. Four successive emperors (until the overthrow of Emperor Haile Selassie I by a military coup in 1974) built and consolidated their power.",
            "Haile Selassie I became Emperor. Under his regime, the country's major economic resource was coffee produced mostly in peripheral Oromo areas. The relations between Amhara-Tigre landlords and Oromo tenants had become set. A similar pattern was established in the Afar and Somali-residing Ogaden region for large-scale government-run agribusiness schemes.",
            "Italian Fascist Mussolini conquered Ethiopia. Haile Selassie was exiled.",
            "After the collapse of Mussolini, the British military administration was established in Eritrea. British armies liberated Ethiopia and restored Haile Selassie to his throne. Haile Selassie had successfully repressed ethnic sentiments for self-determination of the Oromos, Somalis, and Afar and reconsolidated his authority.",
            "Ethiopia was joined in a federation with Eritrea (former Italian colony) by the United Nations. However, Haile Selassie abrogated the federation and attempted to unify Ethiopia and Eritrea under his control within the next ten years.",
            "The Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF), mostly consisting of Muslim separatist, was formed in Cairo by students and workers.",
            "The ELF launched an open rebellion in western Eritrea, armed with weapons brought in from Sudan.",
            "Haile Selassie had the Eritrean Assembly dissolve the federal executive and integrate Eritrea fully into Ethiopia.",
            "Three groups split away from the ELF and established the Eritrean Peoples Liberation Front (EPLF).",
            "The Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) was formed. The legitimacy of the Haile Selassie regime was widely challenged as the country's economy fell into disarray and patterns of inequality persisted.",
            "Emperor Haile Selassie was deposed by revolutionary Marxist-Leninist military leaders.",
            "The monarchy was abolished by the armed forces. Rebellion in Eritrea gathered momentum. The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) was established.",
            "A Marxist military regime, the Derg (Amharic for Committee) was formally established in Addis Ababa. The Derg advanced no policies to accommodate minority groups.",
            "Lieutenant Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam seized power after an internal struggle within the military leadership.",
            "Relations between Ethiopia and the United States were severed when the Mengistu regime turned to the Soviet Union for military aid. Several groups opposed the regime because of ideological and political differences. The country was severely challenged by nationalist movements and rebellions in Eritrea and in the Ogaden between 1976 and 1978.",
            "Drought and war with Eritrea caused one of Africa's worst famines. Millions died in spite of massive food and medical aid from Europe and America.",
            "The Workers' Party of Ethiopia (WPE) was set up in order to control politics and to legitimize Mengistu's policies. Although the WPE was declared to promote democracy and popular participation in party activities, no ethnic groups were represented among the mass organizations constituting the WPE. Those who raised nationality issues were labeled anti-revolutionaries. The feudal land tenure system was dissolved under the Mengistu regime. All rural and most urban land became the property of the state. For the first phase of the Mengistu regime, there were dramatic enhancements in formal educational opportunities (the illiteracy rate dropped from 90 percent to less than 40 percent) and health care. The country's economy experienced slight improvement during the middle years of the Mengistu regime, but, between 1980 and 1988 agricultural production had declined by 0.4 percent per year. The last days of the Mengistu regime manifested the patterns of inequality of the imperial regime.",
            "A civilian (Marxist-Leninist) Constitution was introduced, proclaiming the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (PDRE). The PDRE was led by an 835-member National Shengo (assembly) which aided Mengistu in consolidating his power.",
            "The Shengo initiated regional reorganization by creating 24 administrative regions and five autonomous regions (Eritrea, Assab, Dire Dawa, Tigre, and Ogaden) in order to deflect nationalist discontent. The government's genuine intention to grant autonomous status to Assab and Dire Dawa (the country's two economic cores) was to separate them from the regions of Eritrea and Ogaden. Most nationalist movements such as EPLF, TPLF, and OLF dismissed the PDRE's initiative and began to coordinate military strategy to increase their anti-government activities.",
            "The Mengistu regime faced another major drought and intensified ethno-nationalist movements. When Mengistu was informed that the Soviet Union would soon stop providing military aid, he declared a state of emergency.",
            "Mengistu announced reform policies to promote private sector investment.",
            "The TPLF (led by Meles Zenawi) organized the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), a coalition of rebel forces against the Mengistu regime.",
            "The OLF, EPLF, and EPRDF cooperated amongst themselves. Soldiers who defected from Mengistu's army after the abortive coup and prisoners of wars were recruited to the organizations. The EPRDF created the Oromo People's Democratic Organization (OPDO), its own Oromo affiliate, and established other organizations representing various ethnic groups. The EPRDF rejected Marxist slogans, advocated pragmatic policies, and encouraged close military and political cooperation with the TPLF and EPLF.",
            "While Mengistu was visiting East Germany in search of military aid, there was a coup attempt in Addis Ababa. Mengistu hastily returned and brutally put down the coup. Some army units defected and took their arms with them to join opposition forces.",
            "The WPE's new economic policy aimed to end the country's centrally planned economy and initiate a mixed economy of state, private, and cooperative. Yet it appeared to be too late to revive the country's economy. Moreover, civil wars aggravated the quality of life. Mengistu, as did emperor Haile Selassie, failed to address the nationalities problem. The number of Ethiopian soldiers increased to more than 500,000 by 1990, but Ethiopian forces rapidly declined in military position. The TPLF and the EPRDF took over the entire Tigre region and large parts of Wollo, Gondar, and Shoa. The EPLF controlled all towns in Eritrea except Asmara, Massawa, and Assab. The United States attempted to negotiate peace between Ethiopia and the EPLF while the Italian government tried to arrange talks between Ethiopia and the TPLF.",
            "An all-parties peace conference for Ethiopia was planned in London, but the EPRDF advanced within 23 miles of the capital, Addis Ababa. The EPLF captured Massawa and closed in on Asmara.",
            "Herman Cohen, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African affairs, secured Mengistu's exile to Zimbabwe. Before his flight, Mengistu had appointed a new prime minister, Tesfaa Dinka, for the London peace talks.",
            "Herman Cohen convened peace talks in London between the rebels and the Ethiopian regime. A cease-fire agreement was reached by all parties. Prime Minister Tesfaa Dinka boycotted the talks to oppose Cohen's approval for the rebels to enter Addis Ababa in spite of the cease-fire agreement. There was a massive airlift of 16,000 Ethiopian Jews.",
            "The EPRDF, many of its members teenagers, captured Addis Ababa against little resistance from the government army of more than half a million. Subsidiary organizations within the EPRDF, such as the TPLF, the OPDO, the Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement (EPDM), and the Ethiopian Democratic Officers Revolutionary Movement (EDORM), were expected to play a key part in the new Ethiopian state. In Eritrea, the EPLF captured the cities of Asmara and Assab.",
            "After its victory, the EPRDF (led by Meles Zenawi) held a national conference and established the Transitional Government of Ethiopia (TGE), seeking to form a broad-based political pact. A transitional charter was adopted by a multiparty conference and was to remain in force until the general election scheduled for 1993. An 87-member Council of Representatives elected by the conference confirmed Meles Zenawi as transitional President. The OLF, the Afar Liberation Front (ALF), and several Somali organizations agreed to join the pact. But former members of the WPE and Mengistu's followers, radical leftist groups including the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party (EPRP) and the All-Ethiopian Socialist Movement, and some conservative Ethiopian nationalist groups such as the Coalition of Ethiopian Democratic Forces (COEDF), opposed the EPRDF leadership. The TGE included an ethnically mixed council of seventeen ministers representing seven ethnic groups. The EPRDF had the largest single bloc in the Council of Representatives while the OLF was the second largest. The Council was given the authority to establish a commission which would draw up a draft constitution. In Oromo areas, the OLF had expanded the ranks of its military (eight thousand in 1991) by recruiting the members from the areas heavily occupied by the Oromo and former soldiers of Mengistu's army.",
            "In preparation for the elections, the Council declared the encampment of all armed groups, designating them (including the EPRDF) to serve as an interim national army and to provide police services. Armed conflicts erupted between the EPRDF and Oromo members in the Oromo region. The EPLF at Makele attempted to arrange talks between the EPRDF and the OLF.",
            "An encampment accord was made between the EPRDF and the OLF. The National Electoral Commission (NEC), consisting of ten multi-ethnic members drawn from the Council, was founded to establish local administrations with broad ethnic and political representation. As the date for the regional and local elections approached in the early summer of 1992, ethnic tensions intensified. Following the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Oromia (IFLO), which had withdrawn from the elections earlier, the All-Amhara People's Organization (AAPO), the Ethiopian Democratic Action Group (EDAG), the Gideo People's Democratic Organization (GPDO), and the OLF also withdrew. Approximately 50-60 percent of the voting-age population refused to participate in the elections. The NEC had to postpone the elections in many areas and yet the elections went ahead as planned on June 21, 1992. The OLF decamped and broke into small units which triggered the resumption of civil war.",
            "The number of registered political parties swelled to over two hundred, but only a few had a sizable number of members. The OLF withdrew from the government (the Council of Representatives).",
            "President Meles officially abolished press censorship, but several provisions in the new law allowed the government ample routes to informally censor the media and to harass journalists.",
            "The TGE made appointments to the country's first independent judiciary. Political and economic reforms have attracted great favor from foreign donors. To reduce the nationalities problem, Meles announced that his government would form a multi-ethnic national army. Popular discontent by those opposed to the TGE's policy and those favoring ethnically based secession for certain groups continued to run high. However, the insurrection was largely contained.",
            "President Meles confirmed that multi-party legislative elections would not take place until 1994. The transitional period scheduled to end in 1993 was extended.",
            "Eritrea declared independence following the referendum. The TGE and the Provisional Government of Eritrea (PGE) maintained cooperative relationships. Meles ousted five political groups (who called themselves the Southern Coalition and pressed for a dissolution of the Council of Representatives) from the Council.",
            "The EPRDF appeared to be experiencing its most serious internal crisis since assuming power in May 1991.",
            "The Council issued a decree relating to elections for a constituent assembly which barred members of the WPE from participating. The Council also excluded all former security personnel and ex-soldiers who had not completed the national rehabilitation program. During late 1993, the governing coalition narrowed substantially.",
            "The TGE allowed a conference on peace and reconciliation organized by approximately 50 internal and exiled opposition groups. But seven participants from abroad, including the two leading figures of the exiled OLF, were arrested (and then released in January 1994). The TGE itself boycotted the conference.",
            "The TGE attempted to implement a policy which respected the languages and cultures of historically oppressed minorities and allowed them a certain amount of regional autonomy based upon their ethnic affinities. Therefore, the TGE created fourteen new regions. A region consisted of several districts (woreda, the basic unit of national and regional autonomous government). The Oromo's region is the largest (220 woreda out of 600 for federated Ethiopia), followed by Amhara (126), Tigre (62), and Somali (47). While the TGE controlled defense, foreign affairs, economic policy, and citizenship, the law enabled the new regional governments to have broad political powers. Still, the EPRDF clearly declared that regional autonomy should be guaranteed only within the framework of a unified, federated Ethiopia. Neither the aspirations of ethnic groups for their rights to self-determination nor ethnic tensions, however, were appeased by this new policy. For instance, some Oromo people, including members of the OLF, increased their demands for the creation of an independent state of Oromia.",
            "The Constitutional Assembly was selected in an election boycotted by non-EPRDF parties. Despite the TGE's promise to include many groups in the assembly, the Amhara and Oromos continued to be poorly represented. The charter articulated the right of each nationality to govern its own affairs within the context of a federated Ethiopia by establishing autonomous regions based upon ethnic identities. Yet, human rights violations by the TGE were continually reported. The heightened ethnic tensions (often with low-intensity civil war) slowed the constitution-making process. Multi-party elections to install a new democratic government were delayed indefinitely.",
            "A new constitution, which restructured Ethiopia into nine ethnically-based federated states with a national parliament, was ratified by the country's constituent assembly. This was the result of long-term negotiations which began in 1991 following the collapse of the Mengistu regime. The TGE had strengthened the economy with free market policies since 1992.",
            "An estimated 250,000 people staged a demonstration in Addis Ababa in support of the new constitution. However, opposition groups said that they would not approve a new constitution.",
            "The State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1995 reported Ethiopia continued on the road to democracy in 1995 with the holding of national and regional election in May and June. A new constitution was adopted in December 1994. The military continued low-level operations to counter armed attacks by the OLF and IFLO (Islamic Front for the Liberation of Oromiya) throughout the year. The military, ONLF (Ogaden National Liberation Front), al-Itihad, OLF and IFLO were all reported to have committed summary executions during clashes in parts of Oromo and Somali states. The government continued to detain persons without charge. These included several hundred Oromo youth suspected of participating in the OLF armed campaign against the government.",
            "Ethiopian authorities ordered rival Muslim groups to stop fighting after 9 people were killed and 130 wounded in the Great Anwar mosque, the largest mosque in Addis Ababa. Violence erupted between two Muslim groups both claiming to be representatives of Ethiopia's Islamic Affairs Supreme Council. The authorities banned all marches in Addis Ababa for two weeks beginning February 24. Over 280 members of the outlawed Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) had been on trial at Zeway town, which was 120 miles south of Addis Ababa. They were accused of waging war against the interim government.",
            "A UN official said that more than 93,000 Ethiopian refugees living in Sudan, Djibouti, Somalia, and Kenya since 1991 would be repatriated this year. But the UNHCR said that no plan had been made to repatriate the 360,000 refugees from Somalia, Sudan, Djibouti, and Kenya living in Ethiopia.",
            "Nine Italian tourists on a camel trek on the Eritrean border with Ethiopia (where the fierce nomadic Afar people resided) were kidnaped for ransom by desert tribesmen. Ethiopia launched an intensive search for the tourists.",
            "The missing Italian tourists were released and arrived in Addis Ababa. No ransom was paid to secure their freedom. Claudio Pozzati, leader of the tourist group, thanked the Afar tribesmen who eventually handed them over to the Ethiopian military.",
            "Voters began registering for Ethiopia's first multi-party elections in May. The Amhara National Democratic Movement (ANDM), the Oromo People's Democratic Organization (OPDO), the Southern Ethiopian People's Democratic Union (SEPDU), and the TPLF, who ousted Mengistu and set up the TGE, were expected to dominate the elections. These groups had championed Eritrean independence and self-determination for all nationalities in a federal system for the multi-ethnic state.",
            "The International Commission of Jurists accused Ethiopian leaders of suppressing political dissent and violating human rights. Between 1992 and 1994, thousands of government opponents were reported to be held without trial for expressing their political opinions.",
            "The ruling coalition won a landslide victory in the country's first multi-party general election. Many opposition parties boycotted the election because they claimed they were prevented from campaigning and some of their activists were detained. The OAU and Western diplomatic missions declared the elections to be free and fair.",
            "The leaders of Coalition of Alternative Forces for Peace and Democracy in Ethiopia (CAFPDE), an opposition coalition of more than 30 parties, including the OLF and the southern Ethiopian People's Democratic Coalition (SEPDC), boycotted and dismissed the elections as a sham. The CAFPDE refused the appeals of Western donors, particularly the United States, to join the elections, arguing that the elections only served the interests of the EPRDF. Three people were killed in the eastern town of Harar when a grenade was lobbed into a bar. Also, at least 15 people were killed and 10 wounded in the eastern town of Dire Dawa when a grenade exploded in a busy market frequented by ethnic Somalis. The eastern region of Ethiopia is a stronghold of Oromo and Ogadeni opposition parties which boycotted the polls and the site of a low intensity guerrilla war by ethnic militants.",
            "Elections in the Somali-speaking East and the Afar-dominated Northeast were postponed until May 27 because the government said there were logistical, rather than security, problems.",
            "Ethiopia held the first multi-party parliamentary elections in its 2000-year history. More than 15 million of Ethiopia's 55 million people registered to vote for a 550-seat national parliament and regional councils. Most opposition parties boycotted the election. More than 280 foreign monitors were present in Addis Ababa. As expected, President Meles Zenawi's EPRDF ruling coalition won by a landslide.",
            "The Organization of African Unity (OAU) said that the elections held in Ethiopia were free and fair. The state-run Ethiopian News Agency (ENA) reported that the Oromo People's Democratic Organization (OPDO) took 18 of the 20 constituencies for the federal parliament and regional council in the southern region of Bale and the western region of Illibabor, both Oromo strongholds.",
            "The Ethiopian News Agency said that the OLF in the eastern town of Harar dissolved its central committee and threw out leaders in exile in order to continue to stir violence in the Ogaden region.",
            "Elections scheduled for May 27 were delayed in the ethnic Somali and the Afar regions. External Economic Co-operation Minster Abdulmejid Hussein, the chairman of the Ethiopian Somali Democratic League (ESDL, a coalition of 14 groups), expressed disappointment over the polls delay. He observed that Somali-inhabited regions were more peaceful than Washington, D.C.",
            "Election results for the Afar and Harer (or Harar) regions were announced. In the Afar Region, APDO (Afar People's Democratic Organization) won seats for the federal parliament in five constituencies and ALFP (Afar Liberation Front Party) in four.

The Afars had to abandon their bases in the region as the government troops pushed them back along the Sabba Valley close to the Djibouti frontier.

There is growing fear that Ethiopia could slip into a bloody religious war, especially if its neighbors, such as Sudan, continue to encourage extremist elements within Ethiopia and the region. Both Ethiopia and Eritrea accuse Sudan of supporting Islamic rebels trying to overthrow their governments and both Ethiopia and Eritrea have given support to rebels in Sudan trying to overthrow the government of al-Bashir.

The Ethiopian government decided to reduce its Eritrean Embassy staff and close its consular offices in Tigray and Afar regions. The border dispute has led to 126,000 people being displaced in Tigray region.
