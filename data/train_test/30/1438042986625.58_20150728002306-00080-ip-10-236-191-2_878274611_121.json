There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, it\u2019s because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if you\u2019re looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and it\u2019s surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",

Most of the classes are small enough that you'll feel right at home in no time and know all of your classmates and professors well. On weekends, you'll most likely party at night and visit downtown LA or the beach on weekends. There's so much to do both on campus and off that you'll never be bored. Despite the rumor that USC is full of stuck-up rich kids, this is NOT true. USC has some of the most friendly and cool people you'll ever meet. There isn't a particular stereotype for students, so everyone fits in! Trust me, you'll love USC if you like having fun and don't mind working hard. Tips for prospective students Do as much as possible in high school!! Make the most of all the opportunities because they really make an application competitive! Take lots of AP classes and work hard to keep up your grades. APs also help out to save you credits (and money!) in college if you do well enough on the exams. Participate in lots of activities: go out for a sports team, yearbook, student government, etc... anything and EVERYTHING looks good. Volunteer as much as possible - even if it's",
