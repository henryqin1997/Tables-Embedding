This is a touch confusing on the Java side, which is littered with odd autoincrement statements to skip over these terminators. I believe the reason this was done was to allow the C code to be extra efficient when reading strings which the servlet container is sending back -- with the terminating \\0 character, the C code can pass around references into a single buffer, without copying. if the \\0 was missing, the C code would have to copy things out in order to get its notion of a string. not include the trailing '\\0' -- it is like A variable-sized string (length bounded by 2^16). Encoded with the length packed into two bytes first, followed by the string (including the terminating '\\0'). Note that the encoded length does String 0 to 2^16 (32768).",
