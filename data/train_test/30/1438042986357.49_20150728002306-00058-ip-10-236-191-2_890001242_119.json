            "Campus security is top notch and readily available. You never feel unsafe, even at night. There is very little crime on the campus.",
            "Sadly, the greek life is very poor. There are only a handful of sororities and fraternities available and you hardly hear about them. Nor do they house the fun greek parties every university loves to attend.",
            "A wide variety of clubs are available from biology club (which I'm currently a member), skate club, classical movie club, literally anything you can think of!",
            "Anyone who is adventurous and likes trying new things, this campus is perfect for you. You will never be bored because there is always something new and exciting going on!",
            "Hawaiian culture and traditions are very interesting and the campus works hard to incorporate things such as a local farmer's market or festivals.",
            "Being an out of state student, I think I pay a little more than what I am receiving, but there is a lot to be offered.",
            "You're only 2 miles from the nearest beach! A bus pass is also included in your tuition so it is helpful in getting you around the island. There is always something fun to be done between hitting up the beach, hiking in the valleys, snorkeling, surfing, kayaking ( I could go on forever..)",
            "You'll find an array of diversity of eats on and off campus.",
            "The dorms are small and very hot given the location of Hawaii and no central air conditioning.",
            "The academic classes are very rigorous, but tutoring is readily offered and available.",
            "If you plan on attending this university, make sure you have a stable financial situation. Not only is the tuition expensive, the cost of living is very, very high.",
            "The campus is centrally located between the heart of Oahu - Waikiki, and the beautiful Manoa valley. There is currently a lot of construction taking place on campus which is rather distracting. The campus offers a lot of opportunities for you to get involved in the community."

You should have a warm-climate preference and love beaches and sun. Perfect for someone who's hard-working and a self-starter, but still likes to have a good time and meet new people. Pack the bikini or swim trunks but leave the snow pants at home. No mama's boys or shy girls who need their parents every minute need apply. Time to put your big boy or girl pants on and show everyone what you can do on your own. A good time and lots of opportunity awaits. Tips for prospective students There are lots of things to consider before choosing University of Hawaii. Transportation issues are one of the big ones. You cannot drive your car here and although the public transportation (bus) system is pretty good, you have to factor that in. Also",
