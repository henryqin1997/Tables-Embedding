Available in Apache HTTP Server 2.3.10 and later., 41170=When RewriteRule is used in VirtualHost or server context with version 2.2.22 or later of httpd, mod_rewrite will only process the rewrite rules if the request URI is a URL-path. This avoids some security issues where particular rules could allow \"surprising\" pattern expansions (see CVE-2011-3368 and CVE-2011-4317). To lift the restriction on matching a URL-path, the AllowAnyURI option can be enabled, and mod_rewrite will apply the rule set to any request URI string, regardless of whether that string matches the URL-path grammar required by the HTTP specification. Available in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.3 and later., 43263=In versions 2.4.13 and later, when a relative substitution is made in directory (htaccess) context and RewriteBase has not been set, this module uses some extended URL and filesystem context information to change the relative substitution back into a URL. Modules such as mod_userdir and mod_alias supply this extended context info. This option disables the behavior introduced in 2.4.13 and should only be set if all of the conditions above are present and a substituion has an unexpected result., 67120=Copyright 2015 The Apache Software Foundation.

Flags is a comma-separated list, surround by square brackets, of any of the flags in the following table. More details, and examples, for each flag, are available in the Rewrite Flags document. By default, the query string is passed through unchanged. You can, however, create URLs in the substitution string containing a query string part. Simply use a question mark inside the substitution string to indicate that the following text should be re-injected into the query string. When you want to erase an existing query string, end the substitution string with just a question mark. To combine new and old query strings, use the [QSA] flag. Modifying the Query String Rewrite rules are applied to the results of previous rewrite rules, in the order in which they are defined in the config file. The URL-path or file-system path (see \"What is matched?\", above) is completely replaced by the Substitution and the rewriting process continues until all rules have been applied, or it is explicitly terminated by an L flag, or other flag which implies immediate termination, such as END or F. Back-references are identifiers of the form $N (N=0..9), which will be replaced by the contents of the Nth group of the matched Pattern. The server-variables are the same as for the TestString of a RewriteCond directive. The mapping-functions come from the",
