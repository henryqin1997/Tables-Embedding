The 290X is a god send it made Nvidia have to adjust there prices and that is more important then anything. If it was not for Amd you would be paying 1200 for that 780GTX TI. Amd gives us 780 GTX performance for 399.00 with R290 while Nvidia gave it to us for 649.00 with the GTX 780. The 290x is the future with some tweaking it will be the card of the future. With Ultra HD 4k on the horizon the extra memory will come into play and again Nvidia keeps sticking it to its customers by giving us 3 gb instead of 4gb or 6 gb like the titan which is what this card will need in 4k game play. That G-sync is a joke since none of the top Monitors provide it. I bet you ran the 290x in quiet mode. You did not even use the new drivers from AMD betas 9.2 also. Amd\u2019s mantle will also improve the gaming experience and with all the game manufactures programing for the AMD chips since all the game systems use them now it will leave NVidia out in the cold. I\u2019m not a Fan boy of either but will give credit will credit is due Nvidia Has given game players the shaft for a while with over priced video cards and we can thank AMD for giving NVidia a reality check. Thank you AMD for not fucking us like Nvidia has for along time with over priced video cards. I also own a over price EVGA classified 780 GTX card. You got once NVidia never again waiting for 290x Asus matrix that will be a hot video card., 44671=8 November 2013 at 6:47 AM (UTC -7) Link to this comment, 41269=Hmm \u2026 it looks like: \u2013 It beats the Titan handily (unless the 3gb of VRAM runs out) \u2013 At lower resolutions, and more important at 2560\u00d71440 it beats the 290X}",

    "textBeforeTable": "The temperatures illustrated below are absolute maximum values, and do not represent real-world temperatures created by video games or graphics applications: Using a modified version of FurMark\u2019s \u201cTorture Test\u201d to generate maximum thermal load, peak GPU temperature is recorded in high-power 3D mode. FurMark does two things extremely well: drives the thermal output of any graphics processor much higher than any video games realistically could, and it does so with consistency every time. Furmark works great for testing the stability of a GPU as the temperature rises to the highest possible output. This section reports our temperature results subjecting the video card to maximum load conditions. During each test a 20\u00b0C ambient room temperature is maintained from start to finish, as measured by digital temperature sensors located outside the computer system. GPU-Z is used to measure the temperature at idle as reported by the GPU, and also under load. GeForce GTX 780 Ti Temperatures These results position the GTX 780 Ti among the least power-hungry top-end video cards we\u2019ve tested under load, but much more impressive is that it\u2019s achieved by a flagship GTX-series product. If you\u2019re familiar with electronics, it will come as no surprise that less power consumption equals less heat output as evidenced by our thermal results below\u2026 Measured at the lowest reading, GeForce GTX 780 Ti consumed a mere 12W at idle. NVIDIA\u2019s average TDP is specified as 250W, however\u00a0our real-world stress tests using 3D Mark Vantage caused this video",
    "textAfterTable": "As we\u2019ve mentioned on the pages leading up to this section, NVIDIA\u2019s Kepler architecture yields a much more efficient operating GPU compared to previous designs. This becomes evident by the low idle temperature, and translates into modest full-load temperatures. While NVIDIA\u2019s reference design works exceptionally well at cooling the GK110 GPU on GeForce GTX 780 Ti, consumers should expect add-in card partners to advertise unnecessarily excessive over-cooled versions for an extra premium. 82\u00b0C after ten minutes at 100% load using Furmark\u2019s Torture Test is nothing at all, and is nowhere close to this card\u2019s 95\u00b0C thermal threshold (which the R9 290X could actually reach).
