            "UC's like many other colleges, can get a little pricy. However, a lot of the stuff we are paying for can be put to use! Try using the Gym facilities and take advantage of the free classes they offer! Also, try making it to the concerts they hold every quarter for us!",
            "A lot of people say that there is not a lot to do in Riverside, but there are many things off and on campus that can help you pass the time in a fun way! For starters, hiking to the C was one of the most memorable times I had. We also have downtown Riverside, with many great places to eat. During the Holidays, they have the Festival of Lights, which is a great thing to explore with friends. On campus, we have the Botanic Gardens, which is a beautiful walk on a sunny day. There are also many plays and performances on campus, and if you're not into that, try out some intramural sports!",
            "Having a meal plan is very convenient. There is always hot food ready for you, and I loved that they would switch up the menus and the dining halls so often. The staff of the dining halls does a great job at keeping the facilities clean and always being friendly. As for other food on campus, the HUB has a great selection, and the chameleon food truck is always a great stop on the way back to the dorms or before class!",
            "Dorm life is fantastic! I lived in Pentland Hills residence halls and I made some of the best memories of my life there. The dorms are very clean, comforting, and the best way to make friends. The R.A's are helpful and friendly and the people you will meet in the dorms can be the friends of a lifetime. I definitely recommend living in the dorms for incoming freshmen. You will not regret it!",
            "The courses at UCR can be tough, after all, it is a University! The great thing about UCR is that they have many resources available to you. Office hours, the Academic Resource Center, peer mentors, etc. The courses are tough and being on a quarter system does make time fly by and course load a little harder, but it is definitely fair and doable.",
            "Visit the campus first and see if you feel like it clicks for you. If you feel at home on the campus, like I did when I first visited, the right choice should not be very hard! Get a good feel for where you could possibly be spending the next four years of your life!",
            "One of the most friendly campuses I have ever stepped foot on. Faculty, staff, and students really make you feel at home. People are dedicated to learning and helping others in a passionate and personal way."

The city has a diverse selection of foods from American food, to Thai food, Indian food, Vietnamese food, etc and Asahi which is one of the most delicious All-You-Can-Eat restaurants around. May I add that these places are legit and not Americanized. Since it's really hot you can go swimming all the time. Some people hike the C which is a C on the top of a mountain. You can join clubs like Surf Club (they take you surfing) or outdoor excursions (they take you on countless trips). A lot of people also spend time at the gym playing intramurals., 473889=There's not too many unusual traditions I know of besides the school priding itself of its Scottish heritage through an occasional bagpipe practice every now and then, that can be heard from the residence halls. Our concerts held every school quarter have been traditions for many years, welcoming notable artists such as J.Cole, Lupe Fiasco, Nas, Mac Miller, Karmin, The Roots, Common, Kendrick Lamar, Chiddy Bang, Dev & The Cataracs, and more who have blessed UCR with their presence at some point in time. Being that our Botanical Garden is apart of the UCR campus, its not too unusual of a place, but definitely one that's uniquely beautiful., 686211=There has been a string of robberies on and near campus since January of 2013 . Students have been targeted for technology. Lap tops, I-Pads, and Smart Phones have been taken by force. The school has been scrutinized in the local newspaper as well a TV news cast. Escort services are available 24/7. The campus appears to be safe and tranquil, but I would not suggest walking in the surrounding community after dark alone. In all fairness, I would not walk around the part of Riverside I live in after dark alone either., 932456=Taking AP classes in high school and don't get lower than a B and you will have the GPA you need. Assuming of course that you absolutely do not fail any classes. From there, take the SAT or ACT a couple times and try to get above 1750 and you will be good to go., 691643=Admissions office considers the entire package- strength of transcript, SAT and SAT subject exam scores, and extracurriuluars all play a role in the decision making process. UCR had over 40,000 students apply for admission for the fall of 2013. For many students, UCR is a first choice rather than a backup school., 657457=Some days are better than others. Sometimes they have themes such a Cajun night or Thanksgiving Dinner and those nights the food is amazing. I personally liked the Dining Halls and as a student who no longer lives on campus I miss them., 513159=Lothian resident, Nicer than A-I, Pentland Hill is really nice but expensive. People at AI are more down to earth at least when I went there. Lothian people tend to be a bit clicky. Still both are expensive because of meal plan. May find a better deal off campus., 877551=They have limited greek life and the sororities/fraternities they do have are mostly community service based. On the up side, this means they cost only about 40 to 50 dollars a year instead of $2000 a quarter., 518259=2011-2012 school year we burned UC Irvine's mascot, the Anteater. That was really amusing and a great experience. We had fireworks shoot out from the buildings' rooftops to give a spectacular show., 1088951=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students UCR is great for students who like diversity and at the same time aren't afraid to go a little far from home, because UC Riverside is only an hour an a half from Los Angeles and not that far from San Diego either. At the same time, UCR is great for students who like to explore their majors through the different colleges that Riverside offers and meet great, new people everywhere you go. Tips for prospective students For students picking out a school or want to attend UC Riverside, I suggest that you work hard and look for a school that gives you a good financial aid packet. At the same time, how like Riverside the campus is diverse and has many opportunities for students. In addition, to check out the school and the location that it is located. Bang for the buck UCR has different opportunities to be able to receive financial aid through work-study and finding an on-campus job. It is a worthwhile school and offer scholarships. Am enjoying being here Living in the dorms and meeting new people make it a great experience to be in UCR. I like it because you are",
