The Devils late season surge, after an injury plagued early part of the year, has produced six wins and a draw in 8 rounds. The three feature games of round 19 will be played on the Sunday with big crowds expected at all three venues as teams look to cement finals positions. Competition leaders, Ipswich will play Norths at Bishop Park with Norths keen to continue their giant killing frame of mind, most notably last weekend?s defeat of Burleigh Bears in the ABC TV Game. At Piggabeen, Tweed Heads Seagulls host the North Queensland Young Guns and this match could go either way even though the Young Guns are out of finals contention. Tweed on the other hand are in fifth spot, one clear of Toowoomba and desperate to keep their foot in the door for the finals which start on August 30. The Seagulls are coming off a good win over Easts at Langlands Park.}",
