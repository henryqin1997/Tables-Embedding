In Alumni Hall, there is a small shop called Jazzman's. The main dining halls themselves are Upper and Lower Manser. Lower Manser is more select and strict, but their food is amazing. You can have your own choice of meal no matter the day. Upper Manser, on the other hand, changes their meals from day to day, meaning that your favorite food could show up maybe once in a week or two. However, Upper Manser is an All You Can Eat Buffet - once you are in, you are allowed to eat anything and everything you please. The downfall of Upper Manser is that it has set meal times and no breakfast, meaning that it doesn't open until lunch at 11:30 and then dinner at 4:30. Lower Manser is opened from early morning to late at night all week days. All of these locations do serve coffee., 62083=For prospective students of Mansfield University my number one tip would be to buy an umbrella! The campus is absolutely beautiful in all seasons, but for those not familiar with this area of the state, the weather can become pretty obnoxious at times. To be honest, one of the main reasons why I chose Mansfield is because of how great the campus looked. But walking from building to building in the pouring rain in November is no fun without proper rain protection. In all seriousness, I also advise prospective students to be sure to take advantage of all this University has to offer! Although we may be a small school in a slightly remote area, there is so much to do to be involved with campus life. They offer classes, organizations and fairs that will help you not only with college life but also with job applications, interviews, and skills you will need to start working in your career. A lot of new students will not take advantage of these opportunities, but hearing from graduates and even upperclassmen, I have learned that it is always better to seize every opportunity the University offers. And the best part is, most of these events are absolutely free. (Sometimes they will even give you shirts, and who doesn't want a free shirt?) My final words of advice are to go to the University homepage (www.mansfield.edu) and you will find questions to practically any question you want to ask. And if you can't, there is always someone who is just a short e-mail away from answering you., 101993=Many of the music majors participate in Ugly Sweater Week on campus in December., 210063=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
