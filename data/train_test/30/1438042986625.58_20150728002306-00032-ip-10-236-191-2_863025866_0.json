London-based enigma Aaron Jerome, aka the tribal mask-wearing producer/DJ SBTRKT (pronounced subtract), is the latest act to make the leap from FWD club staple to serious album artist with his self-titled debut, whose blend of warbling basslines and syncopated rhythms \u2014 with influences from the world of R&B, Chicago house, old-school garage, and synth pop \u2014 has provided what is, perhaps, dubstep's most genre-straddling effort to date. Signed to the XX's former label, Young Turks, and previously a remixer for the likes of M.I.A., the man of mystery may have some pretty indie credentials, but he's not afraid to embrace his more commercial side, particularly on two of the three female-fronted tracks, \"Wildfire,\" which sees Little Dragon's Yukimi Nagano playfully purr over a backdrop of Radio 1-friendly squelchy synths and languid beats, and the unashamedly retro \"Pharaohs,\" whose chopped up acid-house riffs perfectly complement emerging vocalist Roses Gabor's breathless tones. But it's in his more nocturnal offerings that the album is more in keeping with his maverick persona, as he effortlessly glides from twinkling electro to soulful skittering garage and back again on the angelic melodies of \"Sanctuary.\" He soundtracks the end of the night with the woozy synths and spacious rhythms of \"Trails of the Past,\" and reveals a refreshing vulnerability on the Chinese temple blocks, glockenspiels, and ambient electronica of \"Hold On,\" all of which are lavished with the plaintive, honey-layered vocals of Sampha. With such a sense of invention, a few hit-and-miss affairs, such as the self-indulgent knob-twiddling of \"Ready Set Loop\" and the early noughties Craig David remix feel of \"Never Never,\" are inevitable, but they're the only misfires on a record brimming with energy, vibrancy, and soul. SBTRKT's downtempo, mellow nature means it's a dance album that's unlikely to ever be played in a club, but showing James Blake that sparse, minimal dubstep and well-crafted pop melodies aren't mutually exclusive, it's a daring debut which lives up to the masked man's \"next big thing\" label. ~ Jon O'Brien, Rovi, 27725=Born: 2008 in London, England, 129044=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
