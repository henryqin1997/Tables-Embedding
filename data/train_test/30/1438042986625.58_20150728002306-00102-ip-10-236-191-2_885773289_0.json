The following example shows a sitemap entry for the URL http://example.com/sample.html, which contains two images. To give Google information about images on your site, you'll need to add image-specific tags to a\u00a0sitemap. You can use a separate sitemap to list images, or you can add image information to an existing sitemap. Use the method works for you! With Image Search, just as with Google Web Search, following\u00a0Webmaster Guidelines\u00a0and\u00a0best practices for publishing images\u00a0can increase the likelihood that your images can be found in Image Search results. Additionally, you can use Google image extensions for sitemaps to give Google more information about the images available on your URLs. Image sitemap information helps Google discover images we might not otherwise find (such as images your site reaches with JavaScript code), and allows you to indicate to Google images on your site that you want Google to crawl and index.
