            "Unless you go Greek or like to party, there isn't much to do on campus. I hate partying and drinking (yes, lots of people drink here in the middle Amish country) so I tend to play more video games & Apples to Apples, or go on Walmart runs with friends.",
            "Our dining hall/cafeteria usually has good stuff; you just got to be there at the right time. Tables fill up quickly.",
            "My first roommate was assigned to me based off a paper you fill out in the summer. She was great; we had a good first semester together. She transferred out before Christmas Break, so I had to get a new one. She was a mutual friend between me and my first roommate. This current one is awful and inconsiderate a lot. Another than that, the rooms aren't too bad and we have community bathrooms.",
            "Out of all of my classes so far for my first year, it was honestly like high school.",
            "There are religious undertones almost everywhere, so if you don't particularly like that then WC might not be for you. It doesn't bother me too much. Make sure you know what major you definitely want to be. Trying to change it is a hassle for some.",
            "It's a small, tight-knit college. The profs can be really interesting, but the older ones sometimes don't know what their doing. More often than not, everyone on campus is nice and will say hi if they've only seen you once before."

The professors are always in their offices waiting to give academic advice, proofread a paper, or to simply talk. In fact, most of my professors requested a one on one meeting just to get to know the students better. While some colleges have student professors, Westminster\u2019s professors are all highly acclaimed in their field, and they are extremely knowledgeable and capable of teaching students what they know. There are also free tutors on campus who are willing to proofread papers, help you understand a concept, or answer your questions. Knowing professors and peers are there to help makes it easy to succeed even in tough courses. This is probably why 98% of Westminster Graduates have a job or are enrolled in Grad School within a year of graduating., 118021=Go to first year events! they may sound stupid or lame (and they are), but they are also a great time to make friends. I made some of my best friends there! Also, get to know your RA on a 1:1 level, trust me they want to talk to you, and they've also probably got some experience with anything you are possibly going through., 138926=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Westminster College is an excellent campus for students who enjoy a friendly, exciting, and safe environment. Whether it's the students, professors, or faculty, everyone on campus will greet you with a warm smile. The college is also perfect for students who prefer a small campus. It is easy to know more people and to be known, and it's nearly impossible to get lost! There are many activities available on campus, whether you enjoy sports, music, or nature. In addition, it is also great for students who enjoy serving their community. The fraternities, sororities, and many of the other clubs provide students with opportunities to go out in the community and make a difference. The largest of these is the Habitat for Humanity group which renovates local homes. Since it is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church, there are many opportunities to get involved in Bible studies and worship groups; however, all of these are optional, so there is no pressure! Also, campus security enhances your experience at Westminster since you always feel safe on the small campus. Overall, almost anyone can find something to love about Westminster, whether it's the academics, activities, or environment. Tips for prospective students If Westminster College is the right choice for you, give it everything you have! Be sure to get involved. With so much to do, you are",
