            "Classes are small enough so you can get to know your professors pretty easily, and they are totally open to getting to know you. Decide your major early. What ever it is, they get you into the field during your freshman year. Don't feel like you have to live on campus, because there are alot of housing options close to the school. Get to class early if you don't want to walk a mile just to get a parking space. They are building new parking lots now, but there is also construction on Hanna Ave, right in front of the school so it kinda slows things down.",
            "The professors are GREAT! The classes teach you so much! The campus is small but big enough with lots of extras like the fitness center, free admission to almost everything held on campus, free tshirts and other junk, an awesome book store, textbook rentals, a lot of options for meal plans, and also the campus police for your safety!",
            "I am a commuter student, so it is harder for me to get involved in activities, events, and organizations, but they are all there for the taking. I have heard a lot of the older students and faculty say that they want you to feel like UIndy is your second home, so they do a lot to reach that goal. I myself am not very out going, but if you are or not, you still get to know a lot of people, and will get involved in more than you expect.",
            "I learn something every time I go to class. Since I am going full time, I, like a lot of you I'm sure, feel like skipping your 8:00 am class to sleep a little extra. But everytime I think about skipping I make myself go. And everytime I do go I learn something that will benefit me on my final. The professors are great and will do anything they can to help you learn all you can."

I am impressed with the nursing programs available and am looking forward to beginning my clinicals in August 2013., 49101=uindy is a great investment. they make it easy to get financial aid. the best thing is our student/faculty ratio. at 15:1 you have a teacher that can really care for you and actually be able to teach you. the quality of the education is one of the best in indiana., 280764=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 52689=the university of indianapolis is one of the best universities to attend in indiana. uindy, as the students call it, is a close knit community with around 5000 undergraduate students. the faculty really cares about the students, and with a of 15:1 student/teacher ratio the faculty is always available for the students., 29932=There are not too many activities offered on campus because of the campus being called a suitcase campus where people leave on the weekends. Clubs offer numerous volunteer opportunities that are extremely fun, from walking dogs at the animal shelter to playing with kids. This 2012-2013 year there have been weekend activities sponsored by our Residence Hall Association that have kept me on campus many weekends., 32473=The food is extremely good most days, there are occasional times when the food is a big questionable. You can always count on the grilled chicken and salad bar! There are many vegetarian options. The only problem are the dining hours on weekends which are very limited, but there are fast food places nearby. The dining hours have been extended this 2012-2013 academic year and I have no complaints:)}",

Tips for prospective students Don't be afraid to get to know your professors. It's really alright if they know your name. Also get involved on campus; there are many different opportunities available for you to use. Bang for the buck It might cost a more expensive, but it is definitely worth it. The professors are always willing to spend time with you and help you with problem material. Also there are many useful resources that are on campus that are available to students. These services include help services for job placement in the future, information concerning majors",
