Please note: all records are removed from their sealed packaging UNLESS REQUESTED OTHERWISE. Once removed from their packaging, they are kept in a 250g polysleeve which ensures protection. The record(s) and its sleeves are then placed between 2 stiffeners. This ensures that everything arrives exactly as you\u2019d want it to. We use top quality packaging materials - so all our items arrive with you, the buyer, in top notch condition.",
