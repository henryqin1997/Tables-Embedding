Furthermore, path diversity may be obtained by exploiting the multipath environment through spread spectrum processing by allowing a signal arriving with different propagation delays to be received and processed separately. Examples of path diversity are illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,101,501, issued Mar. 31, 1992, entitled \u201cSOFT HANDOFF IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM\u201d, and U.S. Pat.

    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes The previous description of the preferred embodiments is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make or use the present invention. The various modifications to these embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments without the use of the inventive faculty. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown herein but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and novel features disclosed herein. The base station sends a response message either accepting or rejecting the proposed promotion or demotion and in block 212 the mobile station 2 receives the response message. If the response indicates that the particular pilot under consideration should be promoted or demoted as proposed, then the control processor 62 recalculates the filter length NF in block 202 and the process continues. If the response indicates that the particular pilot under consideration should not be moved from one set population to another, the control processor 62 may skip block 202 and merely continue measuring the next pilot signal sample NEW_SAMPLE in block 204. In block 208, the filtered energy value XN is compared with the threshold TADD and TDROP to determine whether it should be promoted or demoted, respectively into another set population. For example, if the particular pilot being measured is determined to",
