            "Analysis",
            "The Tide rolled again (sorry for the lame joke) this time over Tennessee 45-10. This one was a blowout from the get go \u2013 Alabama led 35-0 at the half. After a few head scratching close wins over inferior opponents, Bama has kicked things into high gear. It\u2019s a bye week for the top ranked team, then the game we\u2019ve all been waiting for \u2013 versus LSU on November 9th.",
            "Slow start, strong finish. Stop me if you\u2019ve heard that before about an Oregon game. They were tied 14-14 at the half with UCLA, before blowing things open in the 2nd half for a 42-14 win. Oregon now gets a weekend off, before the game we\u2019ve had circled on our calendars since the off-season: at Stanford a week from Thursday.",
            "Poor Florida State. They absolutely demolished North Carolina State, 49-14 the final, but remained at the #3 spot in the polls. They\u2019ll have a chance to jump up this weekend though \u2013 with Oregon and Alabama off, the Seminoles face #6 Miami (FL) in Tallahassee.",
            "No one seems to be paying any attention to Ohio State, and rightfully so. Alabama, Oregon and Florida State are all playing so well \u2013 that they Buckeyes are an afterthought. But, since they played, I\u2019ll let you know how it went \u2013 OSU rolled Penn State 63-14. They\u2019re at Purdue on Saturday.",
            "The offense keeps on clicking, and the terrible defenses keep getting checked off the list for Baylor. It was 59-14 this weekend at Kansas, as Baylor improved to 7-0 and took over sole place atop the Big 12 standings. We\u2019ll find out if they\u2019re for real a week from Thursday when Oklahoma comes to town.",
            "Another close win for the Canes, resulted in them being bumped down a spot in the polls. A week after sneaking by North Carolina, Miami struggled with Wake Forrest this weekend. No more time to debate the Canes\u2019 though \u2013 they face Florida State on the road this weekend.",
            "Whew. Clemson almost pulled another Clemson, needing late game heroics to get past Maryland on the road. The Tigers are basically irrelevant at this point, needing two Florida State losses just to make it to the ACC Title game. But they\u2019ll look to keep any slim chances they have alive this Saturday, at Virginia.",
            "After losing a shocker on the road to Utah, Stanford has now put together back-to-back impressive wins. Saturday night, they caught ever break \u2013 knocking off Oregon State in Corvallis 20-12. Tickle me disappointed once again; their offense is about as anemic as they come. But they\u2019ll get a chance to prove me wrong a week from Thursday \u2013 when the #2 Ducks come to town.",
            "LSU played Furman. Seriously. They have a bye week this weekend, before traveling to take on #1 Alabama in Tuscaloosa.",
            "Auburn played Florida Atlantic. Seriously. But, they won and moved up in the polls. They\u2019ll get the train wreck that is Arkansas this Saturday.",
            "Oklahoma needed a good week, to further put the memories of an ass-whooping by Texas in their rearview mirror. They did just that \u2013 knocking Texas Tech from the unbeaten ranks, with a 38-30 win in Norman. They get another chance to knock off an undefeated team \u2013 a week from Thursday against Baylor.",
            "Johnny Manziel had another unreal game, continuing to build his case for a 2nd straight trip to New York \u2013 beating Vanderbilt 56-24. He\u2019ll put up more video game numbers this weekend, when the Aggies face UTEP.",
            "Oklahoma State played their best game in awhile this weekend, winning in dominant fashion 58-27 at Iowa State. The Cowboys travel to Texas Tech this Saturday, as the Red Raiders are coming off their first loss of the season.",
            "This was a game for the ages. Trailing 17-0 in the 4th quarter, Spurrior went back to Connor Shaw and the Gamecocks fought back, tying things at 17 a piece to force overtime. Missouri missed a chip shot field to tie the game \u2013 keeping South Carolina\u2019s hopes alive to make the SEC Title game. They face Mississippi State this weekend at home.",
            "Rinse and repeat. Hard to not feel bad for Missouri, leading 17-0 in the 4th quarter \u2013 they were on the brink of locking up a trip to the SEC Title game, and firmly placing themselves in the National Title conversation with three consecutive wins over ranked teams. Then, overtime happened. Missouri missed a chip shot field goal to tie the game, and their season potentially went up in flames. The Tigers look to pick up the pieces this weekend at home, against Tennessee.",
            "Another team that saw their dreams go up in flames this weekend \u2013 Texas Tech. After starting 7-0, and being one of the best stories in all of College Football, the Red Raiders fell 38-30 at Oklahoma this weekend. They have an immediate shot at redemption, though, when Oklahoma State comes to town Saturday.",
            "Louisville still playing, so I guess we have to talk about it? They bounced back from a dreadful loss to UCF, beating South Florida 34-3. The Cardinals play winless Uconn a week from Friday.",
            "Michigan had the weekend off, benefiting from attrition and moving up two spots in the poll. Huge game for the Wolverines Saturday \u2013 needing a marquee win, they travel to Michigan State Saturday.",
            "Man do I love this team. The offense is atrocious, but the Spartans belong in the conversation for best defense in the country. They did it again on Saturday, mopping the floor with Illinois to the tune of 42-3. There are still doubters \u2013 and rightfully so. But Michigan State has their shot at a statement win, when arch rival Michigan comes to town Saturday.",
            "Central Florida debuts in the \u201cDirty Poll\u201d after a 62-17 win over winless Uconn. After a weekend off, they welcome in 6-1 Houston.",
            "Northern Illinois continued to make their argument to be a BCS buster for the second straight year, beating Eastern Michigan 59-20 Saturday. They travel to take on Massachusetts Saturday (which won\u2019t help their BCS chances).",
            "Whoa. Close call for the Bulldogs, needing OT to beat San Diego State on the road, 35-28. They\u2019re battling with Northern Illinois to get a BCS invite, as they welcome in Nevada Saturday.",
            "Kudos to the Bruins \u2013 a week after being embarrassed by Stanford, they gave everything they had against #2 Oregon (tied 14-14 at the half) before being dismantled in the 2nd half. Brett Hundley has been a major disappointment, mustering only 64 passing yards against Oregon and tossing two picks. The good news? The Bruins get Colorado at home this weekend.",
            "The Badgers had the weekend off \u2013 they travel to face Iowa this Saturday.",
            "Hey there, Irish! Welcome back into the \u201cDirty Poll!\u201d A 45-10 win over Air Force, putting Notre Dame at 6-2 on the year\u2026 Check that, make it 7-2 with Navy this coming weekend."
