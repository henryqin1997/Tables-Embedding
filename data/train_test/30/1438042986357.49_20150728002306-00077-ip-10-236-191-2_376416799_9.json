I am able to run this at night with some reduction in light which slows my speeds down to probably a more appropriate night speed. The actual speed limit instead of a little above. Works good in daytime and looks BA. Switching shields is a matter of seconds once you get the hang of it. A rather simple, tool less design that works surprisingly well. Finding the finish to be very durable. I do handle all my helmets somewhat carefully watching out for ways to not scratch the shields. If you are going for pure light reduction a, smoke shield may be better suited for that. I was going for a certain look when riding and this accomplished that. The silver is also more reflective making me somewhat more visible as an unintended benefit. Cons: does not cut down light as much as I had thought. Pros: has mirrored look Recommended by Reviewer: Yes WA Stryder \u00a0 What you can handle - This review is for",
