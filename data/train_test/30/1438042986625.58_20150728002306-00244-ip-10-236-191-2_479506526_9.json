The next race available for wagering at each racetrack and its corresponding post time are preferably listed adjacent to each track name. For example, the next available race at the Pimlico racetrack is race 3, which has a post time of 1:56. As with the available racetracks, the list of which races are scheduled is preferably provided to user terminals 122 (FIG. 1) by distribution facility 120 (FIG. 1).

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations One skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention may be practiced by other than the described embodiments, which are presented for purposes of illustration and not of limitation, and the present invention is limited only by the claims that follow. Any suitable display can be used to present the user with the menu options of step 596 (FIG. 34). In the example of screen 598, the options available for each race appear in bold type, whereas unavailable options appear only faintly. For example, race 1 and race 2 have already been run. Accordingly, results 608 and 610 appear in bold type. Races 3 and 4 have not yet been run so alerts 612 and 614 and tape/VCR 616 and 618 appear in bold. Different options are available for races that have not yet been run. For example, the user can select \"alert\" at step 596 (FIG. 34) to be alerted (e.g., by an audible tone and/or a visual prompt on the display screen) that the race is about to be run. If alert is selected at step 596 (FIG. 34), user terminal 370 (FIG. 30) triggers an alarm and displays the race video when appropriate at step 604 (FIG. 34). The user can also select \"tape/VCR\" at step 596 (FIG. 34). If \"tape/VCR\" is selected at step 596 (FIG. 34), at step 606 (FIG. 34) user terminal 370 (FIG. 30) programs video recorder",
