No. 3,935,857 to Co discloses a cardiac catheter which is alleged to be useful in both right coronary and left coronary selective arteriography. On the other hand, Dr. Melvin P. Judkins in Chapter 7 of Coronary Arteriograhy and Anqiolasty 1985 (McGraw-Hill) discloses differently shaped catheters for right coronary and left coronary selective arteriography.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Numerous variations, within the scope of the appended claims, will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description and accompanying drawings. These variations are merely illustrative. Note that with catheter 43, there is no need for the user to accurately rotate the catheter to ensure proper placement. Nor is there any significant danger of the catheter diving into the right coronary artery since the configuration of the tip portion prevents over-insertion of the catheter. The actual placement of catheter 43 is illustrated in FIGS. 4A-4C. As shown in FIG. 4A, the tip portion 45 of catheter 43 is inserted through the aorta to a position within the ascending aorta 19 where the distal tip of the catheter is disposed above the ostium 25A of right coronary artery 25 with the end of the tip touching the inner wall of ascending aorta 19 above the ostium. This insertion is preferably performed using a guide wire that straightens the preformed curvature of tip portion 45 during insertion through the descending aorta and aortic arch into the ascending aorta. The guide wire is retracted to allow tip portion 45 to assume its preformed curvature. The tip portion 45 is then oriented so that the end of the tip portion is pointed toward and in contact with the right inner wall 20 of the ascending aorta, as shown in FIG. 4A for example. The",
