He had 14 points in 38 games for the Ducks and became an unrestricted free agent. He joined Guerin and the Islanders in the summer of 2008, where the close friends tried to rejuvenate a struggling team., 11867=When Weight and the Islanders finished at the bottom of the NHL standings in 2008-09, it led to them being awarded the No. 1 pick at the 2009 NHL Draft. They used it to select center John Tavares, who has developed into one of the premier players in the sport., 17929=Weight also had the privilege of representing his country at three Winter Olympics (1998, 2002, 2006). He helped the U.S. win the silver medal on its own soil in 2002, when the tournament was held in Salt Lake City. Weight had three assists in six games., 20684=Weight is yet another talented center to be entering the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame, joining the likes of some of his idols, including fellow Michigan native Pat LaFontaine, a 2003 inductee who entered the NHL when Weight was 13. But Weight knows he never would be in this position without the help of two very important people in his life., 16145=Just prior to the 2006 Torino Olympics, Weight was faced with one of the biggest decisions of his career. Then a member of the Blues, Weight had a no-trade clause. He was 35 at the time and had yet to win a Stanley Cup. But Carolina wanted him. Karmanos, who owned the club, and Hurricanes general manager Jim Rutherford felt Weight was the missing piece., 15772=Weight was provided with an opportunity to waive his no-trade clause in exchange for a chance to win the trophy that had eluded him since he entered the League in 1991. He accepted. A few months later, he was on the ice in Carolina with his family, celebrating his first NHL title. The Hurricanes beat one of Weight's former teams, the Oilers, in a wild seven-game series., 19573=Like several other players who have been inducted in recent years, one of Weight's biggest contributions was his role on the team that upset Canada at the 1996 World Cup of Hockey. After dropping Game 1 of the best-of-three final round in overtime in Philadelphia, the Americans earned back-to-back victories in Montreal to win the tournament. Weight had three goals and four assists in seven games., 22249=Weight, 42, is part of a class that also includes one of his closest friends, Bill Guerin, along with Cindy Curley, Peter Karmanos, Jr. and Ron Mason. Weight played for six teams in the NHL (New York Rangers, Edmonton Oilers, St. Louis Blues, Carolina Hurricanes, Anaheim Ducks and the Islanders) and had 278 goals and 755 assists in 1,238 games. He added another 23 goals and 49 assists in 97 Stanley Cup Playoff games and helped the Hurricanes win the franchise's lone championship in 2006., 10720=Weight retired in 2011, but stayed on with the Islanders as an assistant coach and senior advisor to GM Garth Snow. With his help, New York ended a six-year playoff drought last season. On Monday, he'll take a quick break from his work to relive some of the most exciting moments of his life, which featured several opportunities to represent his country playing the game he cherishes.}",
