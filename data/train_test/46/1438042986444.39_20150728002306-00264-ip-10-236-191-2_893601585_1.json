Stills will start the tour on May 8, making stops in Portland at Aladdin Theater, in\u2026, 6100=It's official. Crosby, Stills & Nash have announced dates in Japan, the Philippines, and Singapore in March, followed by their only U.S. tour dates for 2015 in April and May., 5379=The U.S. tour will kick off April 29 in Lincoln, Nebraska at the Lied Center and is scheduled to wrap May 20 at the Oakdale Theatre in Wallingford, Connecticut. This run will also feature two stops at the State Theatre in New Brunswick, New Jersey. There will also be two nights scheduled at the Kings Theatre in Brooklyn, New York., 4447=Talk about a folk rock supergroup! That's what you get when you combine the likes of David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash, whose first album was released in 1969. Since then, these guys have been known for their tight vocal harmonies and continued influence on popular music, utilizing blues and even jazz music to widen their already broad appeal., 3399=Some of this group's most well-known singles are their early hits \u2013 \"Woodstock,\" \"Teach Your Children,\" \"Our House\" and \"Ohio,\" just to name a few. In the early 1970's they also became known for their contentious relationships, with oft-added member of the group Neil Young traveling separately from the trio. But as a quartet, they were also unmatched. Their first album as CSN&Y sold more than 7 million copies, and in 1977 when Crosby, Still and Nash regrouped without Young, it was for the quadruple-platinum \"CSN,\" proving that these guys were a hit, no matter what., 2755=Though members of the band went their separate ways \u2013 especially in the 90's \u2013 they would re-group at the turn of the century to release \"Looking Forward.\" It was followed by the band's first tour since 1974, and they reunited with Young again in 2006 for the \"Freedom of Speech\" tour to promote his new album. In early March 2013, Crosby revealed that he and Nash have four brand new, never heard before songs to perform on an upcoming tour. It begins May 1 at the Lincoln Center/Frederick P. Rose Hall in New York City on May 3.}",
