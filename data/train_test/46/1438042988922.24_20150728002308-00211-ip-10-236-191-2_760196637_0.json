And while the big joke of 1996 was the Web sells everything at a loss but makes it up on volume, that's now the hard truth of the newspaper business., 17124=In contrast, online goes from strength to strength. The Internet Advertising Bureau estimates the industry's total ad revenue for the first half of 2013 alone was over $20 billion, and that search engine ads represented $8.7 billion of that., 18182=But the numbers don't add up the way they do in technology. Last year's total box office receipts came to $10.82 billion, according to Box Office Mojo. The final figures for 2013 will show little growth., 16163=Yahoo! is rich today only because Mayer opened Alibaba's cave. Alibaba, a Chinese site that started as a small business-to-business company but grew into China's version of Amazon.com (AMZN), eBay (EBAY) and a commercial bank under Chairman Jack Ma, took $1 billion from Yahoo! in 2005.}",
