Since that time it has grown in importance. This auction provides the ranchers with the opportunity to restock and improve their herds through the prime rams and ewes which are available at the sale. It is also a means of supporting the Washington Wool Growers Association., 11081=The records of the Washington Wool Growers Association have been arranged in four series: Correspondence, 1953-1969; Financial, 1955-1970; General File, 1950-1969; and Ram Sale, 1951-1969. Despite the series division, the material within each of the groups is interrelated. An example of this interrelationship is evident in the Financial material and that of the Ram Sales. All of the financial records pertaining to the Ram Sales are in the Financial series., 10604=The Correspondence series contains material from the period 1953 through 1969; the majority of the material pertains to the period of the mid- to late1960s. The folders in this series are arranged alphabetically by subject; within each folder the material is arranged chronologically. Contained within correspondence are materials from various local, regional and national organizations concerning sheep production, wool growing and land utilization. Principal correspondents are the National Wool Growers Association and the Western Range Association., 8312=The records of the Washington Wool Growers Association were donated to the Washington State University Libraries in October 1979 (MS 79-47) by Secretary George Rugg.}",
