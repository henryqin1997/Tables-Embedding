    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes The present invention has been described in accordance with the preferred embodiments. However, it will be understood that minor variations to the embodiments shown herein may be made without departing from the present invention which is specifically set forth in the appended claims. Of course, there may be other advantages of the present system not discussed herein which will be apparent to those of skill in the art. The present invention provides additional advantages, whether used for pre-donation or post-donation sampling. One advantage is the reduced risk of tubing or donor vein collapse as described above. Container 42 acts as a buffer between the sampling tube and tube or vein. Thus, any suction forces generated by introduction of the vacuum sealed tube will be absorbed by the container 42 and not tube or donor vein. Another advantage of pre-donation sampling is that it may provide a more accurate profile of the donor's blood, particularly regarding the hemoglobin level of the donor. For example, during donation, the loss of blood volume in the donor is compensated by plasma. This compensation by plasma typically lowers the hematocrit of the donor's blood. If the sample is taken after donation, the donor hematocrit may be lower (by possibly as much as 0.5 g/dL) than it otherwise would be if the sample is collected prior to donation. Another advantage of pre-donation sampling is that it",
