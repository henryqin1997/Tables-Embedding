            "What I love most about this campus is how it is structured or located. This campus is small while providing everything it needs. This makes going from class to class much much easier. The campus is also full of trees; the campus where I have ever seen the most trees. The trees make fall so beautiful and spring just unbelievable. It also brings in the nice breeze and cool shades where everyone just loves to relax and even nap under. Another favorite of mine about the campus is, it is right next to the American River. You can see the beautiful river and the salmons from the bridge. You can also take a nice walk with nature along the river. This campus just draws you into the beauty of nature.",
            "Tuition has been increasing over the years, and it just never seems to end. Still affordable, but can be a major problem. Since your paying for it anyways, take advantage of everything they can offer you. You will love it!",
            "CSU-Sacramento is full of fun. You can have more fun here than work you have to do, yet still manage to succeed. The newest and probably the most attractive thing here at CSU-Sacramento is the new gym called The Well. You can get your daily exercise here from jogging to weight lifting, you can play the sports you like from basketball to frisbee, and you can even rock climb or take classes such as yoga. On campus, the school usually have events or performances in which they call nooners. These events take place around noon and they are usually performances of all sorts. Sometimes there will be bands playing music, students performing poems, or even comedies. A good time to relax and enjoy time with friends eating lunch. CSU-Sacramento also have a games room located in the Union. This place is entirely for games. There are video games from Playstation, Xbox, and even classic games. There are also billiards and table tennis. While this place attracts a lot of fun, the Union also have rooms solely for listening to music and watching television. So much fun to go around, it gets hard to choose what to do.",
            "CSU-Sacramento is located in a rather good location with plenty of food and dining places to go to. On campus though, there are quite a few of variety of food to eat. These food range from burgers and pizzas to sushi and curry. Very diverse food here probably due to the diversity of students attending CSU-Sacramento.",
            "I am actually not living in the dorms at CSU-Sacramento. I am born here and live here myself in Sacramento. So instead I commute back and forth from my home with my parents and school. Although I personally do not live in the dorms, I have been there quite a few times and I would rather live there than in my own home sometimes. Roommates and other students seem friendly. Everyone just seems to know everyone. They actually design their doors, have their names on them, and even welcome in students. The dorms itself are not huge, but big enough with space for two students' living. The dorms also provide quiet study rooms even though the dorms are already quiet and it have its own entertainment room for students in the dorm. A great, peaceful, and fun place to live if I was to live in the dorms.",
            "The academics, the learning, and the work here is tough, but which college is not. Going into a college, this kind of work is to be expected. Here at CSU-Sacramento, it is just as rough and harsh with a few exceptions. CSU-Sacramento goes by a semester system: two semesters a year and sixteen weeks a semester. With this system, you might not graduate as soon as you want to compared to other four year universities, but you will be able to learn better and at your pace. You will not have to stress with the work load as much, while, at the same time, you are able to enjoy learning. Being able to enjoy learning compared to stressing over learning, will make a whole lot of difference in your college life. Not only that, CSU-Sacramento has plentiful lecturers and professors who are approachable, understandable, helpful, and even lenient. With professors like that, you will have a much easier time with your academics. Our professors and staffs care, and they want us to succeed as a college student, not for us to fail.",
            "Being a new student to a college can be intimidating and tough, but here, at CSU-Sacramento, they should never worry and never stress because they make you feel as if everything is in the palm of your hands. Help is ALWAYS available. Everyone is friendly; no one can be a stranger. The best thing about first coming to the school is to see how easily you can fit in and how amazing that the school will care for you. This does not mean that they will do everything for you, but they offer everything that you will need. Also remember to talk to your professors, they are not as intimidating as they appear. They are quite fun, kind, and even very caring. Professors love it when students visit them or else they will be bored. Besides the academic, CSU-Sacramento have plenty of fun and entertainment almost every single day. You have endless choices of things to do. You can go to their new gym, called The Well, and rock climb, you can play all sorts of games in the Games Room, you can enjoy live music/bands with your lunch, and etc. The fun is endless here.",
            "CSU - Sacramento has excellent staffs, professors, and lecturers that are the best when it comes to helping students succeed and making everyone feel welcome and comfortable as a student. The school is a bit tiny compared to the many students attending there, yet everyone feels close, safe, and are able to bond greatly. The school offers everything that you will ever need and there are plenty of shades of trees for everyone."

The campus is filled with various beautiful trees and scenery., 992495=The dorm life is amazing!I had several friends that attended Sac State in 2008 so when I'd visit them I got to experience some of that life and it was extremely fun., 77556=The grass wasn't grass but mud, even in May. It smelled awful. It felt like a high school campus with lockers everywhere., 1001993=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 668851=A nice campus that has a ton of resources for students to use. There's friendly staff and students. The food there are so good and during the start of Fall 2013 Sac State will be opening a Starbucks!, 858485=I really like the food that we are provided with. Many times the school will give us the same type of food but I go trying out all the food there is and it is actually really good. There are hamburgers, pizza, beans, rice, lasagna, pasta, steak, and many more. What I do not like about our Dining is that they close pretty early. During the weekdays it closes at 8:00PM and in the weekends around 6:00PM., 633998=I know that there is a lot of things offered, from the aquatic center to things at the WELL (the gym on campus) if you are into that type of stuff. Some clubs like the ballroom dancing club offer things as well. Then there is Unique and they bring different things on campus so the students can enjoy, like this March they had a Taiko group performing., 663458=If you stay in the dorms, you have a meal plan. The courtyard market has some good sandwiches and pizza. The dining commons has good food but you get tired of it easily. It's buffet style so it's easy to gain Freshman 15. Starbucks will be opening Fall 2013., 61903=I haven't experienced dorm life yet, but will be experiencing in 2013}",
