    "textAfterTable": "Academic Rigor most courses provided many opportunities to maintain high grades. on occasion i took courses that were challenging and stimulating, however the average class is easy to pass when work is put into it. Tips for prospective students enter college prepared, knowing in advance what you want to study. line your classes up with any universities programs you plan to transfer into. In three sentences tacoma community college is diverse with many cultures and ages. the courses offered are good, however, i have experience both good and bad teachers. unfortunately though, it is difficult to accomplish anything through the office administration and desk workers aren't very willing to put in effort above what is expected.
