Whatever your thoughts, you can have your say in this week's Vital Sheffield Wednesday poll! Wednesday have had a goalkeeping problem since the injury to David Lucas last season - young Liverpool stopper Scott Carson helped the Owls to survival towards the end of the last campaign, but Rafa Benitez decided against allowing him to return this season. The decision meant former boss Paul Sturrock had to draft Middlesbrough's Australian stopper Brad Jones in for the first three months of the season - a move which proved to be unpopular with the Owls faithful. Since then Brian Laws acted quickly to bring in former Nottingham Forest team-mate Mark Crossley on loan from Fulham until January - but with the loan deal coming to an end shortly, should the Owls extend the deal until the end of the season at least? Crossley's arrival has co-incided with an upturn in fortunes for the Owls, and his performances have been seen as a vast improvement on Jones' short time between the sticks - with just one defeat coming at Coventry City since his move north. So should Brian Laws extend his deal at S6 - or should Wednesday look elsewhere for a number one?
