    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students This is a great College expectually for people fresh out of high school. If you are going to apply, apply early so you have time to relax before you have to start. Also get books ASAP because if you wait some time you will not have the chance of having a used book. Bang for the buck I have gotten in on scholarships and Pell grants and have no extra fees to pay. Though books may be expensive they are necessary for some classes. Am enjoying being here This is a very small school, it is more structured like a high school than a college (extra activities wise), though they have college level work, that will help you succeed in life. Am learning a lot Some of the classes may be hard but they have tutors to help you when you need it. Also the teachers will work with you if you try to talk to them.
