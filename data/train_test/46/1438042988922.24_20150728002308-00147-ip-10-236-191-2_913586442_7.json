            "This college is great for students who want to become a doctor and willing to work hard to get to that place.",
            "Be prepared to work hard and study. You have to also talk to upper classman to see who to take because there are some problems at Xavier like lack of understanding due to accents.",
            "Although it may not seem that it is worth it, but in reality it is. Xavier has taught me a lot of different things. The education you are paying for is worth it in the long run because Xavier has this way of making you do your best. Every grade you get you have to earn it.",
            "Xavier is a hate or love school honestly. The school has hardly any extracurriclur activities, but they make up with events that scheduled throughout the semester. The environment is great! Everyone around you is positive and willing to help with whatever problem you may have. Furthermore, waking up to the beautiful campus is also a plus.",
            "At Xavier you will learn a lot about yourself and about your major. You have to constantly study as usual. Xavier have different programs around campus that would help you such as writing centers, math centers, chemistry centers, and etc."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{223776=The dorms at Xavier University are slightly stricter than dorms at other universities: most times, the floors (wings) are separated by gender; if anyone is caught indulging in underage drinking, they are forced to pay a fine, do community service, and their parents are notified; and dorm parties are usually busted quickly by Resident Assistants (RAs). However, these precautions ensure the safety of all students. Although students of the opposite gender cannot spend the night, they do not have to leave until 2:00 a.m., which is pretty reasonable. We also have a zero-tolerance policy during finals week where no student is allowed to have their door open or be in the hallways; this ensures that all students can focus hard. We do our best to make sure that the majority of students are pleased., 153836=Xavier football: undefeated since 1973 Xavier basketball: unstoppable since, ever. ADP (we will be legends! One day... I promise), 138942=Xavier is a great school that has wonderful opportunities for everyone. Classes are small with one-on-one attention and a 12:1 student to faculty ratio. With the most up to date technology, students are sure that they are get a solid education that is worth their money., 293956=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
