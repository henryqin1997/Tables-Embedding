Within those folders are a geography file and zipped files containing the estimate and margin of error files, one per \"sequence\" (sequences are explained in Chapter 2.3). Downloading from these folders is ideal if users only want a few tables for a state level geography or cross-state geographies. For a graphical representation of this folder and its contents, visit Appendix B.3. 2007-2011_ACSSF_By_State_By_Sequence_Table_Subset The \"By State All Tables\" directory contains zipped files for each state or state level equivalent-each of the 50 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, as well as cross-state geographies such as metropolitan areas. Each zipped file contains a geography file and multiple estimate and margin of error files. Downloading from these state level folders is ideal if users want all the tables for a state level geography or cross-state geographies. For a graphical representation of this folder and its contents, visit Appendix B.2. 2007-2011_ACSSF_By_State_All_Tables The \"All in 1 Giant File\" directory contains a zipped file, which includes geography, estimate, and margin of error files. This zipped file is ideal to download",

Sequence Numbers back to top Detailed Tables for similar subject areas are grouped together in \"sequences.\" A sequence number is a number assigned to a group of ACS tables. Table sequencing now follows these new rules: 1) Tables in the summary file are sorted numerically by the \"root\" of their Table ID, where the \"root\" is defined as the numeric section after the first letter (a B or C) and before any additional letters. As an example, the root of B06004APR is \"06004,\" where \"06\" represents the \"subject\" place of birth. Table IDs with the same root are sorted in the following order: Non-iterated, non-collapsed, non-PR version (e.g., Table B06003) Iterated, non-collapsed, non-PR versions (e.g., Tables B06004A, B06004B...B06004I) Non-iterated, collapsed, non-PR version (e.g., Table C06001) Iterated, collapsed, non-PR version (e.g., Tables C08505A, C08505B... C08505I) Non-iterated,",
