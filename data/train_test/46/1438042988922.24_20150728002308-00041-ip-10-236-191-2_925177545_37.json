            "Pasadena City College is a great place for students that enjoy being independent and that like having the opportunity to experience courses ranging from Literature, Photography, to Automotive Techniques.",
            "The campus hosts the Mirror Pools, which are two raised platforms that are located at the front of the campus. They are a great gathering area, surrounded by young trees that offer enough shade if you decide to take a rest/nap between classes.",
            "Pasadena City College has an amazing library staff, they are extraordinarily helpful and always full of patience which is really quite necessary from what I have witnessed.",
            "PCC has many clubs to join. There are also travel abroad programs. Since the campus is located on Colorado, travel a few blocks west and you'll be in the city's shopping center.",
            "There is the Piazza and another restaurant on campus which I have not visited, but those who have tell me its great, but pricey. Across the street from the campus is Junk food haven: Burgers, Chinese Takeout, Thai, Boba, Sandwiches, Pizza, Starbucks, and much more.",
            "This is a community college so there are no dorms available.",
            "Math classes are practically impossible to pass, many opt to go to different CC campuses. Professors are highly qualified and demand a lot, all have different teaching techniques so don't ever expect a similar classroom routine.",
            "Be ready with class codes before logging-in to your student account, classes go quick. In between classes it's always relaxing at the Shatford Library. On the first day, arrive at least an hr earlier, 2 hrs if you're driving, parking is terrible.",
            "Lots of tutoring is offered so it is easy to keep up with classroom material. Classes get full fast, especially English and Math. Pasadena City College is just a great environment, with friendly staff and student body."

For women walking alone to cars in garage at night, ask for an escort or walk with another woman, especially to the Del Mar parking structure. Theft is problem here, even from padlocked lockers in the locker rooms, so watch your things carefully., 147330=Most of the time, for every one bad professor you end up taking a class with, you will have one to two professors who will make learning fun (ratio is 1:1.5). It's pretty much a life & death situation/battle for parking in the school parking lots during the first few weeks of the semester. The campus is alright; the annoying part is that there is always construction happening somewhere, and is sometimes a distraction during lectures., 315084=While I lived at home attending Pasadena City College, I have made friends who lived around the campus. There is no on-campus dorm option, but the apartments around the campus are around 400-1000 dollars per month. These apartments usually require you to be very quiet, but some have utility and game rooms., 475267=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Speak to your teachers, they really have some great stories and advice. Bang for the buck The classes are affordable, if you go to Art Center or any other art school, you'll be paying triple times more than here for about the same courses. But of course if you want to go to a prestigious art school be my guest, but you can save some money here before transferring to an art school. Am enjoying being here I enjoy being here for the available classes I've been able to get the necessary classes to transfer, most students beginning their first year here haven't been lucky enough to get general education classes. Am learning a lot I'm a design student at PCC, so this is helpful for those majoring in art. The professors at this school are amazing, they attended prestigious schools and have a lot to teach their students so take advantage of it. I've learned and understood a lot about art from basic drawing to 3 dimensional design and I will continue to take many more art courses here. Login to rate or flag the reviews",
