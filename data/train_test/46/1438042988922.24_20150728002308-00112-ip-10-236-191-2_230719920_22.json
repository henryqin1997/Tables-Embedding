The Turkish official took charge of the Euro 2012 semi-final between Spain and Portugal and notably, was the referee of Sir Alex Ferguson's last ever Champions League game back in March 2013. 0' HEAD-TO-HEAD These two have only met once before and that was 50 years ago back in 1964 when they played out a 2-2 draw in a friendly game. That was when Russia were part of the Soviet Union. Though Russia haven't, Capello has come up against Algeria before. In 2010 he was in charge of England as they drew 0-0 with the Desert Foxes in South Africa. 0' HISTORY ON THEIR SIDE In their nine previous FIFA World Cup tournaments Russia have always won at least once in the group stages, so with that in mind, it could possibly be an omen which sends Capello's side through to the last 16, where they would more than likely be coming up against one of the favourites Germany. Aleksandr Kerzhakov could also make his own history",
