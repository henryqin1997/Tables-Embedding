Shipping Time - allows you to compare the delivery time so you can choose the shipping option to suit your needs and budget. Processing Time - refers to how long it takes the store to ship your book. Some stores have books in stock and can ship within 24 hours. Some stores will take a considerably longer time to fulfill an order. When you add the processing time and the shipping time, you will know how soon you can expect your book if you order it today.
