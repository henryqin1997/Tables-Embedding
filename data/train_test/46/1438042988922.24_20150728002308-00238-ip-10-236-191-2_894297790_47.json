            "There is a video game room where most of the guys and girls who enjoy video games hang out in.",
            "For a community college it offers a lot, more then many other community colleges. Its a great place to start your college experience. Taking the general education classes here is definitely the way to go because it is cheaper and will save you money in the long run.",
            "There are different sporting event, Campus Events, community event that can be participated in",
            "There is no formal dinning hall here at MCC. They have a 2 coffee shops located in the main buildings and they have a Market place. The Market place is where you can find a Subway, Denny's express, Dunkin Donuts, and regular Cafeteria food. Each location you pay for the prices they have set up. There is a meal plan, where you put money on an account but it isn't a meal plan like you would at a 4 year school",
            "Its a great experience to live right here on campus. You get to meet new people and participate in different programs that the residence halls provide. You will have 4 to 5 roommates depending on the suite style you get. You are missing out if you don't live on campus",
            "This really depends on the professor and their personal class standards. Many professors in the 100 levels don't expect as much of you as the 200+ level professors. But again it depends on the professor there can be 100 level professors that treat it like a 200+ level class.",
            "You should take advantage of all the different learning centers on campus.Get involved in the different clubs, be proactive and it makes coming to school more fun. Most importantly talk with the professors they want to help you succeed and they can only do that if you talk to them or go to their office hours.",
            "MCC is a wonderful school there is always so much going on. You always feel comfortable and welcomed no matter where you are on campus."

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck At Monroe there is a family atmosphere where everyone on the faculty looks out for the students and help them to adjust to the learning environs. This is particularly so for international students who left their country to study here. It is a welcoming feeling to walk int any of the offices on campus. What to do for fun It is situated in a community so there is shopping, theatre, a lot of dining options. There is also access to the Bronx zoo by taking the train or bus. Food and Dining There is a cafeteria which caters to individuals from boarders to non-boarders and even th faculty at large. Dorm Life They have a lot of dorming facilities which in my opinion are very well kept and safe. It is also accessible by those with challenges and all different types of students attend. Academic Rigor This college is aimed at preparing people for the world f work. They make sure that they give enough work so that you will be ready for the world. They have professors who take time in teaching",
