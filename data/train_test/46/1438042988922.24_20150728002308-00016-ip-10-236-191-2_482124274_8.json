    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes While there have been described what are believed to be the preferred embodiments of the present invention, those skilled in the art will recognize that further changes and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit of the invention, and it is intended to claim all such changes and modification as fall within the true scope of the invention. For example, although the present invention has been described in the context of a self-service shopping system, the invention may be applied to any terminal system whether employed in retail or other data collection system. The implementation of the boundary sensing can be accomplished using RFID tag technology. Local access points can be set up throughout the designated area, typically the store, to monitor the location of the terminal. As long as the terminal is within the bounds of the designated area, the system behaves normally. As soon as, or with slight delay, the terminal is taken outside the access point area, the terminal senses loss of contact with the access points and enables the terminal alarm mechanism. This method of operation is useful because it reduces the store's risk of terminal loss. The communication between the terminal and the local access points can be achieved via a wireless RF communication LAN, such as the Spectrum24 network. It should be obvious to one skilled in the surveillance art that other embodiments of the security",
