    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The invention disclosed employs frequency modulation of an applied voltage to send signals in one direction; and it employs phase-shift modulation to send signals in the opposite direction by means which are not hampered by the changes in frequency of the applied voltage. This combination is economical in the number of conductors required in cable 16, which has the practical advantage that these may be used also as power conductors of considerable thickness, more rugged and easily protected than would be a greater number of conductors. The novel device of transmitting command signals down-hole by a succession of pulses of equal weight facilitates the operation of the invention by eliminating the requirement for careful synchronization or timing inherent in conventional binary encoded transmission. Other methods of measuring phase are, of course, common in the art; for example, the zero crossings of the two signals may be detected, and the time interval between these crossings may be measured as a measure of the phase. However, it is not here required to measure phases accurately, but simply to detect comparatively gross changes in the phase; the simplest operative method for doing so will probably be preferred. The detection of the indicated phase change is performed by surface receiver 20 which is completely conventional in the art and so not given in detail. Surface receiver 20 is connected to VCO 10 to receive a voltage fixed in phase with",
