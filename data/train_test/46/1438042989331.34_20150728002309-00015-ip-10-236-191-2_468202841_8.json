The resistance coil heater has a resistance of about 25 ohms and when activated does not glow red. This implies a somewhat low operating temperature, reducing the danger of exceeding the fixed point activation mechanism and allowing the coil to cool faster. As shown in FIG. 4, the resistance coil heater can be assembled on the mounting board 20 with the outer periphery of the mounting board 20 sized for receipt within the outer housing 12. The audible alarm 22, the timing circuit components 24 and the switches 14 are all secured on a circuit board 25 which, again, has an outer periphery sized for receipt within the outer housing 12. This circuit board 25 bottoms out on shoulders 29 of the housing and position the switches beneath mounting board 20 which is in contact with outwardly depending flanges 23 of the locating collar 8. These flanges, again, serve to locate the collar 8 within the housing 12. Thus, the various components may merely be inserted within the housing 12, simplifying assembly, if desired. The mounting board 20 which secures the resistance coil heater 6, preferably has a number of solder",
