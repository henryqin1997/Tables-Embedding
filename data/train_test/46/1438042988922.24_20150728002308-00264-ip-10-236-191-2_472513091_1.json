First, the bad, and there's a fair bit: Rama II is not as good as Rendezvous with Rama, the society is bland, the technological speculation isn't as exciting and the mysteries don't appear until the decidedly more interesting last third (or half, or thereabouts) of the book. When the mysteries do come however, they are just as amazing as in the first book, maybe even more so as the first part of the book, while boring, did a great deal to introduce the deep, multi-dimensional characters. If you've read \"Rendezvous with Rama\" and liked it, stick with this book and read it through to the end, you won't regret it. If you didn't like it (heathen!) or just felt apathetic about it, Rama II will probably bore you. ...more"
