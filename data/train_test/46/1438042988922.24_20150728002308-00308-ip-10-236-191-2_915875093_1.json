            "The school is great for people looking to live at home and commute. Or people that would like to work as well as be a full-time student (like me).",
            "The University of New Orleans is a great choice in school. My tips would be to work in HS to get the best scholarship you can (meal & book coverage is definitely worth it.. that is if you have TOPS to cover tuition). The counselors are not the greatest at scheduling your classes, so you are better off asking someone that attends/attended the school to schedule you. You are better off going to Spring Testing.. try to test out of whatever you can. It will get you out of College quicker.",
            "I give UNO a 5-star in education for the buck. The education is great, and definitely worth the tuition price. My problem are the extra fees UNO tacks on. Such as the Fitness Center fee.. whether you use it or not, you pay for it. Or the Academic Excellence fee which is a fee for.... being excellent? Or the Fuel Recovery charge for the on-campus electric generator. And on-campus meals are EXPENSIVE. The on-campus bookstore way overcharges for their books, but that is what half.com is for. So all-in-all, the education is worth the tuition, the fees are ridiculous, the meal & book prices are ridiculous as well.",
            "UNO is more of a commuting school than a fun school. There are not many things to do around the school, and many students just go for schooling then leave back home or to go to work. However it is still an enjoyable experience, and I have a good time sitting with friends during my breaks, or while walking to classes.",
            "While many people believe that graduating from a bigger name school (ie Tulane, Loyola, LSU) means a better education, UNO is right on par. Many of my professors and instructors teach at Tulane and Loyola as well. I have been learning a good bit in my current classes, and I am very satisfied with the education I am receiving. And when you graduate and are applying, unless you are trying to get into a competitive work atmosphere (ie Law or Medical) a UNO degree holds just as much weight as anywhere else."

There are so many opportunities to get involved on campus and to make the best of your time here. I am graduating in December so it will be bittersweet!, 14775=The University of New Orleans is a great school. Since I began school in August, it has been nonstop learning and experiencing new subjects. Being a freshman in a new environment has been a quite a change, but UNO is a great school to be in a diverse environment and allows you to understand and embrace new ideas. I have learned a lot while attending here and I cannot wait to start my next semester here.}",

Big and small classes. First time independence. Tips for prospective students Check out all of your options when in comes to housing. Sometimes the Apartments are cheaper then the dorms.Take as many classes as you can, it is a great help in being able to afford school in the long run. Get the used text books and always check blackboard and your e-mail. Bang for the buck Just before I started school I was worried about how I would pay for college, during orientation we were shown how UNO students can check our financial aid. I was still worried about how I would pay for books and housing, but then I was told that I can rent books and",
