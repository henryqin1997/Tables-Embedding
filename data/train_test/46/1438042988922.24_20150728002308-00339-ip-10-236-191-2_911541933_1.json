    "textBeforeTable": "vs. DDO Harvard plays its fifth game in three days Monday when it visits Hartwick for a 4 p.m. game. In its first game of the day, Harvard beat the DDO water polo club, 18-6, behind five goals and five steals from junior co-captain Devan Kennifer and 10 saves from junior goalie Laurel McCarthy. The Crimson pulled to within one goal with about 90 seconds to play in the fourth quarter but couldn't close the gap as the Red Foxes pulled away for the 13-10 win. Freshman Shayna Price had seven scores, two helpers and three takeaways in the game. \"You're always learning things and losses are where you learn the most,\" Harvard head coach Ted Minnis said. \"We convert three more (6-on-5 opportunities) and we're going to overtime with them. I think that's something we can build off of.\" The Crimson actually led the Red Foxes, 4-1, at one point during the first frame and held a 6-3 advantage after one. Harvard's shooting accuracy suffered from then on, and the team went 1-for-7 in 6-on-5 opportunities, allowing Marist to take control. POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y.\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Facing its toughest competition yet, the Harvard women's water polo team's fourth-period comeback effort fell just short against No. 15 Marist Sunday, ending the team's six-game win streak in a 13-10 setback. The Crimson defeated the DDO water polo club, 18-6, earlier in the day. Sophomore Elise Molnar totalled two goals, five assists and four steals in two games Sunday (photo courtesy Gil",
