In this example, the P-Values were very low (the lower P-value representing the higher confidence value) for these four remaining ORFs. FIG. 6P shows a representative example Gene Locus Information screen 642 for one of these remaining ORFs, that being ORF ID SP001088 as shown in row 643 of the figure. Since the ORF is located in the middle of its contig, it likely represents the entire coding sequence for the hyaluronidase gene., 91946=Client/server environments, database servers, relational databases and networks are well documented in the technical, trade, and patent literature. For a discussion of database servers, relational databases and client/server environments generally, and SQL servers particularly, see, e.g., Nath, A., The Guide To SQL Server, 2nd ed., Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., 1995 (which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes)., 150540=Then, returning to the Comparative Genomics Results screen shown in FIG. 6B, as described above, the user clicked on the third Hit ID g881507 613, which returned the Electronic Southern Results screen 630 shown in FIG. 6L. In this instance, the copies column 631 in entry 632 showed that there are six contigs in Cluster g881507. By clicking on the number of copies 631, the Organism Gene Copies screen 633 illustrated in FIG. 6M is returned. This screen identifies the six ORFs which are grouped within the selected cluster., 50396=This application claims priority under 35 USC \ufffd 119(e) from U.S. Provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/032,565 (attorney docket no. ICYTP003+), filed Dec. 12, 1996 and entitled DATABASE OF MICROBIAL NUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCES. In addition, this application incorporates by reference in its entirety and for all purposes application Ser. No. 08/856,647 (attorney docket no. ICYTP003) entitled DATABASE AND SYSTEM FOR DETERMINING, STORING AND DISPLAYING GENE LOCUS INFORMATION, filed concurrently herewith., 149474=From the Sequence Information Results screen 626, the user has several options which may be exercised by clicking on the various buttons available. For instance, the user could click on the assembly button 627 in order to show additional information relating to ORF SP001074. In this particular example, this option was not exercised., 151085=Further information regarding these ORFs and their respective contigs may be obtained by clicking on the various HTML links available in the Organism Gene Copies screen 633. For instance, it may be interesting to further investigate those ORFs with the lowest P-Values, since those are less likely to be fully described in available databases. In the present example, the P-values for ORF Ids SP001043 634 and SP000709 635 were the highest for any of the six ORFs. The user clicked on ORF ID SP001043 634, returning the Gene Locus Information screen 636 illustrated in FIG. 6N. Line 637 of the Gene Locus Information screen 636 showed that ORF ID SP001043 is at the beginning of contig Spc00591. This may indicate that the ORF represents an incomplete copy of the hyaluronidase gene. At this point, the user clicked on the P-Value HTML link 638 in line 637 to return the BLAST Search Results screen showing the alignment of contig SPc00591 with the associated GenBank sequence (not shown). In this example, the results of the BLAST showed that the beginning of the contig overlaps with the end of the protein., 149027=Next, by clicking on the Sequence Info button in a BLAST Search Form screen (not shown), the Sequence Information Results screen 626 was returned, as illustrated in FIG. 6K. This screen lists the specific sequences in the genomic library for this organism which are within the portion of contig SPc00596 that relates to ORF SP001074. In this particular example, there were 14 individual sequences which related to ORF SP001074., 152214=In order to investigate other ORFs in this cluster, the user clicked on HTML links to return to the Organism Gene copy screen 633, shown in FIG. 6M, and then clicked on ORF ID SP000709 635, to return the Gene Locus Information screen 639 associated with that ORF, shown in FIG. 6O. As shown in FIG. 6O, ORF ID SP000709's contig contained only that ORF and a LUR. Therefore, as with ORF SP001043, this ORF is suspect and likely does not contain the entire sequence for the hyaluronidase gene. By clicking on the P-Value 641 in line 640, the BLAST Search Results screen for ORF SP000709 was returned. The BLAST results (not shown) showed that the end of the contig SPc00495 overlaps the beginning of the protein. From this data, it may be concluded that ORF Ids SP001043 and SP000709 are two halves of the same gene and that deeper sequencing may bring these two halves together into a single ORF.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes Although a few specific embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail, it should be understood that the present invention may be embodied in many other specific forms without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as recited in the claims. For example, while the genomic database of this invention has been described as storing sequences of genomic nucleic acid along a contiguous sequence as the fundamental data unit, there is in principle no reason why other sequence units can not also be employed. For example, the databases of this invention could be employed to store and analyze expressed nucleic acid or amino acid sequences. 8. Conclusion As described, Electronic Southerns are useful for identifying genomic libraries in which a given gene or ORF of interest exists. Some preferred and specific embodiments of the Electronic Southerns feature have been described. However, those of skill in the art will recognize that Electronic Southerns may be implemented in a database system according to the present invention in other ways which do not depart from the sprit and scope of the invention. ______________________________________Southerns______________________________________**BY GISELECT NVL(HitDescription,``), NVL(HitDataSource,``)FROM PA-- OrfHitDescription-- VWHERE HitType = `g`AND HitID = 345145GROUP BY HitDescription, HitDataSourceSELECT LibraryID, LibDescription, count(*)FROM PA-- OrfLibraries-- VWHERE GeneCluID in (SELECTGeneCluID FROM PA-- OrfHitGeneClusters-- V WHERE HitType =`g`GROUP BY LibraryID, LibDescriptionORDER BY LibraryIDSELECT DISTINCT OrfIDFROM PA-- OrfLibraries-- VWHERE GeneCluID IN (SELECT GeneCluID FROM PA--",
