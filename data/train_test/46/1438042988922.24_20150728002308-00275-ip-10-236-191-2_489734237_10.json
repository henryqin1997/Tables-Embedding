    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6198=Referring again to FIG. 11A, the sample may be illuminated and analyzed substantially simultaneously or sequentially with laser from source 1110 and emitted photons from LED source 1105. Next, the scattered and emitted photons beam 1118 from the sample are collected by a lens 1116 and reflected by surface 1114 into the wavelength imaging filter. The reflecting surface 1114 can be configured to allow the laser light to pass thru while reflecting the scattered and emitted photon beam 1118. The illumination filter 1107 removes the wavelengths of the Raleigh scattered illuminating light that can swamp the detectors. The polarization beam splitter 1120 separates one polarization of the emitted and scattered light and allows it to be analyzed by the two different filters/detector subsystems shown to the left and below beam splitter 1120. Either CMOS (shown) or CCD detectors (1132, 1126) may register the wavelength selected/filters signals that are read and analyzed by the control module 1134 and an analyzer. The analyzer can be software stored on the CPU using data stored in the memory of the device. Alternatively, a processor can be programmed with a software to detect the chemical signature of the sample by comparing its spectrum with known spectrums stored in the CPU database.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{151922=In another embodiment, the device 1100 is used in conjunction with both the multipoint method and FAST. The high numbers of optical fibers required for FAST imaging applications place extraordinary demands on the imaging spectrograph which the multipoint method addresses. Instead of having millions of pixels, multipoint analysis can utilize larger diameter fibers in bundles containing tens to hundreds of fibers. In the multipoint method of spectral sensing and analysis, complete spectral imaging (which would require at least thousands of adjacent pixels to create a physical image) is not required. Instead, spectral sensing performed at tens to hundreds of points simultaneously can rapidly (on the order of seconds, for example) provide high quality spatially resolved spectra from a wide variety of points on the sample needed for analysis and identification. Thus, even if the precise geometric arrangement of the points analyzed in the field of view is not known, the points nonetheless have a defined geometrical arrangement which can span a sample or a field of view. The analyzed points are informative regarding the presence and, if present, the amount of hazardous agent of interest in a sample., 176324=The photon source 1920 may preferably be a laser emitting photons having a wavelength in the range of 522 to 542 nanometers, and more preferably having a wavelength of 532 nanometers (i.e., a green laser). The photon source may emit photons having a wavelength in the range of wavelengths associated with white light, near infrared light, infrared light, ultraviolet light or other wavelength ranges that can be used for spectroscopy. The optical window 1812 may be comprised of a material that is transparent to the first and second photons passing therethrough, such as, but not limited to, fused silica, plastic, quartz, glass, or a combination of two or more of those components. The fiber optic array 1960 may preferably be a Fiber Array Spectral Translator (\u201cFAST\u201d) as described herein. The first end of the fiber optic array 1960 may be a two-dimensional array and the second end of the fiber optic array may be a one-dimensional array., 53293=The present application hereby incorporates by reference in its entirety and claims priority benefit from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/711,455, filed Aug. 25, 2005. Additionally, the present application is a continuation-in-part of and hereby incorporates by reference in its entirety and claims priority benefit from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/366,531, filed Mar. 2, 2006, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/893,332, filed Jul. 19, 2004, which claims filing date priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/488,246 filed Jul. 18, 2003, and which claims filing date priority to U.S. application Ser.

No. 11/366,532 (\u201cMethod and Apparatus for Compact Spectrometer for Detecting Hazardous Agents\u201d), and U.S. application Ser. No. 11/366,660 (\u201cMethod and Apparatus for Compact Spectrometer for Multipoint Sampling of an Object\u201d). The specification of each of the above-identified applications is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 132984=The FAST system allows for massively parallel acquisition of full-spectral images. A FAST fiber bundle may feed optical information from is two-dimensional non-linear imaging end (which can be in any non-linear configuration, e.g., circular, square, rectangular, etc.) to its one-dimensional linear distal end. The distal end feeds the optical information into associated detector rows. The detector may be a CCD detector having a fixed number of rows with each row having a predetermined number of pixels. For example, in a 1024-width square detector, there will be 1024 pixels (related to, for example, 1024 spectral wavelengths) per each of the 1024 rows., 179282=The sample 1801 may be a biothreat agent including, but not limited to: anthrax, botulism, plague, smallpox, tularemia, viral hemorrhagic fevers, salmonella, E-coli, vibrio cholerae, cryptosporidium parvum, ricin toxin, brucellosis, glanders, melioidosis, Chlamydia psittaci, Q fever, staphylococcal enterotoxin B, typhus fever, viral encephalitis, epsilon toxin of clostridium perfringens, bacterial spores, live cells, virus, toxins, protozoan, protozoan cyst, and combinations thereof., 127782=The Device 1100 can be used, for example, to detect and/or classify as to species, strains, and viability the following objects and/or pathogenic microorganisms, such as, for example, biological warfare agents and chemical warfare agents, as well as any growth medium associated therewith: Anthrax (Bacillus anthracis), protozoa, cryptosporidia, Escherichia coli, Escherichia coli 157, Plague (Yersinia pestis), Smallpox (variola major), Tularemia (Francisella tularensis), Brucellosis (Brucella species), Clostridium pertringens, Glanders (Burkholderia mallei), Melioidosis (Berkholderia pseudomallei), Psittacosis (Chlamydia psittaci), Q fever (Coxiella burnetii), Typhus fever (Rickettsia prowazekii), Vibrio (Vibrio cholerae), Giardia, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, filoviruses (such as Ebola and Marburg viruses), naviruses (such as Lassa fever and Machupo viruses), alphaviruses (such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis, eastern equine encephalitis, and western equine encephalitis), Salmonella, and Shigella., 179838=An alternative embodiment of the sample container 1805 may be configured without the filter element 1816 and with a non-hollow plunger 1814. In this embodiment, the plunger 1814 does not form a seal with the vial 1810. Therefore, any liquid and gas that may be in the vial after the sample 1801 is added to the vial and the non-hollow plunger 1814 is inserted and slid into the vial is bled off through the non-sealed gap between the plunger 1814 and the walls of the vial 1810. The optical window 1812 may be configured as described above., 172569=If the sample 1801 includes a suspicious liquid containing, for example, a suspicious powder that has been mixed with a wash solution, or a liquid in which are suspended bio-particulates, or a precipitate of a toxin, or similar-type samples, the above description generally applies with the additional consideration that all, or substantially all, of the liquid portion must be forced out of the vial 1810 via the filter element 1816 and into the hollow center portion of the plunger 1814. If the sample 1801 is a suspicious liquid, then some of the suspicious liquid must remain in the sample vial for the spectral analysis., 163375=Finally, handheld device 1440 represents an exemplary representation of a lower cost, consumer oriented device with simplified operating controls and menu driven input similar to a cellular telephone. This unit can be programmed to detect a certain chemicals depending upon its intended application., 175472=The photon detector 1970 may send a signal representative of the spectral analysis of the sample 1801 to a microprocessor 1974. The microprocessor may compare the spectral analysis of the sample to a spectrum of a biothreat agent stored in a memory device 1972. A display unit 1976 may display the signal from the photon detector 1970, a signal from the microprocessor 1974, and/or a signal from the memory device 1972. A user of the analysis system may utilize an input device 1978, for example a keyboard or a pointing device such as a mouse, for controlling the operation of the analysis system. In one embodiment of the disclosure, the display unit 1976 and the input device 1978 may be an integrated unit, such as a touch-screen display., 116792=The optical systems 1009 and 1011 before and after the Fabry-Perot plates can be used to allow the light scattered or emitted from the sample 1005 to accurately and faithfully reproduce each (x, y) location of the sample 1005 onto the detector plate 1020 at (x\u2032, y\u2032). The specific detector pixels form an image or spatially accurate representation corresponding to positions of points in the image of the sample. Optical configurations are possible where transmitted light is discriminated without using optical systems 1009 and 1011 that contain lenses. For example, a stacked Fabry-Perot array wherein each etalon discriminates for wavelength due to the thickness of the cavity in a normal direction has the characteristic of selectively passing only normally oriented rays, thereby effectively collimating the light from the image and providing a spatially resolved image as applied to the detector., 114767=The filter wavelength \u03bb is selected by changing the cavity or distance between each of the Fabry-Perot filter elements in a predetermined manner. The actuator displacements, the spacing between plates and number of plates determines the range of the wavelengths over which transmission is achieved upon actuator changes (i.e., tuning), as well as the wavelength window over which the light at wavelength \u03bb is transmitted (i.e., the bandpass.) Bandpasses for such a device can be as narrow as 0.25 nm (high resolution) or up to 10 nm (lower resolution). The ranges of wavelength over which the device operates (i.e., filter different wavelengths of light) can be, for example, between 400 nm and 1800 nm. The design tradeoffs that achieve such performance are selected to optimize the number of elements (cost and simplicity) and the overall transmission function (optical efficiency) for any particular measurement requirement such as Raman, Fluorescence, VIS or NIR chemical imaging., 135007=In yet another embodiment, a multipoint method and apparatus may be used in conjunction with the device 1100. This embodiment includes irradiating a sample with light, wherein the sample may be one or more of any of the types of samples mentioned herein, and assessing the Raman-shifted scattered radiation emanating from multiple points of the sample (e.g., two, four, five, ten, fifty, one hundred, or more). The points may be, for example, single pixels of an image of the viewing field or areas of the field represented in an image by multiple adjacent or grouped pixels. The shape (e.g., circular, annular, rectangular, etc.) of areas or pixels assessed as individual points is not critical. The multiple points have a defined geometric relationship with each other and the Raman-shifted scattered radiation is characteristic of the presence or absence of, for example, a hazardous agent in the sample. For example, Raman-shifted scattered radiation emanating from three, six, or ten points may be assessed. The points in the sample may be collinear, lie along two intersecting lines, be radially equidistant from a central point, or arranged otherwise, such as a random distribution not determinable from the image. Since the analysis or assessment of the Raman-shifted scattered radiation may only be performed on the particular points of the sample, and because the points of the sample may represent less than the entire field of view of the sample, the speed of analyzing the Raman-shifted scattered radiation is significantly increased. For example, the particular points of the sample may only represent 25% of the field of view, 5%, 1%, or even less., 129169=Device 100 may be configured to illuminate or irradiate the sample and collect and analyze photons emitted or scatted by the sample. Analysis and identification can be accomplished as a function of the wavelengths emitted or scattered by the sample (i.e., the spectra of the sample). Thus, a spectra similar to that produced by a spectrometer can be obtained. In another embodiment, The principles disclosed herein are particularly advantageous in that device 1100 enables obtaining spatially resolved images as well as spectral identification of a sample simultaneously. In another embodiment, the disclosure relates to a portable system for obtaining a spatially accurate wavelength-resolved image of a sample having a first and a second spatial dimension. The portable system can include a photon emission source for sequentially illuminating a plurality of portions of said sample with a plurality of photons to produce photons scattered by the sample. The photon emission source can illuminate the sample along the first spatial dimension for each of plural predetermined positions of the second spatial dimension. The system may also include an optical lens for collecting the scattered photons to produce therefrom filtered photons, a dispersive spectrometer for determining a wavelength of ones of the filtered photons, a photon detector for receiving the filtered photons and obtaining therefrom plural spectra of said sample, and a processor for producing a two dimensional image of said sample from the plural spectra., 119012=The Fabry-Perot filter element not only transmits but in an alternate embodiment can reflect the light to an individual pixel of a CMOS sensor to form a single wavelength Raman or luminescence imaging object 1020 of spatially accurate spectrally resolved pixels of the sample. That is, in an alternative embodiment one or more Fabry-Perot filter elements can be used as a reflective wavelength filter rather than a transmissive one., 115784=For Raman, Fluorescence, Visible or NIR operation a particular arrangement of stacks of the plates can be used for which a predetermined set of actuator voltages are known that provide the required wavelength filtering characteristic. For the particular mode of operation the required set of voltages are then called by the computer and applied to the actuators for each wavelength to be imaged. Scanning a set of actuators and acquiring the data over the full image 1020 creates the wavelength resolved spatially accurate image., 116353=Preferably, a 2-D image (X, Y) image of the sample is produced on the detector 1020. The tunable optical cavities produce the image at one wavelength at a time and are controllable for tuning to two or more wavelengths and optionally to selected wavelengths in a range. The tuning speed can be less than 1 sec for changing between cavity spacings and thus selecting for an image at a new wavelength., 171002=The sample vial 1810 may be utilized as follows. A sample 1801 of a suspicious powder, for example, is collected from an incident scene. The sample is placed into the vial 1810 and the plunger 1814 is inserted into the vial. The plunger 1814 forms a seal with the inside walls of the vial 1810 so that when the plunger is inserted into the vial the sample is forced against the optical window 12 at the base of the vial. The air that was present in the vial 1810 when the plunger 1814 is first inserted into the vial is forced through the filter element 1816 at the base of the plunger and exits via the hollow center portion of the plunger. The filter element 1816 can be any known filter element that can perform the necessary filtration function of allowing the air initially in the vial 1810 to escape the decreasing volume formed between the bottom of the plunger 1814 and the walls and optical window 1812 of the vial 1810. At this point, all, or substantially all, of the sample is confined in a narrow volume at the base of the vial 1810 up against the optical window 1812, having been forced down by the insertion of the plunger 1814. All, or substantially all, the air that was initially present in the vial 1810 when the plunger 1814 was first inserted into the vial has been filtered out of the system via the filter element 1816 and the hollow center portion of the plunger., 181729=The above-described analysis system 1905 may be used by military and municipal first responder organizations to detect the presence of hazardous biothreat agents in many forms including powders, solid residues, and liquids. Coupled with the use of a suitable surface sampler, the analysis system may be used in the determination of surface contamination. Furthermore, coupled with an air sampler/concentrator, the analysis system may be used in the determination of airborne contamination., 177328=The analysis system may preferably be a portable device and more preferably a handheld device and may operate on battery power so as to be available for use in the field. An exemplary configuration may include one or more of the following specifications: weight of less than 5 pounds, overall volume of less than 1 cubic foot, capable of being handheld, operating and storage temperature of 32-150\ufffd F., operating and storage humidity of 5-95% relative humidity, battery life capable of a minimum of 50-100 tests, an input device/display unit comprising a touch screen display capable of operation by the user when wearing bulky gloves, detection time of less than 2 minutes, and a probability of a false positive of less than 0.001. The sample container 1805 may be used once, or a few times, and then disposed of and another one used I its place., 112444=Optical plates 1010 can be fabricated from a planar Si wafer and the wafer can be configured to form a supporting frame by micro-machining steps, for example using chemical or ion beam etching. By additional processing steps known to those skilled in the art, connecting members are formed between the supporting frame and the thin substantially reflective Si plate (e.g., along the sides and corners of each Si filter element) so as to provide electronically controllable positioning actuators for setting the cavity thickness(es). These actuators (not shown) move one or both optical plates 1010 in pairs defining the Fabry-Perot interferometers. The plates 1010 can be moved uniformly in and out of the plane of the respective supporting frame (i.e., in a direction parallel to the optical axis and normal to the parallel planes of the optical plates), for setting the cavity thicknesses as indicated by the arrows., 178215=The analysis system 1905 may be based on the CHITA system which is a specialized handheld Raman detector which may employ a spatially-resolved, multipoint approach which may be implemented through the use of a large diameter laser spot on the sample, a dichroic mirror/long pass filter pair for rejection of the Rayleigh-scattered illuminating photons, and optics to focus the Raman light onto the end of a two-dimensional array of fiber optic fibers 1960. At the other end of the fiber optic bundle, the fibers may be arrayed in a one-dimensional line arranged at the entrance slit of a spectrometer 1970. The spectrum at each fiber may be captured on a two-dimensional CCD detector 1970 located at the focal plane of the spectrometer. An on-board computer 1974 may read the detector output and the acquired spectrum may then be processed, searched against an internally-stored library of spectra in memory device 1972, and the results displayed to an operator on a display unit 1976., 131283=In another embodiment, the device 1100 may be modified by the addition of a Fiber Array Spectral Transmitter (\u201cFAST\u201d) system. The FAST system can provide faster real-time analysis for rapid detection, classification, identification, and visualization of, for example, hazardous agents, biological warfare agents, chemical warfare agents, and pathogenic microorganisms, as well as non-threatening objects, elements, and compounds. FAST technology can acquire a few to thousands of full spectral range, spatially resolved spectra simultaneously, This may be done by focusing a spectroscopic image onto a two-dimensional array of optical fibers that are drawn into a one-dimensional distal array with, for example, serpentine ordering. The one-dimensional fiber stack is coupled to an imaging spectrograph. Software is used to extract the spectral/spatial information that is embedded in a single CCD image frame. Fiber array spectroscopic imaging has been demonstrated in several applications including Raman chemical imaging analysis of micro-composites and biomaterials and time-resolved atomic emission chemical imaging of laser-induced plumes.}",
