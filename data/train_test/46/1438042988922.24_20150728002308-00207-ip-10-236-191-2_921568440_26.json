            "The cafeteria has so many options aside from the main school campus cafe. The University hosts a Starbucks, Auntie Anne's, Taco Bell, Chick Fillet, and much more.",
            "I do not live on campus, however the ones I've been in are quite nice. They are located in a beautiful wooded area and cops patrol regularly making residents feel safe.",
            "Sounds silly, but make ratemyprofessor.com your best friend. Prior to SIUE, I took that site for granted. To me, how the teacher presents a class is everything. A good teacher is the key to success, and with that website, you can't go wrong.",
            "To be honest, I'm not happy with my decision to attend SIUE. I've had terrible luck with teachers and advisors; I've gotten very little help from anyone when I needed it. I honestly can not wait to transfer out of SIUE."

There's also a rumor on campus about a Panara Bread for the 2012-2013 year., 252751=Tuition is only 2900 per semester, with fees it comes around to about 4000 a semester which isn't bad at all for a University. You get a great education for a low tuition cost., 439266=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 334446=Parties and chilling with friends in the dorms. Without a car, you won't be able to enjoy having fun off campus after a certain time of the day because the buses leaving and coming back to campus stop after about 5:00 pm}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students The campus is absolutely gorgeous and the longest walk you will have is about 10-15 minutes depending on how fast (or slow) you walk. The school is currently being changed from Division II to Division I, so the Vadalabene Center (the gym and fitness complex) is being expanded. The campus has a lot to offer for students, and security is great (it seems a bit over the top sometimes, but it's for our safety).
