The paging channel 60 is comprised of 2048 paging channel slots, numbered 0 through 2047, of which paging channel slots 72, 74, and 76 are examples. These 2048 paging channel slots are transmitted over the air and are repeated once all 2048 slots are transmitted. Each paging channel slot 74 is comprised of eight paging channel half frames, numbered 0 through 7, of which paging channel half slots 78, 80, 82, 84, and 86 are examples. Paging channel messages, for example, 88, 90, and 92 are transmitted on the paging channel half frame. Paging channel messages may be either synchronized 90, which means that they begin on a paging channel half frame boundary, or the messages may be unsynchronized 92 when the message does not begin on a paging channel half frame boundary. Unsynchronized paging channel messages 92 also contain a pad field 96 of unspecified length to align the end of the unsynchronized paging channel message 92 with the end of a paging channel half frame. Synchronized paging channel messages 90 do not contain a pad field. Each paging channel message, regardless if they are synchronized 90 or unsynchronized 92, are made up of a message length field 98, a message body field 100, and a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) field 102.}",
