No. 932,232, filed Aug. 9, 1978., 23391=The process of fabrication of the device of FIG. 4 begins after the standard formation of base or substrate 10, layer 12 and surface region 14. To form the device of FIG. 4, layer 10 is a substrate of an N conductivity type having an impurity concentration of, for example, 1018 to 1020 atoms per cubic centimeter, layer 12 may be an epitaxial layer of P conductivity type having an impurity concentration of, for example, 1014 to 1016 atoms per cubic centimeter, and surface region 14 may be formed by selectively diffusing impurities, for example, phosphorous, arsenic or antimony, into the surface of a layer 12 to have an impurity concentration level of greater than 1019 atoms per cubic centimeter. Although illustrated as a substrate 10 and an epitaxial layer 12 and a diffused region 14, it is obvious that these regions may be formed by other methods. For example, the body region 12 may be formed by diffusing P type impurities into a N type substrate followed by the diffusion of N type impurities into region 12 to form surface region 14. Also, region 14 could be a second epitaxial layer.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes It are evident from the description above that the objects of the invention are obtained in that a vertical insulated gate field effect transistor is provided having a minimum channel length L and drain depth xJD. Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is to be clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation. The spirit and scope of the invention is to be limited only by the terms of the appended claims. The device of FIGS. 4 or 5 incorporating the principles of the present invention may be formed to have a channel length L of less than 0.5 microns and a drain depth xJD of less than 0.1 microns. This is compared to a channel length L of approximately 0.5 microns and a drain depth xJD of greater than 3 microns for FIG. 3. Subsequent to the final etching, an insulative layer 20 is formed in the groove and gate layer 18 is formed thereon. For example, the substrate may be silicon, the insulating layer 20 may be silicon dioxide and the gate metal 18 may be aluminum. Although the gate is illustrated as having a single insulating layer 20 and a single gate layer 18, it may be made to have three layers, for example, a silicon nitride layer therebetween.
