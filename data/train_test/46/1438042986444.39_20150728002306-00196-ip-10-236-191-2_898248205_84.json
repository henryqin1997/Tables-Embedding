            "On campus there are blue lights where you can hit them and a police officer will get there asap. They're also in sight of each other so if you feel you're being stalked or chased you can tag the buttons in a line and the police will get to the next one. With that said there are incidents still, and they will be sent out in emails and txt alerts to keep students safe. The Fort (Fort Sanders - the area across Cumberland aka The Strip) does get dangerous at late night mostly due to the low income nature of the area and large amount of homeless persons. The saying goes what happens in the Fort tonight will be in the Email tomorrow! Just don't walk alone really is the biggest thing off of campus.",
            "While I'm not greek, some of my friends and both of my siblings are. Some greeks are obnoxious about being such and like to cause a scene and make all greek groups. But really a lot of them are fine with whoever. Also greek life is really large here if you are interested in doing it, yet it isn't like some SEC colleges where you won't be able to find a fun and interesting group of people if you don't.",
            "There are so many clubs and groups it's mind boggling. If you have an interest - no matter what it is - there is a group or club for you to join and get into.",
            "If you enjoy being social as well as being a student looking for a great education and opportunity. Life at UT is what you make it and there is a niche for really any type of student.",
            "The best tradition by far is painting the Rock. Grab some spray paint and some friends and paint it up! Also be sure to watch the Vol Walk at least once - it's the parade around campus before the football games with the band, coaches and players, and lots more.",
            "It's an SEC school so there are tons of great athletic events to go to, including saturday football in Neyland Stadium. The streets on campus all the way up through the fort are orange and white!",
            "There are lots of groups and things to do on campus, especially as a freshman. There's the TREC which has a outdoor pool, workout facility with one of everything. Also, HPER (Next to Trec above track field - called hyper) is also a work out facility that is less crowded. On the other entrance of HPER there is a rock wall where you can rent shoes and everything. There's the Outdoor Program which functions out of the TREC facility that goes camping, backpacking, kayaking, and all that good stuff. Also you can rent outdoor equipment for super cheap, some stuff is even free to rent. If that isn't you there are so many clubs and organizations from religious groups, student activist groups, and of course greek life.",
            "Getting a meal plan is great, it's like eating for free. Use your meals too and save your dinning dollars till the end of the spring semester because by then the cafeteria food that was great in the fall begins to get worse and it starts to all look the same. Also, if you have morning classes I would suggest getting breakfast, it's not the best but it is good and will keep you alert and ready for class.",
            "When you first move into the dorms life is amazing. Everyone is ready to meet new people, and everything is new. You won't even care how old and cheaply constructed the dorms are. Everything is so close, and with a meal plan it's like eating free all the time. However after winter break and being reminded what real food and comfort is, the dorms begin to look like what they really are. But don't worry after it gets warm everyone is outside in presidential court yard again and life is great. The RA's are pretty cool and usually relaxed about most rules. Also a little tip, cover the air ducts to keep the dorm circulated air out so you wont get sick when the viruses and all begin. Also you better get a room fan, the AC isn't great, and the heat stays on until late spring.",
            "At UT life is what you make it, and that is especially true with your academics. You can take 12 hours a semester and not graduate on time, or work 20 hours a week on top a 17+ hour semester. What you take and when you take it also makes the difficulty change greatly. Balance is key, try and take something that interests you and something that challenges you. If you sign up for a easy semester, you will end up taking a semester that will make you question your sanity and intelligence the following semester. All the courses here have the possibility to be incredibly hard or fairly simple. Some general education requirements may whip you and some upper level courses you may laugh at, but still take everything seriously - it pays off later.",
            "Get involved! Go to class, and master even the basics - you can not begin to understand how much this will help down the line. At UT you have an unbelievably capable faculty who mostly are more than available and would like to get to know you as well as help you as much as they can. Even general education courses are taught by professors that can offer insight as well as opportunities. Being a SEC school athletic events are fun and great ways to meet new people and life on campus is great. With that said however keep school your first priority! Get involved and explore opportunities through other students, professors, and advisors.",
            "At the University of Tennessee - Knoxville, life is what you make of it. You can party and live it up, or you can be a part of ground breaking research and create a better world. Being a SEC school provides a good opportunity but being enrolled in Tennessee's flagship and only land-grant research college is a great opportunity."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{672297=The seal on Pedestrian Parkway is said to be cursed, and anyone who steps on it is said to take longer than 4 years to graduate. The Hill on campus is historic, and has been around since 1794. It is where a lot of science and math classrooms are located. There is the pass the torch ceremony for incoming freshmen. You sit with your entire freshman class in an auditorium and listen to a presentation by your administration. Once this presentation is over, everyone lights an individual candle. It's a really neat experience., 882229=University of Tennessee is a public institution that was founded in 1794. It has a total undergraduate enrollment of 21,214, its setting is urban, and the campus size is 560 acres. USNEWS Report ranks University of Tennessee no. 101 best university in the nation. The school is located in Knoxville, one of the state\u00e2??s largest cities, and is the flagship campus for the state school. Close to 40 percent of students join a fraternity or sorority. The UT sports teams are known as the Vols and the Lady Vols, short for Volunteers. The teams compete in the NCAA Division I Southeastern Conference, and football season is a particularly big draw at the school., 212488=Apply before November 1! Definitly increases your chances of scholarships., 693145=They serve breakfast till 2:30 on weekends!, 744585=the whole campus is a tradition--Big Orange Country, Rocky Top. UT is one of the oldest colleges in the country, founded in 1794. everybody knows Rocky Top, and you'll sing it a lot in the fall., 842803=The University of Tennessee has a special alert system set up for cell phones that alerts students when something is happening on campus. I have never felt unsafe on campus, and often times, I am walking alone back to my dorm well after 10:30 p.m. All walkways are always well lit, and campus blue lights are set up everywhere., 988643=I don't like it at all. My friend loves the pizza though, so some people are cool with it. It's expensive, with crappy dining times (like 7-8:30 weekdays/Sunday and 8-2 on Saturday...) and the food is barely ample. I am a bit pickier though., 490300=Since 2007, campus safety has improved greatly! There is a text/email system so that anytime the UTPD are called, all students, faculty, staff, and even parents are notified. Another great thing I love about UTPD is that they are REAL police men and women. I feel protected knowing they could protect me., 663160=I love my roommate and my living situation. The bathrooms stay clean. I just wish we could have heat before the middle of November. It's getting cold in here., 66289=Come for a visit and just have fun. Come with your friends to the campus doesn't feel so large when you first come. When school starts, don't stay in your room, go out and meet everybody cause the fist week is where everybody is new and looking for new friends. Also if your a freshman, get a meal plan (10 meals, not unlimited because you don't get very many dining dollars) and stay in a dorm. Carrick is a great dorm because you share two rooms with 3 other people and this building is in the middle of presidential court which is where everybody hangs out and is where some of the food is. Apply early, either November 1 (for scholarship opportunities) or December 1 (application deadline). Also bring winter clothes after fall break, but keep some summer ones because the weather is really weird here. Also do bring an umbrella and or rain coat because it rains a lot. Bring some good tennis shoes because you walk everywhere everyday and flip flops will hurt you feet after a while., 1038313=1982 World Fair Park, Market Square and Krutch Park, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, West Town Mall, Holy Land Market on Sutherland Ave., McClung Museum (my favorite place on campus; I've attended free lectures for the public from really intersting people like photojournalist Chris Rainier and egyptologist Salima Ikram), the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra, country stars in concert on campus, the Dogwood Arts Festival in the Spring, tailgate parties during football season, SEC games, clubbing on the Strip... Cute little towns like Downtown Dandridge are in close driving distance. Visit the TVA dams if you want to go to the lake. Go fishing. Drive to Pigeon Forge or Gatlinburg if you want to do something touristy. Go to Dollywood or Ripley's Aquarium, or go skiing ir ride the sky lift or the really big ferris wheel in Pigeon Forge. And Atlanta, Nashville, and Chattanooga are all a few hours away., 50184=The people on campus and off are amazing, I have never in my life met such kind people! Everyone at U.T. is very helpful, I am going on my official guided 'tour' in April, however, my first visit to U.T. I went on a self-guided tour with my family. My first visit was a bit overwhelming, but a few students took the time out of their busy schedules to show me some of their favorite spots! Go Vols!, 1089527=I lived in Clement my freshman year, it's being remodeled so it won't be open until fall 2015 but I highly recommend it. However, if you're a freshman I would definitely say living in Pres Court will help you meet people and it's a lot closer to the dining hall. UT is in the process of upgrading the on-campus housing in the next few years and from what they've shown us it's gonna be awesome., 864240=There are only a couple of dorms that are really nice, but they are for upperclassman and they fill up ridiculously quick. They just raised their prices this year (2013-2014), so it is now even more expensive to live on campus (about $700 a month). While living on campus is a lot easier and allows you to walk to classes, living off campus is cheaper and has more amenities. Also, commuter parking passes cost less than non-commuter ones, and you can always take the campus busses from your parking area to your classes., 897048=I've had great professors at UT but I've also had a lot of TAs, and I hate that I'm paying so much for tuition and not getting actual professors. There's a lot of construction going on which makes it more difficult to get around campus. Also, they raised tuition 6% again this year, which means they've raised it 26% since I started at UT in 2010., 1066507=Live in presidential courtyard or in the new dorm being built now (today is April 10, 2014, I'm not sure when it will be ready.) Come into school as undecided unless you're really sure what you want to study. I didn't declare a major until Junior year, and I'm still graduating on time. Get involved with extracurricular activities early. You will make great connections and a lot of new friends., 164294=I had a 3.7 GPA, a 23 on my ACT, and a 1480 SAT score and I got in just fine, but there are some requirements., 69059=I am learning so much at The University of Tennessee so far. I just started in the Fall of 2010 and feel like I have learned more than I ever did in high school. My hardest class for the fall semester was Geology (planetary bodies) because the concepts are just difficult to wrap your head around but I learned so much about other planets. I also took a math class that went over everything that was taught in high school and I feel that this will help me in my next 3.5 years and even later in life. My funnest class by far was communication studies. The teacher was vey laid back and the class felt like a family. We did numerous speeches and to be honest I was super nervous at first, but as the semester went on, I felt good when I was in front of everybody. You will definitely learn a lot here at UT and each year it gets harder and harder to get into the school. At times it will be challenging, but you will learn so much here!, 776549=The campus is very safe. I don't have to worry about getting around on campus at any time of the day, whether it's my 8 am class or my 6:45 pm class that ends at 8:35 pm. There are Emergency Call points all throughout campus as well that can be used by anyone, student or not, to instantly call for help or assistance if needed., 1013588=I plan to attend UT in aug. 2014 I have been to the campus on a site visit and I am so looking forward to my future here. Now I am hoping to find some scholarship monies.}",

Login to rate or flag the reviews Suzanna from Knoxville, TN 12/30/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 18 out of 18 people found this review useful. 3 of 239 Categories Comments Great for these types of students The University of Tennessee is great for in-state students because of the HOPE scholarship. It's great for students who want to experience living on their own with the comfort of still being able to visit home for the weekend if they so desire. It's a school with a lot of people, so if you're looking for the most personal academic attention, it's probably not your best bet. It's wonderful for students who want to live in a moderately-sized city with lots to do. Tips for prospective students If you're going to take a night class, be sure",
