These regularly collected data sets are collectively categorized as the monitoring sets 27 (shown in FIG. 1). In addition, select device and derived measures sets 24 a and quality of life and symptom measures sets 25 a can be designated as a reference baseline 26 at the outset of patient care to improve the accuracy and meaningfulness of the serial monitoring sets 27. Select patient information is collected, recorded, and derived during an initial period of observation or patient care, such as described in the related, commonly-owned U.S. patent application, Ser. No. 09/361,332, pending, filed Jul. 26, 1999, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference., 125273=The telemetered signals stored in the implantable medical device 12 are preferably retrieved upon the completion of an initial observation period and subsequently thereafter on a continuous, periodic (daily) basis, such as described in the related, commonly-owned U.S. patent application, Ser. No. 09/361,332, pending, filed Jul. 26, 1999, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. A programmer 14, personal computer 18, or similar device for communicating with an implantable medical device 12 can be used to retrieve the telemetered signals. A magnetized reed switch (not shown) within the implantable medical device 12 closes in response to the placement of a wand 13 over the site of the implantable medical device 12. The programmer 14 sends programming or interrogating instructions to and retrieves stored telemetered signals from the implantable medical device 12 via RF signals exchanged through the wand 13. Similar communication means are used for accessing the external medical device 26. Once downloaded, the telemetered signals are sent via an internetwork 15, such as the Internet, to a server system 16 which periodically receives and stores the telemetered signals as device measures in patient care records 23 in a database 17, is further described below, by way of example, with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3. An exemplary programmer 14 suitable for use in the present invention is the Model 2901 Programmer Recorder Monitor, manufactured by Guidant Corporation, Indianapolis, Ind., 154385=Thus, if other disorders or diseases are being cross-referenced and diagnosed (block 141), their status is determined (block 142). In the described embodiment, the operations of ordering and prioritizing multiple near-simultaneous disorders (box 151) by the testing of threshold limits and analysis in a manner similar to congestive heart failure as described above, preferably in parallel to the present determination, is described in the related, commonly-owned U.S. patent application, Ser. No. 09/441,405, entitled \u201cAutomated Collection And Analysis Patient Care System And Method For Ordering And Prioritizing Multiple Health Disorders To Identify An Index Disorder,\u201d pending, filed Nov. 16, 1999, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. If myocardial ischemia is due to an obvious inciting cause, i.e., secondary myocardial ischemia, (block 143), an appropriate treatment regimen for myocardial ischemia as exacerbated by other disorders is adopted that includes treatment of secondary disorders, e.g., myocardial ischemia, respiratory insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, and so forth (block 144) and a suitable patient status indicator 127 for myocardial ischemia is provided (block 146) to the patient. Suitable devices and approaches to diagnosing and treating congestive heart failure, respiratory distress and atrial fibrillation are described in related, commonly-owned U.S. patent applications, Ser. No. 09/441,623, entitled \u201cAutomated Collection And Analysis Patient Care System And Method For Diagnosing And Monitoring Congestive Heart Failure And Outcomes Thereof,\u201d pending, filed Nov. 16, 1999; Ser. No.09/442,125, entitled \u201cAutomated Collection And Analysis Patient Care System And Method For Diagnosing And Monitoring Respiratory Insufficiency And Outcomes Thereof,\u201d pending, filed Nov. 16, 1999; and Ser. No. 09/441,613, entitled \u201cAutomated Collection And Analysis Patient Care System And Method For Diagnosing And Monitoring The Outcomes Of Atrial Fibrillation, \u201d pending, filed Nov. 16, 1999, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference., 106354=This patent application is related to a commonly owned U.S. patent application, Ser. No. 09/448,405 entitled \u201cAutomated Collection And Analysis Patient Care System And Method For Ordering And Prioritizing Multiple Health Disorders To Identify An Index Disorder,\u201d pending, filed Nov. 16, 1999, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference., 181592=Note also that an inversion of the indicator thresholds 129 defined above could similarly be used for detecting a trend in disease regression. One skilled in the art would recognize that these measures would vary based on whether or not they were recorded during rest or during activity and that the measured activity score can be used to indicate the degree of patient rest or activity. The patient activity score can be determined via an implantable motion detector, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,428,378, issued Jan. 31, 1984, to Anderson et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference., 123579=FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing an automated collection and analysis patient care system 10 for diagnosing and monitoring myocardial ischemia in accordance with the present invention. An exemplary automated collection and analysis patient care system suitable for use with the present invention is disclosed in the related, commonly-owned U.S. patent application, Ser. No. 09/324,894, pending, filed Jun. 3, 1999, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Preferably, an individual patient 11 is a recipient of an implantable medical device 12, such as, by way of example, an IPG, cardiovascular or heart failure monitor, or therapeutic device, with a set of leads extending into his or her heart and electrodes implanted throughout the cardiopulmonary system. Alternatively, an external monitoring or therapeutic medical device 26, a subcutaneous monitor or device inserted into other organs, a cutaneous monitor, or even a manual physiological measurement device, such as an electrocardiogram or heart rate monitor, could be used. The implantable medical device 12 and external medical device 26 include circuitry for recording into a short-term, volatile memory telemetered signals stored for later retrieval, which become part of a set of device and derived measures, such as described below, by way of example, with reference to FIG. 2. Exemplary implantable medical devices suitable for use in the present invention include the Discovery line of pacemakers, manufactured by Guidant Corporation, Indianapolis, Ind., and the Gem line of ICDs, manufactured by Medtronic Corporation, Minneapolis, Minn., 148908=Referring back to FIG. 5, the analysis module 131 analyzes the results from the comparison module 130, which are stored as a combined measures set 95 (not shown), to a set of indicator thresholds 129, as further described below with reference to FIGS. 8A-8B. Similarly, the quality of life module 132 compares quality of life and symptom measures 25 a, 25 b from the reference baseline 26 and monitoring sets 27, the results of which are incorporated into the comparisons performed by the comparison module 13, in part, to either refute or support the findings based on physiological \u201chard\u201d data. Finally, the feedback module 128 provides automated feedback to the individual patient based, in part, on the patient status indicator 127 generated by the diagnostic module 126. As described above, the feedback could be by electronic mail or by automated voice mail or facsimile. The feedback can also include normalized voice feedback, such as described in the related, commonly-owned U.S. patent application, Ser. No. 09/361,777, pending, filed Jul. 26, 1999, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, the feedback module 128 determines whether any changes to interventive measures are appropriate based on threshold stickiness (\u201chysteresis\u201d) 133, as further described below with reference to FIG. 16. The threshold stickiness 133 can prevent fickleness in diagnostic routines resulting from transient, non-trending and non-significant fluctuations in the various collected and derived measures in favor of more certainty in diagnosis. In a further embodiment of the present invention, the feedback module 128 includes a patient query engine 134 which enables the individual patient 11 to interactively query the server system 16 regarding the diagnosis, therapeutic maneuvers, and treatment regimen. Conversely, the patient query engines 134 can be found in interactive expert systems for diagnosing medical conditions can interactively query the patient. Using the personal computer 18 (shown in FIG. 1), the patient can have an interactive dialogue with the automated server system 16, as well as human experts as necessary, to self assess his or her medical condition. Such expert systems are well known in the art, an example of which is the MYCIN expert system developed at Stanford University and described in Buchanan, B. & Shortlife, E., \u201cRULE-BASED EXPERT SYSTEMS. The MYCIN Experiments of the Stanford Heuristic Programming Project,\u201d Addison-Wesley (1984). The various forms of feedback described above help to increase the accuracy and specificity of the reporting of the quality of life and symptomatic measures., 111036=Alternatively, these telemetered signals can be remotely collected and analyzed using an automated patient care system. One such system is described in a related, commonly owned U.S. patent application, Ser. No. 09/434,894, filed Jun. 3, 1999, pending, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. A medical device adapted to be implanted in an individual patient records telemetered signals that are then retrieved on a regular, periodic basis using an interrogator or similar interfacing device. The telemetered signals are downloaded via an internetwork onto a network server on a regular, e.g., daily, basis and stored as sets of collected measures in a database along with other patient care records. The information is then analyzed in an automated fashion and feedback, which includes a patient status indicator, is provided to the patient.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets While the invention has been particularly shown and described as referenced to the embodiments thereof, those skilled in the art will understand that the foregoing and other changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Other benefits include an automated, expert system approach to the cross-referral, consideration, and potential finding or elimination of other diseases and health disorders with similar or related etiological indicators and for those other disorders that may have an impact on myocardial ischemia. Although disease specific markers will prove very useful in discriminating the underlying cause of symptoms, many diseases, other than myocardial ischemia, will alter some of the same physiological measures indicative of myocardial ischemia. Consequently, an important aspect of considering the potential impact of other disorders will be, not only the monitoring of disease specific markers, but the sequencing of change and the temporal evolution of more general physiological measures, for example heart rate, ECG ST-T wave changes, pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, and cardiac output, to reflect disease onset, progression or regression in more than one type of disease process. The present invention provides several benefits. One benefit is improved predictive accuracy from the outset of patient care when a reference baseline is incorporated into the automated diagnosis. Another benefit is an expanded knowledge base created by expanding the methodologies applied to a single patient to include patient",
