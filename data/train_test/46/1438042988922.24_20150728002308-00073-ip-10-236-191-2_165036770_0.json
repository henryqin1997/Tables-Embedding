    "textBeforeTable": "(Listed in alphabetical order) Bitcoin ASIC Mining Hardware So, now onto what is being offered. \u00a0The\u00a0criteria\u00a0to get onto this list was quite simple, if I could find a pre-order form for the device it made the list. \u00a0The information that is available for each offering is quite\u00a0sparse\u00a0so I chose to only include the name, price, GH/s (1,000,000,000 Hash\u2019s per second) and how many GH/s each of your\u00a0dollar\u00a0buys, feel free to use the links provided to find out more information directly from the\u00a0supplier. While the cost for each individual ASIC is also quite low, sometimes even measured in cents for large orders of hundreds of thousands of individual units the cost to design, prototype and manufacture a single ASIC is measured in the millions so while the cost to the manufacturer for an individual unit may be low they still need to recoup those millions. ASCI\u2019s bitcoin miners on the other hand are built ground up and fully optimised to do those complicated SHA256 computations at rates that\u00a0totally\u00a0obsoletes any mining technology seen to date at a fraction of the running cost. ASCI\u2019s are chips designed to do one thing and one thing only, but they do that particular task very well. \u00a0When it come to talking about bitcoin up until now (or more\u00a0precisely\u00a0shortly from now) people have mined with general purpose processors designed to do other tasks such as the CPU and GPU in your computer, while they can mine for bitcoins that is not what they",
    "textAfterTable": "As you can see there is something to fit just about any budget from the hardcore enterprise miner all the way down to the\u00a0hobbyist. It is also very important to note again, none of these devices are available yet. \u00a0You are able to\u00a0pre order them though but do so at your own risk. Disclaimer: I have\u00a0absolutely\u00a0no relationship with any of the ASIC companies mentioned in this article, I neither\u00a0recommend\u00a0or\u00a0recommend against any particular vendor or device. Authors Note: Since I run mining equipment for my clients there may be a conflict of\u00a0interest\u00a0here, I have tried to keep this as impartial as\u00a0possible\u00a0though, judge for yourself. Update:\u00a0transisto over on Reddit points out that\u00a0organofcorti has also written two articles on ASIC choices as well, I have read them and they are very good. \u00a0They are a bit more technical than I try to present, but if you\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0mind they are well worth the read.",
