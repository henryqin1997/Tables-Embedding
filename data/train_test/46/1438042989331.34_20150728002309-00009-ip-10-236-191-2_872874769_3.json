An artistic 107 against England at Lord's and a double hundred against a decent South African attack at Galle were just some of the highlights of his career during this period. In 2006, he was made captain for Sri Lanka's Bangladesh tour after regular skipper Marvan Atapattu was ruled out with a back injury. He then led a young Sri Lankan side to complete a 5-0 whitewash of England in an ODI series and draw level in the Test series. The fact that it was achieved in England; a country where few Asian countries had succeeded was a testimony to Jayawardene's leadership qualities. After a brief stint with captaincy that included a place in the 2007 World Cup final, he stepped down in 2009 with a view to concentrate on his batting. However, the responsibility returned to him in 2011-12 after he took over from Tillakaratne Dilshan. The skipper tried his best to help Sri Lanka win their maiden World Twenty20 title in 2012 but had to settle with the runners-up position. Following the debacle, Jayawardene relinquished his T20I captaincy, while continuing to captain in Tests and ODIs. He finally stepped down as a leader from all formats of the game in 2013, post the Australia series., 27794=The maestro called it curtains to his limited overs career after failing to take Sri Lanka past the quarter-final mark in the 2015 ICC World Cup. He had retired from Tests in 2014., 25150=Jayawardene captained his school's Under-13 side, playing at the pivotal number three position. With his wonderful, flowing technique and his penchant for big runs, he quickly became one of the most promising players at school level. He made his debut for Sinhalese Sports Club in 1995 and after slamming four centuries in the 1997-98 season, was fast tracked into Sri Lanka's Test squad. He made an impressive debut against India, carving a neat 66-run knock in a game in which Sri Lanka piled a record-breaking 952-6. He made his ODI debut in 1998 and scored a fine 74 in only his second game. However his breakthrough innings was a fluent 167 against New Zealand on a Galle pitch so treacherous that Stephen Fleming labelled it as a 'dung heap'.}",
