These books were as follows:, 6572=HBMa 1226, 6102=Marriages (O) 1874\u20131916, 32645=Copyright \u00a92015 Bob Lenk.\u00a0 Updated 09-May-2015, BL., 21134=12529 births with 844 different family names 7320 deaths with 668 different family names 1940 marriages with 394 different family names, 18022=The first section of the F-R is the birth index, starting in 1767 and providing first name, family name and year of birth, as well as usually the names of the father and mother. The section containing the marriage index starts in 1798 and gives first and family names of the marriage partners and the year of the marriage. The final section is the death index, which starts in 1798 and gives year of death and age, and sometimes also the name of the father, mother or spouse, or the profession. All the dates provided in the F-R are years, and not the days or the months. The handwritten script is generally very legible., 19360=1798\u20131845, 13267=The archival section moved in 2004 to the building of the former synagogue of Sm\u00edchov, in the south-west of Prague. This synagogue, originally opened in 1863, was used as a storeroom for Jewish items during the Nazi occupation. In the 1990s, it was renovated. The archival material of the Jewish Museum, much of which had been previously kept in a store house outside Prague, was moved into the mainbuilding of the former synagogue. There is a study room for researchers. Requested material is brought by Dr Hama\u010dkov\u00e1, head of the archives in the Jewish Museum, or her colleagues., 20459=1873 onwards, 5972=HBMa 1224, 6176=HBMa 1225, 4287=Marriages (O) 1874\u20131916, 6454=HBMa 1234, 5851=HBMa 1231, 5372=HBMa 1222, 4156=Marriages (O) 1849\u20131873, 6308=Deaths (Z) 1848\u20131873, 4371=HBMa 1226, 4499=HBMa 1227, 25559=These three books are all entitled \u201cKniha ob\u0159izek, zlomek\u201d \u2013 circumcision books (excerpts). Number 9 runs from 1805 to 1854; number 10 from 1849 to 1875; and number 11 from 1866 to 1876. There is thus an overlap in the period covered between nos. 9 and 10, and between nos. 10 and 11., 24684=There is a gap between May 1831 and April 1832. Also, as the birth registers for Mikulov in the National Archives begin only in 1850, there is another gap in available detailed birth data between August 1847 and the end of 1849. The Familien-Register, however, should at least cover both those gaps in indexed form., 4109=HBMa 1224, 27936=The Provincial, or Regional, Archives for Southern Moravia are located in Brno. Their holdings include several lists or censuses of the Jews of Nikolsburg from the late 16th, 17th, 18th, and early 19th centuries. The earliest of these list only given names, often without even patrinomes, and thus are very difficult to connect to any genealogical lines. Surnames begin to appear, and quickly become the norm, in the mid- to late 17th century. Transcriptions of several, perhaps all, of these censuses are available through the \u201cProjekt Bohemia, Moravia et Silesia Judaica\u201d at their website www.bmsj.eu. Access to the transcripts requires a paid membership. The website is available in Czech and German, and it includes a number of other historical records from Nikolsburg which are of less general use for genealogical research. A few of the censuses are also transcribed, at least in part, in the article by Bruno Mauritz Trapp in Hugo Gold's book on the Jewish Communities of Moravia. Those names are included in this index; the article is cited in our bibliography. There are some discrepencies between these two secondary sources. In particular, there is one census that Trapp lists for the year 1657, while BMSJ attributes it to 1673. We believe the BMSJ date to be correct, but have not confirmed this., 19219=1767\u20131798, 5455=HBMa 1229 *, 20317=1848\u20131872, 6702=Deaths (Z) 1874\u20131916, 4240=HBMa 1225, 23888=March 1844 to December 1847, 20174=1842\u20131848, 20985=1848 onwards, 6501=Deaths (Z) 1850\u20131873, 6875=*These two indexes, nos. HBMa 1229 (births) and 1233 (deaths), refer to birth and death registers (similar to but different from nos. 1223 and 1226, respectively) that have been lost. The page numbers given in these indexes do not therefore correspond to the page numbers in nos. 1223 and 1226. The indexes that do correspond exactly to registers 1223 and 1226 are indexes 1230 and 1234 respectively., 6259=HBMa 1233 *, 20028=1798\u2013mid 1842, 30674=In the possession of the Brno Jewish Community is the Graveyard Register prepared by the Nikolsburg Chevra Kadischa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the rule of Emperor Franz Josef I, in 1898.\u00a0 The register includes mostly family name, first name, grave number, sometimes an alternative name or a Hebrew religious name, and for deaths after 1880 ususally a date of death.\u00a0 It is unclear how the register was compiled - whether from existing documents or directly from the gravestone inscriptions or both., 22425=This is a smaller bound volume, with handwritten entries, of births in Nikolsburg from 1763 to 1847, with some gaps. It is the remnants of original birth records kept in the Jewish community. The entries are chronological, with full dates (including months and days) given. In general, the names given are those of the child, of the father and the mother. However, the order in which these three names are given varies throughout the book. The volume as it exists at present may have been put together from parts of separate books, or else from a single book that fell apart, with sections being reinserted, but not necessarily in the correct order. This is the sequence of pages. These four sections are not marked as such as separate sections, but follow on from one another without a break., 5768=HBMa 1223, 23600=January 1763 to April 1831, 21337=Images of the entire F-R are available online at http://collections.jewishmuseum.cz/index.php/Search/Index?search=Mikulov+Rejst\u0159\u00edk. The images are available on 11 webpages, each with a link indicated by a thumbnail image and a caption beginning \u017didovsk\u00e1 n\u00e1bo\u017eensk\u00e1 obec Mikulov, Rejst\u0159\u00edk (z roku 1913) k matrik\u00e1m, NOZ 1762 - 1912. The first page has images of the cover and introductory pages of the register. Next are three pages containing the listings of births (narozen\u00ed) divided into three alphabetical groupings, three pages of deaths (zem\u0159el\u00ed) and three pages of marriages (oddan\u00ed), divided similarly. The eleventh page contains a list of rabbis., 3900=Births (N) 1850\u20131873, 6655=HBMa 1235, 5898=Marriages (O) 1849\u20131873, 17387=The original vital data kept by the Jewish community in Nikolsburg went back much further than the copies now surviving in the National Archives. In an act of considerable foresight, Rabbi Moritz Levin decided in 1913 to compile a complete index of the birth, marriage and death registers up to that year. The index was further updated by others in 1919, with new information added up to that year. This massive tome, known as the \u201cFamilien-Register\u201d (F-R), and now rather worn with its spine coming off, has survived in the Nikolsburg collection of the Jewish Museum archives., 5301=Births (N) 1850\u20131873, 4028=Births (N) 1874\u20131916, 20844=1798\u20131848, 5650=HBMa 1230, 24341=January 1773 to July 1847, 3853=HBMa 1222, 12833=The first records in the Museum Archive's holdings were made available online in 2014, at the URL given above. As of this writing, images of one (very useful) register are available. All other records can only be viewed in person at the archives.

The numbers of the registers and indexes for Mikulov (and most Jewish vital records) all begin with the prefix HBMa: Inventory of registers What survives of the vital data for Nikolsburg is patchy. In the National Archives in Prague, the registers of vital data date from 1849, at the earliest, to 1916 at the latest. There is also a short register of births, deaths and marriages from between 1939 and 1949; this register only states that no such vital events were recorded for those years.

Accessing the Records Online Good quality digital images of the records held by the National Archive are available for viewing online. This is the most convenient way for most people to access these records. The website is in Czech, so English speakers may find the following instructions helpful. Go to http://www.badatelna.eu/fond/1073 Click on the word INVENT\u00c1\u0158 along the top. Click on the plus sign to the left of the words \u00da\u0158EDN\u00cd KNIHY (matriky a indexy). Now you see an alphabetized list of towns. Scroll down to MIKULOV. Click on the plus sign to the left of the town name. You will see a list of registers, which matches the inventory above. At the end of the list (before the next town) is the word indexy, with a plus sign to the left. If you click on that plus sign you will also see the index registers. To view a specific register, click on the word REPRODUKCE",
