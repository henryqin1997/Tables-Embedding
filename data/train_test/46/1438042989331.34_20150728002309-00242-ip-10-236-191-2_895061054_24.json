            "Security cars and people on foot are always around and I've never been afraid for my safety. North side of campus may be on the edge of a bad neighborhood, but many bad things don't happen as long as you do things the safe way.",
            "Greek life is very active here, and we're also known for being anti-hazing. Recruitment and Rush week are in the 2nd and 3rd weeks of Fall quarter, and every sorority and fraternity has their own social group and activities that they hold throughout the year.",
            "There are so many clubs that no one could ever be a part of them all. Even if there isn't a club that you want to join, you can make your own. There are over 300 clubs here!",
            "Research, goal-driven. People who already have a career goal in mind.",
            "Everyone rubs the water boy's toe in Main Building during midterms and finals week. The 4 D chant is also chanted at every sporting event.",
            "Drexel is mostly known for the co-op experience, and most colleges don't offer up to 18 months of professional experience by graduation. The price may be steep and continuously rising, but the opportunities for research and professional development is unbeatable.",
            "I'm not much of a party-goer, but I know that they exist. Clubs are abundant here, and there's always some kind of activity or social going on every day and every weekend. There's never a dull moment, and if you get tired of campus, you can hop on public transportation or on one of the Drexel shuttles to go downtown to center city to shop or go to the movies.",
            "The official campus dining hall, nicknamed The Hans, is not the best food in the world, but it will do in a pinch. Mostly freshman eat there because of the mandatory meal plan, but a lot of people just go to food trucks and cook at their apartments once they get to sophomore year and up. The food trucks are great, and Penn's campus has a lot of other food options that aren't available directly on campus.",
            "I personally don't dorm because of financial reasons, but many of my friends dorm and they love it. Most people get along with everyone on their floor and there are hardly ever any roommate issues. Laundry is free and there are many different dorming options to choose from, varying from a traditional dorm setting to a suite setting. Air conditioning is in most of the dorms.",
            "Depending on the class you take, it may be harder or easier than you expected it to be. Drexel allows you to test out of certain classes and get you to classes that are on par with your ability. Honestly, you can take the desperately easy classes for a GPA boost, but Drexel prides in their students taking at least 15 credit hours a quarter with a maximum of 20 credit hours per quarter. Professors are generally very knowledgeable and are accomplished in their fields. Coursework is typical as any research university but the quarter system makes things slightly harder.",
            "Have an idea of what you want to do in after you graduate college. Also start getting accustomed to working quickly and studying on your own because Drexel is on a quarter system so 10 weeks go by very quickly with midterms starting as early as week 4. Finally, be passionate about going to school and research into your potential major before making a decision.",
            "Drexel is a very career-focused school where most students already have an idea of what field they want to be in after graduation. Professors truly care about students and it is up to the students in what they make their college experience. Drexel is also a technology-driven school, so Wi-fi and computers are always available at all points of campus."

A group tour might be ok if you want to see the campus, but not if you want to try to get to know the campus. Plus, a student will be able to give you a more personal insight into their experiences. With all of that in mind, be aware that the way Drexel operates is in terms or a quarter system. The average college has two semesters of around 14 or 16 weeks and a summer break. Drexel's freshman year consists of three 10 week terms equal to that of a semester and summer term off. The credits you earn on the quarter system are sometimes looked as unequal to those on a semester system by other colleges, so if you ever want to transfer it might be very difficult to do. The workload is very intense being 10 weeks as opposed to 16. Also, Drexel starts and ends later than most colleges. Drexel begins Fall term near the end of September, and Spring term ends around the second week of June, much like most high schools. Good luck on your searching!, 2340=Right now, I am on summer vacation. I cannot wait to go back to Drexel in September. Drexel's campus is filled with fun clubs, organizations, and there's always something to do. If you tire of being on campus, the heart and soul of Philadelphia, Center City, is a short, (free) shuttle ride away., 136741=File FAFSA in January, and you will automatically get $1000 in aid from Drexel., 591407=The top floor of our main buildings has this one room that surely hasn't been touched since 1980. There's all this old tech stuff forgotten up there, which is cool to see. I always want to explore that floor more, I have a feeling there's alot more history to be found., 379117=Not so much on campus but Philadelphia has the Mummer's parade every New Year's and has a great Welcome America for fourth of July., 821129=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 747539=If you're up for the challenge, the opportunities are here at Drexel. If your interested in research, check out the STAR program for incoming freshmen. It's a paid summer internship with housing. For anyone considering attending Drexel, I would contact the department you would be considering for your major. I set up an appointment with the Electrical Engineering department when I went on the campus tour. I met with a professor and an adviser, they were great. They explained how the program worked, spoke about Drexel in general and answered all the questions my parents and I had . They gave us contact information that we used later for followup questions via email and telephone. Checkout the COOP program,COOP is what makes Drexel different. Freshman year started in 9/2012, all freshman are required to take classes to prepare for COOP. In 12/2013 I interviewed with 4 companies, got job offers from 3 and just started(3/31/14) a 6 month full-time position with SAP Solutions (the 4th largest software company in the world). It's an unbelievable opportunity. Even more unbelievable is that I get paid (I think alot), they offered me benefits, health insurance, 401K. I'm excited to learn and contribute. The other tip is something I heard from student at every school I looked at. GET INVOLVED and do it right away... club, sports, Greek life, work study job, student government, newspaper, pep band, anything.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot I have just finished my first year at Drexel and I already feel like I am learning a lot. The classes are challenging, but the professors are extremely helpful. For example, I took AP Calculus at my high school and did okay, but I didn't feel I was learning much. I was confused and stressed. At Drexel, I took a math class which covered everything I had done in my AP Calculus class already, but this time around I felt so much more confident.
