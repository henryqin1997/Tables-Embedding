            "The campus is safe. I have never had any scary incident. The campus police are always ready to walk students to their cars any time of the day for any reason. They also offer life skills to students such as training to protect oneself, how to react in emergency situations, and many others. Students should look into those programs.",

            "I have not encountered any unusual traditions at the college. I am pretty familiar with every location on campus. It is a small campus that has some charm.",
            "When I first joined, i though it was a bang for the buck but, tuition cost has increase and it seem to be getting higher and higher. Take all the cheaper classes at community college and for those that it doesn't offer, take at the university if you're on a budget.",
            "Join the honor society. Engage in student government. Some times the college host student social activities. Students can also attend meetings that discuss the future of tuition cost.",

            "Education is intense. It involves a higher level of understanding. Some of the courses are tough but, the professors make it very clear what they expect from you during the course. IF a student follows the professors guidance they'll pass. Schedule your classes ahead of time or else you'll regret it.",

Several web based classes online which is great for adult/non-traditional students. Cost of tuition per semester is very reasonable - four classes $1200., 329372=At only 1000 dollars a semester for a full load of classes plus books, this is the best deal out there. Some of our teachers even teach at the nearby university as well so you are getting the same education at a much lower rate., 366487=When I started college back in 2002, I think it was $150 for a 3 credit class. Now it is only 253.5 for a 3 credit class, which isn't bad compared to UNR., 216838=Read everything and call several times to verify that you have the correct information. On average you need to call three times to receive accurate information. If someone dies in your immediate family and you ask for a week breavement, please be aware that it is up to the teacher to excuse you, my sister died in a car accident in the middle of the 2011 Fall semester. Only one teacher let me make up the week of work I missed due to funeral services and dealing with her death. If you have received bad information, let someone know, write a letter, as often you will find the students working in the financial aid office are not informed and give out the wrong information.}",
