            "VERY safe campus, little to no criminal activity Campus security is always around There are Emergency alert buttons all around campus just in case, but there really is never need for them!",
            "Sororities - Yes Fraternity - One (Not surprising because there are very few male students when compared to the female population) Not a big thing",
            "1) All sorts of academic/major related clubs 2) Gay Straight Alliance 3) International Club",
            "Every Christmas, there is a lighting of a Christmas tree in the Liberal Arts Center",
            "Marywood is a great school and I love it here! Even though we are religious affiliated university, we are very open-minded and accept all that are different/unique",
            "1) There's not much to do around campus but there is a bus system (The COLT system) that is free for students, that will take you downtown, Scranton University, etc. 2) We are a dry campus, but if you are keen to partying...Scranton University is only a few minutes away",
            "1) Food is alright, not first class cuisine or whatever 2) A couple of choices, not many but a few 3) Vegan/vegetarian options are small, but I'm sure if you request beforehand there will be available options",
            "1) All dorms/houses have pretty nice rooms/bathrooms 2) Regina hall is the only dorm with community bathrooms, the others are mainly 4 residents to a bathroom 3) Great community: in most cases, everyone seems to get along with those who live around them. If not, people are still polite enough to say 'hello' and open doors for each other. You don't need to be best friends with your roommate or hall-mates, but you should always be civil at the least.",
            "- Everybody works hard academically and the professors are always there to help - Academics is definitely a huge focus for the majority of Marywood students",
            "1) Get involved in clubs and organizations around campus because it is a great way to get involved and meet new people 2) Themed living is a great opportunity to live together with your friends and help serve your community",
            "Marywood University is a small, catholic university that provides for everyone and tries to accommodate to each and every student. The community is close-knit and everybody is so nice. All professors want the best for their students and provide all the assistance they can."

There is downtown Scranton, Nay Aug park, and the top of the world, a hike with the best hidden secret that Scranton has to offer. A must do!, 148274=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 70882=The amount of squirrels on campus kind of makes you think there is a squirrel to student ratio of 20:1., 40564=As an art major, I was highly impressed by how amazing the art program was. My classes are jam packed with three hour art classes, and though that might seem a bit long, I enjoy every single minute I spend doing what I love. I enjoyed that I was instantly able to jump into my major while still having other core classes such as Modern Belief and History Since 1865 to keep me sane when the concentration on art was so heavy., 4626=Applying Advice: Apply early as possible. There are certain scholarships that have a deadline. Scholarships Advice: Keep up GPA, work hard on SATs (they do matter), volunteer alot, and take APs/honors if possible. ------As of this year Marywood has a scholarship called Marywood Scholars its $20,000 a year ($80,000 overall). To get this you need a GPA of 3.5 in high school and 1200 or higher in SATs. SATs/ACTs: Sudy for SATs- instead of cramming just do one or two problems a day. Take advantage of any prep classes/tutors. ACTs- Take the ACTs if you can. They cannot hurt you. Many people do better on them than the SATs. Plus, it will look good if you have both. Though, it is not necessary., 128916=There is one sorority on campus, Zeta Phi Delta. They are a sorority devoted to service. There is also a fraternity, Mu Sigma Pi. This fraternity is new, started only in 2012. They are a brotherhood dedicated to helping those in the community., 77496=My college is Marywood University in Scranton, Pennsylvania. I love that it is close to home so I can stay close with my family. My father passed away july 20th, 2012 so I need to stay close for my mother.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here The community here is very small and close-knit. whenever you walk you will see at least one person you know on the way to class. Everyone is very nice and are more than happy to help. Plus, everyone say hello to you on campus, whether they know you are not. Am learning a lot Marywood University is very unique in the fact they offer a wide variety of classes. From art, fien arts, math, history, foreign languages, sciences, etc...Marywood has it. Also, Marywood is a liberal arts college which means the University prides itself in producing well-rounded students. This will better help these students at life by helping them find a job in the current economy.
