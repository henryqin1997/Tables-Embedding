Conditional (or ternary) Operators Assignment Operators Logical (or Relational) Operators Comparision Operators Arithmetic Operators What is Operator? Simple answer can be given using expression 4 + 5 is equal to 9. Here 4 and 5 are called operands and + is called operator. PHP language supports following type of operators.
