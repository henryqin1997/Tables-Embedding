            "Live on campus if you can. Use the library and other resources to your advantage. Do not slack on your FOCUS assignments. Keep track of your chapel attendances.",
            "Although pricey, it is well worth your money. Unlike other universities in California, at CBU you are guaranteed to find classes for you major and you do not have to worry about your major being impacted. Also, at CBU you will be addressed by your name and not a number.",
            "I love the campus. I love it so much I am trying to see if I can live on campus next year. Everybody is so friendly and the campus is beautiful and it is also very clean. Being on campus, you will feel welcomed and you can feel the amount of faith that surrounds you.",
            "The class rooms are small enough to get one-on-one time with the professor. All the professors have a strong grasp on the subject they are teaching and teach with a passion."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{129352=the classes here are great. they the teacher to student ratio is about 1:21 but it is actually a lot smaller if i might add. i had one class with only 6 students! and trust me that is awesome. it might depend on the major you are also, but so far i have had only one class that was somewhat large and that was a general education class that is popular on campus, it is called marine science., 198016=Best college cafeteria food ever. Sunday brunch is to die for. People actually come from off campus to eat in out cafeteria. There is also a restaurant called Briscios that offers sandwiches, and salads. There is a new restaurant opening fall 2012 that is going to offer different types of pasta. All of these are options that use the meal plan., 94607=The facilities, classes, professors, food, student body, and the school itself are all fantastic. There are buildings that are still standing from when the school was founded in 1954, but they are all standing strong, and are diligently maintained. In addition to buildings that were there originally, California Baptist University has purchased much of the land around it, and continues making renovations on existing buildings, as well as recently built facilities, and buildings that are being constructed., 463048=On campus, one can visit the game room and play ping pong, pool, shuffleboard, or Foosball. There is also a recreational center being built which will have workout equipment, a pool, an above ground track, a rock climbing wall, and much more. This is projected to open in the spring of 2013., 39258=Woo fest, March Madness and the Man Auction are all great traditions and so much fun to participate in!, 246543=The CBU crazies march during homecoming, there are several cool spots too! For example, there is the fortuna fountain, the catacombs( unfortunately you cannot go down in them) and the front lawn in general is nice., 658978=There are many events on campus for the residence and commuter students. If any events are coming up there will be posters around campus, people will tell you during Chapel, your RA will post things in the living area and you can check lancermail to see what is going on. There are service events to help out the community and hang out with friends. During September we have TWIRP week were the girl ask the boys on dates the entire week. Also have midnight madness, christmas chapel and etc. Next semester we have WOO! same as TWIRP but instead the boys ask the girls and woo there affection. Just a munch of events to connects everybody together and meet new people., 25803=There are tons of fun things to do on campus at any given moment. I enjoy spending my free time playing Futsol(street soccer) with friends or having late night jam sessions with my band, or even just kicking back and watching a movie at amc with a 7$ ticket bought from campus life. Oh and did i mention that the mountians and beach are only 45 min away? Wooo! 4:1 ratio!, 322308=A very friendly environment. The staff as been awesome in helping me along the way for the 2012-2013 school year. I'm so excited for what the future has for me at cbu., 533345=Despite it's hefty price tag, I've only have had to pay 1200 out of my own pocket. I feel like I'm paying for Cal State tuition. :) Which is a plus. However, make sure you're able to pay for 2/3 of the tuition. If you end up having to pay for more than $10,000 through your own pocket, and loans, do not attend Cal Baptist. You'd be better attending another college or university. Also, only take out Federal Subsidized loans (and not even a single unsubsidized loan). Private loans will haunt you if you take them out. Believe the horror stories you read about those taking out private loans., 255431=They do TONS of free and fun stuff. On November 1st to kick off Homecoming they were able to get Switchfoot to come and gave out like 600 FREE TICKETS!!! AND!! The concert was in our very own gym! And for midnight madness instead of just regular tickets they gave out CBU watches., 23013=No frats sorry, but tons of great clubs! Baking club for example............4:1 ratio!, 734003=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Reviewer has been to campus. 17 out of 18 people found this review useful. 2 of 166 Categories Comments Tips for prospective students It's a great deal of work to attend a private university like CBU, but I guarantee that it is worth every dollar! Don't let the cost daunt you! If you're committed to going there and you trust in God's plan, anything can happen! Just remember-- always make sure you know when your deadlines are!
