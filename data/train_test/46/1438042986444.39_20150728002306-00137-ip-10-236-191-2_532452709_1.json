            "Jul. 25, 2015 This game would be the best TD on Kong if it was optimized... like, at all. Given that you need quick reactions with your active abilities and need to manage a fair bit of swapping out to get/make use of the upgrades you earn throughout a stage, the input lag (it's been as bad as ten seconds after 25 odd waves on stage 19) is CRIPPLING. Please, tidy the code up, update the game, something... I really like the design and gameplay but I can only play to a certain point due to the poor optimization. \u200b",
            "May. 22, 2015 I think there might be lesbians in this game. Maybe. \u200b",
            "May. 14, 2015 Don't worry about the 'one guy studio' thing. Look at Kupo, the Epic Battle Fantasy guy. In my opinion his games are more visually appealing, but simpler in tone and mechanics. You could do a lot with the combat and harvesting system if Flash wasn't constraining you. Don't limit yourself... it's clear in the writing and concept you can do much more. Try Unity or something, there are lots of free programs out there with plenty of online tutorials. Sure, you could stand out at this level, or you could go further (it's clear you want to), invest more, learn from it, and stand out in a higher field as well. \u200b",
            "May. 13, 2015 Cute game. But what kind of boss dies in one hit? Is this Titan Souls? \u200b",
            "Apr. 19, 2015 Gotta love it when your opponent doesn't want to win, just get a huge economy and curse you forever. Cool game otherwise. \u200b",
            "Mar. 14, 2015 Considering you can win without moving the mouse at all when fully upgraded, I wouldn't worry that much about doing so. \u200b",
            "Feb. 19, 2015 Would've liked to see more of this idle, but the save isn't working properly. Guess I'll have to clipboard the export link for now...

            "Feb. 07, 2015 Think I found something better than the ninja squad everyone's talking about up there: two robots, a witch, and a cat. Leveling special and candy early gives you a bunch of extra candy for faster levelling, and the frenzy/brew combo lets you keep speed and attack fairly low early on to allow for it. Late game it gets pretty crazy, with your special up most of the time melting 3-4 waves of enemies per use. Hitting guys behind you isn't a problem with the speed boost from brew; you can just loop around them. Never got below half HP, ended with nearly 7k extra candy and over 15k score. \u200b",
            "Sep. 22, 2014 When going for gauntlet try to keep 2 or 3 of the original guys alive; they aren't overcharged, so they're good to have around filling a spot doing less damage than the new guys. \u200b",
            "Sep. 22, 2014 Uhhh... Earth has around 7 billion population, not 96 million. That's just people, too. \u200b",
            "Sep. 20, 2014 I've lost count of how many times letting go of x lagged and led to stupid jumps.... fun otherwise though. \u200b",
            "Feb. 11, 2014 all of my why \u200b",
            "Dec. 18, 2013 Don't mind me folks, just walking my disembodied eye\u2026 don't even need to tie this one up! Excellent game, wonderful atmosphere, stimulating philosophy. \u200b",
            "Dec. 11, 2013 This plays like an idle game in the later levels thanks to lag. \u200b",
            "Nov. 20, 2013 Pretty good take on Knightmare Tower. As it's been said though, having a time based combo system is no good. Keeping in the air or not getting hit make more sense in this format. \u200b",
            "Nov. 02, 2013 I really want to like this game as it shows a lot of promise. Later levels get really laggy though, becoming a problem for me about halfway through the red forest. You might want to add some explanation about how items work and what a strong enemy is, those prompts that flash across the screen the first time you see them aren't enough. \u200b",
            "Oct. 15, 2013 Love this series, but the lag makes this the worst of them. It might be a data leak, since it seems alright at first no matter which level I start on. I've yet to have a boss fight go the way I want with all the stuff they spawn... easily had enough mana to fear them off, but it didn't register fast enough. \u200b",
            "Sep. 15, 2013 It's been a long time since I've felt so satisfied after completing a game. It really made me think. I appreciate the writing and music especially... thank you very much for this enlightening experience. \u200b",
            "Aug. 08, 2013 That's a cocktail redbeard, everyone knows werewolves only sew in chrinos form. \u200b",
            "Aug. 07, 2013 Dear FunFlow: That's not how Match 3 combos work. \u200b"
