Also, because of BCC's close vicinity to the University of California Berkeley (UCB), there are often UCB professors that teach part-time at BCC. I have noticed that my professors at BCC are consistently very knowledgeable and passionate about the areas of study that they are representing in their classes. Unfortunately, because of budget cuts, under-staffing and overcrowding, I have felt at times that the curriculum has been rushed or watered down a bit.
