            "UWM is a very safe campus. There are many ways to secure your safety like B.O.S.S travel buses that take you throughout campus after dark and safe walkers that walk with you if you don't have a group. There are also safety buttons and numbers you can call if you are ever in danger on campus.",
            "there are many different clubs and activities but often you have to be willing to be very involved because often new students are over looked and don't always feel welcome. be patient and with time you will be a part f the group.",
            "I would say this campus in more for students who are independent and do not have a hard time meeting new people/are out going.",
            "overall tuition and everything that is included is reasonable and affordable!",
            "in Milwaukee there is a ton to do for fun. often museums have student discounts certain days of the week and the campus offers free bus transportation with your tuition fee which makes going out easier. Campus is also not far from the beach and when the weather is nice you can play volley ball or catch some rays.",
            "overall the food is pretty good, has many options for students and is affordable. the dining hours are very convenient and the food overall tastes good",
            "though the dorms have decent food, very convenient in location, and accommodate to students needs, at times it is still difficult to meet new people even while living on campus. From past experience, dorm life was hard for me to adapt to and after first semester i found it best to live at home because i didn't meet as many people or make new friends like i intended.",
            "the academic work load is often easier when hard work is put into it. The difficulty and intensity is based on how much effort the student puts into studying.",
            "Make sure you get involved in many activities, it makes it easier to meet new people, which is sometimes hard in such a diverse campus.",
            "UW- Milwaukee is a very diverse campus with many opportunists. The professors are top notch and are all very approachable and there for you. Class sizes are never to large and the campus is easy to navigate through."

Oriental Theater, Miramar Theater for good music and movies., 229674=Looking for fun things to do in Milwaukee is hardly ever an issue. The Miramar on Oakland ave is a great venue for bands and electronic music Wednesday - Saturday of most every week (the only downside about the venue being a small cover charge). For those who are 21 or older, there are many bars and clubs surrounding the area to have fun, dance, and meet new and interesting people. During the warmer months bike riding, rollerblading, running, or playing volleyball is quite popular around the beaches on Lincoln Memorial Drive., 20213=Apply for as many scholarships as possible for school. Whether it is $100, or $1000, every little bit helps. Also, be sure to get your information and everything sent in by the deadlines so that you are not feeling like you are behind everyone else., 40126=I would suggest that anyone looking to pursue a dance degree should take dance classes from a local studio for a few years before attending the required audition. It was very obvious that the professors conducting the audition were looking for prospective students with previous dance training. Scholarships were awarded at the first three auditions held in October, February, and April. The last audition was held in June and students were still admitted to the program but scholarship money had already been used up., 761151=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 348388=Every October there is a Zombie Apocalypse where there are students dressed up as zombies, and you must cross the campus without being bitten., 163393=We have so many clubs and activities that I wouldn't even be able to count! If you can think of something we most likely have it! I, on the other hand, found an organization that we did not have, Autism Speaks. Once I found out we did not have an organization here, I started looking into starting it. I am now currently getting the chapter started for the Fall 2012 semester!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck I am only paying the tuition rate, which is somewhere around $8,000. When you pay your student fee, which I think is $200, you get a UPASS. This allows Milwaukee students to ride the buses for free anywhere in Milwaukee, even during Summerfest. We also get free concerts at the end of the week (Pantherfest) which is pretty cool. Am enjoying being here I am a commuter student, which kind of sucks. It's not so much that I don't live on campus, but more of the fact that I get stuck in the rush hours. However, I was really nervous about commuting because I didn't think I was going to meet anyone or make friends, but I was wrong. You have a lot of opportunities to meet people, all you have to do is talk to them. There is almost always something going on on-campus. There are a TON of student organizations you can join, which I highly recommend. I personally really enjoy the campus because it's so different than my high school. There are so many different people here to meet and it's not cliquish at all. Am learning a lot I am currently enrolled in the College of L&S, so all my classes are breadth",
