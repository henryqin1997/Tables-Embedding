            "MSAC itself has very little to do for fun. It is really up to you, the student, to seek out others and network yourself. There are many clubs open at SAC and I highly suggest you join at least one to extend your community college experience. Walnut is a relatively tame town. It lacks clubs, bars, and an active night life. There is, however, a highly populated 24 hour fitness near the Village. What Walnut lacks in fun it makes up in academic prestige, good study environment, and small town atmosphere. There are lots more things to do towards the West as you near Los Angeles. Rowland Heights has a lot more places catered to young people as well as Asian foods.",
            "Food and dining near MSAC is quite good. There are many fast-food restaurants catered to young people. These include: In n Out, Starbucks, Ten Ren's (an Asian favorite), Chipotle, and Chik Fil A. More Asian flavor diversity can be found by traveling west towards Los Angeles around the city of Rowland Heights. There are lots of scrumptious Asian restaurants that include food such as sushi, dim sum, hot pot, and korean BBQ.",
            "There are no dorms available, but here is what I know of housing experience around MSAC. I lived at home, but here is what I learned from living around the area and word of mouth. Walnut is a beautiful, small suburban town. If you can land a room here, prepare to pay up as rates increase due to multiple factors including: proximity to good schools, property values are high, and you're living among middle-class to high middle-class residents. Pomona is a lot cheaper to live in. However, prepare for lower quality management. This includes cockroaches in the apartments across MSAC due to the incompetent nature of their management. There are lots of restaurants and cafe-oriented places around SAC, especially at the Village down Grand Ave. If you live far, I suggest bringing study materials and a laptop and coming here.",
            "MSAC has a varying degree of academic rigor, depending on your major, professors, and work ethic. For one, MSAC's physics department is notorious for its difficulty. Most students who care about their GPAs avoid taking physics if possible. However, the physics department is rigorous for a reason as MSAC's physics/engineering club often score highly in their robotics contests. My own subject, Computer Science, has a relatively limited offering at MSAC. Courses are extremely limited and sections are often cut due to budget limitations. I highly recommend Professor Vo, if you can land a course with him. Many of the programming professors are either unqualified for teaching their respective subjects or do not teach the course you need to transfer out. Prepare to bring your own laptop if you are attempting to add. Do not give up, do not surrender. Grab those classes like it's your lifeblood.",
            "I highly recommend taking public transportation or bicycling to school as parking here is horrendous. Examples of my experiences with Mt. SAC's well-thought out parking lot design include: being cited for parking illegally with hundreds of other students parking on red-marked sidewalks. Another instance included the time when my car was towed as I had parked across at the shopping plaza to avoid missing my exam. In total, Mt. SAC's debacle of a parking lot coupled with the countless swarms of students resulted in about $500. I consider myself lucky as I live in the city of Walnut, 10 minutes from the school. Consider alternative transportation if you do decide to attend. Classes and registration are among the most limited of resources in MSAC. Use whatever means and grab any opportunity to achieve priority registration. I highly regret not applying to Student Government for the registration benefits. As per most non-university student governments, most officers need not be fully competent nor experienced with leadership. Simply putting yourself out there and being social will net a far better experience at community college than my own work-hard, try and get out experience. Professors are hit or miss at MSAC. Take www.ratemyprofessors.com with a grain of salt. I have had difficult professors be some of my most passionate mentors in their subjects and the easiest class ever professors simply reciting off the textbooks. Be prepared to drop and/or add any of your required classes. Most importantly, start on your MAJOR pre-requisite courses IMMEDIATELY. Do not procrastinate and try to find the best professors in your respective field of study. Your competence and knowledge in the subject are strongly determined by the efficacy and rigor of your mentors.",
            "Prepare to fight your hardest for classes, parking, and registration priority. Mt. SAC was a bittersweet experience reminiscent of most community colleges nowadays. It is up to you, the student, to find the hidden opportunities and educational prospects present at SAC."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{121223=Mount SAC is a very gorgeous campus. I was very surprised when I first came to visit in the summer of 2011. I would give this school a 4/5 in rating., 2626=At Mt. SAC, students truly are aware of the schools mission and that is academic success. We are reputable for being one of the top schools with successful transfer students and graduates. Furthermore, we have one of the most diverse campuses throughout southern California, and, we have one of the best athletic programs in the state. Having such a diverse student body has made the campus ever so exciting. This is because our student body has so many eclectic and active clubs on campus, numerous sports, and so many intelligent and talented students. I myself was part of the political science club called Global Resistance Networks. Considering how large the campus is and how many students attend here, the community still managed to feel like a family. I got to know the student body government, presidents from the different clubs, and the peers who were in my classes that were interested in what I found to be exciting. Furthermore, I got to mingle with football, basketball, and soccer players who were athletes going on a full ride to some of the best universities in the country! During the Budget Cuts on community colleges, we all got together to create a March and Rally against the Budget Cuts against California's Community Colleges. Apart from activism, many events occur here. If its our radio show holding events or colleges visiting our campuses, there is always something going on. We have plenty of nature at our campus. You may either find students napping under a tree or relaxing on the grass eating, studying, or talking to their friends. At Mt. SAC, no doubt you will find that it is a pleasant school to attend., 133159=Sometimes people get mugged in the parking lots/campus at night an incident recently occurred this fall 2012 semester. On top of that someone attempted suicide in the English building area., 500486=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 92374=Sports is a big thing at Mt Sac and one tradition that has been held every year since 1948 is the Mt Sac invite for cross county running and the world famous Mt Sac relays in the spring for track and field athletes. Some of the worlds most famous track athletes have competed at mt sac and it is a tradition celebrated every year., 145513=One should be patient. Transitioning from high school or work can be difficult. The primary struggle one encounters as a starter is attaining classes. Choose early morning classes (7:30 a.m.) or night classes (7:00 p.m.). Also, target the classes less in demand, such as dancing, art, culinary, some foreign languages, and physical education. Although these courses may not directly assist one in acquiring his or her degree, it will get one an earlier registration date that can be used to enroll in important classes such as English and math. I commenced with French and theater. They were not very useful for my major but aided me in getting a good registration date.}",
