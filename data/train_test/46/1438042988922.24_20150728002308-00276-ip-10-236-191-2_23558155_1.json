    "textBeforeTable": "But Bill James brings up a better point. Who are the great two-seam fastball ground ball pitchers out there? Clearly Brandon Webb has to be the most famous example. But let's consider the others. I only had reliable two-seamed fastball data for 2009, so all examples have to be from last year. Here are the most name-recognizable pitchers who classified as \"type 8: two-seam fastball pitcher\" by my scheme. All data courtesy of PF/X posted on FanGraphs. I created a new category of pitchers, centered around those that throw a high percentage of two-seam fastballs. Indeed, this category of pitchers had very high ground ball rates (something like 6% higher than average), but also lower strikeout rates (about 0.5 K/9 less than average). I was going to write an article about whether or not this \"tradeoff\" is worth it. When I left off my baseball research, I left off with a classification of pitchers by the type of pitches that they throw. Dave Allen pointed out that I should look at pitchers who throw two-seam fastballs, as those pitchers have become the subject of much sabermetric discussion. Two-seam fastballs induce ground balls like no other pitch, and the value of ground balls for pitchers has become a hotly debated topic. (By hot, I mean that multiple analysts are competing to show how much value ground balls really have for pitchers.) I've said it a thousand times, but.",
    "textAfterTable": "Fausto Carmona 9% 33% Chien-Ming Wang 23% NA Carlos Silva 43% 50% Ignoring Scott Kazmir, who no longer throws two-seam fastballs, and the hobbled CM Wang, is there anything we can generalize about the two-seam fastball pitchers? First of all, none of them are backing off the pitch. This is selective, since I chose the most recognizable proponents of the pitch, and PF/X pitch classifications are not consistent year to year. Still, I think this suggests that two-seam fastball pitchers are on the rise. How is it affecting their stats? All of these pitchers are recording high GB% stats on the season, except for Brian Matusz. Joel Pineiro leads with 56%, and none of these guys except Matusz are below 45% (league average is in the low 40% range). Accounting for randomness, these pitchers are all getting high ground ball rates, in part due to their use of the two-seam fastball. However none of them except for Liriano are having top-level season. Here are the 2010 strikeout rates (K/9) for those pitchers: Pitcher 2010 K/9 Joel Piniero 5.7 Brian Matusz 6.9 Rick Porcello 4.5 Francisco Liriano 9.8 Fausto Carmona 4.8 Carlos Silva 6.3 Not surprisingly, Francisco Liriano has a 3.45 ERA, despite a very unlucky 0.350",
