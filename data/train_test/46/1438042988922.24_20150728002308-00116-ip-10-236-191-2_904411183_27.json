            "Tons of clubs and events going on in downtown Columbia every week. Programs by Stephens organizations occur a few times a month as well.",
            "Great variety of food. Some days are better than other but dining is all you can eat and there are so many options you are sure to find something to eat every time.",
            "The buildings are older and could use a lot of remodeling. Reconstruction has been ongoing for the past 2 years but still need a lot of work. However, the residents are great and a lot of fun, sure to make a lot of great connections just from Res Hall neighbors.",
            "Courses are challenging and demanding but faculty goes out their way to ensure you achieve good grades.",
            "Come in with an open mind. Stephens has a lot to offer and could really use people who are willing to contribute to the community.",
            "Stephens earns an excellent rating. I have never heard of an institution more dedicated than Stephens faculty. It's like being a part of a close-knit family."

This is really good because it is preparing me for when I graduate. It is giving me the upper hand because, unlike most college graduates, I will have already had real life experience in my field. Also, last October the interior design department got to go to Joplin, Missouri and help with the Extreme Makeover: Home Edition project there. Stephens is really good about giving their students stuff to put on their resumes., 91892=You can call the Security number at 3:28 am and say you need an escort across our tiny campus, and they will either walk with you or pick you up in a van and bring you to your room. Locked out of your dorm? Give them three minutes. Lost downtown? Give them ten. They are some of the hardest working and most compassionate people on campus--and they'll let you in to just about any building on campus at any hour of the night if needed., 105080=Overall Stephens College is great. Last October we got to volunteer for Extreme Makeover: Home Edition in Joplin. Who knows where Stephens will take us next., 169694=Midnight Breakfast. One night during finals, the faculty and professors all dress up in a certain theme and host a breakfast for all the students at 10:00 at night! It's a great way to unwind and de-stress during finals week., 193403=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 84489=1. There are an abundance of ghost stories around here, if you're into that sort of thing. Several buildings are said to be haunted and many of the girls here will confirm that they've seen some pretty strange stuff go down. 2. Our dean wears only red shoes, and her reasons are quite hilarious. 3. The most prominent tradition however, dates back to 1921. Stephens has a list of Ten Ideals to which the students are supposed to adhere; respect, courage, independence, support, sensitivity, responsibility, belief, creativity, intelligence, and leadership. Originally it was the mission statement of the school to educate young women and help them realize these ideals within themselves. Today that tradition is going strong with the selection of The Ten. Every year ten girls are selected secretly by the staff and administration and rewarded for embodying one of these ideals. It is quite an honor to be selected as one of The Ten.}",

Bang for the buck I am not sure about how much bang I am getting for my buck, but I sure am busy and challenged. What to do for fun There are many different things to do in Columbia Missouri for fun. There are also basketball games to watch. Food and Dining The flex plan needs to be reviewed and changed a bit, but other than that the food is pretty good. I have had a few not so good meals there, but all in all, its good. In three sentences When I started at Stephen's College, I was trying to choose between them and another school. I chose Stephen's and I have not been disappointed",
