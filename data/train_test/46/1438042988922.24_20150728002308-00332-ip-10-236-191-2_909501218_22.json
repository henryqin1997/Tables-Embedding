            "The safest campus I've ever seen. Always cops patrolling 24/7 making sure the students are safe.",
            "There is none...",
            "Organizations and clubs help keep the campus up-beat and having a great time.",
            "Small-town, relaxed, happy, fun, students who enjoy fun.",
            "There are many statues on campus and it is a tradition that has recently started but unknown people will decorate the statues on holidays, mid-terms, finals, etc. just for fun. People occasionally go to the fountain, which is gorgeous, and walk around the trails near campus.",
            "There are always intramural leagues going on around campus in various sports and activities. For bad weather days there is the game room or the Mid-BCC. The various organizations on campus host all kinds of fun things like paint parties, food parties, and fun things to do. The lake is always a hot spot for college students here in the summer and The Falls and the moonbow are common places and attractions for students.",
            "The food is good, could always use some improvements but overall its great.",
            "The dorms are clean, nice, easy to navigate around and the rooms are nice with nice furniture. The dorms are great even with the rules about open house and visit hours with the opposite sex.",
            "The classes are tough and the work is challenging but the teachers are great and they are always open for help and guidance whenever it is needed. The school does a great job of making sure you learn and can apply the information and offers tutoring at the ARC for anything you might be struggling with!",
            "You will love this small-town college life. It has a lot of school spirit and so many fun people and things to do around and about. Rain gear is a must on campus for the frequent rainy days and bikes are nice to have to get around easily on warm days.",
            "The University of the Cumberlands is a great place to for the start of the next chapter in someone's life. The professors are excellent, the students are amazing, the campus is beautiful, and our athletics are reaching standards never before seen in school history. This small, private college is a second home to anyone and everyone."

    "textAfterTable": "the academics can be challenging sometimes, but other times you may find it to be almost too easy. in some of my classes (general education courses) i was not challenged at all. however, this is not the case for all courses. some will take a lot of work to get an a or b, luckily the school does have tutors to help you out and professors are more than willing to further explain lectures during their office hours. Tips for prospective students there are a few tips you will want to know before coming here. the university as a whole is pretty conservative when it comes to almost everything; that includes politics, religion, etc. don't be surprised if your teacher is referencing god or the bible in any of your classes because it happens semi-frequently (depending on the teacher of course). In three sentences overall, i do enjoy being here at the university of the cumberlands and do not regret coming here one bit. the atmosphere is great; specifically the people you come in contact with on a daily basis including other students, staff and the professors. i'm very happy with the choice i made to come here and i think i will have a fabulous next four years furthering my education.
