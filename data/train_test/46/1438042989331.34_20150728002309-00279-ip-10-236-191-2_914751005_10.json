            "We've got a College of Arts and Sciences and Schools of Engineering, Nursing, and Business -- there's a place for practically every student here.",
            "Visit campus. Attend a few classes and consider spending the night. You need to know that it is a good fit for you.",
            "Perhaps one of the downsides to UP is its cost; it is a VERY expensive school. However, it is a wonderful institution of higher learning and very much worth it",
            "People are friendly, and there are all sorts of on campus activities that you can hang out at with your new friends. Every Saturday the RAs put on Pilots After Dark events. Past activities have included foam parties, art nights, and dances. The dorms do events, too; this past year mine had an international food night and a speed friending event, among other things. CBP organizes dances and coffehouses (last semester we had Meg and Dia!). CBP is also responsible for Espresso UP, which is a weekly hangout with free coffee, tea, and Italian sodas. All that is just the on campus stuff. Once you venture out into the city of Portland, there are tons of things to do. I won't list them all here, but highlights include Powell's Books, Voodoo Doughnuts, and Saturday Market.",
            "The academics at UP are excellent. Classes challenge you and make you think critically without being completely overwhelming. Small class sizes are also a plus. One of my classes last semester only had about ten students -- creates a nice atmosphere for discussion. There are also opportunities to learn outside of the classroom. I'm an English major and have an on campus job writing for our newspaper. The English Dept. also sponsors NUCL, a conference where students have the opportunity to present their original papers. Ed majors spend time in local elementary and high schools as a part of their field experience. Some students have internships. If you look around, you will definitely be able to find something to supplement the experience you're getting in the classroom."

Enjoy your college experience but don't forget to study. Tips for prospective students Get a map of Portland and a copy of the bus schedule which can be found on trimet.org. This could save you a lot of time and money. Don't bring all of your clothes because you will never find the time to wash them. Don't sign up for Mehling hall unless you like living with 800 girls. Do explore the campus and meet your professors during office hours. Come prepared with questions. Save your money. Don't go to the mall unless you work there. Don't go to the movies on weekends-the school hosts free movies on weekends for our enjoyment. Do buy a really good mattress pad. Bring towels for the shower and a transportable shower caddy. I find body wash is better than soap",
