With the Raiders suffering their first loss of the competition in last week's round, they will be out to show their home crowd that it won't happen again and unfortunately for the Wellington side I feel they will be getting a thrashing. Hibiscus Coast Raiders vs. Wellington 12 July 2003, Stanmore Bay. Kick off at 2.30pm., 18350=THE Olympic Sharks are set to abandon Shark Park for the 2003/2004 NSL season and have made an ambitious bid to relocate to Jubilee Oval. It is understood that the perennial nomads of the NSL competition have made a formal application to the St.George Leagues Club for the use of the venue. While a decision on the application is imminent, the appropriateness of having Olympic based at Kogarah needs to be investigated. In recent times Olympic have played at a variety of grounds such as Barton Park, Leichhardt Oval, Belmore Oval and Shark Park. While playing out of Kogarah may be beneficial for Olympic, there is no guarantee that Olympic is willing to commit long-term to the St.George district and contribute to the maintenance and improvement of Jubilee Oval.}",
