            "Bike thefts are a major issue on campus. There is campus police that patrols the area at random times. There are many cars that do not have the semester parking pass. They take up space for those who really need the parking. It is an issue that needs more attention. There are days where one can go without displaying the parking permit and one will not receive a ticket. In other words, there needs to be more patrolling and ticket-serving as there are those who really need parking.",
            "Although there is a school cafe, the menu list is relatively small. Waiting times and organization can get really out of hand during the first few weeks of instruction.",
            "Dorm Life not applicable.",
            "Depending on your major and daily schedule, class difficulty and rigor will be dependent. However, for the most part and from word of mouth, most class exams will consist of multiple choice, true and false, and short answer. Keep in mind, however, that it will depend on many factors such as what you define as rigorous and your academic level.",
            "Study and really put the effort into your courses. It is school, after all. If necessary, have a weekly schedule to manage your time wisely and have an agenda to keep track of deadlines and important dates. Look into Transfer Day during the month of September. Use Assist.ORG and Ratemyprofessor.com to make the best out of your semester. Accept every chance that is offered for PRIORITY registration. You will have the best selection of classes and schedules. Classes fill up fast so this is your chance. If you really want to save money on books, use CRAIGSLIST.ORG and search in the Books category. Most of the time, you find the book(s) for your class. No waiting needed and you can resell them instead of just returning them when you rent them. So use Craigslist, Craigslist, Craigslist!",
            "For a 100-year old community college, it is a very forestry and beautiful school. The student environment is friendly, one feels welcomed, and staff is friendly. The location is convenient and near major avenues and a highway."

Great for these types of students Students wanting to attend a four year university but not wanting to tackle all those expenses for the four/five years they attend that university. Also great for those wishing to attend a UC with guarantee transfer admission.
