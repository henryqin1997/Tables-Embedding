On the other hand, If the Master Controller (MC) was at Version 3.0 and the Border Router was at Version 3.2 that would NOT BE OK as the BR Minor Version Number is greater than the MC Minor Version Number. For Example: If the Master Controller (MC) was at Version 3.3 and the Border Router was at Version 3.1 that would be OK as the BR Minor version number is less than the MC minor version number. The _Minor Version_ of the BR must be Less Than or Equal To the _Minor Version_ of the MC for a connection to be established. The _Major Version_ numbers must be identical AND",
