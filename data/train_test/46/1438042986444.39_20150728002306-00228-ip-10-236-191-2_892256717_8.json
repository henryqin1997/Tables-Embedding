            "The campus is monitored 24/7. There have not been any serious incidents in years. The supportive atmosphere of the college discourages criminals. There is also a police station on campus.",
            "Fun loving but studious students will find their place here. Also, being a christian based college, you will find a place for your faith to grow here in the warm and loving atmosphere on this college.",
            "The Clock Tower is an awesome gathering place on campus. Whether you just want a place to sit while you eat a banana or hang with someone special, under the Clock Tower is a great place to go on campus.",
            "The 26k tuition is a staggering door price but the services, the atmosphere, faculty, students, and the experience are worth so much more!",
            "Union College is overflowing with many student activities. Each student is required to participate with at least to student clubs each year. From Project Impact one of the longest ongoing community volunteering projects around to many local hot spots for students to visit and spend time together with the community.",
            "Union College's Union Market is one of the best cafeterias out there. There are tons of healthy and nutritious choices. Union's Cafeteria is a great place not only to eat but also to study. It's a very professional dining hall.",
            "At Union, the deans are very helpful in finding you a roommate. The dorms are usually fairly quiet allowing for great study. The students are very friendly and dorm life is really just living with your best friends.",
            "Life is fun but challenging. Union College strives to challenge their students and help them build confidence. When students leave Union they are equipped and ready to serve the community around them.",
            "1. Ask lots of questions 2. Seek out study partners 3. Stay focused, just because it's a fun place, the classes are still challenging",
            "Union College has a blossoming family oriented campus atmosphere where a responsive faculty and school spirit driven student body works together to create a better future. Union strives to help students find their place in the world and teach them the skills they need to make a positive affect on the world around them."

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck While an education at Union College is quite pricey, I definitely agree that it is worth every last cent. Am enjoying being here I made friends right away when I came to Union and I can already tell that we will be friends for life. The people here make everything worthwhile. Everybody is so inviting and friendly that it's hard to not have a good time. Am learning a lot Professors at Union have an impressive knowledge of the content area and related areas of knowledge. They also strive to connect interdisciplinary ways of thinking and provide an all-around excellent educational experience. There is a very good combination of lecture and discussion at Union College.
