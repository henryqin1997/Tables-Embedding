Hence one third of self-employed persons ceased active operations and that affected the total number of operating business entities, writes LETA., 2649=During the years 2009 and 2010, the number of major enterprises declined significantly, by 12% and 16%, respectively. In 2011, they grew in number; 16 enterprises with the staff of at least 250 were added to the register., 2110=The number of registered self-employed persons has fallen since 2007 and in 2011, their number declined by nearly 2,000.
