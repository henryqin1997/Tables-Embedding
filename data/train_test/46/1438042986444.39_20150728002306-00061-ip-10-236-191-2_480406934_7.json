    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{18589=A simple and effective technique to reduce the peak lateral field is to lower the supply voltage to the transistor. This solution, while effective, has not been adapted by integrated circuit manufacturers because a majority of the other components used by IC consumers operate with a standard 5 volt supply. The reluctance of IC manufactures to reduce power supply voltages has led to a number of techniques for minimizing short channel effects in sub-micron transistors, the most common being the lightly-doped drain (LDD) structure. A conventional LDD structure comprises an N-region in proximity to the transistor channel and an N+region displaced away from the channel by the width of the N-region. As the length of the transistor channel is reduced, transistors fabricated using a conventional LDD structure show increased substrate current (ISUB) and lower breakdown voltages (BVDSS). A reduction of the dopant concentration in the N-region improves ISUB and BVDSS however, other parameters such as threshold voltage stability and drive current are degraded because impact ionization and series resistance both increase. The failure of the conventional LDD structure in preventing performance degradation due to short channel effects in 0.5 micron transistors led to the development of channel doping modification techniques such as the double implanted LDD as described by S. Orura, et al., IEDM Tech. Digest, p. 718, 1982 and the triple diffused LDD structure, described by S. Rathman, et al., IEDM Tech. Digest, p. 237, 1983. Both techniques employ sidewall spacers to shift the peak lateral electric field away from the channel region and counter dope the interface between the source and drain regions and the channel. The introduction of minority carriers into the perimeter of the channel, however, diminishes the ability of the gate to modulate the electric field within the channel region thereby reducing the transconductance (Gm) of the transistor., 27029=The inventive process continues with the formation of a positive charge in oxide layer 28, as shown in FIG. 3. The positive charge is imparted to oxide layer 28 by ion implantation of an electropositive element having a low electronegativity, small ionization potential and small diffusion coefficient in silicon oxide. In one embodiment the electropositive element is selected from a member of the alkali metals such as Rubidium or Cesium. Preferably, Cesium ions are implanted having a maximum concentration midway into oxide layer 28. The Cesium ions, (illustrated as + symbols in FIG. 3) created a positive potential in the implanted portions of gate oxide layer 22. The ability of Cesium ions, resident in a silicon oxide, to form a negative image charge in a semiconductor substrate is described by J. T. Watt, et al., IEEE Trans. Electron Devices, (36) 1, 1989., 20574=The reduction of the N-doping level in the LDD structure is essential to maintain a high BVDSS in a sub-half micron N-channel transistor. Recently modified-gate LDD structures have been developed that preserve the improved short channel characteristics of the LDD structure and avoid transistor performance degradation. The modified structures include the gate-drain-overlapped LDD (GOLD) described by R. Izawa, et al., IEDM Tech. Digest, p. 38, 1987 and the inverse-TLDD (ITLDD) transistor described by T. W. Huang, et al., IEDM Tech. Digest, p. 742, 1986. Both structures seek to bring the N-region under gate control by overlapping the gate and reducing the N-dopant concentration of the LDD structure. A low series resistance is maintained because the overlapped gate can effectively accumulate the underlying N-region. Collectively known as a fully overlapped gate-drain, these techniques change the shape of the convention polysilicon transistor gate by creating thin gate extensions that overlie the N-region of the LDD structure. Although the modified gate techniques allow a reduced N-doping, the fabrication of sub-micron transistors using either the GOLD process or the ITLDD process involve difficult etch steps to create the gate extensions.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Thus it is apparent that there has been provided, in accordance with the invention, an improved MOS transistor structure and a method for its fabrication which fully meets the objects and advantages set forth above. Although particular embodiments of the invention have been described in the foregoing description, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that numerous modifications and variations can be made to the presented embodiments which still fall within the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the invention is not to be limited to the particular fabrication sequence set forth to fully describe the invention. In particular, the N+region can be formed prior to the formation of the N-region. Accordingly, it is intended that all such variations and modifications as fall within the scope of the appended claims and equivalents thereof be included within the invention. From the foregoing discussion it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that an analogous P-channel transistor can be formed by the inventive process wherein an electronegative atom is imparted to oxide layer 28. A corresponding positive charge image can be created in substrate 14 by the introduction of an electronegative element such as Iodine into oxide layer 28. When substrate 14 is doped to be N-type, the electric field created by the Iodine ions will attract positive charges or holes to the surface of substrate 14 creating a depletion region.",
