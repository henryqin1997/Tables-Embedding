Your individuality comes under the influence of your Sun in Gemini, which denotes a humane, intellectual, and kind disposition. Your whole life will be inwardly centered through education and intellectual pursuit. People regard you as clever. Under stress you hesitate to take a course that must be hastily determined. However, what you lack in this respect is completely compensated for by your fine intellect. You like to dwell on concepts, and you have a broad humanistic view of life. You abhor violence, finding it incomprehensible. If you could do whatever you wanted in life, you would definitely concern yourself exclusively with intellectual activities. Externally, your personality does not completely agree with your feelings. Because of education and other environmental influences, your personality has been centered on achieving material goals, and you have somehow identified with them completely. Your inner self, however, does not coincide with these matters. It is up to you to",
