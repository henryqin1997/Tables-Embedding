If the bug report is not clear or does not provide enough information to reproduce the bug, leave a note asking politely for the information you would need to be able to try and reproduce the bug, and add it to the Bugs needing more information section. If you cannot reproduce the bug, put a comment stating that (with your Kopete/KDE version) on the bug report in bugzilla, and add it to the Bugs no longer present in KDE 4 section. If you are able to reproduce the bug, add a comment on bugzilla saying what version of Kopete/KDE you are running and that you managed to reproduce the bug. Then add it to the Bugs still present in KDE 4 section. For each bug in the list, you should try and reproduce it using the information provided in the bug report.
