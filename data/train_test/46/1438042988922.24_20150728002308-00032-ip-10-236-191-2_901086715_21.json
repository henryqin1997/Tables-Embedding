Food and Dining the food is actually pretty good and the employees make sure you get it fast so your not late to class. Dorm Life there are no dorms. Academic Rigor some teachers are kinda crazy and really hard graders but that's the difference between college and high school. most of the teachers are really nice and will help you as much as they can. Tips for prospective students you should definitely apply, even if it's not your first choice you can always have a back up plan. if you want to make the more affordable option this is the way to go. In three sentences it's very laid back and easy going. the students come from all different backgrounds of life. you learn a lot from the time your there. Login to rate or flag",
