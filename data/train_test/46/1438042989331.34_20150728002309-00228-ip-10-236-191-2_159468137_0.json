Right under it, \u2018Argo\u2018 grossed $4 million for a grand total of $92 million. With so much competition around the corner, it has another week or two before its gone, but it\u2019ll do so after squeaking past the $100 million mark. In a year full of massive blockbusters, \u2018Argo\u2019s quiet success may be the most impressive box office showing of 2012.}",

In fact, \u2018The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2\u2018 had the second biggest opening of the franchise and when you consider how huge these things tend to open, that\u2019s a big accomplishment. However, this was not just a victorious weekend for Twi-hards \u2014 just about every film in the top ten had something to cheer about.

    "textAfterTable": "\u00a0 With $141.3 million in its first weekend, \u2018Breaking Dawn Part 2\u2032 is just shy of \u2018New Moon\u2019s $142.8 million opening. Still, that\u2019s nothing to scoff at \u2014 if you can\u2019t top other films in your franchise, you can hopefully maintain consistency. The \u2018Twilight\u2019 franchise is nothing if not consistent thanks to its dedicated fanbase. \u2018Twilight\u2019 may often be the internet\u2019s punching bag, but when it comes to making money year in and year out without ever seeming to lost fans, these sexy vampires and werewolves are doing something right. Although they\u2019ve run out of books to adapt, expect them to find excuses to squeeze out more \u2018Twilight\u2019 movies for the foreseeable future. A special note: Lionsgate\u2019s acquisition of Summit means that this is the second film of their\u2019s to open above $125 million this year (the other being \u2018The Hunger Games\u2019). That\u2019s a record. Not bad for one of the newer kids on the block. Moving on: is there a better piece of counter-programming for \u2018Twilight\u2019 than James Bond? \u2018Skyfall\u2018 took a pretty large dip, but that\u2019s expected when you open with $90 million. 007\u2032s latest adventure made $41 million in its second week, which is roughly what \u2018Casino Royale\u2019 made in its first. With a two week total of $161 million, \u2018Skyfall\u2019 is only $7 million away from becoming the highest grossing Bond film of all time. That\u2019s huge news for a series that\u2019s been trucking for five decades. In the third spot, Steven Spielberg\u2019s",
