Also, the present invention may be employed in communications contexts other than ones based on the MBOA MAC. While various embodiments of the present invention have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not in limitation. Accordingly, it will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art that various changes in form and detail can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus, the breadth and scope of the present invention should not be limited by any of the above-described exemplary embodiments, but should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents. VIII. Conclusion may be coupled according to various techniques. One such technique involves coupling transceivers 520 and 524, processor 510, memory 512, and user interface 514 through one or more bus interfaces. In addition, each of these components is coupled to a power source, such as a rechargeable and/or removable battery pack (not shown). FIG. 5 The elements shown in shows that user interface 514 includes a user input portion 516 and a user output portion 518.",
