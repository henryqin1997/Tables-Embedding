They do offer vegetarian options in the meal plans, so I expect to eat in a lot, but if you have dietary restrictions, check on that first., 155014=eat crawfish, there are many activities on campus, and watching games at the cajun fields, 162352=If you are commuting to campus, you can park your car at Cajun Field and take the bus to campus. If you would like to live on campus, you can; however, it is extremely expensive. If you live on campus you must have a meal plan, which the food sucks! The moment you get here, make sure you get involved! Join every club possible. It will really enrich your experience and make it easier to acclimate to your new life., 104055=There are so many clubs and activities to get involved in on campus. Everyone who attends this university can find something to be a part of! The people are so friendly, and love to have a diverse community of people get together and share the Cajun experience!, 186786=Excellent food options besides the cafeteria. Food options range from cajun, greek, to food trucks, they just are not too reasonably priced., 177666=ULL is an excellent college. It is a smaller college than most colleges. It is also in the heart of cajun country so it has that Louisiana cajun spirit to it., 158472=Small-town people who don't want to leave home or be too far away from it. People who like Cajun culture., 10689=UL Lafayette is a beautiful campus great for serious academics, social butterflies, Artist, Educators, People interested in Greek life, Communications, Pre-Med, Pre-Law, Athletes, and many more. If you are seeking diversity on a beautiful campus with a large array of things to do and see, you Ragin Cajun material., 154777=I love the red and the cajun they make me feel at home, 299733=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 37251=Everything is worth the price except food and housing. Don't live at the legacy if you're not having a friend as a roommate because 9/10, you'll get an inconsiderate one. The dorms save you about $1000-$2000 a semester,compared to an apt. at 4000. It's a big save of money, but not a big save from sanity. I like the free activities though, like plays and orchestras., 117734=Apply for scholarships for the school fast, the deadline is January 31st. Visit the campus and take a tour of your college. For example, I attended Fall Preview Day and met the Dean of the Liberal Arts College and that experience sold me on UL., 251764=The University of Louisiana at Lafayette has newly renovated dorms as of the 2013-2014 school year and residence-life organizations go above and beyond to make sure that the freshmen who are required and other students who choose to stay in the dorms are well taken care of and have plenty of things to do., 138558=The traditions are those of a Cajun. During Laniappe Week they have a crawfish boil for students, faculty, and community; canoe races; and a fashion show., 209850=This school is great for cajun students because they are very proud of that here. Our mascot is a pepper and we go by the term 'ragin' cajuns.', 11979=There are a lot of complaints about the slow rising of tuition and fees here and UL Lafayette, however, it is one of the less expensive schools in Louisiana. Paying a little over $7,000 dollars, I get to live on campus in an apartment with my two best friends, eat 12 meals a week (including weekends) in the Cafeteria, and with declining balance eat at any other food place on campus. Living in the dorms, you got nice facilities, a great room, and free access to Washers and Dryers. I also get to enter any of the UL Lafayette home sporting events for free as well as free transportation to and from such school sponsored events and south campus by bus during the day. A shuttle brings students to south campus as well as anywhere else on campus at night until 12 midnight . Being a Ragin Cajun also gains you entrance into the newly renovated recreation hall with pool and rock wall. I am given an Academic Advisor to assist me with scheduling and access to a wealth of information in our school library., 295543=Luckily the new student union will be finished in spring of 2014, so there will be a new cafeteria and a few more eating establishments. However from my experience, the cafeteria is not vegetarian friendly at all. Vegetarians should get a meal plan with a lot of declining balance because there are other campus eateries that serve vegetarian options., 246944=The University of Louisiana at Lafayette is a very diverse and cultured university due to the Cajun heritage. The school along with its athletic programs are vastly expanding. The professors are there to help the students succeed., 239267=The food in the cafeteria is outstanding. There are many different things to choose from. There are also many other places on and around the campus to choose to eat that you can use your Cajun card for purchasing., 122428=So the cafeteria/dining hall food sucks right now. However they are rebuilding the Student Union which will be finished next semester, so fall 2014. The new Union is huge and looks gorgeous from the work I am seeing be done. Therefore I expect the food to get better once the staff is out of the make shift kitchen that they are using now. The dining hall is the only place your meal plan works on campus but you do have a decking balance (DB) which works at multiple food venues on campus. You can use your DB in the food court which has Pizza Hut ChikFilA and Sushi, the Coffee shop in the Library, Campus Grounds, and Zeus. Also there is another area to use your DB at which is located near the Legacy Apartments., 176559=The food is AMAZING. You are in the heart of cajun country so you not only get home cooked food, sushi, Quiznos, pizza, sushi, etc., but there are many amazing places to eat off campus as well., 234569=You can put money on your cajun card which also serves as your school ID! Everything is just about free.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Troy from Gretna, LA 07/27/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 19 out of 19 people found this review useful. 2 of 71 Categories Comments Great for these types of students The good thing about UL is they have people who are willing to help with whatever problems you may have at your request, and usually free of charge. The Learning Center in Lee Hall (on Hebrard St, next to the Physics building) has free tutoring for almost every subject. And Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD, in the Conference Center - first floor) is available for students who may need learning accommodations such as a note taker, or a designated student who takes good notes for you to compare with your own. Stop by either office for more information Tips for prospective students If you are parking on campus (which usually means you must live on campus), be sure to get your parking permit asap. The office (on Hebrard St., across from Martin Hall and the post office) tends to have a LONG line, especially on dorm check-in days, so arrive a little before they open, if",
