Once, I was leaving the library at about 8 o'clock at night after a serious study session and I expected to be freaked out when going outside after dark, but the campus felt really safe.

Teachers that you don't even have will ask you about your day and classes, they'll even offer any help that you would need. As well with the students, everyone is very talkative and welcoming.

The school is one of the cheapest forms of higher education in the Chicago land area. Recently it was ranked amongst the highest schools with the less amount of graduates leaving without debt. Am enjoying being here Student life at NEIU is complicated as the school is a commuter school. Needless to say many friendly people attended this university and there\u2019s always something to get involved in.",
