OPs range from 1 to 25, with one being the best and 25 being 'did you even attend school.' Australia Australia's end of year high school exams vary from state to state. But a new system called ATAR has been introduced to standardize the final high school scores of students from all states except Queensland. Scores are based on percentiles. The highest score is 99.95, which indicates that the student has achieved a total score which is higher or equal to 99.95% of the total student population. The minimum score is 30.00, indicating that the student has achieved a total score which is higher or equal to 30% of the total student population. Anything below that is considered as below 30 rather than given an exact percentile, since it does not indicate anything other than that the student didn't bother to study for the exam at all, and can be quite de-motivating. As a guide, the University of Melbourne requires around 95.00 or above to study Commerce there, 87.00 for Science and 98.00 for Biomedicine. A less demanding university might require only 60.00 for entry into its Engineering program.",
    "textAfterTable": "X You didn't turn up to the exam There are three tiers to GCSE, foundation, intermediate, and higher, however intermediate isn't used for all subjects, just Maths and the like, just like some exams don't have any tiers, such as History, Geography, etc. The best grade for higher is A* , and the best grade for foundation is C. Where it exists, intermediate tends to range to B. It must be be noted by the reader that A* is not the near unattainable distinguisher that \"Best. Score. Ever.\" seems to represent. It is not particularly hard for an academic student who studies to get an A*. All A*s however, is seriously impressive. A-levels: Graded A* to E. You can guess which is the best and the worst.
