            "Campus Police does an awesome job. If you ever need help or don't feel safe going somewhere, they are ready to help at any minute. I have their number saved in my phone in case of emergencies.",
            "I'm in a sorority here and I love it! I can't imagine not being Greek. It has opened so many doors for me and I've met so many awesome people. I know my sisters have my back and I have theirs.",
            "There are so many different organizations on campus that it's actually hard to choose from. There are so many I wanted to be involved in and had to drop a few.",
            "Great for every type of student who wants to get a hands on education",
            "During the football game, Phi Sigma Kappa sets off a cannon after every touchdown, the Bell Tower plays random music sometimes",
            "I absolutely feel like I'm getting value for my money. I love it so much here and every penny is worth it.",
            "Maryville is really small, but there is so much to do. There's the bowling alley, movie theatre, and Mozingo Lake just to name a few. The University also puts on a bunch of stuff to keep students entertained like concerts, comedians, game nights, etc.",
            "The Food Court is nice, but the lines can get really long and the food can get really expensive. They can also get stingy about how much food you actually get. Having Papa John's is really nice in the Runt and you can use your aladine to order pizza in town.",
            "I love living in the high rises. Everyone leaves their doors open when we're here and I've met so many new people that way. All the RA's are really fun and I feel like I can go to them with anything. Our floor does lots of stuff together also, like dinner, movie night, etc.",
            "I feel like all my classes are difficult, but not impossible to do well in. I really have to focus and study almost every night. The Talent Development Center also provided me with a tutor to help in my hardest class. I'm doing well in all my courses, but I do have to work hard.",
            "Be open to meeting new people, be prepared to study even your freshman year, get involved on campus, take care of yourself",
            "Northwest is the perfect school because everyone here is so welcoming. I live in the high rises and feel like I know everyone. I love that it's a small school, but not too small; I feel like I can talk to all my teachers about how I'm doing in the class and that I'm more than just a number."

Northwest is a great school but the town Maryville can get very cold and have very strong winds. Please dress accordingly., 258487=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 183739=The campus is switching to a new dining plan in the 2013 Fall semester. According to the new plan there will be many great places to eat. There is also a small store that you can buy snack food and other supplies (trash bags, cleaning supplies) and is open 24hours. You can also use your meal card on the vending machines all over campus for a quick snack., 59250=The bang for your buck is probably one of the best you can get in Missouri and around northern Missouri. If you did A+ in the Missouri Schools then you get an easy 1500 bucks a year for 3 years, and all you need to keep is a 3.0 GPA. Even though it's a cheaper college the level of education that comes with it is awesome, its definitely a bang for your buck starting at around 14,000 a year., 180618=Lots of options for places to live. May live in a new suite style dorm, the older dorms, apartments, frat houses, etc. Many options off campus also., 133724=The Hangars ( movies), Outback, Molly's, the Lake. There are also event such as speakers, comedy shows, and other performers that come to the school. The events are usually free. This past October 4 comedians performed at our school for free and the last guest was Steve'O from Jackass. There is always something to do on campus for free.}",

Tips for prospective students Be prepared for the challenges the teachers will throw at you, and be ready to have fun. I have yet to go a day without there being something interesting and fun to do. Bang for the buck The school has some of the most top of the line equipment in the CIE building and education wise you are getting what you pay for. Not to mention the food is decent and reasonably priced. Am enjoying being here There are lots of interesting people meet",
