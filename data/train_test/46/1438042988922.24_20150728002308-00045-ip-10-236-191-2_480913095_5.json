The present invention is applicable to the display device 2102, the voice input unit 2103, and other signal control circuits.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{79435=Next, an impurity having the same conductivity as the former step is added again. The concentration of the impurity added at this time is made higher than that at the former step. In this embodiment, arsenic is used as the impurity, and the concentration is made 1\ufffd1021 atoms/cm3. However, it is not necessary to make limitation to this. By the addition step of the impurity, a source region 208, a drain region 209, an LDD region 210, and a channel formation region 211 are defined (FIG. 2C)., 71089=Next, hydrogen is added through the silicon oxide film 102 from the side of the main surface of the single crystal silicon substrate 101. In this case, the hydrogen addition may be carried out as the form of hydrogen ions using an ion implantation method. Of course, the addition step of hydrogen may be carried out by other means. In this way, a hydrogen-containing layer 103 is formed. In this embodiment, a hydrogen ion with a dosage of 1\ufffd1016 to 1\ufffd1017 atom/cm2 is added (FIG. 1B)., 62368=As single crystal silicon, although that formed by an FZ method and that formed by a CZ method exist, in the present invention, it is preferable to use single crystal silicon formed by the FZ method. In the CZ method which is the main stream at present, oxygen of about 2\ufffd1018 atoms/cm3 is contained for the purpose of relieving stress, so that there is a fear that an electron or hole mobility is lowered. Particularly, in the case where a minute TFT is formed, this comes to appear remarkably., 54732=As another SOI technique attracting attention, there is a technique called Smart-Cut (registered trademark of SOITEC Co.). The Smart-Cut method is a technique developed by SOITEC Co. in France in 1996, and is a method of fabricating a bonded SOI substrate using hydrogen embrittlement. The particular technique of the Smart-Cut method is disclosed in \u201cIndustrial Research Society (Kogyo Cbosa Kai); Electronic Material, August, pp. 83-87, 1977\u201d in detail., 84850=After the porous silicon layer 302 is formed, it is preferable to carry out a heat treatment step in a reducing atmosphere and within a temperature range of 900 to 1200\ufffd C. (preferably 1000 to 1150\ufffd C.). In this embodiment, a heat treatment at 1050\ufffd C. for 2 hours is carried out in a hydrogen atmosphere., 50798=This application is a Reissue application of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/731,415 filed Mar. 30, 2007 (now U.S. Pat. No. 7,473,971 issued Jan. 6, 2009 ) which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/914,357, filed on Aug. 9, 2004, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,476,576, issued Jan. 13, 2009, which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/808,162, filed on Mar. 13, 2001 (now U.S. Pat. No. 6,803,264 issued Oct. 12, 2004) which is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/386,782, filed on Aug. 31, 1999 (now U.S. Pat. No. 6,335,231 issued Jan. 1, 2002), and claims the benefit of a foreign priority application filed in Japan as Serial No. 10- 251635 on Sep. 4, 1998. This application claims priority to each of these prior applications., 88910=Next, the porous silicon layer 302 is subjected to wet etching and is selectively removed. As an etchant to be used, a mixed solution of a hydrofluoric acid solution and a hydrogen peroxide solution is preferable. It is reported that a solution of a mixture of 49% HF and 30% H2O2 at a ratio of 1:5 has a selecting ratio of a hundred thousand times or more between a single crystal silicon layer and a porous silicon layer., 84101=First, a single crystal silicon substrate 301 having a main surface (crystal face) of a {110} plane is prepared. Next, the main surface is subjected to anodization to form a porous silicon layer 302. The anodization step may be carried out in a mixed solution of hydrofluoric acid and ethanol. The porous silicon layer 302 is regarded as a single crystal silicon layer provided with columnar surface holes at a surface density of about 1011 holes/cm3, and succeeds to the crystal state (orientation, etc.) of the single crystal silicon substrate 301 as it is. Incidentally, since the ELTRAN method itself is well known, the detailed description will be omitted here., 54221=Among the bonded SOI substrates, in recent years, attention has been especially paid to a technique called ELTRAN (registered trademark by Canon K.K.). This technique is a method of fabricating an SOI substrate using selective etching of a porous silicon layer. The particular technique of the ELTRAN method is disclosed in, K. Sakaguchi et al., \u201cCurrent Progress in Epitaxial Layer Transfer (ELTRAN)\u201d, IEICE TRANS. ELECTRON. Vol. E80 C. No. 3 pp. 378-387 March 1997, in detail., 73894=Next, as a second heat treatment, a furnace annealing step is carried out in a temperature range of 1050 to 1150\ufffd C. In this step, at the bonded interface, stress relaxation of Si\u2014O\u2014Si bonds occurs, so that the boned interface becomes stable. That is, this becomes a step of completely bonding the single crystal silicon layer 106 to the supporting substrate. In this embodiment, this step is carried out at 1100\ufffd C. for 2 hours., 62918=However, in the case where single crystal silicon is used for the SOI substrate as in the present invention, since there are many cases where the thickness of a single crystal silicon layer required for an active layer of a TFT is as very thin as 10 to 50 nm, it is not quite necessary to take stress into consideration. Thus, even if the FZ method (oxygen content is 1\ufffd1017 atoms/cm3 or less), which can form single crystal silicon more inexpensively than the inexpensive CZ method, is used, satisfactory effects can be obtained.}",
