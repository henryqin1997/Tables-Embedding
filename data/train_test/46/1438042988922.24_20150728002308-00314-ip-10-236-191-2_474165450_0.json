    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{22127=Social media was incredibly central to London 2012 and its success. It was the first time such a global sporting event of this kind had put social media at the heart of its communications plan, and I think it showed how incredibly successful that move can be. Fans were able to interact with one another, relaying news of race wins in an instant. They were also able to interact with athletes via Twitter in a way that could never be done before. Finally, organizers were able to push out messages and listen to public response through their social media channels, allowing them to be well informed and pro-active with external communications., 20984=iprovision was set up by the Institute back in 1965 and continues to provide vital support for those who need it. Iprovision operates independently from the CIPR but all of its Trustees are Members or Fellows of the Institute with a wealth of experience at hand, and a desire to continue the fabulous work the charity does., 26704=November is a very busy month for CIPR, and we have some exciting events taking place, none more so than our Social Media and Internal Communications conferences. I think the overwhelming theme of those two days will be engagement. Whether this is engaging internally with employees or externally with consumers, it is vital that professionals are using the tools available to listen and respond in a responsible and well thought out manner. I think another focus will be on the future. Looking ahead to the possibilities for the PR profession is very exciting and I hope that CIPR can continue to lead on events, guidance, services, professional development and industry leadership, all of which will continue to drive us forward and improve the profession for all., 26402=November is going to be a busy month for CIPR with the Social Media Conference (London, November 1, 2012) and the Internal Communications Conference (London, November 7, 2012). What themes will be the main focus of these two events?, 24856=We all know that Wikipedia is the most-read online encyclopaedia, with editions in 285 languages, and at the beginning of 2012 CIPR announced its work with it on \u201cthe definition of a clear guidance for PR profession\u201d. What are the main challenges for PR professionals when dealing with Wikipedia entries? What is the main focus of this project?}",
