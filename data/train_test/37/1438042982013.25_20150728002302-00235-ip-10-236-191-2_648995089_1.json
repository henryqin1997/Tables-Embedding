I like sports such as: basketball, baseball, and football. I use to play baseball back in high school. I just graduated with my degree in engineering, I hope to work on devices that will help aid doctors in the operating room in orthopedic surgeries. I enjoy playing sports and hangout with friends in my free time. Anything else you would like to know, please feel free to ask. Add to Favorites!",
