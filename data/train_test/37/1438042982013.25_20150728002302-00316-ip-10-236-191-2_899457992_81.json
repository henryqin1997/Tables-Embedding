            "There are several options including a Quizno's, Chick-fil-a, and the buffet style cafeteria, but I rarely used any of these because they're all expensive. There is also BuckMart, like a convenience store, that I went to a few times out of desperation. They don't have a bad selection, but, again, it's expensive. I always brought food from home.",
            "I didn't live in a dorm, but I didn't hear too many complaints from those you lived on campus.",
            "I was in English HiD classes and always felt like ETSU had sufficient academic rigor to keep my challenged, especially once you get into the higher level classes. None of the classes I took were too insane, but if you want an A, you're going to have to study and put some effort into the classes. The difficulty does often depend on the professor, but there is free tutoring offered the Academic Center on the first floor on the library to help you get the grade you need/want.",
            "1. Be on top of your financial aid. Apply for everything early and check back often. Financial aid is INSANE the first couple of weeks of school. Also, don't be alarmed if the aid doesn't show up until a week or two (or even days) before classes start. I don't if it's the school or the state that causes the delay, but it can take a bit. Don't worry about it though--as long as you're anticipating aid there's a paper you can sign in the Financial Aid office that will hold your classes until the aid shows up so you don't get purged. 2. If you're eligible for an Honors program, do it. No questions asked, no hesitation, just join. ETSU has Honors-in-Disciple (Hid), along with Midway scholars, and University Honors program. HiD programs allow you to take Honors classes in specific areas of study like English, History, Biology, and many others. These classes are much smaller and more focused. The are also classes that may be offered only once and are only open for HiD students. So, if the more difficult class causes you problems, the professor will have more time to help since the class is smaller. There is no getting lost in the crowd with these classes are generally taught by seasoned professors, not a graduate assistant who hasn't taught before. 3. Parking and Food. The first two weeks of school is going to be a parking nightmare. Unless you're willing to walk a mile (I'm not exaggerating), suck it up and get to school early if you have any sort of morning classes. Eight in the morning is a good time to aim for. Parking in the evening is much better and parking in the middle of the semester usually isn't a problem. Parking only becomes an issue again the last two weeks of class when everyone who's skipped realized they should probably attend class. There are vending machines and places to eat on and near campus, but they're all expensive. Buy some snacks at the grocery store and bring them with you.",
            "ETSU was a pleasant, rewarding experience for me; you will get out of this school what you put into it. Parking is horrible, but they're building a parking garage, which should help and is something students have been asking for for years. Overall, I enjoyed ETSU and do not regret choosing to attend undergraduate school here."

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students ETSU is a great campus for anybody. It's a good size. It's close to EVERYTHING! Everyone there is so friendly and helpful. It really doesn't take long to get into the groove of ETSU. It'll feel like home in no time. Tips for prospective students Some tips for students: Definitely take a tour of the campus. Try to get a feel for it before you decide that's where you want to live for the next 1 - 4 years. Ask questions! There's never a stupid question; and people are always eager to help you out! Bang for the buck Compared to a LOT of colleges I was looking at, ETSU was definitely the cheapest. And I feel that I'm getting a wonderful education. Am enjoying being here ETSU always has something going on! Our calender is loaded with events! There's something to do almost every single day. There's tons of restaurants and places to shop within ten minutes from campus. And the people are just great to be around! Am learning a lot All the teachers I've had so far really take",
