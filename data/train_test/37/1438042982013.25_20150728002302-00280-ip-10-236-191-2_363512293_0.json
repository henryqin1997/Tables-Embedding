You can copy and paste the definition in your ~/.claws-mail/actionsrc file (exit Claws Mail before). The syntax is very simple: one line per action, each action contains the menu name and the command line separated by a colon and a space \": \". Alternatively, you can use Configuration -> Actions... and for each example enter a menu name and copy&paste the text after the colon and space \": \" in the command definition. Examples When a command is run, and unless it is run asynchronously, Claws Mail will be insensitive to any interaction and it will wait for the command to finish. If the command takes too long (5 seconds), it will popup a dialog window allowing to stop it. This dialog will also be displayed as soon as the command has some output: error messages or even its standard output when the command is not a \"pipe-out\" command. When multiple commands are being run, they are run in parallel and each command output is separated from the outputs of the others. Note: It is not possible to use actions containing %f, %F or %p from the compose window. Appending the \"greater than\" sign > will insert the command output in the message. The difference between the trailing | is that no text will be deleted or replaced. Most used when composing",

The latter can be replaced by any document viewer/editor. The script creates a temporary file (/tmp/uuooffice-<docname>) and deletes it after you close OpenOffice. The tnef-claws bash script was written by Shawn Lamson and is to be found here. The script is well commented. You need to have the tnef package already installed.
