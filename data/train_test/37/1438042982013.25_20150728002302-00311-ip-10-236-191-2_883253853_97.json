            "With a 24-hours surveillance system and police patrols driving around campus there is little to worry about. Scattered throughout campus are multiple emergency beacons that signal the police for anyone in need of help. Because the campus is small and everyone is family, students do not hesitate to help someone in need regardless of circumstance. It's one of the safest campuses I know.",
            "The biggest organizations SWAT and Student Government, getting into these two groups is easy and fun. SWAT focuses on the exciting events like laser-tag games and huge slippin slide relays, while Student Government focuses on giving students a voice in the events that happen on campus and bringing new things to campus. Last year, Student Government persuaded the school to make shirts for the hundreds of different events that happened on campus to give to students for free!",
            "This is a great school for intimidated, shy students and for students looking to get a great education while still having fun at college. With friendly people all around and a plethora of campus organizations to join it's easy to become part of the Texan Family.",
            "The students there take great pride in their colors, purple and white and any student caught wearing another school's apparel can expect piercing and scrutinizing looks from the other students. Every Thursday is Purple Thursday where students will deck themselves out in as much purple as they can, as well as the Chick-Fil-A sells Purple vanilla milkshakes to support their students too!",
            "The only movie theatre in Stephenville is awesome for new releases and for price! Tickets are priced at what most would pay for a matinee and on Wednesdays tickets drop down to $3, so take the date for a relaxing night in a comfortable theatre.",
            "While the little town of Stephenville is seriously lacking in the entertainment district students are very creative in having fun. For the country-born students, there are numerous back-roads to be explored. For the city slicks, there are a few places to shop and close surround towns that have beaches and department stores. Some of the best ways to cure boredom is to get involved with some of the 140+ campus organizations. There are events going on almost every day of the year, so there is no lack in socialization or fun! If you like to dance, there is also City-Limits that I highly encourage every student to go at least once in their first year! It's always packed with guys and gals itchin to dance so shine your shoes and have fun!",
            "The most important part of college life, food. While there is only one dining hall on the 140 acres of campus they also make up for it with the multiple food courts and close surrounding food restaurants. After the first semester the food can get old, but its 5x better than the high school cardboard meals you're used to. There are multiple food options available at every meal, international food, sub sandwich shop, breakfast bar (open all day), fast food type meals, vegetarian and gluten free food, pizzeria and pasta bar, and a mama's home cooking line. It is a pretty decent selection and it's pretty good.",
            "Most of the dorms have been renovated, or are under construction, and in comparison to other colleges I visited they are some of the better looking rooms. Most people leave their doors open when their present making it easy to make friends with your neighbors and those around you. They are all fully furnished with a microwave and fridge so its well worth the money to live in the residential halls.",
            "While this is a smaller, lesser known college don't let it fool you as being academically easy. The professors are very well read in their respective fields, and they are also very approachable and enjoy connecting with ambitious students to discuss class material. The work load is easily manageable if you want to pick up a part time job and still have a social life.",
            "The best way to adjust and get connected is by attending Duck Camp. There you'll meet most of your classmates and friends as well as becoming part of the Texan family. Don't be shy the people at TSU are some of the friendliest I've ever met!",
            "If you are worried about being a number at a larger university, then have no fear Tarleton is a great college to transition to from high school. It's population of 10,000 students means smaller class sizes, better connections with professors, and more friends. With a high respect for tradition, here you can find pride in your school!"

The Poo Say signs appear on campus every Tuesday morning and occasionally comment on campus political life and student life. The Poo Say signs are nailed to the trees on campus and most are designed to promote school spirit. Purple Poo members appear in public dressed in costume to conceal their identity. Many members un-mask at the Leadership and Service Awards Ceremony each April while others choose to have their pictures appear in the Grassburr. At commencement, graduating members will pass a purple pig to the university president as they pass across the stage., 367252=Has amazing professors. Has a lot of country people and cowboys. May not be the best for people from the city., 78348=Apply early for the scholarship deadline, Dec. 1. Also, choose to be in a Learning Community., 200950=Beginning in Fall 2012, new Tarleton Texans emerged on campus a week before classes began (Aug. 19-26). Students moved into their residence halls on Aug. 19 and experienced a week full of activities designed to help them meet their academic and social objectives. The week also guided students through the resources available to adjust to Tarleton's environment and culture. Please take advantage of this week. It was very helpful., 435279=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here I love the campus and love the people I've met there. Being with people that are striving for a similar goal to your own really helps you concentrate and pull your grades to where you want them. There is also a lot of organizations and activities on campus that are a lot of fun to partake in. Am learning a lot There is a wealth of knowledge at Tarleton State University. There is a huge variety of classes ranging from mathematics courses to musical courses to theatre courses. There are honors programs available, which I am a part of. The teachers at Tarleton care about the individual student if that student cares about his or her education. I feel so much more intelligent just being on campus and interacting with others in the honors program.
