The records were produced for G.A. Bryen Ltd of 81, Southwark Street, London, who was the proprietor of Selecta Gramophones Ltd. Selecta A 6\" disc, dating from the early 1950s, produced for children. Thanks to Bill Dean-Myatt for providing the label image. Selcol A product of Vogue records, Seeco records were available from 1954 to 1956, and the source for many of the recordings was Seeco records inc. of New York, USA.

    "textAfterTable": "Shamrock This is obviously an Irish label, the example I have here dates from the late 1920s. Thanks to research undertaken by Bill Dean Myatt, It has now been established that the masters used on this label were from Edison Bell (J.E. Hough) Ltd. Siemens The was a one-off record to advertise SIemens' Opal and Pearl light bulbs. There's a certain amount of mystery about the record, but I would assume it was given away, probably at an exhibition. Although the record is not rare, it is unusual to find it in it's original sleeve. The mystery is that it has a catalogue number, which you wouldn't expect for a special issue. The record is of the \"unbreakable\" format, probably made by Worldecho or Duophone (both q.v.). The band, however, has a Piccadilly label sound to it, so maybe it was a contract recording.",
