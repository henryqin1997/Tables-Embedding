And there was no formal training in cheese knowledge and handling, either. \"There are still too many people who don't even know how to wrap a cheese, who still use plastic and not cheese wrap. That suffocates cheese!\" He's been an active member of the American Cheese Society since it started and suggested questions to be included on the recently inaugurated Certified Cheese Exam.}",
