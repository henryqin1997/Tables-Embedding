The sheer improbability of aligning the stars and blasting a hole in pop culture for the work to reside is the kind of romantic notion that has launched a million bands. Australia's Augie March may be a tiny blip on the global radar, but that could all change if this second release, the mesmerizing Strange Bird, gets into the right hands.

In the heartbreaking \"Little Wonder,\" folksy guitars, swirling brass, and delicate piano wrap themselves around delicious imagery \u2014 \"On the wall behind some furniture there's a stain in the shape of Africa/O fear walks tall, when it's halfway up the hill with its friend alcohol\" \u2014 and sordid observations \u2014 \"Somebody blew their brains out in this room/I can feel it like it happened just this afternoon.\" On the raucous \"This Train Will Be Taking No Passengers,\" burning coal fuels train and band, as the narrator proclaims, \"Onward and on, this strange-wrought bird/Onwards and over the black coffee earth.\" The closing tune, the Roger Waters-inspired \"O Song,\" laments the painful birth of a lyric and the empty nest it leaves in the heart of the writer. The group is adept at balancing the brutal, the epic dirge \"Brundisium\" and the beautiful and minimal \"The Night Is a Blackbird,\" with a grace and dexterity that can only come from years of acquaintance. Those years have been well spent as Strange Bird is that rare piece of work that seems destined to age with you. One can only hope that this colorful bird from down under has, among all its other attributes, the gift of flight.
