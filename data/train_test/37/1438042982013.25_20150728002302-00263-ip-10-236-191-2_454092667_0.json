    "textBeforeTable": "There were three U.S. economic releases today. Twenty-four of the 30 Dow stocks are down for the day, with heavyweights IBM and Goldman Sachs\u00a0both dropping roughly 1.5%. New Dow component Nike reported earnings yesterday after the market close that flew past analyst expectations. Nike's earnings per share grew 34% to $0.86; analysts had expected earnings of $0.78. Revenue grew 8% to $6.97 billion, in line with analyst expectations. Fool contributors Daniel Miller and Michael Lewis have more on Nike's earnings. Nike's (NYSE: NKE\u00a0\u00a0) stock is up nearly 5% today after walloping earnings expectations, but that jump is not enough to pull the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI\u00a0\u00a0) into positive territory.

Inflation has been slowing over the past year and is well below the Federal Reserve's target of 2% to 2.5%. The big focus for the weekend is that lawmakers have until midnight Monday to pass some sort of budget, otherwise the government will shut down. The House passed a continuing resolution that extends the budget but defunds Obamacare. The Senate is expected to pass a continuing resolution this afternoon or tomorrow that includes funding for Obamacare, putting the House on the hook for either approving the continuing resolution with Obamacare funding or shutting down the government. The market can handle a government shutdown, but that possible outcome should leave investors more worried about the far larger potential obstacle of raising the debt ceiling.
