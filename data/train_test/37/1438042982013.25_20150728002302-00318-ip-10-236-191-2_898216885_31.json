            "Berry is extremely safe. The campus is big enough for its own zip code, and thus we have police patrolling the campus at all hours and the police station is housed right outside the main entrance. The gatehouse is attended at all hours. You can call them at any time if you feel unsafe walking around on campus. The dorm rooms are also regulated by ID cards, so certain people will not be able to get into certain building at specific times (e.g. guys' key cards will not work on girls' hallways after visiting hours).",
            "Berry does not have a Greek system.",
            "Berry offers a wide variety of clubs and activities to encourage a community atmosphere. Students are also required to go to a certain number of Cultural Events to graduate, which are always fun and interesting. There are endless things to do on campus.",
            "Berry College is great for any student who care to work hard for a better education and not seeking a party-school environment. If you love the outdoors, that's even better (though not required; there are still plenty of other things to do on campus). The most hands-on majors would be Animal Science and Education, since we have our own livestocks and farm, etc, on campus, along with a pre-school and elementary school.",
            "The biggest tradition on campus is Mountain Day, which is similar to homecoming. The day before is the Mountain Day Olympics, where afternoon classes are cancelled and dorms play against each other. During Mountain Day, parents and alumni are invited back on campus to watch the current students' march down the hill. Each gender in different class years wear different colors and drop pennies based on their age into a basket at the foot of the hill. They go down first in ones, march back up and join hands to march down in twos, then fours, then eights, then sixteens. That night, there will be a carnival called Marthapalooza held in the Clara bowl about six rides or so with various games.",
            "Given how much you pay, Berry College does make sure you get your worth in education and student life. They really take care of you and provide a lot of great opportunities for after college.",
            "Berry offers a lot of opportunity for outdoors activities like hiking and camping and other off-campus activities. Student activity (called KCAB) has something planned almost every week, and it's hard to miss the events because reminders are everywhere (on the Stall Wall and via email). Activities include Day Glow, movie nights, bowling, haunted trail, cultural film weeks, Mountain day Olympics, karaoke night, theatre plays, coffeehouses, pageants, concerts. Downtown and the movie theatre is also fairly close, but they're not the greatest. Berry also gives students plenty of opportunities for volunteering on and off campus. Student clubs are pretty open to sit-ins if you're not an executive member (e.g. SGA). There are also sporting events every week, including many intermural ones to participate if you're not an athlete.",
            "D-hall is great; I've not eaten at a better dining hall. They have a very wide and healthy variety and some of their recipes are even from parents'. Of course, there are still always those salads and pizza that are there everyday. Besides the dining hall, there are a few fast food options and coffee shops, including Starbucks.",
            "Almost all students are required to live on campus, so dorm life can be pretty fun. Genders are separated by floors and an underclassman can choose to room with an upperclassman if they want. Besides the traditional dorm rooms, there are also townhouses and cabins and suites. Berry is technically a dry campus so you won't get too much racket in the hallways. RAs are always friendly and willing to help.",
            "Berry prioritizes learning so academics rigor is fair. You WILL be graded according to your work input but professors are more than willing to help (not to mention student tutors and writing centers to also aid you).",
            "If you don't like the idea of learning, Berry College is definitely not a place for you. Since it's a liberal arts college, the general education is heavier than other schools. Also, Berry College's mission statement centers around the hand, heart, head, so expect to embrace volunteering along with learning.",
            "Berry encourages a very solid liberal arts learning. I think the campus is amazing and perfect for college students, whether studying or relaxing, and all the staffs and students are super-friendly. Moreover, their work study program provides so much opportunities and experiences; my job is perfect and I love it."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{145974=Every August, we have a tradition called Mountain Day. Students will gather on a specific hill on campus dressed in either pink, white, or blue. Pink for underclassmen girls, blue for underclassmen boys, blue for senior girls, and white for senior boys. Students then hold hands and march up and down the hill, dropping pennies in a basket at the bottom of the hill. At the end of the Grand March, the pennies are all donated to charity. Later that night, Berry hosts a Carnival on campus and all students get in for free., 232011=We have a Mountain Day celebration where we celebrate the colleges founding person. We have a big march and lots of festivities. then we have Marthapalooza, a carnival that comes on campus., 282964=Small rooms, some are very old, with large windows and beautiful views. Not many Coeds. (2013 should be the last year of all female dorms)., 313711=The Mountain Day March was amazing to watch. Looking back I wish I had taken part but at the time I thought it was odd., 165451=The biggest tradition on campus is Mountain Day, which is similar to homecoming. The day before is the Mountain Day Olympics, where afternoon classes are cancelled and dorms play against each other. During Mountain Day, parents and alumni are invited back on campus to watch the current students' march down the hill.

That night, there will be a carnival called Marthapalooza held in the Clara bowl about six rides or so with various games., 264217=No Greek life. Martha did not believe in greek life. Fall 2014 is the inaugural year for Football!, 265124=First weekend of October, we celebrate Mountain Day (Martha Berry's Birthday). That Friday there is olympics between the 7 dorm areas. Saturday is the traditional walk up the mountain with your fellow classmates, following that night is Marthapalooza, a theme park brought into the Clara Bowl. There are many great locations on campus. On main campus, I would recommend the Ford Buildings. It is very pretty. Remember the Titans was filmed there. The entire campus is beautiful. You can't beat it., 341556=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 90075=Wow, too many to talk about! We have a dairy and lots of cow fields, 26,000 acres covering all of Mount Berry, and historic sites all over. The original water wheel that supplied the early campus all of its water, the old brick factory that was originally used to start the school, and the old chapels and school buildings from the early 1900's. Marthapolooza is a giant fair on campus once a year in order to honor our founder, Martha Berry's, birthday. We do a grand march and parade and we get out of classes that day. It is so much fun., 94214=Berry is a large, outdoorsy campus with a student to deer ratio of 1:3 Classes are very difficult but you learn a lot and you are challenged every day which will help you out in the long run. Every student is offered a job on campus and you can get promoted as well; an RA is a level four job but the head RA is a level 5 job., 113007=The most important tradition, though not really that unusual, is Mountain Day, the Mountain Day Olympics, and Marthapalooza that occurs each year. These events are connected with the celebration of Martha Berry's birthday and occur within the first two weeks of October. For these events, the entire Berry Community comes together to celebrate. This includes faculty, staff, students, alumni, parents, and others who simply live on the Berry College Campus., 28541=WAYYYYY TOOOOOOOOO EXPENSIVE for out of state students. Food is gross and you pay over $2000 for the required meal plan. Dorm rooms are not in good shape. The academics are amazing, so basically the money is worth it for the classes:), 129659=The beautiful Berry College campus is nestled at the foot of Lavender Mountain and spans over 26000 acres. The liberal arts college provides an excellent array of degree programs, scholarship/grant opportunities, and has one of the nation's top student work programs. With only around 2000 students, class sizes are able to remain small so students can work closely with their peers and advisers relevant to their majors., 96514=one of our largest events and tradition on campus is a weekend called mountain day. this is the celebration of our founder's birthday and homecoming all rolled into one. we have mountain day olympics where the dorms compete against each other and against the faculty-staff team. the grand march, up on mountain campus, is a huge deal. the alumni come back and watch the current students carry on the 100 year old tradition of marching up and down the mountain. and our headliner event- marthapoolza, a mini-fair on campus. the whole weekend is always is themed and all the students are super involved., 328714=Berry has this tradition called Mountain Day that has been around since the school was created. It is the founder Martha Berry's birthday and all the students who want to participate wear white, pink and blue, march up and down a hill about 6 or 7 times, and put pennies in a basket. Soooooo.... yeah., 248647=Berry College is the only place where I can leave my $2000 computer, wallet, and iPhone sitting on a table unattended for over a half hour and not worry that someone will take it. Every building has scanners to get into them (including scanners on each hallway).}",
