December to March is the only time when the school's scholarships are open so apply as soon as possible., 504024=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 80459=The larpers usually hang out in the upper plaza near the University Center. If you are bored and want to see people fight with fake swords and light sabers, you should check it out. The Student Life and Leadership office use to be the home of the Greeks but they have slowly dwindled away and found different spots to hang out. The Mosaic Office is where all the cool kids hang out so if you are all about diversity and having a chill conversation with chill people, that is the place to go. There is a corner next to the pool tables in the University Center where a group of people always play video games on the TV. If you are huge into video games and want to converse about Halo and Call of Duty, that is the place for you. If you plan to go out and party, most likely you will be heading to the neighborhood directly across the street from campus. It is usually a good time with most of the social people you know. Expect the parties to get shut down around 12:30 or so, unless the host knows how to regulate. If you find yourself hungry after partying it up with your peers late at night, a restaurant called Big Burrito is the place to go! There is nothing like a gigantic breakfast burrito to help you recovery after a long night of partying., 306306=Great dorm rooms with space and private bathrooms. They are currently building new dorms that should be done by fall of 2013., 93646=I have been a student at CTU for almost four years. I graduate with my Bachelor Degree in December 2012. My experience at CTU has been most enjoyable, going back to school has been a great experience for me. It has changed my life. Thank You Colorado Technical University!!, 495286=Get your application in early to be eligible for scholarships. Most scholarships close by March 1st}",
