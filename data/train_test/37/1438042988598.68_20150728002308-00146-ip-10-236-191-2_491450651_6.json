We have here described a preferential solution with some variations therefrom, but other solutions are possible. Thus the proportions and sizes could vary. An upper fixed or balancing limiting means could be provided on the first conveyor belt. The shapes and sizes of the limiting means 20 and 21 could be varied. It is also possible to foresee a different activation system instead of group 34; for example, two coordinated motor groups, instead of one, could be used. It also would be possible to couple up any type of usage means 32 downstream from conveyor belt 19. This system ensures that few cops arrive in reservoir 17 and that they are substantially on the same axis as the compartments. When the control means indicates that the pre-established number of cops 10 per spacer belt has been exceeded or indicates that the volume corresponding with said pre-established number has been exceeded, the spacer belts 47 upstream and the transfer belt 12 are halted. When the number of cops 10 present on a belt is lower than that pre-established, the belts upstream are set in motion again. On belt 247, which is the first one upstream from the reservoir 17, not more than two or three cops (for example) can lie, while not more than eight to ten cops can lie on",
