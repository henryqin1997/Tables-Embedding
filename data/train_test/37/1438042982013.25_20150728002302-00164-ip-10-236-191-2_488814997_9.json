    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes illustrates a flow chart 680 of an exemplary method for constraining substrate 12 during separation of template 18 from substrate 12. In a step 682, substrate 12 may be loaded to system 10. In a step 684, contact head 668 may be placed in contact with substrate 12. For example, surface 670 of contact head 668 may contact chamfered edge 664 of substrate 12. In a step 686, contact head 668 may provide force F constraining substrate 12. In a step 688, base 666 may provide force FC for constraining body 669. In a step 690, the system 10 may perform the imprinting process. In a step 692, contact head 668 may be separated from substrate 12 by radial motion of body 669 about bass 666. In a step 690, substrate 12 may be unloaded from system 10. FIG. 28 As body contacts substrate 12, base 666 may provide an additional force FC to body 669 for constraining substrate 12 during separation as described herein. In one example, body 669 may be adjustably attached to base 666 to provide a constraining force FC about the z-axes. For example, contact head 668 may be coupled to base 666 by a vacuum preloaded air bearing, magnetic preloaded air bearing, and/or the like. . The motion range of the body 669 about base 666 generally is no more than needed for loading",
