He just said that Bumgarner woke up this morning at 7:30AM and he did the same yesterday to get used to time zone and early start.The heat and long inning got to him.TyMo seems different to me since he got picked off last week. Anyone else think so?, 94530=JD said\u2026 Ghost,Good observations re Solano. July 04, 2012 12:42 PM Its truly amazing for a Rookie thrust into this. I want to see him 2 days a week. Just 2. Let's see how he does., 73320=Ghost\u2026\u20262004 here in Central Florida convinced me to invest in a whole house generator., 22297=Is it me or does beer taste different at 11:00 AM?, 96911=NatsJack in Florida said\u2026 Gonat\u2026\u2026I've come to expect the 1st inning stuff from EJax\u2026.3 is about as bad as I can handle and I consider 1 a good first inning. July 04, 2012 12:49 PM JZim was once that way. The Cat had him throw a simulated 1st inning. It certainly cuts your day shorter but it has to be worth trying something different.EJax's Ace game against the Orioles was due to getting thru the 1st quickly and 1-2-3., 1022=Here's something I'm not sure I've ever typed before: Good morning from the ballpark! Yes, we've got an extremely rare starting time today, with first pitch scheduled for 11:05 a.m. The Nats' thinking behind all this: Give fans a chance to attend the game, clear out of town and still have time for a Fourth of July cookout before heading back out for fireworks. (We'll see how that translates into tickets sold, though I suspect it would be a big crowd today regardless of the starting time.), 147276=Gonat said\u2026 Davey went for the knockout punch with Espi instead of busting. Nothing to show for that. July 04, 2012 1:31 PM Its the calculated risk in this game. Bunt them and let Bryce do his thing with men on 2nd and 3rd or play for the big inning.The risk of Espi hitting into a DP was a small risk and it happened.Oh well, get 'em in the 7th., 71081=I didn't know Solano before, I am starting to now. I want to see him more. I see him as a possible 1A. Expect 3 catchers on the Nats roster in September., 1924=SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS at WASHINGTON NATIONALS Where: Nationals Park Gametime: 11:05 a.m. EDT TV: MASN, MLB.tv, MLB Network (outside D.C. market) Radio: WJFK (106.7 FM), WFED (1500 AM), XM 188 Weather: Partly cloudy, 89 degrees, Wind 8 mph LF to RF, 86448=NatsJack in Florida said\u2026 Two years ago in Fall Instructs., Solano was 6th on the depth charts not counting guys like Maldonaldo, or the guys on the 40 man. He's impressed me in all phases but mostly for how he positions himself like Yadier Molina. Observe how low he stays and gives the umpire a clear view of the pitch. July 04, 2012 12:38 PM I like his comfort level with the pitchers. Its a confidence. That's what I really like about Ramos. The HR was a bonus., 129010=phil dunton said\u2026 Harper would have caught that ball in RF. July 04, 2012 1:12 PM Still a tough play although DeRosa was playing plenty deep., 83869=NatsJack in Florida said\u2026 Ghost\u2026\u20262004 here in Central Florida convinced me to invest in a whole house generator. July 04, 2012 12:31 PM I have a portable generator at my main residence and it has multiple outlets. One goes to DirecTV, one to my TV, one to my fridge. On the road, I use cell service to power my MLB.TV and a technology called Slingbox which allows me to watch MASN on my laptop.}",
