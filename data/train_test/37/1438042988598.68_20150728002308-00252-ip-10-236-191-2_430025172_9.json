A former West Indies Under-19 player, Narine made his first-class debut against Leeward Islands but took no wickets in his 13 overs. He had not represented Trinidad and Tobago in any form of limited-overs cricket but was included in the squad for the inaugural Champions League Twenty20 in India in 2009. However, there were doubts raised over his action during the Caribbean T20 in 2011, and he worked with bio-mechanical experts at the University of Western Australia in Perth to change it. The new action was even more effective, as opposition batsmen found out in the Champions League 2011: he was an outstanding success in the tournament, taking ten wickets at an average of 10.50 and an economy rate of 4.37. He made his ODI debut in India as well, on the 2011-12 tour. He hit the jackpot in the 2012 IPL auction, attracting a bid of $700,000 from Kolkata Knight Riders. He made it count, finishing the second-highest wicket-taker with 24 wickets, winning the Man of the Tournament award and spinning Knight Riders to their maiden title win. Test cricket has been a bigger challenge, though and he is still trying to establish himself at Test level. He remains their first-choice spinner in limited-overs cricket.
