The method is entered at step 1002 and proceeds to step 1004 where invoice processing for a first subscriber is initiated. The method 1000 then proceeds to step 1006 where an invoice is initialized with subscriber information such as a name, address, telephone number, account number, group number, etc., 63185=[0059] At step 1008 the method 1000 enters a loop that is repeated for each purchase order (i.e., for each programming event purchased). At step 1010 the method 1000 queries whether other group members purchased the same programming event. If so, the price is adjusted according to a predetermined formula at step 1012. Once the price is determined, or if step 1010 is answered negatively, the method 1000 proceeds to step 1014 where the price is added to the invoice. The method 1000 then returns to step 1008 to repeat the processing for the next purchase order. This loop is repeated until each purchase order has been processed, at which point the method 1000 proceeds to step 1016 to finalize (e.g., total) the bill. At step 1018 the invoice is transmitted to the subscriber (e.g., as an electronic document via the communication network 110)., 64175=[0060] From step 1018 the method 1000 returns to step 1004 where information for the next subscriber is accessed for processing.
