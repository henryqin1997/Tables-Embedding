            "There are plenty of ways to have fun on campus and off campus alike. Performance classes put on free recitals at the end of the semester to showcase the progress of students, and the drama department performs regularly. Basketball games are regularly announced, and the campus museum is open to everyone. There is an abundance of events and activities off campus -- visiting the memorials and museums around the national mall, going to a Nationals game, shopping, going to a movie, attending live performances at one of D.C.'s many theaters, and going out to eat with friends are several of the many things to do for fun.",
            "There is a variety of options from which to choose for food: for a few EagleBucks (money on your school ID) you can buy ingredients or instant meals at the Eagle's Nest, or a sandwich at Subway or Megabytes. Salsa, Tavern, Einstein Bros. Bagels, and the Salad Bar are all located on the first floor of the Mary Graydon Center, and the terrace dining room (TDR) is located on the ground floor. There are four main course stations, two salad bars and a dessert station all of which serve healthy and delicious food. If you get tired of one or the other, there's always the option of going into town to grab a bite.",
            "American University freshmen usually live on south campus in Letts, Roper, Centennial and Anderson halls. Each floor has a communal lounge and a study lounge, and two bathrooms. Most floors are co-ed, but there is are several gender-specific floors. Students living in Roper hall are permitted to live in co-ed rooms. There is a designated RA for each floor to ensure the safety and well-being of his/her residents.",
            "The professors at American University are dedicated to improving and cultivating the abilities of their students. That said, the courses are not particularly easy, as they require students to actively participate during in-class discussions and spend significant time studying material outside of class. Classes tend to be challenging, thus stimulating the growth of knowledge and interest in each field.",
            "Find opportunities to find friends. Become involved in an organization, find a job, go to university-organized events, and hang out in your lounge. There are concerts in the Mary Graydon Center (student union) every few months, and there are plenty of clubs to choose from.",
            "A fifteen-minute metro ride from the center of D.C., American University is a colorful community of curious and intelligent students and professors. This school strongly supports the acceptance of all sexualities and ethnic and social backgrounds, and seriously values diversity as a societal standard. Professors are engaging and enthusiastic, and are genuinely interested in the success of their pupils."

I think it is a good thing because they ensure that the students have the skills necessary to be successful in advanced classes, especially research. I took some college classes in my high school, and most of the classes transferred and were applied towards my degree., 464237=I went to go look at this school in February of 2013 when I was looking at Maryland CP, GWU, and Georgetown. I got on the campus and was immediately unimpressed, the entire campus was grey and drap and the people were less than friendly. Needless to say, I did not apply here., 243934=The dorms can be pretty cramped, especially as the school's popularity grows. But the campus is expanding starting in 2013 to add more dormitories, which will make dorm life more comfortable., 335901=There is one main dining hall - Terrace Dining Hall (better known as TDR) - with the classic stations of salad, grill, pasta/pizza, and wok. In 2013, there should be implemented several other food options, such as Elevation Burger and Starbucks. They will join the ones already on campus such as Einstein Bros. Bagels, Megabytes, Eagle's Nest, and Tavern (got to get the tenders!)., 106669=The capitol is no NYC, but there's rarely a quiet night downtown. There are plenty of clubs and concerts (a popular small venue is The 9:30 club) where well-known bands and DJs come to play. Tuesday nights there are live poetry readings at Busboys and Poets on K street. If you're not one to travel downtown often, there's plenty happening on campus! Sororities have hosted some dance parties in Mary Graydon Center, movies have been shown before they premier in theaters, local metal/alternative bands have played in the basement of the Kay Spiritual Life Center, a zip line was set up down the length of the quad, as well as a petting zoo! The list goes on for miles., 491298=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Kendall from Ridgefield, CT 01/28/2010 Reviewer is A current student here. 24 out of 24 people found this review useful. 2 of 105 Categories Comments Great for these types of students AU is perfect for all types of students that want to be actively involved on campus. I don't know a single person at American that doesn't do at least two extra-curriculars outside of their class load. Tips for prospective students Definitely come visit the campus before making a decision, because that's what sold me on coming here. Especially in the spring you can really see how active students are in and outside the classroom, and how much a college with a campus in a city has to offer. Bang for the buck While the tuition is very high, the quality of things on campus is very good. There are multiple different construction projects going on, but housing is currently a big issue. Many freshman find themselves in triples, and due to limited housing, juniors and seniors are having a harder time getting into",
