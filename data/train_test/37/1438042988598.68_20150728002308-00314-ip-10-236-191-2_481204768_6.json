When the selected condition is a time of 2:30, a segment of the fingerprint reference data corresponding to the scan line data of the numbers 2, 3, 0 is accessed by the card reader 2 and is transmitted to the host computer 3 in the 0-2-3-0 sequence. The host computer 3 compares the segment of the fingerprint reference data with the fingerprint reference data stored in the host computer 3 at the selected time condition. In another example, when the selected condition is a time and a date of 4:33 May 3, 1999, a segment of the fingerprint reference data corresponding to the scan line data of the numbers 0,1, 3, 4, 9, 5 is accessed by the card reader 2 and is transmitted to the host computer 3 in the 1-9-9-9-0-5-0-3-0-4-3-3 sequence. Dynamic changing of the segment of the fingerprint reference data ensures that transaction conducted with the use of the integrated circuit card 1 is valid when a particular condition is met, e.g. 4:33 May 3, 1999. In other words, when unauthorized copying of the card information transmitted by the integrated circuit card 1 at a particular time and date occurred, use of the card information at another time and date will result in an invalid transaction that will be rejected by the host computer 3.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the present invention has been described in connection with what is considered the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is understood that this invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiment but is intended to cover various arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent arrangements. 3. Since the integrated circuit card 1 can be used as a bank card, an identification card or a credit card, the user only needs to bring along one card to accomplish different tasks, thereby resulting in added convenience. 2. The card information exchanged with the host computer 3 can vary dynamically since the integrated circuit card 1 further transmits a segment of the fingerprint reference data that is selected according to time and date conditions, thereby further enhancing security when making network transactions. 1. Since the integrated circuit card 1 compares fingerprint scan data obtained by scanning a fingerprint of a holder of the card 1 with the fingerprint reference data in the memory device 11 to verify if the holder is the assigned user, the integrated circuit card 1 can only be used by the assigned user so as to reduce the risks involved when the integrated circuit card 1 is stolen or misplaced.
