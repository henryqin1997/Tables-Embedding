If you are between sizes or need assistance selecting the proper size, please contact Customer Service Designer Shoshanna Lonstein Gruss launched her collection in 1998 because she was unable to find wearable, beautiful clothes for her body type. \"I could never find a halter dress or strapless top that offered support for women who usually need to wear a bra,\" she says. Shoshanna Swimwear followed in 2001, and gave women with curves a new outlook on buying a bikini. Sold as separates, Shoshanna Swimwear features tops and bottoms that offer support without sacrificing the sexiness every bikini should embody.
