The scope of the invention is therefore not intended to be limited by the specific embodiments disclosed herein, but is intended to be defined by the full scope of the following claims. [0084] Any of the embodiments disclosed herein may additionally be provided with one or more externally facing electrically conductive axially extending strips or annular bands, to enable the device 40 to function additionally as a cardiac pacing or other cardiac electrode. The electrically conductive band or bands are placed in electrical communication with a pacing source or diagnostic instrument by way of one or more electrical conductors extending away from the device 40. The conductors may be electrically connected to any of a wide variety of electronic cardiac rhythm management devices, which are well known in the art. [0083] In accordance with further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of constricting the left ventricle. Left ventricular constriction may be desirable in patients without mitral regurgitation. One implementation of this method comprises implanting the ventricular girdle 100 as illustrated, for example, in FIGS. 5 through 6 and previously discussed herein. [0082]",
