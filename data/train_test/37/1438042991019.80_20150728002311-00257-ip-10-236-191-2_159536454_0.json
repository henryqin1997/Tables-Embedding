After Michigan brought in three SDE-types in 2012\u2014Matt Godin, Tom Strobel, and Chris Wormley\u2014there wasn't a major need, especially with in-state standout Malik McDowell firmly in their sights for the 2014 class., 5616=It's distinctly possible that no member of the 2013 class starts on defense next season, and that's a very good thing for Michigan. If one will, however, it's safety Dymonte Thomas, a dominant force in the state of Ohio at both running back and safety for the last three seasons. Michigan has to replace Jordan Kovacs, and if Jarrod Wilson isn't ready to step in at free safety, it's likely that Thomas Gordon will play there while Thomas slides in at strong safety., 41080=2014 Offer List BOYCOTT ADIDAS, 37387=As for our depth we could have 8 guys playing 1 and 3 tech, or we more likely could have fewer. Black could stay at 3 tech, or he could take over the starting SDE job Roh left open since he'd be the best SDE we have, and rotate in at 3 tech as needed, like he did rotating spots last year. Wormley is coming off an ACL injury, and could be ready in Spring ball, or he might not be 100% or game ready in September. Wilkins has never played, and Ash's ceiling might be third string.\u00a0Godin is 6'6\" and under 280, so he could play 3 tech, but he might be stuck at SDE for another year, while Hurst is only a year younger, but he's 300+, explosive, highly \u00a0athletic, and while he does play high at times, at 6'2\" it's probably not a big issue because he uses his hands so well, and he could be a better option than Godin, Wilkins, or Ash next year inside., 4492=The lone linebacker spot the 2012 class didn't cover was on the strong side, and McCray's size (6'4\", 230 lbs.) and athleticism make him an ideal fit there. Gedeon, meanwhile, is a stellar athlete\u2014he also starred at running back for Hudson\u2014who should be able to cover the field sideline-to-sideline from the weakside linebacker position., 125595=Thomas, Hill and Ross (as nickel) seem like the 3 with enough mass to play right now. The other three are 15 lbs below playing weight. The 3 guys might add lbs by Aug and play, but even if they don't they are high ceiling guys and saving all 4 yrs with a RS might be serendipity., 36544=I'm not saying our need is dire, i'm saying it could happen. I suppose the coaches didn't really need to burn Peewee's last year, or potentially Wormleys until he got hurt, either. Since they were ready to burn two DT's redshirts last year I'm surprised everybody things this is totally crazy. Heck, they threw half our freshman class at Alabama first game of the season last year. They like to rotate a lot of guys in on the line, and in different looks, and use different guys in different games. You could also look back at the 2012 UFRs and see that we regularly had DT's sitting games out last year for one reason or an other. Also the coaches keep stating that play time is won, and they put the best 11or so out there, so he could be a better DT option than half those guys, despite his youth, once in a while., 78120=Jabreel played 3-tech with a 279 listed weight and was light. Frank has gained 57 pounds in 2.5 years so he could certainly break 280 before August. Underlying point: that's probably too large for WDE., 29900=Twitter\u00a0- 2015 Countdown: #33 Ty Isaac}",

    "textAfterTable": "And now, some superlatives: BEST POSITION GROUP:\u00a0Linebacker This class is pretty evenly spread across the position groups\u2014an argument could be made for pretty much any group on the field. In an effort to avoid giving all of the awards to Dymonte Thomas, I'll go with the linebackers here. After 2012's big haul, Michigan only needed a couple of linebackers in the class, and they filled their two spots with a pair of very solid prospects in Mike McCray and Ben Gedeon. The lone linebacker spot the 2012 class didn't cover was on the strong side, and McCray's size (6'4\", 230 lbs.) and athleticism make him an ideal fit there. Gedeon, meanwhile, is a stellar athlete\u2014he also starred at running back for Hudson\u2014who should be able to cover the field sideline-to-sideline from the weakside linebacker position.
