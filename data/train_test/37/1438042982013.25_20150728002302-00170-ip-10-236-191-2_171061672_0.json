            "We will travel to a dark location and stay up all night through the next morning to catch the peak of the Geminid Meteor Shower, the grand finale of the 2015 meteor showers.",
            "Targeted to adults of any age with a interest in learning more about astronomy, we will cover the basics of getting started in this field.",
            "Join entomologist Dr. Colin Brammer in the lab as we examine live and preserved specimens using dissecting scopes, field guides and magnifying glasses.",
