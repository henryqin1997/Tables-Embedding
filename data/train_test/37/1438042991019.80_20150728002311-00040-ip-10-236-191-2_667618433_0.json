If a vessel is not compliant, appropriate action is taken to eliminate any threat that vessels may pose to U.S. waters, ports, and citizens. Examples of threats can include: oil leaks, improper repairs to lifeboats, inability to demonstrate proficiency in a fire drill, or failure to maintain document control.
