            "Memoria2 - #62 Someone exists as a black hole in Lucas\u2019s memory and heart\u2026 All he can do is make sure events don\u2019t repeat themselves, but that\u2019s not much consolation.",
            "Memoria2 - #61 I can curse destiny all I want, but I can\u2019t change anything that happened. Now I just wish that the dark dragon, the being who\u2026 changed the world, would let go of me\u2026 Just let go\u2026",
            "Memoria2 - #60 I have this dream sometimes\u2026 I feel awake, looking out into a surreal and twisted world. My mother, in the distance, always silent, always out of reach. My brother, too close, with words but not himself. I try to forget. Or just accept. And now I can\u2019t even remember their faces\u2026 They\u2019re just blurs, not the things I remember. The detail has gone out of them. Red hair, striped shirt, brown hair, red dress, that\u2019s all I truly remember\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to cling to anymore.",

            "Memoria2 - #59 Lucas is such a nice guy who hates to see anyone sad or angry. But his inner-self is pretty banged up, his psyche scarred. As he slips off into the world of dreams, you\u2019re about to get a sampling of what torments him\u2026"
