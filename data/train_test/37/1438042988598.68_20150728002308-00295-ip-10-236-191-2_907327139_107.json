            "IUP is affordable, and you're getting the same education as though who would pay double or triple what you're paying for schooling.",
            "IUP is known for it's 'night life' among the students, and we certainly know how to party. Partying isn't everything, though: we offer many different intramural and varsity sports for the athletes, as well as clubs and groups for others.",
            "IUP offers many different places to dine with your friends and classmates. Foster is a cafeteria-style dining area with variety of homestyle options, while Folger is a combination of more restaurant style chains, such as Quiznos and Starbucks.",
            "The dorms at IUP are beautiful, but you also pay for the beauty. They offer many different kinds of 'suites' in the newly-built dorm buildings, and there really is something for everyone.",
            "The expectation at IUP may not be as difficult as Harvard or Princeton, but it's still demanding, and you have to study and go to class to do well.",
            "Study and attend class. Attendance is not mandatory for all classes, but it is definitely recommended. If you miss class all the time for partying and drinking, you'll fall behind.",
            "IUP is a great school. It's large enough where there is a diverse group of students, but small enough where the average individual won't be overwhelmed. It's also affordable, much more so than most PA colleges."

That said, you may have to take out loans if you do not get sufficient financial aid (this happens especially if you live in on-campus housing). My loans have averaged $1000 per semester. Also, the quality of education will depend on the department/major you are in. The Education department and Nursing programs have notable and excellent programs, while some others are very lacking in terms of instructor quality and rigor., 700862=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 10966=Expect cold weather in October, but mostly expect amazing unity. The IUP campus is big and holds 14,000 students, but you feel so involved when you are here. Whether you join the paper or just play frisbee with friends in the Oak Grove, you will see how unified the students are.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Campus Safety IUP is a very safe and secure campus. The dorm building lock after 8pm every day. Each wing of the dorm building is always locked. Your dorm room door locks and so does your bedroom door. Your bedroom windows lock and will not open more than 6 inches as a safety precaution. The police are always around and there are emergency buttons located around campus. If you press that button the police will be there within 2 minutes. It's very safe. Greek Life There are tons of opportunities to go Greek at IUP. There are honor, religious, themed, and just fun fraternities and sororities to join. Don't miss out! Clubs and Activities There are infinite clubs and activites you could join. There are all kinds of religious groups, anime club, sports teams, residence hall association, everything! There's even video games club. Great for these types of students Great for all types of students, especially education majors! Bang for the buck It's cheap compared to other schools in Pennsylvania. What to do for fun You could go hang out",
