            "Be open to the Hawaiian culture and you will be recieved with open arms. Most people are friendly and laidback. It is a completely different vibe from anywhere I've been in the United States.",
            "If you are coming from out of state, be prepared. It can get very expensive.",
            "Hawaii is beautiful. While the campus is a bit rundown, the surrounding area is gorgeous, and the beach is just a 10 minute bus ride away! Manoa can be rainy, so bring an umbrella.",
            "I am a marine biology major and I am learning a lot about things I never knew before. Biology and chemistry labs offer a lot of hands on experience, and there are many opportunities for fieldwork and internships."

Also you must enjoy the sunshine and warm weather year-round. This is also a great place for students who wants to learn many different languages because UH offers many different foreign languages that you probably wouldnt be able to learn at a college on the mainland. Tips for prospective students Be ready for a different demographic of students with many students of Asian and Pacific Islander decent.
