            "Derivatives of CGRP - Acylated CGRP compounds with a linker have prolonged action and are valuable as medicaments.",
            "NOVEL GLUCAGON ANALOGUES - The present invention relates to novel peptide compounds which have a protracted profile of action and improved solubility and stability, to the use of the compounds in therapy, to methods of treatment comprising administration of the compounds to patients in need thereof, and to the use of the compounds in the manufacture of medicaments. The compounds of the invention are of particular interest in relation to the treatment of hyperglycemia, diabetes and obesity, as well as a variety of diseases or conditions associated with hyperglycemia, diabetes and obesity.",
            "Long-Acting Gastrin Derivatives - The present invention relates to gastrin derivatives comprising gastrin or an analogue or fragment thereof and a derivatisation group and therapeutic use thereof.",
            "LONG-ACTING Y2 RECEPTOR AGONISTS - The present invention relates to PYY derivatives comprising a serum albumin binding side chain, wherein said derivative has a half-life of at least 7 hours as determined by Assay (IV) described herein as well as compositions comprising said derivative and its use in therapy.",
            "Double-Acylated GLP-1 Derivatives - The invention relates to a derivative of a GLP-1 analogue, which analogue comprises a first K residue at a position corresponding to position 18 of GLP-1 (7-37) (SEQ ID NO: 1), a second K residue at another position, and a maximum of twelve amino acid changes as compared to GLP-1 (7-37); which derivative comprises two protracting moieties attached to said first and second K residue, respectively, via a linker, wherein the protracting moiety is selected from Chem. 1, Chem. 2, and Chem. 3: Chem.: HOOC\u2014(CH",
