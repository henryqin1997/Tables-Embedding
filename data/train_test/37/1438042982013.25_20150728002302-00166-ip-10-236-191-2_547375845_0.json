One way in which they make a difference is through the Angel Tree, a large Christmas tree that stands in the entrance of the church from Thanksgiving until the middle of December. Every year, approximately 1,000 tags are placed on the branches of the tree. The tags have a child\u2019s age and gender and what they want for Christmas. Parishioners take as many tags off the tree as they like and purchase the appropriate gift. Cathy Kohlrust, Youth Ministry assistant director, has been the Angel Tree organizer since 2006., 25424=ALBUQUERQUE (AP) \u2014 It was a year of extremes for New Mexico, with dramatic weather dominating the headlines from start to finish in 2011., 19479=Win or lose, the Los Alamos Hilltopper teams are usually fun to watch and 2011 was no exception., 28684=The ups and downs for the CMRR facility grabbed headlines once again in 2011., 30048=Together, Tucker and Torpy made every major decision during the fire from when to order the mandatory evacuation of June 27 to the repopulation of July 3 and countless more in between., 40917=Copyright \u00a9 2015}",
