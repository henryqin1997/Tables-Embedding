The proclamation \u2013 which kicked off the 75th anniversary of dairy farmers and their promotional organization, Denver-based Western Dairy Association (WDA) \u2013 recognized 180 dairy farms and 220 dairy farm families in Colorado, Wyoming and Montana for working together to promote their products and provide consumers each year with more than 3.2 billion pounds of milk. More than 420 dairy farm families and business leaders gathered June 13 at INVESCO Field at Mile High Stadium to benchmark the milestone and farmer contributions to food supply, economic growth, and nutrition, health and wellness education. \u201cDairy farm families celebrate 75 years of working together to supply our state\u2019s consumers and communities with an abundant supply of fresh, locally produced milk and dairy products,\u201d he said, referencing the proclamation. \u201cTheir innovative dairy farming practices ensure that they maintain an environmentally and socially sustainable way of life for this and future generations.\u201d, 7218=In 1936, dairy farm families formed and invested in the activities of the Denver Dairy Council. Its mission was to educate consumers about milk\u2019s value in a balanced diet. Over the years, the organization has expanded its reach to include Montana and Wyoming dairy farmers and has modified its structure, names and programs to meet the needs of the marketplace., 6545=06.21.2011, 8835=He also credited U.S. Dairy Export Council (USDEC), a non-profit organization founded by farmers in 1995 and jointly financed by farmers and 100 member organizations with export trade interests, for advancing milk sales through global channels. Since its inception, total dairy product exports have increased from 2 percent to 14 percent of total U.S. milk production., 11185=In addition to contributing to the fresh food supply and state and local economies, since 1936 dairy farmers have collaborated through WDA and its predecessor organizations to advance nutrition education and teach consumers about the nutrient-rich values of milk and dairy products in a healthy, fit lifestyle.}",
