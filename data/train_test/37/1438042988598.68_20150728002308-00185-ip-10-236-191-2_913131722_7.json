            "dorm life here is above adequate, and it is in a great city. you are bound to have fun.",
            "the classes are difficult, but because the school is so small, professors are able to provide a great deal of personal guidance and assitance.",
            "spend some time on campus before comitting to loyola. there is a certain and unmistakable environment on this campus that may not be suitable for everyone. there is no doubt, however, that the education you receive here will leave you prepared for the next step.",
            "loyola has a gorgeous campus,, and is in a quiet, diverse area of a great city. being a relatively expensive, private institution, however, means that the make-up of the university is not nearly as diverse. the small size and great reputation will ensure that you receive an extremely personal and through education."

The best place to eat is (currently) Simpson Dining. I would advise not eating at Lakeshore Dining, except come April we won't even have Lakeshore Dining. They are opening up a brand new student center where I'm sure there will be exceptional food., 690229=Well there are the rocks by the lake that everyone loves, and the beach on warmer days to just sit and relax. An unusual tradition would be christmas on campus or the new years party that is held almost every year. The christmas on campus is self explanatory, you basically have christmas on campus! It's wonderful because everything is decorated! The new years party is in early september and its a small celebration for all the students and staff to welcome the new academic school and wish everyone good luck in their endeavors!, 801808=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 102840=Wolf and Kettle day is in March every year when we celebrate the donors of our education and those who help pay for tuition. FUN, 18578=Do not take a class at 8:30 offered at the Water Tower Campus!One of the classes I would highly recommend is Human Values in Literature with Mr. Fruhauff. Overall, try to have an open mind about courses and balance out your schedule so that it fits your needs. Do not try to do too much in one semester but do try to get involved in extra curriculars. You will not regret it.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students This school is PERFECT for nursing students! Loyola's nursing program is in the 95th percentile for the NCLEX. Tips for prospective students Apply as soon as you possibly can if you think you might want to go to Loyola, this will help you get the most aid since scholarships are on a first come, first serve basis. Also, if you plan to attempt to get into the nursing program spots fill up quickly, so the sooner you apply the better. But you should keep one thought in mind academically, it is easy to get into Loyola but hard to stay. Loyola will continuously challenge you in order to bring out your best, however it will not be easy! Bang for the buck I believe that Loyola is worth going to regardless of cost because of the outstanding faculty and program for nursing. However, it is still very costly to attend. Although it will not be easy for me to find a way to pay tuition, I am willing to do everything in my power in order to be able to stay at such a wonderful school. If at all possible, I plan to enroll in Loyola's graduate school for a master's degree in nursing. Am enjoying being here",
