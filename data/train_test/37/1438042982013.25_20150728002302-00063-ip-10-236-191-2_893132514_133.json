You also must be able to manage your time because no one else will do this for you. Being a science student I would suggest looking at the school if you are interested in the science or business area. Tips for prospective students The amount you learn in a class depends on many different factors. In the first year you really have to learn how to juggle a whole new array of things that can become quite overwhelming. OSU offers some helpful classes on time juggling, study sessions, and other recourses which should be taken advantage of. Teachers can also play a large role in how much you learn throughout your college experience. Check out www.ratemyprofessors.com for some reviews by people who have already taken the class so you know what to expect. Bang for",
