    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{89160=What salary cap?I'm so glad that we didn't sacrifice our defense and future stability for PF.The guy is a great hitter and a lower tier first baseman. 9 years would have been a noose around our necks.Now, I won't diss his defense anymore. I wish him, and the Tigers luck. I'm glad we don't have to face him very often until we meet them in the World Series in 2013. I only have one more thing to say: GYFNG!!!, 27053=It's meaningful that so many Nats fans are relieved not to get Prince Fielder. I'm one of them. It's not just the money, it's the impact that he would've had on the roster by occupying 1B for a generation, adversely affecting the team's relationships with Zimmerman, Morse, Rendon, and even Espinosa and Desmond. We like those players and want to win with them in the long run, even if it means being less likely to contend in 2012. No Bowden team had that kind of character., 126807=Mark Z and Mike Rizzo, thanks for being grown-ups.For Xmas, we kids sometimes want toys that are way too expensive and way too breakable. Now\u2026Agree totally with natscan reduxit: \u2026 okay, so now here's what I wonder. The Nats need a run producer to top up the lineup. Anyone have any ideas who might be a good fit right now and available?Without a lot of luck, natural progression in 2012 is not going to improve our offense enough.Make a deal Rizzo., 53376=Okay, I'm Rizzo:I trade Desmond & Roger Bernadina to the Rays for Upton and a low-level minor leaguer. I put him in center and assume he'll produce something like a .260-24-80 line. Maybe the team resigns him, maybe not. Espinosa moves over to short and second becomes Lombardozzi's (who won the only Gold Glove for second base in all the minors last year) with Mark DeRosa available behind him if Lombardozzi's bat isn't ready. Add Eric Hinske, resign Rick Ankiel as the 4th outfielder, and here is my projected lineup with stats (and I haven't been wrong since last year):2B\u2013Lombardozzi: .270-4-50, 30 steals (or DeRosa)CF\u2013Upton: .260-24-70, 20 steals3B\u2013Zimmerman: .285-25-100LF\u2013Morse: .280-25-901B\u2013LaRoche: .270-24-85RF\u2013Werth: .265-23-75, 20 stealsSS\u2013Espinosa: .250-23-70, 20 stealsC\u2013Ramos: .275-17-60That lineup has a bunch of good but not great hitters, but there combined production would be more than enough for the upgraded rotation.That's an 86-91 win team., 36028=jd said\u2026Wally, I think we are looking at a Bernadina and Cameron platoon in center for 2012. Let's see if Goodwin is the real deal or if we have to find a CF elsewhere.Hey JD, how are things?You are almost certainly right, but that just seems so disappointing and unnecessary. For relatively little money, we could have added an Andruw Jones, Cody Ross or several others who could have, at a minimum, been part of an effective platoon. I think that we know what Bernie is (and it isn't someone who should get more than 100 ABs a year), and I find it hard to believe that Cameron will be productive at his age and after the last few years.OK, I'll stop whining now., 80316=anon 4:28, i think if they wait for next offseason to try and resign zimmerman (one n) next offseason, they will likely either (a) find a much bigger price tag or (b) find an unreceptive player who wants to test FA. i think i've read somewhere that his people have said he's unlikely to sign an extension after this offseason, but i could be misremembering that., 100694=Programming note: First Baseball Tonite on Feb 7 at 3:30, 94038=To all above who marveled at Boras' skills \u2014 I have to think he found a way to pay off God or something, because the only reason he could get this deal was a combination of NatsJack at 3:38 and the Fox at 4:37. The only way he could get more than 5 or 6 years tops was with an AL team, and after the Rangers fell out of doing that kind of contract, no way would PF go to a non-contender.So of course VMart busts his knee and the contending AL Tigers fall into Boras' lap. How can someone so rich get that kind of pure luck you just can't buy?, 77591=To the anonymous at 4:18. We can all start getting used to the idea that Strasburg, Harper and the rest of the Boras clients will leave town when they hit FA. It comes with the territory. A BIG reason why you don't bring Harper up from Spring Training in order to keep him an extra year!, 70072=\"I know we want to stay positive, but we still lost out.\"True. I'm disappointed but the disappointment is tempered by the knowledge that the price was, as you put it, \"prohibitive.\"I'm a fan and I am tired of losing baseball. (I grew up a Mets fan in a Yankee hotbed, Northern New Jersey.) But I'm also keenly aware that free agency is usually a suckers' deal: the \"winning\" team is paying for at least some of the player's decline years based on his peak-year performance. MLB's \"Clubhouse Confidential\" had segment on the $100 million pitchers. The best deal was arguably CC Sabathia, which says a lot to me about how ridiculous paying a pitcher that much money is. Even the Yankees are about to find out how much long-term big money deals can tie your hands. Even if they were willing to pay the 40% luxury tax, their commitments to Texiera, ARod, Jeter, Sabathia et al, are limiting their options. hands. The only way they get under the threshold is by hoping that two of their 2014 starters are players earning the MLB minimum or letting Robinson Cano walk.I'm still disappointed but mostly that Boras found someone who would meet his demands, not that the Nationals weren't willing to marry Prince Fielder., 72651=Maybe Ilitch wants to win several more times before he leaves this mortal coil and bequeaths the aging PF blimp circa 2021 to his heirs to sort out? Even billionaires can't take it with them, and what's the point in having it if you're not willing to spend some of it to make yourself happy? He might not be as interested in \"building for the future\" with all the uncertainty that entails as some\u2026, 31088=Wally,I think we are looking at a Bernadina and Cameron platoon in center for 2012. Let's see if Goodwin is the real deal or if we have to find a CF elsewhere., 127890=Im saddened by the love fest\u2026of a move that didnt happen.Personally, I'm pissed Prince is not a Nat.I'll say this:Prince is not a good defensive 1B. But he hits 35+ homers and has an OBP of 400+. His OPS+ for his 7 year career is 140+. Thats a hall of famer barring injury. Sure, he weighs almost 300 lbs, but he also has played almost a full season every year and he's only 27. At what point would his long term deal have become an issue? Age 34 after multiple playoff appearances? When is $23+ mil/yr a detriment to a mid+ market payroll? After the first playoff series? The second? How about after the first World Series Title?How Much Is A Championship Worth?I'm not sure, though I know I would be there from the day Prince would have been introduced as the Nats 1B for the next decade.My issue isnt what just happened\u2026its what hasnt happened.Why arent other fans up in arms WAS has Werth and LaRoche instead of Prince (Or AGon or Pujols\u2026) and any other miscellaneous outfielder?I understand signing Prince could have jeapordized signing Zim and others long term (though it shoudnt have)! But signing PF would have infused WAS with an energy not seen since the mid 80's Redskins.And I'm a Zimmerman superfan. I love the future of Zim, Zimm, Espinosa, Ramos, Stras, Storen and Gio. I love the potential of Harper and Rendon, never mind the other prospects that make it through. The Nats have a bright future.Signing Fielder shouldnt have been an issue to immediately re-signing Zimmerman or extending other designated players as they became free agent eligble. The DC market supports a much higher team salary based on Forbes projections along with increased MASN revenue.Ive had the KOOL AID since 2005. You'll see me in the same seats since inception. I love rooting for drafted guys and trading them for players like Gio. But when do you say management F'd up and didn't use their funds appropriately?No Pujols, Fielder, Gonzalez, etc at 1B. Werth is at RF though almost comparable (and older) players like Cuddyer and Beltran sign for multiple tens of millions less. I understand signing Werth made a statement. But do you need to pay $75 milllion more than necessary to do so while losing out on 4 potential hall of fame 1B? Foresight is 20/20\u2026Werth & LaRoche or Fielder & Cuddyer?The Nats have the cash to afford 3 $20+ contracts per year AND renew other arb players as they come due in the future. While the Nats continue to pay down their debt service instead of wisely investing in players, their ability to profit through their MASN deal dwindles.Mike Illitch (DET owner) is a winner. He will lose money to win. He will lose money to support his city. Maybe its because his GM convinces him to do so, like Dombrowski did with Huizenga for FLA. Regardless, we do not have that in DC.We have owners who chose to pay debt service instead of player salaries. Forbes magazine has described the Nats as the most profitable team in baseball. Why can DET afford/rationalize Prince over 9 years but not the Nats?Why can a recession DET team afford 3 $20 mil plus players or a PHI afford 3 $20 mil plus players over the next 5 years but its not possible for the Nats? Pardon me while my post is disjointed. Its off the cuff and been awhile since I last posted., 92588=This is one of those Long Term vs. Short Term deals. In the ST we may wish we had PF but in the LT (I believe) we will be glad that Detroit got him for the DH. Time will tell as he will probably have some very good years in 2012-14.We hopefully will be wildcard or better this year and contend for division championships and WS championships over the next 2-5+ years. Not having $214M tied up with one player that based on his fathers stats will probably be declining in 3-4 years will give us more flexibility when we need it most. We should continue to be a model franchise that rewards its own key players (and internally developed players) with LT contracts. Note how poorly the Skins have done that recently and how well the Csps have done that. Lets get RZ signed before ST so that issue can be put to rest!!!, 125774=I almost feel like I'm not on the Internet, all these comments are so well thought out and intelligent, and not a mean spirited word between anybody. No one has claimed that Obama's a socialist or that Gingrich is the devil, I mean damn, I love TRUE Nats fans. I've rooted for the Nats since 1958-1971 and again since they came back, this is going to be the greatest season of my lifetime. Let's do it., 158211=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC. Images provided by Getty Images. Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 44547=Let's see what Rendon does in the minors, but I am hoping he plays a significant role, at least by 2013. My preference is 2nd base with Espinosa at short and Desmond in a super utility role., 145688=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows. Here's the 2015 schedule (subject to change)... MON: 12:45 p.m. TUE: 2:30 p.m. WED: 4:30 p.m. THU: 2:30 p.m. FRI: 5:30 p.m. SAT: 10:30 a.m. *All times Eastern.

Natslady, I should never have doubted your read on Detroit.I still think that the deal, from Detroit's perspective, is nuts. Yes, they fill in for VMart this year while he's out. But VMart is still under contract for the two seasons after that. On Opening Day 2013, VMart is at DH, Miggy at 1b, and Prince \u2026 is playing OF? Miggy was an unqualified disaster at 3b, and VMart was a disaster at catcher. If the Tigers start Miggy at 3b and Prince at 1b they may have the worst infield defense in ML history. They will essentially be paying $53 million a year for three designated hitters in 2013 and 2014. Wowsers. I still think it's crazy, but I'm glad that Rizzo and the Lerners walked away instead of doubling down on the dumb., 59031=I am glad Rizzo stuck with his words that AL is his opening day 1B. Hoping to see Morse at 1B in 2013 and Harper in LF, while we add a CF through FA.}",
