            "Tuition at SUNY ESF is a third of those paying at Syracuse University, yet we are still able to reap most of the benefits. It has a small school feeling yet has all the amenities of a large school.",
            "The Westcott Theatre is within walking distance of the university. If live bands aren't your thing there are always fraternity parties, bars on Marshall street, or clubs downtown.",
            "Just recently got our own student center with a cafe in it - Trailhead Cafe. Otherwise Syracuse University offers meal plans for SUNY students. The dining halls are always available and offer a wide selection of food.",
            "The school just recently built dorms for the SUNY ESF students. We had previously been placed in Syracuse University dorms.",
            "The classes are intended to be challenging so that SUNY ESF graduates excel in real world situations. The school has pushed me to work hard more than I ever received in any other institution.",
            "Prepare for the cold winters.",
            "The small scale of the school allows you to get to know your professors personally. They are always willing and available to meet if you are not understanding the course material. I am hardly ever in a lecture room with more than 30 students."

They are extremely nice, better than any of the SU dorms! There are 2 people per room in the freshman wing, and each room is very spacious with its own bathroom, fridge, and microwave. The lounges and basement are all very popular places to hang out, and the atmosphere in general is just awesome. It's such a fun place to hang out with you friends, and it's really cool because your entire freshman class is in the same building. The other wing of the building consists of suites for upperclassmen, although freshmen are only required to live on campus the first year, but the suites are really nice!, 14755=Up until Fall 2011, we lived in Syracuse's dorms all around their campus pretty much. This year we have brand new dorms, which are semi-nice (yet they built them in less than a year so there are many defects to the building). I would suggest if you are transferring in to opt to live off campus and check orangehousing.com for roommate classifieds or google the daily orange and look under the classifieds. The dorms are VERY strict, the Ra's live to get students in trouble if they even hear the slightest noise after quiet hours, even just normal talking, they will knock on your door and give you a warning/write you up. The dorms are also located VERY far away from anywhere (other than class) you need to go. It is inconveniently located downhill/downstairs from anywhere you will want to go, making it a pain to walk or bike anywhere. (Most) The freshman live in doubles, with their own bathrooms, and are all located in one 'wing' of the building. Upperclassman live in another wing and have their own bedrooms, connected to one other persons room by a common room and bathroom. There are also apartments in the building, which have kitchens, four (singles) bedrooms, full-sized beds, and two bathrooms. They come with a couch and a chair, dining table with dining chairs, and a coffee table. The freshman seem to all know each other because they all interact but the upperclassman side is sheltered away and don't really interact much unless you already know each other., 62229=Be prepared to see a lot of people without shoes on even in the dead of winter. In April we don't have Earth Day, we have Earth Week and its a blast! The Gateway building is brand new, has a green roof, is environmentally friendly and is home to the Trailhead Cafe.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students outdoorsy, hard workers, passion for the environment Tips for prospective students Be ready to hit the ground running, it will be a lot more work than you're used to in high school, but definitely worth it. It has a partnership and is right across the street from SU, on of the biggest party schools in the country, so don't get too wrapped up in all the parties. Time management will be your biggest obstacle to overcome. There will always be something to do, especially if you're living in the dorms (Centennial), but in order to get a good GPA you will need to spend a lot of time doing homework and studying. A lot of students create study groups so you get work done and have a social life at the same time. Also, GET SLEEP! With everything that's going on, sleep can sometimes get lost in the mix, but without sleep you are more likely to doze off in class which does not leave a good impression on the professors and you will be more likely to get sick. Have fun in college too! Join clubs that you're interested in and GET INVOLVED! Also, don't be afraid to go to your professors for help. Utilize their office hours, not only will they help you and answer any questions they have, but it will",
