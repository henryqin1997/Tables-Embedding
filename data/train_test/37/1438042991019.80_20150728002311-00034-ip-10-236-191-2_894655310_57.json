            "This college offers a variety of well organized programs. Puente, for example, is a great program on campus that offers the knowledge of why it is important to transfer to a four year university, and to prepare you to become a successful individual, and student. The Honors program is an excellent program also offered on campus",
            "I could honestly say that all students should be prepared for the courses. Each course is going to be time consuming,however, make time for your studies,and your loved ones. Not only do some courses have many assignments, but",

Compared to a university, it is very cheap. There is also a board of governors wavier that one could apply for in order to have their classes paid for. One just has to show that they financially struggling., 30491=I would check out some other junior colleges in the area as well. Like Palomar or RCC. MSJC is a good school, its just really impacted and hard to get into classes. It would probably be a good idea to register for classes at a couple different places if you can, or just be okay with the fact that an AA/AS could take you 3 - 5 years., 159767=Class units cost $48 as of Oct. 2012. Way more affordable than starting off at a University. Pay close attention to which units transfer and which don't., 117121=As of now they are asking i believe $36 a unit which is just over $100 a class which is a whole lot cheaper for your general education then if you were going to a Four-year institution paying almost a $1000 or more per class. I say your going to get more band for your buck here then at a Four-year, 277808=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 104405=Units will increase beginning Fall 2012 to $49 a unit}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students This school is great for any type of student, but is best for students who do not have a lot of money and are looking for a top-notch education. Even top students in high school will learn as much at this school as if they went to a 4 year university. Tips for prospective students Buy the books from somewhere online or from other students. I paid for all my books new and they were all over $60. Bang for the buck The tuition is extremely cheap. I LOVE how cheap it is. Compared to other schools, going to Mount San Jacinto is like going to school for free, which in this economy is mind blowing! The cafe is also very cheap but it serves delicious food. Am enjoying being here The faculty is extremely nice and open with the student population and even the students are friendly and open-minded. I love being close to the mountain even though the weather can sometimes be hot, but the campus is small and it is very easy to locate classes. Am learning a lot Ever since I first",
