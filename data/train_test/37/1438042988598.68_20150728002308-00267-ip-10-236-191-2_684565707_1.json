            "Located twenty miles northeast of Snyder, Texas, in the canyonland between Little Rough Creek and Goldstens Branch near the Double Mountain Fork of the Brazos River in the northeastern corner of Scurry County. It developed as a farming and ranching community perhaps as early as the 1890s. By 1901 a post office was created and James B. Hudnall, for whom the community was named, served as the first postmaster. J. D. [Buddy] Hudnall (born 1916) told an interviewer that his mother operated a store at their home beginning about 1908 and that a post office called Hud was in the store. Hudnall remembered that their neighbors came to the store to collect mail and that later the store had a gas station. Children from Hud community in the years Hudnall was a student [1923-1930] attended Cottonwood School, about three miles away and located south of Little Rough Creek. From the taking of the 1920 federal census through 1929 Hud community claimed a population of fifteen. In the 1930s Scurry County, like most of the nation, was hit by economic depression. The Hudnall store closed in 1931 and the post office closed by 1934, leaving the community without a focus. The name of the community continued to be shown on state highway maps as late as 1986.
