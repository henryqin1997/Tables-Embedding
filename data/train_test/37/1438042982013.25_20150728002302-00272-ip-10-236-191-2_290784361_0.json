Samsung's Galaxy S4 with Touchwiz shoots at 4128 by 2322 to fill up the whole screen. The Google Play edition Galaxy S4 shoots at 4128 by 3096. The Google Play edition had a much harder time focusing on the Cheerios., 90527=The original Motorola Droid 1 was vanilla android and had an SD card that worked fine. Google music app was updated on it all the way through 2012 and still read all my music on my SD card til the phone broke at the end of last year., 19479=Neither, of course, is a \u201cstock\u201d Android experience. We\u2019ve been using Android 4.2 since it was released with the Nexus 4 in November 2012, and the most up-to-date version -- Android 4.2.2, since February. We know \u201cstock\u201d Android., 285057=It's popping up in a lot of cities while they ramp up and test. It's not officially \"on\" in any area except their initial 7 cities that they announced in March though. There's a couple of towers here with it, but that's not nearly enough to be considered \"on\" in my book., 307249=Did anybody noticed the difference in kernel version (3.4.10 on HTC and 3.4.0 on Samsung S4) I'm wondering are those differences based only on different hardware components (different camera...)?, 221964=When a quad core 2013 top of the range processor yields a phone with lag (even in the launcher!), where a 2011 phone does not on the same android version, this sort of \"intervention\" is needed. Touchwiz causes regular lag spikes, we need to be able to try Samsung's hardware without this bull****.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Again, the internals on these phones haven\u2019t really changed. Same Snapdragon 600 processors. Same 2GB of RAM. We\u2019re actually looking at the same SKUs as devices we\u2019re already seen. The HTC One is based off the AT&T SKU (same as the \u201cunlocked\u201d and \u201cdeveloper\u201d versions that HTC itself has been selling), and the Galaxy S4 is based off the T-Mobile version. The long and short of it is you can get T-Mobile and AT&T LTE on either of them. Performance and battery life Is it possible a trained audiophile will spot something out of sorts? Possible. But we\u2019re \u201cnormal\u201d users here. To us, they sound exactly the same. Same goes for the Galaxy S4. It\u2019s a different sort of sound from the HTC One \u2014 again, those front-facing speakers are sick \u2014 but it\u2019s still pretty loud and still pretty clear. No difference with headphones, either. So how\u2019s the HTC One sound in the Google Play edition? As far as we can tell, exactly the same as HTC first implemented it. The front-facing speakers are just as loud. (It\u2019s been odd hearing a different sound set blaring at us.) Sound quality with headphones is equal between the two versions of the phone. Another question mark surrounded audio \u2014 particularly on the HTC One, which in its original version has \u201cBoomSound,\u201d which is the umbrella branding given to the software and hardware combination. Google\u2019s also managed to keep the Beats Audio option around. Either you\u2019re a fan of that, or",
    "textAfterTable": "We\u2019re generally not fans of benchmarks around here, especially when comparing the apples of one manufacturer to the oranges of another. But in this case we\u2019ll make an exception, seeing as how we\u2019re dealing with two different software packages on the same hardware, at least as far as the Galaxy S4 is concerned. The HTC One has the issue of HTC's version running Android 4.1.2 and not Android 4.2.1. But what did we find? Not a whole hell of a lot. The numbers are generally close enough for our purposes. In real-world performance, there\u2019s not a lot to write home about either. We\u2019ve seen the occasional UI hiccup on the Google Play edition phones \u2014 annoying cries of \u201cdat lag\u201d should be smothered with a dirty pillow, as we\u2019ve seen nothing of the sort. And certainly nothing as apparent is in the early versions Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S4. The bottom line is that the \u201cstock\u201d Android user interface is still about as lean as it gets. We know everyone\u2019s been hoping for some sort of seismic shift in battery life, given that all the manufacturer and carrier customizations have been stripped away. But here\u2019s the thing. We\u2019ve set up these phones just like we would our daily drivers and used them as our daily drivers. Same apps. Same layouts. Same usage patterns. Where we\u2019ve been getting 12 to 14 hours out of both of them in their manufacturer/carrier-customized versions, we\u2019re getting about the same from the Google Play editions. Goes",
