See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 244.5(b). To be prima facie eligible, it must appear to USCIS that you are eligible for TPS on the face of your application and that there is no known, potentially disqualifying information resulting from your background checks. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 244.1 for more regarding the definition of prima facie eligibility.\u00a0 Final determination on initial TPS applications filed under the re-designation will be made after July 23, 2011, so USCIS can determine whether the applicants have met the \u201ccontinuous physical presence\u201d requirement to have been present in the United States since that date.

Applicants can file for TPS during a 180-day registration period that begins today and ends Nov. 15, 2011. The extension will also allow Haitians who currently have TPS to re-register from May 23, 2011, until Aug. 22, 2011, following publication of the second Federal Register notice on May 23, 2011, outlining re-registration procedures. Haitians who already have TPS must not file before May 23, 2011, for re-registration or their applications will be rejected., 1717=Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano has announced the re-designation of Haiti for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and extended the country\u2019s current TPS designation for 18 months\u2014through Jan. 22, 2013., 22961=If you are re-registering, there is no fee required to submit Form I-821. A biometric services fee of $85 is required if you are 14 years of age or older. You must include the fee of $380 for the Application for Employment Authorization (Form I-765) if you wish to receive an EAD, regardless of age. If you are not seeking an EAD, you must still submit Form I-765 without fee. Please note if you are re-registering for Haiti TPS, you must not file until May 23, 2011, following publication of the Federal Register notice instructing you to file., 1960=Secretary Napolitano first announced that she was designating Haiti for TPS on Jan. 15, 2010, after major earthquakes devastated the country. The designation was effective on Jan. 21, 2010.\u00a0 Following consultations with other federal agencies, Secretary Napolitano has determined that current conditions in Haiti support extending the designation period for current TPS beneficiaries and re-designating Haiti for TPS. The re-designation re-establishes the date by which applicants must prove that they have continuously resided in the United States. Applicants must have continuously resided in the United States since Jan. 12, 2011.}",

During this phase, we may ask you for additional documents to establish your eligibility for TPS.

Please submit this form within the time frame specified in the USCIS notice, or your case will be denied.
