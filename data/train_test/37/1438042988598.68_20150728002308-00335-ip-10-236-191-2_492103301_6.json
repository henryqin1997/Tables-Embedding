Dependinq on the number of integration stages, sigma-delta modulators can be divided into second-order, third-order or fourth-order sigma-delta modulators. Such high-order sigma-delta modulators (SDM) have recently become increasingly interesting in audio and ISDN applications. This is due to the fact that the introduction of high-order modulators increases the number of integrations to be carried out, which results in a decrease in the noise level of the pass band, the quantization noise being shifted to a higher frequency level. This is called quantization noise shaping through integration. This technique provides improved signal-to-noise ratio and improved precision. Thus a high-order sigma-delta modulator would offer an interesting application in A/D or D/A converters., 31379=The system of FIG. 1 comprises two substantially identical second-order sigma-delta modulators A and B. For facilitating the understanding of the invention, corresponding parts in the modulators A and B are indicated with the same reference numerals. Each modulator A and B comprises a series-connection of the following components in this order: a summing means 1, an integrating means 2 (or filter), a summing means 7, an integrating means 4 (or filter) and a quantization unit or comparator 6 at the output of which a final quantized signal D1 or D2 occurs. Each modulator A and B comprises a two-part negative feedback. The feedback comprises a switching unit 10 having an input to which the quantized output signal D1 or D2 is applied and an output connected through a scaling means 8 to one input in the summing means 1 to be subtracted from the input signal and through a scaling means 9 to one input in the summing means 7 to be subtracted from the output signal of the first integrator 2. The switching unit 10 connects either a positive reference voltage +REF or a negative reference voltage -REF to its output, depending on the state of the quantized output signal D1 and D2. The first scaling means 8 scales the output of the switching unit 10 with the number 1 while the second scaling means 9 scales the output of the switching unit 10 with the number 2. The blocks 3 and 5 in FIG. 1 illustrate the delay contained in the integrating means 2 and 4, respectively. Since both integrators 2 and 4 comprise a delay in this specific case, the transfer function of the modulators A and B will be equal to one when the ratio of the scaling factor of the first scaling means 8 to that of the second scaling means 9 is 1:12., 24266=However, the practical realization of a sigma-delta modulator formed by conventionally series-connected integrators is problematic due to the oscillation caused by the feedback loop. It is suggested in \"A 16-bit Oversampling A-to-D Conversion Technology Using Triple-Integration Noise Shaping\", IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits, Vol. SC-22, No. 6, December 1987, p. 921-929, that this problem could be overcome by means of a high-order sigma-delta modulator system formed by cascading several stable first-order sigma-delta modulators. This technique will be called a MASH technique hereinafter. The quantization error of a signal first in the cascade was applied to a sigma-delta modulator second in the cascade to be quantized into an error signal. The quantization error signal was differentiated by a digital differentiator which performed digitally the noise transfer function of the integrator of the first modulator. Thereafter the quantized error signal was subtracted from the quantized output signal of the first modulator, whereby there remains only the quantization noise of the second modulator. Correspondingly, the quantization error of the second modulator was applied to a modulator third in the cascade. The quantized output of the third modulator, in turn, was subtracted from the quantized output signal of the second modulator, and the quantized output signal was subtracted from the output of the first modulator, whereby the third-order quantization noise only remained at the output of the system. In this way, a stable third-order sigma-delta modulator was obtained. An A/D converter realized in this way provides a 16-bit signal-to-quantization noise ratio (S/Nq) within the audio band (24 kHz).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is further to be understood that the figures and the description related thereto are only intended to illustrate the operation of the present invention. In their details, the method and the system according to the present invention may vary within the scope of the attached claims. The modulators A and B of FIG. 1 can be replaced with fully digital modulators, the inputs of which are multi-bit digital signals; correspondingly, the summing means 11 and the scaling means 12 may be realized in digital form, which provides a system which converts the multi-bit input into one-bit output. To be accurate, the signal Dout is not a one-bit signal, so a means converting the output into one-bit form has to be provided at the output of the system. Otherwise the same matters as disclosed in connection with FIG. 1 apply to this kind of digital modulator system. It is particularly suited to a D/A converter, whereby its output comprises an analog filter. The invention can be applied particularly in A/D converters. Thereby a digital filter is connected after the modulator system. It is to be understood that when the system is applied in practice, all the blocks shown in the attached drawings cannot be separated as separate circuit components. For example, when using so called switched capacitors, the summing means 11, the scaling means 12, the summing means 1 and the scaling means 8 can be",
