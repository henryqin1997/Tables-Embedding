    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0068] A number of implementations of the invention have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, a tie, such as in blackjack may neither end the streak wager nor advance the progress along the streak wager. The house can determine rules to deal with particular situations such as a tie. The streak wager area can be horizontally or vertically oriented, and two- or three-dimensional. Implementations that have been described above in an electronic form can be implemented in a physical form, such as a table, a wheel, a pit or as cards. Similarly, implementations that have been described above in a physical form can also be implemented in an electronic form. In some implementations of the streak game, different streak combinations can be selected to occur consecutively to make up a streak round. An example of multiple different streak combinations making up a single streak round where the main game is poker includes a first streak combination of two hands with a pair occurring in a row and a second streak combination of three consecutive rounds of poker where the outcome is three of a kind. The streak round is won when the two streak combinations are achieved consecutively. Although a streak round is generally described as being based on a main round, a streak round",
