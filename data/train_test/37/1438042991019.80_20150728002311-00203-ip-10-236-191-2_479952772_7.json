    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{25546=A network is a system of computers that are connected to each other (and possibly to terminals and other peripheral devices) by communications lines which may be physical and/or wireless. Each computer on a network may be generally classified as a \u2018client\u2019 (i.e. a computer that initiates requests) or a \u2018server\u2019 (i.e. a computer that receives and responds to requests), although a single computer may also perform different roles at different times. Transfers of information across the network are typically conducted in compliance with one or more network protocols to ensure that the information may be properly delivered and interpreted. One such protocol is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP, an application-level protocol that provides a basis for information transfer across the Internet and is specified e.g. in RFC 2616 (\u201cHypertext Transfer Protocol\u2014HTTP/1.1\u201d), R. Fielding et al., June 1999, which document is available at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt. As shown in FIG. 1, HTTP is a query/response protocol in which an entity such as a client 30 directs a query for information to a specific resource (such as a file or web page, as identified by a Universal Resource Locator or URL) and another entity such as a server 40 forwards an appropriate response associated with that resource.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing description is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make or use the present invention. Various modifications to these embodiments are possible, and the generic principles presented herein may also be applied to other embodiments. For example, an embodiment of the invention may use a connection entity that is implemented as any combination of (1) hardware such as a computer or a device for processing network traffic such as a router, (2) firmware loaded into non-volatile storage, and/or (3) software loaded into random-access memory in the form of machine-readable code, such code being executable by an array of logic elements such as a microprocessor or other digital signal processing unit. The connection entity may also reside on a dedicated computer or may be simply one among several tasks executing on one computer. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown above, but rather, is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and novel features disclosed in any fashion herein. As described above, a method or apparatus according to an embodiment of the invention allows a secure connection to be established with an entity outside a LAN without changing the infrastructure of the LAN and while reducing monitoring costs. In one implementation, this connection is supported by communication through a trusted third-party website, thereby minimizing the risk of damage to the LAN due",
