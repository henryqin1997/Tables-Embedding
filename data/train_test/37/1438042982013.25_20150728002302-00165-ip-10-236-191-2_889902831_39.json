Even though I don't live on campus, I am generally on campus from morning until like 10:00 PM because there are so many events/activities that go on throughout the week.

Tips for prospective students I would recommend to keep up on the readings for every class. Get the readings done before class so you can use the class discussions as a review. Also, get involved in extracurricular activities from the very beginning. Take advantage of opportunities that arise. Use the activities to meet new friends.
