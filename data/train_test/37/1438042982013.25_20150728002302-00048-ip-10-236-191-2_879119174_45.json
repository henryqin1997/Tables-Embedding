            "There is plenty to do for fun in Edinburg. Joining a sorority/fraternity is an excellent example. There is an abundant number of clubs and other fun things to join there at UTPA.",
            "The cafeteria food was not your typical high school cafeteria food. The people that worked there were extremely friendly and talkative. UTPA probably has one of the best food and dining services.",
            "I lived in the unity dorm for my first year of college. I liked it because for one, you get the chance of meeting new people and you get to live within doors/floors away from them. Another advantage to this was if you wanted to study with someone, they were pretty much right next door.",
            "Some professor really go into detail with their classes but other are laid back. I was fortunate enough to have a couple of awesome professors that actually cared about their students and if they learned or not. Academic is a big factor in every school's performance.",
            "My number one advice to give to new students that just got out of high school and are going into college is that high school they babied you. It's true what people say about college. You need to grow up and start looking after yourself, either you study and work your butt off or you're just going to mess up.",
            "The University of Texas-Pan American is looked at as another community college, but honestly, it's an amazing school. I went there this past fall and spring semester and I really enjoyed my experience there. This school seems to be growing not only academically but in size as well."

The campus is expanding in many ways including its parking. Having attended Texas State University in 2002 I can say for a college it offers everything along with many opportunities to network and get the full college experience., 626930=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 266574=The University of Texas-Pan American is a campus that I've been attending since 2005 and now going for my masters. The faculty are very helpful and do their best to help make my time here effortless. However, the paperwork to apply for admission has been total confusion from the start and I felt that I was getting nowhere for quite some time.}",
