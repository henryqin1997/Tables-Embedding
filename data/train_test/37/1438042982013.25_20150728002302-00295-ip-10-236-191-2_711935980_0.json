WHY To give triathletes a purpose-built, tri-specific, highly aero bike (especially in crosswinds) that is uber-fast but also offers optimized fit for a wide spectrum of riders. Plus with fully-housed, internal cable routing, rebuild after travel and normal maintenance is considerably quicker and less complicated. HOW By ignoring UCI rules that don\u2019t pertain to tri anyway, we were able to design extra-deep airfoil tubing and fork (up to 6:1 ratios), and a massive headtube. These tubes dramatically improve airflow over the standard 3:1 ratio tubing, and designing each area of tubing separately allowed us to optimize them for the specific airflow. Finally all areas are optimized for crosswinds, more typical than straight-on headwinds, especially in tri. COMPREHENSIVE NUTRITION/HYDRATION",
