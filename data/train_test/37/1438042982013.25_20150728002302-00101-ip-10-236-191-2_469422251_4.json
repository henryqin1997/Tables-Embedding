The DNA binding domain may bind to DNA as monomers or as homo- and/or heterodimers, in a sequence-specific manner. The POU family members are transcriptional regulators, many of which are known to control cell type-specific differentiation pathways. This gene is a tumor suppressor involved in Wilms tumor (WT) predisposition. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Oct 2009]}",
