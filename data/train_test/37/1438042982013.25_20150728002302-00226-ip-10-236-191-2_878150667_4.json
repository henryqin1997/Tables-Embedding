Check out more info on Super Bowl 2013 tickets over on the SeatGeek Blog., 1643=3/11/15: The Jacksonville Jaguars are veterans of drafting in the top 10. What that really means is that they have had a lot of years where they have finished very low in the standings. What that really means is that they have had a lot of bad teams in recent years. This is year three of the Gus Bradley Era and it is time to show some progress. QB Blake Bortles is no longer a rookie and will be expected to do more. Additionally, the Jags are carrying over the most money of any NFL team towards the 2015 salary cap - almost $22 million. With that kind of money, they should be able to land a few outstanding free agents., 60875=3/28/13: The Jaguars waived wide receiver Laurent Robinson earlier in the month, which was odd considering how much they courted and payed Robinson to get him to Jacksonville and away from the Cowboys a year ago. Bu t this is a different regime and has no ties to the past roster. The team did sign slot receiver Jordan Shipley as his apparent replacement. Shipley was a third round pick of the Bengals a few years ago, and had a good rookie season. He has since battled injuries and was waived last September. Now healthy, he hopes to make a go of it in Jacksonville., 20090=7/3/14: The Jags may have selected the right man to lead them over the next decade or so when they pick Blake Bortles to be their QB of the future with the third overall pick back in May. By all accounts, Bortles is a humble and hard working guy that realizes that he will have a redshirt year in his rookie season in the NFL. He is taking that time to learn from veteran Chad Henne, who himself is playing for a contract from a new team for next year. Bortles admitted that he thought that he may be going to Cleveland, that is until the Jags stepped in and took him third overall., 62356=3/14/13: Jacksonville said they would not be too active in the free agency, and they are being true to their word. To date, their only move has been to sign Geno Hayes. The Hayes signing means they may have found a replacement for Daryl Smith. Hayes was a sixth round pick out of Florida State in 2008 by Tampa. He was a dominant line backer in college, and has proven to be a solid pro. He spent four years with the Bucs and last season with Chicago. The signing is a reunion, as Hayes played for new Jags head coach Gus Bradley in his rookie season., 23850=5/22/14: The Blake Bortles era is about to begin in Jacksonville. Sort of. It is no secret that the team is in dire need of a franchise QB. The team reached for Blaine Gabbert three years ago and that proved to be an unmitigated disaster. So the Jags hit the 'reset' button. But Bortles is not expected to start right away. The team says that Chad Henne will be the starter next season and Bortles will get the nod in 2015. That is not a bad plan, and, in fact, was how it was done throughout the history of the NFL until recently. Perhaps Gabbert would still be there if the Jags had used that method with him rather than rushing him into duty so early., 55960=5/23/13: Jacksonville is an interesting story. It is a good city, but there are a lot of concerns these days of whether Jacksonville should have been given an NFL team at all. In 1988, Jacksonville made a very lucrative offer to land the then St. Louis Cardinals. The Cardinals chose Phoenix instead. Jacksonville got a team in the early 1990's and had a fair share of early success. But recent struggles and the economic downturn leave empty seats. Now the Jags are among the worst teams in the league. With a new coaching staff, hopefully they can turn out of their recent tailspin., 13821=9/24/14: The Jags have started the current season in the same way they started last year, by dropping their first three games (the 2013 Jags lost their first eight games before going 4-4 in the second half of the season). But there is a ray of sunshine this season, other than a top draft pick. After trailing 30-0 at halftime, head coach Gus Bradley reversed course and put in third overall draft pick Blake Bortles - and announced that Bortles would be the starter for the rest of the season. Bortles threw for 223 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions in the second half. He will get his first start on Sunday at San Diego., 22010=6/12/14: Ace Sanders has only been in Jacksonville one season, but he may be on the way out already. He was a fourth round pick in 2013, and had a decent rookie campaign with 51 receptions for 484 yards. He also returned 25 punts with a 5.6 yard per return. Those stats tend to show the issue. He can catch balls, but is not getting many yards after the catch. At 5'7, the way to stay in the league is to be able to make guys miss. Sanders may have trouble staying on the 53 man roster, and even with Justin Blackmon suspended indefinitely, the Jags may think they still have better options., 23251=5/29/14: The Jags have been building interest, at least in Florida, since they drafted QB Blake Bortles with the third overall pick a few weeks ago. Bortles is from the Orlando area and played his college ball at the University of Central Florida, which is about two hours away. Bortles is expected to backup Chad Henne this coming season and take the reigns in 2015. The Jags get a lot of criticism for not filling up their stadium. At the same time, they still averaged more fans per game than the Tampa Bay Buccaneers last season - and that is after tarping off the top section., 5602=1/28/15: Once again, the Jacksonville Jaguars are going back to the drawing board on offense. Last season was highlighted by the drafting and rookie season of Blake Bortles who is expected to be the face of the franchise. And what is old is new again. The Jaguars hired Greg Olson to be their new offensive coordinator - so he now has the task of developing Bortles to be a franchise QB and putting points on the board. If his name sounds familiar, it should. He was the QB coach in Jacksonville in 2012 and was most recently the OC for the Oakland Raiders., 18161=7/24/14: Fairly or unfairly, new Jags running back Toby Gerhart has earned a perception of a plodding power back that runs only north-south and smashes through the line of scrimmage. The reality is actually much different and he handled himself quite well when he got the chance in Minnesota (usually when Adrian Peterson was injured). He is now the starting running back in Jacksonville and could double his 276 career regular season in 2014. Head coach Gus Bradley says he is much faster than anticipated and that bodes well for the team as they try to rebuild this season., 4209=2/11/15: The Jacksonville Jaguars are doing their best to make game day in downtown Jacksonville more than just a trip to a football game. Last year they announced the addition of swimming pools in the upper deck of the end zone sides and this year they are announcing a plan to develop The Shipyards, a city-owned vacant plot near the stadium. No formal plans have been submitted to the city, but there should be an update on February 16th. Speculation for the land includes a team training facility as well as a mixed-use development. That could mean bars and restaurants, or even a Jaguars Village type facility. It is also a good move by the Jags to show that they are committed to staying in Jacksonville., 28794=3/27/14: The Jags hired Gus Bradley in 2013 as head coach to rebuild the team. He had been the defensive coordinator of a terrific Seattle defense (one that won the Super Bowl in the season after he left). One common theme that many people rave about is Bradley's unbridled optimism. Apparently, his former players in Seattle loved him, as three from the defense signed with Jacksonville in free agency. Bradley did it again by getting running back Toby Gerhart to sign with the Jags. Gerhart himself says that Bradley's enthusiasm was a key reason for his decision. Don't look now, but Jacksonville is quietly putting together a decent roster., 16964=8/7/14: When the Jacksonville Jaguars selected QB Blake Bortles with the third overall pick (and first QB off the board) in the draft back in May, they did so with good reason. Certainly Johnny Manziel (Texas A&M) and Teddy Bridgewater (Louisville) were higher profile guys. But Bortles is has the most upside and does not come with the media baggage. While none have played a game in the NFL, Bortles is proving himself to be a dedicated student of the game. This bodes well for the Jags, as they have a guy that does everything to get better and is flying under the media radar., 63487=2/21/13: Jags quarterback Blaine Gabbert has been more of a punchline than a longterm answer for Jacksonville since he was drafted with the 10th overall pick in 2011. While it is true that he has not adjusted to the game like Andrew Luck or Cam Newton, there are some mitigating factors - like the fact that he plays in Jacksonville and does not have the talent around him that others do. But his former QB coach said that if he came out this year that he would be the number one ranked QB on the board. That really is a testament to how weak the quarterbacks are in this draft., 38163=12/12/13: The Jacksonville Jags have shown a lot of progress over the past several weeks. They have won four of their last five games and their last three in a row. The latest win was a 27-20 victory over the hapless Houston Texans, and really showed that the team has bought into head coach Gus Bradley's word. The Jags will have a high draft pick in April, but they are finding that QB Chad Henne can be a serviceable stopgap solution. One option available is to draft a new franchise quarterback, but then not ruin him by forcing him to play to early and instead letting him learn and develop for a year or two., 37543=12/19/13: Jacksonville has played well of late and seems to have bought into head coach Gus Bradley's message and techniques. The Jags are clearly in rebuilding mode and were looking for their first four game winning streak since 2007. Unfortunately, the Buffalo Bills had other ideas. Buffalo effectively balanced their rushing and passing attacks to gain almost 350 yards, as the Jags fell 27-20. Of course, the Jags are out of playoff contention, but are showing that they are a team on the rise and could surprise a few people next year. Jacksonville (4-10) host the rival Titans (5-9) this Sunday., 36329=1/2/14: The 2013 season is finally over for the Jacksonville Jaguars, and it was a tough season by any stretch. The team lost their first eight games of the season, but did come back to win four of the final eight. Everyone knows that QB Blaine Gabbert has been a bust and that Chad Henne is not the long-term solution. Most experts have the Jags taking a franchise QB with their first round pick. However, Henne has proven serviceable, so there is always a chance that the Jags could take someone like Jadavian Clowney with their first pick and get a QB later (to groom under Henne for a year or two)., 6775=1/14/15: The Jacksonville Jaguars are committed to playing a few games in London over a several year span, which has led some to speculate that they may one day move to the capital of England. They will not be moving in the near future, and, quite frankly, there is probably just as good of a chance that the Jags move to St. Louis as London at this point. In any case, the Jags will play Rex Ryan and the Buffalo Bills in London next season on October 4, 2015 and that will be a 1:30pm kickoff local time. Translate that to North America, and it means that the game will be at 9:30am Eastern Time., 7391=1/7/15: Proving that personality and perception matters, Head coach Gus Bradley seems to have earned a pass from the media and fans, despite only winning seven games in his two years in the position, and actually winning less in 2014 than in 2013. The 3-13 record this season earned the Jags the third overall pick in 2015 draft, but they will not get the 'easiest' schedule of the division because Tennessee only won two games. The Jags hope they have their franchise QB in place with Blake Bortles, but they have drafted in the top 10 many times in the past seven years, but have very little to show for it., 15092=8/28/14: The Jags had a plan when they selected QB Blake Bortles with the third overall pick in the NFL Draft back in May. He will be the franchise quarterback, just not right away. The Jags seem to be sticking to that plan and Chad Henne will get the start on opening day. Henne is not an elite QB by any means, but he is serviceable. On the other hand, Bortles continues to impress in camp and preseason games and even threw his first touchdown pass against the Lions last Friday. He is playing well enough that he may not be the second stringer very long. And if his play is any indication of the future, then the Jags made the right choice., 32003=2/20/14: Like fellow running backs Knowshawn Moreno (Denver Broncos) and Darren McFadden (Oakland Raiders), Jags star RB Maurice Jones-Drew is likely to be looking for work and earning a new uniform in the 2014 season. MJD has been a standout in Jacksonville, and (unlike Moreno and McFadden) has been relatively healthy for his career. But he will carry a bigger price tag than the Jags want to pay, and they already stood him down when he tried to hold out for an extension two years ago. Also, since the Jags are rebuilding, it probably makes sense to go with a young veteran or draft someone new., 2285=3/4/15: The Jacksonville Jaguars have picked in the top 10 in the NFL draft so often in the last decade that they practically have a set reservation. In fact, they have had a top 10 pick every years since 2008 and this will be the fourth consecutive year picking in the top five. They will pick third again this season, and that may be linebacker Dante Fowler from nearby University of Florida. The Jags may also get active in free agency and another wide receiver could be in the mix. Do not be surprised if they try to persuade Randall Cobb to move to the Sunshine State to be a number one receiver., 25065=5/8/14: The Jacksonville Jaguars moved up two years ago to select wide receiver Justin Blackmon, in the first round. The actually moved up past the St. Louis Rams to do so, and had aspirations that he would be an elite receiver in the NFL. He certainly has the skills and has put up impressive stats when he has been available. Of course he is serving he second suspension since he came into the league, and the Jags do not expect him to be eligible to play at all in the 2014 season. The suspension, they expect, will go for at least through the next season. What has not been determined is if the Jags will keep Blackmon around after he is reinstated., 35731=1/9/14: Jacksonville did not win a lot of games last season - just four in total. The teams they beat were Houston (twice), Tennessee, and Cleveland. Those teams have a few things in common - all had losing records. All had serious QB problems due to injury or poor play. And all fired their head coach after the season. In short, losing to the Jags was a fireable offense. Jacksonville has a top five pick in the draft in May. They are expected to take a QB, but there is an argument to be made for taking Jadaveon Clowney if he is available, or even trading down for more picks., 62925=3/7/13: Fans and media alike have criticized quarterback Blaine Gabbert ever since he came into the league in 2011. But now even his off field and locker room attitude are being criticized by former coaches. One former coach claims that \"nothing is ever his fault\" and that he is known around the franchise as Blame Gabbert. Even though he is only two years into his NFL career and never had much talent around him, the team may elect to cut him and go with Chad Henne or a veteran retread next season simply to stop the bleeding now., 55268=5/30/13: One key piece of information that is continually ignored is that star running back Maurice Jones-Drew should return at full health for the Jags this season. Many people forget that he was sidelined early on in 2012, and missed most of the season. Some cynics speculate that either the team or MJD himself kept him off the field when it became apparent that last season's version of the team was terrible. Keeping him off the field shielded him from further injury and solidified a high (No. 2 overall) draft spot. However, if he is back in 2013, then that will take pressure off the QB du jour, and allow more opportunities for WRs Justin Blackmon and Cecil Shorts., 65917=1/24/13: What do the Jags do with star running back Maurice Jones-Drew? MJD is among the best RBs in the game when healthy, but he missed most of 2012 with a foot injury. He held out all of training camp in a contract dispute, as new owner Shad Khan would not renegotiate his contract. He has one year left on his deal now and is creeping towards 30 years old. Perhaps the best option is to trade him for draft picks and rebuild the team over the next few years, rather than sign MJD to a bloated long-term agreement that will hamper the franchise for years., 30728=3/6/14: There is a very good chance that longtime Jags running back Maurice Jones-Drew will not be back next season. He is getting up there in age and wants a big contract - likely the last big one he will be able to get. While it is uncertain where MJD will end up, the team seems to want to give Denard Robinson more time at running back. Last season, Robinson's rookie year, he was listed as 'offensive weapon', though did not see much time on the field. That should in 2014, and head coach Gus Bradley says that Robinson will get plenty of chances to play this time around.}",
