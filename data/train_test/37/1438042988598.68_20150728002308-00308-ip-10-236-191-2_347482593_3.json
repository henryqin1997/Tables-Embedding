I'm likely not to blog tomorrow for various reasons, so let's take a look at Friday's matchup. \u00a0 Carlos Beltran. \u00a0Freese was able to come into last night's game when Schumaker left and get a couple of at-bats, but that wasn't the optimal situation for the Redbirds. \u00a0An off day today, though, and hopefully he's good to go for Friday. \u00a0Beltran's knee was again barking at him, limiting him to pinch-hitting in the eighth instead of starting. \u00a0It sounds like that was more precautionary and he'll be ready to go Friday as well, but I don't think any of us will be surprised if his leg actually detaches on the flight to New York. David Freese and Plus you have the nagging injuries of Adron Chambers gets a little longer in the bigs, though. Allen Craig is supposed to be returning, so they'll likely swap places and not have to raid Memphis again, but it's still",

It's a matchup of aces coming off of injury as the Mets will throw Johan Santana. \u00a0Like Wainwright, he's had his ups and down this year and, like Wainwright, he's thrown a shutout against San Diego, doing that last time out. \u00a0 PA AB",
