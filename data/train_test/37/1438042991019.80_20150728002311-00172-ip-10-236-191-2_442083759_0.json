While he was once again a steady force in the Milwaukee rotation, he was not exactly ace material until he went on the DL in August. After his \"rest period,\" he had a 291 ERA and pitched nearly an inning more per start in his last 8 games. His strikeout rate took a significant dip, dropping from 8.99 in 2011 and 9.00 in 2012 to 7.17 last season. Fortunately, he maintained his extreme groundball tendencies to keep his homerun rate below one per nine innings. A rested Gallardo will again serve as the ace of the Brewers' staff, and if you can deal with the reduced strikeout tendency, he could be a decent SP4 for your team., 96520=Although his first full season in the Brewers' rotation was far from a success-4.37 ERA, 1.42 WHIP and only 129 strikeouts over 183.1 innings in 2013-he is back as a member of the starting staff in 2014. Wily Peralta does induce a ton of groundballs, which helps him overcome his less than stellar strikeout rate, but he needs to improve his control if he wishes to succeed as part of the back end of the Milwaukee rotation. You need to be desperate to draft him without a better indication of an ability to limit base runners., 98642=The Brewer rotation showcases 3 pitchers that can provide some strikeout potential for your fantasy teams, and Gallardo, Garza and Estrada should all be on your draft radar. Lohse and Peralta, not at all pitchers I am going to target this March, except in drafts with deep pitching rotation slots or lots of bench spots., 97205=Marco Estrada, just like Gallardo, was a different pitcher after a stint on the DL, posting a 2.15 ERA in his final nine starts. Coincidentally, he also participated in the WBC last season, so maybe there is something to this dislike of the tournament by MLB front offices. Estrada racks up strikeouts at a nice pace, 8.30 K/9 last season, which was down from the 9.30 he posted in 2012, but still tasty. Limiting walks also keeps his value high, and of all the Brewer starters, I would recommend taking him over the other members of the rotation, despite what Garza's ADP indicates.}",
