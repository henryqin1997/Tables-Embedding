One skilled in the art may make changes and modifications to the embodiments disclosed herein and may devise other embodiments without departing from the scope and essential characteristics thereof. To maintain the socket and plug connection, a latch-type lock assembly 30, comprised of a latch 32 and a post 34 and an overstress bar, is used to lock together the socket 16 and plug 12. When plug 14 is inserted over surface 18 and seal 22, as shown in FIG. 5, the ribs 26 fold in a direction away from the end of the plug 22 and with one of the ribs 26 folding into an inner rib region 25 while another rib folds into another region 27 on the outer surface of shaft 22 adjacent to the other rib. The annular space region 20 and the thickness of the fold ribs 20--20 within the inner rib regions 25 and 27 to substantially eliminate any compressive force that would contribute to the mating force between the outer surface of the plug support structure 14 and the ribs 26--26. The folded ribs 26--26 within the annular space region 20 is sufficient to prevent seepage of liquid and solid elements from entering the connector assembly and traveling to the terminals of the plug and socket.
