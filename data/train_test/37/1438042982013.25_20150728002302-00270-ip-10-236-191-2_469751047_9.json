    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{46421=From an acquisition cost and maintenance, cost perspective, early detection at the DPRCS can result in a 3:1 reduction in the number of detectors. This is a result of the DPRCS being capable of processing 120,000 or more mailpieces per hour while an AFCS can only process 36,000 letters per hour. The initial acquisition cost reduction can be very significant when presently \u201creal-time\u201d CBWA detectors typically cost between $100,000 and $275,000 each just for the basic instrumentation alone., 27418=Since the use of Anthrax in the United States Mail in October 2001, government organizations have becoming increasingly interested in detecting dangerous substances such as microorganisms, chemicals, or biological warfare agents which could be distributed through the mail system to promote the agenda of a terrorist organization. As the postal service and mail delivery is a virtually universal service touching the lives of almost all people throughout the United States and many more throughout the world, the postal service presents a potentially limitless distribution network for a terrorist group to utilize. Further, by the time a letter or package has reached the final destination, it has often been handled by many individuals, some of whom may not be known without a lengthy investigation. Any or all of these individuals may have been exposed to the substance and could be affected without rapid medical response. Further, in the case of a contagious substance, trying to quarantine those exposed prior to the contagion becoming epidemic may be virtually impossible., 45960=If the CBWA is detected at the DPRCS (101) or (103), less than 100 feet of conveyor in one system is contaminated. However, if the CBWA is not detected until the AFCS (111) there can be over 1000 feet of conveyor and anywhere from 3 to 10 or more pieces of equipment may be contaminated. The time to decontaminate the facility and the associated cost impact dramatically increases with this later detection., 28530=October 2001 was not the first use of the mail for terrorist acts. Mail bombs and even dangerous pranks were common long before the mail was used as a method for distributing a biological warfare agent. In addition to purposeful terrorist acts, sometimes dangerous substances are shipped in the mails innocently or for other purposes. Dangerous substances may be shipped by a person who simply does not think of the consequences or the mail may be utilized for other illicit acts such as drug trafficking., 26784=This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/385,004 filed May 31, 2002 the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.}",

Modifications and variations of the described embodiments may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, and other embodiments should be understood to be encompassed in the present disclosure as would be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. . FIGS. 4-13 provide drawings of an embodiment of an RCM, air handling system, and DPRCS in accordance with the present invention. This embodiment is shown from multiple angles and multiple views showing structures similar to those described and shown in FIGS. 14 through 19 In embodiments, the RCM (701) may be provided as a replacement for the portion (700) of the DPRCS (400) allowing for these items to be removed and replaced. Alternatively, the RCM (701) could be provided as the components of a kit for use to convert an existing DPRCS (400) into the DPRCS (400) with an RCM (701). In a still further embodiment, the DPRCS could be originally manufactured with an RCM (701). To provide a higher degree of safety, in an embodiment of the invention, the entire DPRCS (400) area, possibly including the hamper staging area, may be enclosed within a biological containment system or isolated environment to segregate the",
