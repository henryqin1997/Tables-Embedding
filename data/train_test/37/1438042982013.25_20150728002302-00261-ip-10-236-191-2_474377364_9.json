    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes It will be apparent from the foregoing that while particular forms of the invention have been illustrated and described, various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Pharmacological treatments may also be used in combination with ablation procedures to relieve the atrial arrhythmia. By retaining the electrode within the lumen of the catheter and by forcing the conductive media out the openings in the catheter body, the electrode does not directly contact the cardiac tissue or the blood present in the chamber where the ablation procedure is performed. This reduces both coagulum buildup and the likelihood of clot formation. The device of the instant invention is designed to produce a linear lesion without exposing the surface of the ablation electrode to direct contact either with blood or cardiac tissue. In addition, the process disclosed herein provides an efficient procedure for the creation of linear lesions and ablation tracks without the associated problems present with prior art devices. Thermosensing devices, such as thermocouples (32), are secured to the ablation catheter (10) to determine whether sufficient energy has been applied to the tissue to create an adequate linear lesion. After the ablation procedure is completed, a sensing electrode, such as a tip electrode (30), may be utilized as a sensing system to determine if the arrhythmia has been eliminated at the particular location within the heart. Additional ablation lesions or",
