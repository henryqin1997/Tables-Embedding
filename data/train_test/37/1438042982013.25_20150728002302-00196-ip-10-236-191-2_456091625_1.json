The World of Twelve has fallen into chaos, and is in desperate need for heroes to bring hope to the masses. Players can do just that when they start as one of 14 distinct character classes, customize it to their liking, and declare allegiance to a nation. From there, they can defend their nation against enemy attacks, conquer new territories and even run for governor! Players will learn to harness Wakfu, the primordial energy of the universe, to help bring peace to the World of Twelve. A dynamic world with an evolving ecosystem, players can either protect or exploit natural resources, all of which have in-game consequences.
