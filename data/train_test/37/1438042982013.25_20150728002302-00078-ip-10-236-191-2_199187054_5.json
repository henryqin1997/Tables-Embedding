Some of these compounds showed a significant reduction in the LPS-induced TNFalpha production in human whole blood. Structure-activity relationship studies revealed that N-oxide oxygen was essential for activity and was probably a determinant factor for its marked selectivity against other related kinases. After an extensive SAR exercise, several compounds from this series were identified as very potent p38alpha inhibitors. In vivo efficacy of some derivatives was demonstrated to reduce TNFalpha levels in an acute murine model of inflammation (ED(50) = 0.5 mg/kg in LPS-induced TNFalpha production when dosed orally 1.5 h prior to",
