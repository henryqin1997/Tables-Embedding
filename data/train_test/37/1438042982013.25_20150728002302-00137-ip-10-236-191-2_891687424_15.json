    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students I felt like it defiantly wasn't a waste of money but you have to do the work in order to really succeed here. They dont hold your hand and you really have to navigate your path if you want to graduate there in 2 years. Word to the wise dont go into individual studies until u know exactly what you want because they dont know how to really guide you when it comes to picking class. I began to think of it this way as my friends spent so much money on a four year diploma i was getting an associates in two years and then a bachelors in another 2 and then hopefully a masters so in a way community college kinda splits up the amount of time it really takes to graduate with a bachelors degree. Bang for the buck I was suppose to go to siena however i could afford it and siena like most colleges hasn't really been sharing the wealth. HVCC is amazing and i saved so much money going here. Did enjoy being here was a skeptic about HVCC in the beginning. I really just wanted to get out of town and have that college experience. Well that cant be done cheaply unless your parents are",
