Daddy was a rather closed-mouthed individual, which worked sometimes, but caused him considerable anguish at other times. The area media and The Lancaster News were critical because he rarely gave interviews or issued press releases on criminal cases. \u00a0 Only in his later years did he confide that it was up to magistrates and judges to determine guilt and folks shouldn\u2019t be tried in the court of public opinion., 24349=\u2013 Editor\u2019s note: Due to reader requests, we are reprinting this Remember When column, which was originally published in the Nov. 19, 2006, edition of The Lancaster News. The story of Jim the turkey has indeed become a Thanksgiving tradition at The Lancaster News., 25652=I made it through May, in real good shape. Of course, I had to go over to Central School and walk around that May Pole, wrapping a strip of colored crepe paper while bunches of children from all over town stood in little huddles and sang songs nobody knew. It might make our teachers and principals happy but it sure seemed like a waste of time to me. Betcha if they just passed out Dixie cups of chocolate ice cream we would\u2019ve had more fun. It\u2019s always amazed me how grown-ups can mess up a good thing., 27044=Editor\u2019s note \u2013 Remember When columnist W.B. \u201cBill\u201d Evans is enjoying the Easter holiday with his family. We are reprinting this column, which was published on Easter Sunday 2011 at a reader\u2019s request, with a few updates., 43047=Copyright \u00a9 2015, 21456=Editor\u2019s note: This Remember When column was originally published in the June 19, 2008, edition of The Lancaster News. Given it\u2019s relevance to how Main Street and downtown Lancaster was in its heyday, we thought our readers would enjoy reading it again.}",
