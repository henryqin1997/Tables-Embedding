Electromagnetic simulation codes are used to perform these calculations. The exact geometry of the illumination and probe beams will be chosen after careful modeling of the scatter from particles of different size and refractive index and from inherent surface roughness. These electromagnetic simulation codes are known in the art. One such code is known as TSAR (developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory). A description of TSAR is found in \u201cUsing the TSAR electromagnetic modeling system\u201d UCRL-ID 115227, September 1993, incorporated herein by reference and published by the University of California at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Other commercially available codes include EMFLEX (Weidlinger Associates), Maxwell EMINENCE (Ansoft Corp.), MAFIA (CST) and DDSURF (ASU). A description of DDSURF is shown in a document titled \u201cDDSURF/RDSURF User's Manual\u201d \ufffd1998 Arizona State University, incorporated herein by reference. The referenced document was authored by Brent M. Nedeker and E. Dan Hirleman, both of the Laser Diagnostics Laboratory, Arizona State University., 30551=The proposed 1999 SIA Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors is accelerating the reduction in dense line critical dimensions (CDs) to 23 nm by the year 2011. This will put a tremendous burden on mask fabrication, particularly in the area of defect detection and reduction. Mask defects as small as one-eighth the equivalent CD are printable and may cause chip failure. Table 1 shows the maximum permissible defect size for each lithography generation out to the year 2011.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing description of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description and is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. The embodiments were chosen and described to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical application to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best use the invention in various embodiments and with various modifications suited to the particular use contemplated. The scope of the invention is to be defined by the following claims. To further enhance detection performance, the invention exploits the angular and polarization dependence of the scattered fields. Scattering from a defect will generally have a unique polarization and angular distribution signature depending on the defect geometry and refractive index. To take advantage of this fact, the surface is illuminated with both s and p polarizations and the corresponding scattered components are measured with multiple probe beams. These measurements allow us to better identify the specific defect. To enhance detection performance, the incident angle and polarization are chosen to maximize the particle scatter and to minimize the noise from the background scatter. A reference signal from each AO frequency shifter is sent to a mixer 76 the output of which is sent to a mixer/integrator 78. In a manner similar to the embodiment shown in FIG.",
