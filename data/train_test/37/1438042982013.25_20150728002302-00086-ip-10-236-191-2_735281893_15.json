    "textAfterTable": "Recent Meetings NO RECENT MEETINGS Commentary One common opponent here, Atlanta beat Carolina in North Carolina 27-10 while KC lost to Carolina 17-28 at Arrowhead. Not surprising as Atlanta is 5-1 SU while KC is 1-4. So, exactly why is a 1-4 Chiefs team laying points to a 5-1 Falcons squad? I have no idea. Thank you John Q. Public..all the Chiefs had to do was win one lousy game, and now the public\u2019s back on the KC bandwagon and this line keeps going up and up. Sorry guys, you\u2019re wrong. Kansas City loses their games by nearly a touchdown while the Falcons are winning by five points and you\u2019re laying points with the Chiefs? I don\u2019t think so. Atlanta should be the next team to move the ball with impunity against a toothless Chiefs defense. I know the Falcons aren\u2019t an offensive juggernaut right now, but they have enough to score on this defense. Kansas City couldn\u2019t come up with the big effort last week when they really needed it, they won\u2019t get it here either. The computer says Atlanta as a road dog wins outright with the game going under the total, so give me points with the better football team and I\u2019ll have a smile on my face when I cash my ticket.
