It's a great level and all, but it is seriously the only level people choose. I played countless games on it for a few months, and I saw one other level (I forgot what it was now, even) twice. Every other game seriously was Two Fort. If not for that bizarre anomaly, I'd still be loving that Orange Box, myself. Of course, if playing with friends and not the random match-up service, you could pick any level, but I didn't know any other PS3 owners at the time.",

Games I have: Warhawk, Resistance 1 (haven't played it at all, but I have it), LBP (check out my levels if you like, but I try to stay off online multiplayer in that game), and a number of PSN games, some of which should have multiplayer (can't remember too clearly right now). I'll be good for Uncharted 2 when it comes out, plus I plan to be on the beta therefor. I'll also DEFINITELY be on Ratchet online if they ever bother to announce that they're bringing it back (I sure hope they do...)!",

I played the Lumines demo and wasn't really impressed, but there weren't many game modes available. After how much time I spent with Meteos, Lumines' sister game, I was a bit disappointed. Do you find it's a good download? I've been tempted to get it for a long time but usually forget about it. Oh, also, I have Ragdoll Kung Fu. For some reason Sony changed it to a free download last week after being on sale for a few weeks. It's a decent game. Not sure if it has online, but if it does, I'd love to try against some human opponents.",

            "13. Posted: Thu 21st May 2009 18:40 BST My friend kept going on and on about this awesome game called Lumines. I got it when I saw it on the psn but I've only played it a few times. I guess my expectations were too high. There really aren't many game modes and I've only gotten 1 trophy so far. A few of the songs are also kind of annoying. I put more time into puzzlers on WiiWare. There are games coming out like the Star Trek DAC that I really want but I'm afraid of buying it and then finding it available for free a couple weeks later. Ragdoll Kung Fu was ok but I already regretted buying it before it was free. There are also a couple of games I got that dropped in price like Bionic Commando Rearmed. I'm thinking I should start waiting a while before buying certain games. The only one I know I'm getting for sure the day it comes out is Fat Princess. Can't wait for that one.",

Sometimes I want to stay holding onto the ceiling, and sometimes I want to swing, but the arm seems to have a mind of its own when it comes to deciding between these options. The network hacking mini-game thing makes almost no sense to me. And I got to the first boss, but nothing I do damages it. I never played the original, so I was just going by the hype and the newly reduced price. Oh well.",

It's worth a download though, if you like weird $#!T. If you've never played Puzzle Fighter, I recommend this one. It's my personal favorite puzzle game and the online works great.",

            "17. Posted: Thu 21st May 2009 19:00 BST @Adam Same here. I tried Bionic Commando and was immediately having a hard time with the controls. I'm not used to having to rely on the arm so much. I stopped playing since I had also downloaded a few other games. That's why I feel I should have waited before buying it at the full price. I heard they were going to release a trophy patch for it so I decided to wait until that happens before trying the game again. I'm sure it just takes a lot of practice before you get a good feel for the game. This was also my first Bionic Commando game. Edited on Thu 21st May, 2009 @ 19:01 by SilentJ",
