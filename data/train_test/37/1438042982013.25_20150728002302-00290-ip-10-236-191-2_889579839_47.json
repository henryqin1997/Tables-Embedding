            "Campus Police are constantly on watch and active. There are security stations located in key-points throughout campus keeping everyone safe with a sense of security.",
            "Highly active, more Fraternities and Sororities than I can name. I'm not too intersted in Greek Life but there are many events hosted by the different clubs all week.",
            "Activities and events are always being planned and acted out, such as with the Dance club. just about every week or so any student could attend a play, concert of special lunch event. Most On campus events are free for all students and present a pleasant break from studying and academics.",
            "Great for students who love to have fun, but not so much into Partying. although there are plenty of events and parties, there are seldom any loud or earthshaking events. Campus is usually quite and peaceful. and from an Academic standing the school, its classes and curriculum are best geared toward students perusing Degree's in Science and Pharmacy and offers many opportunists to expose students real to work environments.",
            "Ooze ball - yes it is about as nasty as it sounds, imagine playing volleyball waist deep in what is basically an enormous mud puddle. its extremely fun though. I don't know if many other schools have it but i definitely will remind you that your are about as far south as it gets.",
            "tuition in comparison to many other schools of the same prestige is drastically cheaper and affordable. Not only is most of your tuition paid for by Pell Grant but the access to the facilities and technology greatly present relief. The Library offers almost 24 hour assistance for both academic an personal use.",
            "Personally, exploring all the foods and technologies on campus is enough to keep on one person pretty excited and busy. in addition the campus offers and Activity Center where students can play/practice different sports, join aerobic, lift weights and do many entertaining things.",
            "ULM has been renounced in the city for its food and being open to the public. Starbucks is also conveniently located on campus next to Dorms. Campus itself is also surrounded with a wealth of local restaurants and stores.",
            "Dorm life is admittedly lacking in some facilities, but budget in these faculties are expected before taking away academics, however given the best accommodations some dorms are surprisingly luxurious giving very much security and freedom.",
            "Academic life like many other colleges is almost self-paced. You handle your own work load and are perfectly free to manage a schedule to allot time for school and personal life.",
            "Make very good use on online and on-campus Resources, You are provided with many accommodations that were included in tuition fee's that should be taken full advantage of to make school easier",
            "There are lots of events and opportunities. Instructed are highly trained in their respective fields and willing to work with students. National Standing is great, despite economic budget cuts, school still runs smoothly and is very well managed."

Tips for prospective students College is a great experience... just do not forget why you are here. Reading in your textbooks is a major bonus. Also, utilize your teacher/professor's office hours. (: Bang for the buck It is definitely a bang for your buck. You get access to everything: activity center, student success center, tutors, etc. Am enjoying being here I no longer live on campus but I still enjoy being on campus as much as I did when I was living on campus. Campus life is always buzzing. Am learning a lot The professors are extremely helpful with making sure you know the material. Most classrooms on campus are equipped with smart boards and other high tech equipment so you're not just hearing the information, you can see it as well.
