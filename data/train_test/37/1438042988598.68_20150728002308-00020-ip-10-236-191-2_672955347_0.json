    "textAfterTable": "Full Table Fixtures Nottingham (7) vs Rotherham Titans (51) - Championship Sunday March 9th - KO 1:00pm - View Photos Pre-Match Report Ahead of the important Greene King IPA Championship Round 18 clash, Titans Lee Blackett has made just two changes to the side that narrowly lost at home to Bristol last week in front of the Sky Sports cameras. The one change in the backline sees flying winger Curtis Wilson come back into contention for Jamie Broadley, whilst in the pack Ali Birch comes into the back row for the injured and inspirational Alfie To\u2019oala. At this stage of the season most teams have picked up a number of injuries and the Titans are no different. Unavailable for selection this week due to injury are Alfie To'oala (hamstring), Ed Williamson (ribs) and Tom Cruse (ankle), with Rotherham also unable to call on long-term injury casualties Ben Thomas, Sam Heygate, Laurence Pearce and Barney Maddison. Lee Blackett however is quite philosophical about the growing injury list at Clifton Lane, as he explained, \u201cWe\u2019ve always said if we want to have any ambitions of a top four spot we need to be lucky with injuries and I still believe we have a good enough squad to win games at this level. The majority of our key performers are all",
