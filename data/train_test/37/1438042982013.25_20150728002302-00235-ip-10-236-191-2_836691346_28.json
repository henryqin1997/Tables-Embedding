Dana N. | 08/12/2013 Read Full Review Wonderful getaway! My husband and I recently stayed in this unit for a weekend beach getaway. The studio was clean and well equipped to meet our needs. We were told that the unit did not overlook the beach, but were pleasantly surprised to find that the balcony did give us a view of the gulf! The complimentary chairs and umbrella made our trips to the beach hassle",
