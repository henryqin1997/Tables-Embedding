Preferably, the administrator system 3 generally operates automatically under the supervision of the administrator 5. For reasons that will become clear, when the present invention is practiced in the United States, the administrator is preferably a broker/dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \ufffd 78a et seq., and an investment advisor registered under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \ufffd 80a et seq., 59173=The registration form also includes a user-friendly form for opening a securities account for the purchase, receipt and ownership of securities, such as shares of the fund of the present invention. When the present invention is practiced in the United States, the fund, which preferably is a mutual fund, and its shares are preferably registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq, respectively. The member, via the registration form, preferably provides the administrator with standing instructions to receive rebate monies earned by the member and invest such rebate monies in the fund., 88940=The fund provides no investment return in this example since the above is a \u201cday one\u201d scenario. If, for example, the value of the above stocks were to increase by 10%, the value of the overall portfolio would grow to $1320 and the value of each individual account would grow to $440. Also note that while Max purchased nothing from Sharper Image, he is nevertheless an owner of Sharper Image via the fund. As discussed above, if the administrator receives rebate monies from a private merchant, it preferably invests the monies as a function of the fund's then existing portfolio. Thus, in this example, if the administrator were to receive $120 in rebate monies from private merchants, such rebate monies would be invested as follows: $50 in Amazon, $30 in CDNow, and $40 in Sharper Image.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes While the invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments, it is evident that numerous alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description. For example, while in the preferred embodiments, the database server 10 c automatically updates its stored information to reflect member purchases, rebate monies owed to and received by the administrator, and information relating to the member's accounts and the find, the administrator may gather some or all of this information via other means and input such information into the database server 10 c. Moreover, many of the administrator functions described above in connection with the e-commerce and credit card embodiments may be outsourced by the administrator. For example, the tracking of member purchases, the billing of merchants for rebate monies, and the receipt of such rebate monies may be performed by an entity under the general direction of the administrator. Moreover, the administration of the escrow account that holds the rebate monies may be outsourced. In such cases, the relevant system information is provided (preferably electronically) to the administrator, inputted into the database server 10 c, and maintained in the database server 10 c. As can now be seen, this credit card embodiment gives the members greater flexibility as to how (either off-line or on-line) and where they purchase products and services, while still providing a diversified investment",
