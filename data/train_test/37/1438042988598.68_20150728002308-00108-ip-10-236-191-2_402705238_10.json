You're kind of making an excuse for Canon which I don't think we need to do. The 7D is weather sealed as is the Nikon D7000 and both have popup flashes. Neither have articulating screens though. Maybe that's a durability issue. Dave Swivel screen = durability risk, could break much easier than fixed LCD Pop up flash = durability risk, reduces sealing Remember the 6D is a relatively expensive camera and is built, in large part, for durability.
