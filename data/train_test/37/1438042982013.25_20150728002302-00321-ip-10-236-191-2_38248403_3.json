By default, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is used for fitting. While often criticized, including the fact it finds a local minima, this approach has some distinct advantages. These include being fast, and well-behaved for most curve-fitting needs, and making it easy to estimate uncertainties for and correlations between pairs of fit variables, as discussed in Goodness-of-Fit and estimated uncertainty and correlations. Choosing Different Fitting Methods\u00b6 is also a reasonable approach. Similarly, one could place bounds on the decay parameter to take values only between -pi/2 and pi/2. period = sign(period)*1.e-10 if abs(period) < 1.e-10:  but putting this directly in the function with:   params['period'] = Parameter(value=2, min=1.e-10)  In this example,",
    "textAfterTable": "Note The objective function for the Levenberg-Marquardt method must return an array, with more elements than variables. All other methods can return either a scalar value or an array. Warning Much of this documentation assumes that the Levenberg-Marquardt method is the method used. Many of the fit statistics and estimates for uncertainties in parameters discussed in Goodness-of-Fit and estimated uncertainty and correlations are done only for this method. Goodness-of-Fit and estimated uncertainty and correlations\u00b6 On a successful fit using the leastsq method, several goodness-of-fit statistics and values related to the uncertainty in the fitted variables will be calculated. These are all encapsulated in the Minimizer object for the fit, as returned by minimize(). The values related to the entire fit are stored in attributes of the Minimizer object, as shown in Table of Fit Results while those related to each fitted variables are stored as attributes of the corresponding Parameter.
