Mourning continued playing after kidney transplant surgery in 2003, and won a championship with Miami in 2006., 12715=The Bills signed Jones as an undrafted rookie in 2010. He was good enough to make the team and earn a regular role on what eventually became known as Buffalo's \"No-Name Offense\" of castoffs and journeymen led by quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick., 5951=In this Dec. 11, 2013 photo provided by New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Donald Jones, left, poses with his surgeon, Dr. Gerald Appel, at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New York, before being released. Jones, who played wide receiver for the Buffalo Bills and New England Patriots, fought kidney disease since college, was a kidney transplant on December 3, with an organ donated by his father. With little chance of returning to professional football, Jones is considering a stab at one in baseball after some rehab and recovery time. (AP Photo/New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Charles Manley), 11641=Jones had surgery Dec. 3 and was released from hospital Wednesday with a good prognosis for a full recovery., 13582=After being cut by the Bills in February, Jones signed with New England. It was during a visit with kidney specialist Gerald Appel last summer when the severity of Jones' condition was fully revealed. His kidney functions had deteriorated to a level where the only options were a transplant or dialysis., 7253=In this Dec. 11, 2013 photo provided by New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Donald Jones, left, poses with his surgeon, Dr. Gerald Appel, at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New York, before being released. Jones, who played wide receiver for the Buffalo Bills and New England Patriots, received a kidney transplant on December 3. Although his football career is likely over, Jones now hopes to return to professional sports and play baseball. (AP Photo/New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Charles Manley), 8458=In this Dec. 11, 2013 photo provided by New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Donald Jones, left, poses with his surgeon, Dr. Gerald Appel, at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New York, before being released. Jones, who played wide receiver for the Buffalo Bills and New England Patriots, needed a transplant after disease permanently damaged his kidneys. On December 3, Apple and a surgical team replaced his damaged organs with a kidney donated by Jones\u2019 father. Jones will probably never play professional football again but he may pursue one in Major League Baseball after a period of recovery and rehabilitation. (AP Photo/New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Charles Manley), 12992=As a rookie, Jones had 18 catches for 213 yards and a touchdown in 15 games, including five starts. He finished with 82 catches for 887 yards and six touchdowns in 35 games over three years before the protein levels leaking from his kidneys began to spike. Jones was placed on Buffalo's reserve/nonfootball illness list in December.}",
