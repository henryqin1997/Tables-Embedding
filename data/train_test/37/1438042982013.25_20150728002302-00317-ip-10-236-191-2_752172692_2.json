    "textBeforeTable": "The Canon Speedlite 320EX Flash uses 4 AA batteries (same as the 430EX II, the 270EX II uses 2). Note that batteries are not included in the weight specifications below - use NiMH rechargeable batteries for both cost, environmental and performance reasons. I use and recommend Sanyo Eneloop batteries for their long-lasting performance and especially for their slow discharge properties. All dimensions below are WxHxD. The ST-E2 is not a flash but a flash transmitter - it requires a 2CR5 lithium battery. The Canon Speedlite 320EX Flash features the higher grade hot shoe locking mechanism of the 430EX II and 580EX II. Overall build quality is very good. The extending portion of the flash head has some flex, but I'm not bothered by it. No sound can be heard during 320EX charging. As with the 270EX II, a 2-position (24mm, 50mm) manual zoom option allows the Canon Speedlite 320EX Flash's light to be concentrated on the framed subject - making more efficient use of its power and extending its useful distance. Unlike with the 270EX II, both zoom settings can be used in any of the bounce orientations. Great things can be done with bounce flash - learn to use it. Simply twist the head to the direction you wish to bounce light from. Here is why: When shooting in portrait/vertical orientation, the camera grip is going to be on top - or to the right if I'm shooting with",
    "textAfterTable": "Canon Speedlite 580EX Flash 13.2 oz (375g) 3.0 x 5.3 x 4.5\" (76 x 134 x 114mm) The height of a flash helps the light physically clear large and wide angle lenses when the flash is directed straight forward. This helps eliminate the dark half-moon commonly seen at the bottom of images taken with the built-in flash and moderate-sized or larger lenses. The 320EX has considerably more height than the 270EX II. Height also helps reduce the red-eye effect.
