Luxor XUL and Mozilla XUL just follow different goals that lead to different designs. Put simply Luxor tries to reuse some hand-picked Mozilla XUL goodies.) Luxor XUL != Mozilla XUL. Luxor XUL doesn't strive to be a 100 % Mozilla XUL clone. Instead Luxor XUL tries to add more value to XUL through a built-in web server, portal engine or template engine, for example. How does Luxor XUL differ from Mozilla XUL? Get Involved. Join a winning team; see How To Help Out And Contribute for getting started today. Bernhard works for AGIS mbH (Allianz Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Informatik Service mbH) and writes the monthly Linux Magazin \"Java Coffee-Shop\" column.
