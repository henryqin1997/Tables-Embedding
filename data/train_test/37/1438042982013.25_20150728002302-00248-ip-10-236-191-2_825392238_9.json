The exercises in the bowling workout plan specifically target the areas of the body bowlers use most and with the ideal set and repetition variables to promote strength gains. Bowling Complete Body WorkoutThe bowling workout plan has two routines. The first workout is a complete body workout for improving strength. The bowling workout begins with 15 minutes on the elliptical trainer, which adequately warms up the muscles and burns calories. The bowling complete body workout has exercises for the upper and lower body. Two exercises, squats and power snatches, are done as pyramid sets. Pyramid training involves changing the repetitions on each set for ideal strength adaptations. In this workout, bowlers do four sets with 10 reps in the first set, then eight, six, and four reps in subsequent sets. The bowling complete body workout also includes two sets of 12 to 16 lunges, which works the thighs and glutes.
