BUY IT, instead of the poser rock out there in abundance.. this is the real deal. thank you mr. steve vai \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by answers live \"for the love of god\" i have been \"whispering a prayer\" for the rest of the wild things songs to be on itunes and my prayers have been \"answers\" thank you itunes and thank you mr. steve vai aka god of the guitar for the great music. One of the best concerts EVER.......period!",
