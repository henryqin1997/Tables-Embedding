The \u2018Dogs and the Eagles have found themselves in familiar territory; in the top 8 and in elite company. The Eagles might be under a bit of pressure when it comes to the latter after winning just 1 from their past 4, but they still sit 4th on the ladder and still own the 2nd best defensive record in the NRL. The Bulldogs are winners of 6 from their last 7, sitting 7th., 13772=Father time is a horrible, horrible beast and this bastard does not relent in ageing some of our finest footballers. If that last sentence made any sense, please email me back and explain it to me. 8 years ago, Benji Marshall and Scott Prince were at the peak of their powers and together, brought the rugby league world to a standstill when they destroyed the dreams of a star-studded Dragons club and went on to win the 2005 NRL premiership., 18539=The Knights. Oh dear. They\u2019ve lost 5 of their past 6 matches and watching them last week, it seemed like the mercenaries bought in by Wayne Bennett may have lost their mojo. Beau Scott, Neville Costigan and Jeremy Smith may have won a competition with Bennett\u2019s Dragons in 2010, but their toughness in defense seems to have slipped a little. Playing at home against the struggling red V last week, they didn't look good. Or confident., 20085=South Sydney are elite. Adam Reynolds has the control and patience of a Greg Alexander or Ricky Stuart circa 1991. He kicks beautifully, defends bravely and gets his forwards and backs the ball at the right times. Not a line breaker as were the aforementioned legends of Rugby League but the game has surely changed since then. Now that the Adam Reynolds fan club meeting is over, Souths defense is the difference here and they run away late.}",
