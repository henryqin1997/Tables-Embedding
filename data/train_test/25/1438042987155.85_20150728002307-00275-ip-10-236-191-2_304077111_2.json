Transfer News (Tuesday July 28 2015), 27827=We at Vital Villa like to think that we look after our members during credit crunches so we have a buy one Toffee, get a second free. So hot on the heals of Holroyds answers, we've got fellow Vital Everton editor Dominic Fitzpatrick answering some questions ahead of this weekends game. 1) So how has the season been so far? I think we have to say it's been disappointing so far, even if we are in seventh. We have had opportunities already to be well up in the top five and we just haven't taken them. A slow start to the season seems to have sped up a little but the league is so tight that even a few drawn games could see us drop into the bottom half, it's the most competitive it's been in a long time! 2) With everthing so open in the league, if you win you'd go equal with us for example, where do you see Everton ending up? I really don't know, I think there are two sides to this Everton team, the side you saw against Tottenham, highly resilient, workmanlike, and the side you saw against Wigan, clueless and devoid of inspiration. If we see the side that beat Tottenham more often this season then anything's possible, even another top five finish. However such was the abysmal display against Wigan if we see more of this then we could be dragged into the mire, oh to be an Evertonian! Never without it's thrills! 3) Has the credit crunch ruined your chances of investment and if so, just how badly are Everton being held up by the seemingly (?) decent but money strapped board? I really don't know what to think about this board. We have Bill Kenwright, an avid Blue, who apparently has the best interests of the club at heart. (Even if this means uprooting the club and moving them outside of the City much to many Evertonian's annoyance. I recently read that not one member of the Everton board had invested in the club and that most of the investment which has been put into David Moyes' squad was from bank loans and debt consolidation, yet if Everton does get sold to a rich investor, the money will go to the current board members and shareholders. Anyways... I think any investor is being massively put off by the fact that the Club desperately need a new home. We are apparently faced with a decision, sell our soul and mov to Kirkby into a mid-range stadium part funded by Tesco and increase our attractiveness to potential investors, or stay at Goodison Park and continue to lose ground both financially and from a footballing sense on our closest rivals, which includes yourselves. 4) What - if anything - do you think about Aston Villa and Martin O'Neill? Massive respect, I like Villa a lot. Lots of talent, good manager, good owner, good fans. Other than ourselves I would love to see the top four toppled by Aston Villa. O'Neill has shown you don't need to spend megabucks to put together a quality side, a mission our manager has been on ever since the beginning of his tenure. Good coaching and good management, as demonstrated by Villa and Everton, counts for a lot. 5) The press and managers such as Sir Alex Chewalot say that Villa are the most likely to break the top four, what do you think about that then Mr Toffee!? I think it's a very fair point. Villa already have a quality side and Mr. Lerner will undoubtedly allow MO to add to this in January. It's much harder for Everton though, and I have to say if we managed to finish above you in fifth again it would be a tremendous achievement. 6) If you could have one player of ours, who would it be and why? Interesting! I think Gareth Barry would be a welcome addition to any Premier League team. Ashley Young is exactly what Everton are crying out for, a pacy wideman, but I have to say I'm a huge fan of Gabby Agbonlahor. 7) Who would you send in the opposite direction? No one! Give us all three for nothing! 8) And a prediction if you would be so kind?! I really look forward to these ties as I think Everton produce their better football and results against teams in and around their level. So I'm going to say 1-0 Everton, goal scored by number 25, MAROUANE FELLAINI... YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!
