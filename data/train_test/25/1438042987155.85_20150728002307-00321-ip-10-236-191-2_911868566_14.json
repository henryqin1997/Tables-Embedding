            "If you ever need a ride from somewhere on campus, especially late at night whether you're drunk or just flat out scared you can call the escort service and they'll come pick you up, no questions asked and no consequences. Emergency phones in front of every dorm including the feats and sororities, all you do is push a button and it can still hear you from up to 20 feet away!",
            "So fun, not like what everyone says. All of the frats and sororities are really nice. And of course beta has the best parties and dance floor.",
            "Over 120 different clubs to join or you can just create your own.",
            "The kissing bridge, Don't step on the seal in the hollow. And of course streaking the hollow if you do step on the seal, or just for fun.",
            "Streak the hollow, hang out in founders pizza bar and grill, or post 95 coffee shop. Or just walk around, there's also the lounge in the basement of the student center dopplegangers.",
            "Make sure you feel comfortable wherever you choose to live and go over your course list the first day you arrive so you're not taking unnecessary courses.",
            "One of the best liberal arts colleges you could attend. Challenging classes that really make you have to think and consider things. It's really easy to connect with your professors and fellow students, everyone is always willing to help with anything you need."

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Students who enjoy being active and getting involved. Tips for prospective students Talk to your professors and get to know as many people as you can. The good thing about going to a small school like Wittenberg is that you have a chance to become close to a variety of people. Most people get involved in sororities or fraturnities or are active on sports teams. Bang for the buck Even though the tuition is very expensive financial aid is available. Did enjoy being here There are many activities on campus at all times. It is easy to get involved. Did learn a lot Professors are willing to help students and always available to anwser questions.
