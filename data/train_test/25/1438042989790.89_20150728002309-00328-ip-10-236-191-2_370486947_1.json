It isn't impressive in the face of Retina Display, 1080p, and other higher-pixel-density displays, but it matches the basic resolution of a small laptop.

It's an official mini trend in Windows 8 PCs. View full gallery (9 Photos) Sarah Tew/CNET This 11-inch ultraportable laptop is cute, well-constructed in largely brushed aluminum, and, yes, pretty sexy. It's got the style of HP's small dm-series laptops, and a blend of a small-business and a personal feel about it, much like Apple continually pulls off. It feels better-built than some competing models, and has a similar heft and discreet portability to the",
