Either advertised or you just try to connect to some hotel and it works. 2\u00b0 Internet cafes ~ 1 Baht/min They are everywhere, haven't tried rural areas though... 3\u00b0 (Some) places you stay ~ you pay 50 Baht, get receipt with username, password and 2 hours, which you can use through the day. 4\u00b0 3G: buy sim card for 50 Baht, load it with 350 Baht, insert it in your netbook (mine has 3G module built in, alternatively you need usb dongle). Metered on volume, good for checking email and light surfing only, should last for 5-6 hours. Or you can put sim card in your phone and have a local number. 5\u00b0 3G: got to phone shop, buy sim card for 50 Baht, choose a monthly plan, there are several, (I have chosen 100 hours for 350 Baht), unlimited for a month costs ~ 1000 Baht. 6\u00b0 In many areas there are commercial wi-fi providers: you see a strong signal, connect, type http://1.1.1.1 and you will be presented with different plans: daily, weekly, monthly. (unlimited monthly ~ up to 2000 Baht) 3G connection (5\u00b0 and 6\u00b0) is VERY slow, not for Skype or uploading pictures. (I am using AIS provider, in 10 days my month is over, will take another provider and post results). The rest is bearable, ~ 2 MB/min Initially posted it on my blog but Travelfish is a more appropriate place for this. http://aleshnikov.blogspot.com/2009/10/internet-access-in-thailand.html, 4622=#11 Posted: 12/10/2012 - 11:42, 11085=#5 Posted: 13/10/2009 - 09:32, 7223=#8 Posted: 13/10/2009 - 18:45, 5593=#10 Posted: 23/4/2012 - 16:40, 10003=#6 Posted: 13/10/2009 - 10:16, 8954=Joined Travelfish 26th March, 2008 Location Singapore Posts: 131, 10784=admin Joined Travelfish 21st January, 2004 Location Indonesia Posts: 7221 Total reviews: 24 Places visited: At least 113, 12159=#4 Posted: 13/10/2009 - 01:12, 13552=Joined Travelfish 21st October, 2006 Posts: 730 Total reviews: 4 Places visited: At least 67, 13157=#3 Posted: 13/10/2009 - 00:22, 8456=#7 Posted: 13/10/2009 - 18:30, 4969=Joined Travelfish 29th September, 2012 Posts: 58, 14313=#2 Posted: 12/10/2009 - 23:00, 6026=Joined Travelfish 13th August, 2008 Posts: 386, 12590=Joined Travelfish 11th April, 2009 Location United Kingdom Posts: 55 Total reviews: 7, 15593=#1 Posted: 12/10/2009 - 22:41, 6428=#9 Posted: 23/4/2012 - 09:16}",
