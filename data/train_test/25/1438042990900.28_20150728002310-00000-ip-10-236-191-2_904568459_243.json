            "If you want to do research, this is the school for you! You can apply for a research grant twice a year for fall or spring. If you love the outdoors there are many parks, as well as other opportunities such as cycling, boating, fishing, and hunting. If you are interested in agriculture, the St. Paul Campus offers many different programs and facilities. If you are interested in veterinary science, we have the world renown Raptor Center.",
            "There are lots of sporting events and the Student Activities office usually has discounted tickets to all kinds of local events like sports, movies, museums and more. Coffman Memorial Union is home to most Student Groups and it also has a game room in the basement where you can bowl. There's a huge gym on East Bank and another at St. Paul Campus, both have exercise machines and swimming available. Lots of buses run through campus so it's easy to catch a bus to head into Minneapolis to eat out, drink, or club.",
            "There are lots of places to eat at the University, whether you go to Dinkytown or just stay on campus. There are flexible meal plan options you can buy that allow you to eat at Dormitory Halls, at participating restaurants, or both. Food can be pricey at Coffman Memorial Union, so if I'm in that area I just eat at one of the restaurants along Washington Ave. Also, coffee shops can be found scattered around campus and in most of the major libraries.",
            "I am a commuter student but I have heard that dorm life is pretty good on campus but with no personal experience I rated three stars.",
            "Post Secondary classes are more rigorous than High School classes by far, and difficulty also depends on what you're majoring in and the elective classes you take. I am a Social Science Major so on average, my grades are largely based on tests, assignments, and papers. Reading: 1-3 hours a week per class Writing: I would spend between 4 -15+ hours strictly writing a paper (not counting research time). Less hours if regular papers and classes, more hours for final papers and writing intensive classes. Total class time: Anywhere from 6 - 20 hours a week (includes lab and lectures)",
            "Every credit after 13 credits is free, however I would not recommend taking more than 15 or 16, especially if you are taking Upper Division classes! For transfer students, you do not need to do more than 13 credits a semester to graduate on time. Be aware that some classes are only offered during Spring or Fall semesters, and some are only offered every other year (i.e. odd years or even years) so plan ahead of time.",
            "The University of Minnesota is a great research school, with many knowledgeable instructors, and state-of-the-art equipment. There are many opportunities to socialize including: student groups, athletics, volunteering, and campus events. Post Secondary education is expensive but the University has many scholarships and other opportunities to help make it more affordable!"

However, make sure to apply before the priority deadline, usually in early December. Look up additional scholarships on the website., 43041=It is best to apply early to the University, usually before their priority deadline in mid December. Your application will be viewed early and as a result given a better chance to be accepted into your college of choice and potential for University scholarships. After choosing to attend to the U of M, it is definitely worth it to live in the dorms for the first year. In the dorms, you have the opportunity to meet alot of people while getting adjusted to campus life. Also, don't worry if you are nervous. Everyone else is in the same boat you are. Just be yourself and be open to new things. It is definitely beneficial to go to class. It may be tempting to just skip some classes, but you will likely find that you will miss more material that you imagined. Also, don't be afraid to meet your professors. They actually like to get to know their students and it can come in handy later when you need a reference or letter of recommendation. Finally, get involved! You will have fun doing something you like while also meeting people. These people may become great friends later on or lead you to someone who can help you down the road in life., 147194=I can't think of a single student who found the academic rigor at the U of M to be lacking. Some courses will naturally be easier than others (especially 1000-level ones); however, those will be worth fewer credit hours in order to reflect that. Also worth iterating is the fact that the common misconception of science and math classes being more difficult is not necessarily true here; as a foreign language major, I can attest to the fact that As are not just handed out willy-nilly. All subject areas require work; there are no easy majors\u00e2??., 999561=The University of Minnesota is a very good school, it is ranked one of the top 10 research universities when I started attending in 2005. The classes are quite large and so you would need to develop a very healthy studying schedule to keep up with course work. That or you can visit the professors during office hours., 36546=The class content depends a bit on what the class is. Especially for first-year classes (1000 level), there are the joke classes that only require a bit of realizing what the professor wants. Good news (maybe...?), however, is that this changes a lot with higher level courses (starting even with the 2000 level ones). All of my professors so far do know their material; when signing up for classes during orientation, try to get into more advanced classes and to pick professors that have won the Morse Award or some other designation. All of that said, what someone learns depends mostly on that person's effort put into the class., 413694=On the East Bank of the Minneapolis campus we have the Weisman Art Museum. This building stands out from any other building on campus because of its postmodern architecture. It was just reopened in the fall of 2011 after it underwent a major expansion project. The museum now has many more works of art on display than it ever had before., 929488=I'd definitely give the University a 9.5 out of 10. I've actually been living here since the beginning of June and honestly I feel welcomed everyday I'm here. The University of Minnesota is full of fun, energetic, and friendly people that make up the rate 9.5, 347397=just a warning: the light rail won't be done until 2015 which blocks off all of washington ave., 770830=There's lots of cheap dates. There's a telescope on the physics building that is free to use after 8 o'clock and they show free movies in one of the buildings before the movies come out on video., 1062419=There are crime alerts that go on and it is very convenient that the university will text you on your phone and email you. Also you can call someone walk with you at night if you feel unsafe, you just call an escort. In addition there is the Gopher Chauffeur that takes calls till 2:00 AM., 929067=If you want to get into the University of Minnesota feel proud. The U of MN had 43,000 applicants for the incoming class of 2017, and only 5500 applicants were accepted. Definitely take your application seriously and meet every deadline.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students The U of M is a school for every type of student. Seriously, it might sound cliche, but whether you are all about studying and keeping the grades up in hopes to go far, or are just testing the waters and taking some classes, coming back from years off of school, or just winging it... there are a million more students just like you and life on and around campus has stuff for everyone :) Tips for prospective students I was so scared as an incoming freshman, because nobody from my high school or town lived in the cities, so I thought I would never meet anyone. Believe me, when you get to school it is so easy to meet and get along with everyone on campus, and you can't let yourself worry for one second. Everyone is in the exact same boat as you are, and it will all go way more smoothly than you might be scared of. So just don't worry and have fun with it, because it is a serious step in life, but the U of M makes it so much fun and so easy to meet people, and you won't be alone at all, because you'll make such good friends even the first day you're on campus! Bang for the buck",
