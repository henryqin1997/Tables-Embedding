It has been certified platinum in the United States. He became the first artist to have seven songs from a debut record to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. Bieber released his first full-length studio album, My World 2.0, in March 2010. It debuted at or near number one in several countries and was certified platinum in the United States. It was preceded by the single, \"Baby\", which is also, as of July 2014, the YouTube video with the most dislikes, and the most views on a Vevo platform. Justin Drew Bieber is a Canadian singer and songwriter. Bieber's current manager, Scooter Braun, first discovered him through his YouTube videos in 2007. Braun, as noted, was impressed with the videos resulting in contacting Bieber's mother, Patricia Mallette, about wanting to work with his musical abilities. Moreover, him having convinced his mother, Braun arranged for Bieber to meet with singer-songwriter, Usher, in Atlanta, Georgia. As a result, Bieber was signed to RBMG, a record label based in Atlanta, then to Island Records -- part of Def Jam Records -- with a recording contract offered by a prominent record executive, L.A. Reid. About the artist",
