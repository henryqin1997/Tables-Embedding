To the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications and similar arrangements as would be apparent to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the scope of the appended claims should be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and similar arrangements. [0104] According to one embodiment, to overcome the problem, the cache sharing group for each AMF is configured so that it does not include geographically remote AMFs. [0103] Whether or not it is successful, the request for the page from remote cache is wasteful of the wide area bandwidth. [0102] The additional transport latency of accessing remote cache reduces the potential \u201cwin\u201d of a remote cache hit. [0101] By virtue of locality of reference, the page is much less likely to be in the geographically remote AMF's cache. [0100] If the cache sharing group for a given block range includes AMFs that are separated over geography, there is the risk of wasting bandwidth for remote cache read requests. More precisely, the risk is that when a local AMF discovers that a given page is not in his own cache",
