No. 5,664,422, issued Sep. 9, 1997, herein incorporated by reference. As is generally described therein, the patented method involves delivering flavored liquid dairy and other alimentary compositions to a feed tray and then dripping the composition into a freezing chamber. The feed tray comprises a plurality of orifices through which liquid composition passes so that droplets form and fall into the freezing chamber. Each orifice may also have a corresponding feed dropper which is downwardly disposed in relation to the tray such that the liquid composition passes from the tray through an orifice and then through an associated feed dropper where a droplet is formed. The orifices or combination of orifices and feed droppers will hereinafter be referred to collectively as feed assemblies.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing description has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Obvious modifications or variations are possible in light of the above teachings. The embodiment or embodiments discussed were chosen and described to provide the best illustration of the principles of the invention and its practical application to thereby enable one of ordinary skill in the art to utilize the invention in various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. All such modifications and variations are within the scope of the invention as determined by the appended claims when interpreted in accordance with the breadth to which they are fairly and legally entitled. Additionally, improperly frozen liquid composition represents waste which must be screened and removed from the uniform beaded product prior to packaging. This waste and the processes associated with removing the waste from the desired product, e.g. operation of separation devices, decreases production efficiency. The present invention eliminates this waste. By use of the novel gas diffusion chamber and vacuum assembly, the need for a separation requirement is successfully eliminated, thus the prior art screening components and the power utilized to operate them are no longer required. Numerous benefits result from the use of the improved invention. In contrast to prior art designs where the freezing of liquid composition in",
