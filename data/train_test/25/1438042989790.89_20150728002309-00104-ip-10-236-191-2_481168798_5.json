The specification and drawings should be considered exemplary only, and the scope of the invention is accordingly intended to be limited only by the following claims and equivalents thereof. After switching to the parallel channel, the wireless device 502 communicates information with the other wireless device over a corresponding direct link at step 606. When the end time indicated in the corresponding channel schedule lapses, the direct link module 510 switches the wireless device 502 back to the base channel by tuning the transceiver 504 to the base channel at step 608. Once back on the base channel, the wireless device 502 may communicate uplink, downlink and/or peer-to-peer information with the access point 110 via the base channel at step 610. Steps 604, 606 and/or 608 may be repeated any number of times based on the channel schedules associated with the beacon interval. Moreover, the steps 602-610 may be repeated for the next beacon interval using the same channel schedules or using updated channel schedules received from, for example, the access point 110. At step 604, the wireless device 502 switches its direct link to a parallel channel by tuning the transceiver 504 to the parallel",
