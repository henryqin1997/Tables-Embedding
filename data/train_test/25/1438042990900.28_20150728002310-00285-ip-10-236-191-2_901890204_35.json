You make the college; college doesnt make you! Tips for prospective students This is my second semester in college and being here has opened my eyes up to a lot of opportunites. Just being in college over all has really showed me a lot about not only myself but just the world itself. It has showed me a great number of things so far and I just have a whole new perspective on life itself now and even with the things and people around me. I really recommend that if you have the chance and opportunity to go to college, then go for it. Don't let that chance pass you by! Login to rate or flag the reviews",
