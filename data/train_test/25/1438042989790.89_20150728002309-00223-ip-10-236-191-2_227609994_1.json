Category: None Group: None Status: Open Resolution: None Priority: 5 Private: No Submitted By: Mike Solomon (organdiae) Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Summary: include directive and parsed literals Initial Comment: With Docutils >= 0.9, it is impossible to include HTML files (without parsing of rst-inline-markup in the HTML file) with the \"include\" directive:: .. include:: test.html :code: HTML It would be nice to have a new option for the include directive that allowed one to pass the content of the included file to a \"parsed literal\" block. Something like: .. include:: test.html :parsed-literal: HTML",
