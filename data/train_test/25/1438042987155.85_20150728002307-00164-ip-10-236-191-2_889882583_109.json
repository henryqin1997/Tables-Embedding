            "VSU has its own police force and they constantly watch over the campus. While very few crimes are committed, they continue to make students feel safe.",
            "You will constantly see sororities and fraternities wanting to recruit and you will always see them hosting fun events.",
            "VSU is all about clubs (sororities and fraternities too). Almost everyday there is an activity going around. The businesses around Valdosta love to host events on campus, as well.",
            "people who enjoy: party life, dorm life, traveling, greek life",
            "Over all, this school is great for people wanting a genuine college experience and education. VSU doesn't hand out diplomas unless your advisers feel you have earned it.",
            "While Valdosta is a military town, it's also a college one. It can get boring if you don't like drinking or going out to eat at restaurants with friends. There is Wild Adventures theme park on the outskirts of town, but other than that, going to Atlanta (a 5 hour drive north) or Jacksonville or Tallahassee (both around 2 hours away south) will be your sources of fun.",
            "The prices aren't bad and it is cheaper if you buy a meal plan or take advantage of their promos to put VSU bucks on your account and get extra dollars for free. The campus has a wide variety of food selections such as: Nathan's hotdogs, Chic-fil-a, Starbucks, a buffet style dining hall, Moe's Southwestern Grill, Pizza hut, a yogurt shop, and more restaurants in the admissions building.",
            "VSU offers buses to get around campus and shuttles to take you to a near by Walmart and the Mall shopping area (both are within 5 miles of the campus). The rooms are decently sized as well. Just remember that it is a college and there will parties/drinking involved with the bars only 1 mile away.",
            "The professors at this campus are wonderful. They always make sure everyone is on the same page and they stop to explain things when questions are asked. They do their best to prepare students to pass their classes.",
            "Don't be afraid to ask questions - the campus is very friendly with hardly any crimes. Would recommend this campus!",
            "Great, clean school. Experienced, professional professors. Knowledgeable, friendly staff in every office."

I have had the pleasure of visiting the campus and it is very pretty. The dorms are nice and they have a lot for you to do on campus. The campus itself is easy to get around and is convenient for those like me, who don't have a car. So far, the faculty that I came in contact with are very friendly and helpful. I am satisfied with VSU so far and I look forward to attending., 226831=Relay for Life, March of Dimes, Car washes, Community service and soooo much more., 231751=YOU GO TO SCHOOL 5:30 TO 10:15 AND YOU GET YOUR CLASSES DONE IN 8 WEEKS. ITS A GREAT WAY TO GET AHEAD!!, 563444=I love the campus! Really small city though, not much to do. Weather is okay, it can get real hot in august/september.. I mean REAL hot., 336934=A big tradition here at Valdosta State is Breast Cancer Awareness, as well as No-Shave November. Join in on the many activities and become a part of a wonderful community., 437968=Wild Adventures is a theme park that is located about 15 minutes from campus. We even get to go one day during Homecoming week in October., 93016=We call November No shave November you can infer from that what you can, 257019=I don' t know much about the dining halls, but the food in the student union is great! Currently there is Nathan's and Starbucks to choose from, but we're suppose to be getting a Chick Fil A come August of 2012., 551269=There are a variety of food options. The dining halls, however, seem very repetitive. It always the same things in different forms everyday. Also, not too many healthy options except for the salad bar and fruits. Though, in January 2014, there will be renovations done in the hall to include more healthy eating options that seems promising.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Valdosta State's staff is about as friendly a group of people as you will find anywhere else. I am in my second year here, and I feel more confident about reaching my goals every day. Being an Honors student, I worried about the potential workload. Every single one of my classes has been thought-provoking, challenging (at times), and most definately rewarding.

Tips for prospective students Do not stay in your dorm all the time, of course you are supposed to come to college to get an education but it is supposed to be memorable!",
