    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{36907=It looks like Uitkijk #11 & #12 have been drilled in May 2011 and the 5 well drilling program in the Coronie block is underway. http://www.staatsolie.com/pdf/nieuws_juli_final.pdf Evaluation Phase Uitkijk Block-North Paradise Oil Company (POC), a Staatsolie subsidiary, has recently continued its operations in the Uitkijk Block. Two evaluation wells were drilled in May in the northern part of the area. The evaluation wells have depths greater than 370 meters. Drilling, observations and surveys are jointly conducted with Tullow Oil, the British-Irish firm which signed a Joint Operations Agreement in 2007. The two wells will be closely monitored for six months. Tests must reveal whether this area has the same type of oil as the Tambaredjo field. Aspects as ground pressure, viscosity and water content of the well will also be evaluated. ?If this field has recoverable resources we will know what developmental strategies we can apply,? says POC Operations Manager Patrick Brunings. The oil traces have remarkably been located in a very thin layer. The Uitkijk Block is situated close to the Tambaredjo field. Further exploration of the Uitkijk Block is based on data collected by the Canadian Company Koch, which explored the area, some ten years ago. Interpretation In 2007, POC and Tullow Oil restarted further exploration of the Uitkijk Block. Between 2007 and 2009 ten wells have been drilled. Data collected during the exploration revealed that the area has oil deposits, roughly estimated between four and six million barrels. This field would have a production span between ten and fifteen years. The next phase must reveal not only whether these estimates are realistic but whether recovering the oil would be profitable. A thorough evaluation of both wells must yield this data. The output per well will be decisive. The evaluation phase will also address the production behavior issue. It regards the water, oil and gas ratio found in certain quantities and how this ratio changes in time. Brunings reiterates that ?whether Uitkijk North will see further development depends on interpretation of the data.? Tests must reveal if producing the oil will be profitable. ?Every well requires an exact survey to get a better insight of the area.? In order to determine how far the field stretches eastward a third well is drilled to the east of the two evaluation wells. An economic model is drafted to test run the several scenarios and to decide which possibilities there are to recover the oil. If the area proves to be indeed commercially profitable, it will take three to four years before production could be launched. Uitkijk Block-South POC has also laid eyes on the southern part of the Uitkijk Block and is already planning exploration drillings for that area. Geological data for that area, however, is scarce. An analysis of the data gathered from the Uitkijk Block North will present a better picture of the area with prospective locations and depths of oil deposits in Uitkijk South. Preparations for drilling exploration wells have already been made, including environment and social studies. The prospected well locations are mainly situated in residential areas and on land owned by third parties. Contact with the local community is therefore very important. Soon several consultation sessions with the community will be kicked off to inform them of the coming operations. Five possible locations have been projected for the three proposed wells. Geological data will be decisive for selecting the locations of the three wells, which lie quite far apart. This drilling program will commence, according to plan, in the final quarter of 2011., 23017=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 High-impact wells to commence drilling in 2H 2011 in Guyana, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Kenya., 45220=In Uganda, the group has guided strongly that the farm-out will complete in September following which $2.9bn will be paid over to Tullow, completely de-gearing the group. On the exploration/appraisal front, three well results were announced. Offshore Ghana, the Akasa (formerly Dahoma up-dip) hit a good package of light oil bearing sands; in the UK sector, the Bunter sands in the Foxtrot structure were found to be water wet only and the huge step out on Jobi-East was also water wet. DAVY VIEW: The results demonstrate the strengthening of the group's production profile, and the doubled dividend is probably meant to signal Tullow's confidence in its ability to continue production and cash flow growth., 44631=Arguably one to keep an eye on for the long term at todays prices if the Ugandan cash comes through as promised - amongst many others of course!. http://www.davy.ie/LR?id=1574 Full year production guidance is now for 82,000-84,000 boepd, with the reduction largely due to the Jubilee ramp-up delay but also some delays on infill drilling across other group assets. Progress continued in moving the Enyenra and Tweneboa discoveries towards development with project sanction expected in 2012., 57929=http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110909-702807.html \"This shows we are sitting at the top table of exploration,\" said Angus McCoss, Tullow's exploration director, in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires. \"This proves the Jubilee play is mirrored on the South American side of the Atlantic,\" said McCoss. \"This result marks the start of a significant and potentially transformational long-term exploration and appraisal campaign in the region.\" The discovery is a \"major step\" because the geological system offshore Latin America is bigger than that of offshore Ghana, said McCoss. \"There are at least half a dozen more of these Zaedyus type traps adjacent,\" and the chance of finding oil in them has increased, he said. Tullow Oil has hit a home run with this discovery, said Bank of America Merrill Lynch in a research note. The bank initially gave Tullow a 10% chance of finding 700 million barrels of oil, but the nature of the discovery means the total resources could grow beyond this, it said. The discovery means Tullow and its partners can now drill with a greater chance of success in licenses they hold offshore Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote d'Ivoire, Suriname and Guyana, said McCoss. These areas all have very similar geology because, \"if you turn the clock back 100 million years, the Atlantic was just a narrow sea,\" said McCoss. Plate tectonics have since dragged the continent apart, but the geological structures that trapped the oil have remained intact. Shell is the largest stake holder, with 45% of the license offshore French Guiana where the discovery was made. Tullow, which is running the drilling operation, has a 27.5% stake. French oil company Total SA (TOT) has 25% and Northpet has 2.5% \"Certainly we've got the financial muscle and strategic mindset to move fast on this,\" said McCoss. Tullow and Spain's Repsol SA (REP) will start drilling the Jaguar prospect offshore Guyana in October, he said., 21425=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jubilee field has produced over 10 million barrels gross; production currently around 80,000 bopd with ramp up to 120,000 bopd expected to be reached in August., 33033=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-25/tullow-geologist-gambles-on-70-billion-oil-find-by-chasing-atlantic-drift.html, 22139=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Working interest production averaged 75,350 boepd in 1H 2011; 2011 full year production guidance now 90,000 to 94,000 boepd., 22869=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zaedyus well in French Guiana commenced drilling in March; result expected in August., 23786=\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Record 1H 2011 revenue of $1.05 billion.

It bears similarities with the discovery well for Jubilee Mahogany 1. The result materially derisks a family of up to five Zaedyus lookalike fans. While each target will need to be drilled, a working petroleum up system has been shown to be present in the immediate area. Specifically, the basin is mature for hydrocarbons with a working source., 17198=http://www.investegate.co.uk/article.aspx?id=201101270700181578A&fe=1 TRADING STATEMENT AND OPERATIONAL UPDATE - Jubilee First Oil achieved within 40 months of discovery 83% E&A success ratio in 2010; high-impact drilling programme for 2011 Continued progress towards Uganda farm-down}",
