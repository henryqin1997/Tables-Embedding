Suppose of 100 plots of nonfederal land in the U.S. excluding Alaska, 27 are forestland (see NRCS 2004 for other percentages). In a sample of 10 plots, what is the probability that only one plot is forested? The answer is 0.151, which is computed as , where N = 100, r = 27, n = 10, and y = 1. Students could be asked to find the probability of other events in this scenario and in a scenario with different values of r, n, and N. Larsen and Marx (1986; page 94) provide some additional examples. The game of Scrabble has 54 consonants and 44 vowels on games tiles. Seven tiles are distributed initially. What is chance of receiving all consonants? After this calculation, students can be asked to compute the chance of 1, 2, or 3 consonants and 5, 6, or 7 vowels. Suppose two blank tiles are included in the original population and are neither consonants nor vowels. How do the probabilities change? The table below gives the probabilities to three decimal places for the number of consonants. Further examples of the type of contrast are included in Larsen (2004b)., 65702=Diezmann, C.

    "textBeforeTable": "4.2. Making Outlines In addition to writing less than could be profitably written in some examples, most student lecturers do not present an outline of topics at the beginning of a lecture. Student instructors are not alone in omitting outlines. Many lecturers also do not make the structure of the class topics explicit as lecture progresses. Both of these practices, an initial and an evolving outline, can increase clarity, help students take notes, and emphasize the purpose of discussing a particular topic. Outlines can be written on a black/whiteboard before class. Topics can be \ufffdchecked off\ufffd as they are covered in class. Here are some sample outlines that could have been used to describe lectures observed at Chicago: Writing more, example 7: Derivations. If x1, x2, ..., xn are n observations on variable X and Y = a + bX is a linear transformation (producing y1, y2, ..., yn), then . It is not uncommon for instructors to skip steps when deriving these results. Of course, students can (and should) realize these relationships through application to data and simulation, but it would be appropriate to present a derivation to a more mathematical crowd. For students encountering derivations and manipulating abstract symbols for perhaps the first time, omitting details can be confusing and elicit questions such as \ufffdHow did you go from the second to the third line?\ufffd Graduate student instructors often are",
    "textAfterTable": "The outlines are short, highlight main points, and do not present details. In the first example, one could combine lines 2-4 into either two lines or one line. All four connect to the purpose of the lecture. It would not take much time to write such an outline and also the relevant section number of the textbook on the board at the start of class. An evolving outline provides verbal and visual punctuation that keep students focused on the current topic. It helps students relate what is happening in class to the larger outline, or bigger picture. Winston (1999) emphasizes the value of making the structure of a talk explicit. Students tend to write in their notes what is written on the board. As in any audience, students in a class do not pay attention the whole time. At the end of class, students should be able to accurately state the main focus of the lecture and remember some impression of what happened. Of course students have to study outside of class to better learn details, but an evolving outline coordinated with an initial outline can help lecture become a better learning experience. Say the lecture topic is the Binomial probability distribution. A lecture title could be \ufffdThe Binomial Distribution.\ufffd An initial outline might list three topics: A. probabilities; B. mean and standard deviation; and C. normal approximations.
