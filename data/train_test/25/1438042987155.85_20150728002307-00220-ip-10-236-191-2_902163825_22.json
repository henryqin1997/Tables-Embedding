            "There is campus security but they do not patrol around the entire campus as they should.",
            "NONE. Eastern isn't about greek life, they are about Jesus and helping others.",
            "There are clubs and activities but I personally find them boring and not worth going to.",
            "Great for Christians who want to fellowship with fellow believers and for those that love nature because the scenery at Eastern is beautiful.",
            "There is a big rock that any student is allowed to paint on. One time on November 5, a group of students watched the movie V for Vendetta and in the movie the guy says remember remember the 5th of November and students went out and painted the rock white to cover up the previous art-work and painted a big V from the movie on there.",
            "I believe that Eastern can improve. Charging girl students fines for being in boy dorms and boys for being in girls dorms before a certain time is ridiculous. They should charge students for being there after 4pm because people aren't going to be doing stuff early in the day. The policy on that should be you get a fine if you in violation after 4 pm NOT before. It makes no sense. Academic wise you do get bang for your buck but they should change the food and the outlay of some of the dorms in Hainer Hall.",
            "There isn't much to do for fun honestly. I mean there is a gym but it is very tiny. There are basketball courts, pool tables, ping pong tables, tvs; but you have to go to the RA's to get the remote or the pool balls and sticks because people are irresponsible.",
            "The cafteria is hit or miss. Sometimes the food is good but sometimes it down right sucks! Rumor has it that there are laxatives in the food because everybody is constantly going to the bathroom more than usual. They do have a big variety; salad bar, make your own sandwhich bar, grill, cereals, desserts, pizza bar, etc. There is a lot to choose from but on the days when the food is bad your only choice is a make your own sandwhich or go eat out.",
            "The dorms, depending on where you stay are nice. Sparrowk is awesome but Hainer is terrible and smells like cat pee sometimes. Gulph is the most highly sought after as it is new but Eagle is nice as well as that is the newest. It all depends on where you dorm and if you do, do NOT choose Hainer if you have a choice!",
            "Not only are the classes interesting but they are tough academically. Being listed as #98 on US Weekly's top colleges on the East Coast, you need to be prepared mentally for the workload. This isn't just a breeze-by kind of University.",
            "If you are considering Eastern University my advice is to pray about it. The reason being is because it is a Christian University and each student loves Jesus or is looking for that relationship with God. If you are not interested in that kind of stuff then this isn't the school for you.",
            "This is an amazing school academically and socially. Each semester the students are excited for the incoming freshman to show them around the school and to help them ease into their college experience. It is a great atmosphere and will be both a learning experience inside and outside the classroom."

Not only does everyone feel safe, but the security guards go out of their way to help students get from place to place, unlock buildings, and maintain order. Greek Life While there aren't any Greek fraternities or sororities, there are many clubs and organizations that have Greek Life-like characteristics. For example, many sports teams have their own buildings that they live in, and there are a lot of community service oriented clubs. There are also gender specific groups in which you can bond with a close group of girls or guys called Grow Groups. They are bound to be",
