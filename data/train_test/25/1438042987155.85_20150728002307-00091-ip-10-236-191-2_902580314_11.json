I cannot wait for August 18th., 184949=Mountain Day is when you are woken up at 4am by airhorns in September or October on an unknown day, to tell you there is no class. The entire school then goes up to Raystown Lake where there are a variety of activities that happen. Lobsterfest, Storming the Arch, Mr. Juniata, and Madrigal are also a traditions that make Juniata unique., 149331=The food at Juniata is a little disappointed but it is better than cooking canned food every night. They tend to put all the good food in one meal during one day of the week but there are different dining options available so you probably will not get tired of a certain food. And after all, they are renovation the cafeteria and changing the way the food is going to be served for the 2013 school year!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Academic Rigor Because Juniata is a Liberal Arts school, students are exposed to many different subject areas than just their intended major. Classes are usually small and professors are always willing to help. You do have to apply yourself though, slacking won't get you very far.
