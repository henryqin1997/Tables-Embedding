    "textAfterTable": "11 Songs Editors\u2019 Notes The Men break all kinds of rules. Their music\u2019s bark is as bad as its bite; it rages and pummels, burying perfectly capable hooks and melody under an avalanche of guitars. Yet they do it so smartly, so efficiently, that not a riff is wasted, not a layer of grime yearns to be wiped away. And they dare make instrumentals a large part of their weaponry (one even mixes twangy slide guitar with a Spacemen 3 haze). They serve up songs that easily crash the three-minute barrier, with two beauties clocking in at more than seven minutes each. The Men unabashedly beg, borrow, and steal: their last LP title (Leave Home) was lifted from The Ramones, and riffs and tones on songs like \u201cOpen Your Heart,\u201d \u201cAnimal,\u201d and \u201cOscillation\u201d are inspired by antecedents The Buzzcocks, The Damned, and Sonic Youth. The clamorous assault of guitarists Mark Perro and Nick Chiericozzi\u00a0recalls the sheer power of bands like H\u00fcsker D\u00fc and The Stooges. So why aren\u2019t we complaining? Because each release by The Men leaves us a little more in awe, and they prove, again, that punk rock seeds sown 35 years ago can still sprout fresh, green shoots that impress and thrill.
