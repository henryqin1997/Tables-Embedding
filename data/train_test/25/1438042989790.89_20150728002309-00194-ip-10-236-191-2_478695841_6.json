The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope. [0066] In one embodiment, the secondary record 340 is an exact copy of the primary record 340 with the exception of the logical volume to which it points. For example, the primary record 340 preferably points to a primary logical volume 320 stored on a primary physical volume 116. Similarly, the secondary record 340 preferably points to a secondary logical volume 320 stored on a secondary physical volume 116. The primary and secondary logical volumes 320 are preferably exact copies of one another. The primary and secondary physical volumes 116, on the other hand, are preferably distinct media cartridges 116 so that the physical loss of one cartridge 116 does not render inaccessible the logical volume 320 located on the second cartridge 116. [0065] The method 600 begins 602 by copying 604 the primary record 340 from a root record directory to a buffer. The buffer is preferably located on the DASD cache 210.",
