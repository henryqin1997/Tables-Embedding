Mills is tucked away from highway 580 in Oakland, yet the free shuttle we operate allows anyone to get anywhere around the East Bay. BART is a great way to travel to San Francisco as well.",
            "We are a very education-based campus, but do maintain social lives! Mills women are the strongest and smartest women in the world! Faculty and staff wish only the best for their students: one on one tutoring is available (free!) and classes have a small ratio making learning more efficient.",
            "Mills has an extensive science program, as well as a broad liberal arts education. Mills has a female-only undergraduate population, but there are men on the campus! We maintain a very open environment for whoever wants to join the college and feel included in the Mills community."

Campus life at Mills College makes it a perfect place to learn about who you are and what you believe. Something I have discovered while here. Login to rate or flag the reviews Kimberly from Los Angeles, CA 03/20/2010 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon. Reviewer has been to campus. 7 out of 7 people found this review useful. 2 of 35 Categories Comments Great for these types of students This school is great for the type of young women who are timid and shy, and need to blossom into strong and confident women, ready to go out in the world on their own. Since all your classrooms will be filled with women only, you won't have the subconscious belief that the male is superior to you. There is this type of equality in Mills campus. Tips for prospective students I suggest you really look at their website and visit their campus",
