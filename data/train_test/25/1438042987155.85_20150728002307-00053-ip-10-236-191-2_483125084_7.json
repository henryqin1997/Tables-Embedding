No. 07/204,456, filed June 9, 1988, by the same title, now abandoned., 17993=The personal computer system includes a video monitor for viewing the data, a keyboard system for entering and manipulating the data, and most importantly, the main housing which is collectively termed the central processing unit, or CPU for short. In the original IBM PC introduced in early 1981, there was in the CPU a space or port for housing a floppy disk drive. The space or port in the CPU allowed for the installation of at least one and usually two floppy disk drives which were installed side-by-side and accessible from the front of the CPU. The shortcomings of a floppy disk drive include the limited amount of information storable on a floppy diskette which was limited to 360 kilobytes of information. The need was apparent to increase the storage capability of the original IBM PC and hence the IBM PC XT was introduced shortly thereafter. The IBM PC XT included on floppy disk drive having a 360 kilobyte storage capability and also a fixed drive permanently installed in the CPU and which was and still is commonly referred to as a Winchester hard drive. This Winchester hard drive was further defined as a 51/4 inch drive and it could hold around 5 megabytes of information. The 51/4 inch Winchester hard drive became and was the standard of the industry for several years. The thickness of the 51/4 inch Winchester hard drive has been reduced by half. The new version is called a half-height 51/4 inch Winchester drive.}",

Mounting holes 43 are in alignment between the sides 50 and 60 as well as pairs 47 and 49. This alignment is perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of movement of the cartridge 40 relative to the support bracket 100. It is to be understood that there is one mounting hole 43, 47 and 49 mounted in each side 50 and 60.
