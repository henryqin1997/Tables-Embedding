The rapper and singer was born Steven Markowitz in New York City and grew up in a Jewish household in Plainview, Long Island, writing lyrics as a kid and rapping at friends' parties in high school, where he adopted his moniker from the childhood nickname Hoodie. While attending the University of Pennsylvania, he released 2008\u2019s Making Waves mixtape and 2009\u2019s Bagels and Beats EP and Pep Rally mixtape, which sampled Death Cab for Cutie, Flight Facilities, and Two Door Cinema Club, and generated internet buzz for its track \"You Are Not A Robot\", sampling Marina & The Diamonds. Hoodie has also wowed audiences on tour with the likes of Chiddy Bang, Das Racist, and RJD2, as well as headlining a concert trek across the United States. With pop-rap style in the vein of Asher Roth and Sam Adams, his multi-speed and witty lyrics coupled with his vibrant beats are sure to entertain ticket holders. His newest mixtape Crew Cuts featured contributions from Chance the Rapper, Chiddy Bang and Shwayze, and his 2013 fall tour took him through cities in Europe and the U.S., 298025=\u00a9 1999-2015 Ticketmaster.
