            "For those on a budget it is incredibly easy to look for things to do you just have to be willing to search.",
            "The proximity to the city is perfect for those who are willing to seek adventure. The club life isn't that great for those who are under 21 but that's not to say that there aren't any other fun activities.",
            "The food is amazing. There are a lot of hole in the wall restaurants that are perfect for the college budget and many restaurants nearby for those with a little more to spend. Word gets around on the best places to eat and there is always something new to try.",
            "The dorm experience is amazing. If you are in the regular two person dorms theres a ton of commotion so adjustments must be made but you get to meet a ton of people. For the people living in the 2 bedroom apartment style dorms it is less social on the floors but that's why you have to make sure to make tons of friends in the beginning and get over any shyness.",
            "A lot of majors are impacted and the workload is heavy but staying organized is key as well as prioritizing. The teachers are pretty understanding for the most part that their class isn't the only one we're taking and so it all depends on the communication that goes on between the student and professor.",
            "The weather affects the students a lot. If a student is coming from a place like Southern California where there is almost always sun and barely any rain it is a big shock and it is a bit depressing. Come prepared with lots ok layers!!",
            "I love San Francisco State's proximity to the city because there is always something for students to do on the weekends when homework is completed. The culture is very different from my home town in the San Fernando Valley. I recommend San Francisco State to anyone ready to have an adventure."

College is about exploring and having fun and I cannot stress how much better your college experience will be if you just remember to have fun. When you wake up at 7:59 A.M. for your 8 o'clock morning class, instead of dwelling about it, make the best of it. You only get one real college experience so you might as well make the best of it., 299941=Not that everyone is living in the dorm. It's mostly for freshman, sophomore, and transfers. Still, the dorm is so convenient, fun and quite random. You mostly will find tons of drama with your roommate and random things int he hall way, such as people in costume in the middle of March or people dancing, singing or playing guitar on the small quad. Not a good place for quiet and clean freak people., 172316=If you have considered this school i hope you have considered the cost of living in the City, the dorms are expensive and rent at even the cheapest of apartments are upwards of $2100 a month, for one bedrooms and studios. On the other hand, receiving a college education and life experiences a city like San Francisco will put you through are priceless...., 330779=The food at the college leaves alot to be desired. However, there are many types of foods to choose from...from extremely healthy to extremely fattening. The cafeteria is always full and robust. Get there before 11:50 am. That's when the large crowd begins to fall into the cafeteria and if you have a class at 12:20, you may be pushing it. If all else fails, there are a few cafe type establishments at the head of the school and in the HSS building on the first floor. Plenty of vending machines if you're pressed for time or pack a lunch the night before and bring it with you. Lunch on campus is a little expensive., 111218=Sign up for the dorms before January of the year you are planning on attending., 708894=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 431573=Every October a group of people dressed as zombies attack people., 332392=Some classes can be challenging, especially if some classes are cross-listed. It's all relevant. Just be a sponge and don't fall into the trap of procrastination. You're grade can turn out to be a C when you are clearly A material. There are lots of group projects in upper division and just like any place of employment, there will always be one or two that are 'slackers' or give the bare minimum. Do not let that stop YOUR progress and grade. If you see something needs to be done by another person, just do it yourself or get assistance from others within your group. I had a 'group' that started out with four people and ended up a 'me' project. Everyone had excuses on why they couldn't or didn't do their part. I didn't let that stop me. I did everyone's section and I received an A+. Believe in yourself and your abilities. If you are not sure, seek out a tutor. Remember, this is your life at stake because when it's all said and done, many of these students you may never see again, and it will be only you holding the torch. March to victory, NEVER settle for defeat from merely not trying., 19849=Attend office hours, attend office hours, attend office hours. Professors stay overtime to answer your questions, and most of them want your money to go to actually learning something. Take advantage. Don't miss class. It's tempting to sleep through your morning classes, yes, but don't forget that you're paying for those. Know your sleeping schedule before registering. If it isn't realistic for you to get up at 8:10 every Monday for a Math class, then don't register for that class. Register early.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Every type of student! SF State offers a variety of opportunities for success and you live in one of the greatest cities! Many opportunities to network within the school & outside of SFSU. Tips for prospective students Get involved with an organization of your interest! It is the best way to network & advance yourself. Also, utilize the professor's office hours! It may be intimating at first, but once the professors can put a name to a face you will most likely gain a connection with them and learn a lot more. Check for your professor's teaching style & ratings on ratemyprofessor.com. CARP offers FREE tutoring in most subjects! The Cesar Chavez Student Center is awesome & is designed for student's success & their enjoyment. The library is still under reconstruction, but the Annex is one of the best places to get work done. Also, be prepared for the changing weather! It will be sunny one minute then cold and foggy the next. Bang for the buck I personally do not live in the dorms because I save so much money living in an apartment. I have friends at the dorms & I've been to all of the types of dorms at SF State.
