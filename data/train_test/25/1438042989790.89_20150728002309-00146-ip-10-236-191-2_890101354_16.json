Different personalities and interests will not effect the relationships that you develop on campus, nor the things that you learn. Tips for prospective students Do not be afraid to speak to those around you. Jefferson is not similar to other schools in that you do not have all of these traditional students around judging you for the person that you are. Friends can be found in a variety of walks of life if only you open up a little. Also, do not be afraid to talk to your professors about problems that you are having. Most of them have taught at other schools and are at Jefferson for the friendly, community feel. They really are there to help you, not just as the cliche",
