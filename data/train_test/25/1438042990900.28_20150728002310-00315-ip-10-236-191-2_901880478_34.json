            "I know this school comes with a very large price tag, but it is definitely worth the education and degree that you will receive at the end.",
            "There is an enormous variety of different clubs and organizations on campus, so it is really easy to become involved in almost anything that you want to do! Additionally, there is a large number of student athletes that participate in varsity athletics, and there is always some type of event going on during the weekend- including turning one of the lecture halls in to a movie theater!",
            "The food is okay, nothing spectacular, though it has definitely gotten better over the past two years.",
            "The dorms can be fun, particularly freshman year. There is always an ongoing discussion about which freshman dorms are better- Susan B Anthony residence hall, or the freshman dorms on the quad. Either way, bonding with your particular hall is very common, and the different hall themes can be really fun.",
            "Very challenging school, particularly in the science courses, but definitely worth the effort put in to the education!",
            "You will most likely need pretty good test scores and a well-balanced variety of extracurriculars to get in here, and definitely try to sit in on a class with a student before you apply! Additionally, if you are thinking of majoring in one of the various engineering fields here, make sure to note that when you apply, as the curriculum is much more strict for those programs and requires you to take certain classes at certain times during your college career.",
            "Rochester is an academically challenging school with a beautiful campus, and is full of great people! The professors make you work to the best of your ability, and challenge you to go outside of your comfort zone by pushing you to work harder. Additionally, being a student-athlete here is a tough, but extremely rewarding experience."

Vegan and vegetarian options are found everywhere and the school is very accommodating towards documented allergies. The food is edible, but don't expect high quality, 328703=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 49160=Dandelion Day is typically the last Friday in April, when the entire student body congregates on the residence quad for a carnival, celebrating the arrival of good weather, and the end of a looonnnnngggg winter., 184147=It snows from December to April. There is an underground tunnel system linking different academic buildings that you come to appreciate during the winters., 295417=If you have time to spare, then I recommend going to Danforth Dinning with is located in the Freshman building Sue Bee, Susan B. Anthony. If your in a rush, go to Douglass, or the pit, which is the basement of Common Connections. If you ever have time, which you will, I strongly recommend getting a Mel Burger which is in the Meliora Dinning Center above Douglass Dinning Center. It was annoying as a freshman that you were required to get an unlimited dinning plan because it was expensive and had little declining. However, this upcoming year 2013-2014 should offer a new plan for freshman which offers so many meals a semester and more declining. I would recommend getting one of those plans rather than the unlimited since you get to choose what you want., 211329=Engineering--the school is one of the top for engineering--and anyone who wants to do research. It's in the top 40 in research universities. There is a med school, so students who want to be medical professionals are also perfect. The Sign Language program is amazing, taught by deaf teachers. Rochester has a 1:7 deaf to hearing ratio., 103354=Hey! The University was ranked sixth (6th) by the Daily Meal in their 75 Best Colleges for Food in America for 2014., 105285=The University of Rochester is one of the nation's leading higher education. With a faculty to student ratio of 9:1, students are assured that they will receive the attention necessary for them to succeed throughout their years here at the U of R. Class size are typically 10-25 students, but in the sciences and math, it tend to be pretty large. But wait, don't be scared, workshops or professor/teacher assistant office hours are offered for to students sitting in these classes. In writing classes, there are also writing fellows and consultants at your service. If interested, I would advice a prospective student to do intensive research about the university. Meliora.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students UR accepts well-rounded individuals who have the grades, the activities, and the community service. More specifically, UR has an amazing medical program, since it is associated with Strong Memorial Hospital. It also contains the Eastman school of Music, which is one of the best music schools in the nation. However, the Rochester curriculum can really be tailored to fit any type of student. The only necessary quality I would say is dedication. Tips for prospective students The University of Rochester loves to see an International Baccaulaureate degree or Advanced Placement credits. And of course, as with any other college, make sure to have plenty of extra-curricular activities and community service. Bang for the buck Though it is very expensive, the University of Rochester is very prestigious, a degree from UR means more than from other colleges. In addition, the Career Center will work with you throughout and after your college career to help you find the best job and start earning back some green. Am enjoying being here The students and the faculty are great. There is always someone to help you at the University of Rochester with academics. Plus there are literally hundreds of clubs",
