            "OU has its own police and occasionally you will see them on bicycles riding throughout the campus. They are friendly and they will even walk with you back to your dorm at night. No matter where you go at night, many people's reactions are that they are fearful, suspicious, and wary. While I even have those emotions at times, coming late from the library at night, I can always count on the OU Police Department to be there for me.",
            "There are many clubs and organizations that hold meetings or events on certain nights to choose from. There are also many restaurants open at night. Or, you could take a drive to Moore at attend the Warren Theatre for a movie with friends.",
            "The food and dining is pretty great. Other students take your order and the food is hot and ready made just as your ordered it. There are food places in walking distance and there are a variety of types of food. For example, there are vegetarian options, healthy-lifestyle options, and many others. There are always enough seating for students to sit with others or even occupy a whole booth to yourself.",
            "The dorm life is actually pretty great. Depending on how the layout of the room is, there can be quite a bit of spacious room to live in. The study room and lounge room on the floor is nice because instead of sitting in your room where you do everything else in (get dressed, shower, sleep) you are able to sit in there. Also, I encourage you to interact with your floor; it is fun to greet others and see what they are up to, rather than awkwardly walk past them. The only downside of the dorm life at OU is that there is no where to cook for yourself; but, with the many other places to eat, it is not much of an issue.",
            "Academics here are more difficult than they were in high school. This is the next step in your education, so take classes seriously and try not to skip class as much as possible. Utilize professors' office hours and manage your time wisely. Also, utilize the library's resources and form study groups. In the beginning of the semester, the professor's give you only about three days to get used to college life, then they get right down to teaching you lessons.",
            "Take a campus tour first whether it is a registered campus tour through the website or an ordinary day for college students. Not only look around the buildings and familiarize yourself, but interact with a few students to really gain insight in their opinions about the school. There are a lot of restaurants and shops in Norman, so I suggest looking around the college town as well. Also, definitely check out the dorm rooms.",
            "The University of Oklahoma is a great choice to continue your education. The college is prestige. There is palpable school spirit."

For me anyway, housing and food services did not have you fill out a questionnaire to help assign a roommate to that could be problematic. There was a record number of changes during the 2014 school year., 1017252=Definetly apply early so that you can be enered into the freshman class scholarships which the deadline is February I believe. Also visit the campus because it is perfect for me, but others may find the campus to be out of their style or wants., 352334=The University of Oklahoma has an 18:1 student to teacher ratio. It is very known for the vigorous courses students take each year. With the toughness of the courses the ratio gives each student opportunities to learn more then they would in a big class., 1057840=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 22035=I greatly enjoyed being at this university! I plan on going back in the fall matter of fact! The campus is wonderful and beautiful. I felt like I was at home a week in. The people there are so happy and friendly and all the upperclassmen really do help you out and make you feel welcome. During welcome week there are a load of activities and they even have golf carts to take you to class if you get lost! Which is an awesome idea since the Oklahoma heat in September can be..overwhelming., 810708=Dorm Life is ok. Other than the opposite sex curfew they have it is just ok. P.S. Couch is the place to be. Westside 8th floor 2011., 211603=there's no place better to be than ou for college football. there's a wide variety of intramural sports, from rugby to quidditch, the later of which ou actually hosted the world cup for in 2010. if sports aren't your thing, the union programming board offers a free movie night every friday with screenings of recent movies., 99897=I haven't actually moved in & started attending classes yet (I move in August 15th) but I've been there twice. Once for Sooner Saturday, an event for prospective student & I went to enroll. I love the campus it's so beautiful. The people here are very kind & helpful.}",

You have to study smart to make the grade. **Make a plan that will help you keep from procrastinating. **Try to move into your dorm at least two weeks or a week-and-half before school. Don't wait the day before class to move in or you wont know where to go. **A college tour is helpful **When you know what your classes are, go at least two or three days before class begins and walk around campus to find your classes, how long it will take you to get to them, and to learn the lay of the land. Trust me this helped me tremendously. Do this at least twice. . **Try to find the quickest way to get to your classes. **Make sure you know where the library is and the open/close time. I think it closes at 2 a.m. some days. **Make sure you know where the Bursar Office is. **You should acquire a bank account. **Make sure you learn how to take the bus around campus. You have to get a sticker on the back of your ID card to be able to ride for free. Make sure to get a bus schedule and find out where the bus office is. Some buses like the Lloyd Noble Shuttle are free for everyone **Make sure you know where the housing office is(Walker Tower, 1st Floor) and where the bathrooms and",
