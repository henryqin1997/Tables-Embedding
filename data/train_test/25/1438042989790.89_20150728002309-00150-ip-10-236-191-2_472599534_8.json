    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While there has been described above and illustrated in the drawings various forms and modifications in accordance with the invention, it will be appreciated that the invention is not limited thereto but encompasses all variations and alternatives in accordance with the appended claims. The tracking wheel arrangement thus provides measurements and control signals as the applicator 200 is moved between positions. Once pulses have been emitted from the two emitter apertures at a given selected location, the applicator 200 is simply rolled along the skin surface a distance measured by the tracking wheel combination. Without raising the applicator 200 off the skin surface, the operator is informed by an indicator light, a distinct sound, or even a tactile impression, such as a vibration, that the precisely determined next location has been reached. In this manner, while also firing microwave pulses alternately from the two adjacent emitters, the operating doctor or technician can proceed immediately between successive positions, and total application time can be significantly reduced. In this example, however, the two waveguides 210, 212, are operated alternately. For this purpose, an input coax line 230 feeds into a central input of a single pole double throw RF switch 234, which has two coax outputs 236, 237 feeding to SMA connectors 240, 241 each coupling into a different double ridged waveguide 210 or 212 and providing a coax to rectangular waveguide transition. Signals from the control circuits",
