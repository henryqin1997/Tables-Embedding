Nos. 5,959,367 and 6,000,823, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. The in-vehicle components such as in system 10 of FIG. 1 can be linked by wired connection or by wireless connection such as IR wireless communication or RF communication [such as using the BLUETOOTH protocol such as is available from Motorola of Schaumberg, Ill.], and as disclosed in provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/187,960 filed Mar. 9, 2000, by McCarthy et al. for a COMPLETE MIRROR-BASED GLOBAL-POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) NAVIGATION SOLUTION, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Preferably, linkage of the in-vehicle components of system 10 is at least partially, and preferably substantially, via linkage to a vehicle bus system or network such as a CAN or LIN system such as disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 60/196,577, filed Mar. 31, 2000, by Lynam et al. for a DIGITAL ELECTROCHROMIC CIRCUIT WITH A VEHICLE NETWORK SUCH AS A CAR AREA NETWORK OR A LOCAL INTERCONNECT NETWORK (Attorney Docket No. DON01 P-814), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference., 84922=In a further aspect of this present invention, the display of information in a road transportation vehicle, such as map and/or directional data presented to the driver and/or other vehicle cabin occupants, by a display device within the vehicle cabin (preferably a display device such as a video screen located at, on or within the interior rearview mirror assembly such as described in provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/186,520, filed Mar. 1, 2000, by Lynam et al. entitled an INTERIOR REARVIEW MIRROR ASSEMBLY INCORPORATING A VIDEO SCREEN (Attorney Docket No. DON01 P-802)) includes a dynamic zoom function. Conventionally, many commercially available navigation systems show a standard view (such as a local area with streets, cross-streets and the like) with, often, additional control means (such as manual input controls or voice-activated controls) to zoom in or zoom out of a particular level of detail. Often the level of detail provided, and the options thereto, are inadequate or inappropriate for navigation, and can serve as a distraction to the driver. The dynamic map resolution of the present invention provides an automatic, hands-free dynamic zoom capability to the GPS display (or any other display) in the vehicle cabin. In accordance with the present invention, the distraction of the driver is alleviated by providing a dynamic resolution function whereby the resolution of mapping information (or any other type of information being displayed to an occupant of the vehicle such as the driver) is automatically adjusted in accordance with a vehicle parameter and/or a personal parameter applicable at a particular moment/driving condition/driving location so that the information provided is dynamically adjusted to meet the needs of a particular driving task. The data presentation being dynamic, the type of information, such as the level of map information, is varied throughout the total drive., 75426=In another vehicle-based navigation system 20 (FIGS. 2a and 2 b), a vehicle 22 includes a navigation system 24, such as a GPS. A portable device 26 is removably coupled with vehicle 22 through a communication port 28. Coupling of portable device 26 with vehicle 22 is preferably by radio-frequency link, infra-red link, radio link or satellite link, or any combination thereof. Portable device 26 additionally includes a position locator 30 which establishes the position of portable device 26. For example portable device 26 may comprise a cellular hand-held mobile phone that is equipped with a position locator circuit/feature that identifies the geographical location from which a phone call or communication link is being made using that cellular phone. When portable device 26 is removed from port 28, such as when the occupant leaves vehicle 22, an optional communication link 32 provides data exchanged between portable unit 26 in vehicle 22 in a manner which will be described below. Examples of docking techniques and dockable accessories and of portable devices are disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/449,121 filed Nov. 24, 1999, by Hutzel et al. for a REARVIEW MIRROR ASSEMBLY WITH UTILITY FUNCTIONS, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,428,172, patent application Ser. No. 60/199,676, filed Apr. 21, 2000, by McCarthy et al. for a VEHICLE MIRROR ASSEMBLY COMMUNICATING WIRELESSLY WITH VEHICLE ACCESSORIES AND OCCUPANTS (Attorney Docket No. DON01 P-818), and patent application Ser. No. 09/466,010 filed Dec. 17, 1999, by DeLine et al. for an INTERIOR REARVIEW MIRROR SOUND PROCESSING SYSTEM, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,420,975, the disclosures of which are all hereby incorporated herein by reference., 94276=For night vision purposes (such as with forward-facing cameras or when viewing a child at night in a darkened vehicle cabin or trapped in a darkened vehicle trunk compartment), use of near-infrared light-emitting sources, and in particular near-IR emitting LEDs and lasers, is desirable in order to provide illumination for a night-viewing camera while avoiding glaring with visible light, as disclosed in commonly assigned patent application Ser. No. 08/952,026 filed Nov. 19, 1997, by Schofield et al. for a REARVIEW VISION SYSTEM FOR VEHICLE INCLUDING PANORAMIC VIEW, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Where multiple laser sources are used, the light output of lasers emitting light of different non-white colors (for example, three blue emitting lasers and three amber lasers) can be combined to illuminate with metameric white light such as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,803,579 to Turnbull et al. and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,136,483 to Schoniger et al., the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein. Such laser automotive lighting, and preferably white-light laser lighting, can be used in a variety of automotive lighting applications besides mirror-mounted lighting, such as laser-lighted automotive vanity mirrors, dome lights, parking lights, CHMSL lights, reversing lights, running board lights, side marker lights, turn signal lights, brake lights, fog lights, taillights, rail lamps, headlights, spotlights, ashtray lights, trunk compartment lights, storage compartment lights, console lights, and the like. Also, optionally and preferably, a light pipe and/or optical elements such as lenses, diffusers and reflectors can be used in conjunction with a laser light source, preferably a white-light producing laser source, in order to distribute/project light within or out from the vehicle, and/or to expand or direct/project the laser-generated light beam. Most preferably, at least one diffractive optical element is used in conjunction with an automotive laser light source., 49553=This application claims priority from provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/131,593 filed on Apr. 29, 1999., 77316=In operation, while portable unit 26 is engaged with port 28, such as during operation of the vehicle, the position of vehicle 22 may be stored (such as in an electronic digital memory) within portable unit 26 when portable unit 26 is disconnected from port 28. Thereafter, the location of vehicle 22 is retained in portable unit 26 as a \u201chome-base.\u201d This allows the user to always be able to locate his/her vehicle when away from the vehicle. Thus, the present invention includes providing a vehicle location identifier function that allows the driver find the location of the vehicle when it is parked, and when the driver is returning to the parked vehicle. This function is especially useful in congested areas, such as urban areas, parking lots, and the like. If portable unit 26 is coupled with vehicle 22 through a communication link 32 (such as a wireless communication such as telematic links such as are described in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 60/186,520, filed Mar. 1, 2000, by Lynam et al. entitled INTERIOR REARVIEW MIRROR ASSEMBLY INCORPORATING A VIDEO SCREEN (Attorney Docket No. DON01 P-802), application Ser. No. 09/466,010 filed Dec. 17, 1999, by DeLine et al. for an INTERIOR REARVIEW MIRROR SOUND PROCESSING SYSTEM, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,420,975, and application Ser.

No. 6,428,172, Ser. No. 09/433,467 filed Nov. 4, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,613, and Ser. No. 09/448,700 filed Nov. 24, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,329,925, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference., 82232=It is common for vehicle navigation system 24 to be a GPS 24. Such vehicle-based GPS navigation system is disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,971,552 entitled VEHICLE GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM, issued to Desmond J. O'Farrell, Roger L. Veldman and Kenneth Schofield, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference, and commonly assigned provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/187,960 filed Mar. 9, 2000, by McCarthy et al. for a COMPLETE MIRROR-BASED GLOBAL-POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) NAVIGATION SOLUTION and provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/192,721, filed Mar. 27, 2000, by Lynam et al. for an INTERACTIVE AUTOMOTIVE REAR VISION SYSTEM (Attorney Docket No. DON01 P-815), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. It is also common for portable units, such as unit 26, to utilize signal triangulation position location system technology which is especially used in cellular telephones. In certain situations, such as in urban areas among buildings, parking structures, and the like, GPS navigation systems may lose a continuous signal. Under other circumstances, navigation system 30 in portable unit 26 may lose signal. Accordingly, and referring to FIG. 3, a multiple position locator vehicular navigation system 40 having preferential use includes a first position locator 42 and a second position locator 44. First position locator 42 may be a vehicle-based navigation system, such as a GPS-based system 24. Second position locator 44 may be a different type of navigation system, such as navigation system 30 with portable device 26. A control 46 compares the outputs of position locators 42, 44 and determines which position locator is producing the best output. The best output may be a continuous output, a higher accuracy output, or some other quantitative parameter. Control 46 combines the outputs giving preference to the position locator 42, 44 providing the highest quality output. In this manner, with portable unit 26 connected with port 28, vehicle navigation system 20 is less likely to lose navigational signals because the conditions under which navigation system 24 may lose a continuous signal should be different than the conditions under which navigation system 30 loses signal. While navigation system 40 may best be utilized with different types of position-locating devices, it may also be utilized when both position-locating devices utilize the same sensing technology, such as a GPS or the like., 90849=Optionally, rearview mirror assembly 19 includes at least one map/reading/courtesy light, most preferably comprising a non-incandescent lamp such as a light-emitting diode (LED) array (most preferably, each such array comprising at least one, and more preferably a plurality of at least two, white light-emitting diodes such as are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser.
