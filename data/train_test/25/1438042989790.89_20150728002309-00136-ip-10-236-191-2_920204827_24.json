            "Bring something to the table. It's not just about the academics or community service. Over half the student population at Princeton is involved in a sport. There are also many cultural activities available to join. The University is looking for individuals who have more to offer than just their 4.0's and perfect SAT's. Of course, that doesn't hurt either.",
            "I wasn't sure I would be accepted at Princeton, but I knew if I was accepted there was no question in my mind this was where I wanted to be. The campus is beautiful, the professor are unbelievably helpful and the diversity of the student population is very stimulating. That being said, it's not for everyone."

It is a very demanding environment, but if you stay organized it doesn't have to be overly stressful. Other than that, the beauty of Princeton is that it's great for all types of students. The diversity of interests and backgrounds make Princeton the dynamic place that it is. If you are the kind of student that is very concerned about GPA, you should be warned about the grade deflation policy. Whatever level of academic achievement you're used to, which for most Princeton students is a minimum of 4.0, for many there will be a bit of a shock when",
