            "Upon applying to schools I looked specifically for private institutions with small capped classes. FDU caps most of their classes at about 25-30 although a lot are significantly smaller. I think the smaller classes allows for a student-professor relationship to the point where the teacher knows the students name. Along with smaller classes usually the professors don't teach as many classes enabling them to be more hands on and accessible. So if you want smaller classes, closer relationships with your professors and easy accessibility, FDU is the place to be.",
            "There are two FDU campuses so make sure you do your research and make sure your major and possible minor is at the right campus. You can't just pick up and transfer back and fourth. And get involved, people complain that things can get boring but if you're involved you have something to do at all times. Whether you're involved by working on campus or in clubs, sports, Greek life or even just working out in the gym try to be on campus. Be involved especially if you commute the more extra curricular activities you involve yourself in the better you'll enjoy college and it's awesome on your resume.",
            "Being that I live at home I do pay significantly lower than students that live on campus but with that and FDU's generous scholarship giving I am saving loads of money which will be amazing upon graduation. If you really search FDU's website you can find a plethora of scholarships that aren't automatically processed that canbe applied for also.",
            "I transferred into FDU during my sophomore year which brought me back to living at home. Although I would have loved to live away at school, FDU's new student orientation allowed for me to feel more at ease being at a new school. All the professor's are friendly and approachable. There are hundreds of clubs and there is an abundance of student involvement regardless of if it's within sports, greek life or just working on campus.",
            "I'm a Criminal Justice: Pre-Law student. The Criminal Justice school is amazing. The director is a retired Policeman and every one on the staff has worked within law in some aspect. They give you more than just a by the book education but rather a first hand experience account of the actual situations that occur and the knowledge you need to know outside of definitions given by paper bound text books."

In most schools there is the terrible receptionist who just doesn't know how to treat people. Have you ever come across one? Well I must say, if you haven't wait until you come to this school. I don't want to generalize, but I must say adulthood is one of the biggest experiences I have had in FDU. The first day January 18Th Orientation was canceled because of the bad weather. I was not notified until later. Later meaning until I was in the school. My Financial Aid Package was not the best looking one, talking about bad days. I don't want to forget the outstanding balance I must cover that Financial Aid won't cover. It's a lot! Finally Am I enjoying being here? NO, Why not just leave? Because I'm a fool., 211251=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

The school is great and there will be no regret attending Fairleigh Dickinson University! Bang for the buck The price students are paying is definitely worth the education. We have the best professors who care about their students. The students feel comfortable to have a close relationship with professors. The education is extraordinary! Am enjoying being here I absolutely love being here. The atmosphere is different. Everyone is so welcoming and comforting. The professors are great for mentoring. Everyone here is extremely friendly. It feels like home! Am learning",
