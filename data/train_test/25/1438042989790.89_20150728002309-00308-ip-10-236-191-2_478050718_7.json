In one embodiment, the dilator 200 and its component parts are machined from stainless steel tubing. Here, each dilator 200 has a handle 210 that is affixed to the dilator proximal end 206. The handle 210 is about 100 mm (4.00\u2033) long and is engaged (e.g., by welding; press fit, etc) in the middle to assure a secure fit with the rod. With reference to FIGS. 13A-C, in one embodiment, there is provided a large dilator construct 199, configured as a dilator sheath 220 and a dilator rod assembly 200 L that comprises a dilator shaft 202 L a dilator handle 210 L and two pins 218 as engagement means for the construct 199 The cannulated dilator shaft 202 L extends between a distal end 204 L and a proximal end 206 L and defines an inner lumen 212 L. The shaft 202 L comprises a tapered tip 208 L with a distal end opening 214 L at the distal end 204 L. The dilator rod assembly 200 L comprises pins 218 extending out from the outer wall of the dilator shaft 202 L.}",

No. 09/782,534, filed on Feb. 13, 2001, teaches various types of techniques for using cutting tools for removing disc material and preparation of spinal treatment sites that comprise a spinal disc, for example, a method of removing at least a portion of the nucleus through a TASII axial bore while leaving the annulus AF intact., 228049=In accordance with one aspect of the embodiments described herein, there is provided a temporary distraction device for separating adjacent vertebral bodies. In one mode of use, the temporary distraction tool is used for preparation of a disc space for receipt of augmentation materials (e.g., osteogenic materials, or annulus repair or sealant materials). In another mode of use, the temporary distraction tool is used to prepare a disc space for subsequent soft fusion (e.g., osteogenic, osteoconductive, or osteoinductive procedure without a fusion rod). In another mode of use, the temporary distraction tool is used to accommodate subsequent implantation of fusion or motion preservation devices. Background information on distraction devices in general appears in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention has been described in terms of certain preferred structures and embodiments, variations on the foregoing will become apparent to those of skill in art in view of the disclosure herein, and are considered to be within the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the present invention is not intended to be limited by any of the forgoing disclosure, and is instead intended to extend to the full scope of the following claims. In an alternate fusion kit, intended for two-level fusion, the kit may include one, two-pieces fusion rods, or one, one-piece fusion rod and one mobility implant, or a two-piece implant, one of which is a fusion implant and one of which is a mobility device The fusion kit additionally includes a rod driver, a paste inserter, one proximal and one distal plugs and two plug drivers. The fusion kit may additionally include one or more twist drills, such as a 7.5 mm and a 6 mm twist drill. The fusion kit will additionally include an exchange system. A fusion kit intended for a one level fusion may include, in addition to the tools in the access and disc preparation with bone graft inserter kits a one piece fusion rod, a rod driver, and a paste inserter. The fusion kit may additionally include a plug, a plug driver, and one or more twist drills such as a 7.5",
