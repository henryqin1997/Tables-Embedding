Likewise, each weight range may not be available in all colors. Therefore we ask you to list and prioritize your color preferences and to give us guidance if the color or weight range you want happens to not be available. Feel free to contact us if you need more specific info. FLX is the best all-weather plastic - designed as a cold weather alternative to firmer plastics, but golfers love it year around. It is a more flexible version of the ESP, soft and flexible but retains its form and stability. The Discraft FLX Buzzz is a straight flying midrange driver with a stability of 0.5 (stable to slightly overstable). In comparison, t he Pro D has a stability of 0.0 (stable). It has quickly become one of the most popular discs of all time. This workhorse is the golf disc that you'll reach for again and again. Throw it hard and the Buzzz will hold any line you put it on.
