Library of Arduino-compatible functions for StarterWare Goal: Run Android applications under Angstrom and toggle back-and-forth using CTRL-ALT-Fn key presses. Existing projects: http://arowboat.org, http://www.angstrom-distribution.org Hardware skills: Minimal Software skills: Able to write software in C and Java, experience with X11 and Android Possible mentors: Hunyue Yau This has essentially been done once as part of Always Innovating's Super-Jumbo demo running Ubuntu, Angstrom, ChromeOS and Android simultaneously. The fundamental challenge is getting it reproducible and integrated into the OpenEmbedded build system for Angstrom and then starting to minimize the wasted file space by sharing libraries. Eventually, even making Android applications run in a window is desired. Some people want to play Angry Birds or run other Android apps on their BeagleBoard/BeagleBone. Of course, you could use the Rowboat Android project as-is, but then you'd have to give up all of their typical Linux/X11 applications available",
