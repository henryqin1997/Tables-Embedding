    "textBeforeTable": "\"MS Mincho\";mso-ansi-language:EN-GB\">Table 1: Variables And Measures According to (Chiasson, 2001) the quality of the KM system does not have a significant direct influence on users\u2019 perceived benefits. However, it is clear that a K-BDSS with system quality is necessary, but not sufficient, to provide benefits that ensure a K-BDSS is running normally. K-BDSS Benefits It has been widely accepted that user satisfaction with K-BDSS strategy has been more effective indicator of organizational performance (Lo & Chin, 2009).How ever evaluation of a K-BDSS can be done through project evaluations or through internal and external review, executing user satisfaction surveys and as well through benchmarking. In another development, it is suggested (Igbaria, 1998; Beijerse, 2000) that system quality, information quality, causes system use, and user satisfaction are also good evaluators of user satisfaction with K-BSS. Another line of it has been augmented by Conley & Wei (2009) that quality influences approach and performance in a KB system approach is also effective. 18.0pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB\"> EN-GB\">User SatisfactionAccording to (Chan et al, 2002) project management perceives lack of user participation in the K-BDSS project as a failure factor which can result in misunderstanding the users\u2019 actual knowledge requirements. Many staff thinks that project management failure is an important factor in the failure of KM projects. \"MS",

In particular, the process through which knowledge is created, stored, shared and used within SMEs in Sudan , which can be summarized by the following two important questions: Why is effective application of the knowledge-based decision support system proceeding slowly in SMEs in Sudan despite the growth in this sector? How can we create an enabling environment which will advance innovation and favour the acquisition and dissemination of knowledge as well as learning? 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Research Model And Hypotheses The following research model (Figure 1) was developed based on the factors identified in the literature in order to assist this study in answering the above questions.",
