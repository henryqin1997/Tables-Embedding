    "textAfterTable": "About May 2014 National, State, Metropolitan, and Nonmetropolitan Area Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates (1) Estimates for detailed occupations do not sum to the totals because the totals include occupations not shown separately. Estimates do not include self-employed workers. (2) Annual wages have been calculated by multiplying the hourly mean wage by a \"year-round, full-time\" hours figure of 2,080 hours; for those occupations where there is not an hourly mean wage published, the annual wage has been directly calculated from the reported survey data. (3) The relative standard error (RSE) is a measure of the reliability of a survey statistic. The smaller the relative standard error, the more precise the estimate. (4) Wages for some occupations that do not generally work year-round, full time, are reported either as hourly wages or annual salaries depending on how they are typically paid. (8) Estimates not released. (9) The location quotient is the ratio of the area concentration of occupational employment to the national average concentration. A location quotient greater than one indicates the occupation has a higher share of employment than average, and a location quotient less than one indicates the occupation is less prevalent in the area than average. top State estimates for Puerto Rico Puerto Rico's metropolitan and nonmetropolitan area estimates: Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebastian, PR Fajardo, PR Guayama, PR",
