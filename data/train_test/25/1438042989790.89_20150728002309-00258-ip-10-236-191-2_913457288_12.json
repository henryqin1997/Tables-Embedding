I've heard the nursing program is really great as well. Tips for prospective students Don't be shy about going to the school and talking with students and teachers, especially in the art department. East Central is really friendly and all of us in the art department love to welcome new people into the studios and talk to them about fine arts and answer any questions. Bang for the buck Because East Central is a small community college the prices are so affordable! My tuition, including books, is about $2,000 a semester. It's great for getting general education classes out of the way so I don't have to pay a ton of money to take them",
