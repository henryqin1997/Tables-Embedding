Adapters accept native messages in XML or non-XML format and publish them to Oracle BPEL PM or Mediator as XML messages. Adapters can also accept XML messages and convert them back to native EIS format. This translation from native data format to XML and back is performed using a definition file (non-XML schema definition), which itself is defined in XML schema format.
