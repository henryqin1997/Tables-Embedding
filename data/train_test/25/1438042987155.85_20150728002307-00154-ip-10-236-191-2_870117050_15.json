According to the 2000 census, the relative number of people of Chinese descent in Indonesia is almost 1%, although this may likely be an underestimate. Words of Chinese origin (presented here with accompanying Hokkien/ Mandarin pronunciation derivatives as well as traditional and simplified characters) include pisau (\u5315\u9996 b\u01d0sh\u01d2u \u2013 knife), mie (\u9eb5 > \u9762 Hokkien m\u012b \u2013 noodles), lumpia (\u6f64\u9905 (Hokkien = l\u016bn-pi\u00e1\u207f) \u2013 springroll), teko (\u8336\u58fa > \u8336\u58f6 = ch\u00e1h\u00fa [Mandarin], teh-ko [Hokkien] = teapot), \u82e6\u529b kuli = \u82e6\u3000khu (bitter) and \u529b\u3000li (energy) and even the widely used slang terms gua and lu (from the Hokkien 'goa' \u6211 and 'lu/li' \u4f60 \u2013 meaning 'I/ me' and 'you'). Almost all loan words in Indonesian with Chinese origin comes from Hokkien dialect. Loan words in Indonesian with Chinese origins., 2523=Vice versa, words of Malay-Indonesian origin also has been borrowed into English. Words borrowed into English (e.g., bamboo, orangutan, dugong, amok) generally entered through Malay language by way of British colonial presence in Malaysia and Singapore, similar to the way the Dutch have been borrowing words from the various native Indonesian languages. One exception is \"bantam\", derived from the name of the Indonesian province Banten in Western Java (see Oxford American Dictionary, 2005 edition). Another is \"lahar\" which is Javanese for a volcanic mudflow. Still other words taken into modern English from Malay/Indonesian probably have other origins (e.g., \"satay\" from Tamil, or \"ketchup\" from Chinese)., 103328=European influence over Indonesian language is significantly influenced through European intervention and colonialism, the most significant evident is the usage of Latin alphabet instead of various local scripts. Portuguese had first arrived in the archipelago and influenced the original Malay language after their conquest of Malacca. The Portuguese dominance over trade in the region and control of the spice island of Moluccas had significantly increase Portuguese influence in trade and also through the introduction of Christianity over the region. The Dutch however shows the most influence in the language, being in control of Indonesia for 300 years after eliminating the Portuguese as a player over control of the archipelago. Dutch language itself wasn't properly introduced over the archipelago before 1799 when the Netherlands' crown took over the colony from the already bankrupt VOC (Dutch East India company), previously the Malay language was adapted by VOC due to its trade and diplomatic benefit which led to mass loanword over the language. English to an extend also have influence over the archipelago's language, being the third most favored foreign language by the educated in the colonial days. English however plays more role over the nation's official language through recent globalization., 114695=The former colonial power, the Netherlands, left an extensive vocabulary that can be seen in words such as polisi (from politie = police), kualitas (from kwaliteit = quality), wortel (from wortel = carrot), kamar (from kamer = room, chamber), rokok (from roken = smoking cigarettes), korupsi (from corruptie = corruption), persneling (from versnelling = gear), kantor (from kantoor = office), resleting (from ritssluiting = zipper), kelas (from klas = class), and gratis (from gratis = free). These Dutch loanwords, and also from other non Italo-Iberian, European languages loanwords which came via Dutch, cover all aspects of life. Some Dutch loanwords, having clusters of several consonants, pose difficulties to speakers of Indonesian. This problem is usually solved by insertion of the schwa. For example Dutch schroef [\u02c8sxruf] \u2192 sekrup [s\u0259\u02c8krup]. Many Indonesian vocabulary ending \"-i\" (ie:administras-i) also are known from the Dutch vocabulary influence \"-ie\" (ie:administrat-ie). All the months from January (Januari) to December (Desember) used in Indonesian are also derived from Dutch language. It is estimated that 10,000 words in Indonesian language can be traced to the Dutch language. [4]}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Most of Indonesian languages vocabulary are natively derived from Malay, but some might be ultimately loanwords from Minang language. Yet it is unclear, since Malay and Minang are closely related, and some might consider that Minang language was precursor or old dialect of Malay language.[2] From Minangkabau[edit] From Austronesian languages[edit] List of loanwords[edit] Indonesian has also generalized brand names into common (lower-case) nouns as generic name. For example, \"sanyo\" refers to any electrical well pump, regardless of manufacturer or \"odol\" as all of toothpastes. This is similar to the type of generalization that occurs in English words like \"xerox\" or \"tampax\" or \"polaroid\". But the processes may also be \u2018out of period\u2019; for example, Indonesian words are still being concocted from Sanskrit, and the influence of the Dutch language certainly continued after the Dutch themselves left.[1] Modern Indonesian regularly adapts new words from other languages, particularly English. In contrast to the large number of mechanical terms borrowed from Dutch (e.g., automotive parts), hitech words are typically taken from English (e.g., internet). Dutch colonization and administration, lasting from the 17th century to the 20th, had an extensive impact on the vocabulary. As Dutch-trained linguists determined the rules for the official",
