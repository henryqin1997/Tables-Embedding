I really enjoyed the small class sizes, the accessibility of the campus, the resources and the classes I took., 448=EWU is good for all types of students! Its really ideal for students that are looking for a university experience without spending a lot of money.

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students EWU is great for all types of students. Even though we are small, we have quite a diverse population in both; ethnicity and career paths. Tips for prospective students Just be ready to become apart of the EWU family. The academic advisors are amazing, if you have any questions just give them a call and they can help you out. Bang for the buck I live a bit further away from Cheney, so I have a 40 minute commute. What I love about being a student at EWU is that you are able to ride the city transportation for free anytime you want. I love how clean and easy the bus system is because it saves me a lot of money not having to buy gas for my gas guzzler. Am enjoying being here Since EWU is on the smaller side, you really get the individual attention that one would not be able to get from going to a larger college. I also love how beautiful and manicured the campus is. Also, if you need to get away for a bit, Spokane is only 20 minutes away. Am learning a lot",
