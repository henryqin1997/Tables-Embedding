    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{40133=Generally speaking, the blanking period decreases with increasing slow wave frequency. The blanking period atgorithm is controlled by the microprocessor. The blanking period algorithm operates such that when the slow wave interval is shortened the blanking period is also shortened. This shortening may be performed in any manner, for example, in a linear fashion or in some other more complex monotonous fashion. After the blanking period, during a certain timing window, the microprocessor 46 is able to receive slow wave detection signals, which will not restart the pulse generator timing circuit, but will instead be interpreted as interference by the microprocessor 46. This timing window, interference detection timing window, may be up to seven seconds in duration after the sensed or paced event, preferably it is 100 milliseconds. To be precise, the combined blanking period and interference detection windows are shortened. Shortening may occur in any manner desired, i.e. in a linear fashion between a preset high or a preset low value or along a non-linear manner. The shortening of the combined blanking and interference detection interval will not occur once the combined blanking and interference detection window reaches a programmed value, such as 2.5 s. This combined blanking window may also be programmed to be turned off such that it does not change in response to sensed physiologic signals. In all circumstances, however, the interference detection window remains equal to at least 100 ms. For example, the rationale is that the typical main frequencies of power distribution are 50 Hz, 60 Hz, 400 Hz and 16.33 Hz. The lower harmonic for 1633 Hz is 8 Hz which corresponds to an interval of 125 ms. Of course the exact length of time for each period may be programmed by the physician. Moreover, each of the periods may be further made to be automatically adjusted based on the sensed electrical activity., 61397=FIG. 8 depicts the steps used in the stability criteria algorithm of the invention, i.e. the methodology through which the present invention determines whether or not the sensed slow wave rate of the GI tract is, to a sufficient degree, regular. As discussed above, chaotic slow waves which occur at chaotic intervals in time instead of in a normal rhythm may cause the symptoms of nausea or vomiting to occur in a patient. Thus the stability criteria rhythm permits the present invention to sense whether slow waves are occurring in a consistent fashion so that treatment may be delivered should they not occur in such a manner. As seen in step 8-1, the device determines the change in two consecutive intervals of the sensed slow waves. Next, the device proceeds to step 8-2 and adds the absolute values over N consecutive intervals from step 8-1 and determines it is less than a programmed stability value. If the change is less then the device proceeds to step 8-3 and provides a normal electrical stimulation. Step 8-3 corresponds to step 7-9 discussed above. If the value in step 8-2 is not less than the stability value, then the device has detected unstable slow waves and proceeds to step 8-4 to provide the appropriate electrical stimulation. In the preferred embodiment the stimulation delivered in step 8-4 consists of stimulation of between 1.05-1.35 times the sensed slow wave rate or 2-7 times the slow wave rate. Of course, each of these values may be programmed depending upon the circumstances of use of the device, the patient, organ and preference of the attending physician., 63138=FIG. 9 depicts the electrical stimulation delivered in the normal mode of the device. Electrical stimulation preferably consists of a pulse train delivered at a rate of between 7-27 bpm with 12 bpm preferred. As seen, the pulse train preferred consists of two pulses, the pulse having an amplitude A, a pulse width PW and an inter pulse interval II. II may be anywhere between 6-600 ms in length with 60 ms preferred, A is between 1-50 milliamps with 5 milliamps preferred and pulse width is between 3-1000 microsecs with 330 microsecs preferred. Moreover, although the pulse train consisting of two pulses is preferred, any number of pulses between 1-100 may be used. As discussed above, the exact parameters selected depend not only on the organ to be stimulated but also upon the patient's physiology as well as on the preference of the physician attending.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although a specific embodiment of the invention has been disclosed, this is done for the purposes of illustration and is not intended to be limiting with regard to the scope of the invention. It is contemplated that various substitutions, alterations, and/or modifications, including but not limited to those specifically discussed herein, may be made to the disclosed embodiment of the invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims, which follow. One of the advantages of having the control processor 30 configured as shown in FIG. 12 (to provide both the basic stimulation function and supplemental stimulation functions) is that the control programs for the supplemental stimulation function(s) can be altered (upgraded with a new program) at the same time that the basic stimulation function continues to operate. Thus, there need be no interruption in the basic stimulation function provided by the stimulator as one or more control programs are downloaded to the memory 40. As the downloading operation could take several minutes, this is an important advantage because it means the patient need not go without the therapeutic stimulation pulses provided by the stimulator. As seen in FIG. 12, the control processor 30 is effectively divided into two portions: (1) a portion that controls the basic stimulation functions, comprising the state logic 50 and the pulse generator (PG) timing circuits 52; and (2) a portion that controls",
