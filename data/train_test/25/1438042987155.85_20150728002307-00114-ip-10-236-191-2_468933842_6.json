    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{17305=Certain heretofore known apparatus for the treatment of stenoses employ balloons which are inflated subsequent to introduction of a balloon carrier, such as a catheter, into the body cavity. The balloon constitutes or is affixed to the distal end of the catheter and is inflated when the distal end of the catheter reaches an occlusion or a stenosis. A drawback of such apparatus (reference may be had, for example, to German Utility Model No. G 88 05 709.7 of Angiomedics, published Sep. 15, 1988) is that the balloon cannot be introduced into a very narrow constriction and cannot penetrate into an occlusion in a relatively narrow blood vessel or another body cavity., 22254=German Pat. No. 34 19 962 to Okada (granted Mar. 1, 1990) discloses a high-frequency incision and excision apparatus which is designed for removal of polyps and operates with a wire loop., 22799=German Utility Model No. G 73 26 151.5 of Wolf (published Oct. 4, 1973) discloses an endoscopic coagulation probe wherein a hollow metallic head is inserted into the distal end of a flexible hose and is filled with a heat-resistant material. The heat-resistant material confines an electric heating element for the head, and the conductors connecting such heating element with an energy source extend from the distal end to the proximal end of the hose. The hose can be replaced with a tube., 20674=European patent application No. 0 316 796 of DonMichael et al. (published May 24, 1989) discloses an intravascular ultrasonic catheter probe which employs a wire with a bulbous tip at the distal end. The proximal end of the wire is connected with an ultrasonic energy source, and the major part of the wire is confined in a hollow catheter. The distal end of the wire is retracted into the catheter during introduction into a blood vessel, and the bulbous distal end is thereupon expelled from the distal end of the catheter to act upon a stenosis while the energy source is active to vibrate the wire. The distal end of the wire is necessarily small because it must be capable of passing through the catheter. A small distal end is likely to perforate and/or otherwise damage the wall surrounding a body cavity., 22461=European patent application No. 0 177 782 of Auth (published Apr. 16, 1986) discloses a transluminal thrombectomy apparatus wherein a drive shaft is rotated to withdraw the fibrin of the thrombus and to thus establish a path for the flow of blood. The major part of the shaft is confined in a flexible tubular housing., 21506=German patent application No. 38 02 550 of Borodulin et al. (published Aug. 11, 1988) discloses a vibratory probe within a deformable bulbous distal end of a catheter. The distal end of the probe repeatedly expands the distal end of the catheter radially and axially to thus push a foreign body (such as a stone) through the body cavity. The apparatus of Borodulin can shift mobile foreign bodies in a urinary tract or in another body cavity but is highly unlikely to successfully attack a stenosis or an occlusion in a blood vessel because the radially and axially expandable bulbous distal end of the catheter is actually a balloon which is too soft to be useful in connection with the treatment of stenoses and/or occlusions.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Without further analysis, the foregoing will so fully reveal the gist of the present invention that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily adapt it for various applications without omitting features that, from the standpoint of prior art, fairly constitute essential characteristics of the generic and specific aspects of my contribution to the art and, therefore, such adaptations should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalence of the appended claims. The improved apparatus is susceptible of many additional modifications without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, the hammer 6\" of FIG. 4 can be equipped with an electric heating element which is connected to a suitable energy source by conductor means, not shown. The major part of the probe 4\" can be electrically insulated but the hammer 6\" (which contains or carries the sensor 9) is not insulated. This renders it possible to heat the hammer 6\" (and hence the distal end 2\") to a desired temperature by resorting to the source of high-frequency energy 10 or in another suitable way. Proper heating of the distal end 2\" renders it possible to smoothen the wall around a body cavity which contains an occlusion or a stenosis without injuring the wall. The heating and smoothing action can be carried out while the hammer 6\" is in the process of repeatedly striking the anvil 8\" or thereafter. Furthermore, the",
