            "There is a police force on campus. There are also plenty of police call boxes. There is a check in policy after specific times through out the week in the dorms. I never feel unsafe on campus.",
            "There are 7 sororities and 8 fraternities.",
            "Over 200 clubs and most activities on campus are either free or $1-$5. There are comedians, concerts, plays. There is always something to go to or do. We even have unusual clubs such as the quidditch club, zombies versus humans, and squirrel loving club.",
            "Western has something for everyone. We have most programs people are looking for. It is a great school for any health profession, with connections to the local hospitals and onsite clinics as well as a new med school, business with career fairs and job shadowing, engineering, aviation, and music/theater.",
            "The tuition is reasonable for what you get. It is super accessible with financial aid, FASFA, and scholarships. Most things for students are free, such as football games, hockey, as well as the campus and city busses. There is also a clinic on campus that offers anything form a general check up to getting x-rays. All the professors are super nice, understanding, and know the material. The class sizes can range from 30-200 people.",
            "There are plenty of events to go to around campus. Miller Auditorium almost always has a show playing, many of them are Off Broadway and usually fairly cheap for students. There are also comedians who come, and plenty of bands. Our football and Hockey games are all super exciting, not to mention free for students. There is also something going on in Downtown Kalamazoo, whether it is a cultural festival or just shopping around. Kalamazoo is also 2.5 hrs way from Chicago and 45 min away from Lake Michigan.",
            "The food is somewhat decent. It's not complete fine dining or always like a home cooked meal. They have a gluten free fridge stocked in every cafeteria, plenty of options for vegetarians and vegans, and they have a gigantic salad bar as well.",
            "Everything in the dorms are run super efficiently. We have plenty of activities going on in the dorm. For example, on Halloween we had a haunted basement. It is a great way to meet new people and have the college experience. = The RAs are all super nice and personable as well as the LCAs.",
            "As long as you go to class and pay attention it is not that difficult. Most of the professors are up front about how there exams are structured and what is going to be on them. There are plenty of classes to choose from with different difficulties so you can make your schedule a mix of both harder classes and easier classes.",
            "If you plan on coming to Western Michigan University join a student organization, there are plenty that each student should be able to fit into one. Make connections with your professors, they are all super approachable and super nice.",
            "Western Michigan has a little bit of everything, so no matter where you are you will always feel at home. There are over 200 student organizations from students to choose from, the professors are some of the nicest you'll meet, and the campus is gorgeous and full of life. Western has plenty to offer so hopefully you will bleed brown and gold."

May be a little hot when you first get here. NO AC., 484718=There is so much. Go to sporting events is one way or participate in some of the Student Organizations. There are also numerous events that the Campus Activities Board puts together each year, including several a month. These events range from concerts to movies. Miller Auditorium also has great shows and concerts every year in which students get 50% of tickets. Students can exercise at the Rec Center or Ice Skate and Swim at Lawson. There is also always Bronco BASH in September., 28857=WMU has been name one of the top schools in 2011 already! You can look up facts about the school and they are all true. We have a great College of Aviation and also Business College. WMU is for someone that is sociable and if not you will turn into one. It's for a student that loves to be interactive. This is a place for someone that will represent their university with pride. If you have great heart and spirit come to WMU because it's always a great day to be a BRONCO!, 268577=There are vehicles starting at 9:00 that you can call to pick you up where ever you may be on campus and take you to the location you desire around the campus for your safety. Also there are 911 stands everywhere so that if you get in trouble you can always push the button and get help where ever you may need it., 4860=I'm a physics student, but I've found philosophy and chemistry to be strong areas in this college. I haven't experienced much in my one semester here, but Chem 1100, 1110, Philosophy of Science (honors), and music appreciation to be well worth while., 564162=One big tradition that we have here at Western is called Bronco Bash!! this happens every year during like the first week of September where all different types of school clubs/organizations as well as businesses , restaurants etc. comes on campus to promote their business and/or organizations and gives away a lot of FREE stuff!!, 52248=The overall tuition ranks fairly low compared to the rest of the public University's in Michigan. Last I checked it was 13th out of 15th in terms of the highest priced as of 2008 (1st being the most expensive). Also, it is ranked as one of the top public University's year after year according to US News. So, it really is a great deal, but my only complaint is that although tuition is low, living on campus is expensive with a lot of nickel and dime fees that can annoy you (parking passes, Wired internet fees, mini fridge rentals, etc.), however as a freshmen you don't have to live on campus, and is something to consider based on your financial situation., 900558=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here Life here has been swell, I've only found myself complaining about the location of the Valley dorms and that the Gold Bus is usually full. Am learning a lot I have to say, I thought Gen. Ed's would be boring, but I have found one in each area that has kept my interest. I must say though if ever you get a chance to be in a class by Prof. Tim McGrew, do not pass up the opportunity. McGrew has been one of the best instructors I've had, ever.
