No. 5,507,813, Dowd, et al., issued Apr. 16, 1996, incorporated by reference.) Preferably, the bone is autologous bone or donated from a single member of the same species as the patient to reduce or prevent an immunogenic response. However, bone from multiple donors can be used in the compositions., 82109=Embodiments of the bone repairing composition can be used to correct bone defects in orthopedic, neurosurgical plastic, or reconstructive surgery, in periodontal procedures, and in endodontic procedures. Examples include repair of simple and compound fractures and non-unions, external and internal fixations, joint reconstructions such as arthrodesis, general arthroplasty, cup arthroplasty of the hip, femoral and humeral head replacement, femoral head surface replacement and total joint replacement, repairs of the vertebral column including spinal fusion and internal fixation, tumor surgery, e.g. deficit filling, discectomy, laminectomy, excision of spinal cord tumors, anterial cervical and thoracic operations, repair of spinal injuries, scoliosis, lordosis and kyphosis treatments, intermaxillary fixation of fractures, mentoplasty, temporomandibular joint replacement, alveolar ridge augmentation and reconstruction, inlay bone grafts, implant placement and revision, sinus lifts, etc. The standard surgical and dental procedures are suitable for use with the various methods. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,180,606, Chen, et al., issued Jan. 30, 2001 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,507,813, Dowd, et al., issued Apr. 16, 1996.), 85069=The composition can be made pliable to soften the device, allowing for easy manipulation and fit into the defect site. Suitable methods include application of heat or hydration by the direct application of warm aqueous based solutions to the formed composition. In various embodiments, a heating element can be used to transfer thermal energy to the formed composition. Suitable heating elements can use electrical, mechanical or chemical means to generate the thermal energy. For example, a heat pack can include a self-contained and user activated exothermic chemical means to generate heat and the pack can be disposed adjacent to or enclose a receptacle containing the formed composition. Upon initiating the exothermic reaction, heat is transferred through the heat pack and to the formed composition. Exemplary heating devices are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,263,991, Wiley, et al, issued Nov. 23, 1993, incorporated by reference. It is understood that the appropriate temperature and timing of the heat application depends on the dimensions, quantity and contents of the formed composition(s) and the selected heating techniques., 40910=This application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/964,950, filed on Oct. 14, 2004, now abandoned, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference., 42127=Bone reconstruction can be performed with various pastes, gels, or putty-like materials containing a natural collagen or human cadaveric donor bone base. Preferably, compositions are prepared from demineralized allograft bone matrix (DBM) that is taken from cadavers. The sterile DBM is available in cubes, shavings, or powder and is freeze-dried. Because the DBM is dry and difficult to manipulate, it can be made flowable or malleable with the addition of a wetting agent. The patient's blood has been used to mix the bone, bone powder, or collagen because blood offers the benefits of being available at the operative site, is non-immunogenic to the patient and contains proteins, monosaccharides, polysaccharides, and glucoronic acid which increase the healing process and regeneration of bone. Other wetting agents include monosaccharides, disaccharides, water dispersible oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, low weight organic solvents, including glycerol, polyhydroxy compounds, such as mucopolysaccharide or polyuronic acid, and various aqueous solutions. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,558, O'Leary et al., issued Mar. 1, 1994; U.S. Pat. No. 5,073,373, O'Leary et al., issued Dec. 17, 1991; U.S. Pat. No. 5,314,476, Prewett, et al., issued May 27, 1994; U.S. Pat. No. 5,507,813, Dowd, et al., issued Apr. 16, 1996; U.S. Pat. No. 4,191,747, Scheicher, issued Mar. 4, 1980; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,172,128, Thiele, et al., issued Oct. 23, 1979.) Compounds like GRAFTON\ufffd (Available from Osteotech, Inc., Eatontown, N.J., USA), a glycerol based, non-cross linkable composition and collagen suspended in various inert polyhydroxy compounds, are also used to make the demineralized bone malleable. Regardless of the exact components, a primary goal in bone reconstruction is that the filler be highly effective in inducing bone formation, become an integrated fixture at the application site and not become dislodged., 94635=The hydration media 140 is preferably an aqueous solution including, but not limited to, saline, water or a balanced salt solution (e.g., 1140 ml NaCl, 5.4 ml KCl, pH 7.6). Various forms of aqueous hydration media 140 also include blood including, but not limited to, whole blood and blood components such as, red blood cells and components, white blood cells and components, plasma, plasma fractions, plasma serum, platelet concentrate, blood proteins, thrombin, and coagulation factors. As further detailed, later herein, a pressure differential draws the hydration media 140 into the chamber 124 of the retaining tube 112., 60998=In various embodiments, the bone material can additionally comprise bone chips. The bone chips can be natural or demineralized. The bone chips range from about 750 to about 2000 microns, preferably from about 750 to about 1500 microns., 59621=The \u201cbone material\u201d component of the present teachings is selected from bone powder, bone chips, bone shavings, and mixtures thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the bone material is dried demineralized bone powder. Suitable drying techniques include freeze drying, vacuum drying, air drying, temperature flux drying, molecular sieve drying, and other appropriate techniques. Preferably, the bone material comprises freeze dried bone. As used herein, the term \u201cfreeze dried\u201d or \u201clyophilization\u201d and variants thereof, means the process of isolating a solid substance from solution by freezing the solution and evaporating the ice under a vacuum. The dried bone material has a final moisture level of about less than 6% as recommended by the American Association of Tissue Banks. As used herein, the term \u201cdemineralized\u201d and variants thereof, means a loss or decrease of the mineral constituents or mineral salts of the individual tissues or bone relative to their natural state. Preferably, the demineralized bone has a calcium concentration of about 1%. The demineralized bone powder has a particle size of less than about 1500 microns, more preferably less than about 1000 microns and more preferably, less than about 850 microns. In another preferred embodiment, the demineralized bone material has a particle size less than about 710 microns., 105795=Cancellous bone is harvested and adherent tissue are removed. The bone is milled into particles of 1500 microns and 810 microns. The bone is soaked in a solution of 100% ethanol, volume to volume, in deionized/distilled water to remove fat and kill microorganisms. The larger (1500 microns) bone particles are set aside. The smaller (810 microns) bone particles are placed in a 0.5 N hydrochloric acid bath and soaked overnight. The calcium ion concentration of the bone particles is monitored by measuring the ion concentration of the acid solution with a calcium specific electrode. The calcium concentration reaches 1% and the bone is removed from the acid bath. The de-calcified bone is washed with deionized/distilled water until the runoff rinse solution reaches a neutral pH level. To prepare a bone repairing composition, 25 grams of the demineralized bone (1% calcium, 810 microns) is mixed with 100 grams of a saline solution. The mixture is autoclaved at 121\ufffd C. under a pressure of 15 psi for 60 minutes to form the gel carrier. The carrier is mixed with 28 grams of demineralized bone (1% calcium, 810 microns) and a paste is formed. Additionally, 2.8 grams of the reserved natural bone chips (1500 microns) are added to the paste. The paste is spread into a square shaped mold using a spatula. The mold and paste are placed inside of a sterilized Tyvek\ufffdMylar\ufffd dual chamber package. Moisture is withdrawn from the package by lyophilization and removed until the moisture content in the paste is less than about 6% of the cast weight. The freeze dried formed bone composition is a square patch measuring 4 cm\ufffd4 cm and having a thickness of 0.3 cm., 62956=The relative percentages of the bone material and carrier component may vary based on the amounts of each component used and the addition of other materials such as bone building materials. As used herein, a \u201cbone building material\u201d is a compound that stimulates the growth of bone to replace the bone repairing composition. \u201cBone building material\u201d includes calcium containing materials, nutrient factors, bone morphogenic proteins, growth factors, antibiotics, antimicrobials, anti-inflammatory agents, blood products, and mixtures thereof. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,180,606, Chen, et al., issued Jan. 30, 2001, incorporated by reference.) Depending on the bone building material or materials selected, the composition is osteogenic and osteoinductive. The bone building materials can be contained in or coated onto the surface of the composition., 61266=The carrier component is comprised of demineralized bone and an aqueous solution. The carrier component particles sizes are less than about 1500 microns, more preferably less than about 1000 microns and more preferably, less than about 850 microns. In another preferred embodiment, the demineralized bone material has a particle size less than about 710 microns., 70826=In various embodiments, the bone is milled into particles ranging from about 700 microns to about 2000 microns. As used herein, the term \u201cmilled\u201d and conjugations thereof, refers to shaping a tissue to the desired size by crushing, chopping, cutting, shaving, grinding, or pulverizing. In embodiments where several sizes of bone are be used, it is understood that the milling process can be repeated and the respective bone portions can be reserved and assigned accordingly. Commercially available milling and sieving devices can be used or bone can be purchased in the form of an allograft matrix in the desired particle size or sizes., 62001=In various embodiments, autoclaving the carrier component results in the bone and water or saline mixture forming a gel or having a gel like consistency. As used herein, \u201cautoclaving,\u201d and its variants, refers to a thermal procedure, such as that used for sterilization, where the solution is placed in a sealed chamber and subjected to high temperature and pressure. Specific autoclaving methods among those useful herein are further described in the methods section below. Methods among those useful herein are also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,576,249, Gendler et al., issued Jun. 10, 2003, incorporated by reference herein.}",
