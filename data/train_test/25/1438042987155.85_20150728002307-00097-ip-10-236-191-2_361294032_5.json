    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{61286=The #19 shirt has been worn by nine players previously and was actually worn by six different player's in the club's first five years. Those were Josh Keller, Jeff Zaun, Yuri Lavrinenko, Chad Prince and David Vaudreuil before Craig Capano donned the shirt from 2002-2004. Jim Curtin's little brother Jeff wore #19 in 2007 while Corben Bone was the most recent #19 from 2010-2013.\u00a0, 59387=Coincidentally, the Fire acquired Mapp from D.C. United for Dema Kovalenko prior to the start of the 2003 MLS campaign. Kovalenko sits fourth on the club's All Competitions goal scoring list with 26, while Mapp sits fourth on the All Competitions assists list with 35., 27428=In Regular Season terms, the six he scored in LA (three of which came against the Fire on Opening Day) combined with the nine he's tallied for the Men in Red since May have him second in the MLS Golden Boot Race with 15., 33113=\u2014 Gonzalo Segares (@supersega13) September 17, 2013, 39445=Lubos Kubik (#5 from 1998-2000), 56741=DaMarcus Beasley (#7 from 2000-2004), 56501=John Thorrington (#7 from 2005-2006), 38414=Cory Gibbs (#5 from 2011-2012), 47875=In Corrales' case, while he never played for another MLS club other than San Jose after being traded back to the Quakes in 2001, he did spend a few years abroad in Norway with HamKam that keep him out of the consecutive seasons count. Corrales spent a total of 12 seasons in San Jose over three stints (1996-97, 2001-04, 2008-13), 32519=...since his memorable debut in the team's comeback win at Chivas USA on May 4, 2012. You remember that one -- Berry, was plugged into the lineup next to Arne Friedrich after Jalil Anibaba earned a one-game suspension in the previous match., 31507=Maybe its a bit premature but thought this would be interesting as well. Sean Johnson hit 100 competitive appearances for the Fire in his return from Gold Cup duty in the team's 2-1 win at Philadelphia on August 3.\u00a0, 27507=Mike Magee already has double-digit goals in 2013.\u00a0, 59468=Justin Mapp (2003-2010), 34243=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0UPDATE!\u00a0\u00a0 Upon further review, an inconsistency existed in Elias and Opta's stats. Elias listed Segares with six yellow cards in 2013 but as I looked at the MLS Disciplinary Report this morning, I saw him with seven. After some quick deduction, I realized Elias (and hence myself) failed to count Segares' 86th minute yellow card in the July 3 match vs. \u00a0San Jose., 66551=Though 34 isn\u2019t the most common soccer number, two Fire players have worn it before. Former Trinidad & Tobago international Osei Telesford was the club\u2019s #34 in 2007 while Austin Washington wore it from 2008-2009., 59695=Dema Kovalenko (1999-2002), 43905=2001-2004; 2008-2013, 56166=Other #7's in Chicago Fire History:\u00a0Manny Lagos (1998), Paul Dougherty (1999), Alexandre Boucicaut (2004), Stefan Dimitrov (2010), Mike Banner (2011), Sherjill MacDonald (2012-2013)., 53591=A third round pick in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft, Chicago Fire midfielder Logan Pause had already capped off a decade with the Men in Red last year before extending his deal to come back for a 12th season with the club in 2014 on Friday., 31763=The only games he has missed? Friendlies against Santos Laguna in 2012 and Club America this past July., 39192=Jim Curtin (#5 from 2001-2007), 66995=Let\u2019s start with the Hurtado. The 29-year-old center back will continue to don the same #34 he wore for five seasons in Cascadia. Asked why he\u2019s chosen a somewhat \u201coff the beaten path\u201d soccer number, Hurtado explained 34 was the number he was given when trialing with AC Milan in early 2009., 53272=Logan's longevity got me thinking about players that held the longest consecutive tenures in terms of both years and games played ith one MLS club. After some research, I found that Fire legend and new assistant coach C.J. Brown holds the record for consecutive seasons with one team at 13, while Logan will tie Cobi Jones (LA Galaxy) and Pablo Mastroeni (Colorado Rapids) when he makes his first appearance for the Fire in 2014.\u00a0, 60735=Most notably, Chad Barrett (pictured above) switched to the #19 shirt in 2008 when the club acquired Tomasz Frankowski who moved into the #9 shirt. Barrett wore #19 for half a season before being dealt to Toronto FC in the Brian McBride trade that August. So in closing, Harry has the chance to really make #19 his own., 38702=Tim Ward (#5 from 2009-2010), 64440=ANSWER: Brian Bates (1998), Tom Soehn (1998-2000), Sergi Daniv (2001), Kelly Gray (2002-2005), Brandon Prideaux (2008-2009), Julio Martinez (2010), Peter Lowry (2010), Jalil Anibaba (2011-2013)., 34517=\u2014 Gonzalo Segares (@supersega13) September 17, 2013, 57210=After two years of being the only #71 in Chicago Fire history, Brazilian midfielder Alex has decided to move to a more traditional soccer number in 2014 and will now wear #7., 56255=Logan Pause (#7 from 2007-2008)}",
