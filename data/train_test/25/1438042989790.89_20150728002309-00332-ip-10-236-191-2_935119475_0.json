    "textAfterTable": "Because sizing and cut will vary between brands, please use this chart as a general guide. If you are between sizes or need assistance selecting the proper size, please contact Customer Service Designer Chilean-born designer Maria Cornejo opened her atelier, Zero, when she transformed a raw space in New York in 1998. The name Zero represents that point of departure and Cornejo's pure vision for the spare and architectural. In 2005, the designer\u2019s long-time friend Marysia Woroniecka joined her on her quest and they expanded the company. Informed by circular shapes with imaginative draping and dramatic angles, Zero + Maria Cornejo clothing is often designed from one continuous piece of fabric.
