I felt for the most part like it was a lackluster collection of mediocre efforts, even by some artists I really respect. This CD is totally different. It has a depth, groove, and energy that makes you want to stand up, dance around, and praise God. Highly recommended!!, 129572=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc. All rights reserved.}",
