Not only has he ranked third on DJ Magazine's Top 100 DJs list the last two years running, he's also garnered back-to-back Grammy award nominations \u2013 once for his work on \"Sunshine\" with David Guetta in 2012 and again for his own song \"Levels in 2013.\", 2625=Avicii's \"Wake Me Up,\" served as the lead single from his album \"True,\" which was released on September 17. It hit the #1 spot on the Spotify Global Chart and was at No. 2 for most streamed artist worldwide. \"Wake Me Up\" was also the UK's fastest-selling single of the year, selling 267,000 copies in its first week on sale, and eventually topping the charts in over 20 countries., 3033=You already know if you're reading this, but when Avicii plays, people stop in their tracks. His melodies and his productions have captivated fans around the world. This Swede has come so far in such a short amount of time, and earned the No. 6 spot on the list of Top 100 DJs by DJ Magazine in 2011. A year later he improved to No. 3, and may very well rise to the top of the list in 2013., 5269=Of course last year there was also the huge success of \"Wake Me Up,\" which became the UK's fastest-selling single of 2013 and topped the charts in over 20 countries. Realistically, how did Avicii expect to top the success? Well first he released the single \"Hey Brother,\" with vocals by Dan Tyminski. Then in November 2013 he won his first award for Best Electronic at the MTV EMA's.

In an interview with Rolling Stone, Mr. Berling makes the valid point that EDM\u2026, 4746=It's hard to believe that 2014 could have been even busier for this phenomenal young talent, but it has been. New projects and music have come fast and furious, beginning with January's launch of \"NRJ AVICII,\" a web radio station which plays songs only by Avicii. Then he announced a collaboration with Madonna, released a remixed edition of his album \"True,\" worked with Chris Martin from Coldplay, co-produced again with David Guetta, collaborated with Wyclef Jean, and told Rolling Stone in July he had 70 songs for his next album., 3510=You're talking about a guy who spent hours, days and weeks in his home studio crafting one track after another. The best part is, people wanted to listen. Sure, his music was inspired by the likes of Laidback Luke and Steve Angello, but people only heard Aviccii during playback. By April 2007, he released \"Manman\" on Pete Tong's Bedroom Bedlam label. After the release, he was bombarded by labels, promoters and booking agencies around the globe., 4174=Though Avicii had to cancel the remainder of his 2014 tour dates due to health concerns, he did release a new single call \"The Days,\" followed by an announcement he would debut a brand new song called \"The Nights\" in the game FIFA 15.}",
