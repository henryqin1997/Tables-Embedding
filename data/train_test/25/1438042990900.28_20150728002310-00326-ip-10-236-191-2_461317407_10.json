After the video signals exit the filter module, the video signals are joined with the off-air video signals onto a single cable (line 8). Placing all of the video signals on the single cable allows the subscriber to plug the single cable into the subscriber owned equipment and obtain all of the video services. Prior to being transmitted out of the filter module, each of the video signals are preferably joined onto a single cable. After being joined onto the single cable, the video signals are preferably amplified using a conventional amplifier. The conventional amplifier returns the video signals to a level that is needed for use by the subscriber. After the system services signal passes through the RF modulator, the system services signal passes through a controller. Similar to the other controllers, the controller is controlled by a signal from the control service module that is transmitted to the controller through the master controller. The filter module also preferably include system services video and audio signals (line 6). While line 6 indicates that the system services are brought in on a single cable, one of skill in the art will appreciate that separate cables can be",
