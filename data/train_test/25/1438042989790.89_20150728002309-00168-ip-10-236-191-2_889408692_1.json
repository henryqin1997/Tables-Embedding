Opened in 2001, the stadium sits on what used to be Three Rivers Stadium which was the old home of the Steelers and MLB's Pittsburgh Pirates. The $281 million facility sits adjacent to the Ohio River in the North Shore neighborhood and is named after Pittsburgh-based H.J. Heinz Company, which earned the naming rights as the stadium was built. When designing the stadium, Pittsburgh's rich steel history was the focus as nearly 12,000 tons of the material was used in the rugged looking building. Every Steelers home game has sold out since moving to Heinz Field, a record that actually dates back to the 1972 season. The 65,050-seat venue also played host to the 2011 NHL Winter Classic, a 3-1 victory for the visiting Washington Capitals over the Pittsburgh Penguins. Heinz Field is home to a unique concourse structure that includes the Great Hall, a 40,000 square-foot area depicting important events in Steelers history. A plethora of murals and memorabilia make up the impressive shrine of the historic franchises gloried past, including actual lockers of Franco Harris and Joe Greene. Despite already being one of the NFL's largest stadiums, Heinz Field will be expanding by approximately 3,000 seats, with plans to begin the project immediately following approval from the league., 2609=Little Big Town have been touring behind their new album Pain Killer since November, and based on their recent announcement have no plans of slowing down.
