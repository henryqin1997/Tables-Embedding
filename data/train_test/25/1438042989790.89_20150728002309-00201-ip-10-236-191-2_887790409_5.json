    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{5350=Arctic Monkeys toured heavily in 2011 on their \"Suck It and See\" Tour. They headlined the popular Benicassim Festival in Spain along side artists like The Strokes, Arcade Fire and Primal Scream. The group continued to tear up the festival circuit when it dropped in to play Super Bock Super Rock, V Festival, Rock Werchter and T in The Park. The band also managed to squeeze in a pair of homecoming shows at the Don Valley Bowl in Sheffield, with supporting acts like Dead Sons and The Vaccines. As their popularity continued to skyrocket, they eventually played Lollapalooza., 3961=The band will once again appear at a number of European festivals in 2013 in support of their upcoming album. Other tour dates have not yet been announced., 6768=No, the band hasn't replaced or cut down on its bombastic live shows. But the U.S. tour will cater to smaller crowds and club venues instead of huge stadiums and outdoor amphitheaters, giving the band the best of both worlds as it heads toward the end of 2013. But don't mistake the smaller crowds for the assumption that the band just isn't as popular in the States \u2013 because you'd be dead wrong. Many of the venues, in fact, have sold out weeks in advance., 4746=In early 2012, the band confirmed it had recorded brand new music set for a summer release and would also return to the studio to record its next album.

Not surprisingly, Arctic Monkey tickets sold quickly. the Arctic Monkeys continued to release albums, including \"Favourite Worst Nightmare\" in 2007, \"Humbug\" in 2009, and \"Suck It and See\" in 2011. The Arctic Monkey's biggest claim to fame is not their albums, however. The band is one of the first to gain public attention via the Internet. Arctic Monkey fan sites gained popularity, and Arctic Monkey ticketsalso became more popular., 3731=The Arctic Monkeys formed in 2002 in High Green, a suburb of Sheffield, England. The band's current lineup is Alex Turner (lead vocals and lead guitar), Jamie Cook (rhythm guitar and vocals), Nick O'Maley (bass and vocals), Matt Helders (percussion and vocals). John Ashton joins the band as a touring member on keyboard, guitar and backup vocals., 1946=This year, lady-driven punk-rock outfit Screaming Females released the 14-track live album Live at the Hideout so that their fans could experience their raucous live shows whenever they wanted. Well, now fans in the U.S. can experience their live shows\u2026for real. They\u2019re going out on tour for a month-long jaunt, starting October 2 in Baltimore,\u2026, 6292=The trek is part of the band's promotion for its latest album, \"A.M.,\" which bowed on September 9, 2013.
