            "There's always so much to do in the city year-round! Literally, you can walk outside and there's something going on. There so many cool areas to explore and so many things to try.",
            "For cafeteria food, it's not that bad. But for the amount of money you're paying for it, it could be better.",
            "I think it's great! The rooms really aren't like your typical dorms. They're really big (for college dorm standards) and nice. There's also a lot of activities within the dorm building as well, so it's easy to meet people.",
            "Columbia's not what you'd expect from your typical arts school. The teachers and advisors do challenge you and push you, mainly because they can see what you are capable of and what you can accomplish. But it's all a matter of determination and focus.",
            "I'd apply as early as possible. The earlier you apply, the sooner you'll know if you got in. Also, there's a greater chance that you'll get your ideal living space (if you're staying on campus) when you apply for that as early as possible.",
            "It's a really great school. The teachers here know what they're doing and there's always help if you need it. Also, it's in one of the greatest cities in the country, too!"

The average amount you will spend at those places is $7. I usually cook a meal at home. Get your food from Jewel(near 1104 Wabash) or take the train and go to Walmart. If you really have to, go to Target.

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Definitely search for internships and other things to gain experience in your profession. This school wants you to get out there and make a name for yourself. Get out of your dorm room work hard and experience the city, the school, and just enjoy your time here. It is up to you if you want your name out there. Bang for the buck As for the education, you do really get the education you want for your money. The room and board is the only thing that is a bit expensive, but it is all understandable because of the campuses location being downtown. Those students who live on campus in the downtown loop are close to everything which makes it all worth it. Am enjoying being here I love being apart of Columbia. It is a wonderful place where beginning artists all around the world come to learn and hone their craft. The location of the campus is wonderful. Am learning a lot I learn from not only my professors but also the fellow students around me. The professors not only work for the school but also have careers in their fields within the city. They all encourage students",
