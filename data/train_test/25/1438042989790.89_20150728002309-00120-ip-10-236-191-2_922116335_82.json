            "There is always an emergency phone and alarm with an illuminated node within eyesight from every point on campus. Also there is a shuttle service to provide students a ride home late at night.",
            "All sorts of fraterneties and sororities from social, educational, and service groups.",
            "Every year there is a activities fair where hundreds of clubs give out information about clubs and activities. They also give out free tshirts, pens, and a bunch of other cool things.",
            "Students who love discussions.",
            "The Cathedral of Learning's Victory light is illuminated after every football victory. Many students sleep by the homerun plate in David Lawrence Hall where Babe Ruth hit his last 3 homeruns for good luck.",
            "I feel like I got more than just a classroom education for my money.",
            "There's so much depending on what your interest is. If sports, Pittsburgh has Steelers football, Panthers basketball, and Penguin hockey. If music Carnegie Hall is right across the street. If diverse cultural dining, than Oakland, Squirell Hill, and Shady Side provide great restaurants. If knowledge, then Carnegie Art & Natural History Musem, Carnegie Public Library, and Carnegie Science Center are must see places.",
            "Just newly renovated dining halls and revamped menus. Also you can use dollars at Einstein's Bros. Bagels, Taco Bell, Burger King, and Starbucks coffee carts. Great selections.",
            "RSA and ResLife work together to provide great fun programs for residents. RAs and RDs really get to know each of the residents. I met my best friends for life in my freshman dorm.",
            "Teachers expect students to work hard and submit their best. This is what I loved about Pitt.",
            "Keep your ears and ears open for opportunites. Keep your mind open to new ideas.",
            "Great programs to help cater to your visions and provide avenues to help learn more about a field and also yourself. There is a great environment that encourages interaction between innovative students of all disciplines."

It might not be New York or L.A., but it's pretty close and has just about everything you'd expect from a city., 751244=Put yourself out there as much as you can in your first week. It's a big school and is easy to get lost in, so being involved can really make your experience 1000 times better., 415963=I feel very safe. Especially after the bomb threats during the Spring of 2012 semester., 270404=There's a lot of review in most below-1000-level classes if you've taken a course on it before (in high school, for example) but it's worth it and the teachers do build on it. Once you get to the upper levels it's mostly new knowledge., 170674=At the University of Pittsburgh, there is a large Arena called the Peterson Events Center, otherwise known as the Pete. There is a large field outside right outside there and every year, Univ. of Pittsburgh plans an event for Freshman students to break a world record of some sort. This past year of 2012, Univ. of Pittsburgh Class of 2016 broke the world record of the largest uniformed dance with umbrellas dancing to the Cupid Shuffle for 6 minutes. This field is also known by students to play Ultimate Frisbee, Croquet, Football, Volleyball, Tanning, etc., 526885=Definitely study, study, study. Join as many clubs as you can handle in high school. Keep your GPA above a 3.5, and aim for at least a 1200 on the math and reading section of the SAT, and you will be guaranteed entrance to the University., 1013494=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 601016=The Cathedral of Learning (42 stories, 535 feet tall, 2529 windows) is the largest academic building in the United States. The building is Pitt's landmark and provides wonderful views of campus from the Unversity Honors College on the 35th and 36th floors., 220278=If you're in-state, you're definitely getting a good deal. Pitt is just as good as private schools that charge twice as much. Obviously the out of state tuition is one of the highest in the country, but I still think it's a pretty decent deal. You get so many opportunities that small schools don't offer. The free bus pass alone retails for over $1600.}",
