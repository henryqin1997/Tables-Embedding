    "textBeforeTable": "Track Listing British musician Michael Kiwanuka hits all the right spots \u2014 he offers acoustic shades in the vein of Nick Drake, a mournful croon reminiscent of Marvin Gaye, with the orchestrated soul of The Temptations \u2014 on his debut album, Home Again. At only 24, he sounds light years more mature than many of his pop contemporaries, offering solace in songs about moving on (the title track), struggling with faith (\u201cI\u2019m Getting Ready\u201d) and, what else, love, on the moving \u201cRest.\u201d Small touches, like the violins and gospel choirs of \u201cBones,\u201d or the horns and harps surging through \u201cI Won\u2019t Lie,\u201d lift these songs beyond their trappings, and Kiwanuka\u2019s nuanced delivery makes even his most plainspoken lyrics ring true. Given its lush detail and considerate yet heartfelt execution, Home Again feels like aural comfort food. Amoeba Review Buy $4.99 Media Condition: Like New / Sealed Price Format Condition 1 Used",
