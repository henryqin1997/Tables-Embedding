Both have regularly challenged the factory drivers, and their 2012 results were thoroughly deserved. I am confident that both drivers have more to prove and that we will see more impressive performances from them in 2013.\u201d, 3419=Talking at the launch of the Citroen Total Abu Dhabi World Rally Team launch last week, Loeb revealed that he felt Petter Solberg was the British M-Sport squad's hope for wins in 2013.

All of them, Mads, Evgeny and Thierry, proved their worth in 2012 and, with guidance from Nasser, they can all be fantastic ambassadors for Qatar, M-Sport and the WRC.\u201d, 6410=December 15, 2012, 3634=Sebastien Loeb, meanwhile, expects Citroen to continue its devastating run of World Rally Championship form next season -- and added that he doesn't expect the Qatar M-Sport team to win at all in 2013., 2895=The official Citroen team has been designated the Nos. 1, 2 and 3 for 2013, and and when Loeb drives No. 1 will be used; Hirvonen will keep No. 2 and Sordo No. 3., 4806=While Novikov has been an M-Sport driver since 2011, Neuville switches from the rival Citroen team, where he represented the make's Junior Team and Qatar-backed efforts in 2012.}",
