No. 08/523,665, filed Sep. 5, 1995 by Barrett et al., entitled \"Method And Apparatus for Determining an Instantaneous Phase Difference Between Two Signals.\", 54905=By letting B=1, the first multiplier 214 can also be eliminated. Using Jury's Test for Stability (see Kuo, B. C., \"Digital Control Systems\", Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc., New York, 1980, pp. 278-279), as is well-known by one of ordinary skill in the art, it can be shown that the discrete time digital phase locked loop 142 remains stable when changing the coefficient B to unity.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Thus, it should be apparent by now that the present invention provides a discrete time digital phase locked loop 142 that is cost effective, low in power consumption, and less affected by manufacturing variations. The present invention eliminates all external components which would ordinarily be used in a classical design of a digital phase locked loop. In particular, the third embodiment of the discrete time digital phase locked loop 142 eliminates two multipliers and a register included in the embodiment depicted in FIG. 3. This represents a significant reduction in integrated circuit die area, cost, and power consumption. Furthermore, because a large portion of this circuitry is digital, the system has a reduced dependence on voltage, temperature and process variations encountered in a wafer fabrication process. The elimination of one or more integration capacitors permits using the depicted embodiments of the discrete time digital phase locked loop 142 in a wafer fabrication process with poor capacitor structures, and eliminates the need for external filter capacitors, which can be required in some prior art implementations. Finally, the elements of the depicted embodiments of the discrete time digital phase locked loop 142 are independent of the reference frequency of the reference oscillator 135. This increases the flexibility of the phase locked loop according to the present invention over that of more traditional architectures. Analysis indicates that jitter sideband noise is below -60 dBc beyond 10 kHz as shown",
