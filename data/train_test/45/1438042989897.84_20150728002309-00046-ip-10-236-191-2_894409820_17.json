            "since the chalon campus is on top of a mountain, the college provides students especially residents shuttles take takes them to santa monica area, and also westwood area (near ucla).",
            "residents will automatically get a meal plan for the cafeteria and its amount will depend on the students' preference. for instance, some students have a weekly meal plan of $80, $85 and $90. students from both campuses can use their weekly meal plan either at the doheny or chalon cafeteria.",
            "at the chalon campus, there are 4 buildings: brady, carondelet, rossiter and yates & aldworth. rossiter and yates & aldworth are more quiet than the other. each semester, the ra's (resident assistants), put up programs for residents and many times they are fun activities to enjoy with friends and other residents.",
            "the classes can be pretty challenging but it's what makes mount st. mary's college a good college as it encourages students to become more independent, able to think critically and be responsible.",
            "it is good to explore the campus and since mount st. mary's college has two campus, one in brentwood and another in downtown la, msmc students are more than welcomed to explore both campuses. furthermore, shuttles are provided for all students to travel back and forth from doheny and chalon.",
            "here are the mount, students and faculties are friendly, approachable and helpful. the classes are smaller which is an advantage because the professors are approachable and will know you 1 on 1."

I think the grill and the sandwiches are the best--only because it is the least salty. The breakfast is quite amazing here (FYI)., 140642=Mount St. Mary's College is great for women who are interested in female empowerment. The students could be more active on campus, and that may change in Fall 2012 now that we have our new President. We are a liberal arts college, so expect to be well-rounded!, 310675=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Tips for prospective students Make sure you give your all once you start. Nursing program is extremely competitive. It is a small school so make sure you are out of the high school mind set and a serious college student. Learn to say no before you start, so you won't feel bad to saying no to go clubbing or a party. Also TIME MANAGEMENT. Bang for the buck Yes, even though it is expensive it is worth it. With your room and board you get an 80 dollar food allowance in the cafeteria. You get free tutoring, you can print papers, lecture notes, and personal items in the PC lab for free no charge. You have an online website called angel where you can see your lecture notes ,",
