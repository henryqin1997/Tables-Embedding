The TALF is a facility under which the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) extends loans with a term of up to five years to holders of eligible asset-backed securities. The TALF is intended to assist financial markets in accommodating the credit needs of consumers and businesses by facilitating the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by a variety of consumer and business loans. The loans provided through the TALF to eligible borrowers are non-recourse, meaning that the obligation of the borrower can be discharged by surrendering the collateral to the FRBNY. The loans are extended for the market value of the security less an amount known as a haircut. As a result, the borrower bears the initial risk of a decline in the value of the security., 335670=9.
