We are hoping that the server will be restored as early as Monday, August 21, but are providing these workarounds for use during the period of outage. </p><p> To update fink, you must either select an rsync mirror other than the primary one (see the next paragraph), or use the command fink selfupdate-cvs. You only need to give this command once; subsequent updates will continue to be performed using CVS. When the server is restored, you can revert to rsync updating by means of the command fink selfupdate-rsync. </p><p> To work around the lack of the binary distribution, and the \"master mirror\" of source files, run the command fink configure.
