    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{82683=Another suitable method of attaching the fastener 12 to the surface treating member 40 is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/551477 (Fritz et al.), filed on Apr. 18, 2000, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein. This patent application generally discloses a method of attaching a fastener to a surface treating member by first placing a layer of adhesive between the fastener and surface treating member. Then, the fastener and surface treating member are spin welded together with the layer of adhesive between them, so as to soften the layer of adhesive. Upon cooling, the layer of adhesive forms a bond between the fastener and the surface treating member 40. Preferably, the adhesive is a thermoplastic adhesive., 100715=The following parameters are preferred when spin welding a nylon fastener 12 on a coated abrasive web with a backing comprising a resin-impregnated cloth or polymer-backed cloth. The parameters found to affect the strength of the melt-bond between the fastener 12 and surface treating web 30 are as follows. The force that the chuck 76 applies to the system is preferably between about 250 and 1100 lb., more preferably between about 300 and 700 lb., and most preferably between about 350 and 500 lb. The speed of the motor 150 is preferably between about 500 and 8000 RPM, more preferably, between 2000 and 6000 RPM, and most preferably, between about 2500 and 4500 RPM. The spin time is preferably between about 0.05 seconds and 0.6 seconds. More preferably, the spin time is preferably between about 0.2 seconds and 0.45 seconds. The spin time is a measurement of how long the rotary motor 150 is maintained under power from the time the chuck 76 is positioned vertically within approximately 0.125 inches or less from the web 30 (essentially at the time of contact between the fastener 12 and the web 30) and ends with the command to remove power from the motor 150 after the fastener 12 contacts the surface treating web 30. After the power is removed from the rotary motor 150, the force between the fastener 12 on the web 30 must be maintained for a period of dwell time to form a sufficient bond between the fastener 12 and the web 30. Preferably, the dwell time is between 0.1 and 1 seconds, and more preferably, between 0.2 and 0.5 seconds., 59571=Applicant's copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/551477, filed on Apr. 18, 2000, teaches a method of attaching a fastener to an abrasive article via spin welding and employing an intermediate thermoplastic adhesive layer., 109883=Any commercially available machine vision system 82 capable of obtaining the conditions described herein may be used, such as the Acuity\u2122 VP-2000 available from RVSI Acuity, Inc. located in Nashua, N.H. Another suitable machine vision system 82 includes DVT Series 600 available from DVT, Inc. located in Norcross, Ga., 115337=A suitable laser system includes a laser generator coupled to required services, a beam delivery system, and a work surface containing or attached to an exhaust system. Preferably, the beam delivery system of laser 84 includes the following parameters: a galvanometer-based or other scanning optical-based system, minimum of 50 mm aperture, a focused beam size of less than 300\ufffd10\u22126 m in diameter, minimum field size of 15 inches, power capability of 2500 watts, speed of mirrors to direct the beam at a speed of between 300 and 2000 mm/sec (measured on the working surface) and acceleration greater than 200 g (measured on the working surface). Preferably, the beam delivery system is a completely reflective optical system, as opposed to a transmissive optical system. Preferably, the suitable laser system includes a total system accuracy of better than plus or minus 0.004 inches in any field position and for the lifetime of the equipment., 116319=Any commercially available lasers 84 capable of obtaining the conditions described herein may be used, such as the LPM-2500 and LPM-1000 available from LasX Industries, Inc. located in White Bear Lake, Minn.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The present invention has now been described with reference to several embodiments thereof. The foregoing detailed description and examples have been given for clarity of understanding only. No unnecessary limitations are to be understood therefrom. All patents and patent applications cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many changes can be made in the embodiments described without departing from the scope of the invention. Thus, the scope of the present invention should not be limited to the exact details and structures described herein, but rather by the structures described by the language of the claims, and the equivalents of those structures. Although it is preferable to use machine vision in combination with the laser to perform the inventive method, other combinations are within the invention, such as combining machine vision with the other suitable cutting means mentioned above or combining other sensing means with laser cutting. Although the cutting means illustrated for apparatus 50 is a laser, other cutting means may be used instead. For instance, suitable cutting means includes die cutting, water jet cutting, or ultrasonic cutting. As mentioned above, the fasteners 12 may be attached to the web 30 by methods other than spin welding. Preferably, the stations 52, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 88 of apparatus 50 are coordinated such that the web 30 stops and each station does its step simultaneously",
