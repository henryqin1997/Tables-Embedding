The 23 year old is out of contract at the end of this season and is available to talk to interested clubs about possible pre-contract moves from January 1st 2009 when the new transfer window opens. Shiels joined Hibernian, his only professional club to date in 2004 following a season with Arsenal youth. He has 7 caps for Northern Ireland and has scored 22 times for Hibs in 114 appearances. One interesting fact is that the footballer has been blind in one eye following an accident when aged only eight. Indeed in early 2006,he had an operation to remove his right eye after the player complained of discomfort and headaches. The disability though certainly doesn't appear to have affected his footballing prowess. Owen Coyle will of course be aware of Shiels from his time north of the border at his former club, St Johnstone., 10446=Trip To Ewood On TV (Thursday July 30 2015), 9664=Fleetwood Win Pleases Dyche (Wednesday July 29 2015), 10062=Agyei Signs On - Jones Extends Deal (Wednesday July 29 2015), 10640=Shrewsbury Reject Ginnelly Bid (Thursday July 30 2015), 11036=Nothing Duff About Michael's Testimonial (Monday August 3 2015), 9471=Nothing Short About Long Deal (Tuesday July 28 2015)}",
