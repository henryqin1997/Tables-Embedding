    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While certain exemplary preferred embodiments have been described and shown in the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that such embodiments are merely illustrative of and not restrictive on the broad invention. Further, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the specific construction and arrangements shown and described since various modifications or changes may occur to those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as claimed. It is intended that the scope of the invention be limited not by this detailed description but by the claims appended hereto. In one business model, verification services for issued time stamps are provided free of charge to any entity wanting to check the validity of a time stamp. Alternatively, verification services could be provided for a fee through the NOC. 6.3 Charges for Verification An alternative scheme is based upon billing clients for time certification of each TLC located on the clients' premises. In this case, a client pays for each issued TCCert and receives a flat rate on all of the time stamps issued during the valid TCCert period. In this case, the NOC coordinates and automates billing procedures. 6.2 Flat Rate Certification The disclosed system provides mechanisms for TLCs to transmit to the NOC the number of time stamps issued. The NOC can be adapted to log this information and create billing",
