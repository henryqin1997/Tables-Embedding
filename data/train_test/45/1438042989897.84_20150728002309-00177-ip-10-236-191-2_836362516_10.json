Al-Zahrani (2000) says that Kuwait University library has introduced CD-ROM and Internet facility in its libraries. Similarly, University of Bahrain libraries have implemented an electronic check-out system, and are using CD-ROM databases. Taran and Gorman (1999) conclude state that many Vietnamese libraries now have basic IT hardware and software, and the telecommunications infrastructure has improved to the point that most libraries have reliable telephone links. Gorny and Jazdon (1997) recognize that the best developed IT infrastructure is found in academic libraries, while the situation is worse in special libraries, because of a lack of financial funds., 28411=A majority of the libraries under study use Windows 98, while nearly half have implemented Windows 2000.
