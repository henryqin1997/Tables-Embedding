The kernel page claims the charging current is in ma, but that does not appear to be the case for all builds? eg 2.6.21.6-moko10. The battery temperature does not always appear to be in degrees C, either.}",

Some settings need to be changed. For details, have a look here. This is very much unimplemented at the moment.  Power management is of utmost concern to any mobile device. Battery power is quite limited, so we need to make sure we try our best to conserve it. (See also Power management requirements.) This page details the power management of the Phase 1 Neo1973.
