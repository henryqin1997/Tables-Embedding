Derek joined in Season 5, when he and actress Jennie Garth finished fifth. Derek and his Season 6 partner Shannon Elizabeth after their season together, when they were photographed walking and making out on a Malibu beach, which they surely never meant for anyone to see. They announced their split via Twitter prior to the start of Season 9. Derek's sister Julianne has also been a DWTS competitor and champion. They were partly raised and trained by Season 7 DWTS pro Corky Ballas and his wife, and grew up with Corky's son and DWTS pro Mark Ballas. Derek and Mark are in a band together now. Derek produced one of the many rehearsal-related injuries during Season 7, when he fell, hit his head and was taken to the hospital in a neck brace. It turned out he was OK.
