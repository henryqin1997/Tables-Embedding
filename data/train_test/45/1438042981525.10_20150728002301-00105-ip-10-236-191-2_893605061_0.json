But when they finally crossed over, boy did they do it in style, with their Brit Award, Ivor Novello and Mercury Prize-winning last offering The Seldom Seen Kid. Far too humble to let fickle fame change them, Garvey and the lads have returned with the epic Build A Rocket Boys, on which they look back at their childhoods with a wry smile and, as always, a lot of affection. True, they may no longer be the best kept secret in indie, but Manchester\u2019s prodigal sons have more than enough love to share with the expectant ears of the world.
