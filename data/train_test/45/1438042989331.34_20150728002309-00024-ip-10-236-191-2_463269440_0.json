They will kick off the season Thursday, Aug. 25\u00a0 at the SWAT Kick-Off Classic. \u00a0 The game has been moved up a day due to weather concerns associated with Hurricane Irene. It had previously been scheduled for Friday, Aug. 26. \u00a0 The event will be tobacco free and coaches and players from both teams will show their support by wearing shirts and hats with SWAT on them. Superintendent Reginald James and the Gadsden County School Board voted unanimously to approve a stronger tobacco policy in all Gadsden County schools in May. This event will be a promotion of that policy. The updated policy includes provisions prohibiting the use of tobacco by faculty, students, staff, visitors, and contractors in schools, educational facilities, and school-owned vehicles. \u00a0 Parents are encouraged to bring their children to the event and enjoy the tobacco-free atmosphere. \u00a0 The event will take place at Corry Field in Quincy. Kickoff is at 7:30 p.m. All gate and concession proceeds will go to benefit the teams. The event is sponsored by the Gadsden County Tobacco Free Partnership and Gadsden County Students Working Against Tobacco. \u00a0For more information on the Gadsden County Tobacco Free Partnership please contact Luke Ihnen, Program Manager with the American Lung Association at (850) 386-2065 x 1146 or lihnen@lungfla.org. \u00a0}",
