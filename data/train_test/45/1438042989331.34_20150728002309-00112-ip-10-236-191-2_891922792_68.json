            "There is always stuff going on on campus like movies, group exercise classes, recreational games on upper campus, etc. And if you aren't into doing things on campus and you're a bit of a party animal, Water Street is just across the bridge and I know that's a hot spot (I know because I live right next to it).",
            "Once again, I never actually lived on campus so I am not sure what the dining halls were like. However I have eaten at Davies (the main student building) and it actually has some pretty good food there. A wide variety for entrees and many options for little snacks or grab and go lunches.",
            "I never stayed in the dorms, but from what I hear it can be hit or miss. For example, if you live on upper campus you have to contend with walking up and down The Hill everyday. The dorms themselves, from what I've seen, are pretty typical. No more or less dormy than at other schools.",
            "I transferred to UWEC straight into the nursing program so all of my classes have been quite rigorous, so I can't say for certain how rigorous classes in other departments are. However, there will always be those easier classes and then the harder ones so I suppose it all depends on the class.",
            "Obviously the biggest tip is to visit the school. That's the best way to figure out if you'll like it. If you have the slightest inkling that you might like it, visit again. Sometimes visiting twice can help decide whether or not a school is the right fit for you.",
            "UWEC is, in all honesty, a wonderful school. In my opinion it is the perfect size, not too big and not too small. Additionally, the professors I've had and the fellow students I meet are really great."

(largest dorm, very easy to meet people, the hub of on-campus living) - Visit the campus when classes are in session... it makes a huge difference! - You WILL make friends and you WILL have the time of your life! Don't be afraid to put yourself out there and try something new... chances are you'll be glad you did. Bang for the buck College is never cheap, but costs are very reasonable (compare to UW-Madison) for the quality of education and the college",
