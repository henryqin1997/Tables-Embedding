            "Barely any campus crime. I believe that is due to our own campus police that patrol 24/7. Dorms are safe as I said before and the whole campus is well lit with emergency stations every 100 feet or so.",
            "Not a greek myself, but there are several on campus. Very involved and good times.",
            "There is a lot to do if you want to take the time and do it.",
            "Education, AgScience, AgBusiness, Geology, Geography, GIS/GPS, and just started a new program and is top of the art in Disaster Relief and Response",
            "There is an old church about 10 miles outside of town that has some lore about it and is said to be haunted. Weird tales surround it, and it seems like at some point every student makes their way out to it to check it out.",
            "Cheap tuition and great education. This college also has one of the highest job placements for graduates in their career field at 95%,",
            "There are intramural sports,disc golf, usually activities at the union weekly, many speakers come to campus, usually have a spring and fall concert, and have some comedians come to campus as well throughout the year, there are a ton of activities throughout the year to keep you busy so if you're bored it's your own fault. The town has few fun things to do. There are community sports for every season, a large swimming pool, 2 golf courses (Mozingo and Country Club), the Hangar (movie theater), several bars to go out to (The Palms is my favorite), Bearcat Lanes (bowling alley), Mozingo Lake has camping, swimming, boating, and many more outdoor activities.",
            "The campus has a new dining hall in the Student Union, containing Papa Johns, Chik-fil-a, Einstein Bros. Bagels, and many other restaurants to satisfy anyone's palate. There are many flavors to choose from including japanese style cuisine, tex mex, italian, and homestyle cooking. There are stores in the food area of the Union (milk and produce), community building of the Apartments (anything for apartment dwellers), and a grocery store in the station. The town itself has many options from fast food to sitdown meals and one of the best mexican restaurants I have ever eaten at, La Bonita.",
            "NWMSU has revamped dorms. There are Suites and Apartments for upperclassmen. They are very secure with a person working the front desk at all times and having electronic entry by fob only. There are many activities put on by hall directors and RA's. The entire floor will become like a family to you. And many of your friends will stem from who you meet while living in the dorms.",
            "The college has one of the best Education programs in the nation and has an elementary on campus so that students will get hands on education from the start of their degree. NWMSU has a great Ag and Ag Science department and is a leading program at NW. NWMSU is growing every semester and more and more majors are starting, too. The classes are challenging, but it's college and should be. The best thing is that the class sizes allow for a lot of interaction with the professor so if you are having trouble, help is readily available. There is a great tutor program in the library and the Talent Development Center is open and has tutors from open to close.",
            "Always be prepared for the ever changing weather. Maryville sits on the line of 2 temperate zones and receives a definite 4 seasons. It can be 70 degrees one day and snowing the next. It gets hot during the summer and usually has a relatively high humidity. Use SafeRide, a campus shuttle program, that will take you to random places in town. It will save you on gas and you can use it to go out on the town for the night. It is always better to have a sober ride than to be sorry. The college and town prides itself upon the NWMSU Bearcats. The football team has won 3 National Championships in the past 15 years, so try and make it out to cheer on this great football team. The women's and men's basketball teams are pretty good as well. The sports program overall is a good one and a staple of this college town.",
            "NWMSU is a great university with a family atmosphere. The campus is between 6,000 to 7,000 students so it is small enough to become familiar with people, but large enough to always meet new people and make new friends. The town itself is a very proud and welcoming town that has activities for students and alumni alike."

Northwest is a great school but the town Maryville can get very cold and have very strong winds. Please dress accordingly., 258487=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 183739=The campus is switching to a new dining plan in the 2013 Fall semester. According to the new plan there will be many great places to eat. There is also a small store that you can buy snack food and other supplies (trash bags, cleaning supplies) and is open 24hours. You can also use your meal card on the vending machines all over campus for a quick snack., 59250=The bang for your buck is probably one of the best you can get in Missouri and around northern Missouri. If you did A+ in the Missouri Schools then you get an easy 1500 bucks a year for 3 years, and all you need to keep is a 3.0 GPA. Even though it's a cheaper college the level of education that comes with it is awesome, its definitely a bang for your buck starting at around 14,000 a year., 180618=Lots of options for places to live. May live in a new suite style dorm, the older dorms, apartments, frat houses, etc. Many options off campus also., 133724=The Hangars ( movies), Outback, Molly's, the Lake. There are also event such as speakers, comedy shows, and other performers that come to the school. The events are usually free. This past October 4 comedians performed at our school for free and the last guest was Steve'O from Jackass. There is always something to do on campus for free.}",
