Rather, the appended claims should be construed broadly, to include other variants and embodiments of the invention which may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and range of equivalents of the invention. Although the process 100 described above references a content server 13 which performs both content serving and tracking functions, it is within the scope of the present invention to have separate servers for performing the content serving and tracking functions, respectively. Additionally, it should be noted that the different servers described above (e.g., e-mail server 12, content server 13, reporting server 14, and database server) may be operated by different entities, and it is not required that the servers all be operated by one entity. FIG. 16 shows a session manager activation step 440. The session manager is a separate program module (engine) within the reporting server 14 which monitors the overall system for user activity and connection. A \u201csession\u201d comprises each time a user computer accesses the content from the content server 13. The session ends when the users closes the e-mail and/or browser program, or after a specified time (controlled by the session timer, explained below). The session manager is started at step 441, when the session manager engine receives a notification from the e-mail server 12 that",
