It has the same user names and groups as the main test bed and it also lacks proper DNS configuration. Its details are:  However, the Red Hat Active Directory test bed does not yet have DNS configured appropriately. See below for how to do that.

Unfortunately, it is not clear whether this can be made available to the public at this time. In addition this works poorly for testing if you're on a VPN. Because the VPN connection must be up before the Active Directory domain is accessible.

Setup a Local Caching Server Setting up a Local DNS Caching Server allows you to forward certain domains to the Active Directory DNS server directly, without bugging you admins, local router, (or ISP, ha) to do so. Install bind like so:  # yum install caching-nameserver Don't add a forwarders line. And add this to the end of /etc/named.conf. In the example below 'ad.example.com' is the Active Directory domain, and 'A.B.C.D' are the octets of the IPv4 address that the Active Directory controller is listening on. Note that in the second line, you use the first three octets of this IPv4 address in reverse.  zone \"ad.example.com\" { type stub; masters { A.B.C.D; }; }; zone \"C.B.A.in-addr.arpa\" { type stub; masters { A.B.C.D; }; }; For the above Red Hat Active Directory Test Bed, the snippet to add is as follows. You can also use this as a guide for how to munge the IPv4 address on the second line.  zone \"radi08.segad.lab.sjc.redhat.com\" { type stub; masters { 10.14.5.60; }; }; zone \"5.14.10.in-addr.arpa\" { type stub; masters { 10.14.5.60; }; }; zone \"redhat.com\" { type stub; masters {10.38.5.11; 10.38.5.12; }; }; Restart the named service with:  # systemctl restart named.service Before configuring",
