    "textAfterTable": "Blockbuster doesn\u2019t charge extra for Blu-Ray and Blockbuster also offers the very convenient in-store exchange service, but Netflix offers the buffet style all-you-can-watch download service. Personally, I disabled the Blu-Ray option on my Netflix account immediately after getting the notification, but the rates aren\u2019t too out of line with what Blockbuster is doing. I\u2019m glad that there are at least two competent services to choose between.
