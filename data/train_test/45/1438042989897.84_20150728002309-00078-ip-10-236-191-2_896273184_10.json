            "The campus safety at Grove City is good, though the students are usually mocking them or pocking fun at them, but I think that's true of every college and their campus safety groups.",
            "Greek life is vibrant, with many sororities and fraternities. This is a great way to form bonds and friendships that extend far beyond the college years and into your whole lifetime.",
            "There are a plethora of clubs and activities to join. Because Grove City is a Christian college, there are many ministries on campus that serve the surrounding area.",
            "If you are hard-working, diligent, Christian, devoted, and love learning then Grove City is the right college for you.",
            "When a guy gets engaged, all of his friends surprise him, tackle him, and carry him to Wolf Creek which runs through lower campus and through him into the river. This is called Creeking, and it's pretty fun. The cries of Wolf Creek! Wolf Creek! are often heard in the fall and spring, and that's the cue that someone is being creeked.",
            "Grove City is extremely low in cost. This is outstanding because the low cost isn't a compromise for high academics; both high academic standards and a low tuition are here at Grove City.",
            "This is probably Grove City's biggest struggle; since it's located in a small town, there's no city life and during the weekends there often isn't much to do. But with friends you get creative and always manage to figure something out.",
            "The food is pretty good, though not the best. But there's always a couple of things that are good options in the cafeteria.",
            "Dorm life can be good if you join Greek life, otherwise it can be fairly isolating. As with any college, if you find a group of friends that you love, you'll make it through college just fine.",
            "Since Grove City is located in a small town, there isn't much city life or activities during the weekends, which means that academics are the top priority for Grove City students. Academically, Grove City is excellent, at the top of its class.",
            "Get ready to read and to learn. It's tough, but it's worth it. If you're not serious about academics and if you don't enjoy learning, I wouldn't go to Grove City.",
            "Grove City is serious about academics, so be ready to be challenged in that respect. Grove City also is fairly diverse; like any college campus it has its fair share of wild people who are in college just to have a good time. At Grove City, you will be challenged and you will grow over all four years; I've learned so much and I'm glad I chose Grove City."

It will be a lot of work, but it will also be the most amazing learning experience of your life. Also, be prepared to be challenged and uplifted in your faith by both students and faculty. Finally, if you love sports, this is the place for you. On average a student participates in 2.3 Intramural sports...not including club and varsity., 82695=Hard, Hard, HARD! The classes cannot be compared to other school's classes. The tests are killer. The professors know their stuff and they aren't afraid to test you on what they taught. Grove City College - where your best hasn't been good enough since 1876., 13823=From Grove City's website: U.S. News & World Report has again ranked Grove City College the No. 1 Best Value in its category for the 2007 guide. This year marks the fifth year in a row that Grove City has been named in the top spot. As a student at GCC, I will say that there is a reason for this. I am learning a ton here, I am confident that I am getting a phenomenal education, and tuition (plus room & board) is less than $10,000 a semester. Compared to what you'd pay at another private school for a comparable education, that price is an absolute steal., 70033=Grove City College: Where your best has not been good enough since 1873.

Also, someone who is strong in their relationship with Christ or would like to be stronger - yes, it is a Christian school, and I think anyone who isn't Christian would probably feel a little out of place. You don't have to have all the answers, though...people here are in all different stages of their faith. Tips for prospective students Make sure that you come and visit the campus - most people live really close, so that's not hard, but as",
