Each transistor 831 and 832 includes an ultra-thin body 830 formed with strained semiconductor film 818. In various embodiments, the film 818 is ultra thin (under 1000 \u212b). In various embodiments, the film 818 is approximately 1000 \u212b or less. In various embodiments, the channel length of the transistor is less than or equal to about 1000 \u212b, and the thickness of the film is less than or equal to about 300 \u212b. The strain enhances mobility in the channel, thus overcoming problems associated with heavy channel doping.}",

For further mobility enhancement, it is desirable to strain a thin semiconductor wafer, such as an ultra-thin silicon wafer with a thickness within a range of approximately 300 \u212b to 1000 \u212b, with a strain within a range of approximately 0.75% to approximately 1.5% where the mobility enhancement levels off. It is also desirable to reduce unnecessary strain and provide a margin for error without unduly affecting the mobility enhancement. Thus, it is desirable to strain a thin semiconductor layer, such as a thin silicon layer, with a strain in the range of approximately 1% to approximately 1.2%., 117440=The illustration of the system 1200 is intended to provide a general understanding of one application for the structure and circuitry of the present subject matter, and is not intended to serve as a complete description of all the elements and features of an electronic system using strained semiconductor films according to the present subject matter. As one of ordinary skill in the art will understand, such an electronic system can be fabricated in single-package processing units, or even on a single semiconductor chip, in order to reduce the communication time between the processor and the memory device., 99083=The thickness of the surface layer 518 bonded to the substrate 511 is defined by the depth of ion implantation 516 during the bond cut process. In various embodiments, the thickness of the surface layer 518 is such that it does not yield or otherwise plastically deform under the desired mechanical strain induced by the bond. In various embodiments, the thickness of the surface layer 518 is less than 200 nm, such that it can be termed an ultra thin wafer. In various embodiments, the silicon layer has a thickness of about 0.1 microns (100 nm or 1000 \u212b). In various embodiments, the silicon layer has a thickness less than 0.1 microns. In various embodiments, the silicon layer has a thickness in a range of approximately 300 \u212b to 1000 \u212b., 118627=Disclosed herein is a technique to provide strained semiconductor layers by bonding, or wafer bonding, a crystalline semiconductor membrane to a substrate with recesses. Strained semiconductor membranes, including uniaxially strained films, are fabricated using common and economical semiconductor processing techniques. In various embodiments, a number of recesses that have a predetermined shape and dimension are formed at a predetermined position in a silicon substrate using a LOCOS process. In various embodiments, a semiconductor membrane is formed and bonded to the substrate using a bond-cut process. The membrane is bonded to the raised portions of the silicon substrate in an environment having a first pressure, and then is into the recesses of the silicon substrate in an environment having a second pressure. The second pressure is greater than the first pressure, and is sufficiently large to influence the membrane into the recesses. In various embodiments, the first pressure is a vacuum, and the second pressure is atmospheric pressure. In various embodiments, the membrane has a thickness within a range of approximately 300 \u212b to 1000 \u212b and has a strain greater than 0.5% such that the strained membrane is characterized by enhanced carrier mobility. In various embodiments, the membrane is bonded to the raised portions of the silicon substrate in an environment having a lower pressure and a temperature within a range of approximately 300\ufffd C. and 400\ufffd C., and then is bonded into the recesses of the silicon substrate in an environment having a higher pressure and a temperature within a range of approximately 800\ufffd C. and 1000\ufffd C., 66797=This application is related to the following commonly assigned U.S. patent applications which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety: \u201cOutput Prediction Logic Circuits With Ultra-Thin Vertical Transistors and Methods of Formation,\u201d U.S. application Ser.
