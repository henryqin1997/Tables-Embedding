FIG. 11 depicts a scatter plot of predicted blood glucose concentrations from 103 samples using data derived from 2030 nm to 2398 nm generated from a partial least squares model optimized with twelve factors attaining a standard error of validation of 64.10 mg/dL versus actual blood glucose concentrations. With samples 23, 67, and 83 removed, FIG. 12 depicts a scatter plot of predicted blood glucose concentrations from 100 samples using data derived from 2030 nm to 2398 nm, generated from a partial least squares model optimized with eight factors attaining a standard error of validation of 27.43 mg/dL versus actual blood glucose concentrations. With gross outliers eliminated, the partial least squares technique utilized in the method of the present invention was able to make better predictions and use a less complex model, that is, a model using fewer factors. The sample depicted in FIG. 11 having a predicted value of approximately 750 mg/dL corresponded to sample indicated by reference numeral 83. If sample 83 in FIG. 11 is ignored and the remaining samples in FIG. 11 are compared with those in FIG. 12, it is apparent that there is a wider spread of data about the identity line in FIG. 11. These results illustrate the influence of a relatively small number of outliers in seriously degrading the overall performance of a calibration model., 83532=FIG. 12 is a scatter plot of predicted blood glucose concentrations from 100 samples using data derived from 2030 nm to 2398 nm, generated from a partial least squares model optimized with eight factors attaining a standard error of validation of 27.43 mg/dL versus actual blood glucose concentrations., 84218=FIG. 15 is a scatter plot of predicted blood glucose concentrations from 95 samples using data derived from 2030 nm to 2398 nm, generated from a partial least squares model optimized with eight factors attaining a standard error of validation of 26.97 mg/dL versus actual blood glucose concentrations., 112942=FIG. 16 sets forth a summary of 95 samples representing both major spectral regions examined using the method and apparatus of he present invention, and shows that blood glucose concentration predictions using the 95 and 100 sample data sets and the same spectral regions yielded very similar results. A slight reduction in prediction error to SEV of 26.97 mg/dL with respect to the 100 sample set depicted in FIG. 12 resulted for the 95 sample set depicted in FIG. 15 for the 2030 nm to 2398 nm region, with the difference representing approximately a 1% reduction in error. An F-test at the 95% confidence level did not find this a significant difference. Comparison of the partial least squares results from other spectral regions with various forms of data preprocessing yielded similar findings., 112051=Two spectral regions of the 100 samples were tested separately for outliers, with Mahalanobis distances for each of the regions shown in FIGS. 13 and 14. Nine samples were flagged as possible outliers in the 1580 nm to 1848 nm region, and six samples were flagged in the 2030 nm to 2398 nm region as possible outliers. As is apparent from comparison of FIGS. 13 and 14, the flagged samples were different in the two spectral regions. Outliers may be selected to be those flagged samples that are excluded from class membership in either or both spectral ranges, at a confidence level selected to be in the range of 3-5\u03c3. Four of the samples rejected were also identified as possible outliers from the principal component score plots, FIGS. 7-9. Identification of the fifth sample required examination in the higher dimensional space associated with Mahalanobis distances., 84539=FIG. 16 is a table representing a summary of outlier detection results for 111 blood glucose samples over the spectral ranges 1580 nm to 1848 nm and 2030 nm to 2398 nm utilizing the present invention, and indicating possible causes of sample error., 82837=FIG. 9 is a scatter plot of principal component 3 versus principal component 2 of near-infrared spectra from 111 blood glucose samples in the range of 2030 nm to 2398 nm.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The present invention having been described in its preferred embodiments, it is clear that it is susceptible to numerous modifications and embodiments within the ability of those skilled in the art and without the exercise of the inventive faculty. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the method and apparatus of the present invention encompasses alternative biological fluid analyte measurement techniques, including biological fluid analyte concentrations derived using light reflectance, light transmission, and other techniques used in conjunction with invasive, non-invasive, and in-vivo biological fluid analyte measurement techniques. In addition, measurements of biological fluid analytes may also include triglycerides, cholesterol, and serum proteins, with outlier detection using the method and apparatus of the present invention. Sensitivity of outlier detection to triglyceride or any other analyte which affects spectral response may be advantageous, however. Spectral data may be partitioned such that samples with high triglycerides form a first calibration set while samples with low triglycerides form a second calibration set, so that new samples may be tested with the method and apparatus of the present invention to determine whether the first or second calibration set is representative of the new sample, thus allowing the selection of a prediction model determined from \"similar\" calibration spectra. If a Mahalanobis distance threshold of 3.0 is used to determine outliers, a set of 89 samples results. Utilizing a partial least squares technique, leave-one-out validation on the set of",
