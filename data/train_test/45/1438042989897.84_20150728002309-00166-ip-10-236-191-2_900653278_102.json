            "There is little security but I don't think it is really need since it's such a nice place to be.",
            "There are a handful of groups I would recommend searching as soon as possible for what you would be interested in because they are very easy to get into so spots are limited.",
            "Everyone is welcome here and everyone should come, this school is not that noticed around the states and it really should be because it is amazing.",
            "Nothing unusual but studying before finals SHOULD be a tradition in everyone's book.",
            "Financing was SO simple soon after my acceptance on my financial aid tab I had rewards and scholarships overflowing and it was a beautiful sight to see. The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is more affordable then you would imagine.",
            "A lot! Clubs, Restaurants, Sporting Events, Parties, A huge library for you readers! :)",
            "There are a lot of places for food you can go for both on campus and off. I LOVE especially that Chipotle is literally right across the street from main campus.",
            "The usual, there are big rooms and little rooms, If you want a great place to live be sure to sign up ASAP the good ones will go if you wait too long! The super doubles are amazing and even if you don't have a roommate they will pair you up based on common interests.",
            "The classes are both simple and challenge in that you really have to think and study but you never have to break your schedule for any homework.",
            "To anyone coming to Lincoln, be prepared for a fun educational experience, and there isn't any need to be nervous because no matter who you are there are people here for you.",
            "To keep it short and sweet this school is amazing. I have never stepped onto a university so open and friendly, it's nice to be at such an inviting location. This school in my book deserves a 10 out of 10 and it should be noticed more worldwide for it's excellence."

I suggest applying before april or as soon as it opens up to assure that you will receive ample support! Good luck!, 154568=UNL gives GREAT scholarships. This is ultimately why I chose to go to UNL for my freshman year. As an out of state student, the price UNL offered me was within $1000 of what an in state school offered me. They also don't have many hidden fees. You get unlimited meals (which are EXCELLENT! The #1 thing I miss about UNL), free internet (don't take this for granted!), along with many other free services., 258518=The campus police are very active on campus and I never felt unsafe. They are very diligent with their work and have great standards to maintaining the safety and justice of the college. My friend lost his glasses sometime in March and they are still updating him well into the summer, so they are very persistant., 596816=The food here is pretty good and is probably what you would typically expect in a dining hall. The staff is usually friendly and the dining halls themselves are really clean. The variety of food is usually not really great, and healthy options are limited. The only really disappointing part of having a meal plan is that on the weekends, you only get two meals (Brunch and Dinner) and brunch doesn't start until 10:30. Also, the variety of food on the weekends is substantially less than what is available on the weekdays., 80068=I am a past student, then I transferred to Southeast Community College, and am returning to UNL in the Fall of 2011. The University of Nebraska Lincoln has really good professors for the most part, but it's best to ask around about which professors to take. I had one that I feel like I didn't learn anything from, but the rest have been really knowledgeable and passionate about their fields which always helps retain interest and increase learning.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here I lived on campus in Sandoz residence hall for my first year. The dining halls around campus are great--with a meal plan, you have access to all of them. They just remodeled Sandoz after I moved out, and all of the other residence halls are pretty up-to-date. Lincoln is a great town. It's somewhere between a town and a city. It's bigger than most places in Nebraska, but it's college-centered, not business centered like Omaha. UNL has two campuses--downtown, and East campus. The downtown campus is the main campus--East campus is mostly for agricultural studies and overflow of classes. Downtown Lincoln is perfect for college students. There are a few clubs with live music. Lots of delicious, affordable restaurants (Chipotle, Noodles & Co.) as well as regular fast-food and more pricey options. There are movie theaters, great options for used clothing stores, and plenty of green spaces for Frisbee and other stereotypical college activities. Am learning a lot There are a wide variety of classes offered. I'm an English major, and UNL has a great English program. It's home to the Prairie Schooner, which is a highly regarded literary magazine. There are a lot of great poets here and even in my freshman year I learned a lot. There are also a lot of opportunities for customizing your education. You",
