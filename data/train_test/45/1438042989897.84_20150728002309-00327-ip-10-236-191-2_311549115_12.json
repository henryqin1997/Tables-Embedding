Looking at what we know today, if you pick against the Tigers, Nationals, Cardinals, or Dodgers, you're making a conscious choice to pick the second (or third) best team in the division. I doubt the guys who selected the Indians, Braves, or Giants would really wager $1000 straight up against the favorite -- and if they would they should hop a flight to Vegas. Yet despite the obvious CHOICE for 1st place, no one thinks those teams are 100% or even 90% to win the division. But they're all well over 50% and thus near unanimous choices., 328427=Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 Baseball Prospectus, LLC. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Surprise Me!, 7324=March 21, 2014}",

Today we reveal the Baseball Prospectus staff predictions for the division standings and the major player awards (MVP, Cy Young, and Rookie of the Year) in the American and National Leagues. Each staff member's division standings predictions may be found later in the article. Here, we present a wisdom-of-the-crowds summary of the results. In each table you'll find the average rank of each team in their division with first-place votes in parentheses, plus the results of our pre-season MVP, Cy Young, and Rookie of the Year voting. by Baseball Prospectus Staff Picks for 2014 Pre-Season Predictions March 21, 2014 }; \"data_track_clickback\":true var addthis_config = {",
