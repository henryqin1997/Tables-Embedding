No. 09/612,866, filed concurrently herewith on Jul. 10, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,400,287 for DATA STRUCTURE FOR CREATING, SCOPING, AND CONVERTING TO UNICODE DATA FROM SINGLE BYTE CHARACTER SETS, DOUBLE BYTE CHARACTER SETS, OR MIXED CHARACTER SETS COMPRISING BOTH SINGLE BYTE AND DOUBLE BYTE CHARACTER SETS, currently co-pending, and assigned to the same assignee as the present invention., 106077=To adapt the CCSID of a mapping table to a format usable by internal or operating system services to locate the required mapping table, the assembler can employ a variety of methods. One such technique uses the observation that each CCSID is sixteen bits long, and that its hexadecimal representation therefore contains exactly four hexadecimal digits. For example, CCSID number 01148 is equivalent to the hexadecimal value X\u2018047C\u2019. If those four hexadecimal digits are converted to character form, they can be attached to a standard prefix and used as a module name. For example, in the IBM High Level Assembler, such a module name could be created from a prefix \u2018ASMA\u2019 and a suffix given by the four hexadecimal digits, in this case \u2018ASMA047C\u2019. This constructed name can then be used as the name of the mapping table in all service requests involving finding and loading the mapping table., 29713=Application Ser.
