If a NO result occurs, error treatment is provided by protocol screening module 411 in step 518., 33962=Referring first to FIG. 1, there is shown a block diagram illustrating the conventional interconnection among various network elements in a single communication network. FIG. 1 thus illustrates the current state of the industry agreement on interfaces and reflects the ITU-T Recommendations Q.1214 and Q.1211., 46881=There are several options that can be taken with respect to a software implementation of the present invention. In the most straightforward embodiment, SCF adapter 421 and SSF adapter 422 can be implemented as asynchronous processes, such as those that can be created within the UNIX\ufffd operating system. Protocol coordination function (PCF) module 402 can be implemented as a library of objects that contain (a) coordination objects (i.e., semaphores or monitors), as well as (b) the set of objects that perform the protocol message conversion from a canonic form to a specific form (such as CS-1, ETSI Core INAP, etc.) and vice versa. The behavior of the latter objects will then be governed by the state machines defined in ITU-T Recommendation Q.1218., 41508=The MAP 304 of FIG. 3 provides an emulation function at the interfaces between SCF 302 and SSF/CCF 306, that is dependent upon the direction in which signaling messages are passed between these elements. First, MAP 304 operates at the SCF to SSF interface as though it is an SSF/CCF, thus using any existing INAP option (such as the SSF Application Service Element (ASE), as described in ITU-T Recommendation Q.1218, or Bellcore AIN 0.1 option, or ETSI Core INAP option) supported by the SCF. Second, MAP 304 operates at the SSF/CCF to SCF interface as though it is an SCF, thus using any existing INAP option (SCF Application Service Element (ASE), as described in ITU-T Recommendation Q.1218, or Bellcore AIN 0.1 option, or ETSI Core INAP option) supported by the SSF/CCF, independent of the option used by the other side. For example, the SSF/CCF may use the AIN 0.1 INAP, while the SCP may use ETSI CORE, 36802=As shown in FIG. 2, the only inter-networking interfaces between elements in Networks A and B are (a) the interface 250 between SCF 208 and SDF 244, and (b) the interface 251 between SCF 230 and SDF 220. These interfaces use the INAP protocol, as set forth in ITU-T Recommendations Q.1211 and Q.1218. These interfaces are limited to the extension of database queries from the SCF to the connected SDF, and to the transmission of query responses from the SDF back to the SCF. These interfaces specifically exclude any exchange of service-related information, since all such information is, by definition, contained in the SCF.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Various modifications and adaptations of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For that reason, it is intended that the invention be limited only in accordance with the following claims. If a YES result occurs in step 605, the process proceeds to step 607, in which the message is translated and sent to the SS7 adapter 414. Next, in step 608, a determination is made as to whether a translation into a foreign SS7 format needed. If a YES result occurs, the message is translated into the foreign format in step 609, and the process proceeds to step 610, in which the message is sent to the SCF, in this example, SCF 302 of FIG. 3. If a NO result occurs in step 608, the process skips step 609 and proceeds directly from step 608 to step 610, as translation is not required. If a YES result occurs in step 601, the process proceeds to step 603, in which the appropriate module (i.e., module 430, 432 or 434) in protocol identification module 426 is selected. Then, in step 604, the message is passed to the protocol coordination function module 402. Next, a determination is made in step 605 as to whether further information from the switch is required for the translation. If a NO result occurs, then, in step 606, a message is sent back to SSF/CCF 306, and the state",
