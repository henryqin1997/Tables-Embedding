            "Being in Philadelphia, there is a lot to do for fun. There are many kinds of restaurants on campus as well as in Center City. You can also check out the historic sites in downtown Philadelphia. A common activity for Penn students is going to Center City for the day.",
            "This is where Penn could use work. Many students, after their freshman year, drop the formerly required dining plan and depend on cooking and restaurants instead. I would recommend Penn focus on their food rather than the dining halls itself,",
            "The best place for freshmen to live is the Quad or Hill due to the nice social atmosphere there. One nice thing about dorms is that there are three on-campus high rises where a lot of non-freshman live. Dorm life overall is pretty good.",
            "Academics are a strong part of Penn. Penn is strong in business, the sciences, engineering, and the humanities. What makes Penn special is the opportunities to explore interdisciplinary fields.",
            "I would advise students to take advantage of opportunities presented to them. Also, it is important to maintain a good balance between studies and extracurricular activities. Finally, make sure to talk to advisors and professors as they have a lot to offer."

I admit I did not have the best score for applying to this school (1900 and 30 ACT) it didn't stop me from applying. Keep your hopes up, be active in your home, school and community and it will give you that fighting chance., 285296=There are three dining areas at each end and the middle of campus. 1920 Commons was hit or miss but Hill was pretty good., 150203=Awesome social experience, whether or not you're on a hall with people that become your best friends. I was on a particularly quiet hall. Though I was disappointed at first, I soon came to appreciate the peacefulness of my living environment. Every time I wanted to get rowdy, I'd walk down the hall or across the quad to my friends' halls. My room was the size of a closet and we had co-ed, less than desirable bathrooms, but the experience of living with over 1000 other freshman in a 1800s castle was well worth it. Being able to walk outside and sit on the grass on a sunny day to listen to music or do your homework while your best friends surround you playing frisbee or walking to class is an unmatchable freedom., 317513=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 120003=Meal plans for those who don't have the patience to cook for themselves, and an excellent selection of restaurants which cater to the college crowd. There are even a few places which are open until 4:30 AM!}",

You need to like living in a city and being around a diverse group of people. Penn really loves students who are passionate so show that on your application and in whatever you get involved in at Penn. Tips for prospective students Penn and college in general is an adjustment. I had to get used to pacing out my coursework and figuring out how to study for classes where a midterm and a final are your grades! (Yeah it is scary). My tips would be to not over schedule yourself your first semester. You are going to want to get involved in a lot on campus and in your dorm, so try and take a lighter load. Also don't be afraid to talk to your professors. They are great about offering extra help and resources or just chatting about their research. Use the office hours they provide. Lastly, make sure to remember that college",
