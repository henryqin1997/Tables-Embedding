For downloads see Download, for installation instructions see Flashing the Neo FreeRunner., 16221=SHR is a community driven distribution. It contains some basic GTK+ based applications which make use of the FSO. There currently is a EFL (with elementary) dialer, messages and contacts application programmed in C. As of November 9th, 2008, there is no stable release of this distribution yet, as the SHR team doesn't feel it to be good enough. You can find images though on the SHR buildhost.}",

Some have modules compiled in, others have modules compiled separately. If compiled separately, modules can be distributed in the same package file as the kernel or separately. The bootloader. Theoretically, any version of uboot could be used with any distribution. In the future Qi will replace uboot. The bootsplash screen image. This is purely decorative.
