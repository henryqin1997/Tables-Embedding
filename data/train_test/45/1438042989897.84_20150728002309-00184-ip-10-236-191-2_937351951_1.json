For oohs, aahs and eeks, Blackgang Chine has loads of exciting and eccentric rides and exhibits crammed into 40 acres of Victorian gardens, and there\u2019s a toboggan run, 3D maze and more rollercoasters at its sister theme park, Robins Hill. If the sun is shining, the obvious choice is Sandown beach, for sandpies and swimming, followed by dodgems on the pier, or a visit to the animated dinosaurs at Dinosaur Isle. It\u2019s also worth taking a boat trip to see the iconic chalk stacks and lighthouse at the Needles, or going loco on the Havenstreet Steam Railway.\u2028\u2028 Historical types should also check out Osbourne House, the seaside palace where Queen Vicky, Bertie and brood used to come to top up their tans, or take a tour of the mosaics and Roman jewellery on display at Brading Roman Villa. Budding zoologists are spoiled for choice: as well as the Owl and Monkey Haven, there are tigers and big cats at the Isle of Wight Zoo, alpacas, penguins and meerkats at the Seaview Wildlife Encounter, and over 200 species on view at the Amazon World Zoo Park.
