    "textBeforeTable": "\u00bb \u00a0 August \u00ab \u00a0 more \u00bb Five years after the death of her beloved husband Garrett (Ed Harris), Nikki (Annette Bening) meets a man who seems his exact duplicate. Not only does the stranger possess the same deeply lined face and startling blue eyes, he also shares Garrett\u2019s kindness, humor, and passion for art. Romance blossoms, but Nikki can\u2019t bring herself to tell him the truth about what drew her to him, even as she can\u2019t resist taking him to all the old haunts. It isn\u2019t a question of if the truth will come out, but when. Arie Posin directs this emotionally thorny drama about how we cope with loss, live in the moment and ultimately move forward.
