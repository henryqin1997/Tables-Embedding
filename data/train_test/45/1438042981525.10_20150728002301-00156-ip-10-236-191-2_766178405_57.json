All rights reserved., 130682=Cuban-American rapper Pitbull, born Armando Perez, toured large venues with labelmate Ke$ha in 2013 as he backed his seventh studio album, Global Warming. The album topped the U.S. rap chart and spawned the Top 10 hit \"Feel This Moment\" (featuring Christina Aguilera). The Miami-based star, who raps in both English and Spanish, has gained a reputation as a crowd-pleasing, suave performer, essentially serving as a great host who delivers the music his fans want to hear in concert. His live shows usually feature a few dancers, a band, and special guests who help him create a party atmosphere for the fans who scored tickets.}",
