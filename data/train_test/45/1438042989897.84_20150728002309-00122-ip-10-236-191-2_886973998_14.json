            "This school is great for the future doctors, high-up managers, and engineers of our society. If you're more of a liberal arts person, than this school may not be for you because even with the English majors, science and media is very prevalent in the course material.",
            "If you come here, don't get lost in your work. A lot of people meet their best of friends in college, but in order to that you have to stay active. I know the academic side can be difficult, but don't be afraid to join a club you're really interested in. Don't be afraid to leave campus and go to Centennial Park or go to that one restaurant you've great things about. Be prepared to balance work and play like you've never experienced it before.",
            "Since it's a public school, the tuition is cheaper than most. Plus, if you're a GA resident, than you're probably getting the HOPE scholarship, which already pays for tuition and fees if you have a 3.0 or greater as your GPA. You're learning from the best people in their respective fields without having to pay ivy league prices. It's definitely the best bang for your buck.",
            "The best part of this school, is that its campus is in Midtown Atlanta. I'm originally from New York City and I love the atmosphere. If nothing's going on on campus, which is actually quite rare, you could venture out a few blocks and explore the city, which is always fun for me personally.",
            "Georgia Tech has a rigorous course load because it is a technical school, where a majority of the majors are of course engineering programs. Students who wish to go here have to understand that it will be very different than learning in high school, because it's a lot more material at a faster pace. You may not know it at first, but you learn a lot of material once you're done with your classes."

It looks a lot like soft serve ice cream and students will put sticky note sprinkles on it., 360011=Don't let the classes take you by suprise. You were smart in High School, but so was everyone else at this place. You will discover quickly that your 4.0 in High School and your 2100 on the SAT does not take you very far when you get here. Study hard, study soon, don't procrastinate, and don't get Bellassard for Calc 2., 537011=Engineering students, and nerds who want to make an impact. (2013 Convocation speech: If you want to change the world, you can do that, you're at Georgia Tech. If you want to build the Ironman suit, you can do that, you're at Georgia Tech!), 417581=Freshman cupcake race: at roughly 6:45 in the morning, freshman are HIGHLY encouraged to participate in a semi-short race. Bright side: everyone gets a cupcake at the end, and the two top-finishers get a whole cake!, 720750=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 644424=Stealing the T of tech tower has long been a tradition, but is now considered vandalism and is illegal. Over spring break 2014 the T was stolen, but the student was caught and had to face a judicial hearing. They were going to press charges but the alumni stopped it. It takes a lot of work to steal the T, as it has been wired with sensory detectors, and the climb up to get it is very dangerous., 500451=May not seem like the money is worth it at the time, but Tech has one of the highest return on investment rankings., 48480=Tech has an enormous list of ongoing traditions, and to name them all here would be impossible, but perhaps the week that is surrounded with the most tradition is of course Homecoming week. During this week, many events take place, such as the Mini 500, a tricycle race around Peters Parking Deck, which is led by the Ramblin Wreck, a 1930 Ford Model A Sport Coupe that is one of Tech's mascots. It also leads the football team out at every football game and has been doing so since 1961. Also during Homecoming week is the Freshman Cake race, a mad dash where the prize is an entire cake, as well as a kiss from the Homecoming Queen during the halftime of that week's football game. I'll close this section out with Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate, the name bestowed upon the Tech - uga rivalry. All you need to know right now is TO HELL WITH georgia! (yes, the lowercase georgia is necessary)., 138614=They have programs for Freshman that are always entertaining, and brand new (relatively) West Campus dorms that were built for the 1996 Olympians., 135246=i'd definitely recommend submitting your application by november 1st for those juniors considering applying to gatech. i found out about my admittance by december 16th!!! now i have a lot more time to plan towards next year :d}",

If you are someone that likes the big city life-style with a great athletic environment and hundreds of extra curricular activities than Georgia Tech is the school for you. Tips for prospective students I recommend that you take both the ACT and the SAT. Although it's not required to take both, it makes you stand out among the crowd. Also, the more community service and volunteer experience you have, the better your chances of being accepted. Make sure to apply as early as possible. This is the case with all colleges and universities but I can not stress this enough. Georgia Tech receives more applicants that it can handle each year so the review process is lengthy. Apply before the early deadline to guarantee a possible acceptance. Sometimes students that apply for the regular deadline don't get accepted due to the fact that too many have already been admitted. Make sure to apply via paper application",
