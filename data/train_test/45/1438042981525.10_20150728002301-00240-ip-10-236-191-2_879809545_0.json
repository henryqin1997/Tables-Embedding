Come out n support!!, 34416=Coming off more like a veteran than his scant discography might suggest, Los Angeles-based rapper Glasses Malone makes his proper debut with Beach Cruiser, an album promised for 2007 and delivered in 2011. The delay was due to label problems according to Mr. Malone, and as such, there\u2019s a strange hodgepodge of logos on the back with Cash Money and Suburban Noize rubbing shoulders, but this is a worthy West Coast banger from end to end and much more coherent than expected. Names like Snoop Dogg and Mack 10 are here because of Malone\u2019s traditional G-funk style, while Birdman and Rick Ross find a home thanks to their host\u2019s convincing pimp hand. Akon and T-Pain\u2019s presences certify that this man is radio-worthy when he wants to be, and still, a highlight track with Jay Rock proves he can hang with the new breed, like Tech N9ne and such. Thanks to the large, powerful guest list, Malone\u2019s personality falls to the back at times, and his gruff Plies-meets-David Banner style certainly deserves more exploration. Still, his transfer from myth to man is hardly a letdown, and anyone with some Kurupt or Tha Dogg Pound in their collections will find his Left Coast grind satisfying and familiar., 38042=Born: December 10, 1978, 140254=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
