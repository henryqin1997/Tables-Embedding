    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students This school is great for students who are absolutely sure that they want to have a future in the medical field. Students should also be very dedicated, responsible, dependent, and hard-working. Tips for prospective students Don't be hesitant to apply, they accept a wide range of students and are very helpful throughout the admission process. If you are looking for an excellent school to study any type of medicine or pharmacy with a fast-paced curriculum, this is the college for you! Simply be prepared to constantly be studying and completing assignments to work toward your goal of a future in medicine. Bang for the buck For me, the high price of a private college education was very difficult at MCPHS. They offer a few merit scholarships, which were helpful. The financial aid was fairly generous, but the overall cost was still in a higher price range. After freshman year, housing is not available on campus. As a result, students have to find their own apartments for the rest of their time at school. Boston is a very expensive place to live, and finding an affordable apartment is close to impossible. Did enjoy being here I",
