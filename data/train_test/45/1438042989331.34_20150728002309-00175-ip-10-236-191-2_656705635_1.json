Like it or not, the casualties are one of the main influencing punk bands of today.\" \"wow all you cunts are pretty dumb take a history lesson, punk rock is GENERIC, punk rock is JUVERNILE, punk rock is made to sound like crap, and the only ones giving \"fashion statement\" wannabes outthere a chance to \"be\" punk would be all the fucking commercial bands that claim to be punk. Half you tools need to pull your head out of your ass and maybe think. \"hmm im i dont like punk rock its to generic for my taste, the sound is terrible maybe i should go listen to some barbie party mix or some shit\" if you dont like it fuck off and its always been about the music tarts\" - I \"like\" this one \"because\" he doesn't seem \"to\" understand when you're supposed \"to\" use quotation marks. \"Hey forty minus west you arragant prik fuck you that little jurnal is not fuckin funny ass hole suck one\"}",

Report xchemicalx (February 4, 2013) The only thing stranger (and more likely to be poorly received) than Goatwhore and Havok opening for the Casualties is Goatwhore and Havoc (from Mobb Deep) opening for the Casualties. While I'm sure it's the former, I wish it were the latter. Report",
