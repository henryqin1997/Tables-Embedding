Sufficient HCl is then added to lower the pH to about 4.0. The sample is then back-titrated with 0.1000 normal sodium hydroxide, using a Metrohm Potentiograph E-436 automatic titrator or equivalent apparatus, to the first inflection point in the pH titration curve.

These compositions are typically stable emulsions and although they are very useful and provide highly desirable coatings they are still subject to certain disadvantages, such as low throwing power and difficulty in controlling film thickness, attributed to the hydrophobic nature of the epoxy reaction products therein., 15013=United States Patent 1191 Bosso et al.

Usually the resin sample will be neutral. If, however, the resin is basic, the sample should be neutralized with a known amount of the acid present in the resin as a salt. Where the acid present in the resin as a salt is a weak acid as compared to I-ICI, the resin is titrated with I-ICl and back-titrated with sodium hydroxide on an automatic titrator. The HCl titration yields the total base groups present. The sodium hydroxide back-titration distinguishes quaternary groups from amine groups. For example, a typical analysis is conducted as follows: a 10 milliliter sample of an about 10 percent solids electrodeposition bath is pipetted in 60 milliliters of tetrahydrofuran. The sample is titrated with 0.1000 normal I-ICl to the pH end point. The amount of standard acid used is equivalent to the quaternary base and amine equivalents present. The sample is then back titrated with 0.1000 normal sodium hydroxide to give a titration curve with multiple end points. In a typical instance, the first end point corresponds to excess HCl. From the I-ICl titration, the second end point corresponds to the neutralization of the weak acid (for example, lactic acid) and amine hydrochloride. The difference in volume between the two endpoints gives the volume of standard base equivalent to the weak acid and amine content of the sample., 62445=Parts by Weight Epoxy resin 2000 Propylene gly ol (molecular weight 425) lsophorone 1S0 Dimethylbenzylamine 2.8, 15162=DISPERSION WITH BORIC ACID FOR ee CATIONIC ELECTRO-DEPOSITION 3,134,754 5/1964 Brunner et al 260/47 EC [75] Inventors: Joseph F.

There were added 58.5 parts of Monoalcohol A, 2.3 parts of stannous chloride and 28 parts of the dimethyl ether of diethylene glycol, and the mixture was heated at 150C. for 3 hours. The modified epoxy compound obtained contained oxyalkylene groups and had an epoxide equivalent of about 890. Two hundred parts of the modified epoxy compound wereheated to 70C. with stirring and then 13 parts of 2-(betadimethylaminoethoxy)-4-methyl-1,3,2-dioxaborinane were added over a 21 minute period, during which time the temperature rose to 92C. After five minutes there were added 1719 parts of deionized water, with stirring, along with sufficient formic acid to make the pH of the solution 4.4. There was obtained a colloidal dispersion having a non-volatile solids content of 9.1 percent. The solids component analyzes to contain quaternary base groups and boron. This dispersion was electrodeposited using steel electrodes and the following conditions:}",
