My question is when I applied about a month ago for the United 50k offer they told me since I earned the mileage bonus from United in 2011 I am not eligible for the bonus anymore because it is one time deal. I am just curious if you have ever earned the United bonus before via the Chase United card(or Continental card before) and how did you get the bonus again this time around? Any tips?, 28605=340,000 points is not an impressive churn.\u00a0 In January, my wife earned 305,000 points from only 4 cards.\u00a0 That said, the points I will earn are fantastically valuable.\u00a0 The collection of 55K United miles, 85K AA / US Airways miles, 100K Membership Rewards, and 100K Ultimate Rewards is awesome!\u00a0 I\u2019m psyched about the 100K Membership Rewards alone because they are more than enough for another flight on Singapore Airlines Suites class!\u00a0}",
