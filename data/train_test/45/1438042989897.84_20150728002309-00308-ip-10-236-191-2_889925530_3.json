            "This school is great for students who are absolutely sure that they want to have a future in the medical field. Students should also be very dedicated, responsible, dependent, and hard-working.",
            "Don't be hesitant to apply, they accept a wide range of students and are very helpful throughout the admission process. If you are looking for an excellent school to study any type of medicine or pharmacy with a fast-paced curriculum, this is the college for you! Simply be prepared to constantly be studying and completing assignments to work toward your goal of a future in medicine.",
            "For me, the high price of a private college education was very difficult at MCPHS. They offer a few merit scholarships, which were helpful. The financial aid was fairly generous, but the overall cost was still in a higher price range. After freshman year, housing is not available on campus. As a result, students have to find their own apartments for the rest of their time at school. Boston is a very expensive place to live, and finding an affordable apartment is close to impossible.",
            "I found the curriculum to be very stressful and time consuming. However, most of the professors were absolutely wonderful and helpful. There isn't much of a campus, this college only has two buildings where classes are held. It is surrounded by various medical buildings and hospitals, offering a wide range of volunteer and work opportunities while in school. Boston is a wonderful place to live, a lot of attractions, plenty of residential areas, and great people.",
            "For my freshman year at MCPHS, I completed a total of 32 credits as a Pre-Medical and Health Sciences major. I took many courses that satisfied my area of interest, including two biology courses, two chemistry courses, two calculus courses, and psychology. I learned an overwhelming amount of material and feel more than prepared for my sophomore year in any school I attend."

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students If you want to get active but not in sports but in student government or in your preprofessional organizations and can handle studying your butt off and working your way to earn your degree, it's worth it. There are literally no sports teams in the school. I don't know if you'd count our cheerleading team as a sport, even. At the school, you'd find mostly students who study and try to do well and pass all their classes. You also find people who don't fall into this category and depend on getting answers from others or copies of previous exams to pass the class. Those, usually don't do as well as those who actually study and learn the material thoroughly. Tips for prospective students I wish I can reverse time to save money. Don't think that everyone is going to laugh at you because you're going to a community college. I've learned it the hard way. Take all your core classes at a 2-year college, verify the credits will transfer, before you come to MCPHS. Even if those credits don't transfer, don't think MCPHS is your only option. Once you get all your core classes completed and it meets the requirements of other colleges/universities, you have a better chance of getting into that college. This school can be a real pain in the butt because the administrative make it that way.",
