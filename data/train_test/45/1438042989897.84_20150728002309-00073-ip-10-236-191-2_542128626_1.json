Leroy Lita scored the only goal of the game for the visitors with fifteen minutes remaining to condemn Leeds to their first defeat since the loss at home to Hull in mid-September. The result means Leeds have only picked up one point from two home games in the last week after Leeds drew 1-1 with Charlton in midweek. Despite the defeat, Warnock was less disappointed than in midweek and he felt they could have won the game. Speaking on Yorkshire Radio, Warnock said, \"I wasn`t as disappointed as I was the other night. The other night I thought it was a terrible game. \"I thought once we got a grip in the second half we could have gone on and won the game. \"Overall it was going to take a goal like they scored to win the game and we didn`t have it in our locker.\" Leeds failed to create many clear-cut chances and when they did, England goalkeeper Jack Butland was there to deny them. Rodolph Austin had Leeds best chance in the first half when the legs of Butland somehow kept out his fierce strike. In the second half, El Hadji Diouf fired over and he then saw his header saved by Butland, who also denied Leeds from the rebound. The clean sheet for Butland, was the first time Leeds have failed to score this season in all competitions having scored in all fifteen of their previous games. Leeds have little time to rest, as the game with Birmingham was the first of three games in six days. Southampton are at Elland Road on Tuesday night in the League Cup before they make the long trip to the South coast for a game at Brighton and Hove Albion on Friday night.
