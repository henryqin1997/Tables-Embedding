This is the receive mode of operation of the voice control DSP/CODEC circuit 306 corresponding to receiver block 1200 of FIG. 11 and corresponding to the decompression algorithm of FIG. 13. Thus the voice-control DSP/CODEC circuit 306 is processing the voice data in both directions in a full-duplex fashion., 127158=Next, the code book search and vector quantization function 1215 is performed. First, the voice control DSP circuit 306 computes the maximum sample value in the segment with the formula:, 33932=This patent application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/002,467 filed Jan. 8, 1993 now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 5,452,289 on Sep. 19, 1995 entitled \"COMPUTER-BASED MULTIFUNCTION PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM\", the complete application of which, including the microfiche appendix, is hereby incorporated by reference., 134020=Blocks 1405 and 1421 are gain control blocks gm and gs, respectfully. These digital gain controls are derived from tables for which the gain of the signal may be set to different levels depending upon the desired level for the voice signal. These gain levels can be set by the user through the level controls in the software as shown in FIG. 49. The gain on the digitized signal is set by multiplying a constant to each of the linear PCM samples., 43160=The ornamental features of the hardware components 20 of FIG. 1 are claimed as part of Design patent application No. 29/001368, filed Nov. 12, 1992 entitled \"Telephone/Modem case for a Computer-Based Multifunction Personal Communications System\" assigned to the same assignee of the present inventions and hereby incorporated by reference., 107613=The DC removal stage 1101 receives the digitized speech signal and removes the D.C. bias by calculating the long-term average and subtracting it from each sample. This ensures that the digital samples of the speech are centered about a zero mean value. The pre-emphasis stage 1103 whitens the spectral content of the speech signal by balancing the extra energy in the low band with the reduced energy in the high band., 85673=The Digital Telephone CODEC chip U12 is also shown in FIG. 9B which, in the preferred embodiment, is part number T7540 Digital Telephone CODEC manufactured and sold by AT&T Microelectronics. A more detailed description of this telephone CODEC chip U12 is described in the T7540 Digital Telephone CODEC Data Sheet and Addendum published July, 1991 by AT&T Microelectronics, which is hereby incorporated by reference., 78960=The main controller of controller circuit 313 and the support circuits 312, 314, 316, 317 and 308 are shown in FIGS. 5A-5C. In the preferred embodiment of the present system, the main controller is a Z80180 eight-bit microprocessor chip. In the preferred implementation, microcontroller chip U17 is a Z80180 microprocessor, part number Z84C01 by Zilog, Inc. of Campbell, Calif. (also available from Hitachi Semiconductor as part number HD64180Z). The Zilog Z80180 eight-bit microprocessor operates at 12 MHz internal clock speed by means of an external crystal XTAL, which in the preferred embodiment, is a 24.576 MHz crystal. The crystal circuit includes capacitors C4 and C5 which are 20 pf capacitors and resistor R28 which is a 33 ohm resistor. The crystal and support circuitry is connected according to manufacturer's specifications found in the Zilog Intelligent Peripheral Controllers Data Book published by Zilog, Inc. The product description for the Z84C01 Z80180 CPU from the Z84C01 Z80 CPU Product Specification pgs. 43-73 of the Zilog 1991 Intelligent Peripheral Controllers databook is hereby incorporated by reference., 134914=In voice over data mode, the output of gain control block gm is placed in a buffer for the voice compression/decompression algorithm 1425 instead of sample rate converter 1407. The samples in this mode are accumulated, as described above, and compressed for multiplexing and transmission by the main controller 313. Also in voice over data mode, the gain control block 1421 receives decompressed samples from the voice compression/decompression algorithm 1425 instead of sample rate converter 1423 for output., 135454=The echo canceler of FIG. 14 uses a least mean square (LMS) method of adaptive echo cancellation. The echo estimate signal subtracted from the incoming signal at 1403 is determined by function 1411. Function 1411 is a an FIR (finite impulse response) filter having in the preferred embodiment an impulse response which is approximately the length of delay though the acoustic path. The coefficients of the FIR filter are modeled and tailored after the acoustic echo path of the echo taking into account the specific physical attributes of the box that the speaker 304 and microphone 303 are located in and the proximity of the speaker 304 to the microphone 303. Thus, any signal placed on to the speaker is sent through the echo cancellation function 1411 to be subtracted from the signals received by the microphone 303 after an appropriate delay to match the delay in the acoustic path. The formula for echo replication of function box 1411 is: ##EQU8## and the result of the subtraction of the echo cancellation signal y(n) from the microphone signal y(n) is, 120525=A silence detection algorithm 1205 is also included in the programmed code of the DSP/CODEC 306. The silence detection function is a summation of the square of each sample of the voice signal over the frame. If the power of the voice frame falls below a preselected threshold, this would indicate a silent frame. The detection of a silence frame of speech is important for later multiplexing of the V-data and C-data described below. During silent portions of the speech, the main controller circuit 313 will transfer conventional digital data (C-data) over the telephone line in lieu of voice data (V-data). The formula for computing the power is ##EQU2##, 137901=In transmit mode, the main controller circuit 313 of FIG. 3 operates in the data service level 1505 to collect and buffer data from both the personal computer 10 (through the RS232 port interface 315) and the voice control DSP 306. In multiplex control level 1515, the main controller circuit 313 multiplexes the data and transmits that data out over the phone line 1523. In the receive mode, the main controller circuit 313 operates in the multiplex control level 1515 to de-multiplex the V-data packets and the C-data packets and then operates in the data service level 1505 to deliver the appropriate data packets to the correct destination: the personal computer 10 for the C-data packets or the voice control DSP circuit 306 for V-data., 118563=Referring to FIG. 11, the digital samples are shown as speech entering the transmitter block 1100. The transmitter block, of course, is the mode of operation of the voice-control DSP/CODEC circuit 306 operating to receive local digitized voice information, compress it and packetize it for transfer to the main controller circuit 313 for transmission on the telephone line. The telephone line connected to telephone line interface 309 of FIG. 3 corresponds to the channel 1111 of FIG. 11., 133059=Referring to FIG. 14 in conjunction with FIG. 3, the speech or analog voice signal is received through the telephone interface 301, 302 or 303 and is digitized by the digital telephone CODEC circuit 305 in an analog to digital conversion 1401. The CODEC for circuit 305 is a companding \u03bc-law CODEC. The analog voice signal from the telephone interface is band-limited to about 3,500 Hz and sampled at 8 kHz with each sample encoded into 8-bit PCM data producing a serial 64 kb/s signal. The digitized samples are passed to the voice control DSP of circuit 306 where they are immediately converted to 13-bit linear PCM samples., 136640=The LMS coefficient function 1413 provides adaptive echo cancellation coefficients for the FIR filter of 1411. The signal is adjusted based on the following formula: ##EQU9## where i=0, . . . N-1, 44714=FIG. 2 is an example of the Windows\ufffd-based main menu icon of the present system operating on a personal computer. The functions listed with the icons used to invoke those functions are shown in the preferred embodiment. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize that a wide variety of selection techniques may be used to invoke the various functions of the present system. The icon of FIG. 2 is part of Design patent application No. 29/001397, filed Nov. 12, 1992 entitled \"Icons for a Computer-Based Multifunction Personal Communications System\" assigned to the same assignee of the present inventions and hereby incorporated by reference., 136953=k=1000, 119361=The voice-control DSP/CODEC circuit 306 is programmed to first remove the DC component 1101 of the incoming speech. The DC removal is an adaptive function to establish a center base line on the voice signal by digitally adjusting the values of the PCM data. The formula for removal of the DC bias or drift is as follows: ##EQU1##, 80113=The Z80180 microprocessor in microcontroller chip U17 is intimately connected to a serial/parallel I/O counter timer chip U15 which is, in the preferred embodiment, a Zilog 84C90 CMOS Z80 KIO serial/parallel/counter/timer integrated circuit available from Zilog, Inc. This multi-function I/O chip U15 combines the functions of a parallel input/output port, a serial input/output port, bus control circuitry, and a clock timer circuit in one chip. The Zilog Z84C90 product specification describes the detailed internal operations of this circuit in the Zilog Intelligent Peripheral Controllers 1991 Handbook available from Zilog, Inc. Z84C90 CMOS Z80KIO Product specification pgs. 205-224 of the Zilog 1991 Intelligent Peripheral Controllers databook is hereby incorporated by reference., 152485=The transmission of the supervisory packet follows the CCITT V.42 standard, as is well known in the industry and as described in the CCITT Blue Book, volume VIII entitled Data Communication over the Telephone Network, 1989. The CCITT V.42 standard is hereby incorporated by reference. The ringdown voice data packet information follows the CCITT V.42 standard, but uses a different header format so the receiving site recognizes the difference between a data packet and a supervisory packet. The supervisory packet is distinguished from a data packet by using undefined bits in the header (80 hex) of the V.42 standard., 76960=CODEC chip U35 on FIG. 8B, interface chip U34 on FIG. 8A and digital signal processor (DSP) chip U37 on FIG. 8A comprise a data pump chip set manufactured and sold by AT&T Microelectronics. A detailed description of the operation of these three chips in direct connection and cooperation with one another is described in the publication entitled \"AT&T V.32bis/V.32/FAX High-Speed Data Pump Chip Set Data Book\" published by AT&T Microelectronics, December 1991, which is hereby incorporated by reference. This AT&T data pump chip set comprises the core of an integrated, two-wire full duplex modem which is capable of operation over standard telephone lines or leased lines. The data pump chip set conforms to the telecommunications specifications in CCITT recommendations V.32bis, V.32, V.22bis, V.22, V.23, V.21 and is compatible with the Bell 212A and 103 modems. Speeds of 14,400, 9600, 4800, 2400, 1200, 600 and 300 bits per second are supported. This data pump chip set consists of a ROM-coded DSP16A digital signal processor U37, and interface chip U34 and an AT&T T7525 linear CODEC U35. The AT&T V.32 data pump chip set is available from AT&T Microelectronics., 85159=The connections to DSP/CODEC chip U8 are shown split across FIGS. 9A and 9B. Address/data decode chips U9 and U10 on FIG. 9A serve to decode address and data information from the combined address/data bus for the dual port RAM chip U11 of FIG. 9B. The interconnection of the DSP/CODEC chip U8 shown on FIGS. 9A and 9B is described more fully in the WE\ufffd DSP16C Digital Signal Processor/CODEC Data Sheet published May, 1991 by AT&T Microelectronics, which is hereby incorporated by reference., 108051=The system finds the innovation in the current speech segment by subtracting 1109 the prediction from reconstructed past samples synthesized from synthesis stage 1107. This process requires the synthesis of the past speech samples locally (analysis by synthesis). The synthesis block 1107 at the transmitter performs the same function as the synthesis block 1113 at the receiver. When the reconstructed previous segment of speech is subtracted from the present segment (before prediction), a difference term is produced in the form of an error signal. This residual error is used to find the best match in the code book 1105. The code book 1105 quantizes the error signal using a code book generated from a representative set of speakers and environments. A minimum mean squared error match is determined in 5 ms segments. In addition, the code book is designed to provide a quantization error with spectral rolloff (higher quantization error for low frequencies and lower quantization error for higher frequencies). Thus, the quantization noise spectrum in the reconstructed signal will always tend to be smaller than the underlying speech signal., 89825=A special packet protocol is used for communication between the hardware components 20 and the personal computer (PC) 10. The protocol is used for transferring different types of information between the two devices such as the transfer of DATA, VOICE, and QUALIFIED information. The protocol also uses the BREAK as defined in CCITT X.28 as a means to maintain protocol synchronization. A description of this BREAK sequence is also described in the Statutory Invention Registration entitled \"ESCAPE METHODS FOR MODEM COMMUNICATIONS\", to Timothy D. Gunn filed Jan. 8, 1993, which is hereby incorporated by reference., 121583=The rest of the voice compression is operated upon in segments where there are four segments per frame amounting to 40 samples of data per segment. It is only the DC removal and silence detection which is accomplished over an entire 20 millisecond frame. The pre-emphasis 1207 of the voice compression algorithm shown in FIG. 12 is the next step. The formula for the pre-emphasis is, 72030=The detailed electrical schematic diagrams comprise FIGS. 5A-C, 6A-C, 7A-C, 8A-B, 9A-C and 10A-C. FIG. 4 shows a key on how the schematic diagrams may be conveniently arranged to view the passing of signals on the electrical lines between the diagrams. The electrical connections between the electrical schematic diagrams are through the designators listed next to each wire. For example, on the right side of FIG. 5A, address lines A0-A19 are attached to an address bus for which the individual electrical lines may appear on other pages as A0-A19 or may collectively be connected to other schematic diagrams through the designator \"A\" in the circle connected to the collective bus. In a like fashion, other electrical lines designated with symbols such as RNGL on the lower left-hand side of FIG. 5A may connect to other schematic diagrams using the same signal designator RNGL., 138732=In transmit mode, there are two data buffers, the V-data buffer 1511 and the C-data buffer 1513, implemented in the main controller RAM 316 and maintained by main controller 313. When the voice control DSP circuit 306 engages voice operation, it will send a block of V-data every 20 ms to the main controller circuit 313 through dual port RAM circuit 308. Each V-data block has one sign byte as a header and 23 bytes of V-data, as described in Table 15 below., 119903=Referring to FIG. 12, the voice compression algorithm in a control flow diagram is shown which will assist in the understanding of the block diagram of FIG. 11. The analysis and compression begin at block 1201 where the 13-bit linear PCM speech samples are accumulated until 160 samples representing 20 milliseconds of voice or one frame of voice is passed to the DC removal portion of code operating within the programmed voice control DSP/CODEC circuit 306. The DC removal portion of the code described above approximates the base line of the frame of voice by using an adaptive DC removal technique., 116010=In the voice-over-data mode of operation, voice control DSP/CODEC circuit 306 of FIG. 3 will be receiving digital voice PCM data from the digital telephone CODEC circuit 305, compressing it and transferring it to dual port RAM circuit 308 for multiplexing and transfer over the telephone line. This is the transmit mode of operation of the voice control DSP/CODEC circuit 306 corresponding to transmitter block 1100 of FIG. 11 and corresponding to the compression algorithm of FIG. 12., 136979=The echo cancellation of functions 1415 and 1417 are identical to the functions of 1413 and 1411, respectively. The functions 1407 and 1423 of FIG. 14 are sample rate conversions as described above due to the different sampling rates of the digital telephone CODEC circuit 305 and the voice control CODEC of circuit 306., 68553=The transmission of the digital data follows the CCITT V.42 standard, as is well known in the industry and as described in the CCITT Blue Book, volume VIII entitled Data Communication over the Telephone Network, 1989. The CCITT V.42 standard is hereby incorporated by reference. The voice data packet information also follows the CCITT V.42 standard, but uses a different header format so the receiving site recognizes the difference between a data packet and a voice packet. The voice packet is distinguished from a data packet by using undefined bits in the header (80 hex) of the V.42 standard. The packet protocol for voice over data transmission during the show and tell function of the present system is described more fully below., 125175=Next, the voice control DSP circuit 306 computes the LTP gain factor \u03b2 at 1211 using the following formula in which Sxy is the current segment and Sxx is the previous reconstructed segment: ##EQU4##, 126611=Next, the LTP (Long Term Predictor) filter function 1213 is computed. The pitch value computed above is used to perform the long-term analysis filtering to create an error signal e(n). The normalized error signals will be transmitted to the other site as an indicator of the original signal on a per sample basis. The filter function for the current segment is as follows:, 110230=On the receiving end 1200, the synthesis block at the receiver performs the same function as the synthesis block 1107 at the transmitter. The synthesis block 1113 reconstructs the original signal from the voice data packets by using the gain and pitch values and code book address corresponding to the error signal most closely matched in the code book. The code book at the receiver is similar to the code book 1105 in the transmitter. Thus the synthesis block recreates the original pre-emphasized signal. The de-emphasis stage 1115 inverts the pre-emphasis operation by restoring the balance of original speech signal., 124545=The value of j for which the peak occurs is the PITCH. This is a 7 bit value for the current segment calculated at 1209. The value of j is an indicator of the delay or lag at which the cross correlation matches the best between the past reconstructed segment and the current segment. This indicates the pitch of the voice in the current frame. The maximum computed value of j is used to reduce the redundancy of the new segment compared to the previous reconstructed segments in the present algorithm since the value of j is a measure of how close the current segment is to the previous reconstructed segments., 123249=The first step in the long term prediction is to predict the pitch of the voice segment and the second step is to predict the gain of the pitch. For each segment of 40 samples, a long-term correlation lag PITCH and associated LTP gain factor \u03b2j (where j=0, 1, 2, 3 corresponding to each of the four segments of the frame) are determined at 1209 and 1211, respectively. The computations are done as follows., 129960=Thus, for a segment of 40 samples, we will transmit 4 code book indexes corresponding to 4 subsegments of 10 samples each. After the appropriate index into the code book is chosen, the LTP filtered speech samples are replaced with the code book samples. These samples are then multiplied by the quantized GAIN in block 1217.}",
