            "I always felt really safe walking from one end of campus to another at night. Everything is lit up really well, there's emergency phones in multiple locations on campus that connect you directly to the university police, and once again, the campus has their own police department along with the City of Bozeman's police.",
            "There's so much you can do for fun on and around campus. Bozeman is a great location for city life and outdoor life. The downtown area is just a 10-15 minute walk from campus; there's two ski areas within an hour from Bozeman; there are rivers galore to go fishing, camping, hiking, or floating on; and of course there are all the activities on campus that you can join. There are intramural sports, the barn dances every Friday, you can always join your dorm's weekly activity or walk over to another dorm for theirs, there's Zombies vs. Humans every semester, and of course you can always attend any one of the many sporting events to cheer on your Bobcats!",
            "The food in the dining halls is good for the most part. There's always a variety. It just starts to feel like the same things towards the end of the year. Don't forget you can always make a trip to the Hedgehogs or the grocery store though!",
            "Living in the dorms is a once in a lifetime experience your freshman year. There's always some sort of activity you can participate in and there's more than ample opportunities to meet all sorts of new people. It's tight living, but if you talk it out with your roommate it's so easy to make things work. On your floor you become a family. The only thing that gets a little old is the dining hall food, but that's why there's the Hedgehogs and a grocery store right on campus.",
            "The academic rigor at MSU is fantastic as far as my experience goes. I have been challenged day in and day out to use my mind creatively and effectively in all my classes. Obviously some of the 100 level and below classes don't pose near as much of a challenge, but don't blow them off because they are preparing you to succeed in the higher level classes.",
            "Be open to new ideas and possibilities. Try something new every single day because you never know who you might meet or what you may end up liking. Don't be afraid to be yourself! Also study, study, study. Don't put things off until the last minute. Stay organized.",
            "Montana State University is a great place to study where you can be surrounded by a diversity of people, places and activities. It's in a great location with a multitude of outdoor activities, and a bit of city life to satisfy you too. The staff is great and they push you to your limits, but not too far to ensure you're getting the proper education."

Students run a 5k race in their underwear every November., 585210=If you love to ski/snowboard, and I mean REALLY love the snow, MSU is the place for you. In my first year here, there has been snow cover since november with temps in the -20s. Great, friendly people, and a great atmosphere for learning with lots of outlets for help in every class., 153188=Bring warm clothes! It's a lot colder starting in September than I would have imagined., 512599=If you like the outdoors, MSU is the place for you! Almost every one here rides a bike, skateboards, hikes, skis, snowboards, or all of the above! Also, MSU has a great engineering program, ranking very high in the US. There will also be a new business college in 2015 that focuses especially on those looking into entrepreneurship!, 543495=Get a good winter coat. Bozeman is sunny and beautiful all through september and most of october but after that the temperature drops rapidly, the snow flies, and the skiers come out of hibernation, 217645=There is an undies run in September where everyone goes running in their underwear even when it's snowing., 11810=If you are looking for great research or internship opportunities this is the place to be. Montana State is within the Nation's top tier for this! If you are a minority this would be a great place to go if interesting in the hard sciences, math, engineering, etc. But I would also like to add that with the past few years MSU lost about 9 million in funding. This is significant because programs across campus have been cut completely, some altered(budget cuts), some merged into other programs, and some may lose all funding in 2012., 20575=No doubt, I am learning a ton! The vacations are longer: Winter break is 17-Jan11 and summer starts May 5. Despite these relatively short semesters, the professors pile on the homework and I think that they truly care about theit students., 82463=They start placing people into the residence halls as soon as March so sign up early for housing in order to get the placement you want. Make sure to ask questions because everyone is willing to answer but they won't really double check to make sure everyone is doing fine. Talk to your professors.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Outdoorsy people, adventurous people, skiers, snowboarders, hikers, science students Tips for prospective students Come and visit! And ask questions during your visit. Also, be aware that it gets quite cold here, so you'll want warm clothes, and if you're not a snow and freezing temperatures person, you might not like it here. It is beautiful in the winter though! Bang for the buck MSU is amazing. The classes aren't huge, so it's easier to know a lot or all the people in your class, and it makes the professor and one-on-one time more accessible, which is a big plus. You are also provided with so many resources: the library has a person for pretty much every department who can help you do research or find what you're looking for, there's a Math Learning Center if you need more help in math, there's a Writing Center so you can have someone edit your papers and help you develop ideas and write better. I'm an out-of-state student as well, but I think MSU is definitely worth the money. I do like living on campus, but it's definitely cheaper to live off-campus, and it's definitely preferable to always eating the residence hall food. Am enjoying being here",
