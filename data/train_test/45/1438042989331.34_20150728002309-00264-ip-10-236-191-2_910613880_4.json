            "People who love the mountains, people who want to pursue music, education, or exercise science (they have some of the most advanced research in that field). I'm not going for any of those majors, but I think that those have the most people. People who love large but intimate campus communities. People who can handle the cold :)",
            "Don't miss scholarship deadlines :) Don't wait until the last minute to sign up for orientation. They fill up quick, and the First Year Seminars (which are required) fill up too, so the late ones end up having to wait until second semester to take it.",
            "Had I applied when I should have for merit scholarships, it would have been easier. Don't miss those deadlines! Other than that, they're willing to work with you however they can.",
            "If you love the mountains, a large but intimate campus community, and a small college town with tons of opportunity to get involved on and off campus then ASU is perfect. I can't get enough of the mountains and the outlets they have for student employment or just hanging out and having a good time are tough to beat. It's just a very intimate community, very personable.",
            "Since I have not started classes there yet, I can't speak for how much I will learn. However, at orientation the students who led us around on tours and helped advise us on our schedules talked only about how much they learned from their professors and how willing the professors and academic advisers were to make sure you succeeded. They especially emphasized personal responsibility- no one will help those who don't want to be helped. That stood out to me because I have always held myself accountable for my academics and extracurriculars."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{286062=The gazebo by the pond by a dining hall on the west side of campus is great for laying in a hammock or hanging out with friends. Students body paint at games in November. Tailgating is a big thing that happens before home football games. Homecoming events-Lip Sync(dancing and lip syncing to songs), Float Building party and parade, Kazoo band, banner contest, and blood drive., 154468=Tips: -Bring lots of warm clothing -Apply for financial aid as soon as you can -If you decide to stay off campus find a place no later than the end of July because it will be very hard to find a place to live -If you have any questions do not be afraid to ask, 141652=Blue lights. They also have safe ride between 6 pm to 2:30 am. free campus taxi. If you are hurt or sick or in danger campus police will escort you., 67384=Boone is a great college town. Whether it's a beautiful day in the spring or a cold day in December, there is always something to do. Head out to Sanford Mall and play ultimate frisbee when it's warm. Travel to the nearby ski resorts and go skiing and snowboarding when it's snowy! There are plenty of places to have fun with friends., 438082=Appalachian State is a fantastic school but it is at a higher elevation and because of this there is a decent amount of winter weather. Make sure that you are comfortable with the cold, as the winter really starts around middle of November and persists through March. Come up to App with an open mind, and willingness to explore new subjects of study! Appalachian has a rather complicated general education program that really forces your to explore a lot of different topics of study. Be willing to try out new or previously uninteresting subjects! Some of the best classes here are the ones that sound really strange on paper., 85696=There's something about Appalachian and Boone that makes you feel right at home, no matter where you're from. It is a gorgeous place to go to school; you have great leaves to take pictures of during fall, snow in winter, and moderate/comfortable temperatures from April to September for the most part. Football games are great ways to enjoy being a part of an active student body, for everyone is donned in black and gold, screaming at the top of your lungs for the Mountaineers. There are many clubs and organizations you can be involved with; and if it's not here, you can form a club catering to your interests following the set club-forming guidelines. There's always something to do on campus and most of it's free, which is nice; if you have a big test coming up, there are plenty of peaceful places to study on campus., 641276=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 313718=Polar Plunge is held toward the end of January every year, people jump into Duck Pond with costumes on. Every summer, The Appalachian Summer Festival is held. This year, Bill Cosby is going to be here!, 31664=Prospective students should apply to Appalachian with the greatest of their credentials. It is no easy school to be accepted into, nor is it as competitive as Chapel Hill. Any activities and extracurriculars one might have been committed to are great advantages to your application. And remember, bring your snow gear because we see flakes from October to April. With a diverse community, diverse climate, and wonderful classrooms, I guarantee you'll enjoy what Boone, NC has to offer you from Appalachian State University., 207041=At Appalachian State University students are welcome to Fraternity and Sorority Life. There are over 1400 members of the 26 Fraternities and Sororities present on campus. Not only do they serve as a resource for the current Fraternity and Sorority community, but offers a clearinghouse of information for perspective students, parents and alumni., 584688=I would rate Appalachian State University a 8 out of 10. I toured the campus and I received a better understanding of the school that I will be attending. The tour mentors, the staff, and the students who attend the school were very helpful in teaching me about furthering my educational career path in the Fall of 2014.}",

Especially those that love the mountains or just want a great college experience! Tips for prospective students Apply for early registration and you have a better chance of getting in! With the amount of people applying growing every year, it's important to get your application in early, as well as any scholarships or financial aid through the university. Am enjoying being here I absolutely love being at App State! The campus is so beautiful, and there are so many things to do. You can go to the Student Union and hang out in the coffee shop, or if it is an exceptionally pretty day, it's great just sitting outside enjoying the amazing Boone weather. At night, you can usually catch a movie for just a dollar or even",
