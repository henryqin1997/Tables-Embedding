Prior to the AASLD Guideline, Ratziu and colleagues published a position statement summarizing the proceedings of the 2009 European Association for the Study of The Liver\u2019s (EASL) conference on NAFLD/NASH, and Sanyal and colleagues [12] summarized the consensus of a 2009 AASLD research workshop on endpoints and clinical trial design for NASH. The AASLD Guideline [7] definitions are provided in Figure 1., 84137=Haufe and colleagues [64] randomized 170 overweight and obese individuals to a 6-month dietary intervention with hypocaloric diets (30% reduction from usual caloric intake, to a minimum of 1200 cal/day) consisting of low-carbohydrate (\u226490 g/day), moderate-protein (0.8 g/kg/day) or reduced-fat (<20%), moderate-protein (0.8 g/kg/day) intake with the remaining calorie content from carbohydrates. Of 102 subjects that completed the dietary interventions, decreased body weight and improvements in body composition, visceral fat, and intrahepatic lipid content were observed in both groups. There were not significant changes in intrahepatic lipid content, measured by fat spectroscopy, but subjects with high baseline intrahepatic lipids (>5.56%) lost approximately 7-fold more intrahepatic lipid than those with lower baseline values. These results suggest that in the longer term of 6-months, both low-carbohydrate/high-protein and low-fat diets may be beneficial. However, there is insufficient evidence to provide recommendations on protein intake specific for NAFLD, and following the ADA [8,9,10] and DGAs [49] appear appropriate (Table 2)., 18504=Nutrients 2013, 5(10), 4093-4114; doi:10.3390/nu5104093, 192391=\u00a9 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

High amounts of SFAs and low amounts of n-3 PUFA consumption are associated with oxidative stress, decreased FAO, and depletion of PUFAs in the liver [70]. Similar to n-3 PUFAs, diets low in MUFAs are associated with decreased levels of PPAR\u03b1 particularly in the context of insulin resistance [71]. Dietary patterns rich in n-3 PUFAs and MUFAs may play an important role in preventing and treating NAFLD, as well as improving lipid metabolism in insulin resistant individuals [9,72].}",
