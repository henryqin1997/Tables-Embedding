The accuracy of this technique has not yet been proven, and is not likely to be much more than that offered by the recognition of fingerprints. It requires illumination of the finger with a plurality of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) of various colors, and analysis of the light transmitted by the skin at various distances, using a number of photodiodes to measure the characteristics of this light: when the distance between the light emitter and the sensor is larger, commensurately deeper characteristics of the dermis will be obtained. Some frequency bands (toward the infrared) are furthermore very sensitive to the presence of blood. The number of photodiodes and light-emitting diodes will be limited by the fact that it is necessary to assemble them individually, and the associated cost therefore increases very rapidly.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Referenced by the device may be used one or more times for more reliable identification of a person: several fingers may be checked, or a fingerprint may be checked on one finger and the spectral information on another finger. the finger may be guided by a finger guide in order to facilitate the correlation between the fingerprint acquisition and the spectral information measurements; for the spectral print acquisition, a wavelength may be used which serves to detect blood in the finger and/or the oxygen level in hemoglobin; if the sensor is optical, the light source may be shared by the fingerprint acquisition and the spectral information acquisition; the fingerprint sensor may be an optical sensor, although it may also be a capacitive, thermal, pressure or current flow sensor; the light-emitting diodes may be integrated, to the extent which technology allows, in the chip constituting the fingerprint sensor; The following possibilities are also envisaged according to the present invention: It will be possible to separate the LEDs which are used as an illumination source for the print acquisition (by arranging them uniformly in order to illuminate the finger as well) from those which are used for the spectral image acquisition. Nevertheless it will be less expensive to share",
