    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{51680=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) enforces the Resource Conservation & Recovery Act (RCRA) which was enacted in 1976 in order to control the disposal of harmful or hazardous waste materials. There are currently over 100,000 drugs commercially available in the United States, of which about 14,000 are considered hazardous by RCRA requirements. A typical medium size hospital utilizes thousands of different drugs in a year of which hundreds are considered hazardous. The EPA is increasingly enforcing hospitals' compliance with the RCRA requirements because it has been shown in several studies that the 72 million pounds of pharmaceutical waste generated each year by hospitals is contributing to the pollution of groundwater and endocrine system damage in humans and other species. In addition, many organizations including Hospital for a Healthy Environment (H2E) and Joint Council for Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) are pressing hospitals to be more environmentally friendly. In view of these changes, hospitals are increasing efforts to audit their own compliance with the laws. As a result, these hospitals are becoming more aware of the difficulty of sorting the numerous pharmaceutical waste streams that the EPA, Department of Transportation (DOT), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and some states require., 138140=In operation, the individual photo detectors 236 pick up light transmitted through the container and output corresponding signals to a processor 242. On one hand, the light intensity arriving at the detectors 236 depends on the fill level of the container 80. In addition, a number of secondary factors also effect the light intensity reaching the detectors 236. These include the strength of the light source 230, the color and opacity of the container 80, the amount of ambient light, and other factors such as dust in the air. The light intensity at the top detector row 2244 is almost completely governed by these secondary factors, since it is located well above the fill line 240. By contrast, the light intensity arriving at the middle 246 and lower 248 detector rows will be effected more by the fill level of the container contents as the container 80 becomes more full (e.g., as the fill level approaches the fill line)., 50863=This is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/946,252, filed on Sep. 21, 2004, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/945,223, filed on Sep. 20, 2004, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/504,170 filed Sep. 19, 2003 and application Ser. No. 60/589,118, filed Jul. 19, 2004, all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties., 136529=In some embodiments, the upper and middle rows can be spaced by a distance 250 of between about \ufffd\u2033 and about 2 inches, in other embodiments the upper and middle rows can be spaced by a distance 250 of between about 1 inch and about 1\ufffd inches, and in one particular embodiment, the upper and middle rows are spaced by a distance 250 of about 1\ufffd inches. Similarly, the middle and lower rows can be spaced by a distance 252 of between about \ufffd\u2033 and about 2 inches, in other embodiments, the middle and lower rows can be spaced by a distance 252 of between about 1 inch and about 1\ufffd inches, and in one particular embodiment, the middle and lower rows are spaced by a distance 252 of about 1\ufffd inches. In some embodiments, the detectors 236 of the middle 246 and lower 248 rows are spaced horizontally by a distance 2254 of between about \ufffd inch and about 3 inches, in other embodiments, the detectors 236 of the middle 246 and lower 248 rows are spaced horizontally by a distance 254 of between about 1 inch and about 2 inches, and in one particular embodiment by a horizontal distance 254 of about 1\ufffd inches. In some embodiments, the sensors are evenly spaced, while in other embodiments, the sensors of the middle row are horizontally spaced differently than the sensors of the lower row. In further alternative embodiments, the spacing of the detectors 236 can be determined by factors such as the size of the container or the material to be placed within the container., 53065=More than 3.2 million tons of medical waste is generated by hospitals, medical clinics and pharmaceutical manufacturers each year. Half of this waste is considered infectious. Most of the infectious waste was treated in over 2400 incinerators throughout the country, until 1998 when the EPA began to enforce tough environmental emission laws that have reduced the number of incinerators to just over a hundred nationwide. Now much of the infectious waste is hauled to these remaining incinerators, often a substantial distance, or is treated by alternative technologies such as autoclaves and chemical processors. There is very little choice for hospitals because of the upfront cost and large footprint of the processing equipment. Although many companies have offered different kinds of equipment, the prices vary from a few hundred thousand dollars for smaller units to a few million for large units. Because of the long cycling times to decontaminate the waste, the equipment typically is very large in order to provide acceptable throughput. There are also several companies that provide a service to hospitals by utilizing chemical processors mounted on trucks. They go to a facility and decontaminate the infectious waste, allowing the treated waste to be hauled to a local landfill. There are concerns that this technology may not completely treat the waste in all circumstances and the chemical residue left after processing may remain an ecological issue.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although certain embodiments and examples have been described herein, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that many aspects of the methods and devices shown and described in the present disclosure may be differently combined and/or modified to form still further embodiments. Additionally, it will be recognized that the methods described herein may be practiced using any device suitable for performing the recited steps. Such alternative embodiments and/or uses of the methods and devices described above and obvious modifications and equivalents thereof are intended to be within the scope of the present disclosure. Thus, it is intended that the scope of the present invention should not be limited by the particular embodiments described above, but should be determined only by a fair reading of the claims that follow. In one embodiment, a system for a service to analyze and implement reductions in hospital hazards is provided. Implementing the solutions with hospital personnel will be a process similar to making cost reductions in organizations with significant numbers of administrative procedures. Although nanoemulsion disinfectants and microfiber materials for cleaning and disinfection have worked successfully to reduce toxicity, much opportunity remains to improve the hospital environment, making it safer for the healthcare worker. Reducing hospital hazards will also result in savings to the hospital. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, hospitals and nursing facilities are among the most hazardous work environments.",
