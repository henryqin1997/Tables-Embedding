Most of the desktop managers available from PC-BSD\u00ae should automatically mount the following filesystems: FAT16, FAT32, EXT2, EXT3 (without journaling), EXT4 (read-only), NTFS5, NTFS6, and XFS. See the section on Files and File Sharing for more information about available file manager utilities. BSD and Linux use different filesystems during installation. Many Linux distros use EXT2, EXT3, EXT4, or ReiserFS, while PC-BSD\u00ae uses UFS or ZFS. This means that if you wish to dual-boot with Linux or access data on an external drive that has been formatted with another filesystem, you will want to do a bit of research first to see if the data will be accessible to both operating systems. [edit] Filesystems 5 Additional Resources 4 Commands 3 Feature Names 2 Device Names 1 Filesystems Contents PC-BSD\u00ae is based on BSD Unix[1], meaning that it is not a Linux distribution. If you have used Linux before, you will find that some features that you are used to have different names on a BSD system and that some commands are different. This section covers",
    "textAfterTable": "[edit] Device Names Linux and BSD use different naming conventions for devices. For example: in Linux, Ethernet interfaces begin with eth; in BSD, interface names indicate the name of the driver. For example, an Ethernet interface may be listed as re0, indicating that it uses the Realtek re driver. The advantage of this convention is that you can read the man 4 page for the driver (e.g. type man 4 re) to see which models and features are provided by that driver. BSD disk names differ from Linux. IDE drives begin with ad and SCSI and USB drives begin with da. [edit] Feature Names Some of the features used by BSD have similar counterparts to Linux, but the name of the feature is different.
