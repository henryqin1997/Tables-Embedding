Although the description above contains many specificities, these should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention but as merely providing illustrations of some of the presently preferred embodiments of this invention. For example, the simulation model can be programmed using a general purpose language rather than a simulation language; determination of optimal staffing can be based on criteria rather than the minimum total cost including the utilization of crews or the time to respond to a repair request; standardization of crews can be totally discarded; different logic can be developed for the simulation events; performance prediction models can be used for anticipating future maintenance workloads, etc. 9. Offers not only a management tool for determining the optimal staffing but also an administrative technique for running maintenance operations. 8. Provides a means to integrate the maintenance resource structure, maintenance strategy, and overall maintenance department objectives. 7. Offers a tool that indirectly determines the amount and type of work to be contracted. 6. Maximizes the cost-effectiveness of staffing by minimizing the total cost for the public and maintenance department. 5. Utilizes the advanced technique of discrete-event simulation to model the repair request system and run the developed model under various scenarios to find the best scenario. 4. The simple highway maintenance model",
