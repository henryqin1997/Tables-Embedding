Thus when switching e.g. in High Contrast mode the exchange of the standard bitmaps to specialized ones is done automatically for the most common cases (Toolbars, etc.). FS will contact MBA to get informed with the details and the future of this feature and what has to be done by the VUI Team. 3 Automatically collection of infos on used bitmaps during Update Process While discussing which bitmaps are still in use and which are obsolete and how to find them out, one suggested to collect infos on all used bitmaps during Update Process to get an up to date and complete overview. There was no decision on if, when and how. 4 High Contrast mode for Paragraph Preview window It was mentioned, that also the preview window for \"Indents & Spacing\" and \"Alignment\" of Paragraphs has to be enabled for High Contrast mode. So this will become a future task for the VUI Team Page 1 of 1",
