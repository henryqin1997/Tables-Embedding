Thus the breakdown voltage when tested at either 60 A or 250 A is at most 1000 volts, preferably at most 800 volts, particularly at most 700 volts, especially at most 600 volts, more especially at most 500 volts, e.g. 200 to 500 volts, and the final insulation resistance is at least 108 ohms, as described above. It is preferred that the breakdown voltage be relatively stable over multiple cycles of the test, i.e. for any given cycle, the breakdown voltage varies from the average breakdown voltage for fifty cycles by \ufffd70%, preferably by \ufffd50%. When the composition of the invention is formed into a standard device as described below and exposed to a standard impulse breakdown test, the device has an initial breakdown voltage VSi and a final breakdown voltage VSf which is from 0.70 VSi to 1.30 VSi, preferably from 0.80 VSi to 1.20 VSi, particularly from 0.85 VSi to 1.15 VSi, especially from 0.90 VSi to 1.10 VSi., 22684=Devices comprising electrically non-linear compositions are known for protecting electrical equipment and circuitry. The compositions used in such devices often exhibit non-linear electrical resistivity, decreasing in resistivity from an insulating state, i.e. more than 106 ohm-cm, to a conducting state when exposed to a voltage that exceeds a threshold value. This value is known as the breakdown voltage. Compositions exhibiting non-linear electrical behavior are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,977,357 (Shrier) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,294,374 (Martinez et al), and in co-pending, commonly assigned U.S. patent applications Ser. No. 08/046,059 (Debbaut et al, filed Apr. 10, 1993), now U.S. Pat. No. 5,557,250, issued Sep. 17, 1996, application Ser. No. 08/251,878 (Simendinger et al, filed Jun. 1, 1994), and application Ser. No. 08/481,028 (Simendinger et al, filed Jun. 7, 1995), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference., 66030=Monolayer devices which contained only a first resistive element made from a composition containing aluminum powder dispersed in a silicone, shown, for example in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/251,878, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, had a breakdown voltage of more than 1000 volts when tested using a 10\ufffd1000 microsecond waveform and a current of at most 1 A. They did not survive fifty cycles when tested at 60 A., 49455=The electrical device comprises first and second electrodes which are positioned so that, when the device is connected to a source of electrical power, current can flow between the electrodes through the first and second resistive elements. Generally the first electrode is attached to the first resistive element, and the second electrode to the second resistive element, but if the device comprises a center first resistive element sandwiched between two second resistive elements, the first electrode may be positioned in contact with one second resistive element and the second electrode may be positioned in contact with the other second resistive element. Similarly, if the device comprises a center second resistive element between two first resistive elements, the first and second electrodes may be positioned in contact with the two first resistive elements. The type of electrode is dependent on the shape of the first and second elements, but is preferably laminar and in the form of a metal foil, metal mesh, or metallic ink layer. The first electrode has a first resistivity and the second electrode has a second resistivity, both of which are generally less than 1\ufffd10-2 ohm-cm, preferably less than 1\ufffd10-3 ohm-cm, particularly less than 1\ufffd10-4 ohm-cm. Particularly suitable metal foil electrodes comprise microrough surfaces, e.g. electrodeposited layers of nickel or copper, and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,689,475 (Matthiesen), U.S. Pat. No. 4,800,253 (Kleiner et al), and pending U.S. application Ser. No. 08/255,584 (Chandler et al, filed Jun. 8, 1994), now abandoned in favor of file wrapper continuation application Ser. No. 08/672,496, filed Jun. 28, 1996 the disclosure of each of which is incorporated herein by reference., 52512=The first and second polymeric components may be cured by any suitable means, including heat, light, microwave, electron beam, or gamma irradiation, and are often cured by using a combination of time and temperature suitable to substantially cure the polymeric components. The curing temperature Tc may be at any temperature that allows substantial curing of the polymeric component, i.e. that cures the polymeric component to at least 70%, preferably at least 80%, particularly at least 90% of complete cure. When the curable polymeric component is a thermosetting resin which has a glass transition temperature Tg, it is preferred that the curing be conducted at a curing temperature Tc which is greater than Tg. A catalyst, e.g. a platinum catalyst, may be added to initiate the cure and control the rate and/or uniformity of the cure. When the polymeric component is a gel, it is preferred that, when cured without any filler, the gel be relatively hard, i.e. have a Voland hardness of at least 100 grams, particularly at least 200 grams, especially at least 300 grams, e.g. 400 to 600 grams, in order to minimize disruption of the aligned particles when exposed to a high energy condition. In addition, it is preferred that the cured gel have stress relaxation of less than 25%, particularly less than 20%, especially less than 15%. The Voland hardness and stress relaxation are measured using a Voland-Stevens Texture Analyzer Model LFRA having a 1000 gram load cell, a 5 gram trigger, and a 0.25 inch (6.35 mm) ball probe, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,079,300 (Dubrow et al), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. To measure the hardness of a gel, a 20 ml glass scintillating vial containing 10 grams of gel is placed in the analyzer and the stainless steel ball probe is forced into the gel at a speed of 0.20 mm/second to a penetration distance of 4.0 mm. The Voland hardness value is the force in grams required to force the ball probe at that speed to penetrate or deform the surface of the gel the specified 4.0 mm. The Voland hardness of a particular gel may be directly correlated to the ASTM D217 cone penetration hardness using the procedure described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,852,646 (Dittmer et al), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference., 51259=Depending on the type of the polymeric components and the electrodes, it may be desirable to cure the first and second compositions directly in contact with the electrodes. Alternatively, it is possible to cure the compositions partially or completely before attaching the electrodes to the cured compositions. The latter technique is especially appropriate for use with mesh or other foraminous electrode materials. In order to control the thickness of the first and second resistive elements, the uncured composition may be poured or otherwise positioned within a mold of specified thickness, and then cured. For some applications, improved electrical stability for the device may be achieved if at least one and preferably both of the electrodes is both electrically conductive and has at least some portion which is magnetic. Electrodes of this type include nickel, nickel-coated copper, and stainless steel. It is preferred that the entire surface of the electrode comprise the magnetic material. Similar electrodes and techniques may be used to prepare electrical devices as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/482,064 (Munch et al, filed Jun. 7, 1995), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference., 60386=A standard device 27 was inserted into the test fixture 29 shown in FIG. 2. Two copper cylinders 31,33, approximately 19 mm (0.75 inch) in diameter, were mounted in a polycarbonate holder 35 such that the end faces 37,39 were parallel. One end 37 was fixed and immobile; the other end 39 was free to travel while still maintaining the parallel end-face geometry. Movement of cylinder 33 was controlled by barrel micrometer 41 mounted through mounting ring 43. Device 27 was mounted between cylinders 31,33, and micrometer 41 was adjusted until contact with zero compressive pressure was made to both sides of device 27. Pressure was then applied to device 27 by further moving cylinder 33 (via micrometer 41) to compress the sample 10% (generally 0.1 to 0.3 mm). Electrical leads 45,47 were connected from copper cylinders 31,33 to the testing equipment (not shown). Prior to testing, the insulation resistance Ri for the device was measured at 25\ufffd C. with a biasing voltage of 50 volts using a Genrad 1864 Megaohm meter; the initial resistivity \u03c1i was calculated. Electrical connection was then made to a Keytek ECAT Series 100 Surge Generator using an E514A 10\ufffd1000 waveform generator. For each cycle a high energy impulse with a 10\ufffd1000 \u03bcs current waveform (i.e. a rise time to maximum current of 10 \u03bcs and a half-height at 1000 \u03bcs) and a peak current of 60 A was applied. The peak voltage measured across the device at breakdown, i.e. the voltage at which current begins to flow through the gel, was recorded as the impulse breakdown voltage. The final insulation resistance Rf after fifty or one hundred cycles for the standard test was measured and the final resistivity \u03c1f was calculated., 30281=The electrical device of the invention comprises at least two resistive elements which, in the preferred embodiment, are in physical and electrical contact with each other. In this specification, the term \"electrical contact\" means having electrical continuity and includes configurations in which there may not be direct physical contact. The first resistive element is composed of a first composition which exhibits electrically non-linear behavior. In this specification the term \"non-linear\" means that the composition is substantially electrically non-conductive, i.e. has a resistivity of more than 106 ohm-cm, and preferably more than 108 ohm-cm, when an applied voltage is less than the impulse breakdown voltage, but then becomes electrically conductive, i.e. has a resistivity of substantially less than 106 ohm-cm, when the applied voltage is equal to or greater than the impulse breakdown voltage. For many applications, it is preferred that the composition have a resistivity in the \"nonconducting\" state of more than 108 ohm-cm, particularly more than 109 ohm-cm, especially more than 1010 ohm-cm, and a resistivity in the \"conducting\" state of less than 103 ohm-cm., 68848=Following the procedure of Examples 1 to 15, a first composition was prepared containing 30% aluminum (-200 mesh), 10% zinc borate, 10% potassium permanganate, and 50% silicone gel (as in Example 1), and a second composition was prepared containing 11.25% nickel with a mesh size of -100 to +200 (available from Alfa Aesar, with an average particle size of about 100 microns), 3.75% nickel with a mesh size of -300, 20% zinc borate, 10% potassium permanganate, and 55% silicone gel (as in Example 1), all percentages by volume of each total composition. A Standard Device was prepared and tested 50 cycles at 60 A with a 10\ufffd1000 microsecond waveform. The average breakdown voltage was 318 volts, with a standard deviation of 27. Both Ri and Rf were 1\ufffd1011 ohms. The test results are shown in FIG. 6., 25848=In order to provide maximum protection, it is preferred that the breakdown voltage of the device be relatively low, e.g. less than 500 volts, so that the device will operate under fault conditions in which the applied voltage is relatively low. It is also preferred that the breakdown voltage be relatively constant after multiple fault conditions. In order to effectively and repeatedly provide protection, it is preferred that the device have a relatively stable insulation resistance, i.e. an insulation resistance of more than 1\ufffd109 ohms after exposure to a breakdown voltage is usually required. Furthermore, it is desirable that the device have the capability to withstand high energy fault conditions such as a lightning-type surge, i.e. a 10\ufffd1000 microsecond current waveform and a peak current of 60 A. We have now found that a device which comprises at least two layers of different materials can exhibit each of these features. In a first aspect this invention provides an electrical device which comprises, 62207=The first and second resistive elements for Examples 1 to 15 were prepared from compositions using the formulations shown in Table I. In each case the silicone gel was formulated using 49.420% 1000 cs divinyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane (available from United Chemical Technology (UCT)), 49.956% 50 cs silicone oil (polydimethylsiloxane fluid from UCT), 0.580% tetrakis(dimethyl siloxy silane) (UCT), 0.04% catalyst, and 0.004% inhibitor, all amounts by weight of the composition. The stoichiometry was adjusted for peak hardness, i.e. 600 grams using a Voland texture analyzer with a 7 mm stainless steel probe. The aluminum was a powder with an average particle size of 15 to 20 microns (-200 mesh) and a substantially spherical shape, available from Aldrich Chemicals. The nickel, available from Alfa Aesar, had a mesh size of -300 mesh and an average particle size of 3 to 10 microns. The arc suppressing agents, i.e. magnesium phosphate (Mg3 (PO4)2.8H2 O), zinc phosphate (Zn3 (PO4)2.2H2 O), calcium phosphate (CaHPO4.2H2 O), iron oxalate (FeC2 O4.2H2 O), and zinc borate (3ZnO.2B2 O3), the oxidizing agents, i.e. bismuth subnitrate (4BiNO3 (OH)2.BiO(OH)) and lead peroxide (PbO2), and the surge initiators, i.e. calcium carbonate (CaCO3, decomposition temperature 898\ufffd C.), manganese oxalate (MnC2 O4.2H2 O, decomposition temperature 100\ufffd C.), and iron oxalate (which also acts as an arc suppressing agent, decomposition temperature 190\ufffd C.), were available from Alfa Aesar. Standard devices were prepared as above and tested using the Standard Impulse Breakdown Test for either 50 or 100 cycles, as indicated. (Testing for Example 11 was done at 100 A rather than 60 A.) In each case, except for comparative Examples 5 and 7, the devices had Ri greater than 109 ohms. For Examples 5 and 7 the value of Ri was greater than 108 ohms. The average breakdown voltage over the total number of test cycles and the standard deviation (i.e. a measure of the reproducibility of the breakdown voltage) are shown in Table I., 56654=The first resistive element acts as a \"switch\" due to its non-linear nature, and controls the breakdown voltage of the device. However, if exposed to a very high energy pulse, e.g. a 10\ufffd1000 microsecond current waveform and a peak current of 300 \u212b, a small region in the first resistive element will short out if not in contact with the second resistive element. The second resistive element acts as a \"point-plane\" electrode. Each of the domains, generally in the form of columns, behaves as a microfuse which can be destroyed by the breakdown event. As a result, even if an affected portion of the first resistive element shorts out, a corresponding domain in the second resistive element will be destroyed, and will disconnect the shorted section of the first resistive element from the circuit. The device thus returns to a nonconductive state after the breakdown event. In addition, the electric field is concentrated at the tip of each domain or column, thus increasing the repeatability of the breakdown voltage on successive electrical events., 54874=The device of the invention is nonconductive, i.e. has an insulation resistance at 25\ufffd C. of more than 106 ohms, preferably more than 108 ohms, particularly more than 109 ohms, especially more than 1010 ohms. The resistance of the second resistive element at 25\ufffd C., if measured on its own, not in contact with the first resistive element, is at most 1000 ohms, preferably at most 100 ohms, particularly at most 10 ohms, especially at most 1 ohm., 33240=For many applications it is preferred that the first and/or the second polymeric component comprise a polymeric gel, i.e. a substantially dilute crosslinked solution which exhibits no flow when in the steady-state. The crosslinks, which provide a continuous network structure, may be the result of physical or chemical bonds, crystallites or other junctions, and must remain intact under the use conditions of the gel. Most gels comprise a fluid-extended polymer in which a fluid, e.g. an oil, fills the interstices of the network. Suitable gels include those comprising silicone, e.g. a polyorganosiloxane system, polyurethane, polyurea, styrene-butadiene copolymers, styrene-isoprene copolymers, styrene-(ethylene/propylene)-styrene (SEPS) block copolymers (available under the tradename Septon\u2122 by Kuraray), styrene-(ethylene-propylene/ethylene-butylene)-styrene block copolymers (available under the tradename Septon\u2122 by Kuraray), and/or styrene-(ethylene/butylene)-styrene (SEBS) block copolymers (available under the tradename Kraton\u2122 by Shell Oil Co.). Suitable extender fluids include mineral oil, vegetable oil, paraffinic oil, silicone oil, plasticizer such as trimellitate, or a mixture of these, generally in an amount of 30 to 90% by volume of the total weight of the gel without filler. The gel may be a thermosetting gel, e.g. silicone gel, in which the crosslinks are formed through the use of multifunctional crosslinking agents, or a thermoplastic gel, in which microphase separation of domains serves as junction points.
