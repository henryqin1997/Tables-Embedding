Cabaret Voltaire formed in 1973, around Richard H. Kirk, Stephen Mallinder and Chris Watson. Initially utilizing minimal electronics and tape to make their highly original sounds, they eventually incorporated Funk, dance and Dub in the mix and released numerous singles, EPs and albums. Watson left the group in the early 80\u2032s to pursue a career in television and has since gained acclaim as an environmental sound recordist. Cabaret Voltaire\u2019s output slowed to a crawl in the Nineties and there has yet to be a proper CV recording in this century. Richard H. Kirk continues to put out releases under his own name, as Sandoz, Biochemical Dread and more. He has lately said in interviews that the last three or four Cabaret Voltaire albums were the work of himself alone., 76588=HOUR ONE: Easy Star All-Stars \u2013 With A Little Help From My Friends \u2013 Easy Star\u2019s Lonely Hearts Dub Band (Easy Star, 2009) **REQUEST The Special AKA \u2013 Racist Friend \u2013 In The Studio (Chrysalis, 1984) The Slits \u2013 Heard It Through The Grapevine \u2013 Cut 2009 Reissue (Universal, 1979) Tomata Du Plenty \u2013 Screamers Radio Spot \u2013 Yeti Issue #1 (self, 2000) The Screamers \u2013 If I Can\u2019t Have What I Want (I Don\u2019t Want Anything) \u2013 Live At The Mabuhay Gardens (boot, 1977) Echo & The Bunnymen \u2013 Over The Wall \u2013 Heaven Up Here (Sire, 1981), 78756=Devo \u2013 Don\u2019t Shoot (I\u2019m A Man) \u2013 Something For Everybody (Warner Bros, 2010) Eurythmics \u2013 Beethoven (I Love To Listen To) \u2013 Savage (Sony BMG, 1987) The Books \u2013 It\u2019s A Cold Freezing Night \u2013 The Way Out (Temporary Residence Ltd, 2010) Miranda July \u2013 How\u2019s My Driving \u2013 10 Million Hours A Mile (Kill Rock Stars, 1997), 73507=\u00a0On Monday Music, RaScHo plays music from twenty-two of the thirty-eight artists performing at 2010 Pickathon, 62661=With an incredible luck of the draw, with the Blues Festival moving the entire collective up one week in programming, I got the opportunity to do a show for Jerry Garcia's Birthday, which falls on the 1st of August. After a little bit of fun and frivolity, we finished some past buisness by playing the remainder of Madison Square Garden 09-09-91 SBD. At this point, we aired a beautiful \"Killer Audience Tape\" of The Jerry Garcia Band at The Orpheum Theater in Boston Ma. 12-02-77 Early Show. This has always been a favorite of mine. I was given a cassette copy of a bootleg album called \"The Grateful Dead Featuring Jerry Garcia Boston Ma. 12-02-77. (Bootleg albums were famous for not getting it right). This was a fine performance of a very up show! Content worthy of playing for everyone in the family! We were joined about midway through the program by Scotty Gillan from The Jerry Garcia Birthday Band to talk about Jerry's Birthday at The McMenamens Edgefield. This is where the J.G.B.B. got it's start, playing sets every year on Jerry's Birthday. Boy! What a fabulous weekend for DeadHeads! Saturday night at the Tonic Lounge, Tom Wright brought his Garcia cover\u00a0band \"Cats Down Under The Stars\" in for a Jerry Garcia Band hoedown!\u00a0(Tom also fronts \"Ramblin' Rose\",\u00a0the\u00a0Grateful Dead cover band). And then the Garcia Birthday thing at The Edgefield! (With The Freak Mountain Ramblers putting the cap on a perfect day!). Tom Chiles is taking a little time off to get some things taken care of, and we hope he will be back very soon! I'll be on the air again August 28th. Hmmmmm, what to play?}",
