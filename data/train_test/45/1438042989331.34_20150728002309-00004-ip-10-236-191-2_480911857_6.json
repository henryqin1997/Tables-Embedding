It will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that modifications to the described embodiments may be made. Therefore, the true scope of the present invention should be defined by the spirit of the attached claims. [0086] Since an algorithm for obtaining a weight with simple calculation is provided, a signal processing hardware module used in a mobile station can be simplified, thereby decreasing the manufacturing cost of mobile stations. When a digital signal processor (DSP) is used as signal processing hardware, general processing is possible so that a system can be configured with general software and hardware tools. Therefore, time to market can be decreased, and a low cost low power apparatus may be obtained. [0085] A weight of transmit diversity is obtained in a mobile station. By reducing the complexity of calculation performed in the mobile station, power loss resulting from the calculation can be reduced. The present invention minimizes the power loss of a mobile station by reducing the amount of calculation of weights in transmit diversity employed for improving the performance of the mobile station. [0084] In an optimum weight estimator of closed loop transmit diversity for mobile communication according to the present invention, calculation",
