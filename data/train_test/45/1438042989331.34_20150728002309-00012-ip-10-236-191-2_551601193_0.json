This metric provides a comparison of robustness in relation to other Lexmark printers and MFPs. 3\"Recommended Monthly Page Volume\" is a range of pages that helps customers evaluate Lexmark\u2019s product offerings based on the average number of pages customers plan to print on the device each month. Lexmark recommends that the number of pages per month be within the stated range for optimum device performance, based on factors including: supplies replacement intervals, paper loading intervals, speed, and typical customer usage. 2This product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit.
