The season's first three weeks include episodes originally announced as Season 4 episodes and were taped at South Point.[19][20], 5348=The program returned to American television over the NBC Sports Network on March 5, 2012 with previously aired repeats,[6] with unaired episodes from season 7 airing for the first time beginning June 4, 2012.[7] NBCSN schedules the show on weeknights at midnight, although the start time varies due to overruns by sporting events., 50260=Season 4 was taped in April 2008 at the South Point Casino in Las Vegas.[9] Season 4 episode titles and presumed seating order taken from NBC's Web site.[18], 14841=NBC abruptly stopped airing Poker After Dark on September 23, 2011,[11] a few days after Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, issued a statement alleging production underwriter Full Tilt Poker had perpetrated a Ponzi scheme on its customers. Replacing the show was a rebroadcast of the Hoda Kotb/Kathie Lee Gifford-hosted fourth hour of Today, and on the weekends, a second episode of In Wine Country from San Francisco Bay Area NBC station KNTV. NBC Sports has since removed their poker section entirely from their webpage, and previous episodes have been removed from Hulu. Although NBC did not issue a definitive statement regarding the schedule change or the future of the show, NBC Sports Senior Director of Communications Adam Freifeld has stated that NBC will \"continue to evaluate our poker programming.\"[12], 3692=Poker After Dark is an hour-long poker television program on NBC.[2] The show made its debut on January 1, 2007,[1] and was cancelled on September 23, 2011 following the \"Black Friday\" criminal case, which involved major sponsor Full Tilt Poker as one of the defendants.[3] For its first two seasons, both of which originally aired in 2007, the show was presented by Shana Hiatt.[4] The host for season 3 was Marianela Pereyra, and Leeann Tweeden took over starting with season 4.[5] All seasons have contained voice-over commentary by Oliver \"Ali\" Nejad., 12817=Poker After Dark aired six times a week, at 2:05\u00a0a.m. ET (1:05 CT) Tuesday through Saturday, and then at 1:00\u00a0a.m. ET (12:00 CT) on Sundays, though times vary according to the preferences of the affiliates.[10] The early Sunday show is a \"director's cut\" weekly summary of the previous week's shows., 19331=In France Poker After Dark airs at night on RTL9. In Germany, it airs on SPORT1, with commentary provided by Michael K\u00f6rner.[13] In Ireland, Poker After Dark airs on Setanta Ireland and Setanta Sports 1[14] on most weeknights with little change from the US version. In The Netherlands, it airs on Veronica; episodes feature the original English commentary with Dutch subtitles.[citation needed] In Sweden, Poker After Dark airs on afternoons and nights on TV4 Sport[citation needed] and on TV 10 weekday nights at 01:30.[citation needed] In Denmark, it airs at night on TV3+.[citation needed] In Italy, Poker After Dark airs at night on POKERItalia24.

Full Tilt Poker held promotional tournaments that offered a seat on the show as the grand prize. The first of these winners, Ken Light, appeared in the first week of Season 3, and was said[who?] to have picked his own opponents, though Light later said on the show itself that he was only asked to provide a list of his favorite players and that he did not know that players from the list would join him on the show.[4] Sponsorship[edit] In the U.S., the show had some early ratings success: during season one's second week, it attracted on average a larger audience among adults 18-34 than The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson did the same week,",
