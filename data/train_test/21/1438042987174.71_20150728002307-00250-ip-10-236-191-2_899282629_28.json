            "The campus police are really good at keeping students safe, but it's in a relatively bad area of Cleveland so every once in a while things do happen but students are almost never hurt in any way and the campus police do a good job following the cases up.",
            "The Greed Life here is great. I am in a fraternity and it is the best decision I have made. It is extremely helpful because you get academic help from older students and you have a better social life. Our Greek Life tends to do better, on average, than the non-Greek community academically. We also do a lot of community service. And we always have a great time no matter what we're doing.",
            "There are plenty of clubs to get involved in if you choose to involve yourself in one of them. There are a wide variety of them, so it's not difficult to find whatever you may want to.",
            "There isn't really anything that fits this description.",
            "There aren't really any of these, the only real tradition is students always study hard and they are always studying.",
            "It's really expensive, and there isn't a whole lot going on. But it is a good experience and it will get you prepared for a career or more education.",
            "There isn't a whole lot, but there will be events going on across campus every once in a while and there are people who throw parties in there dorms or apartments or suites throughout campus on Friday and Saturday nights which you can attend if you know the right people and choose to attend. Also there isn't much to do throughout Cleveland.",
            "The food in the dining halls really isn't that good at all, and it's very repetitive so it gets really old really fast.",
            "The dorm life is pretty mediocre, usually you ca find a good number of people in your building or in neighboring buildings who you connect with. So, making friends tends to not really be too hard.",
            "The academics here are really, really tough.",
            "Be prepared to study hard, even on a Friday or Saturday night. Be prepared to have to work hard to maintain a social life if you choose to have one.",
            "Case is a really tough academic school. There is relatively little social life that takes place on campus because people are forced to spend a lot of time studying. Campus life in general is pretty mediocre."

There is a pumpkin throwing every Halloween, Homecoming weekend is important, a campus wide service day every September or October, and the cycle club does free bike tune ups every fall, Hudson Relays, Halloween at Home, and study overs to name a few., 16625=This school is great for student who enjoy cold climates. Cleveland receives tons of snow from November to April. Students who are interested in Medicine, Art, Music, and Engineering will find a home at CWRU., 303729=I've only lived in freshman housing and then one of the nicest Greek houses on campus, so I can't speak for the sophomore or upperclassmen housing from experience. However, what I do know is that you are paying a lot of money for some ehhhhhh housing. Freshman dorms were pretty drab. Sophomore housing is in a suite style which is nice, but the singles are horrifically small and cramped. Maintenance is pretty unreliable; I had a friend whose heat went out in January, and it took two maintenance requests, two phone calls, and finally a visit to undergraduate services to have something done about it. And if you know anything about winter in Cleveland, you don't want your heat out for ten minutes, let alone three days. However, DON'T take that as a reason not to come here or to live on campus. The way the dorms are laid out makes it so easy to socialize with friends, especially in your first year. Laundry is FREE!!! Overall a positive experience that I have loved, especially being in my Greek house. Be sure to bundle up in the winter because it is about a 15 minute walk to the main quad from north side and 10 minutes from south side.}",

If you are content discussing pokemon and star trek for hours, then you will fit right in. If you want to party with friends, then you will also fit in. However, you might have to limit yourself to one night during the weekends, and do work during the other. Tips for prospective students Don't be afraid to check out Case Greek life. It doesn't fit the normal stereotype, and you will meet a lot of great friends. Go to the book swap",
