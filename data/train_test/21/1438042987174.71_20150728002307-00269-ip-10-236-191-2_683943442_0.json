Kerr, whose home is near Catonsville, in this county, was drowned Sunday in the Annapolis Harbor while rescuing his little son, who had fallen into the water.Mr. Kerr, with his wife and children and a party of friends had been on a cruise on Mr. Kerr's steam yacht, Watanga. Shortly after twelve o'clock Sunday the yacht made ready to leave Annapolis harbor, and as the beautiful craft drew away from her wharf the eight-year-old son of Mr. Kerr fell overboard. Instantly all was excitement on the yacht. Engineer Benton threw out a life-preserver to the little boy, but he failed to catch it. Mr. Kerr sprung into the water to save his son. Quickly the father caught his boy and held him above the water until a rescue boat arrived. Captain Burtis? and his son, who were on a wharf when young Kerr fell overboard, immediately leaped into a boat and headed for the child. Before Capt. Burtis reached the spot the father had sunk, and only the child was visible. Quickly the boy was taken into the little boat. In the meanwhile, the yacht had drifted away from the spot where Mr. Kerr had leaped overboard. Some one cried out to Capt. Burtis that Mr. Kerr was in the water. The Capt. was ignorant of this when he picked up the little boy. Every effort was made to find Mr. Kerr, but he never rose to the surface. The body was soon recovered by dragging. It was conveyed to the Burtis Wharf, and Dr. Washington C. Claude did all in his power to bring back life, and without success. Mr. Kerr's wife and five children were witnesses to the awful scene. Mr. Kerr was president of the Thistle Cotton Company, at Llchester??, Howard county. He had recently purchased the beautiful home of the late William Sinclair, near Catonsville. Mr. Kerr was an elder in the Presbyterian Church at Catonsville, to which he was a liberal contributor. The body was taken to North Carolina, his former home, for interment.",
