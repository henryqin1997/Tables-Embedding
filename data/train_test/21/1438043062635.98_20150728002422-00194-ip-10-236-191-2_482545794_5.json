Typical examples of the partially cross-linked vinyl chloride resin are products of Kanegafuchi Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. marketed under designations of XEL-A, XEL-B, XEL-C, XEL-D, and XEL-E, products of Chisso Corporation. marketed under designations of SD7E, SD10E, SD13E, CD18, CD18K, CD21, CD21K, CD25, and CD25 K, products of Shin-etsu Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. marketed under designations of GR-800S, GR-1300, GR-1300S, and GR-2500S, and products of Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals Co., Ltd. marketed under trademark designations of Vinycron DR-M and Vinycron DR-M-3., 43486=The method of this invention for the formation of the flexible vinyl chloride resin laminate 1 has been described above as effected by inflation molding. Also in the case of extrusion molding by the use of a T die or in the case of blow molding, a system similarly provided with two extrusion molding machines and a multi-layer die can be employed to obtain a flexible vinyl chloride laminate for forming the apparatus of this invention for medical treatment. In the flexible vinyl chloride resin laminate so obtained, the layer destined to constitute the inner wall of the medical instrument has a thickness in the range of 50 to 500 \u03bcm and the layer to constitute the outer layer has a thickness in the range of 500 to 50 \u03bcm. The ratio in thickness of the layer for the inner wall to the layer for the outer wall falls in the range of 1:1 to 1:10. On the inner wall surface are formed minute protuberances and depressions. The average of heights from tops to bottoms of the protuberances and depressions, namely the average height of the protuberances and depressions, falls in the range of 1 to 45 \u03bcm. When the flexible vinyl chloride resin forming the outer wall contains cross-linked vinyl chloride resin particles in less than 1.5% by weight, the outer wall surface also contains minute protuberances and depressions., 25973=This invention contemplates providing a medical instrument the outer wall of which is formed of a layer of flexible vinyl chloride resin containing cross-linked vinyl chloride resin particles in a concentration of less than 1.5% by weight. This invention also contemplates providing a medical instrument wherein the flexible vinyl chloride resin composition forming the inner wall of the apparatus contains the cross-linked vinyl chloride resin particles in a concentration in the range of 1.5 to 60% by weight, preferably 2 to 30% by weight, based on the total amount of vinyl chloride resin in the flexible vinyl chloride resin composition. This invention further contemplates providing a medical instrument wherein the cross-linked vinyl chloride resin particles are insoluble in tetrahydrofuran (THF). This invention contemplates providing a medical instrument wherein the cross-linked vinyl chloride resin particles have an average particle diameter in the range of 0.5 to 150 \u03bcm. Then, the present invention contemplates providing a medical instrument wherein the inner wall has a thickness in the range of about 50 to 500 \u03bcm, the outer wall has a thickness in the range of about 50 to 500 \u03bcm, and the ratio of the thickness of the inner wall to that of the outer wall is in the range of 1:1 to 1:10. Further, the present invention contemplates providing a medical instrument wherein the average height of minute protuberances and depressions in the inner wall surface is in the range of 1 to 45 \u03bcm. This invention further contemplates providing a medical instrument wherein fine protuberances and depressions are also formed in the surface of the outer wall. The present invention also contemplates providing a medical instrument wherein the outer wall contain cross-linked vinyl chloride particles in a concentration of not less than 0.01% by weight and less than 1.5% by weight.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patentzitate The medical instrument according to this invention offers still better performance when the outer wall thereof is made of the flexible vinyl chloride resin composition containing less than 1.5% by weight of the cross-linked vinyl chloride resin, because the instrument is then free from the otherwise possible blocking between the opposed outer surfaces of two adjoining apparatuses. As described above, the medical instrument according to the present invention is an apparatus formed of a flexible vinyl chloride resin wall and therefore enabled to be flattened, which apparatus is characterized by the fact that the inner wall thereof whose opposed surfaces come into mutual contact when the apparatus is flattened is formed of a flexible vinyl chloride resin composition containing cross-linked vinyl chloride resin particles and, consequently, minute protuberances and depressions are formed in the aforementioned opposed surfaces of the inner wall. Thus, the opposed surfaces of the inner wall of the instrument are embossed and the possible blocking between the opposed inner surfaces of the instrument is precluded in spite of the fact that the apparatus is made of flexible vinyl chloride. This instrument, therefore, can be esily opened at the mouth and the entry of transfusion fluid, blood, etc. to the interior of the instrument can be attained smoothly. Since the instrument of this invention can have the inner surfaces thereof uniformly and easily embossed without necessitating any special device such as an embossing roll, it",
