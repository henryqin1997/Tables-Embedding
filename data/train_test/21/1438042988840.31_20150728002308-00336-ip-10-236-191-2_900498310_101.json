            "Safety is absolutely wonderful. We all get alerts to our cellphones if anything happens on or off campus and if you need to get somewhere and for whatever reason, you can't walk or its too late, they pick you up.",
            "Student Productions is definitely one of the best clubs you can join if you really want to get involved. They have separate committees for music, film, recreation, special events and marketing. You can join as many committees as you'd like as long as the schedules don't clash. They are basically in charge of putting together different events on campus from concerts to movies nights to homecoming week,",
            "There is a museum on campus we get to go in for a free and a couple others down the block. The school also has a park on campus which is great when you want to de-stress. Ybor City is also a few minutes away and there is tons of entertainment there. Being in the heart of Tampa means there a lot shopping malls within ten or 15 minutes.",
            "There could be more diversity but the places already set have amazing food and being in walking distance of downtown you can always grab something different.",
            "The housing is great. I prefer staying at the hotel because the rooms and beds are bigger even though we have to take a shuttle to campus or walk but if you don't mind downsizing stay on campus would be great too. Each option has its pros and cons.",
            "All of the classes I've taken have definitely been a challenge although the ones I found more interesting were a bit easier.",
            "Apply to as many scholarships as you can definitely. Check out the campus and see if it's for you, it isn't huge but it is beautiful.",
            "The University of Tampa has an extremely diverse student body. Class sizes are relatively small giving us an opportunity to develop relationships with our professors that help us academically, professionally, and in life. There are an immense number of resources available to us from counseling to career service."

May be pricey, but well worth the costs., 442214=UT students always participate in the Gasparilla parade that takes place mid-January. It is a great experience, a lot like mardi gras, and a great way to let loosen up a bit half way through the school year., 36862=This university is great for kids who like a more one on one learning experience and like to get to know a variety of different people from a variety of different places, we have over 1000 international students! If you don't wanna take a twenty minute walk to your classes, get to know a lot of people, and have your teacher know who you are The University of Tampa is right for you!, 500214=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 143323=Gasparilla. Every year in January the city of Tampa shuts down its main roads for what is essentially a pirate-themed Mardi Gras. The residence assistants will cook breakfast for each student in their hall and the students start drinking as early as 7am. Then we walk around the city watching the parade and seeing thousands of people. Best time of my life., 114690=The dorms are pretty good except really for Mckay. But, the school keeps accepting way more students than they have room for so some students are put in a hotel off campus but there is a shuttle to get to and from campus. A new dorm is underway and should be up in 2013., 324775=There is an annual event that happens in late January, right after you come back from winter break called Gasparilla, AKA Gatsby. Everybody wakes up at 9 am, puts on a pirate costume, gets drunk, and walks the streets of Tampa. This event is actually a lot of fun and sponsored by the city, there's a huge pirate parade and the pirates give away beads in the parade. It is complete madness and a nightmare if you decide to drive that day, but its ALWAYS better on foot if you're going to be drinking!! But if you're more of a wallflower, its pretty easy to opt out, there's no pressure to party, but a lot of people do. Tampa is actually on a river that is within a park so you can walk up to the river, lay out a towel and sunbathe, study, or take in the view. Its a really beautiful place to just sit and relax. Another cool thing was that we had the Republican National Debate come to UT this last Fall of 2012! We had the Today Show come and visit the campus as well as Senator John McCain stopped by to speak to our business students., 315565=I have heard great things from this school. I am planning to apply in the Fall of 2013. Is a beautiful campus and I hope to visit the campus soon!}",

    "textAfterTable": "The environment is great and the location is very nice. The whole campus makes you feel like you're at home. Am learning a lot Since the class sizes are so small, the professors are able to focus more on the individual students and therefore make sure that you do learn and pass the class.

We have so much here on campus all withing walking distance, you don't have to ride a bike to get from building to building. It's also a great school if you live in Florida as I do, you can live on campus and have the independence,",
