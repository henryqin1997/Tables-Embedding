Examples: We do not return errors if you supply invalid filter parameters or values (invalid filter parameter/value pairs will just have no effect). One exception to the rule above: if you provide the filter_status parameter with the value \"all\" then you will override all other filters and all items will be returned. Filters are \"AND-ed\" together. For example, if you supply GET parameters of \"filter_status=incomplete&filter_date_completed=1d\" then you end up with no items returned. This is because there are no items that are incomplete AND completed less than a day ago. Important Notes: filter_priority=1+ filters for items with a priority of 1 or more (stars) (so, it matches priorities 1, 2 and 3) filter_priority=2 filters for items with a priority of exactly",
