Complex and time-consuming acquisition and configuration, as well as training in use of the computer components becomes unnecessary with the present device. While the above is a complete description of the preferred embodiments of the invention, various alternatives, modifications, and equivalents may be used. Therefore, the above description should not be taken as limiting the scope of the invention which is defined by the appended claims. The configuration of the preferred embodiment of the present invention does not limit itself solely to accessing and receiving requested information. The present invention is able to access remote facilities and initiate desired activities on behalf of the user using the electronic device. The present invention includes an ability to store profile information relating to the user, such as cable service provider, etc. and initiate calls, at the users behalf, to authorize the cable service provider to provide \"pay-per-view\" service or interactive television, for example. By using the credit card reader, or credit card information stored in the memory 102, the electronic device may quickly provide access and authorization for particular events the user desires. In this fashion, the electronic device 20 provides a simple interface to the electronic networks available to conventional computer users, without the expense and complexity of learning to operate a",
