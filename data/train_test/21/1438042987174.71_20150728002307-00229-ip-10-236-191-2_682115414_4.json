Thoughts on the nature of the institution from a new Assistant Professor of Physics. I'm not sure about the \"healthy tension,\" but then I'm a cynical old Professor of Humanities. Actually, I'm linking to this because it plays into my still-developing ideas about academic honesty. Besides, how can you argue with this kind of idealism? Being fifty (two) ain't so bad, though. Maybe because I've spent my life in the university? Posted by Joseph Duemer at 5:27 AM. Walt Whitman, born May 31, 1819, pictured at about the age I am now, by the look of him.

Friday, May 02, 2003 Something is screwy about HG's permalinks, but he mentions (in his 5.2.03, 8:06 a.m. post) my way of thinking about the recent war. Henry is contrasting my anti-war stance to that of a number of other poets on the left. Like Henry, I have a visceral aversion to cant whether it comes from the left or right; but I'm not quite so ready to condemn my fellow leftist & anti-war poets as Henry. Not that he doesn't have a point--there was a moralistic streak in some of the statements from the anti-war literati during the run-up to the war.
