This time Murphy scored the opener before DJ Campbell sealed the victory and he was delighted for everyone connected with the club. He told the official website: 'It`s a real feeling of joy more than anything to get that first home win. \"We`ve been waiting a long time for that, especially at home and I thought we deserved the win today and that a draw would have been a little harsh on us, considering the way we`ve played. \"There was a real sense that we weren`t going to lose today. In recent games we`ve conceded late goals but today I thought we showed a lot of character and fully deserved the three points.\" More like that from Murphy and co and we will soon be out of the bottom three., 8863=Tractor Boys Are Up And Running Again!
