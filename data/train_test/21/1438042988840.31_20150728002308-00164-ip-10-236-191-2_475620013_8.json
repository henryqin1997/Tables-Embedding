The shade is made of spring steel or equivalent material and is adapted to be affixed to cover the seat portion of a lounge chair. The shade is unfolded under the force of the compressed spring and attached to the chair to provide shade over the seat of the chair. A disadvantage of the device of this patent is that the flexible sheet, irrespective of whether it is made of metal or plastic, cannot be folded and occupies a large area in storage. The sheet has to be sufficiently large in order to be above the head of the chair's occupant when used. Furthermore, the flexible sheet is normally separated from the chair and can be misplaced in storage., 18075=Heretofore, many proposals have been made aimed at providing beach chairs with sun-protective means. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,135,281 issued in 1992 to E. Pappalardo, relates to chair sun shades, especially to chair sun shades that are collapsible and detachable from the frame, made of a disposable, replaceable, and imprintable type of material. The device consists of two plastic strips attached by their base ends to the vertical frame supports on the back of a chair with hook-and-loop fastener strips known under the Velcro trademark. The strips, which are flexible, support a sun-shade material, e.g., a fabric or a plastic film. Connected to the distal ends of the plastic strips are cords. When the opposite ends of the cords are attached to the back of the seat, the plastic films are bent in such a manner that they form an arch-shaped canopy above the chair seat and hence above the chair's occupant. A disadvantage of the device of U.S. Pat. No. 5,135,281 is that the sun-shading attachment normally is not permanently attached to the chair and can be separated from the chair and stored in a different place or misplaced and not always found when needed. U.S. Pat. No. 6,234,187 issued in 2001 to L. Izzo discloses an adjustable umbrella apparatus comprising an umbrella with a canopy and a rod. A connector is attached to the rod and has a pair of prongs extending therefrom. The connector is disposed within a channel formed in an umbrella base. The connector prongs are spring-loaded relative to the connector body within the channel and, when released, the prongs are urged through corresponding lock holes to retain the umbrella in a desired position relative to the umbrella base. When the spring-loaded prongs are compressed, the connector may be slid within the channel longitudinally or rotatably relative to the longitudinal axis of the channel. In this manner, the umbrella can be adjusted longitudinally and rotatably to a chosen orientation and held securely in place in that chosen orientation. The umbrella base is formed integral with or attachable to a framed chair such as a beach chair. The umbrella of U.S. Pat. No. 6,234,187 entails the same disadvantages as the device of the previous U.S. patent.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets Although the invention has been shown and described with reference to specific embodiments, it is understood that these embodiments should not be construed as limiting the areas of application of the invention and that any changes and modifications are possible, provided these changes and modifications do not depart from the scope of the attached patent claims. For example, the chair is not necessarily foldable and may have any other suitable construction. The chair may comprise a chaise longue. The rods 32 a 1, 32 a 2, and 32 b 1, and 32 b 2 can extend automatically under the effect of springs located in the tubular frame elements 28 b and 28 d. The retractable strips 40 and 42 can automatically extend from the armrests 28 e and 28 f under the effect of springs. The term \u201ccord\u201d used in the specification may mean a string, wire, thread, etc. The chair can be conveniently stored and carried out together with the sun-shading device which has a very light weight and, when not in use, is completely hidden inside the frame elements of the chair. Thus, it has been shown that the invention provides a chair equipped with a simple, foldable, and lightweight sun-shading device that is integrally connected with or built into the chair and, when not in use, is hidden inside the body of the chair. The aforementioned device can be",
