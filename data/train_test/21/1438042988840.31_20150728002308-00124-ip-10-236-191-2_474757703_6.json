The top-to-bottom field change occurs when the five line counter reaches the count of 5 following receipt of the next vertical synchronization signal. As illustrated, FIGS. 5a and 5b, since there are 2621/2 lines per field, the next vertical synchronization signal will be received on count 21/2 of the five line counter. The count of 5, i.e. the indicated start of bottom field, will take place 21/2 counts later. Since the desired offset between top and bottom field is 1/2 a horizontal line for the main channel and 11/2 horizontal lines for the PIP channel, a one or two line correction is required. How this is achieved will be explained during the description of the operation and construction of the field generator and top line counter below.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention has been illustrated in a preferred embodiment, it is not to be limited thereto. Other embodiments will be obvious to one skilled in the art and are intended to be encompassed by the following claims. In addition, the initiation of only one of the fields, here the top field, is dependent on the relative timing of the horizontal and vertical synchronization signals. Artifacts resulting from incorrect interlace due to crossing of the vertical over the horizontal synchronization signal are thus minimized. It is evident from the above descriptions that the field generator of the present invention provides a simple way to process an incoming interlaced signal to preserve the correct spatial and temporal relationship between the two fields without requiring a predetermined one of the fields to be top field and the other to be bottom field. Either field can be top or bottom field. The main difference between the embodiment of FIG. 9 and that of FIG. 7 is in the timing of the first selector signal, namely initiation of the toggling of flip-flop 80 and 82 during top field. In the embodiment of FIG. 7, the change in the flip-flop is triggered by the horizontal synchronization signal immediately following the vertical synchronization signal. In FIG. 9, triggering of flip-flop 82 is delayed by two counts by means of flip-flops 90 and 91. The top-to-bottom and bottom-to-top transitions of flip-flop 82 will",
