    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{851784=The rigor of the academics depends on the college and program that you are enrolled in. Many courses on campus are graded through multiple choice exams, especially entry-level or 1000 level courses. This excludes examinations in quantitative (Q) classes and writing (W) classes. You have to study to succeed. It is not necessary to study your notes every day (for most courses at least), but allow one must allow themselves plenty of time before exams to review material. Two days of studying is not going to earn the average student an A., 404431=The woods have trails that lead to interesting things. The best tradition was Spring Weekend. It's a big block party at Carriage on Thursday, one in Celeron on Friday and another in X-lot on Saturday. This is usually done on the last weekend before the last week of class. It has been suspended by the administration but it will resurface this 2012-13 year. Learn the UConn chants at football and basketball games. Attend Late-Night at least once. Go to Horsebarn Hill to hang out and watch a beautiful sunrise or sunset., 834708=UConn is a large school with a lot of options and possibilities for all their students. Although it is located in a rural area, almost everything a student may need is within walking distance either on campus or in the newly built Storrs Center. Not only is it an academically competitive school, but, don't forget, we are also the 2014 dual champions for college basketball!, 406752=South Dining Hall is the best. Towers is really good and has Kosher and Halal. The North and Northwest Dining Halls are good and have a good stir fry bar. East is not bad and Putnam is mediocre. McMahon is good from 7:30PM to 10PM. I like to research the menu so I know where to eat. On days when there is Pasta Bar or Stir Fry Bar, get there early because the lines will be huge this year!, 866248=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 73686=Depends where you are. West campus? Not so great. South Campus? Pretty amazing, but unless you are a senior or junior, it's hard to get a room there, and they cost more. It also stinks because housing went up for the 2012-2013 school year. Off campus housing is available also, but a lot of the places near campus are sometimes the party central of the weekends, so you have to be careful with that if it isn't your thing, 758562=Some schools only require 2 continuous years of highschool language but Uconn requires 3 so make sure you come in with that otherwise you'll be taking 2 semesters here. If you have to take Chemistry 1127 I recommend taking it at one of the community colleges instead of here since their program isn't known to be too good. The professors are willing to help if you go to them but it's a really tough course. The best way to get your questions answered is to talk to students. They offer the best insight on what classes to take, how to organize your schedule, which dining halls are the best, etc. etc. The advisors and faculty will try to help but because it's such a big school there's a lot of bureaucracy and oftentimes you'll be told by one department to talk to another department which will then direct you to another department - so on and so forth. And if a student doesn't know the answer to a question you have they'll be able to easily direct you to the best person to answer your question. Students know the most :), 393713=There are many challenging classes for one biology 1107., 263407=UConn has over 300 clubs and societies on and off campus. UConn often hosts concerts, comedy shows, and other extraordinary performances at Jorgensen center for the performing arts, which are always enjoyable. On top of that, UConn has a world renown sporting program, which includes the 2011 NCAA National Champion Basketball team. Attending games are a campus favorite, and always offer a great time., 180938=I just received my Financial Aid and am thankful that my fee bill is under 2000 per term(Commuting to West Hartford branch)! I am excited to go to UConn with a little bit of cash left in my pocket!, 757552=Uconn is academically strong. I'm an engineering major so the subjects are fairly difficult but they're not impossible. I get the feeling that all the faculty really want to help the students so talk to them if you have any questions on the material! They will be willing to work with you but you have to make yourself known since the freshmen classes are so large. Don't expect too personal of an academic experience with your professors though unless you're talking to them all the time. Most of them will have over 1000 students (not in one lecture but over a few lectures) which is a downside of the school. The TAs are excellent though. You can get to know them better if your class has a discussion since discussions are generally capped at a max of 30 students. (Most discussions I'm in have no more than 20), 754766=Not super but not awful. For me it was either pay for a dorm room or pay for a car and live 20 minutes away at home. Having a car is a real hassle on campus and I don't recommend it because it's such a nightmare to drive around and find parking. If you're a commuter you have to park far away in one of the outer lots and if you're a resident student you need 54 credits to have a car on campus anyways. The dorm staff does an excellent job of keeping the bathrooms and common areas clean and tidy. There are certain points of the day where things are less-than-neat but that's to be expected somewhat in a college dorm. The rooms are decently sized - I believe they're actually slightly larger than an average dorm room. Depending on where you're housed your room will be different. Most freshmen are housed in the Northwest Quad but you can be put anywhere if you select random for your housing. For the most part the other students are respectful of quiet hours and whatnot. It is a college dorm though so there are points where people are being rambunctious. The RAs do a good job keeping up-to-date information and are very realistic in their expectations. They're not out to get you which is a plus. There's no air-conditioning when it gets super hot though (this can happen in September sometimes, it IS New England) and they don't generally turn on the heat until mid-November. They do have AC in the bathrooms and common rooms - same with the heat. A good window fan is recommended as well as a couple others to keep air flowing. I'm pretty sure heaters are not allowed so bring a lot of blankets and sweaters if you're the type who hates cold/gets cold easily. Mini-fridge is also a good idea but only 1 per room so make sure you coordinate with your roommate(s) as to who will bring it. There's a height restriction of 32 but not too big of a deal since most mini-fridges are smaller than that anyways. You can rent one from the university if no one brings one. Rooms are generally doubles and there are never forced triples or quads (rooms that were doubles being used for 3 people) You can get into a triple or quad if you want to and if you're a freshman and they run out of housing you might get placed in a triple/quad even if you designated that you wanted a double. It doesn't happen too often though and I don't actually know anyone that it's happened to but it's a possibility. Filling out the housing application and returning the deposit as soon as possible is a good idea., 95228=The Parade-Parade along with Homecoming in October when there's a king and a queen chosen., 591956=2013 was the first year for the underwear mile run, they have an oozeball tournament every year, it is mud volleyball basically., 494101=The food isn't all too great. There are lots of dining hall options based on location, however you need to find the one you like best. On the down side most of them have weird hours (Towers Dining Hall closes at 7:15, where others are open until 10. Also they open at 10am on weekends and I find myself starving to death if I wake up early). Get a good meal plan, because the places that require Husky Bucks and Points happen to be the better food options, and they're super convenient to have in the Union.}",

    "textAfterTable": "M from Storrs, CT 10/17/2010 Reviewer is A current student here. 12 out of 13 people found this review useful. 2 of 184 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Social, outgoing students will feel perfectly at home here. Those who tend to be a bit shy will also bloom and grow to be more assertive once they find their niche. Everyone in UConn finds something or other that they are passionate about, and students often make the best of friends from sharing similar interests, classes, or even living in the same residence hall. Also, those who are academically serious and like to challenge themselves should come here, since the courses at UConn are very different from what students in high school are accustomed to. Tips for prospective students Personally, being in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences allows me to be flexible in what classes I take. I can switch majors depending on what classes I have taken and not have to worry about wasting my time taking a certain class not within my major. Don't expect UConn to be a party school",
