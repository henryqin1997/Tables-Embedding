Hardened alloy steel load chain with embossed identification, marked as to the relevant standards. Easy two-step operation to prevent accidental free-wheeling. The unique design of the bottom hook prevents slipping and ensures safe operation. Vital lever blocks can be supplied with overload protection for added security of use (excluding 250kg and 500kg models). All Vital models are manufactured to comply with AS1418.2. Manufactured in Japan using optimum high quality steel which conforms to the strict JIS & ISO regulations. The VR-series lever blocks feature a \u201clock-in and lock-out\u201d braking system which is the more traditional style with a free-wheeling system requiring the disengagement of the gear drive mechanism which is impossible with any load suspended on it.
