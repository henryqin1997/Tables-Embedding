In this manner, the image boundaries are approximated., 57981=In step 1014, all brightness peaks along a vertical line are located and recorded. The recordation includes recording the pixels associated with the brightness peaks., 57052=In step 1004, a digital enhancement is performed on the image. In the preferred embodiment, the digital enhancement method looks at a single vertical scan of pixels that cuts across the lines of the image. A maximum and minimum brightness is found, and a local scale is defined, with the scale being 255 for the maximum brightness, and 0 for the minimum. Then pixels within the image that do not exceed a predetermined brightness threshold are set to zero, while pixels that do exceed the predetermined brightness threshold are set to a value of 255. It should be understood that other enhancement methods may be used, such as standard image enhancement routines commonly used in the art., 58174=In step 1019, the vertical line and the associated brightness peaks are rejected if less than a predetermined number of such peaks are found. This step ensures that areas having drop-offs or blank spots in the image do not adversely affect the final result., 58794=In step 1027, the image lines are converted into physical dimensions by applying a scaling factor. In the preferred embodiment, each pixel represents about 0.3 millimeter., 58992=In step 1031, a geometric conversion is applied in order to determine the contour heights of the facial area. The height determination is performed in accordance with the formula discussed in conjunction with FIG. 5 above., 58458=In step 1025, the finding process of step 1014 is repeated a predetermined number of times. The number of vertical lines thereby inspected will control the accuracy and resolution of the method.
