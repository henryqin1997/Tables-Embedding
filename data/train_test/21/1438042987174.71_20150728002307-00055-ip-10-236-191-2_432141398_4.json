A whirlwind century for England Lions against the New Zealand tourists even brought loose talk of a Test debut. Instead, he was selected in the ODI team at The Oval later that summer, hitting 50 on debut against India although he drifted out of the one-day set-up following the 2011 World Cup with his bowling never quite strong enough to hold down a fifth bowler's spot. He careered up and down the batting order more than was good for him., 37006=That Test debut was never closer than when Andrew Flintoff retired from Test cricket after the 2009 Ashes series. He was called up to England's Test squad for the first time for the winter tour of South Africa. Geoff Miller, England's chairman of selectors, remarked: \"The retirement of Andrew Flintoff has created a vacancy for an allrounder\u2026 we believe Luke can make an impact at Test level.\" Wright was expected to play in the first Test, but England decided upon a policy of six specialist batsmen., 68633=Since the beginning of 2012, Ian Bell averages 34.69 when batting in the top six; among regular top-order batsmen, only Shane Watson has a lower average, 39559=He has also been in demand around the world for domestic T20 tournaments, playing for Melbourne Stars in Australia's Big Bash and Pune Warriors at the IPL. A sparkling 44-ball hundred against Hobart Hurricanes in the inaugural Big Bash League in 2011-12 was the fastest at that point in Australia's domestic competition. England's reversal of their international calendar in 2014, with the season beginning with one-day cricket, did not promote his cause at the IPL, where he did not attract a bid and, consigned once more to the start of a Championship season at Sussex, described his fate as \"woolly hat time.\", 44576=Apr 8, 2015, 38756=Wright performed admirably in England's World Twenty20-winning team in 2010. He contributed 90 runs in significant circumstances during England's successful campaign, and though he bowled only one over in the tournament, it was a pivotal one - he got rid of the in-form Cameron White in the final against Australia. He was also one of England's most combative performers in a less impressive campaign in Sri Lanka in 2012, his unbeaten 99 against Afghanistan in Colombo coming desperately close to making him the first England batsman to hit a T20 hundred. An injury ruled him out of the 2014 event in Bangladesh and when he was quietly omitted from England's squads at the start of Peter Moores' second term in charge his international prospects looked bleak., 46508=NBC Denis Compton Award 2005, 46569=NBC Denis Compton Award 2007, 46447=NBC Denis Compton Award 2004, 37561=Wright represented England Under-19s, won the Denis Compton medal four times and scored a century on his Championship debut for Sussex. He spent two winters at the National Academy based at Loughborough University, where he was right at home having studied Sports Science and Sports Massage there. He was also a key part of the Sussex team that won the C&G Trophy in 2006. The following year he smashed his maiden domestic Twenty20 Cup century, scoring 103 from only 45 balls against Kent at Canterbury. Although Sussex were defeated in the semi-finals, Wright finished as the highest run scorer in the competition with 346 runs., 64555=4391 runs after 35, and 2354 outside top five}",
