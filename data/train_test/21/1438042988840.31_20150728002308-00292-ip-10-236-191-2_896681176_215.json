            "I have never felt unsafe. I always see campus safety trucks driving around. There are emergency poles all over campus. If you feel unsafe walking at night you can call the campus security to give you a ride.",
            "I've heard it's a lot of fun. Just know if you join you will be very busy! It's an easy way to make friends. I plan on rushing next year to try it out. Frats throw parties almost every weekend. Thursday night is the unusual CSUF party night because not a lot of people have Friday classes.",
            "Lots of clubs! I haven't found any I want to join, but there are so many. They have a couple days each semester where all the clubs put up a booth and give out information on them.",
            "Everybody. Very diverse campus. It has great business and nursing programs that are pretty competitive, but definitely worth it.",
            "This school is cheaper than UC schools and some CSU schools. I don't feel like my education is suffering because I'm not going to a UC. I believe I am getting a quality education for a pretty good price.",
            "Hang out with people on your floor! There is a Hookah Lounge nearby. A mall about 6 minutes away. Get a Disneyland pass and take the bus there! Bus passes are free as a student and you can get discounted Disneyland tickets or passes. Go to Downtown Fullerton and walk around or see a movie. Purchase discount movie tickets in the TSU.",
            "The gastranome is where everyone who lives on campus eats. If you live in the Res Halls it is required to purchase a meal plan. It is buffet style. The food is okay; some days are better than others. The chocolate chip cookies are the most popular item. In the TSU there are other places to eat, which is where most of the commuters go. There is a Round Table, Panda Express, Starbucks, Juice-It-Up, and more.",
            "It's so fun! If you choose to live on campus you will live in the Residence Halls freshman year. I'm so glad I did. You meet so many interesting people. I've made some great friends. These people get to know you so well because you all are living together and are going through this life transition in the same way.",
            "All my professors are extremely knowledgeable. This school has an Honors program and a Presidential Scholars program. Honors classes are smaller, so you get to know both the students and professor much better. I'm in the honors program and it was probably the best decision I made after I chose this school. I already feel like I have learned a lot and am getting a great education.",
            "Look up if this school has a good program for whatever field you are interested in. Take into consideration of you are commuting or living on campus. There are a lot of commuters, so parking is difficult to find. The dorms are great, my only complaint is the slow elevators.",
            "This school is relatively small, but I like it because I can get to all of my classes quickly. It is very diverse and a majority of the students are friendly and very interested in learning. Housing on campus is great and the dorm rooms are much larger compared to most other schools I know of."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{966479=Many on campus places are good and there is nice variety on and off campus, but i must give this category two stars for unresolved issue that affects the students. The eatery that the campus requires students that dorm to eat at is called the Gastronome. The Gastronome currently has a food safety rating of a D and has had this rating since July of 2013. Making it mandatory to purchase a meal plan to at a facility that D is quite unacceptable., 312126=I'm not a student yet until the fall of 2012, but from what I've heard Cal State Fullerton's standards seems to be at a high level., 246244=Overall, I feel safe on this campus. We have campus police that patrols the campus. I can walk around at 3 o'clock in the morning and still feel safe., 419338=I have been accepted to California State University of Fullerton and plan on attending this fall of 2012. I have heard wonderful things about this campus and have had a great experiences with guidance from the counselors at the school so far! I will be majoring in Kinesiology and am excited because I heard they have an outstanding Kinesiology program at CSUF!, 719207=Get to school before 9:00 if you want to park., 279892=I have never lived on campus but I have friends who have. They say it is a great way to be more involved in school. Since this is a commuter school, those who live in the dorms have more chances of being more involved. New dorms opened in 2011-2012 term., 140352=I can't complain about a whole lot. Parking permits are $220 a semester, and trying to find a parking spot anywhere between 8:30-12:45 is a nightmare, good luck! I did get most of the classes that I wanted for the spring semester, except they are all at undesirable times. I can't wait to get priority registration; getting all of my classes will be a breeze! :), 49252=CSUF is fairly cheap compared to other schools. The state budget crisis for the 2009-2010 school year has however made the cost rise. Although it has been hectic registering for classes as well as paying for classes this year, I still feel like the education at this school is worth the money. Some people go to community colleges before a university, but I personally think that holds students back and it usually takes them 5 years to graduate. Going to CSUF straight out of high school is definitely worth the money., 465367=California State University, Fullerton is a very cozy campus with everything the college student needs. The student-professor ratio (in my classes) is about 24:1, which is excellent for those who need easier access to their professor. There is a variety of places to study on campus and as well as places to relax after a stressful day at in class., 368412=I believe the campus safety to be pretty good. I take at least one night class a semester and haven't felt unsafe walking a few blocks to my car between 9:30 and 10:00 at night., 805026=The underdog of the california colleges. May not be our first choices at first, but it is the right choice in the end., 337240=I have never dormed at Fullerton, but, I am considering this Fall 2012. Especially because I live a little far from the campus. But, I believe it will be worthed., 736044=A campus tradition is that during finals or tests, if you rub the fallen Statue of David's butt cheek you'll get good luck haha. I've done it and I got an A! Also there's snow day, in October they bring snow into the quad and you can go sledding. There's also the annual spring concert in may, last year we had Mike Posner and Hunter Hayes., 607466=Cal State Fullerton is the perfect school if you want to get involved. May your intentions be for social and friendships or if you want to volunteer or advocate., 1130577=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 643863=This school is expensive. The parking pass for one semester is $220. Tuition fees usually increase every semester and have doubled since I started in 2007., 697434=AMAZING! They just completed a new set of dorms in 2010 and they are beautiful and modern. The community is unrivaled. I met countless life long friends there and even my husband!, 660772=When I visited California State University, Fullerton in September 2012, I knew that I wanted this to be my future school. The resources that the schools provides to its students drew me in. I love the history of the campus, as well as its surroundings., 5103=Sign up for a Freshman Program after you get accepted, because you will receive priority registration for your first semester and help you adjust better your first semester because you are enrolled in a University 100 class with helpful professors, mentors, and CSUF staff. Sign up for the Finish in Four program around October of your first semester because that enables you to have priority registration during your 4 years at this institution. Having priority registration is a big deal because it's very difficult to get the classes you need with the budget cuts (they cut lots of classes). Also, look your professors up on RateMyProfessor.com because having a good professor makes a BIG difference., 660157=Unsure yet, but I will be living in the apartments on campus beginning in January 2013., 947501=My first semester as a returning transfer student at Cal State Fullerton was more than I could have asked for. I first attended CSUF as a freshman in 2006 and did not apply myself. This time I felt as though a new world of education had been opened up to me and I love it!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here Cal State University, Fullerton is a commuter school, therefore most of the students in class are there to get it done with so they can go home. There isn't much of a social aspect here and it's difficult to meet new friends. The school has apartment-style dorms that house only 800 students, which is only 2% of the student population. There are much more students that live off campus, but they are dispersed throughout the city. Meeting people in class is difficult and you have to make an effort to meet people- check out the clubs and student organizations on campus at the DiscoverFest held in the quad at the beginning of the semester, it will make your experience here more enjoyable. Am learning a lot The classes at Cal State University, Fullerton are fairly easy. I had expected college to be a lot more difficult, but CSUF has proved otherwise. Although the classes are not difficult, they have allowed me to grow intellectually. The professors don't necessarily assign huge work loads, instead they assign assignments and projects that are relevant to the class and real life. The professors help you develop your critical thinking skills by opening your eyes to seeing things from different perspectives by encouraging classroom and group discussions. Many of the professors have unique teaching styles",
