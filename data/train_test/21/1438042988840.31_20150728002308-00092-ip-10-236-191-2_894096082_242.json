            "During the first semester of my college experience (fall 2013), there was a lot of crime that happened. As of now, they have increased the police patrol and protection by almost double so there hasnt been any crime reports in the past month or so. The police do not care if you are underage and drunk. The only way you can get a minor is if you're either passed out on the sidewalk, walking alone stumbling or showing signs of intoxication, or throwing up on the sidewalk. Other than that, the police do not care that you've been drinking because they have a lot more serious problems to look for (robberies, drug dealers, ect.). They just want to make sure you can get home safely. Also, there is a Gopher Chauffeur that will pick you up from anywhere on campus and drop you off at your house free of charge. So if you're at a party that's far from your house and you're drunk, call the Gopher Chauffeur for a free sober cab!",
            "I joined a fraternity the first semester of my freshman year and I had a blast! I made a ton of new friends and was always the go to guy for parties on my dorm floor. Greek life is an experience of a life time and encourage everyone to at least check it out! Also, frat row is a pretty awesome sight if I do say so myself.",
            "The U of M offers intramural sports for just about every sport you can think of. From broom ball, flag football, and ultimate frisbee, they have it all!",
            "There are staircases right outside of Pioneer Hall (in the super block) that leads down to the river. This is a great place to go when you want to take a walk and think.",
            "There is a sand volleyball court in the middle of the super block, along with two basketball courts. So if you're into either one of those sports, these are great places to meet new people who share similar interests as you! Also, Coffman Union shows movies in their theatre every week and the rec center is open for most of the day on the weekdays + Sunday. There are also many concerts and such that take place in the cities during the semester.",
            "The dining hall food is not exactly what I expected and can get old pretty quick. You typically are limited to about 5-6 different food choices and will get sick of them towards the end of your first semester. That's when flex dine comes in handy because you can use that money to eat at different restaurants on campus.",
            "The dorm life is AWESOME! if you get the opportunity to live in the super block, do it! The experience is phenomenal and you won't regret it! The super block is a block consisting of 4 different freshman housing complexes right next to each other. Most freshman live in the super block so you're surrounded by thousands of other freshman every minute you're there!",
            "The U of M is an academically challenging school and the course rigor is pretty difficult. If you plan on attending the U of M, do not stack 2-4 science courses in one semester because the course work will be way too much for you to handle unless you don't mind setting up camp in the library for days at a time.",
            "When scheduling classes, make sure you visit them before the first day because if you don't make it to one of your classes on the first day, your spot in the class might be given up to someone who is on the waitlist for that class. Also, make sure you know whether your class is on the east bank or west bank.",
            "The University of Minnesota Twin Cities is an academically challenging college with a beautiful campus! The U of M offers countless opportunities to get involved on campus and has an endless amount of student groups! The U of M also has a very large and diverse campus so if you love being surrounded by thousands of people on a daily basis, this is the college for you!"

However, make sure to apply before the priority deadline, usually in early December. Look up additional scholarships on the website., 43041=It is best to apply early to the University, usually before their priority deadline in mid December. Your application will be viewed early and as a result given a better chance to be accepted into your college of choice and potential for University scholarships. After choosing to attend to the U of M, it is definitely worth it to live in the dorms for the first year. In the dorms, you have the opportunity to meet alot of people while getting adjusted to campus life. Also, don't worry if you are nervous. Everyone else is in the same boat you are. Just be yourself and be open to new things. It is definitely beneficial to go to class. It may be tempting to just skip some classes, but you will likely find that you will miss more material that you imagined. Also, don't be afraid to meet your professors. They actually like to get to know their students and it can come in handy later when you need a reference or letter of recommendation. Finally, get involved! You will have fun doing something you like while also meeting people. These people may become great friends later on or lead you to someone who can help you down the road in life., 147194=I can't think of a single student who found the academic rigor at the U of M to be lacking. Some courses will naturally be easier than others (especially 1000-level ones); however, those will be worth fewer credit hours in order to reflect that. Also worth iterating is the fact that the common misconception of science and math classes being more difficult is not necessarily true here; as a foreign language major, I can attest to the fact that As are not just handed out willy-nilly. All subject areas require work; there are no easy majors\u00e2??., 999561=The University of Minnesota is a very good school, it is ranked one of the top 10 research universities when I started attending in 2005. The classes are quite large and so you would need to develop a very healthy studying schedule to keep up with course work. That or you can visit the professors during office hours., 36546=The class content depends a bit on what the class is. Especially for first-year classes (1000 level), there are the joke classes that only require a bit of realizing what the professor wants. Good news (maybe...?), however, is that this changes a lot with higher level courses (starting even with the 2000 level ones). All of my professors so far do know their material; when signing up for classes during orientation, try to get into more advanced classes and to pick professors that have won the Morse Award or some other designation. All of that said, what someone learns depends mostly on that person's effort put into the class., 413694=On the East Bank of the Minneapolis campus we have the Weisman Art Museum. This building stands out from any other building on campus because of its postmodern architecture. It was just reopened in the fall of 2011 after it underwent a major expansion project. The museum now has many more works of art on display than it ever had before., 929488=I'd definitely give the University a 9.5 out of 10. I've actually been living here since the beginning of June and honestly I feel welcomed everyday I'm here. The University of Minnesota is full of fun, energetic, and friendly people that make up the rate 9.5, 347397=just a warning: the light rail won't be done until 2015 which blocks off all of washington ave., 770830=There's lots of cheap dates. There's a telescope on the physics building that is free to use after 8 o'clock and they show free movies in one of the buildings before the movies come out on video., 1062419=There are crime alerts that go on and it is very convenient that the university will text you on your phone and email you. Also you can call someone walk with you at night if you feel unsafe, you just call an escort. In addition there is the Gopher Chauffeur that takes calls till 2:00 AM., 929067=If you want to get into the University of Minnesota feel proud. The U of MN had 43,000 applicants for the incoming class of 2017, and only 5500 applicants were accepted. Definitely take your application seriously and meet every deadline.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck I would say, as all colleges, it is definitely pricey, but of all the schools I have visited and been to during the academic year, the University of Minnesota, Twin-Cities offers so much more for your dollar. There are so many different kinds of people on campus, and groups and clubs for everything imagineable, so you are going to find everything you want and way way more for your dollar! The campus is so huge, everything about the classes and teachers is GREAT, and you'll make a million new friends and have so many opportunities going to school in the cities, that is is worth every penny. Am enjoying being here Right between St. Paul and Minneapolis, there is always stuff to do, people to meet, and you will always, always have something new to do every weekend. The sports scene is amazing if you love sports, and the night life is pretty epic, too! I can't tell you enough how much I love the cities, and how campus feels comfortable and safe, but has so many big-city things to see and do! Am learning a lot It is a huge change from high school, in my opinion, when it comes to how much you learn.",
