Generally, tax-exempt organizations must file an annual information return. Tax-exempt organizations that have annual gross receipts not normally in excess of $25,000 are not required to file the annual information return, but may be required to file an annual electronic notice (e-Postcard) Form 990-N. Sadly, The Peter\u2019s AFTAH hasn\u2019t filed any 990s that I can find. \u00a0This is presumably because they rake in less than $25K per year. You all know I\u2019ve been having some Form 990 fun recently. \u00a0So when I read what a hash the IFI made of their anti-Day of Silence protest, my thoughts naturally turned to 990s, IFI, and The Peter. 25 Comments April 16, 2009 at 4:22 PM",

This is yet another example of how society stigmatizes male sexuality, both in heterosexual and gay men.",
