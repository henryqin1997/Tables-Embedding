These talc powders in turn were found to cause severe foreign body reactions in the patients such as peritonitis, chronic fistulae and poor wound healing. By the late 1940's cornstarch was substituted for talc. In 1956 the first cases of starch peritonitis in humans were described in numerous reports. In the 1960's glove manufacturers introduced a rice starch derivative hoping that it would cause fewer problems but it was quickly removed from the market when it was associated with an increased incidence of peritonitis. Presently, throughout the world, most commercially available surgical gloves contain a cornstarch derivative for lubrication. Gloving powders, lotions and creams also generally contain cornstarch. Cases of pelvic peritonitis have been reported following the repeated use of condoms which contained starch powder. Starch may be responsible for extraperitoneal inflammatory reactions and the postpericardiotomy syndrome., 21779=Experiments conducted by the inventor and described in a paper presented by him at the Eighty-fourth Annual Meeting of the Western Surgical Association at Coronado, California on November 16, 1976 have shown that there were no adverse reactions in animals or patients and that one patient who had a previous episode of starch peritonitis had no reaction from surgical gloves treated with sodium bicarbonate as a gloving agent. The lubricant was applied to the glove by shaking a layer of sodium bicarbonate, from a perforated can, over the entire inner and outer surface so as to completely obscure the uncoated surface. Depth of the loose powder, which typically can be 1/16th inch thick, is unimportant so long as the entire device is covered. The glove is then held up and shaken so that most of the loose powder falls off leaving a thin film which adheres to the surface of the rubber or plastic material. The thickness of this film is not important and is dependent on the fineness of the sodium bicarbonate used and on the \"stickness\" of the gloves. Sufficient powder remains to prevent self-adherence and to ease installation of the glove. It is self-regulating in that gloves with tacky surfaces cause powder to remain as required.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets Although sodium bicarbonate is discussed herein as the lubricating agent, for exemplary purposes, it is to be understood that such an embodiment is merely illustrative of and not restrictive on the broad invention and that we do not desire to be limited in our invention to the specific arrangement described because various other obvious combinations and/or modifications may occur to persons having ordinary skill in the art. The gloving agent which is another name for the lubricant may be installed on and in the gloves and surgical devices by techniques presently in use in the industry and known by those skilled in the art. This invention does not disclose or claim the technique for installing the lubricant. This invention involves the discovery that certain alkali metal compounds may be coated on the surfaces of surgical appliances by conventional means where they act as lubricants and gloving agents which are nontoxic and which do not cause adverse reactions in animals or human patients. For example, it may be installed as a powder by dusting the items to be coated or it may be deposited by evaporating an aqueous solution containing the lubricant on the surface of the item to be coated. Sodium bicarbonate is the preferred embodiment. Other nontoxic lubricating coatings of the present invention which may be used to ease installation and to prevent self-adhesion in the storage of plastic, natural or synthetic rubber surgical",
