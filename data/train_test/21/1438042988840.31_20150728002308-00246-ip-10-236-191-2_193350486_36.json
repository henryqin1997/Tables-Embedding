A score of 20 is considered perfect; accordingly, it is rarely if ever awarded in courses that are graded subjectively. 20-point grading scale Edit Most nations have individual grading systems unique to their own schools. However, several international standards for grading have arisen recently. International grading systems Edit [show] Contents The concept of grading students' work quantitatively was developed by a tutor named William Farish, and first implemented by the University of Cambridge in 1792. [1] In education, a grade (or mark) is a teacher's standardized evaluation of a student's work. In some countries, evaluations can be expressed quantifiably, and calculated into a numeric grade point average (GPA). A cumulative grade point average (CGPA) is the mean",
