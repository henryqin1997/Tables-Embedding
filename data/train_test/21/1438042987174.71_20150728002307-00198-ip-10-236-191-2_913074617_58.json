    "textAfterTable": "01/12/2010 Reviewer is A current student here. 7 out of 7 people found this review useful. 2 of 67 Categories Comments Great for these types of students GWU is great for students who want or like a more personal experience with other students and college staff. It is a Christian University so you will not have the typical public university environment. If you are a student seeking a good education, a heart to serve, and a small school GWU is for you. Tips for prospective students I recommend for prospective students that they spend a night or weekend on campus and check out what it has to offer. GWU is great about making the arrangements, you stay in one of the dorms and have a GWU student to hang out with for the weekend. A great way to get the feel of college life, the GWU students and the campus. Bang for the buck The cost of Gardner-Webb is more than a public university but the advantages offered on the campus are worth it. The campus is awesome and provides great places to hang out with",
