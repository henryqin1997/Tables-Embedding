    "textAfterTable": "Description: Help top of page Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs work via stimulating the D2 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, however, either being less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to reactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify allosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the potential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D2 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of allosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor signaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will attenuate receptor signaling. The present project is looking for compound antagonism after an EC80 addition of dopamine by tracking calcium flux in a force-coupled, inducible Hek293 Trex D2 cell",
