But on June 6, 2013, the band canceled its UK/EU tour to focus on developing their new album, which still has no title or release date., 5134=The new LP, \"Strangers to Ourselves,\" was preceded by the single \"Lampshades on Fire,\" a track that's actually been in heavy rotation in Modest Mouse's set lists dating all the way back to 2011. The first news of the LP actually leaked when the band's management started asking for the addresses of some online fans. One member received their package from the band a few days early and took to Twitter to share what Modest Mouse sent: A test pressing of \"Lampshades on Fire\" as well as a typed-out letter from the band., 4567=\"We want you to have this limited test pressing of our new single 'Lampshades On Fire.' The song will be available for purchase tomorrow, Tuesday, December 16,\" the note that accompanied the 45 rpm single read. \"'Lampshades on Fire' is the first single from our new album \"Strangers to Ourselves,\" which will be released on Tuesday, March 3, 2015.\", 3727=Modest is a pretty apt descriptor for the limited success achieved by Modest Mouse in its formative years.
