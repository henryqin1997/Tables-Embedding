A lot of it comes from the fact that it is in the bay area which is usually expensive to live in, but the quality of education here makes it worth it. There is a lot of financial aid available, so it is easy to come up with the money to pay for it. I'm paying about $1000 for the whole year out of pocket and it is definitely worth it, especially for being the number one public university in the world!, 698157=Holi happens every year in April on campus, it is a huge paint fight put on by the Indian Students Association. The lower plaza of campus become plastered with pink and purple. Of course don't forget the huge production of Big Game Week!!, 506096=My dream school since I was thirteen, and I through hard work I was accepted for the Spring 2013, 49183=Living 30 minutes outside of San Francisco certainly has its benefits. Fisherman's Whart, Alcatraz, Union Square, all a short BART trip away. Berkeley itself, however, can be low on the entertainment. There's a lot of places to eat, but not a lot to do. With a few hiking trails, sunny weekends can be put to good use, but considering that it rains most of the time, that option only exists for August/September., 931855=Best Cal tradition is definitely Berkeley Time. Basically, all classes start 10 minutes after the scheduled time. For example, 8 AMs don't actually begin until 8:10 (sometimes even later if you have a pretty chill professor). You could, theoretically, wake up at 8 for your 8 AM. Though I wouldn't suggest doing that for the first few days of class, especially if you don't know the campus very well., 160154=Berkeley offers a great selection of a variety of subjects -- you're sure to find something that you're interested in, and there are a lot of resources available even to people who are undecided. In fact, you're expected to take all sorts of classes! They truly want you to have a full education here, and not just march through a bunch of courses and come out with a diploma. Even in the large classes, professors are friendly and truly want you to be able to succeed., 918577=Get your SAT and GPA scores up! I scored a 2200 and am still nowhere near the top of their prospective class due to a somewhat subpar 3.85 GPA., 1066887=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 83811=Compared to private school tuition, the tuition at UC Berkeley is considerably affordable for in-state students. (Out-of-state pay 3 times as much as in-state.) That being said, tuition has doubled since I started college in 2009. These tuition hikes by the UC Regents have been causing a stir at all the UC campuses. Many of my lectures have 300-500 people and I have been one of 15 or 20 regulars at a professor\u2019s office hours (the average class size of some small liberal arts colleges). Dorm and apartment living is also pretty expensive, but I wouldn\u2019t expect much less living in the bay area. If you are willing to pay to be taught by some of the world\u2019s leading minds but do not necessarily care about a lot of one-on-one interaction with professors, then you won\u2019t be disappointed.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot In high school, I never imagined there could be so many subjects outside of Math, English, American History, and so on. But at Berkeley, it's hard to decide on what to fill your schedule with because of the hundreds of classes to choose from. You can study almost any subject you can think of and learn from some of the top professors in the world. In your first year or two at Berkeley, you can take classes called Discovery Courses if you are unsure exactly what you want to study. They help students who just want to experience the basics, who want to test the waters before diving in. You can also take seminars that are only open to freshmen and are limited to 20 or less students. In these classes, you can get much of the focus and attention you need and they are only once or twice a week so you can take several. I know many people are undecided when they enter college and it can be scary not knowing what you want to do when you grow up, but a lot of those people don't know that most people at Cal are like that! But the beauty of being undecided is that you can experience MANY different kinds of classes first. You have the opportunity to learn so much more outside of that limited range of high school subjects.",
