Note to July 7 Pups in the Park Ticket Holders: DUE TO THE JULY 7 HEAT ADVISORY, PLEASE DO NOT BRING YOUR DOG TO THE GAME AND FOLLOW OUR HEAT SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS, 92246=\"7:31 p.m. \u2026. Nieves chased a curve way out of the zone.\"So glad he's doing that for some other team & not the Nats. He used to drive me to distraction with his inability to lay off pitches in the opposite batter's box., 77764=Morse bad in RF. Need Werth. Sorry, peric.Seen this in 2010. Hamstring is bothering Morse \u2026 seems like he needs the #DL.As for Werth, after another injury to the same wrist? Kind of like your predictions about how well CM Wang would pitch? No way Werth is going to be the same \u2026 especially on defense but also on defense.In other words don't ask you might get your wish and rue the day., 2236=COLORADO ROCKIES at WASHINGTON NATIONALS Where: Nationals Park Gametime: 7:05 p.m. EDT TV: MASN2, MLB.tv Radio: WJFK (106.7 FM), WFED (1500 AM), XM 185 Weather: Mostly clear, 97 degrees, Wind 5 mph LF to RF, 35458=Now looking at the pitching:Adjusted defense/park neutral tRA and pRAA (used to calculate the WAR)Gio Gonazlez: 2.28 tRA, 19.0 pRAA (superb / All Star)Stephen Strasburg: 2.50 tRA, 18.0 pRAA (superb/ All Star)Ross Detwiler 2.99 tRA, 9.2 pRAA (excellent)Edwin Jackson 3.83 tRA, 4.9 pRAA (very good!)Jordan Zimmermann 4.49 tRA, -2.1 pRAA (somewhat below average)I'm expecting Zimmermann to improve dramatically in the 2nd half. But they lose Stras in September. Couild J. Zimmnn make up for Stras's loss?BullpenTyler Clippard: 0.85 tRA, +13.4 pRAA (superb)Sean Burnett; 2.40 tRA, +5.8 pRAA (very good)Craig Stammen: 3.05 tRA, +5.7 pRAA (very good)Michael Gonzalez: 2.84 tRA, +1.3 pRAA (average to good)Tom Gorzelanny: 4.34 tRA 0.0 pRAA (average), 27178=the team is honestly looking to win this year, and might have to make a deal that only looks at the short term.+1/2St.@1/2 Street,I firmly believe ownership has bought into the notion of not making any dramatic moves unless they are both for the short-term (this year) AND the long-term. That means you aren't going to see the Nats doing what that nut Chris Needham seems to espouse: trading prospects from a 35+ year old slugger and I don't really care if its Pujols. It would NOT be the right move for this team; the strategy (Werth being the unfortunate exception) IS working and we are seeing the results are we not?So, why change the strategy? The only reason might be because the new CBA has cut an enormous hole in one major thrust of that strategy: acquiring high-ceiling, young talent no matter what the cost in the draft and then developing them internally. But, again, I only see them trading for young to very young prospects that they were unable to acquire in the draft. And from the looks of things \u2026 so far \u2026 the 2012 draft could end up marked as a close to complete failure \u2026 we'll have to see what Stanford's Brett Moneyham is like. Hopefully, he is money like his name., 13147=It seems that the trade rumors are starting to include the Nats, and that will certainly feed our conversations pretty well. We have to steel ourselves to lose someone or a few people that we are pretty attached to. For instance, we will need to be realistic and not overly emotional if Tyler Moore leaves as just one part of a trade, or if we never see Alex Meyer in DC. Unlike in 2005, when the team gave up pretty much nothing to get nothing (Preston Wilson), the team is honestly looking to win this year, and might have to make a deal that only looks at the short term.+1/2St., 103484=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows.

Look up Nate Karn's bonus in the 12th round in 2009. It was $225,000; third highest that year.Sure looks like he was worth it. He looks a lot better than Silver Spike's runner up AJ Morris at the level he is at. Rizzo, Clark et al know their stuff.The 2nd and 3rd round picks in 2012 didn't even get close to that high. And the talent level is significantly lower. The only player who is at or exceeds the talent level of most of the 2009 top 15 pitchers is Giolito. Same is true in 2010. Same is true for 2011. Things are different now.}",
