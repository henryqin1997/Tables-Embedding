Murphy warmed the bench for the early games, before starting the decisive fixture against Argentina, which Ireland lost., 9144=Murphy made four appearances during the 2008 Six Nations and two on tour to Australia and New Zealand, before being recalled by new Ireland coach Declan Kidney for Ireland's final autumn international against Argentina., 9398=He retained his place in the Ireland set-up for the historic 2009 Six Nations Grand Slam season - featuring as a replacement in four of the games. And he also tasted success on the domestic stage skippering Leicester, in the absence of Martin Corry, to the Guinness Premiership crown and the final of the Heineken Cup., 9751=He was installed as Leicester's official captain ahead of the start of the 2009-10 season but his campaign got off to the worst possible start as he dislocated his shoulder against Wasps in September, ruling him out of action for the remainder of the year. His return came at the start of the Six Nations and he was soon back in the international setup. He deputised for the injured Rob Kearney as Ireland beat England at Twickenham and retained his place for the subsequent clashes with Wales and Scotland in spite of Kearney's return to full fitness., 10643=He featured only once during the November internationals, against Argentina, but looked set to reclaim the No.15 jersey from the injured Kearney for the 2011 Six Nations. However, Murphy suffered an ankle injury in Leicester's Aviva Premiership victory over Northampton on January 8 and it was later confirmed that he would miss the entire Championship, and potentially the rest of the season., 8159=Murphy's early career was spent on the wing thanks to the presence of Tim Stimpson at Leicester, but he impressed sufficiently to win his first Ireland cap against the USA in 2000., 8374=Murphy was an ever-present in the Ireland squad for the next two seasons, winning the Irish Sport Writers Player of the Season award at the end of the 2003 season. Murphy broke his leg prior to the 2003 Rugby World Cup, but his ambition saw him bounce back into the Ireland squad. He was selected for the British and Irish Lions in 2005, winning a Test cap in the third and final Test against the All Blacks.}",
