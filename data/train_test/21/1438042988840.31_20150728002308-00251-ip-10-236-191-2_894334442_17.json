            "with a little bit of construction going on at the moment, safety is a must. with the work that north idaho college puts in to keep its students safe, the construction is just an inconvenience and not a hazard.",
            "this college is a great place to get your two year degree. although if one wants to get a four year degree, lewis and clark state college has a set up right here on campus and will allow one to take classes here instead of in lewiston.",
            "a must see event on campus is art on the green. it is a place where people from all over bring their handmade items and sell them. with music and games this is a great event for kids and adults alike.",
            "north idaho college is literally right on the beach. in the summertime one can swim in between classes, or just hang out with friends. a great location to play beach volleyball and get a tan.",
            "the food in the cafeteria is a little costly, but with a variety of foods to choose from, a nice lunch at the school isn't so bad. also, with the downtown area so close, a person can walk to one of the many restaurants on sherman avenue. from hamburger stands to italian food, the choices are endless!",
            "i cannot speak for the dorms because i have not been in them before.",
            "with a wide variety of classes, one could easily pick out the classes appropriate to their current level of education. of course, harder classes are going to require more energy, but the amount of knowledge that one will gain will make up for the energy lost.",
            "working hard is the key to graduating from this school. just like anything in life it isn't easy, but the result is worth it.",
            "north idaho college is a great school that encourages students to work hard and accomplish their goals. the teachers are enthusiastic and creative in helping their students progress. north idaho college is truly a great place for a person to start their college education."

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot I am a high school student dual-enrolling at NIC, and its been a fine experience. I have learned most from my elective classes rather than the core classes. In my history class, for example, I haven't learned much. However, I have learned A LOT from my psychology and communications classes. It depends a lot on your attitude towards the class.
