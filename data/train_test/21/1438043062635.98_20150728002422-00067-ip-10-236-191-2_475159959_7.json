Further, since numerous modifications and variations will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation illustrated and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention. Major objectives and advantages of the present invention are convenience and cost reduction (where appropriate, safe, and effective). The prescription processing network stands to benefit physicians, pharmacists, and patients. More particularly, a physician's time can be efficiently spent treating patients, and prescription requests can be submitted when such an action will not adversely effect the time available to treat patients. Furthermore, pharmacists can focus his or her time and attention to accurate preparation of prescriptions without interruption. Patients also benefit in several ways. First, scheduled appointments are easier to maintain. The quality of care received is improved because the physician's time is not wasted on other tasks, such as submitting prescription requests. Furthermore, costs are reduced because of the improved efficiency realized by the physician and pharmacist. can also be used to store the program information that is used",
