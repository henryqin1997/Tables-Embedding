When the storage disc is completed by merely changing the thickness of the adhesive agent bonded to the adhesive sheet body, the thickness of the intermediate layer (adhesive agent layer) between the lower disc-shaped substrate and upper disc-shaped substrate can be easily changed. It is possible to automate the application of adhesive agent on one of disc-shaped substrates, thereby enabling the very effective sequential laminating steps. With the arrangement of the method of laminating the disc-shaped substrates according to the present invention, the adhesive agent separated from the adhesive sheet body can be uniformly bonded to the surface of the lower disc-shaped substrate without containing air bubbles, etc. and also without generating wrinkling therebetween which is different from the conventional method using UV cured resin, the developing step of the adhesive agent and the irradiating step of UV are respectively dispensed with, thereby reducing the manufacturing steps of the storage disc. Further the peeling means may be of any type capable of stretching by holding thereof in addition to the peeling roller. The pressing of the adhesive sheet body in the first station X or the pressing of the two disc-shaped substrates in the third",
