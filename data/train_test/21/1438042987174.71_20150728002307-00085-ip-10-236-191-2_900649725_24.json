            "Greek life here is unlike the greek life at any other school in the nation. It consists of so much more than t-shirts and parties, and the stereotypes for each organization are completely different than those of national organizations. Greek life is taken very seriously here and each organization holds true to a set of values and standards defined by their constitutions. Our organizations are very tight-knit and truly work to empower the their members.",

            "A Bell Run consists of stripping off your clothes, running naked from the chapel to the victory bell, ringing the bell, and running back without getting caught. People rarely do this.",
            "There isn't much to do on the weekends besides go to parties or leave Seguin. However, the parties are pretty cool.",
            "The food gets very old, very fast. Not much variety.",
            "The dorms here are excellent and provide a fun and welcoming environment for all who live in them.",
            "Academics are pretty difficult, but professors are extremely helpful and accommodating. They will do everything in their power to make sure their students are learning and becoming well-rounded and educated individuals."

I was accepted to TLU in December of 2008 and started attending August of 2008 and have been there since. Providing small classes that consist of around 20 to 25 students really does make a difference. At TLU you matter unlike other institutions where your just another kid in the class. All the teachers know your name and always are encouraging you to ask questions and very helpful when you are unsure about things. TLU offers free tutoring Sunday-Thursday for all math courses, physics, etc. They even have a writing tutor! The higher level classes have an SI which has already taken the class and offers study sessions for homeworks and upcoing tests. From a personal experience, a few classmates as well as I had trouble in our economics class which didn't not have a tutor or an SI, so the teacher himself set a once a week study session with the 4 of us! It truly made a difference! Overall TLU has taught me so much. I still have much to learn and I wouldn't choose any other insitution to be at while I progress in my learning experience!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students I would recommend TLU for any student who actually cares about learning and want to be an active part of their education. If you want to go to college to sit through lectures unnoticed and come out with a degree, this is not the school for you. Education at TLU is an interactive process, and passion is required. TLU is a great place for anyone looking for a small, home-town environment with lots of personal attention. TLU is for anyone who wants to be treated as more than just a number and a statistic. Tips for prospective students If you can, definitely try to visit the campus. It is one thing to see pictures and read about what's here, but to get a good feel for TLU, visiting the campus is the only way to do it. Also, don't be afraid to talk to people, especially your Admissions Representative. When I was applying, I kept in close contact with him and he actually knew who I was by face and name. They want you to bug them with questions! The staff truly wants to help you with what you need, so don't be afraid to ask. Stay in close contact, and you will be very memorable, which is always a good thing. Bang for the buck",
