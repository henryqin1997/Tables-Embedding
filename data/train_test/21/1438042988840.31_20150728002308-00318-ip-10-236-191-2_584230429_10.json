The position of the scale dials at this stage is shown in Figure 4-26. The course angle (20 degrees) is read on the inner scale on the length of target scale dial, against the range (2300 yards) on the range scale dial. The angle thus found is measured from the line of sight of the periscope. Note that the course angle is measured without regard to the direction of movement of the target, and may be either the angle observed, or its supplement, in this case 160 degrees., 208990=Copyright \u00a9 2013, Maritime Park Association All Rights Reserved Legal Notices and Privacy Policy Version 1.10, 22 Oct 04}",

Objective operating mechanism assembly (Figure 4-23). 3. Stadimeter housing assembly (Figure 4-24). These three assemblies are not in contact with each other for actuation in direct series. The objective operating mechanism assembly and the lower (split) objective lens and mount assembly connect directly with each other. However, the three assemblies are so connected by shafts and couplings that they act as a unit. Three other assemblies are placed between the objective operating mechanism assembly and the stadimeter housing assembly for mechanical and optical reasons. These three assemblies are: 1. First inner tube section assembly (Figure 4-27). 2. Eyepiece skeleton assembly (Figure 4-28). 3. Eyepiece box and miscellaneous assemblies (Figure 4-29). The stadimeter housing assembly contains gearing which is connected to the internal mechanism of the eyepiece box (11, Figure 4-29) and eyepiece skeleton assembly by a female tang coupling (68, Figure 4-24) that projects upward from the stadimeter housing assembly and engages on a milled tang at the lower end of the stadimeter transmission shaft (22, Figure 4-27) in the",

Each is provided with eccentric flanges with an offset of 0.197 inch from the original axis. The mounts are not a complete half circle, as a part is cut away to provide clearance for the attachment of large and small side clamps (7 and 8) secured with lockscrews (11) to the split faces of the mounts. The lens walls project upward from the eccentric flange with a nominal wall thickness. A narrow shoulder is provided next to the bottom of the inner circumference of the lens wall, to which the plano surface of each split flint element is retained. Each lens wall has two radial slotted openings of appropriate length, separated at a 90 degrees angle for the insertion of two tension plugs (3). These are retained by tension plug springs (4) which are secured with two lockscrews each (12). Each eccentric flange has two elongated holes to provide the necessary adjustment over the inserted stadimeter collimating screws (13). The outer face of each elongation is countersunk for the stadimeter collimating screw washers (14). The lower face of each eccentric has two key recesses for the mount keys (9). The elongations and keys are parallel in each mount half. In",
