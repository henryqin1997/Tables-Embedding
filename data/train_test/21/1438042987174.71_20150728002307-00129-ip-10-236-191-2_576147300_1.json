Profile information lists the test performed, inclusive of the test fee, when a profile is ordered and includes reporting names and individual availability. -During follow-up, changes in the urine supersaturation can be used to monitor the effectiveness of therapy by confirming that the crystallization potential has indeed decreased. -Individual components of the supersaturation profile can identify specific risk factors for stones. -In patients who have a radiopaque stone, for whom stone analysis is not available, the supersaturation data can be used to predict the likely composition of the stone. This may help in designing a treatment program. Diagnosis and management of patients with renal lithiasis: Useful For Suggests clinical disorders or settings where the test may be helpful Yes NY State Approved Indicates the status of NY State approval and if the test is orderable for NY State clients.",
