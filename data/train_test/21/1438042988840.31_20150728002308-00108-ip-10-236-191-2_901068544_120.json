Imagine yourself as a student, walking through the hallways, eating in the cafeteria, sitting the classrooms, and reading in the library. This will help decide whether Pace is right for you! Bang for the buck Pace is a private institution that is quite costly. What helped me to make my college decision was the amount of scholarship money I received. Pace provides 95% of its students with merit based scholarships and financial aid, so there is help in paying for school. Is it a bang for the buck? I would say so considering I believe it is a great school with numerous challenging courses that will help me to become a successful business woman. Am enjoying being here I love being at this school because there is always something to do. Whether it be a club event inside school or the thrill of city life outside of Pace's doors, you will never be bored. The university provides a friendly, welcoming environment that is definitely carried on in the classroom as well. Am learning a lot",
