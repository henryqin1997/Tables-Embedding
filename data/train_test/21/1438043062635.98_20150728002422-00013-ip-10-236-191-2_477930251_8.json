The prints thus formed exhibited low intercolor bleed with a MFLEN value of 5. An ink composition was prepared as described in Example XI except that the initial amount of deionized water was 38.1 grams (and not 46.4 grams) and that 33.3 grams of PROJET YELLOW 1G dye solution (dye solution contained 7.5 percent by weight dye solids, obtained from Zeneca Colors, Dighton, Mass.) and 25.0 grams of Acid Yellow 17 dye (dye solution contained 10 percent by weight dye solids, obtained from Tricon Colors, Elmwood Park, N.J.) were substituted for the PROJET MAGENTA 1T and Acid Red 52 dyes.
