The Intel Core i7 microprocessor is built using the codename \"Nehalem\" micro architecture, that allows chips to handle more data, quicker and more energy efficiently. Go inside Intel's labs and meet some of the thousands of Intel engineers who helped design and test the new processor. \"Building this microprocessor brings a lot of people together, like architects, micro architects and the design teams,\" says Rani Borkar, vice president of Intel's Digital Enterprise Group. \"As you get into the development phases, working with the process technology, it's a mind-boggling effort that requires a lot of teamwork across the board.\" Before going into the specifications and features of the entire Intel Core i7 processor series we thought some background information about the new Nehalem technology might be in order. While doing research for this review I came a cross a very useful document on Intel's website entitled: \"First the Tick, Now the Tock: Next Generation Intel Micro-architecture (Nehalem)\". This white paper article helped me to gain a much better understanding of not only the features we'll see today in the Core i7 series of processors, but in future product releases we're likely to see that will implement other aspects of the Nehalem architecture. The article itself is 8 pages long so I'll leave it to you to read it in its entirety, but I will share a few excerpts that may help you to gain",
