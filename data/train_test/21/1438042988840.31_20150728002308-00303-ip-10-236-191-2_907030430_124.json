Teacher to student ratio are about 1:25 and its a beautiful campus all year long., 17084=Since I am an out of state student, it's a little more expensive than you would expect. But they do offer a Western Undergraduate Exchange Waiver (WUE) to most students who come from the northwest area (oregon, idaho, california, etc. There's more information about which states are covered on their website). This helped me out a lot. There are a lot of scholarships too, and you can apply for almost all of them with one application at the beginning of february. The cost is worth it though; the campus is beautiful and they have a lot to offer!, 344105=Don't worry too much about your GPA and SAT scores. As long as you're a 3.0 or above with a 1500 SAT you have a really high chance of getting in. I had a 3.164 GPA and a 1500 SAT score and I got an acceptance letter 4 days after I submitted it. Also, if you're recommended to do the essays, you should do them because it never hurts to try., 538123=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Reviewer has been to campus. 13 out of 14 people found this review useful. 2 of 124 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Central is great for students who like individual attention and having professors that aren't even in your majors department care about you and how you're doing. Tips for prospective students Bring a fan and a winter jacket. You WILL need both. It's a small town but you can always find something to do on or off campus.
