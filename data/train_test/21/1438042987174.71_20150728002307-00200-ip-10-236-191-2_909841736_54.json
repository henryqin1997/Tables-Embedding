            "1.Go to office hours if you need help. 2.Check Email/Blackboard regularly. 3.Register for more then you can handle early. Go to the first day and get a feel for the instructors. Drop the classes before the first drop date that you don't want so that you have a good schedule. 4. Freshman year take out loans and get a job try and save up for a down payment on a house. Buy a house sophomore year and rent out rooms. You will live pretty much for free and your friends will pay your mortgage. By the end of your senior year if you plan on moving sell the house and use that capital to buy one where you are moving or keep it as a rental property and then rent to girls they take care of it more the guys typical.",

It gets really cold in Fargo with the wind. - Do not let one teacher/professor make you rethink your major. Where there is one bad teacher there are ten great ones. - Join organizations that you find interesting and want to support or start your own organization. - Set an alarm for 7:55 am on Mondays when football tickets go on sale. Make sure you are logged on at 8 am or you may not get a ticket to the game and that is no fun., 328975=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 38261=Food is really good compared to other cafeteria style dining. It has its ups and downs. I don't prefer their asian food, but man is their burger bar the best thing ever. Take advantage of the chocolate milk! And get creative with the grills. There's so much you can make on your own in the dining center! One down side I have is, all the dining centers are closed on the weekend except for The Residence Dining Center. It's a big bummer during the winter. Living in Dinan, I had to get some confidence to make the trek during -40 degrees in January., 221202=March over!!!!!!!!!!}",

    "textAfterTable": "NDSU is not the costliest of colleges, but you really do get your bang for your buck. It is in a semi-rural area, the professors are very knowledgeable, and the people are just so friendly and welcoming. A great investment for any student. What to do for fun Attend sporting events! (especially Bison football games), join clubs/programs, rollerblade or bike around campus, visit the Wellness Center to either work-out or rock climb or even take part in one of the fitness classes such as Zumba! Food and Dining The dining centers at NDSU offer students with plenty of variety and the menus for each dining center are posted online each day so you can figure out which meal best suits you for the day. Very convenient, not too costly, and the food is definitely good! Dorm Life The high-rises are a great option. Pavek, Seim, Sevrionson, or Thompson are all nice options to live during your first, second, or third/fourth years if you chose to do so. The other older dormitories are also a great choice because they are located next to frequently visited buildings which makes it easy for students. The LLC apartments are very fancy and absolutely beautiful. Academic Rigor",
