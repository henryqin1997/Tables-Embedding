After each column there are comments sections.May 13, 2013 7:29 PMThanks much, Joe!, 38403=Just Google \"Braves blogs.\" I turned up several that way. Can't find it now, but one Braves game thread offered a bit of a reality/perspective check, as a commenter shared about the recent death of a friend. Baseball's a nice diversion and all, but it's not life or death, generally speaking, so there's that. (No, \"I live for this\" doesn't count.)Joe Seamhead said\u2026 SonnyG10, you can start by just going to the Atlanta Journal Constitution, go to sports, then Braves.

Lots of mileage, last season mostly marred with a long recovery from yet another serious injury \u2026 a fracture of the same wrist that almost ended his career. He's on the decline and that's just a sign \u2026And if you want to argue that you can take it up with Mike Rizzo Eric because that is a LARGE reason why we no longer have Michael Morse in the lineup. Because similar injuries kept happening to him and he is now 30+., 194503=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC. Images provided by Getty Images. Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 22306=JayB said\u2026 When is it no longer \"still Early\"? When this team misses the playoffs with 88 wins with it still be early? Rizzo needs to make roster moves and do it now.On this date last year, the Nats at 21-13 were 0.5 game behind the 22-13 Braves. Today, the 20-17 Nats are 1 game behind the 21-16 Braves. If it's too late now, it was too late then. How'd that 2012 season turn out, anyway?, 54175=I tend to agree, swami. I think it actually bodes well that he and Davey have long maintained that his shoulder won't be right until June. Makes me think they expected this kind of shaky return and explains why Davey is unshakable in asserting that Zim is their 3rd basemen.Is it possible the problems are irreversible? Of course. He's only human. But, I don't see that it's inevitable. Especially, as you say, because of his attitude and how he has handled adversity in the past., 1439=Into that fray come the Nationals, who send their burgeoning ace to the mound for the series opener. With a strong effort tonight, Jordan Zimmermann could become the majors' first 7-game winner, not an insignificant accomplishment. Josh Beckett starts for the Dodgers, and remarkably he's still seeking his first win of 2013., 47218=On this date last year, the Nats at 21-13 were 0.5 game behind the 22-13 Braves. Today, the 20-17 Nats are 1 game behind the 21-16 Braves.Thus prompted, I went back to May 13-14, 2012. Werth had broken his arm, Ramos had just blown out his knee, the bullpen was hurt (Storen and Lidge) and ineffective (HRod), and LaRoche was about the only one hitting worth a damn. And there were three or four regular posters who just didn't like anything, at great length, in pretty much inverse proportion to their apparent knowledge of the game.Plus \u00e7a change\u2026, 28664=Joe Seamhead said\u2026I spent some time today reading some of the vile being spewed by Braves fans today. Wow, are they turning on both Uptons on the blogs. Reminded me of Phillie fans. Sure am glad it isn't like that here.May 13, 2013 6:33 PMJoe, do you have a link for the Braves blog? I'd like to read some of what their fans are saying.}",
