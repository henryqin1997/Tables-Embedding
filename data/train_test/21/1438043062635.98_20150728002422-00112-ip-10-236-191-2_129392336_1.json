Scientists are interested in small-world graphs In recent years, the principle has proven important in and modelled mathematically by D. Watts and S. Strogatz in the 1990s.

Its internal representation is a symbol table of sets: the keys are vertices and the values are the sets of neighbors (the vertices adjacent to the key) This representation uses the two data types ST.java and SET.java that we introduced in Section 4.4. Our implementation has three important properties: Clients can efficiently iterate through the graph vertices. Clients can efficiently iterate through a vertex's neighbors. Space usage is proportional to the number of edges. Performer-movie",
