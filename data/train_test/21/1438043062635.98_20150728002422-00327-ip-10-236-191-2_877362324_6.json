    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{58505=5/9/13: The NL East is starting to take the form everyone expected. There are the Nationals, the Braves, and everyone else. The only difference is that the Braves are still 2.5 games up on Washington. This is due in no small part to the amazing April that Justin Upton put together. Upton had 97 at bats in 27 games. He slugged 7 homeruns and drove in 19. He swiped five bases, had 15 walks to six strikeouts. His batting average was .340 and reached base almost half the time he got to bat. He currently leads the majors in home runs and is the early candidate for MVP., 21464=7/24/14: OK Braves' fans, your nightmare is officially over. The team released second baseman Dan Uggla. Uggla has not been the same player for the last year and a half as he was in his younger days. He was phenomenal with the Marlins early in his career, making three All-Star teams. He has hit below .200 since the start of the 2013 season. Uggla lost his starting position earlier in the year and was suspended by the team last week. He is signed through 2015, so the Braves will have to still pay him around $19 million., 22006=7/17/14: While the Atlanta Braves are neck-and-neck with the Washington Nationals for NL East supremacy (and all the other teams in the division have decided to take an early offseason), all is not perfect for the team. The Braves, quite simply, have an Uggla problem. The very expensive second baseman has only had 18 at-bats since the end of May. Overall, he is slashing just .162/.241/331 over 145 plate appearances this season. Manager Fredi Gonzalez also suspended him one game for 'extreme tardiness' over the weekend. Uggla is scheduled to make $13 million in 2014 AND 2015. Combined with his poor play, a trade seems unlikely. The Braves may end up designating him for assignment and eating the roughly $18 million left., 11955=1/7/15: The Braves seem to be doing a lot this offseason to revamp the roster. They traded away outfielder Jason Heyward to the St. Louis Cardinals for starting pitcher Shelby Miller a few weeks ago. They also signed Nick Markakis, formerly of the Baltimore Orioles. The Markakis signing may grab some headlines, but he is not the same player he was just a few years ago. Additionally, the Braves reportedly are offering Evan Gattis to the Houston Astros. The catch is that the Astros would also have to take B.J. Upton, and at this point no one wants to take Upton or his salary. President John Hart did have a funny line when asked about his moves, saying 'it's not like we broke up the 1927 Yankees\"., 39451=12/26/13: An interesting story appeared about the great Greg Maddux in his prospect days. In 1985, Mets scout Duffy Dwyer reported that Maddux was not strong enough to be a starter, was small and ran out of gas late in the season. That was when Maddux was in single-A ball and finished with a 13-9 record. He debuted with the Cubs in 1986 and had two unremarkable years. He then rolled off 17 straight seasons with 14 or more wins. He finished his career with a 355-227 record, 3.16 ERA and a 1.143 WHIP. Now he is a certainty for the Hall of Fame. It looks like the scout missed on Maddux., 63919=Ben Sheets put together a quality outing for the Atlanta Braves on Wednesday night, but it was not enough as they were defeated by the Miami Marlins by the score of 4-2. Sheets lasted 6.2 innings, allowing three earned runs on 11 hits and a walk. He also added eight strikeouts, and despite giving up the three runs, keep his ERA at a solid 1.46 on the year. Offensively, Dan Uggla added his 50th run batted in of the year, despite the Braves offense hitting a paltry 2-10 with runners in scoring position. Uggla currently sports a .273 batting average to go along with the 50 RBI's for the Braves as they push for a playoff spot heading into August and September., 42931=11/14/13: The Atlanta Braves made a surprise announcement this week in that they are proceeding to build a new stadium in the Atlanta suburbs in Cobb County. They are expected to move at the end of their lease with Turner Field, which expires at the end of 2016. The Braves have only played in Turner Field since 1997. The stadium was built for the 1996 Summer Olympics and is relatively new. The Braves claim that the stadium needs major renovations and even that is not enough, thus they need a new stadium. The question remains, though, who will foot the bill for the new stadium?, 36960=1/23/14: In yet another deal to avoid arbitration, the Braves and Mike Minor agreed to a one year deal for $3.85 million. That is a big raise for Minor, who made only $505,000 last season. It was the first year that Minor was available for arbitration and was considered a 'super two' player. That is, a player with between two and three years of service, has at 86 days of service in the previous season, and ranks in the top 22% in total service. That is not confusing at all. Minor had a 3.21 ERA with 181 strikeouts in 2013, and was able to pitch himself into the number two spot in the Braves' rotation., 17150=9/24//14: It just keeps going from bad to worse for Evan Gattis of the Atlanta Braves. He was taken out of the lineup on September 7 due to strep throat. . That took some time to heal. But he cannot get back on the field yet because he now has kidney stones - which makes the strep throat seem like a tropical vacation. It is possible that he gets past this latest ailment to rejoin the team. Atlanta will be like the rest of America and watching the playoffs from home this fall, but at least he has a chance to finish on a good note., 48845=9/4/13: The Upton brothers were excited last offseason when they found a way to be paired together in Atlanta. Justin has had a fine season, unfortunately older brother B.J. has struggled all season. His batting average is .186 and he may not be on the field come playoff time. At least he had one moment of glory. B.J. had a home run and four hits - including an 11th inning game winning RBI, as the Braves beat the Miami Marlins. The Braves are on cruise control with a 15 game lead in the NL East. The question is if a September call up will take B.J.'s spot in the line up down the stretch., 45308=10/17/13: What will happen to the Braves this offseason? Atlanta dominated the National League up until September. Granted, they did win the NL East by 10 games over the Washington Nationals, but they also let off the gas and allowed the St. Louis Cardinals to catch them for the best record in the NL. Following that, they were eliminated by the L.A. Dodgers in four games despite having home field advantage in the series. It is hard to go against a team that won 96 games, but the way the Braves finished may give management a pause to consider some changes in the offseason., 44710=10/24/13: All who are fans of both the Atlanta Braves and Seinfeld should hope that the Braves give a roster spot to Jose Constanza next season. OK, so the name is not completely correct, but it is close enough. Constanza is a 30 year old journman minor league outfielder. He does not hit especially well - either for average or power - but the guy can sure run. He may land on the big league team as a defensive substitute or pinch runner in 2014. He is probably not a guy that will turn things around for a team, but does appear to have value as a basestealer and defensive sub., 47096=9/26/13: The Braves being in the playoffs is nothing new. They completely owned the NL East for over a decade and won a World Series. That was a few years ago. They were edged out in 2011 when the Cardinals made their historic run for the championship and were eliminated in the NL wild card game (again by St. Louis) last season. There is no chase or wild card this season as the team has a commanding lead over the Nationals. They missed a chance to wrap up the division against the Cubs but finally got their place. Now the question is who else will join them?, 66981=The Atlanta Braves have won five of their past six to bring them back into the National League East race after dropping their pervious eight in a row. The Braves are only a game and a half back of the division lead after falling to last place during the losing streak. Second baseman Dan Uggla is leading the team in home runs (10), RBIs (37), runs (41), and OPS (.867). The fans have recognized Uggla for his play so far as he is the leading vote getter for National League second basemen for the 2012 MLB All-Star game according to the first numbers released by MLB., 61386=10/2/12 - For the second straight month, Atlanta Braves starting pitcher Kris Medlen was named the National League Pitcher of the Month for September. Since being moved to the starting rotation Medlen has been a force. The right-hander had a 4-0 record in September, was first in the Majors with 46 strikeouts and recorded a 1.26 ERA in 43.0 innings pitched. The Atlanta Braves have won 23 straight games when Medlen has started. He finishes the year with a 10-1 record with 1 save and 1.57 ERA. Medlen will be the starting pitcher during the Braves wild card game against the St. Louis Cardinals., 56529=5/30/13: Brandon Beachy underwent Tommy John surgery on his right elbow last June. He has already thrown in simulated games as well as extended spring training. He threw 35 out of 70 pitches for strikes and is a bit shaky but reports on his velocity have been strong. If all goes well he should be back in the majors by the end of June. On Tuesday after 10 innings Atlanta had a victory over the Toronta Blue Jays! McCann, (a catcher) was the designated hitter on Tuesday and said \"We hit a lot of home runs and we're going to strike out, But you put up seven runs, there's nothing bad about that at all.\", 32615=3/13/14: The Braves are holding their collective breaths right now as pitcher Kris Medlen left a spring training game early on Sunday against the New York Mets. He appeared to injure his elbow on consecutive pitches in the fourth inning. The second pitch had no juice and landed well in front of home plate. The early diagnosis is a forearm strain, and if so, then that would actually be good news. Medlen underwent Tommy John surgery in 2010, and so there is always the risk of greater damage. Here is hoping that it is minor and Medlen is back on the mound soon., 52527=7/25/13: In many senses, it is amazing that the Braves are seven games up in the NL East standings. The team got off to a great start, but has been just OK for the past month or so. The good news is that no other team in the East seems to want to challenge the Braves, which is remarkable considering the talent on the Nationals. More good news for the Braves - they have among the easiest schedules in the league down the stretch. Most of their games are against sub-500 teams and they rarely have to leave the Eastern or Central time zones. It is not necessarily a cake walk to October, but they have the easiest path of anybody in contention., 16544=10/1/14: The Atlanta Braves are now on the golf course rather than being in the postseason. The Braves have had a pretty good run of things over the past several years, though missed out on winning the big prize every time. So the team decided it was time to move on from General Manager Frank Wren. Wren had held that position since 2007 and did a pretty good job overall. He can be fairly criticized for big contracts to B.J. Upton and Dan Uggla, but his teams were generally competitive and made the postseason on several occasions. This is not one of those years as injuries built up., 9513=2/18/15: The Atlanta Braves have curiously been picking up relief pitchers this offseason, though that was not expected to be a pressing need by most. Now we know why. Reliever Shae Simmons has a torn UCL and underwent the dreaded Tommy John surgery recently. He will miss all of the 2015 season. He had a great season going last year with a 2.91 ERA and 23/11 strike out to walk ratio in almost 22 innings. Unfortunately, he elbow let him down. The Braves had added Jose Veras, Matt Capps and Todd Coffey to the bullpen mix over the last several weeks with the hope of replacing Simmons for this season., 7634=3/11/15: The Atlanta Braves are expected to have enough problems in 2015 without having to deal with a litany of injuries like they did last year. There are so many new faces and young guys that veteran closer Craig Kimbal had tee-shirts made up with the familiar \"Hello, my name is...\" name tag sticker on them. All jokes aside, the Braves had to scratch starter Mike Minor from his start last week with more shoulder problems. He missed time last season with the same problem and the team can only hope that it is not too serious and that he can come back and be effective., 55765=6/6/13: The veteran Hudson finished May with a 7.33 ERA after ending April with a 3.86 ERA. On Friday night's series opener against the Nationals, Upton was out of the starting lineup once again. \"He understands to a certain point,\" Gonzalez said. \"...We've had conversations. He's making the adjustments.\" The Nationals, are just 4 \u00bd games right behind them nipping at their heels. There is room for improvement for sure. Hudson said after the game vs. Toronto. \"...I was battling a little bit with my delivery. My pitches weren't very crisp. I know there's some adjustments that I need to make, obviously. The results stink for me right now, but I feel confident that things are going to get a lot better.\", 38762=1/2/14: It has been well-documented how the Braves' hot start last season surprised most of the league. They rode that winning streak all season to the National League playoffs and won the NL East. That was a surprise to most experts who had the Nationals penciled in as the division champs in March. Now we have a bonafide rivalry between the two teams. Expect the Nats to play less complacent this season and for the Braves to do battle with them at every opportunity. While the Braves still have a few moves to make, one of the most important may be trading Dan Uggla, who has severely underperformed. He is still guaranteed a lot of money, so he may be tough to move., 25298=6/12/14: It is not as drastic as Jeff Smardizja with the Cubs, but Gavin Floyd had his own winless streak with the Braves - and he has pitched reasonably well. He got his first win in an Atlanta uniform, and his first win since October 3, 2012, which spanned twelve starts. This season, he had not allowed more than three runs. In four of his six starts, he let up two runs or less - giving him a solid 2.80 ERA (but no wins). Atlanta is tied with Nationals at the top of the AL East, while the surprising Marlins are only a half a game back. If Floyd can start getting some wins, then the Braves may be the team to beat again this season., 30850=4/3/14: Every team has dreams of the postseason in April, and the Braves are trying to replicate their 2013 success. The team got off to a fast start a year ago and simply owned the National League East. That was a surprise to the Washington Nationals. This season figures to be more competitive as the Braves are not going to sneak up on anyone. They did not sneak up on the Milwaukee Brewers on opening day, as the Atlanta bats fell silent in a 2-0 loss. It will be interesting to see how the Braves do pitching-wise this season, as they have already lost 40% of their expected starting rotation to injury., 33197=3/6/14: The Atlanta Braves came to terms with Cuban catcher Yenier Bello in a deal that includes a signing bonus and an invitation to spring training. Bello has had an interesting path to the U.S. He was caught trying to escape Cuba in 2012 and his passport was revoked. He 'retired' from baseball and earned his passport back. Then he went to Ecuador, and onto Mexico, where he established residency. If you are thinking that the Braves already have a catcher, you are right. And they have a lot of depth with Evan Gattis, Gerald, Laird, Christian Bethancourt and Ryan Doumit. Bello will go to the minors and work his way up., 13335=11/19/14: The Atlanta Braves remain kind of an X factor this offseason. They cruised to the NL East title 2013, and put up a good fight in 2014 until the wheels came off late in the season. Now, it looks like they are rebuilding. They reportedly are shopping catcher Evan Gattis and outfielder Justin Upton. New rumors suggest they may be willing to part with Jason Heyward. Gattis is an interesting case. He is average defensively, but has a big bat. The Braves may also be thinking about making him their everyday left fielder, which seems odd in its own right. In reality, they may not need to rebuild, just rehab. They had a lot of quality pitchers throw out their arms last season, so maybe they should focus on that first.}",
