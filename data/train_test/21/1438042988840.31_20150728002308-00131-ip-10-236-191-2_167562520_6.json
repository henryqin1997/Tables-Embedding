Prior to the events at the Five Kage Summit, Kankur\u014d recovered Sasori's body to replace his usual puppets. It seems that some modifications have been made to his body since Sasori's death, although it is unknown if certain mechanisms were previously installed, but were not shown prior to Sasori's death. Using Scorpion to fight the reincarnated Sasori, Kankur\u014d manages to give Sasori closure by stating he achieved his immortality through all the puppets he made. At the time of his death, Sasori had not yet captured his assigned tailed beast. A short dialogue between himself and Deidara suggested that Sasori did not even know what beast he had been assigned to target.[22] However, after his death, Tobi took his place as Deidara's new partner and his ring in Akatsuki, and, later, he captured the Three-Tails, thereby suggesting that the beast was Sasori's target. The symbol Sasori placed on the puppets he created.",
    "textAfterTable": "Trivia Sasori (\u880d) means \"scorpion\". Sasori had the same birth date as Masashi Kishimoto. Additionally, his birth date (November 8) makes Sasori's Western astrological sign Scorpio, the scorpion. His full alias of the Red Sand in addition may carry connotations directed to the planet Mars, traditional ruler of the sign. According to the databook(s): His hobby was remodelling his puppet collection. Sasori wished to fight Monzaemon Chikamatsu. Sasori doesn't need food. Sasori had completed 72 official missions in total: 5 D-rank, 12 C-rank, 16 B-rank, 29 A-rank, 10 S-rank. Sasori's favourite phrase was \"Eternal beauty\" (\u6c38\u4e45\u306e\u7f8e, Eiky\u016b no Utsukush\u012b). Sasori had one of the longest battle times in the anime (8 full episodes), giving him roughly about 3 hours of battle screen-time. In the first poll he was in (the 6th overall poll), he placed 6th on the list.[23] In the second poll, he placed 8th.[24] Sasori made a brief appearance in the Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 129 omake, walking past Sakura Haruno and Naruto Uzumaki in a festival, glancing at the former. Most of Sasori's puppets wore the same clothing: a black cloak with a ruffled collar except his puppets",
