            "I love seeing the campus safety officers. They are always busy, and do routine dorm checks each night, not individual rooms but each building.",
            "Keuka does not have Greek Life.",
            "The on campus clubs are a lot of fun. Up Til' Dawn is a campus club. We do fundraisers to earn money for cancer research for St. Judes and the school has a lot of educational clubs related to majors to prepare for your career.",
            "Anyone looking for a good, challenging but not too challenging, education should try to get in. The school does not base acceptance on test scores unless you want them to.",
            "Keuka has a family weekend every September. It's great to see the way the school keeps the families involved.",
            "During good weather you can swim in the lake, there are daily shuttle runs into Penn Yan, and the clubs on campus are a lot of fun.",
            "The Terrace has great food and the Geiser has it's days. It's better to get to the Geiser while the food is fresh. Everything is homemade.",
            "The dorms are very comfortable and as long you get a good roommate you are in good shape.",
            "The classes can be difficult at times but it is good preparation for our careers.",
            "It may be expensive but apply as soon as you get the chance because the campus is beautiful and the courses are definitely worth the cost.",
            "Keuka is an amazing school. Not only are we students here at Keuka friends, but we are a family. The professors here are not just professors, they are the people we look up to."

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Like any college, work is a must. Being here, it is easy to get distracted to be sure to have strong will power but be sure not to get too overworked. Also, Get involved! Being in a small environment, you get noticed for what you do! So be sure to do stuff. Bang for the buck You will not get views or community like this in many places. People are so close to each other and the area is breathtaking. The college is also great for diversity and small town values. Because of the yearly Field Periods, you can get your foot in the door for careers when you graduate, which you won't find anywhere else, making this requirement priceless! Am enjoying being here You may think Keuka is in the middle of nowhere, but that is far from the truth. Yes, Keuka is in the heart of farm country, but there are many ways to enjoy yourself. With the open space of the country, the small activities can be made quite extravagant. Also, the school is only 45 minutes to any major city like Ithaca or Rochester. The views are amazing due to the college being right on Keuka College, and the area is bustling in the summer and spring months.",
