Everyone held their breath after Maurkice Pouncey left early with an injured ankle, but as we have seen time and time again this season, the next man up did the job. Without much drop off as well. Jonathan Scott was channeling his inner Max Starks on Sunday and played his best game of the season by far. Chris Kemoeatu had his struggles, but was not awful. Flozell Adams and Ramon Foster made some nice creases and turns in the game and overall the pass protection was very strong on the night. The Jets are not a ferocious pass rush defense and often times choose to use extra bodies in coverage instead of getting after the quarterback. The Steelers were running pretty much at will in the first half and had the Jets way off balance. As the offensive line had to wait through several long Jet drives in the 2nd half, they seemed to get a bit sluggish and not as near as dominate as they were in the first half. Below is the play by play break down of the offensive line from the Sunday AFC Championship Game versus the New York Jets. It is merely a pass or fail grade on if I think the lineman did his job or not.
