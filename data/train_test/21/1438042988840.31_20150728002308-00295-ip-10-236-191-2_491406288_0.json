Farmers also have legal representation approved by the Court, in keeping with Class Action procedure. These attorneys are Robert Abrams, Baker and Hostetler, LLP, of Washington, D.C., PH. 202-861-1500 (Independent Farmer Subclass); and Brewer and Terry, PC of Morristown, TN, PH. 423-587-2730 (DFA Settlement Subclass). Farmer/Producers with questions should contact these attorneys with any questions., 10875=This email will not address the core issues which led to the Settlement, but the main thing to remember at this moment is that a large pool of money is available for distribution back into our local southeast rural and farm communities. The official Claims Administrator, Rust Consulting, must receive claims forms by May 1st, so time is of the essence. If your organization permits, I would ask that this email and be shared with your individual networks. Too, if producers ask, it would be great if you could print and share the forms., 9087=In order to complete the Claims Form above, a producer will need to fill out a block asking for milk produced in the Class defined period from January 1, 2001 to present. Many farmer/producers are using past milk check payment stubs to gather this information, or will be provided that by their milk co-ops or handlers, likely this week.}",
