            "UTB has a building called student union and they have pool tables and couches for students to relax with in between classes. Many students go to the caf\u00c3\u00a9s and purchase snacks and other goodies. The campus also has a Starbucks located in the Barnes and Noble bookstore for the student's caffeine needs.",
            "The school has two caf\u00c3\u00a9s located on different side of the campus. The food choices are abundant from pizza to sandwiches and cookies and muffins. The student union cafe has great pizza.",
            "I do not love at the dorms but they are nice. They are about 5 minutes from the main building if you are walking. Driving to and from the dorms to campus takes less than 2 minutes.",
            "The classes here are tough and must be taken serious. Some professors have extra credit opportunities and some do not.amy of the professors are on ratemyprofessor.com and some students have written reviews about them.",
            "Take school seriously and dedicate your life to your studies. Get to know professors so they know who you are and can write you a letter of recommendation later on when you need one. Join a club and get involved in the community.",
            "UTB is a great university filled with knowledgable professors and staff. There are plenty of jobs on campus for students. The opportunities for studying abroad and internships are endless."

For example, Charro Days is a very fun and exciting festival we celebrate at the end of February each year. Students are actually out of school for a couple of days due to this holiday. We have parades, small concerts, carnivals, and many more stuff. This area is highly influenced by the Mexican culture since we are only five minutes away from Mexico., 134920=Yes, students would be curious as to how and why these practices take place. Also, we get to have three mini carnivals, two circuses, and quite a few parades in town. Parades are around mid February and the other parade in December., 272323=The University of Texas at Brownsville, has a very important place in my life, it means the opportunity for a better tomorrow. Nowadays,it is extremely important to have a college degree or technical certification, in order to find a well paid job. I would describe my life in two phases, before and after UTB, my life is better unfortunatelly, I didn't had the money to attend last semester Spring 2013, but hopefully I can attend this Fall 2013., 338562=There are tons of activites and charity organizations on campus! We have outdoor movie nights with free munchies, parties at the doorm pool, and something us ocelots like to call Orange Crush. It is a party the first week of school with games, free food, music, and many other things. Not to mention, we have the 2013 NAIA Volleyball Champions!, 203430=I personally don't live at the dorms, but they used to be an amazing apartment complex that I used to constantly be at, and it was built in 2011., 399742=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

UTB is very relaxed and everyone gets along with everyone else here. It's not unpleasant. Bang for the buck Considering that tuition isn't all that expensive in comparison to other colleges in Texas, it saddens me to say that yes. You do get your money's worth! Am enjoying being here This campus isn't all too exciting as far as student life goes. There aren't too many organizations to join and the ones that ARE on campus, aren't very exciting. The dorms",
