The parallel event that I presented Studio at was LISA 2010 where Solaris 11 Express was introduced in a full-day summit to SysAdmins (you can find all the slides here) . Don and I talk about optimizing for Oracle Sun systems, being the compiler/tool of choice for a significant part of Oracle stack (DB, Peoplesoft, Siebel, JD Edwards, Hyperion, Java, NetBeans are all built using Studio) and how Studio uses and supports Solaris 11 Express features., 37430=2010 was an eventful year for most of us in the Sun Systems group as we transitioned from Sun into Oracle. The year has turned out to be good for Oracle and for Sun systems, as Oracle capitalized on innovative new technologies from Sun and provided healthy profit margins to the mothership. Today, Oracle and Sun systems stand solidly on a sustainable business model based on robust, performant Engineering systems (eg. Exadata, Exalogic and the newly announced SuperClusters) and we look forward to an equally creative and challenging year and to some exciting new technologies in the year ahead. On the downside, we lost a number of very talented leaders along the way and their creativity and energy will be sorely missed.}",

As Sun integration into Oracle progressively \"matures\", the differences between Sun's approach to product management and Oracle's approach are becoming clearer. Sun customers need a transition path to get to the Oracle model, so I am hoping that the following table is a useful way to capture these differences.

    "textAfterTable": "\\*Comment: The distinction I was trying to draw between Studio licenses and other Oracle SW is this: You can use Oracle SW freely in development environments but using it in a deployment (aka production) environments requires a support contract. eg. you can use Solaris freely to develop applications, but if you want to put it on production systems, you need a support contract. As opposed to this, Studio can be used freely both on development and production systems and you can also ship the runtime libraries that are licensed with Studio in your applications and deploy those applications. You need a support contract if you need support services and/or to download patches. See the following for more details http://www.oracle.com/us/support/development-tools-080025.html I should add that this isnt the official word on this, just my interpretation of it; many of the links posted here are indeed the official sites to go to for this information and should provide the necessary channels for this purpose.
