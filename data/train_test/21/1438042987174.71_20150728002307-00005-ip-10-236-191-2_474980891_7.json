    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{5923=Another enzymatic method for the attachment of a peptide acceptor to an RNA molecule involves the modification of the 3\u2032 end of the RNA followed by ligation using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, for example, as shown in FIG. 2. The TdT reaction is carried out as generally described in Sambrook, Fritsch, & Maniatis (supra). This enzyme extends the 3\u2032 end of nucleic acids with deoxy- (or dideoxy-) nucleotide triphosphates. These (d/dd)NTPs may be chemically modified on their base moieties to carry the desired linker structures (as described, for example, in Meyer, Methods in Molecular Biology, Agrawal, ed., vol 26, Totowa: Humana Press, 1994, pages 73-91; Kumar et al., Anal. Biochem. 169:376, 1988; Riley et al., DNA 5:333, 1986; and Schmitz et al., Anal. Biochem. 192:222, 1991). As shown in FIG. 2, the linker molecule must initiate with a (d/dd) NTP. The remainder of the linker composition, however, may vary. A special feature of this terminal transferase ligation method is that the DNA linker region of the peptide acceptor can be as short as one (d/dd)NTP unit.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{23974=This application is a divisional of U.S. Ser. No. 09/619,103, filed Jul. 19, 2000, which claims the benefit of the filing date of provisional application, U.S. Ser. No. 60/145,834, filed Jul. 27, 1999, now abandoned, all hereby incorporated by reference., 93516=For all of the strategies described above, it is preferable to optimize the linker construct. Factors to be considered, for example, are the potential inclusion of template/target recognition elements and the steric accessibility of attached functional groups. Particularly when template or target recognition through nucleic acid hybridization is involved, factors including the target sequence and the chemical nature of the linker are preferably optimized. For example, RNA hybridization strength and consequently ligation efficiency are known to be increased by the use of 2-OMe RNA or propyne-modified nucleobases, rather than DNA (as described, for example, in Inoue et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 15:6131, 1987); Kibler-Herzog et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 19:2979, 1991; and Wagner et al., Science 260:1510, 1993)., 31940=In still another aspect, the invention features methods for the selection of a desired protein or nucleic acid using the RNA-peptide acceptor molecules of the invention. The selection techniques utilize the present molecules for RNA-protein fusion formation, and subsequent selection of proteins or nucleic acids of interest. The selection methods may be carried out by any of the approaches described, for example, in Szostak et al., WO 98/31700, and Szostak et al., U.S. Ser. No. 09/247,190, hereby incorporated by reference., 92532=In one particular example, a puromycin-DNA linker may be modified with a 5\u2032 terminal amino group, which can be further converted into a chemically activated ester (e.g., an NHS-ester through reaction with disuccinimidyl glutarate or related reagents; this technique is described, for example, in Cox et al. (J. Imnuunol. 145:1719, 1990); and http://www.piercenet.com/Products/ linksearch.cfm; Pierce, Rockford, Ill.). Subsequent reaction with the PNA moiety (having either an unprotected amino-terminus or a carboxy-terminal lysine) covalently links the domains. This process may be carried out in a homogenous solution containing the final DNA-linker product, or with the DNA bearing protecting groups and remaining attached to the solid resin., 64206=In one exemplary approach, this method was carried out as follows. One nmole of RNA consisting of an RNA transcript encoding a flag epitope, a strep tag, and a photochemical target site of the sequence: 5\u2032 G GGA CAA WUA CUA UUU ACA AUU ACA AUG GAC UAC AAG GAC GAU GAC GAU AAG GGC GGC UGG UCC CAC CCC CAG UUC GAG AAG AAC GGC UAU A (SEQ ID NO:3), 1.2 nmole of Photolinker 30/10 consisting of the sequence: 5\u2032 Pso TAG CCG TTC T AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA CC Pu (SEQ ID NO:4) (where Pso is a psoralen C2 amidite [Glen Research], and Pu is Puromycin-CPG [Glen Research]), synthesized according to standard manufacturer protocols, or 30/15 consisting of the sequence: 5\u2032 Pso TAG CCG TTC TTC TCG AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA CC Pu (SEQ ID NO:5) (where Pso is a psoralen C2 amidite, and Pu is Puromycin-CPG), 10\ufffd buffer (250 mM Tris pH 7.0; 1 M NaCl), and water (bringing the final volume to 360 \u03bcl) were combined and heated to 80\ufffd C. for 2 minutes. The reaction mixture was then slowly cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture was next irradiated for 15 minutes at 0\ufffd C. with \u03bb greater than 310 nm using a 450 W immersion lamp (medium pressure; ACE Glass, cat. no. 7825-34), equipped with a Pyrex absorption sleeve (ACE Glass, cat. no. 7835-44) in a Quartz immersion well (ACE Glass, cat. no. 7854-25), with the sample in a microcentrifuge tube strapped to the immersion well, and cooled in ice-water. The sample was then precipitated with 40 \u03bcl of 3 M NaOAc and 1000 \u03bcl of ethanol, and resuspended in 75 \u03bcl of water. Next, 75 \u03bcl of 2\ufffd loading buffer (Novex) was added to the sample, and the sample was purified on a precast 6% TBE-Urea gel (Novex). The product was recovered using a crush and soak method (0.3 M NaOAc, overnight at room temperature) followed by ethanol precipitation. This photocrosslinking method yielded 272 pmole of RNA-protein fusion product using Photolinker 10/30, and 227 pmole using Photolinker 15/30., 49640=Described herein are various methods of attaching a peptide acceptor to an RNA-molecule. The RNA may be generated by any standard approach, including normal cellular synthesis, recombinant techniques, and chemical synthesis, and includes, without limitation, cellular RNA, mRNA libraries, and random synthetic RNA libraries. The peptide acceptor (for example, puromycin) is typically bonded to a DNA or RNA linker. Such peptide acceptor molecules may be generated by any standard technique, for example, the techniques described in Roberts and Szostak (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:12297, 1997), Szostak et al. (WO 98/31700), and Szostak et al., U.S. Ser. No. 09/247,190. Techniques for carrying out each method of the invention are now described in detail, using particular examples. These examples are provided for the purpose of illustrating the invention, and should not be construed as limiting., 66195=For this photocrosslinking method of chemical ligation, various parameters of the reaction were evaluated. First, the salt dependence of the photocrosslink formation was tested. A set of crosslinking experiments with buffers containing 100-1000 mM NaCl were performed. No difference in ligation efficiencies were observed between the various reactions. In addition, a change of the RNA target sequence to: 5\u2032 . . . GAC UAC AAG GAC GAG GCA UCC GCU CUU UCA CUA UA (SEQ ID NO:6) (with the underlined sequence being a target for the psoralen linker) gave significantly reduced product yields (15 to 20% reduced), indicating that the RNA target sequence was important. Next it was determined that the product yield could be increased by the repeated replacement of psoralen linkers that had been inactivated during the course of the reaction. This experiment was carried out as follows. The RNA, linker, and 10\ufffd buffer were combined and-heated to 80\ufffd C. for 2 minutes. The reaction mixture was then slowly cooled to room temperature and irradiated as described above. Then an additional 1 nmole of linker and 1 \u03bcl of buffer were added. The linker annealed to the RNA and was then irradiated. This process was repeated, by adding 2 nmole of linker and 2 \u03bcL of buffer and irradiating. This procedure allowed an increased product yield from 20% to greater than 40% for certain sequences.}",

The linkers may also be optimized for their effectiveness in the RNA-protein fusion reaction. This will generally involve varying the length of the linker, but may also involve the use of different building blocks for RNA-protein joining. In one particular example, the deoxynucleotides of the linker may be replaced with PEG-spacers or 2-OMe-RNA units (both from Glen Research, Sterling, Va.). For all of the strategies described above, it is preferable to optimize the linker construct. Factors to be considered, for example, are the potential inclusion of template/target recognition elements and the steric accessibility of attached functional groups.
