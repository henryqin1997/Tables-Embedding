The Suwannee River rose to record flood levels, dozens of sinkholes developed, businesses and homes were flooded and roads became impassible. Of the 1,500 families flooded out of their homes \u2014\u00a0 many still cannot return home, water remains up to the windows in some homes while mold slowly destroys everything inside. The flood touched more than 10,000 other people throughout the three-county area. \u00a0\u00a0 The Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park is located at 3076 95th Drive 4.5 miles north of Live Oak, Fl off US 129 at the famous Suwannee River. The park is 4.5 miles south of Interstate 75 and 4.5 miles north of Interstate 10 off US 129. Keep an eye out for the SOSMP sign and white painted board fence! \u00a0}",
