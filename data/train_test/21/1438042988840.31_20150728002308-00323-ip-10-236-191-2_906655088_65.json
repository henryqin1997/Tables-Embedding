            "You can enjoy the many weekly festivities! One prominent one being Set Friday where vendors come out and you can shop while they play music. Each week the sororities and fraternities as well as various groups around campus have events going on to raise awareness or just mingle! Never a dull moment!",
            "The cafe has a upstairs and downstairs. You can choose take out from the vedors like pizza hut and Wow Chicken wings or head upstairs to the full buffet! In the buffet they have everything from subs, soups and salads to desserts and 3 course meals to choose from!",
            "Everyone has to live on campus the first year. I lived in the apartment styled dorms and loved it! All the new people you meet is invigorating! The dorms always have activities so there is never really a dull moment!",
            "I am a graphic design major and for incoming students it may be a bit challenging. Software is continuously updating and at FAMU you can tell they try to keep up with technology. Spending a few extra hours a week practicing always will make it easier.",
            "Tip one: Get to know your teachers! They are always willing to stay and help you with what ever it is you need.",
            "I find it to be a university that believes greatly in unity. Most events on campus are always surrounded by us getting to know each other and moving ahead as one. I haven't seen a university to care so much about me as a person in my life!"

It was founded October 3rd, 1887, 346996=When you start getting into your majors your professors expect you to buckle down and do what you have to do. When a paper or an assignment is due by 11:59 by a certain day make sure you turn it in then. Unlike high school teachers professors here will not baby you, and will expect you to go by your syllabus to find out when things are due because you wont be told or reminded., 319970=The set- Right in front of Diamond & McGuinn and the H. Manning Efferson building. When ever some says I represent all FAMUans say Florida Agricultural & Mechanical University October 3rd, 1887. Whhatt??? in unison. It's crazy and it fills you with pride., 737073=The brand new co-ed dorms will be open and ready starting from the 2014-2015 school year. Weekly are room inspections making sure your room is tidy. Dorms have building wide movie nights and socials., 520432=We offer a service call the safe team which i really love, they run from 10:00 to 3am and if your walking anywhere on campus they'll come pick you up in a golf cart and take you where you need to go,its awesome., 130684=Florida A&M University, (FAMU) is considered highly among Historically Black Colleges/ Universities. In 1997, FAMU recieved the award of College of the Year, which was presented by the Princeton Review and Time Magazine.

And that means more excitement for all Rattlers in Rattler Nation., 790924=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 275542=Florida A&M University has a very skewed image in the public media. Coming here you get a completely different experience then what is expected. FAMU is one of the nations top HBCUs but it's also way more than that. It is a university who prides themselves on the success of their students. Like every school there are students who come here just to play around. The majority of us who continue their education here at FAMU are dedicated to our studies. If you are ready to be part of something great and rich with history. You are ready to be a part of Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, established 1887. When the dark clouds gather on the horizon, When thunder and lightening fill the sky ......... You must always remember that the RATTLERS WILL STRIKE, AND STRIKE AND STRIKE AGAIN!, 492570=Florida A&M is one of the best universities that has been establish since 1887.
