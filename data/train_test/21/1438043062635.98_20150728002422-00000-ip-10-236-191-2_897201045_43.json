            "While St. Louis has one of the highest crime rates in America campus safety is really cracking down. Muggings and violence are becoming less common on campus as the Department of Public Safety is hiring on more personell to man the campus after dark.",
            "There are so many clubs on campus that it would be impossible to name them all. If a group of five or more people are interested in starting up a club, SLU makes it happen. However, finding out and getting active in these clubs requires some research.",
            "If you are a hard working student who prefers a Christian education SLU is the #1 place for you. In addition, if you are seeking out a city school with many events to attend while going to a top notch school, I would highly recommend SLU.",
            "Some days half of class is cancelled due to Catholic holidays.",
            "SLU is very pricey, however the top not academics and beautiful campus help justify that pricetag. I would recommend SLU to others, especially the Physical Therapy program.",
            "SLU is located in the heart of St.Louis. I often take a free visit to the zoo, history museum, art museum, or Forest Park on the weekends with friends. There is also an abundant amount of music and theater events going on year round.",
            "There are fast food options and healthy options offered at SLU's campus. However, repetition tends to be the downfall as many of the dining facilities serve up the same food on a weekly basis.",
            "The freshman dorms are good at keeping the entire building up to date on campus events. However, once you move into upperclass housing the flow of information tends to come to a halt unless you actively seek it out.",
            "The DPT program and many other SLU programs are very rigorous. I plan out my entire week over the weekend to ensure I get all of my work done on time, while still making time for destress activities such as visiting with friends and working out. On average I study at least 3 hours a day.",
            "Incoming freshman use a planner! Write every assignment, paper, and test down as soon as you receive a syllabus. Also, venture into new study methods--utilize your classmates. Don't be afraid to have some fun as you discover your newfound independence but keep yourself grounded. Find friends with common study habits and extracurriculars as yourself.",
            "SLU is a top notch school that really focuses on keeping their students healthy physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. The academics are regularly top rated nation wide. SLU works to provide stress reduce and alcohol free events to balance out daily student life."

A large portion of the student body volunteers with their floors or student organizations and spends the day doing service somewhere in the community., 39968=When I first started school in August, I thought SLU would be boring...all about the academics. Although almost everyone is very academically focused, this school is so much fun too! I'm a commuter student as well which can be tough, but they really make an effort to reach out and get everyone involved. From soccer games to community breakfasts and Greek rush week, everything is soooo enjoyable!, 94907=I could not praise the programs here more. I had no idea what my majors entailed before coming to SLU and the extent that each would reach. The classes have a great 13:1 student-teacher ratio so I get one on one time with teachers, making the learning environment even better. I'm in my sophomore year and feel like I've already learned more here than I did in 4 years of high school., 383049=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 3567=Saint Louis University it is my favorite place to be in the world! All the people I have met here are caring and wonderful people. I can't imagine attending any other college because I believe that not only the academics wouldn't compare, but the environment in which you are in on and off campus is second to none. My new friends I've made I know will be life long friends that I will stay in touch with no matter where life takes me. We all have helped each other out and continue to do so, not because we have to, but because our floor has become a community. We look out for each other where ever we go and because of this, Saint Louis University is so enjoyable. I've heard similar stories from all of my other friends in different residence halls so it is not a isolated case. I believe it is because of SLU's learning communities. Learning Communities are people who live on the same floor who have similar majors and goals in life. This means that most of the people in learning communities are taking the same classes and experiencing the same hardships which makes it very easy to understand what people are going through and to help each other out. Everyone on campus is really friendly, including the professors! I stopped by my chemistry teacher's office one day because a problem on my test was not graded correctlyand we ended up talking for over and hour about family, gravity, and zero degrees Kelvin! I know it sounds nerdy but it was one of the most interesting conversations I've had. The thing that got me though was he has a lecture hall full of students and he still has time to talk to me for an hour and the only reason the conversation ended was because I had to head to work! The off campus experience is just as amazing. There are plenty of things to do in the city of Saint Louis and SLU students get discounts on many of the nearby performing arts centers such as Powell Symphony Hall and the Fabulous Fox Theatre. At Powell Hall SLU students can get $90 tickets for $10! The metrolink is also nearby which takes you to pretty much anywhere in Saint Louis that is worth visiting. This includes Forest Park (which is the largest park in the world). Forest Park houses the Muny which is the biggest outdoor theatre in the world! I've been to shows there and they have all been so amazing and there are also free seats! So you can go have a night out without spending any money at all! There are art museums and the St. Louis Zoo in forest park also and they are free too. The only thing you have to pay for is the Metro ticket which is $2.25 each way. Can you imagine only spending $5.50 but getting to go to the Zoo, see a profession theatre show, and get to appreciate some great art? No where else can you find a deal like that. The metrolink also stops by the Delmar Loop, which houses tons of restaurants and concert venues. Pi is the best pizza place you will ever go to and I'm not the only one that thinks that, even the President has it at the White House because it is so delicious! Froyo is a frozen yogurt/ice cream restaurant that will tickle your taste buds into delight because no other ice cream shop matches Froyo. Also there is the Pageant, which is a concert venue and I saw my favorite band there! The tickets only cost $18 and I got to get as close as I wanted! There are limitless possibilities at Saint Louis University and there is always something to do on and off campus. If you come here, you're in the prime spot to make tons of great memories with new friends but also to be challenged academically., 359871=Especially good school for students going into pre-med or for students wanting to be nurses. If you want to be in the pre-med program, pay close attention to the deadline. It's in December and easy to overlook if you don't keep an eye out for it.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here I am a commuter, so getting involved on campus is very important for me. Saint Louis University really makes it easy! There are so many groups and organizations on campus: CEO Club (for aspiring execs), art clubs, musical groups and much more. As a Jesuit institution, there are many religious and community service groups on campus as well. Also, despite a lack of diversity on campus, there are many organizations for minorities, such as the Black Student Alliance, the Muslim Student Association, as well as groups for Asians and Hispanic students. Am learning a lot The classes here are great (although I am speaking from a more science-based perspective as a premed student). I took a heavy science load during my first semester, and I liked how detailed the instruction was. Most of the freshman science classes are quite large, so the teachers use things like projectors, microphones, PowerPoint, and RSF clickers to help students stay engaged. The grading curve makes things even better! The lectures can become a little boring, though, and it can be a challenge to stay engaged during classes; however, they are only fifty minutes long, and they only meet three times a week, so it isn\u2019t that bad. The labs, which run almost three hours, are quite different. Although they are quite long, they seem",
