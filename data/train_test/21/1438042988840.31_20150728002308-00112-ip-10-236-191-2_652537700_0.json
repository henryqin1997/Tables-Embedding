You just can''t play complacently against a team the caliber of JCJC.\"It was an eye opener for us.\"In the men''s game, Jones County''s Nick Peden scored in the opening nine minutes of the contest to put the Bobcats up 1-0, but freshman midfielder Jacob Foulon of Pearl River Central knotted things up with a goal some 18 minutes before the intermission.That stalemate remained intact until freshman midfielder Curtis Sangbarani of Aberdeen, Scotland, kicked in the game-winning goal at the 19:05 mark of the second half.Peden had an opportunity to put the Bobcats up some eight minutes earlier, but missed on a penalty kick.After a six-day layoff, North foe Hinds visits PRCC Monday, Sept. 20, for 2 p.m. (women) and 5 p.m. (men) non-division games, then it''s back to South Division play when Copiah-Lincoln visits Wednesday, Sept. 22, for 5:30 p.m. (women) and 7:30 p.m. (men) contests., 16770=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2013 by Pearl River Community College.
