            "Miami Dade has it's usual clubs, SGA and cultural clubs, etc. In addition to those, in Spring 2012 Homestead Campus added a Journalism Club to the list. The Journalism Club writes articles for the local South Dade News Leader and is very interested in getting it's members published. It's a great club.",
            "Everyone. There are older people who are trying to start a new career, new students who are trying to get a cheap A.A. Degree, people who haven't been to school in a while and are trying to get their feet wet. Miami Dade is for everyone.",
            "Yes! Definitely! The price for classes cannot be beat. It's half the price of a traditional 4-year college and there are great teachers and resources available. Miami Dade College is definitely worth the money.",
            "There are a lot of on campus activities. The various school clubs are always having cultural festivals and gatherings on campus. They offer free food and drink and there is music; it's a truly fabulous time.",
            "I've only eaten at the Homestead Campus but they have decent food. Because the college is not a live in school the cafe does not really carry anything more than a quick bite to eat; although, they have added a new Chick N' Grill restaurant in the cafe.",
            "If I could I would put not applicable because there is no dorm life. Miami Dade College is a commuter college.",
            "Many people think just because this is a 2-year college it's a breeze, well it's not. Your classes will force you to pay attention and learn. If you just want the to be able to say I'm going to college, Miami Dade is not for you.",
            "Be early, early, early!!! Apply for financial aide early. Sign up for your classes early. Before you sign up for a class check the professor on ratemyprofessor.com trust me it works wonderfully. Don't procrastinate; just because this is mostly a 2-year college doesn't mean you can just slack off and not do anything. If you do that you will fail I promise. Get used books when possible and rent if you can, it saves a lot of money. Also, take advantage of the tutoring and labs and stuff. There are English tutors to help you with you papers, a Math Lab and, at least on Homestead Campus, an Open Lab for some of the science classes.",
            "Miami Dade is amazing; the teachers are helpful and funny. Use ratemyprofessor.com it works. The campus is fun and there are a lot of activities throughout the year."

The school has even gotten recognized by President Obama in 2011 at a graduation ceremony. I found that to be very remarkable!, 207934=Miami Dade College has helped me a lot and I have only attended for one semester. I have learned and improved immensely in mathematics. I first scored into a remedial math class and Im currently about to start MAT1033. Their math lab is the best, the people there are always willing to go the extra mile to help you succeed., 969027=Miami Dade has it's usual clubs, SGA and cultural clubs, etc. In addition to those, in Spring 2012 Homestead Campus added a Journalism Club to the list. The Journalism Club writes articles for the local South Dade News Leader and is very interested in getting it's members published. It's a great club., 199780=Ok, college isn't cheap. People thinkn that Dade is cheap; however, it is reasonable for 4 classes at about 1200 (not books included). Sure other schools are charging a fortune for a class, but it is enough to at least get started and save up for other terms and transfering schools., 1081007=I have been a student with Miami Dade College since 1997. It has been a rough road but they haven't given up on me and I them. To say this unbiased they are a 8 out of 10.}",
