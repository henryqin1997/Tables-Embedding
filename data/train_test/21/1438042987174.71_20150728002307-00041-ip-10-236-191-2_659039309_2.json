(Tuesday July 28 2015), 36535=Pompey's 'renewed' efforts to sign Fredi Kanoute will have to be at a higher price than the \u00a35.5m offer already 'rejected'. But Harry Redknapp and Pompey will not give up in their quest yet. Redknapp has tracked the striker for most of the summer, but has had little luck in adding him to the squad as yet, although others - strikers - have arrived dispelling any worries that we might be left with what we had. The belief, only a couple of weeks ago was Sevilla would not let him go for anything less than \u00a310m, it is now claimed they will not let him go for anything less than \u00a38m so this 'will not let him go for anything less than' amount is dropping. Paying out a large sum for a player who is almost 30 and not exactly prolific will ensure Sevilla does not get the extortionate amount they are looking for though. Some rumours circulating are that Pompey have offered Lomana LuaLua as part of the deal, so if this is true then as much as I would like to see LuaLua stay, if it is best for everyone for him to go then my thinking is this is a deal that is still very likely to happen. Should we end up signing Kanoute, even if we keep LuaLua, we would still be left light on attacking options when the African Nations comes around, so another non African could still arrive, if not now in January - unless Redknapp feels, as I think he could do, that Niko Kranjcar could fill the void for a few weeks, if not as an out and out attacker as an attacker just dropping off David Nugent. Whatever happens on the Kanoute trail, I feel sure that we have not yet seen the end of our summer spending. PLAY UP POMPEY!, 32832=Date:Friday July 20 2007, 14131=No-one's PFC position is safe!
