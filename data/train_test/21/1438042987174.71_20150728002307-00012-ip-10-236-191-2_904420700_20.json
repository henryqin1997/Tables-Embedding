            "Students that want to attain a very good education that will make them more marketable when they graduate; while still having fun. Like I said it is a fun campus with lots to do, and it is also a well respected institution, so if you find the balance between work and play, then you are sure to be successful here at the U of M.",
            "My tip for prospective students is this, don't allow the life of the city or the campus distract you from your studies. I did on occasion and it made me have to do more catching up than I would have liked to do, but it was a learning process being my first year. So if you don't get the material, get help and try to avoid putting things off until the last minute. On the flip side, this is a great campus that has lots of fun things to do, so get out there and have some fun. Be sure to get involved and try to enjoy your college years. There will be plenty of time to be 100% serious when you are working, and married with children.",
            "It is quite pricey to attend this college. Though they say there is reciprocity between Minnesota and Wisconsin, the U of M tends to save many of its scholarships for its hometown students, which can pose a financial problem for many students. As it has for me.",
            "I'm a person who loves being in big city's so I feel that the location of this school is perfect. It is a simple light rail ride away from one of the largest malls in the world, and it is located in the heart of Minneapolis. It is right by dinkytown, and downtown, and just about everything that you will want or need is on or right near campus. There are lots of people and a huge diversity of people so you are sure to find people that you like and a crowd that you fit into. No need to conform to what you think is popular here.",
            "Being one of the top Universities in the nation in many aspects: business, psychology, etc. you are guaranteed to learn a lot here. The teachers are great and the TAs that I had were all helpful. It is a great school for academic progress and learning."

However, make sure to apply before the priority deadline, usually in early December. Look up additional scholarships on the website., 43041=It is best to apply early to the University, usually before their priority deadline in mid December. Your application will be viewed early and as a result given a better chance to be accepted into your college of choice and potential for University scholarships. After choosing to attend to the U of M, it is definitely worth it to live in the dorms for the first year. In the dorms, you have the opportunity to meet alot of people while getting adjusted to campus life. Also, don't worry if you are nervous. Everyone else is in the same boat you are. Just be yourself and be open to new things. It is definitely beneficial to go to class. It may be tempting to just skip some classes, but you will likely find that you will miss more material that you imagined. Also, don't be afraid to meet your professors. They actually like to get to know their students and it can come in handy later when you need a reference or letter of recommendation. Finally, get involved! You will have fun doing something you like while also meeting people. These people may become great friends later on or lead you to someone who can help you down the road in life., 147194=I can't think of a single student who found the academic rigor at the U of M to be lacking. Some courses will naturally be easier than others (especially 1000-level ones); however, those will be worth fewer credit hours in order to reflect that. Also worth iterating is the fact that the common misconception of science and math classes being more difficult is not necessarily true here; as a foreign language major, I can attest to the fact that As are not just handed out willy-nilly. All subject areas require work; there are no easy majors\u00e2??., 999561=The University of Minnesota is a very good school, it is ranked one of the top 10 research universities when I started attending in 2005. The classes are quite large and so you would need to develop a very healthy studying schedule to keep up with course work. That or you can visit the professors during office hours., 36546=The class content depends a bit on what the class is. Especially for first-year classes (1000 level), there are the joke classes that only require a bit of realizing what the professor wants. Good news (maybe...?), however, is that this changes a lot with higher level courses (starting even with the 2000 level ones). All of my professors so far do know their material; when signing up for classes during orientation, try to get into more advanced classes and to pick professors that have won the Morse Award or some other designation. All of that said, what someone learns depends mostly on that person's effort put into the class., 413694=On the East Bank of the Minneapolis campus we have the Weisman Art Museum. This building stands out from any other building on campus because of its postmodern architecture. It was just reopened in the fall of 2011 after it underwent a major expansion project. The museum now has many more works of art on display than it ever had before., 929488=I'd definitely give the University a 9.5 out of 10. I've actually been living here since the beginning of June and honestly I feel welcomed everyday I'm here. The University of Minnesota is full of fun, energetic, and friendly people that make up the rate 9.5, 347397=just a warning: the light rail won't be done until 2015 which blocks off all of washington ave., 770830=There's lots of cheap dates. There's a telescope on the physics building that is free to use after 8 o'clock and they show free movies in one of the buildings before the movies come out on video., 1062419=There are crime alerts that go on and it is very convenient that the university will text you on your phone and email you. Also you can call someone walk with you at night if you feel unsafe, you just call an escort. In addition there is the Gopher Chauffeur that takes calls till 2:00 AM., 929067=If you want to get into the University of Minnesota feel proud. The U of MN had 43,000 applicants for the incoming class of 2017, and only 5500 applicants were accepted. Definitely take your application seriously and meet every deadline.}",

Seriously, it might sound cliche, but whether you are all about studying and keeping the grades up in hopes to go far, or are just testing the waters and taking some classes, coming back from years off of school, or just winging it... there are a million more students just like you and life on and around campus has stuff for everyone :) Tips for prospective students I was so scared as an incoming freshman, because nobody from my high school or town lived in the cities, so I thought I would never meet anyone. Believe me, when you get to school it is so easy to meet and get along with everyone on campus, and you can't let yourself worry for one second. Everyone",
