            "First Friday and different sorority/fraternity week are cool. If your heart desire to join a frat or sorority then do. It builds your network and allows you to create a life long bond.",
            "You must get involved in clubs activities. They are a great way to meet people and build your network. Students thrive off of networking at HU.",
            "Dedicated, social, hard-working, determined, smart and bright",
            "Walking to Howard China (HoChi) after parties for chicken and Mumbo sauce. Or staying late in the ILab to get papers done.",
            "This school is majorly expensive!! I left because I did not want to take on all the loans. Even though I look ahead to a rewarding career, I did not want to have to deal with the many loans I would pay over a lifetime. You have to do a lot of hard and long networking to find scholarships and opportunities to succeed financially.",
            "When the weather is sunny and lovely, the yard is the place to be. The students come out as one to enjoy the sunshine. There is always a social event at clubs or thrown house parties. Or its always nice to go down to China Town watch a movie or go shopping as well as in Pentagon City.",
            "The cafe food is decent. The staff is hilarious and weird at the same time. The Punch Out used to have decent food in there when I was going there. Both are located in Blackburn and also have events in there for different activities going on around campus.",
            "Q-U-A-D!!! AWWWWEEEE YEEEEAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!! IF you are a incoming freshman you would want to stay in the dorms. They are a great way to meet new people and the RESFEST is a friendly competition to show the best dorms with talent. It is an older school without much remodeling except for the newer dorms. I stayed in Crandall Hall 2nd floor and didn't have many problems. Except losing my keys lol.",
            "The academics are not tough, but if you lose focus you can easily see yourself stressing out more than you should.",
            "Please stay focus and on top of the A Building. Also, become active around campus to obtain a better network.",
            "I love this school. The atmosphere and student relation are wonderful. The students genuinely care for each other and expect the best for you."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{279349=Howard University is know for its epic Homecoming Celebrations. The biggest celebrities, music artist, stylist and experts from around the world travel to DC to help us celebrate our Homecoming festivities in style with a week filled with traditional events such as the Gospel Show, Comedy Show, Fashion Show and ultimately the Greek Step Show and most importantly Football Game. Homecoming is in mid to late October every year! Resfest, a competition between all the dormitories is the next biggest event and tradition at Howard, after Homecoming. Teams are formed from each dormitory to compete in Debate, Sports, Strolling, Dancing and most importantly Stepping for the Resfest Champion Title., 637148=This only got two stars because of the social aspect (and there is supposed to be more dorms built within the next 10 years). Our dorms need major reparations. In order to get the best experience I advise freshman girls to live in the Quad or the Annex, freshman boys should live in Drew Hall. DO NOT live in Meridian Hill Hall, it is a sophomore dorm and will deprive you from your freshman experience because it is a sophomore dorm and it is off campus. If you get placed there, have your parents call and complain. In around February, you'll have to pay $200 if you want to live on campus the following year. There is also a dorm that is way off campus (about 30 minutes total from campus) called University Town Center in Hyattsville, MD. It is metro- accessible and if you are used to a full kitchen and living room, this is the place for you (I recommend sophomores and up)., 715738=Stay on financial information. Register for classes in April., 459026=The dorm bathrooms and hallways are cleaned everyday and all the dorms are in great shape! In Fall 2014 there will be two new dorms housing Freshman girls and Sophomores., 864142=Check your teachers on ratemyprofessor.com and if your not an early morning person stay away from 8:10 classes. It will only lead to missing class., 930308=From recent reports, the tuition has increased by a significant amount since 2012, and that is unfortunate. From my experience, Howard has not always appropriated its funds in the best way, with the majority of the money not being sewn back into the university. With that being said, although you will have at least one score to settle or obstacle created by administration in need of a major reconstruction, you will have the memories of Homecoming and your own personal Howard experience to look forward to. So, depends on how you look at it, it may be worth it., 183290=Be yourself, the rest will follow! Get involved, whatever you can get your hands on that you are good at, do it! Volunteer, join a team or club, anything. Just get involved. GO TO CLASS! Howard has a lot of distractions, you can not let the glamour and fun take you way from your main focus! Do not get caught up in the graduating on time, there is no such thing. If an opportunity presents itself for you to study abroad or do a co-op, DO IT! Even if it means adding a semester or 2. (however make sure you have the funds to cover all of your time) Go to everything 10-30 minutes early. No matter the event or class you will benefit greatly from being early (including the cafe line) Get all of your financial aid/registration started as early as possible. If FASA opens on January 1st @ 12:00am, be there to fill it out by January 1st 12:01am. Do NOT wait until the week something is due because issues always arise and you will want time to attend to it. Stay on top of financial aid office, they are not very organized at times, and they have a lot of students to handle. Unfortunately its not all about you. Go to teachers office hours, and go often!! It benefits greatly if the teacher knows who you are and sees that you are making an effort, plus its added learning time. Don't spend you whole time planing your life, that you for get to live You miss 100% of the shoots you don't take. Take risks!, 854135=Homecoming at Howard draws over 6,000 people every September. It is a two week long tradition that spawns multiple events with iconic people., 929403=Howard University is the founding home to the majority of the Divine Nine, so be prepared to see, hear, and experience tons of Black Fraternities and Sororities participating in various events like auctions and pageants in the Fall, and probates in the Spring. The biggest event on campus is Howard Homecoming, which happens typically every October. It is one of the biggest college homecoming weeks in the country. Be prepared for lots of celebrity sightings, parades, and shows. Past guests included: Chaka Khan, Tyrese, Pooch Hall, P. Diddy, Boris Kojoe,Taraji P. Henson, Wendy Raquel Robinson, and much more., 1115936=Student organizations often host parties during the school year.Dancing and socializing are definitely big, and most students do frequent a lot of hip-hop and dance clubs in the area, namely Love and Fur. Homecoming, which occurs every year in the third week of October, is a can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?t-miss event and has been known to draw hundreds of alumni and students from schools all over the country, especially other HBCUs. Even if you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?re not yet 21, you can still enjoy DC\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?s nightlife., 633747=We are the Alpha chapter for most of the black greeks. There is First Fridays in The Punchout where we get to watch them stroll/ step. Also, in April there are the Probates. We have other greeks as well that focus on your major/ minor. They are all great for networking. *Discretion is key*}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here I absolutely LOVE the environment of Howard! There are so many different people here and I've found every person I've met to be intriguing. In my dorm, there are lots of socials that students can participate in and that will help you to meet lots of people. For instance, during the beginning of the year, my RA put together a girls night where we played games and had lots of treats to eat while getting to know each other. The residence hall council knows how to keep us interested by always decorating the lobby during Homecoming and Christmas and also throw many sessions about important issues such as recycling and campus safety. Aside from the social life, Howard has LOTS of opportunities that are open to everyone. There are so many activities to join that you may find yourself in many organizations and clubs within your first two months. I absolutely couldn't imagine going to any other school! Am learning a lot Since I'm in the School of Business the curriculum proved to be challenging. I took 15 credit hours for my first semester freshman year and I could handle it. There are hundreds of classes to take and what's better is that you can choose what classes you want and which teacher which is a choice that I",
