            "I feel that the College of DuPage is very safe because nothing ever happens and there are police on campus who are helpful and always watching out for everyone.",
            "I would not know about this.",
            "There are choirs, sports like soccer, football, baseball, and more, and a ton of clubs which you can find under Student Clubs and Organizations on the COD website.",
            "This campus is good for any type of student because it is a place that is easy to get used to and it isn't too large so it isn't too intimidating.",
            "People join clubs or groups around campus and do stuff with them. The also join sports teams on campus as well. There are nice sitting areas everywhere so in-between classes, one can plug in there computer and go on the internet, watch movies or shows, or listen to music. Also, there are always people waiting outside of their classes so you can strike up conversation with them or with people in the cafeteria. I have, myself, painted in the cafeteria with my friends at a table and played cards too. There are plenty of things to do around campus.",
            "I have never eaten from the cafeteria at the College of DuPage so I would not be able to help you with that.",
            "I would not know about dorm life because I do not live in a dorm.",
            "The classes are not too difficult because certain classes have prerequisites in order to make sure that the class isn't too much for you. An example is if you get a certain score on your placement tests then that score will allow you to take certain courses.",
            "My tips for students coming to the College of DuPage are to be prepared with all the books you need for your courses on the first day, to know where your classes are before the day of, and make sure you can get there on time. This will help to keep you less stressed and make things easier in general.",
            "I think that the College of DuPage has a nice campus with teachers who are helpful. The courses are a good mix of easy and difficult which is good when you are a student. Lastly, it is very affordable and a good first college to attend."

(Think $4,000 compared to $10,000.) Tuition varies on which and how many classes you take, but the classes are set up to help you do your best and to teach you accurate information in whichever field its in. As an update, I'd like to share that this past Spring I was able to enroll in a study abroad class in Japan over spring break! The cost was only about $2700 or so, and we were able to make scheduled payments instead of paying all at one time. We went around the cultural capital, Kyoto, learning about the history and culture of the country while being guided by a professor who grew up there. It was fascinating! For the price paid, we visited many important cultural places in Japan and had a very unique and amazing experience!, 153790=I have enjoyed going to College of Dupage so far. I am looking forward to returning to College of Dupage on August 20th. I am very lucky to have the opportunity to attend this school., 110359=If students don't like to smoke then they should be happy about the no smoking on campus ban which goes into affect August 2012. There are a range of sports activities such as football and basketball for students to be apart of as well., 129050=There are tons of clubs to join that a lot of people miss out on in a community college but you should take advantage of them, especially your first year. There is also a Leadership retreat to Lake Geneva every August, it's a lot of fun., 50921=The food at the school has really improved drastically. When i first attended it in 2008 it was alright but every since they have renovated the quality has risen drastically., 294704=As I am writing this, the cost is $136 per credit hour. Along with some fees for classes, that sums up to ~$1500 for a 12 credit hour student. Pretty cheap. However, this might not guarantee quality professors., 424177=College of DuPage have a variate of food choices. In the Fall semester of 2014 they recently added a Chik-fa-la in the cafeteria., 436969=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck This is where COD really shines. Even with modest tuition hikes, the school is still affordable. I have gotten through the first two years of my BA with virtually no debt. This is one of the top accredited community colleges in the country, and the price makes it a great choice to figure out what you want to study and what you enjoy. Am enjoying being here I enjoy the fact that I am saving money. Due to the large student body, it's often hard to make new friends or feel a sense of student body cohesion. It's a commuter campus, so you don't have the opportunity of meeting people through living accommodations. They are currently renovating the campus, as well, so there is a lot of construction and noise during the day. Am learning a lot There are some really good teachers, but then there are those who really aren't the best. I've had classes in which I felt challenged, engaged, and really enjoyed it, but I've also been in one or two where the teacher teaches straight from the book, could really care less, and makes it very unenjoyable. But for the money, it's not bad.",
