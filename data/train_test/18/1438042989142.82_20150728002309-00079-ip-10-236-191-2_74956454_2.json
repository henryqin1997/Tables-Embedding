Ensure that an FTP or TFTP server is available and can be accessed via the IP address of the default gateway (rather than any other IP address on the defined subnet). Follow these guidelines when installing Cisco SAN-OS software images: Guidelines for Installations This section lists general guidelines for performing Cisco SAN-OS software installations, image upgrade and downgrade procedures, and reboots. Guidelines For documentation purposes, we use the term upgrade in this document. However, upgrade refers to both upgrading and downgrading your switch, depending on your needs. Note: Installations, upgrades, and reboots are ongoing parts of SAN maintenance activities. It is important to minimize the risk of disrupting ongoing operations when performing these operations in production environments and to",

Note: It is normal for the active supervisor to become the standby supervisor during an upgrade. Follow these guidelines when upgrading or downgrading Cisco SAN-OS software images: Read the Cisco SAN-OS Release Notes for the release you are upgrading or downgrading to. Cisco SAN-OS Release Notes are available at the following website: http://cisco.com/en/US/products/ps5989/prod_release_notes_list.html Ensure that an FTP or TFTP server is available. Copy the startup-config to a snapshot config in NVRAM. This step creates a backup copy of the startup-config. In Device Manager, choose Admin > Copy Configuration and select the startupConfig radio button for the From: field and the serverFile radio button for the To: field. Set the other fields, and click Apply. From the CLI, use the copy nvram:startup-config nvram-snapshot-config command. Where possible, choose to do a nondisruptive upgrade. In general, you can nondisruptively upgrade to Cisco SAN-OS Release 3.x software from any Cisco SAN-OS software Release 2.x or later. Review the upgrade table in the Cisco SAN-OS Release Notes for the version you will be installing. Use the show install all impact upgrade-image CLI command",
