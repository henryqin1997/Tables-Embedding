            "Make sure you go for a visit and take full advantage of your day there. Try to contact a current student to show you around one on one. A group tour might be ok if you want to see the campus, but not if you want to try to get to know the campus. Plus, a student will be able to give you a more personal insight into their experiences. With all of that in mind, be aware that the way Drexel operates is in terms or a quarter system. The average college has two semesters of around 14 or 16 weeks and a summer break. Drexel's freshman year consists of three 10 week terms equal to that of a semester and summer term off. The credits you earn on the quarter system are sometimes looked as unequal to those on a semester system by other colleges, so if you ever want to transfer it might be very difficult to do. The workload is very intense being 10 weeks as opposed to 16. Also, Drexel starts and ends later than most colleges. Drexel begins Fall term near the end of September, and Spring term ends around the second week of June, much like most high schools. Good luck on your searching!",
            "Drexel is extremely expensive, especially freshman year. On-campus housing is around 1k a month so make sure you remember to find a cheap apartment for the following years! It's very possible, and Drexel even has an off campus housing site that allows land lords to post nearby apartments. The meal plans are also very expensive but avoidable in the following years. Now, even though it is so expensive, I still give it 4 stars. The co-op program is what makes everything worthwhile. I went for engineering which has 5 year, 3 co-op program. This option spreads out the cost of attending for 4 years over 5 years which decreases the annual cost. You'll also gain a year and a half of experience in your chosen major before you graduate as well as get paid for your work (usually). Not all majors have this option, and I would recommend that you know FOR SURE that the major you chose is the major you want and the job field you want to be working in the rest of your life otherwise it is NOT worth it.",
            "Philadelphia is a great city to live in. There is always something to do, so the usual college seen is very easy to avoid. Of course there are still parties, but much less than at other schools I've visited. The Philadelphia Museum of Art (the steps Rocky ran up) is at a walkable distance, and the Zoo is also nearby. There are also plenty of concert venues I take full advantage of, cute shops in Olde City, a few parks here and there, and many historical sites like the Liberty Bell. You can't forget about the food either. Many 5 star restaurants are in the area including decadent sushi to French food along with the famous Philly cheesesteak hoggie shops and pizza from the Italian market. You can also always find a cozy coffee shop nearby, Starbucks or not. The campus life is not all bad, but I chose to explore the city instead of explore campus life so I don't have a whole lot of insight into that. There is Greek life to a small extent. I have a few friends in Lambda Chi Alpha and Delta Zeta and they enjoy themselves. The only reason I gave this 3 stars is because of all the academic stress I was put under as an engineering major freshman year. I stayed in my dorm room studying so much I didn't get to go out very often. I am trying to transfer to a difference school because I do not like being at Drexel with everything taken into account, but I adore the city and it is something a lot of people love too so I'm counting more of the city aspect of my enjoyment being here but I can't rule out the academic part entirely.",
            "It's hard to learn a lot in the atmosphere Drexel provides. The classes are very large coming from an engineering major. I struggled to get the kind of grades I was used to in high school because it was so easy to skip class or not care about the work. My roommate freshman year, however was an architecture major with around 33 people in that major. She did very well. My roommate now is a graphic design major with around 28 people in that and she does extremely well too. I think it really depends on the major you choose and how much the classes interest you to affect how well you do and how much you learn. All of the engineering majors are basically thrown into all of the same required classes freshman year (which are pretty much just math), so it's really hard to have any personal connection with any of the professors and really learn the material like you might want."

Good luck on your searching!, 2340=Right now, I am on summer vacation. I cannot wait to go back to Drexel in September. Drexel's campus is filled with fun clubs, organizations, and there's always something to do. If you tire of being on campus, the heart and soul of Philadelphia, Center City, is a short, (free) shuttle ride away., 136741=File FAFSA in January, and you will automatically get $1000 in aid from Drexel., 591407=The top floor of our main buildings has this one room that surely hasn't been touched since 1980. There's all this old tech stuff forgotten up there, which is cool to see. I always want to explore that floor more, I have a feeling there's alot more history to be found., 379117=Not so much on campus but Philadelphia has the Mummer's parade every New Year's and has a great Welcome America for fourth of July., 821129=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 747539=If you're up for the challenge, the opportunities are here at Drexel. If your interested in research, check out the STAR program for incoming freshmen. It's a paid summer internship with housing. For anyone considering attending Drexel, I would contact the department you would be considering for your major. I set up an appointment with the Electrical Engineering department when I went on the campus tour. I met with a professor and an adviser, they were great. They explained how the program worked, spoke about Drexel in general and answered all the questions my parents and I had . They gave us contact information that we used later for followup questions via email and telephone. Checkout the COOP program,COOP is what makes Drexel different. Freshman year started in 9/2012, all freshman are required to take classes to prepare for COOP. In 12/2013 I interviewed with 4 companies, got job offers from 3 and just started(3/31/14) a 6 month full-time position with SAP Solutions (the 4th largest software company in the world). It's an unbelievable opportunity. Even more unbelievable is that I get paid (I think alot), they offered me benefits, health insurance, 401K. I'm excited to learn and contribute. The other tip is something I heard from student at every school I looked at. GET INVOLVED and do it right away... club, sports, Greek life, work study job, student government, newspaper, pep band, anything.}",

Tips for prospective students In high school, work hard and get involved. Drexel University is looking for students with good grades and those that take leadership roles. If you get accepted into Drexel, I suggest to take advantage of the 5 year program, which gives you the most working experience. If you are stressed out about the price of the school and you live within commuting distance, don't be afraid to commute. I am a commuter and I feel that I still get the college experience while saving a lot of money. Bang for the buck",
