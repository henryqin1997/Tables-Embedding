            "Campus safety is very good about getting information to their students. Sometimes though it takes almost the whole day for the students to get notified about things.",
            "This is pretty much the only way you'll have fun.",
            "The clubs are okay! Kind of boring I would say just because they're very generic. The men's volley ball team is pretty good though!",
            "Students who are quick learners and aren't afraid to teach themselves a lot of information.",
            "I honestly do think my education will be worth it in the end but it's difficult to keep GPA's high enough to keep scholarships.",
            "If you aren't in Greek life, there really is not a lot to do for fun...",
            "There are three main dining halls on campus and there's really only one that has good food! The Damen dining hall is probably the best one since it seems like its food is the freshest.",
            "The dorms are pretty nice but the cleaning supplies they use to clean the bathrooms smells really bad! Kind of like moldy chlorine... And there are not enough dorm rooms for all the students!!! How does that make sense? Residence life needs to get it together...",
            "The classes at Loyola are pretty tough. The teachers expect a lot from their students and in order to do well, they expect you to do things outside the classroom.",
            "I would say that the thing prospective students need to worry about the most is staying on task. It's easy to get distracted since the city is only a train ride away. Also, getting help from your teachers is something you will definitely need to do.",
            "Loyola is a great school if you are willing to work hard! There's no slacking at this school. Also, you have to dedicate a lot of time to studying for your classes."

The best place to eat is (currently) Simpson Dining. I would advise not eating at Lakeshore Dining, except come April we won't even have Lakeshore Dining. They are opening up a brand new student center where I'm sure there will be exceptional food., 690229=Well there are the rocks by the lake that everyone loves, and the beach on warmer days to just sit and relax. An unusual tradition would be christmas on campus or the new years party that is held almost every year. The christmas on campus is self explanatory, you basically have christmas on campus! It's wonderful because everything is decorated! The new years party is in early september and its a small celebration for all the students and staff to welcome the new academic school and wish everyone good luck in their endeavors!, 801808=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 102840=Wolf and Kettle day is in March every year when we celebrate the donors of our education and those who help pay for tuition. FUN, 18578=Do not take a class at 8:30 offered at the Water Tower Campus!One of the classes I would highly recommend is Human Values in Literature with Mr. Fruhauff. Overall, try to have an open mind about courses and balance out your schedule so that it fits your needs. Do not try to do too much in one semester but do try to get involved in extra curriculars. You will not regret it.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here Loyola University was not originally my first choice for college, however, I have no regrets in choosing to attend. In fact, I believe that choosing Loyola was the best decision I could have made. I did not come here with any friends, however my Resident Assistant made it easy to enjoy activities around Chicago while meeting girls that lived on my floor! Throughout the year I found support and encouragement from both friends and teachers which helped me destress from an academically challenging schedule. It was also very easy to connect one on one with teachers because the classes were so small. Am learning a lot As a nursing student at Loyola University I was immediately enrolled in classes directly related to my major. The teachers for my nursing classes encouraged me to take initiative in getting involved early within the nursing field. They taught me that nursing is not just taking care of sick patients but taking on the incredible role of helping someone with their spiritual, mental, and physical health. Since I came to Loyola I have become extremely passionate about my chosen career due to the compassion and encouragement of faculty members and fellow students. I am truly excited to take on another year at Loyola. Login to",
