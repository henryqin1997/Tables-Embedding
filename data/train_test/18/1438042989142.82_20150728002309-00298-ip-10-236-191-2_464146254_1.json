Attended first match aged 5 v Man U 0-0 in 1967. Only remember sitting on white wall at front of Trent end waiting for game to start. First real memory Forest v Man City in 1974 in FA Cup, played on a Sunday, massive crowd and I was put over the front of the wall in the main stand. Won 3-1 I think with Duncan McKenzie in magic form. Q - What are your most memorable moments as a Forest fan? Good and Bad. Being a season ticket holder when we won the league aged 15 was special. Clough's second team in 88 etc with Pearce was pretty special too. Hillsborough - I was there - was a low. From a football perspective - Yeovil at home play off semi. Q - Since you have been following Forest, what would your best starting eleven be and who is your all time favourite player? Shilton, Anderson, Dawson, Walker, Pearce, Francis, Keane, Cohen, Robertson, Woodcock, Collymore - all time favourite Robertson or Pearce can't pick it. Q - What is your best and worst moment of the 2012/13 season? Best - Leeds at home Boxing Day Worst - Failing to score v Barnsley at home. Q - In your opinion, how have the new owners performed since taking over the club last July? Mixed - I would have stuck with SOD, even though he wasn't a big name or personality, once he was sacked, AM was a disaster. Why not bring Billy in then? Off the pitch some positives eg screens but PR still dodgy. Q - Best and worst away ground visited? Best Man U - only seen us win there too!Worst - MK Dons old ground was dire, Watford not much better. Q - Who is your Nottingham Forest player of the season? Cohen by a mile. Q- Which player(s) would you like to see Forest sign this summer (realistically)? Billy Sharp, but then play him A left back and a solid and quick centre back. Q - All seater stadia. Good thing, or a bad thing? I went to Hillsborough - no doubt a good thing. Q - What are your thoughts on how the team performed last season and how did it compare with your expectations? It started as I thought it would. We were crap under AM and suddenly we looked excellent under Billy, in the end we blew it when it was in our hands! Q - What are your expectations for next season in the Championship/Where will we finish? I think we have a really good chance of top 2. Q- Much has been said about the wealth of our new owners. Do you think they will spend their way to promotion, or adopt a more frugal approach in trying to achieve it? I think they want it and will show it this summer. Q - Name a former Forest player you were most disappointed to see sign for another club? Collymore to Liverpool. Q - What's your opinion on Billy Davies and will he bring success to the club? Mixed, great motivator, hate that he refuses to talk to radio Nottm. Could have an argument in a phone box. Q - In your opinion, was it the right or wrong decision to sack Sean O'Driscoll? Wrong at the time. Q - New stadium, or renovate the City Ground? Open to new ground if we were constantly selling out the CG, need to expand other facilities and a move may be the only way to do it. Q - If you could put one question or make one request to Mr.Fawaz Al-Hasawi, what would it be? Why appoint AM? Q - Where do you sit/stand at the City Ground? Trent End Upper. Q - Name the celebrity you would most like to meet. Jon Stewart (US Daily Show). Thanks to Steve for taking the time out to answer the questions.
