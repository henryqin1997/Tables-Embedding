The step size is \u0394t = 1/60, thus each simulation comprises n = 1200 steps., 172230=For the sake of consistency with the following sections, the numerical estimates of the parameters in wind load factor {g(t),Wm,\u03c3W} are also used here to simulate random paths, month after month, over a number of years. The third column in Table 8 comes from this Monte Carlo approach. It results from running 1000 simulations each comprising 1200 time steps (i.e., five steps per month) and then taking the average value. The amounts are very close to those in the second column., 213663=This means that we run 1000 simulations of 1200 steps at each final node. Since the option to invest is akin to a \u201ccall\u201d option we denote its value by C:, 113194=As Table 3 suggests, the periods with (statistically) highest wind generation fall in January and November. The highest prices of electricity are reached between October and March, so there is some overlapping. This time coincidence allows UK wind farm owners to obtain greater profitability from wind generation. Other papers overlook this feature [45], but our model takes it into account., 166219=The feed-in tariff is generally claimed to be the most effective method for promoting renewable energy. Let p denote the tariff applied to the electricity generated. According to Klessmann et al. [14], German feed-in tariffs in 2007 for onshore wind were 81.9 \u20ac/MWh in the initial years of the project and 51.7 \u20ac/MWh afterwards. In Spain they were 73.20 \u20ac/MWh (over 20 years) and 61.20 \u20ac/MWh from then on., 155155=Here, total cost is computed under the assumption that the fixed annual O&M cost grows at the riskless rate of return. We apply the official exchange rates from the European Central Bank on January 2012: 1 = $1.2905, 1 = \u00a30.8321. Thus, the total cost of our wind farm is \u00a396,667,000., 111185=The sample comprises the monthly ratios between output electricity and installed capacity for the whole of the UK from April 2006 to December 2010, i.e., 57 observations [42,43]. As a first step the seasonal component is taken out of the original series. Estimation then proceeds on the deseasonalized series. The estimate of the average value is \u0174m = 24.0899%; and that of the standard deviation is \u03c3W = 0.9088 [44]. The results for the (dummy) monthly variables appear in Table 3 and are shown in Figure 2., 87465=We have 26,057 prices of monthly UK Base Electricity Futures from the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE, London). The sample period goes from 1 December 2009 to 30 March 2012 thus comprising 604 trading days (see Table 1)., 175372=Under \u03c1E,W = 0.1038 the MC estimate for V is \u00a3122,262,434. With a total investment cost plus fixed O&M cost I = \u00a396,667,000, we derive NPV = V \u2212 I = \u00a325,595,434. Thus the investment is profitable under these circumstances, in particular the expected increase in the electricity price. This increase may in turn be induced by the expected path of the generation costs of marginal plants (i.e., those that set the price in the electricity market), above all those of natural gas and carbon emission allowances (which have an increasing floor level in the UK) [57]., 107762=The (annual) risk-free interest rate considered is r = 2.05%, which corresponds to the 10-year UK government debt in January 2012 (source: European Central Bank)., 70852=For each MWh of green electricity that a utility generates it receives one ROC [36]. If the utility generates more ROCs than needed to meet its obligation then it can sell the spare ROCs to other suppliers who are struggling to meet theirs via purchase agreements (it can also sell them at the quarterly auctions organized by the Non-Fossil Purchasing Agency, or through a broker for a fee). This allows them to receive a premium in addition to the wholesale electricity price. During the period 2002\u20132011 the proportion of the RO met by ROCs ranged from 56% to 76%. Those suppliers who do not have enough ROCs to cover their obligation must make a payment into the buy-out fund. This penalty or \u201cbuy-out price\u201d is set every year in the same order that establishes the RO level: it is a fixed price per MWh shortfall at which Ofgem purchases ROCs (it is adjusted every year in line with the Retail Price Index). The buy-out price has risen from \u00a330/MWh in 2002\u20132003 to \u00a340.71/MWh in 2012\u20132013. The cash inflows to the buy-out fund are later aggregated annually and recycled as an extra reward on a pro-rata basis to electricity suppliers who surrendered ROCs. The total buy-out fund thus redistributed rose from \u00a390 M in 2002\u20132003 to \u00a3357 M in 2010\u20132011., 94681=Figure 1 displays the futures prices actually observed on the last day of the sample (30 March 2012) along with those implied by our numerical estimates using all the contracts traded every day. We can estimate the spot electricity price for day t0 from the futures contract with the nearest maturity using Equation (3):, 177545=Here we assume that the wind farm owner gets a payment that is composed of the electricity price plus an extra premium for each megawatt-hour generated. For example, onshore wind projects in Spain receive a premium of 29.29 \u20ac/MWh in 2007 during their first 20 years of operation (Klessmann et al. [14]). There are, nonetheless, upper and lower limits to the total amount of the market price plus the premium: 84.94 \u20ac/MWh and 71.27 \u20ac/MWh, respectively. Again we run 1000 simulations with 1200 steps and \u03c1EW = 0.1038. Table 10 displays the results., 74919=Nonetheless, according to the UK Government ([39]), \u201cFrom 2027 the Department of Energy & Climate Change (DECC) will fix the price of the ROC for the remaining 10 years of the RO at its long-term value and buy the ROCs directly from the generators (as set out in the white paper on Electricity Market Reform and subject to parliamentary approval). This will reduce volatility in the final years of the scheme. The long-term value of a ROC is the buyout price plus 10%. This is roughly \u00a341 per ROC in 2010 prices\u201d. Therefore we propose the model:, 253217=Ambitious goals in energy and environmental issues have been set recently in a number of places. One of the latest cases involves Sweden and Norway; beginning in 2012, both countries have agreed on a common green certificate system for RES-e. It is the first European example of a bilateral collaboration between two countries to achieve a common goal with respect to renewable energy. The political signal is that wind power has a reasonable chance to be realized. However, as Blindheim [70] points out, the question remains: will investors enter the market? will they judge the profitability and risk to be acceptable?, 386006=\u00a9 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Since 2008\u20132009 the green line and the red line have looked set to converge in the future. In this regard, Table 4 shows the expectations of the three variables in 5, 10, 15, and 20 years' time., 114566=Figure 4 displays the time series of the buy-out price (Bt) from 2002\u20132003 to 2012\u20132013. Its profile has led us to model Bt as a GBM in principle. From this sample period we get the following parameter estimates: \u03b1B = 0.026298, \u03c3B = 0.013085. The drift rate is significant yet the volatility is very small. Consequently, henceforth we consider Bt as deterministic for all practical matters, i.e., \u03c3B = 0 (thus Bt and Rt are uncorrelated)., 69612=The UK government has committed to meeting a legally binding EU target of generating 15% of energy from renewable sources by the year 2020. The main financial mechanism for supporting large-scale renewable generation is the Renewables Obligation (RO): this is a market-based mechanism similar to a renewable portfolio standard. The RO places a mandatory requirement on electricity suppliers to source a proportion of electricity from renewable sources. The RO level increases every year (beginning on April 1 and running to March 30 each year); it started in 2002\u20132003 at 3% and will reach 15.8% in 2012\u20132013. Support is granted for 20 years. In April 2010, the RO end date was extended from 2027 to 2037 for new projects., 155472=The average load factor is \u0174m = 24.0899%. Seasonality must be added to this (see Table 3). Thus the expected availability in January would be \u0174m + d\u03021 = 24.0899 + 8.7442 = 32.8341%; or, in absolute terms 50 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 31 \u00d7 0.328341 = 12,214.29 MWh [54]. In general (assuming 365.25 days per year to account for leap years), wind generation over a time period \u0394t amounts to:, 122152=First we get deseasonalized monthly series of the three state variables over the period 2010\u20132011. Next we take the natural logarithms of these figures [46]. Then we compute the cross-correlations; they appear in Table 5. The correlation between electricity price and wind load is low (0.1038) [47]. That between electricity price and ROC price is not much higher (0.2008), and that between wind load and ROC price (\u22120.0071) is negligible. All the following computations draw on these correlations., 118632=The numerical estimates of the parameters are: \u03b1R = 0.02433, \u03c3R = 0.418197. From B0 = 36.99 and R0 = 10.651 we compute ROC0. The expected value is:, 186126=Using the above estimates (B0 = \u00a336.99/MWh, \u03b1B = 0.026298, R0 = \u00a310.651/MWh, \u03b1R = 0.02433, r = 0.0205) we get VROC = \u00a31003.50/MWh. Factoring in the fact that the load factor is stochastic and using the above parameter values alongside the three correlations (in Table 5) for valuing the 50 MW farm operating on average at a rate 24.0899%, MC simulation results in a cumulative subsidy from ROCs of \u00a3105,915,277. Thus the utility's total revenues from electricity price plus ROC price amount to V = \u00a3228,159,785. This sum is equivalent to a constant feed-in tariff of \u00a3131.65/MWh, and the electricity price plus a fixed premium of \u00a361.10/MWh.}",
