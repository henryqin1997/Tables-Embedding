    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Once given the disclosure, many other features, modifications and improvements will become apparent to the skilled artisan. Such other modifications, features and improvements are, therefore, considered a part of this invention, the scope of which is to be determined by the following claims. In order to move the console platform, it is necessary to drop the keyboard platform 32 to about its lowest position in order to gain access to the end of the control rod in order to release the brake 16. It is noted that since the platform 32 is suspended from the sidewalls 10 of the vertically movable support for platform 8, the platform 32 moves with platform 8 so that the relative locations of these platforms remains the same upon movement of platform 5 unless the location of platform 32 is deliberately changed. The frame members 42 have pins or posts 44 and 46, extending perpendicular to the plane of the members 40 and 42. The post 44 extends into slots 48 in side plates 40 that permit the frame member 42 to be moved forward and backwards relative to the platform 32, i.e., relative to the side plates 40. These posts 44 permit the platform 32 to be rotated about the posts 44 to change the angle (tilt) of the platform relative to the floor. The degree to which the platform may be tilted is determined by the posts 46 seated",
