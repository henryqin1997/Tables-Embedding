    "textBeforeTable": "Patentzitate It is to be understood that the various features of the present invention lend themselves to other types of PM optical fiber connectors, and that other modifications or adaptations might occur to workers in the art. All such variations and modifications are intended to be included herein as being within the scope of the present invention as set forth. Further, in the claims hereinafter, the corresponding structures, materials, acts, and equivalents of all means or step-plus-function elements are intended to include any structure, material or acts for performing the functions in combination with other elements as specifically claimed. In practice, the foregoing method has yielded crosstalk negative values of better than \u221238 db. Because of the unique configuration of the PM connector plug and the PM connector adapter, when the connector plugs are tuned in accordance with the foregoing steps, the tuning is maintained in normal usage, due to the reduced float within the connectors described in the foregoing and resistance to any accidental or unintentional change of the setting of the ferrule in the connector plug. Step VIIIb) Adjust the analyzer, as discussed in the foregoing to \u22127\ufffd as indicated by the analyzer, which aligns the zero angle of the analyzer with the receptacle key. This is the master reference position. The sequence or order of jumpers 143 and 144 may be reversed, if desired or necessary. The connectors can now be tuned for optimum performance.",
