It was for a client in the banking industry that runs\u00a0 mission critical applications, as a result their IT infrastructure is very much locked down and they have M to the power of N layers of firewall in between the CRM Server and their SQL Server; with *everything* enforced via group policies., 52148=Then we started digging deeper around how else does CRM interact with SQL Server apart from TCP port 1433 for SQL Server Sockets service\u2026 With help from the support team from Microsoft Australia, we found out that there is a whole raft of other ports that the CRM Web Application and\u00a0 the Data Connector require to connect to the SQL Server., 47389=28 Sep, 63902=1.

Tagged: Business Action Training Tour, Business Action World Tour, China, CRM 4.0, Microsoft Business Solutions, Microsoft Dynamics, Microsoft Dynamics CRM. 10 comments The background: This is a way overdue post from earlier this year when I delivered some training courses in Mandarin Chinese in China. Fact is, I had to translate over 300 pages of PPT slides from English to Chinese. So I picked up a lot of CRM jargons in Chinese in a very short period of time. The training courses I delivered were Business Action World Tour in Beijing and Shanghai, which was a 200 level, 4 hours session on xRM with various other MSFT technologies. And Business Action Training Tour, a 300 level 2 day full on training course diving deep on BAWT contents in Guangzhou. The irony: \u2013 \u6076\u8865\u4e2d\u6587\uff01\uff08\u60e1\u88dc\u4e2d\u6587!\uff09 \u201cBut aren\u2019t you a native Chinese speaker?\u201d I hear you ask, and \u201cyes\u201d is the answer.
