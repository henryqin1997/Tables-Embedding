The first column in the adsorption zone (column C or E) is then isolated (closed-off) from the system. Air is then admitted solely into the second column of zone--1 (column D) or zone--2 (column F) via valves 1' and 7' or 1' and 16' respectively. The exiting lean gas from this column flows through either valves 9', 14' and 15' or valves 18', 5' and 6' to the inlet end of zone--2 or zone--1. This lean gas is used to pressurize the other zone to a range of 70-120%, preferably 80 to 105% of the adsorption pressure. After this step the zone is allowed to decrease in pressure by a time delay. The pressure drop occurs due to spontaneous adsorption by the carbon molecular sieves of some of the gas molecules. Generally, this pressure drop occurs in about 2 to 60 seconds. During this time the isolated column of the first adsorption zone is returned to atmospheric pressure by venting through valves 3', 4' or 13'. Once the repressurization phase is completed, the second column of the adsorption zone (i.e., Column D, or Column F) is countercurrently depressurized via valve 6' or",
