            "Chill, laid-back students who are eager to learn.",
            "Get to know your campus as fast as you can. Network in classes and the dorms, it WILL benefit you in someway. Buy books ahead of time.",
            "Generally, all the UC's have the same tuition rate. However, UCR's housing cost is significantly lower because they are not in the middle of a huge city like Los Angeles. Also, UCR gives a generous amount of financial aid.",
            "If you have a full schedule, or a job, or are involved in activities around campus, you will never be bored. However, if school is all you do Monday-Friday then UCR will be boring to you. My advice is to get involved in some way, whether it be a club, sport, fraternity/sorority, or even a job.",
            "Because I am an engineering major, I take many core classes in Calculus, Chemistry, and Physics. In these classes, I have certainly learned a lot. But to be honest, it depends on what professor you get in your class. The depth of learning is what you make of it. If you put in all your effort in a class (which can mean even teaching yourself) you learn a lot. I have also had the pleasure of learning from my peers. Making friends in classes is one of the best things to do."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{340262=There's not much to do if you don't have a car. Most students just go out to eat because Riverside has some great food places...EVERYWHERE. The city has a diverse selection of foods from American food, to Thai food, Indian food, Vietnamese food, etc and Asahi which is one of the most delicious All-You-Can-Eat restaurants around. May I add that these places are legit and not Americanized. Since it's really hot you can go swimming all the time. Some people hike the C which is a C on the top of a mountain. You can join clubs like Surf Club (they take you surfing) or outdoor excursions (they take you on countless trips). A lot of people also spend time at the gym playing intramurals., 473889=There's not too many unusual traditions I know of besides the school priding itself of its Scottish heritage through an occasional bagpipe practice every now and then, that can be heard from the residence halls. Our concerts held every school quarter have been traditions for many years, welcoming notable artists such as J.Cole, Lupe Fiasco, Nas, Mac Miller, Karmin, The Roots, Common, Kendrick Lamar, Chiddy Bang, Dev & The Cataracs, and more who have blessed UCR with their presence at some point in time. Being that our Botanical Garden is apart of the UCR campus, its not too unusual of a place, but definitely one that's uniquely beautiful., 686211=There has been a string of robberies on and near campus since January of 2013 . Students have been targeted for technology. Lap tops, I-Pads, and Smart Phones have been taken by force. The school has been scrutinized in the local newspaper as well a TV news cast. Escort services are available 24/7. The campus appears to be safe and tranquil, but I would not suggest walking in the surrounding community after dark alone. In all fairness, I would not walk around the part of Riverside I live in after dark alone either., 932456=Taking AP classes in high school and don't get lower than a B and you will have the GPA you need. Assuming of course that you absolutely do not fail any classes. From there, take the SAT or ACT a couple times and try to get above 1750 and you will be good to go., 691643=Admissions office considers the entire package- strength of transcript, SAT and SAT subject exam scores, and extracurriuluars all play a role in the decision making process. UCR had over 40,000 students apply for admission for the fall of 2013. For many students, UCR is a first choice rather than a backup school., 657457=Some days are better than others. Sometimes they have themes such a Cajun night or Thanksgiving Dinner and those nights the food is amazing. I personally liked the Dining Halls and as a student who no longer lives on campus I miss them., 513159=Lothian resident, Nicer than A-I, Pentland Hill is really nice but expensive. People at AI are more down to earth at least when I went there. Lothian people tend to be a bit clicky. Still both are expensive because of meal plan. May find a better deal off campus., 877551=They have limited greek life and the sororities/fraternities they do have are mostly community service based. On the up side, this means they cost only about 40 to 50 dollars a year instead of $2000 a quarter., 518259=2011-2012 school year we burned UC Irvine's mascot, the Anteater. That was really amusing and a great experience. We had fireworks shoot out from the buildings' rooftops to give a spectacular show., 1088951=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

At the same time, UCR is great for students who like to explore their majors through the different colleges that Riverside offers and meet great, new people everywhere you go. Tips for prospective students For students picking out a school or want to attend UC Riverside, I suggest that you work hard and look for a school that gives you a good financial aid packet. At the same time, how like Riverside the campus is diverse and has many opportunities for students. In addition, to check out the school and the location that it is located.",
