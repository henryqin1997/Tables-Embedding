            "You need to be a diligent student. Northeastern is not really a party school. Greek life exists, absolutely, but it isn't incredibly prominent. Boston provides a pretty liberal environment overall, and Northeastern fits that bill. Students who want the ability to explore a city with a million things to do should absolutely check out NU! Also, there are a ton of activities and clubs to partake in at this school, so it is a great institution for students who want to be involved!",
            "Living in Boston can be expensive. Especially when moving off campus, check out surrounding areas for more affordable rent and lifestyles. Come visit before registering! Get a feel for your surroundings. Boston is an amazing city, and NU has a great campus, but you should make sure you're a good fit for the environment before making any agreements. If you do come to Northeastern, try to fulfill core requirements early on by taking a variety of different types of classes - they can be really interesting and will help you solidify your academic career path!",
            "Northeastern just raised tuition, which isn't great news for everyone who has suffered during the current state of the economy. Yes, the typical program is five years, but you will not pay tuition the 18 months (3 six-month co-ops) you are not taking classes. The school tries to give financial aid to students.",
            "Northeastern hosts a fabulous mix of people. There are people from all walks of life, with all different kinds of interests. Because the school is a high caliber institution, you tend to find hard workers and make friends with others who value their education as much as you do. You can always find someone to hole up with in Club Snell (the library) but you can also find groups of people to join you at local bars and clubs!",
            "As a business major and music industry minor, I'm finding that most, if not all, of my professors are enthusiastic about what they teach, accessible, approachable, and fair. You will need to work pretty hard, but the knowledge is available if you're ready to absorb it."

To this end, there is also a great deal of resources that are available to assist with skill strengthening. Also, be prepared to take at least 3 courses in English, regardless of your major or ultimate study plan--it's a core requirement as of Fall 2013., 239339=The best benefit to a Northeastern education is the co-op program, by far. Take advantage of all of Boston's numerous employment opportunities, mingle with the Ivy kids around the corner, and feel secure in knowing that you've got the experience that counts in the job field. The biggest complaint? Particularly for people who value the small-campus experience, the undergrad class size is a little large for all of your teachers to know you by name. Still, the 14:1 student-teacher ratio is better than what you'd find elsewhere, by far., 690362=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 623930=In October we do an Underwear Run where anyone who wants to can strip down to just their underwear and run down the middle of Massachusetts Avenue and the Prudential Center. The school sanctions it, and it is a BLAST!!, 598842=We hold a naked marathon every year in October. The terrace at the Curry Student Center in the spring time is absolutely gorgeous., 103553=I love Northeastern, I have made so many friends since September and I did not know one person when I arrived. I love the city of Boston, and the campus it so pretty to be located in the middle of a city. There is always something going on on campus. The only set back is that Boston does not have the greatest under 21 night-life., 167454=Unusual tradition I have witnessed so far is the underwear run in the middle of October when it's freezing out. The amazing thing is that almost everyone participates in it that the cops have to show up just in case there are riots., 500022=The underwear run happens once a year during Parents' weekend, usually end of October, just before Halloween. On a Friday night, a huge portion of the student population gathers outside of the freshman quad in ridiculous outfits. Some students go all out with costumes and themed groups, while others decide to run in sports bras and spandex shorts. It is a great and fun tradition that shows our goofiness and lets everyone have a good time running around the streets of Boston, all around campus, and through the halls of the Prudential center to show our school pride., 228961=The underwear run! It happens in November during parents weekend. Also, the secret of Northeastern! (if you stand in the middle of the science quad and whisper, you can hear yourself as if you were speaking into your own ear!)}",

A popular stereotype that you might observe on campus is a hipster student. However, it is hard to stereotype students considering there is so many types. Generally, students here are smart and motivated. At the same time, students are not all bookworms and most are very involved in campus clubs and other activities, as well as participating in a lively social life. Essentially, Northeastern is a perfect fit for students who want a good education, like being able to explore a city, and like the idea of being able to boost your graduating resume through COOP. No student should worry about fitting in because with so many kids on campus, it is easy to make friends and find people your are compatible with. Although, our campus has 15,000 undergrads, it never feels this large, you will still",
