    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{39557=Special precautions are taken to ensure that the CdTe layer does not provide a significant shunting path to the conductive layer adjoining the CdS layer, while at the same time ensuring that the conductive layer is highly transmissive of light. This conductive layer preferably comprises one highly-conductive layer of tin oxide (approximately 1020 carrier per cm3), and another substantially lower conductivity layer adjoining the CdS layer. This second lower conductivity tin oxide layer has its carrier concentration adjusted so that when in contact with CdTe (where there are flaws in the CdS layer), a voltage and current are produced and shunting is avoided. The highly conductive tin oxide layer provides the desired low resistance path for the transmission of electrical energy within and between cells. A high degree of continuity of the low conductivity tin oxide layer is essential if there are a significant number of flaws in the CdS layer, and the desired uniformity of this tin oxide layer may be obtained by spraying a low molarity tin oxide solution for a long enough time so that a large number of droplets provide uniform statistical coverage of the high conductivity tin oxide layer. The conductivity of tin oxide may be easily varied in the range of at least six orders of magnitude., 72984=Tin oxide is a preferred material for achieving the above purposes due to its high transparency and dopability to achieve a wide range of resistivity. Other materials may, however, be used. Zinc oxide is one alternative and, although its extinction coefficient is smaller than that for tin oxide, its specific resistivity is considerably higher. The large electron density of tin oxide, generally greater than about 1020 /cm3, prevents its use as a junction material with every potential semi-conductor partner layer. Cadmium telluride may form the p-type layer for such a photovoltaic cell, since its carrier density can be approximately 1016 /cm3. The cell formed from these layers can thus be expected to have a low open-circuit voltage and/or unsatisfactory short-circuit current. By doping the tin oxide layer, however, a jundtion may be produced with the cadmium telluride layer which results in a reasonable voltage, current, and fill factor. The uniform continuity of the low carrier concentration density tin oxide layer is necessary to avoid shorts, while at the same time this tin oxide layer must remain thin, and preferably less than about 8,000 \u212b, to prevent unnecessary optical absorption. These objectives can be achieved by applying this layer with spray pyrolysis utilizing a large number of low molarity droplets to consistently and completely cover the low resistance tin oxide layer and thereby prevent low resistance shunt paths., 50533=The photovoltaic panel shown in FIG. 1 may be formed by successively applying thin, continuous layers of chemicals on a glass substrate. Individual cells are formed by making a series of elongate parallel cuts 20 through at least some of these layers to divide the panel into an elongate strips of cells according to the disclosure of U.S. Pat. No. 4,243,432. A layer or layers applied over the active photovoltaic layers also preferably provide the series interconnection of these cells to form the desired output voltage, and series interconnection strips 16 for accomplishing this purpose are generally depicted in FIG. 1. A suitable series interconnection configuration for electrically connecting cells is discussed subsequently. A suitable panel according to the present invention may thus be approximately 60 cm by 60 cm, and is capable of producing an output of approximately 50 watts with an incident isolation of approximately 1000 watts per square meter. For many commercial purposes, the desired electrical output is obtained by housing a plurality of panels in a module similar to the arrangement disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,233,085., 53071=The bottom tin oxide layer 24 serves the primary purpose of passing electrical energy through the cell and interconnecting the cell in a series arrangement, and thus should have a high conductivity. Preferably the layer 24 has a conductivity of more than 1000 mho/cm, and most preferably more than 2200 mho/cm. Using prior art techniques, a highly conductive yet highly transmissive tin oxide layer has been generated having a specific conductivity of 3700 mho/cm, so that obtaining a tin oxide layer with a specific conductivity of approximately 2200 mho/cm is feasible on a commercial basis. For reasons explained subsequently, the top tin oxide layer 26 must have low conductivity, should be thin, and also must have a high degree of continuity (few pinholes or flaws in layer 26 are permissible). High continuity of this layer may be obtained utilizing a low molarity tin oxide spray solution for the spray pyrolysis process. The specific conductivity of the upper tin oxide layer preferably is in the range from approximately 1.25\ufffd10-3 to 100 mho/cm. The thickness of the lower tin oxide layer is not particularly critical, but is preferably in the range 0.4 to 1.0 microns. The thickness of the upper tin oxide layer may be from approximately 0.1 to approximately 1.0 microns and, as previously noted, is doped with a suitable metal such as cadmium or zinc to produce low carrier concentration., 40903=According to one embodiment of the present invention, a high efficiency CdS/CdTe backwall photovoltaic panel is formed by first spraying a high conductivity tin oxide layer on a glass substrate utilizing spray pyrolysis to obtain a layer with a specific conductivity in the range of from 1000 to 5000 mho/cm. The low conductivity second tin oxide layer is then applied by the same technique using a low molarity solution suitably doped to obtain a desired carrier concentration in the resulting film. In an exemplary case, a conductivity of approximately 0.10 mho/cm with a carrier concentration of 4\ufffd1017 carriers/cm3 is used, with a CdTe layer having a carrier concentration of 5\ufffd1015 carriers/cm3 to produce a satisfactory photovoltaic cell. In this case, cadmium was used as the tin oxide dopant, but zinc or other metals may be used. It should be pointed out that the carrier concentration, while related to conductivity, is not a direct function of it but is related in part to the dopant used and resulting mobility. Conductivity measurements are expressed in this application because carrier concentration is difficult to measure. The CdS layer may then be applied by spray pyrolysis (or other suitable technique) to an initial thickness in the range of from 2,000 to 12,000 \u212b, and a substantially thick CdTe layer applied by an atmospheric temperature spraying and compression technique (or similar method). The panel is then heat treated and the active photovoltaic layers regrown at approximately 540\ufffd C. to form large CdTe crystals, while the CdS diffuses or migrates between or into these crystals and forms a layer having an effective thickness in the range of approximately 1/20th of its initial thickness. The panel is then divided into cells and the cells series interconnected, and the completed panel encapsulated. The active areas of a photovoltaic panel have a comparatively high efficiency up to 18% over a long cell life, in large part due to the increased efficiency attributable to the effectively thin CdS layer. The quantum efficiency of the cell in the spectral band at wavelengths shorter than 520 nm may surprisingly be approximately 90%. The tin oxide layer, with an appropriate carrier concentration, in combination with a suitable p-type material layer, will produce voltage and current when exposed to sunlight where there are flaws in the CdS layer.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has thus been described in terms of specific embodiments which are set forth in detail, it should be understood that this discussion and the drawings which form a part of this disclosure should not be understood as limiting this invention. Various alternative embodiments and operating techniques will become apparent to those skilled in the art in view of this disclosure. The invention should thus be understood to include various embodiments not described herein, and the invention is limited only by reasonable construction of the claims attached hereto in view of this disclosure. A complete understanding of the mechanical and chemical functions occurring during the substantial reduction in the effective thickness of the CdS layer (or other n-type layer highly transmissive of sunlight) is not yet fully understood. This reduction in effective thickness is primarily believed to be due to diffusion, interdiffusion, and/or migration of CdS material into the CdTe (or other p-type material) layer, with CdS material entering the voids between the regrown CdTe crystals and depositing on the available CdTe surfaces. The term \"diffusion\" as used herein with respect to the action occurring during the reduction in the effective thickness of the n-type layer should be understood to encompass conventional diffusion, as well as interdiffusion and migration into the p-type layer. Also, those skilled in the art will appreciate that while diffusion of the n-type layer into the p-type layer will reduce",
