            "Lipscomb is a great place for students who want to be engulfed in a Christian environment and want to grow closer to spend a lot of time focusing on their faith.",
            "Visit the campus. No matter what school you're looking at, never make your final decision without visiting the campus during the school year. Lipscomb is the perfect fit for me, but you'll never know if its the perfect fit for you until you see it for yourself.",
            "I'm not the biggest fan of paying about $30,000 a year for anything.",
            "I love all of the people I've met at Lipscomb so far. The campus has a good sense of community, except on the weekends. Our campus is kind of dead on the weekends most of the time because there is a lot for students to do in Nashville, so nobody really wants to stay on campus. During the week though, there is always something going on in Bison Square or the Student Center.",
            "All I have really taken so far is a bunch of gen. eds. so none of my classes have really been all that difficult. Although, I have a feeling that will be changing next year when I get more into my major."

I have made many friends here that I know will be friends for life. Lipscomb's Student Government Association plans 4-5 activities per semester to help students stay involved on campus. The biggest event SGA planned in the 2010 fall semester was Lipscomb's first Paint Rave. With over 600 students in attendance, the rave was a huge success! Also, Garner Goode with Lipscomb in Motion (the student life events planner), has events on the school calendar almost every night. From free food in Arlo's to a movie night in Alumni Auditorium, students are never without access to a good time. Social clubs (Lipscomb's alternative to sororities/fraternities) and athletic events also give students a chance to interact outside of the classroom and spend time together. Lipscomb's service clubs give students the chance to enjoy some of the same aspects of a social club, while finding ways to give back to the community. Lipscomb is located in Nashville, giving students total access to the famous, music city. Within minutes of the Grand Ole Opry, Opryland, Green Hills mall, Sweet CeCe's and so much more, students are able to have fun off campus without having to use up a lot of gas., 159808=If you plan to commute, plan on 8:00 classes or plan to park off-campus and hike to class. Also, consider that this is a Christian school. If you're uncomfortable with Christianity/Christians/religion in general, you may not feel comfortable, as it is very open about its stand on faith (though never shove-it-down-your-throat) and you are required to get chapel credits by attending chapel/chapel-like events., 120796=Be prepared to pay at least $2000 in hidden fees. Get used to studying a a lot. Have fun!, 59337=the dorms look amazing and I already got a roommate. I get to move into my dorm in august., 168009=The food id pretty predictable and the cafe closes at 7:30 so that's a struggle., 247965=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Lipscomb is a prestigious school. It's all in the price tag. The money I am paying is worth it though. The SGA and the College Ministry Team are always providing free food or some kind of fun activity for the students. Am enjoying being here I couldn't stand the size of certain other campuses I visted (like Kennesaw State). The size of Lipscomb's campus is perfect for those who want an easy transition into college life. Not only is the campus the perfect size it also has the best activities for any mood you might be in. The food is superb and the recently added Chick-Fil-A is my favorite of all the fast food places on campus. The surrounding area is perfect for riding bikes or running and",
