For instance, in the period sampled, there were 148,326 instances where no balance transfers were identified in step 606 above, and for which a comparison of actual consumer data showed there were in fact no balance transfers in. This compares to only 9,534 instances where no balance transfers were identified in step 606, but there were in fact actual balance transfers.}",

This allows separation into groups based on spend capacity. A company can then continue with method 2000 for identifying correlations, or the company may look to non-credit-related characteristics of the consumers in a category for correlations., 34728=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/978,298, filed Oct. 29, 2004, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety., 90057=In step 2004, model outputs are created for samples of customers from each category. The customers used in step 2004 are those for whom detailed information is known., 75333=It should be readily appreciated that as the rolling calculations proceed, the consumer's category may change based on the outputs that result, and, therefore, different formula corresponding to the new category may be applied to the consumer for different periods of time. The rolling manner described above maximizes the known data used for estimating consumer spend in a previous twelve month period 1006.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the best methodologies of the disclosure have been particularly described above, it is to be understood that such descriptions have been provided for purposes of illustration only, and that other variations both in form and in detail can be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, which is defined first and foremost by the appended claims. Additionally, the SoW model may be used in any company having a large customer service call center to identify specific types of customers. Transcripts are typically made for any call from a customer to a call center. These transcripts may be scanned for specific keywords or topics, and combined with the SoW model to determine the consumer's characteristics. For example, a bank having a large customer service center may scan service calls for discussions involving bankruptcy. The bank could then use the SoW model with the indications from the call center transcripts to evaluate the customer. SoW data can also be used across nearly all industries to improve customer loyalty by reducing the number of payment reminders sent to responsible accounts. Responsible accounts are those who are most likely to pay even without being contacted by a collector. The reduction in reminders may increase customer loyalty, because the customer will not feel that the lender or service provider is unduly aggressive. The lender's or service provider's collection costs",
