            "I feel very safe on campus. I walk to and from class everyday and have never felt threaten. Lourdes also provides shuttle services to keep students safe.",
            "Lourdes does not offer Greek life.",
            "Lourdes is just starting to grow and expand. There are not as many clubs as larger schools. The activities are fun when I attend.",
            "I think that Lourdes is great for any type of student. There is someone here for anyone. Each person would fit in somewhere.",
            "On campus there are many unique items. There is the Grotto, which was built by young nuns. There is also hand made tiles that were made by the nuns as well.",
            "I really enjoy Lourdes University. I feel like the small class size is worth the cost. The only thing not worth the money would have to be the meal plan.",
            "I like to go to student events for fun. I also enjoy the exercising trials near the housing. Since we live in the city, there are always things to do.",
            "The food is good for a while. After a while it gets repetitive. It is also very expensive.",
            "The housing is awesome. I love having my own kitchen and bathroom! The only down side is the amount of hot water, which is not much.",
            "Lourdes University classes are tough, but the professors are willing to help. There is always help when needed. There are many tutors available.",
            "Prospective students should try to get at least a 3.5 in high school to get the best scholarship. They should take the time to tour campus and see what is offered. Prospective students should not be afraid to ask questions.",
            "Lourdes is a university that cares about each person. Students are not just a number to the faculty and staff. I feel at home."

Bang for the buck it's a little on the expensive side being a private school but it is a great atmosphere, wonderful education, interesting and free/fun experiences, and well worth the money. What to do for fun student activities (leap) offers a lot of fun and amazing opportunities for students and always for free! there is also a mall nearby, and plenty of clubs and such. Food and Dining with a new cafeteria, there is always a multitude of different delicious flavors made fresh every day by our food crew! Dorm Life the dorms are converted apartments a block away from campus and they have a lot of quality for the value! there's no place else that you will find dorms like these! Academic Rigor classes can be quite hard but not unbearable and most of the teachers are very helpful! Tips for prospective students",
