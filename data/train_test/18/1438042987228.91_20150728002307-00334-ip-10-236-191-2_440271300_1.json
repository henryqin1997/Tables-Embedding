Comparison of Technologies Mobile phones of this class are attached to either GPRS or GSM voice service. One needs to switch manually between services. Class C Mobile phones of this class can be attached to both GPRS and GSM services, but using only one service at a time. Switching between them (suspend/resume) is done automatically. Class B GSM services simultaneously. Mobile phones of this class can be connected to both GPRS and Class A There are three GPRS classes which help indicate the capabilities of a mobile phone.
