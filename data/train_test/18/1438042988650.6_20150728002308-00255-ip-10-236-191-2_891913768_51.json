            "For the majority of the year the campus doesn't have incidents, but there are several occasion where students are robbed, attacked, or confronted with other ways of aggressive abuse. There also has been incidents where students or civilians around the area have lost their lives due to deadly confrontation. The school is located in the West End and borders rough neighborhoods such as The Bluff, Bankhead, and Mechanicsville.",

            "Every Thursday at 11am, there's a mandatory assembly called Crown Forum.",
            "The school is expensive! So if you don't take school serious, then you might want to reconsider, unless you have money to waste.",
            "There's events going on campus almost all the time. Being that Morehouse is in the AUC, you have Spelman and Clark Atlanta right next door.",
            "The cafe is for the most part not good. The first week it'll will seem like heaven but afterwards, you just get tired of eating the same food.",
            "Being a male institution, visitation rules are strict. Their are limited times throughout the day students are allowed females visitors. Also the dorms are historic, so there old. But kickbacks are usually turnt, when there is visitation.",
            "Classes can be difficult depending mostly on the professors. Biology majors usually have the harder courses.",
            "In short, Morehouse is what you make of it. You can be focused in your school work, become a party person, or TRY to balance both.",
            "Glad I decided to attend this college. It's a great HBCU, for young black men trying to make a difference in their lives and that of others. Most graduates are pointed in the right direction into their designated career path."

The DJ plays songs to get the crowd moving, and sometimes the DJ picks people from the crowd to dance on stage. Also, at hump Wednesday we have step battles between the Frat groups and other battles between the Sororities. Also, a lot of celebrities visit our school because Morehouse is well known. We have Celebrity Basketball games. Also, every year around October, we have Homecomings where celebrities come, and we also have dances during Homecoming. I would love to go on about how much fun we have at Morehouse, but it would go far beyond 300 words., 49436=Morehouse College Is Great For Those Types Of Students Whom Wish To Follow The Great Foot Steps Of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Those Foot Steps Of Spike Lee, And The Other Who May Have Came Before Them., 58357=The residence halls represent different learning communities dependent upon your major and career aspirations. For example, Brazeal Hall is primarily for iSTEM (Innovations in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) students. This is an easy way to form study groups and find students that have common academic interests. Also, there is a friendly rivalry between freshmen residence halls. We have step team and stroll team competitions, and also a year-long competition for residence hall of the year. Now, for the bad. Bathroom facilities are communal so they are shared with everyone on your floor. Not all men are sanitary, so it can get a little annoying. Another bad thing is that freshmen are not allowed to have female visitation in the residence halls until after homecoming, which doesn't happen until mid-October., 343050=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 52143=As A Prospective Student I Would Recommend You To Realize That There Is A Difference Between A Boy And A MAN!!!

Its a bit challenging to get used to if you are used to living in cities such as Manhattan. However, if you have a car or you just have good knowledge of Georgia, then this college might just be for you. Tips for prospective students If you are considering",
