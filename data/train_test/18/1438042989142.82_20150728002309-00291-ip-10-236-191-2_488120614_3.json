Contractual agreements between municipalities and early intervention providers, and between agency providers and individual early intervention providers should include specific provisions on early intervention records to ensure that all federal and state requirements pertaining to these records are met. Periodic municipal review of provider early intervention records is recommended and should occur whenever possible at the provider site to avoid copying expenses and to minimize interruption of service delivery. It is strongly recommended that municipalities and providers organize children's early intervention records in the chronological order in which events occur for programmatic monitoring and fiscal audit purposes. It is recommended that municipalities and early intervention providers utilize a list or form to track significant dates and events as the child/family progresses through the early intervention system. The list/form should include relevant information for either the record maintained by the municipality, or the record maintained by a provider related to the service(s) provided. It is recommended that the list/form be located at the front of the child/family record for ease of access by providers, parents, municipalities and federal, state and local auditors.
