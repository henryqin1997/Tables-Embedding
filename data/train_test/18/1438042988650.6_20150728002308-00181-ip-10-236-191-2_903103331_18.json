            "Those who study well, interested in learning, and those who do not feel the need to over-socialize.",
            "Learn to study early and manage your time well, you don't want to get over your head early on because things can get stressful.",
            "My financial aid last year was exceptional. I received around $52,000 in grants, so it was definitely worth it. Make sure you apply for financial aid, you might be surprised at how much they are willing to give. Without the financial aid, I would say it would be 4.25 stars because they lack the free things available at other colleges, for example a free gym membership (that is not available at Cornell U). However, there are many connections available via career fairs that have many famous companies such as Microsoft, Google, etc. Once again, the sky is the limit.",
            "Things tend to be competitive and the conceptual nature of questions leaves a lot to the imagination when it comes to deciding what and how much to study. The people seem to be attempting for a new start and reaching to be cool and fail. The people don't understand comradery and loyalty amongst friends. Not the best social hub, but a great place to learn.",
            "The method of teaching tends to be very conceptual, generally starting from the foundations. I learn new things about certain subjects that I have already taken classes on. In addition, the facilities and faculty allow for an individual to go beyond the curriculum for an individual's classes. The sky is the limit if you reach for it."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{9825=The administration doesn't exactly fend of the sense that it extorts its students. It often delivers financial aid packages late, and fails to make provisions taken for granted at many college institutions, such as a free gym membership, free printing, or unrestricted internet use. This year 2000 students' social security numbers were stolen on an unencrypted administrative computer in the school's CIT dept. Despite these gaffes and the exorbitant prices, Cornell's prestige as a university and it's extensive alumni and research networks make up for these pitfalls by providing many unique opportunities to its students., 443437=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 200793=Classes are tough, but I found them very manageable if you are willing to put in the time and effort. Because it's a really big undergrad population (about 14,000) a lot of classes are taught by TAs, especially 1000 and 2000 level courses, so a lot of the time the rigor/enjoyability of classes depends on the competence of your TA., 125892=There are SO many things! There's the Ithaca commons, over 1000 clubs, hiking, gorge jumping, nature walks, and so much more. Cornell also makes a point to put on numerous events to keep the students preoccupied and busy in their free time!, 123911=There are over 1000 clubs on campus, ranging from professional and activist clubs, cultural clubs, to learning how to play instruments or watching certain tv shows with one another., 238829=There are over 1000 student organizations on campus, and although I am sure you've heard this many times already, there really are clubs for every interest! At ClubFest you will find hundreds of tables set up with people trying to get you to sign their email lists, and if you have even the slightest interest, I suggest signing up. The worst that will happen is that you will receive many emails from tons of clubs, but it may be worth it when one email catches your eye! Many of these clubs hold activities like skating at Lynah Rink or potlucks., 230116=For fun, there is always something to do on campus except during study period and finals week. If you join a club or two and keep your eyes open for flyers finding something to do will be easy. Word of mouth always works too. As far as off-campus goes, Ithaca is one of those towns that would not exist if not for the universities that reside there, but there are a couple things you can do. In October, the city hosts a weekend-long apple festival where many local vendors come out to showcase many edible goodies for sale such as apple cider, funnel cake, caramel apples, and much more. The apple cider donuts are to die for. In February, you can warm up to Ithaca's Chili Festival. There are also tons of restaurants in Collegetown and the Commons that serve a diverse cuisine (this is how I first tried Indian food). If this isn't enough for you, there is a list of 161 things Every Cornellian Should do. If you start running out of stuff to do, refer to this list. http://cornellsun.com/blog/2005/02/27/big-red-ambition-161-things-every-cornellian-should-do/, 238311=Greek life is very dominant on campus, and there are a large number of diverse houses. Sororities and fraternities are always holding fundraisers or formals. Rush week in January is said to be an unforgettable experience!, 357509=Visit during the months of January or February so you can get a feel for the weather. It's definitely not for everyone. Have an open mind and explore as many new clubs and classes as you can the first year. Don't be afraid to take chances., 228476=1) Cornell has a small lake between North and Central Campus along with many gorges and rivers. 2) There is also a botanical garden and arboretum that is part of the campus that is very beautiful during the spring and summer. 3) The biggest celebration at Cornell is called Slope Day where everyone gathers on Libe Slope after the last day of classes for a massive concert with guests such as Ludacris, Kendrick Lamar and many more. Not to mention great food., 755=Be prepared for the winter weather, it doesn't stop snowing until April. Make friends with an upperclassman- they give the best advice and can provide answers for the best way of doing something (workload assigned by professors, how to store things, best bus to take to the mall)., 73709=Psych 1101 is amazing, regardless of your major., 294928=Great school academically with a beautiful campus and great opportunities, but it is EXTREMELY cold. Visited in September and it was already freezing., 2512=There are so many diverse classes that are just waiting to be taken including: PLPA 2010 Magical Mushrooms, Mischievous Molds, HADM 4430 Introduction to Wines (must be 21 or older to take), and HD 3620 Human Bonding (for those trying to figure out the opposite sex). There are a lot of opportunities to learn whatever you want, you just have to find the right people.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Login to rate or flag the reviews Samantha from Ithaca, NY 01/04/2010 Reviewer is A current student here. 43 out of 43 people found this review useful. 2 of 96 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Honestly, Cornell is great for just about every student that is willing to work as hard as possible and be open to helping others. Although competition does play a part at Cornell, the student body is much more likely to help you figure out a question that steal your homework the night it is due. Tips for prospective students Be yourself from the very first day. Cornell has enough students that you will blend in whether partying every day of the week is your thing or playing board games and having laundry parties is your Friday night plan of choice. Walk in knowing that there are many students smarter than you, but you also can compete with the best. Not to mention, you want smarter kids such that you will feel empowered to work your hardest to get the success you deserve.",
