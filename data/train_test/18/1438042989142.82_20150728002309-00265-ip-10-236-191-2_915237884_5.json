I have enjoyed all my business classes and teachers, and they are teaching me a lot., 203345=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 126455=Washburn does not have control of their classes and for someone with high anxiety it causes problems in the ability for me to pay attention when other students are talking during a lecture. I have such a low GPA the semester of Spring 2013 because the student medical service told me I had a blood fungus which my job said I could not work till it was cleared up; upon getting health Insurance I went to a different doctor and they said that was not the case; I was unable to get to many of my classes due to no funds for gas. I am taking online classes because their information taught in the classes is good information so I hope that online classes will allow me to do better work.}",
