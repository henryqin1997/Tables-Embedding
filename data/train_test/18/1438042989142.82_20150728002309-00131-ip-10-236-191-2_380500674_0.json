There are four sets of Clickfast tabs in the short. The inseam on the Medium short is 10\". Small to XXL sizes. They are cycling shorts -- there's a 400-series Endura stretch chamois inside. There are silicone gel leg grippers. The shorts fit like a second skin. Still, they're best worn under shorts. There are CoolMax Lycra front and rear panels, but the side panels are wicking stretch mesh panels that are best only seen by an intimate. Not that we're modest;",
