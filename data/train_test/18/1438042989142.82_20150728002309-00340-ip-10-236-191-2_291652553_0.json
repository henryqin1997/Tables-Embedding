Beginning in 1962 and extending to 2007, this collection has information regarding the parties involved, and can provide information needed to request copies of divorce decrees, which are available through individual county courts in Ohio. The Ohio Office of Vital Statistics does not issue the divorce decrees, these records are abstracts that provide limited information used for filing purposes. While this collection contains a wide range of years, unfortunately, 1964, 1965, 1966 and 1972 are missing, as abstracts for these years are not available from the Ohio Office of Vital Statistics. As this is a more recent collection, this index potentially provides an opportunity to find more recent family history of relatives who may still be living. The abstracts contain husband\u2019s name, wife\u2019s name, birth years, year of divorce, county of residence, number of minor children, marriage duration, grounds for divorce, and to whom the decree was granted.",
