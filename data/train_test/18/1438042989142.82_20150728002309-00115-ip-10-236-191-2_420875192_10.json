It's been my biggest beef with Canon. They leave out small details in the interest of so-called product differentiation in their lower end models of DSLR's which quite practically need not be excluded...for example 1/3 stop ISO, spot metering, 2 sec delay timers, personalized settings, and 'novel' features like multiple exposures for starters. This stuff is implementable in software (except for perhaps the spot metering). And why not include some rubber gasketing",
