            "While the campus is located in a dangerous city, the college does a good job keeping students on and around campus safe. There are many campus safety security guards that rotate patrols throughout the day/night. The city of Flint police officers also have patrol routes through campus to help keep students safe.",
            "There are a number of different fraternities and sororities students can join while attending school. These groups have houses that range from very close to campus (2 miles) to far away from campus (20 miles).",
            "There are many different clubs you can join while attending the school. These range from book, chemistry, and dancing clubs to sports, paint ball, and fitness groups. The college has a few sports teams (Ultimate Frisbee and Ice Hockey), but most sports are intramural.",
            "This school is great for students who like a fast learning pace, and for students who want to work a real job while also attending school to get an education in a certain field of study. The school is known for its many engineering programs, but also has good chemistry and physics programs.",
            "The school is located in Flint, Michigan. The school was once known as the General Motor Institute. It has since changed it's name to Kettering University. This history explains why the school has many knowledgeable alumni that now hold jobs in engineering positions.",
            "Kettering is a tremendous school for prospective engineering majors. There are many laboratories and classrooms well equipped for teaching and learning in the college. The professors are very knowledgeable and work hard to make sure students learn to the best of their abilities. At Kettering, while attending school, you must also work at a Co-Op job or as an intern for 5 of 8 terms. You rotate between classes at Kettering University, and a Co-Op job somewhere in the country every 3 months. This allows the student to gain their required amount of credit hours to graduate in their major, while also giving students real life experience in the work force. Students are payed a real wage while working as a co-op employee. This converts into a large tuition to attend school at Kettering, but the co-op experience allows you to save a large amount of money while you work.",
            "While living on dorm, the hall plans many events throughout the year. They often have barbeque's and other club events around campus. There are intramural sports, fields and tracks, a gym and fitness center, as well as some fraternities and sororities near and away from Kettering. Students can also visit downtown Flint and explore many of the different shops and restaurants in the city.",
            "There is a cafe located next to the dorms on campus at Kettering. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner Monday to Friday, as well as brunch and dinner on weekends. The cafe has a large selection of food ranging from pastas, pizzas and grilled items, to salads, cooked meals, and desserts. Students are required to buy the meal plan for at least 1 academic term.",
            "The dorms at Kettering University are located in Flint, Michigan. While the city of Flint is very dangerous, the campus is a very safe environment! There are multiple campus security guards patrolling, as well as Flint police officers. The dorms have a number of events planned throughout the year to keep residents occupied. Students are required to live at least 1 academic year in the dorms on campus.",
            "Some courses are rather difficult, but basic courses are easy. All terms at Kettering University are about 3 months in length. This is shorter than normal colleges. In addition to this, you are still earning the same number of credits as other colleges (per term), but in a shorter period of time. This makes maintaining excellent grades more difficult, but still possible.",
            "First, you should do some online research to see if this is a prospective school for you. Next, you should visit the campus and see if you would be comfortable living there (must live 1 year in campus dorms). Finally, talk to the offices at Kettering about financial obligations and scholarship opportunities.",
            "Kettering University is a very good, expensive school for students interested in pursuing a degree in Engineering. They have other programs as well, including Chemistry and Physics Majors. The college focuses heavily on a Co-Op/Intern working education, which you do while attending classes at the school."

And when you budget your earnings from your co-op properly, there shouldn't be too much of an issue. As of 2012, there are now more jobs than students again., 224312=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 192999=If you aren't sure you want to go into your degree field, don't attend Kettering. While it is a great school, it is hard to transfer out of and it isn't the cheapest place around. If you are looking for a ton of people, don't attend Kettering. We have maybe 1000 students on campus at a time, and that isn't for everybody. Don't think Kettering is like every other school, the faculty and staff expect more mature behavior because we are all employed by a company and therefore are held to a higher standard. Plus the classes are so small that they will notice if you aren't there. Visit the campus before you apply. You have to be comfortable here to succeed. I am very happy with my choice to attend this school, but I have seen people burn out from it and waste money and time that could have been spent somewhere else. Also, don't let anyone tell you that you can't go to Kettering just because you have a ton of money. Most of us are very dependent on our scholarships and co-op wages, so don't think you'll be the only one. Your work in high school does pay off in terms of scholarships and don't be afraid to ask questions, there are tons of people that are ready and willing to help., 48305=I'm from California and I visited Kettering in March when it was snowing and it was just beautiful. It ay have been cold, but the school is built for it. They have an underground tunnel-way where students can walk from building to building, underground, without getting wet or cold. The dorms are also small, but private, with one person to a room and they can be customized in almost any way that you want. You can also personalize the wall outside your room if you would like as long as you get permission from the school., 83008=It depends on the section you go. A-section school term starts in July and ends in September. B-section school term starts in October and goes till December. During the summer term for A-section, it's a blast. Everyone is outside grilling burgers and hot dogs. You can always find people playing beach volleyball or corn-hole. There are large fields where you can play soccer, football, softball, or ultimate frisbee. There is also a very nice recreational center with a pool, 2 full basketball courts, 2 full tennis courts, dance studio, all exercise machines, and running track.}",

Tips for prospective students Be prepared to learn. Kettering student body is broken into two sections so that half can be in school and the other half can work at their co-op job. These sections switch every three months. Thus, each class is condensed from the typical full-year school year to just those three months. Login to",
