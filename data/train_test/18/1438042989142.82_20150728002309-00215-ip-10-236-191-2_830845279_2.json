Quarterly revenues also remained nearly flat year over year due to negative comps. Brinker\u2019s comps have lost momentum in the last two quarters, decreasing 0.9% and 0.5% in the third and fourth quarters, respectively, owing to lower traffic and frail industry sales. Although the company has taken a set of initiatives to boost its comps, a muted comps guidance of 1%\u20132% for fiscal 2014 remains a concern., 14886=by Zacks Equity Research \u00a0\u00a0Published on August 26, 2013 |, 22439=However, some positive attributes prevent us from being too pessimistic on the stock. Despite macroeconomic volatility, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has reported year-over-year growth in profitability for the past 12 quarters, driven by its cost-saving efforts. Moreover, the company through its \u201cPlan to Win\u201d initiative continues to focus on augmenting its sales, earnings, profitability and return to shareholders. Moreover, Brinker is on its way to reach its earnings per share target of $4.00 by fiscal 2017 by growing its earnings by 10%\u201315% annually.\u00a0, 20203=We are reverting our recommendation on the restaurateur, Brinker International Inc. (EAT - Analyst Report), to Neutral from Outperform owing to soft revenues and comps in fourth-quarter fiscal 2013., 61290=Copyright \u00a9 2015 Zacks Investment Research, 61351=At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system.
