Those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains may make other modifications and other embodiments employing the principles of this invention, particularly upon considering the foregoing teachings. Therefore, by the appended claims, the applicant intends to cover any modifications and other embodiments as incorporate those features which constitute the essential features of this invention. FIGS. 5-8 show a second embodiment 100 of the latching assembly of the present invention. In this embodiment, the assembly 100 engages the cabinet housing B at the sides of the drawer D rather than at the top. This assembly 100 includes an actuator 112 which drives a pair of pivoting segments 111 that lie pivotally mounted to the drawer D. Each of these segments drives an engaging or latching segment 114 though a linkage arm segment 115 that lies hingedly secured to the pivoting segment 111 at one end and secured to the engaging segment 114 at an opposite end. Compression springs 113 bias the engaging segment 114 outwardly of the drawer and into a first, latching position shown in FIG. 7 where the engaging segment 114 extends into an opening in the cabinet housing B. (The sides of this opening act as a stop.) Raising of the actuator 112 as shown in",
