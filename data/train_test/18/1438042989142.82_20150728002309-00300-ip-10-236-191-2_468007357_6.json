BOYNTON ETAL 3,516,889, 33196=From the filling station the plurality of strips are directed into the closing station which progressively moves the top edge of the filled pockets against the rear strip in a direction normal thereto to form neat folds after which they are heat sealed to close the open ends. This is illustrated, described and claimed in the copending ap plication of William P. Hidden, Ser. No. 498,683, filed Oct. 20, 1965, for Fluted Package Sealing Apparatus and assigned to the assignee of the present invention which issued into Pat. No. 3,432,990, dated Mar. 18, 1969. Thereafter, the strips are advanced through a folding device for the flap, if the flap width is added to the rear strips, where the flap is folded and sealed to the back of the rear strips after which the individual packets are severed from the strips, collected in cartons ready for shipment., 32701=After the back strips 12 leave the oven chamber 62 through an aperture 175, they are turned from a flat position to a vertical position and passed through the filling section where a condiment is delivered thereto. The structure and method of filling the pockets is illustrated, described and claimed in the patent to A. C.
