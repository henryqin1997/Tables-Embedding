    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{36957=According to further exemplary embodiments of the present invention, higher temperature thermoplastic adhesives, referred to herein as UHT hot melt materials or UHT hot melt adhesives, may be utilized. For wider temperature operating environments such as Central office and Outside Plant, adhesives must have an operating range of \u221240\ufffd to +85\ufffd C. to meet the Telcordia GR-326 CORE and GR-1435-CORE Standards. Traditionally, it was believed that adhesives needed to have a glass transition temperature (\u201cTg\u201d) that was higher than the upper limit of the operating temperature range (i.e. epoxy adhesives). Further, it has been generally held and empirically proven that having the Tg in the middle of the operating temperature range could result in inconsistent optical performance due to nonlinear changes in the physical properties of the adhesive at temperatures above the Tg, such as the coefficient of thermal expansion and flow behavior of the adhesive, leading to fiber pistoning. However, exemplary samples tested below should not exhibit such pistoning because of their creep-resistance properties., 62640=An adhesive filled ST connector was placed into an oven (available from Kitco, in Virginia) and heated to about 265\ufffd C. until molten. The bare optical fiber was then inserted through the axial bore in the ceramic ferrule to a position where the fiber end face protruded past the ferrule end face, and the Kevlar Fibers and jacketing material entered the body portion of the connector and contacted the adhesive. It is noted that the bead of hot melt adhesive on the ferrule end face provides lateral support for the fiber during the cleaving process. The cleaved fiber was then polished with a 2 \u03bcm aluminum oxide lapping film (available from 3M Company, # 60-6500-2346-2) to a specified length. Polishing can be performed to generate a fiber end face that is coplanar with the ferrule and face. Alternatively, polishing can be performed to create a fiber protrusion up to about 1.5 \u03bcm. An interferometer (available from Direct Optical Research Corporation\u2014DORC ZX-1 Mini PMS) can be used to measure the fiber protrusion after polishing.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets The present invention should not be considered limited to the particular examples described above, but rather should be understood to cover all aspects of the invention as fairly set out in the attached claims. Various modifications, equivalent processes, as well as numerous structures to which the present invention may be applicable will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art to which the present invention is directed upon review of the present specification. The claims are intended to cover such modifications and devices. In another performance test, sample UHT holt melt adhesives were utilized in a test of 7 connectorized pairs of LC Connectors. These connectors were preloaded with exemplary UHT hot melt adhesives (in this test, Henkel materials) and terminated in the manner described above. All of the test samples passed Telcordia GR-326 Engineering (screening) tests, which had the same temperature limits, but shorter test durations to accelerate feedback. In another performance test, sample UHT holt melt adhesives (in this test, Henkel materials) were prepared. To test the performance of the Henkel 12\u2013692 adhesive, 15 connectorized pairs of SM SC/UPC connectors were submitted to complete Telcordia GR-326 environmental tests. All SM SC/UPC connectors were preloaded with UHT hot melt as described above and all optical fibers were terminated in the manner described above. All test samples passed the optical requirements of <0.3 dB change in Loss and >55 dB",
