Saturday 20 June 2009 and Manchester United issued the following statement... 'Following contact received from Carlos Tevez's advisors last night, in advance of the deadline the club set for concluding negotiations, Manchester United announces that Carlos will not be signing a new contract with the club.' 'The club agreed to pay the option price of \u00a325.5million and offered Carlos a five-year contract which would have made him one of its highest-paid players.' 'Disappointingly however, his advisors informed the club that, despite the success he has enjoyed during one of the club's most successful periods, he does not wish to continue playing for Manchester United.' 'The club would like to thank Carlos for his services over the last two seasons and wishes him good luck for the future.' Chelsea are 11/2 second favourites to sign the Argentinean but realistically, they don't have a hope in hell. It might be a tad premature but let me be the first to welcome Tevez to Sportcity., 11883=EDS Lads Did Their Bit!
