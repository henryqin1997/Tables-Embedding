Science professors often take an academically Darwinian approach to their courses. Someone I know scored a 1540 in two sections of the SAT, and got a C- in biology. Academic rigor is good, but when you apply to graduate school, you can't use the stringent grading system from Geneseo as an excuse for not having a stellar transcript., 191302=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 21461=Geneseo is great in that there is a place for everyone. Geneseo is the type of school where by the end of the first break in October, freshmen tell their parents they cannot wait to go back home. School is part of everyday life but it is the things that happen outside of class that make the experience. There are so many opportunities to make friends and find something to do on campus every day. There's a lot of good options for food, the residence halls are really nice to live in and the dorms themselves are nicely sized. The campus is small enough that walking to class isn't a big deal and if walking isn't your thing then the public transportation is really accommodating to most people's class schedules. Every aspect of Geneseo life can be praised, the only downside is the weather. But that is upstate New York, and nothing a good winter coat can't fix., 81561=food is available until 12:00 a.m. pretty good schedule, but do not expect delicious food. it is ok.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students As a prospective student SUNY Geneseo should not fall below your radar. Whether Geneseo is your safety school or your reach dream school, the academics and overall atmosphere should not go unnoticed. For any prospective college student my first tip would be to take a variety of AP classes. I entered Geneseo with 28 transfer credits which allowed me to erase some General Education requirements and start working on my major sooner. In addition, this may allow you to add on additional minors or concentrations in the future. Rather than focusing solely on one or two subjects of AP classes, taking a variety of different subjects will help you fulfill more General Education requirements. Though many may suggest being a well-rounded student and I agree that this is important, I would emphasize the importance of dedicating your time to a few activities, extra-curriculars or volunteer experiences that you truly enjoy. Colleges, especially Geneseo, like to see what you can bring to the college. Demonstrating that you have a strong interest or knowledge base in particular areas rather than shallow interests in a variety of areas may be more desirable to certain colleges. Geneseo loves diversity! If you have an experience that can speak to your tolerance of others, your multicultural background, or your interest in others it would be a great idea to write about it for an essay. Rather than focusing your essay solely on your own personal development,",
