The nation's highest-scoring freshman defenseman roofed a shot over Bonar at 1:48 of the opening period., 4144=The Crimson struck again on the power play to double its lead at 9:18 of the second period.

McNally head-manned the puck to Kroshus, who passed to Biega. The junior defenseman ripped a wrist shot over Bonar's shoulder that bounced out so quickly that the red light did not go on initially.

Patrick McNally, Marshall Everson and Eric Kroshus scored power-play goals, and Kroshus assisted on Danny Biega's even-strength tally that held up as the game-winner. Steve Michalek made several key saves and totaled 31 stops to send the Crimson (4-3-3, 3-3-2 ECAC Hockey, 1-2-1 Ivy League) into first-semester exams on a four-game unbeaten streak. McNally added two assists for his second straight three-point game, and Biega had one helper for his fifth straight game with two points. Marc Hagel scored twice to bring the Tigers (4-8-2, 3-6-1, 1-3-0) back from two goals down late in the second period. Sean Bonar made 22 saves as Princeton",
