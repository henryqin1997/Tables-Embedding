    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot First of all we are on a block system with new classes every three or six weeks depending on the block. Each block contains classes which if they are kitchen classes are everyday. These classes you will have hands on training as well as lectures on specific subjects. For example, in Cuisines of Asia you will have three days dedicated to just Chinese food. In addition to learning the specific techniques you will also learn of the geography, flavor profiles, and food styles specific to the different regions. An example of the academic classes, would be B-Block. This block contains the class: Introduction to Gastronomy, Culinary Mathematics, Product Knowledge, and Food Safety. Product Knowledge you will learn all about produce and their quality and condition, how to choose them and how to identify them. Food Safety allows you to learn about the risks of unsafe food. You will also study for the ServSafe test. There is also an 18 week externship where the students will apply for jobs in the industry and work. This allows the students to experience the industry and show them how its works, the process of applying to a job, network, and ultimately hone their skills in the kitchen. Although we take a plenitude of classes, we complete them in a shorter amount of time, which can lead to students unable to grasp the knowledge needed to pass.",
