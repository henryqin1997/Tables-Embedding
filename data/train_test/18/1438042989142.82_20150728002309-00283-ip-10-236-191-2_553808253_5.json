Guide: http://thecodecentral.com/2011/01/18/fix-ubuntu-10-10-suspendhibernate-not-working-bug Passing pcie_aspm=force i915.i915_enable_rc6=1 to the kernel (3.0) will decrease power consumption. The NVIDIA card is possible to turn off using acpi_call but this is considered highly experimental at the moment (may mess up your BIOS) but it seems to work for me (use at your own risk).
