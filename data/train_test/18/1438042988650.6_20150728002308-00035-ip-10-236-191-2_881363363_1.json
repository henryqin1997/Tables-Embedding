They'll play back-to-back shows in Los Angeles on September 17th and 18th, in San Francisco on September 21st and 22nd, and a one-night stand at New York City's famed Radio City Music Hall on September 25th., 3930=Over the course of several years, the band would hit both peaks and valleys. Their 2003 album, \"My Private Nation\" went platinum on the strength of \"Calling All Angels.\" But three years later, sales for \"It's You\" were the lowest of Train's career. Something had to give after Monahan nearly went solo, but he returned to Train in time for the band to issue its fifth album, the aptly named \"Save Me.\" The smash hit \"Hey, Soul Sister\" revived Train's career, and 2012's \"California 37\" sparked a tour across the East coast of the United States., 2645=Train Concerts Concert Tickets Ticket Prices Music Videos UPDATE: Train Tour 2013 Over the course of their career, Train has had eight Grammy nominations, three Grammy awards and has had significant radio and commercial success with singles such as \"Drops of Jupiter,\" \"Calling All Angels,\" \"Hey, Soul Sister,\" \"If It's Love,\" and \"Drive By.\" Having\u2026, 6573=Fans were quick to jump on any and all news about the new project back in May. After guitarist Jimmy Stafford tweeted, \"An anagram of the first single from the new @train album is now available! SGIJANNULAEBENEL. Yep,\" the social media savvy quickly responded with, \"Angel In Blue Jeans.\", 4814=The tracks were laid and the foundation formed for Train back in 1993, as Monahan left his hometown in western Pennsylvania and resettled in California. He played local gigs with Rob Hotchkiss, and the duo became a trio when it added Stafford to the mix. Once Underwood and bassist Charlie Conlin came aboard, Train was ready to pull out of the station., 6240=While that tweet stirred the pot in terms of fan enthusiasm, an announcement by Scott Underwood on June 5 put somewhat of a damper on the joyfulness. That's because Underwood posted a message thanking fans for their support and announced he was leaving the band to pursue writing, producing and other music-related ventures. The drummer, who has been with Train for two decades, was replaced by Drew Shoals., 3308=Train was seen in Times Square on New Year's Eve for a special performance of their new single, \"Mermaid,\" and the band has sold out performances in Europe through February 2013., 4443=It took roughly four years for Train to drum up interest \u2013 especially among record labels. When they finally signed a deal with Aware Records, the group's eponymous debut album in 1998 was self-financed. One track on the project, \"Meet Virginia,\" became a Top 40 hit, but Train wouldn't find the charts again until the stunning success of \"Drops of Jupiter\" in 2001. Monahan said the song was inspired by the death of his mother, and the opening lines came to him in a dream.}",
