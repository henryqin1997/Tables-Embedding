    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations For certain of the broader aspects of the invention, other forming techniques such as molding of a softened tube are possible for preparing the tapered preform. In various embodiments, the wall thickness of the tapered section can be increased or decreased according to the amount of draw performed during fabrication of the preform. In some embodiments, use of constraining elements in the end regions may be omitted, and in other embodiments the entire preform may be confined in a mold for determining the final blown shape. The temperature in other embodiments may be outside of the preferred ranges mentioned, provided certain relationships are maintained, see above, with reference to the thermal analysis curve for the respective resin (see the example for the preferred embodiment, FIG. 12, a thermal analysis curve for polyethylene terephthalale (PET), one preferred resin). A particular advantage is obtained when making the larger balloon sizes for assembly on small shafts, for instance an 8 mm balloon for the shafts described above. To form such a balloon, it is advantageous to choose a starting tube of diameter greater than the outer diameter of the shaft on which the balloon is ultimately to be mounted. By use of the drawing steps to form the preform, it is readily possible, in the defined heated regions, to draw the diameter of these regions to a size corresponding to the size of the shaft. After formation of the",
