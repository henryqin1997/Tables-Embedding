            "METHOD FOR THE PRODUCTION OF A DIAMOND ELECTRODE, AND DIAMOND ELECTRODE - A method for producing a diamond electrode comprising synthetically produced and electrically conductive (doped) diamond particles, which are embedded into a support layer of electrically non-conductive material. The doped diamond particles are introduced as a single layer between two films that form the support layer, the films then being permanently connected to each other and the diamond particles being exposed on both sides of the support layer.",
            "DROP-IN CELL FOR ELECTROLYTIC DISINFECTION OF WATER - The invention relates to a drop-in cell for disinfection of water from bathing pools, particularly whirlpools, with an electrolytic cell (",
            "METHOD AND DEVICE FOR DETERMINING THE CONCENTRATION OF OXIDIZING AGENT(S) IN AN AQUEOUS SOLUTION - In a method and a device for determining the concentration of one or more oxidizing agents in an aqueous solution flowing in a main stream, a partial flow of the aqueous solution is diverted to a bypass, wherein the difference between the potential of the aqueous solution before and after at least partial and/or selective breakdown of any oxidizing agents is measured. The bypass is for diverting and returning the partial flow of the aqueous solution, and has at least one elimination unit through which the aqueous solution flows for at least partial and/or selective breakdown of the oxidizing agent(s), and two measuring electrodes for determining the difference between the potentials of the aqueous solution before and after it passes through the elimination unit.",
            "DROP-IN CELL FOR ELECTROLYTIC PURIFICATION OF WATER - A drop-in cell for the electrolytic purification of water, for example bathwater or service water, with an electrolysis cell that can carry a flow of water, is built into an oblong, e.g., cylindrical, electrically insulating sheath or jacket, and has two contact electrodes mutually positioned a distance apart from each other. A float is situated at least at the one end region of the jacket.",
            "ELECTRODE, USE THEREOF, AND AN ELECTROCHEMICAL CELL - The invention relates to an electrode for an electrochemical cell, which is either a piece of a monocrystal grown from doped titanium dioxide or which contains a multiplicity of monocrystals grown from doped titanium dioxide.",
            "BATHING WATER, METHOD FOR THE PRODUCTION AND SYSTEM COMPRISING A BATHING OR SWIMMING POOL - The invention relates to bathing water on the basis of tap water, which is suitable for treatment by means of electrolysis. The bathing water contains at least one of the alkali metal ions Na",
            "FLUID BASED ON WATER WHICH IS ELECTROLYTICALLY TREATED IN AT LEAST ONE ELECTROLYSIS CELL AND USE OF THE SAME AS A CLEANING AND/OR DISINFECTION AGENT - A method for producing a cleaning and/or disinfecting water-based fluid, containing at least one cleaning and/or disinfecting substance with oxidative effect, characterized in that at least one fat-dissolving and/or lime-dissolving substance is added to the water in a dosing of, in total, at least 0.1 g/l of water, at least one salt from the group of citrates, acetates, tartrates or formates is used as lime-dissolving substance, at least one C14-C18 carboxylic acid or a sulfonate or a hydroxide is used as fat-dissolving substance, wherein the water is electrolyzed in an electrolysis cell having at least one diamond electrode."
