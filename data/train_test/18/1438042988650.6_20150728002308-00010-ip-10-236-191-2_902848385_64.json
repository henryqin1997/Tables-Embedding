Only about $2000 a semester., 2426=I have been at Trident since August of 2010 and so far I have nothing bad to say about the teacher and academic advisers who I have had or come into contact with. I have a full 15-hr schedule this semester and although my classes are all quite different and unique, I am learning many new things in them. One of my favorite classes is Western Civ post-1689; which may not sound important but it is because I usually resent history classes about western civilizations. This one however, I quite enjoy.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Do NOT get your books until after the start of classes. Some of the teachers do not even use the books that the bookstore tells you that you must have for the class. For my history class last semester, I never used the book at all. My English teacher for this semester told the class straight up that we would not need the books for her class either. If you are getting financial aid, make sure you apply early. The financial aid office has a history of pulling people around in circles and canceling grants at the last moment. Do not wait until the deadline to get things paid for. If you do not pay on time, then you lose your schedule and your classes and you have to re-register and hope that the classes are still available. Go to the first day of class! Most of the teachers at Trident will give notes on the first day of class, so make sure that you go. Bang for the buck You get what you pay for. Trident is a very in-expensive school. The classes are just enough to be able to transfer to a 4-year school. Scheduling can just be plain miserable since the system they have set up for that is not too effective. They do though have a really nice learning center that allows",
