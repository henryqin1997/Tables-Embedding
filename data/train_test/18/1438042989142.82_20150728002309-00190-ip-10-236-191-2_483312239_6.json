Accordingly, the particular arrangements disclosed are meant to be illustrative only and not limiting as to the scope of the invention which is to be given the full breadth of the appended claims and any and all equivalents thereof. It will be appreciated that an ovenable food product tray and an ovenable food product package have been disclosed. The food product tray and package contain two surfaces for printing indicia thereon, and is made of materials which produce a uniformly cooked and non-soggy food product. FIG. 8 also shows the collection reservoir 90 formed by the base which serves the dual purpose of collecting any loose toppings 92 from the pizza 12 and also any melted cheese 94 that cascades over the side of the pizza 12 while it is cooking. This latter function resists \"wicking\" which is when melted cheese comes between the pizza crust 96 and the floor member 20 and thus cause sticking of the pizza crust 96 to the floor member 20. It will be appreciated that the microwaves 82 will strike the floor member 20 and thus heat the floor member 20 to a very high temperature due to the presence",
