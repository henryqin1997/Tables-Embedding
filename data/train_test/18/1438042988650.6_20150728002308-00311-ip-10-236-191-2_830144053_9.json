More details (and screenshots) at https://sites.google.com/site/abudden/contents/Vim-Scripts/bandit-colour-scheme Unusual Features The colour scheme has a few slightly unusual features as Vim colour schemes go: Support for a lot more highlighting groups than most colour schemes (including the result of the ctags-based highlighter: vimscript#2646, and Dr Chip's rainbow.vim). Requires Vim 7 or above (I got irritated by the syntax for colour schemes, so I made my own) If you install the associated syntax file, it is self colouring, so you can see the colour scheme clearly when viewing",
