            "Professional Liability policies are written on a claims made basis. This means the Policy covers claims actually brought against an Advisor during the policy term, irrespective of when the error or omission took place. It is vital to ensure that all claims or incidents which may give rise to a claim (i.e. become known by the Advisor because of a complaint \u2014 written or oral \u2014 by the client or discovery by the Advisor of the error) are reported to the insurer during the Policy Period.",

            "Limits of Liability are chosen by the Insured at the inception of the policy.",
            "The deductible varies for Professional Liability policies.",
            "Professional Liability programs can provide defence costs either within the Limit of Liability or as an extra dollar amount.",
            "Any Professional Liability policy should have a provision to allow an insured to purchase coverage to allow for the reporting of claims after the termination of the policy. The extension should apply to all claims made in the future that have their origin prior to the termination date of the policy.",
