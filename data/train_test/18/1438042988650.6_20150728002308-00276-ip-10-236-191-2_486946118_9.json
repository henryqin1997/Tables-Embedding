    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{84943=Network link 1920 typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other devices. For example, network link 1920 may provide a connection through local network 1922 to a host computer 1924 or to medical equipment 1926 such as a radiation beam source or a switch operatively coupled to a radiation beam source. The data streams transported over network link 1920 can comprise electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals. The signals through the various networks and the signals on network link 1920 and through communication interface 1918, which carry data to and from computer system 1900, are exemplary forms of carrier waves transporting the information. Computer system 1900 can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), network link 1920 and communication interface 1918., 80752=The invention is related to the use of computer system 1900 for detecting and predictively estimating physiological cycles. According to one embodiment of the invention, such use is provided by computer system 1900 in response to processor 1904 executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in main memory 1906. Such instructions may be read into main memory 1906 from another computer-readable medium, such as storage device 1910. Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in main memory 1906 causes processor 1904 to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors in a multi-processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the sequences of instructions contained in main memory 1906. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the invention. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software., 81843=The term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to processor 1904 for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as storage device 1910. Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as main memory 1906. Transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise bus 1902. Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio wave and infrared data communications., 84053=Computer system 1900 also includes a communication interface 1918 coupled to bus 1902. Communication interface 1918 provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link 1920 that is connected to a local network 1922. For example, communication interface 1918 may be an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. As another example, communication interface 1918 may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface 1918 sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry data streams representing various types of information., 76056=FIG. 11 depicts an embodiment of a marker block 1100 having a cylindrical shape with multiple reference locations comprised of retro-reflective elements 1102 located on its surface. Marker block 1100 can be formed as a rigid block (e.g., from Styrofoam). Blocks made in this fashion can be reused a plurality of times, even with multiple patients. The retro-reflective elements 1102 can be formed from the same material used to construct retro-reflective markers 114 of FIGS. 7a and 7 b. The marker block is preferably formed from a material that is light-weight enough not to interfere with normal breathing by the patient., 79951=Computer system 1900 may be coupled via bus 1902 to a display 1912, such as a cathode ray tube (CRT), for displaying information to a user. An input device 1914, including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to bus 1902 for communicating information and command selections to processor 1904. Another type of user input device is cursor control 1916, such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to processor 1904 and for controlling cursor movement on display 1912. This input device typically has two degrees of freedom in two axes, a first axis (e.g., x) and a second axis (e.g., y), that allows the device to specify positions in a plane., 83042=Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to processor 1904 for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to computer system 1900 can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal. An infrared detector coupled to bus 1902 can receive the data carried in the infrared signal and place the data on bus 1902. Bus 1902 carries the data to main memory 1906, from which processor 1904 retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory 1906 may optionally be stored on storage device 1910 either before or after execution by processor 1904., 78770=FIG. 12 is a block diagram that illustrates an embodiment of a computer system 1900 upon which an embodiment of the invention may be implemented. Computer system 1900 includes a bus 1902 or other communication mechanism for communicating information, and a processor 1904 coupled with bus 1902 for processing information. Computer system 1900 also includes a main memory 1906, such as a random access memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device, coupled to bus 1902 for storing information and instructions to be executed by processor 1904. Main memory 1906 also may be used for storing temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions to be executed by processor 1904. Computer system 1900 further includes a read only memory (ROM) 1908 or other static storage device coupled to bus 1902 for storing static information and instructions for processor 1904. A data storage device 1910, such as a magnetic disk or optical disk, is provided and coupled to bus 1902 for storing information and instructions., 76756=A marker block can be formed into any shape or size, as long as the size, spacing, and positioning of the reference locations are configured such that a camera or other optical imaging apparatus can view and generate an image that accurately shows the positioning of the marker block. For example, FIG. 10 depicts an alternate marker block 1000 having a hemispherical shape comprised of a plurality of retro-reflective elements 1002 attached to its surface.}",
