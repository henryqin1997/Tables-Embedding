            "CSUN's campus is very calm, and there is police on campus. They even have their own office on campus. If you ever have any fears about walking to your car at night or walking to your dorm, you can have someone escort you. There are also blue poles spread around the campus that have a button you can press that signal someone to come to your location in a matter of seconds.",
            "There are over 300 clubs to choose from and be a part of. It is almost impossible to not find a club that interests you. And if there isn't a club that interests you, you can start your own with a minimum of 5 people.",
            "CSUN is great for all types of students. CSUN is a very diverse school, and does not support discrimination against any kinds of students. They always try their best to make every students college life as enjoyable as possible.",
            "One of the perks of paying tuition, is that you get access to the state-of-the-art gym. You also have access to the health center where you can get physicals, have your blood checked, and even get free eye exams and prescriptions.",
            "CSUN has many activities year round for it's students to be entertained. CSUN is also located very close to the mall where you can go to the movies, hang out with friends, or go shopping.",
            "There is a variety of places to eat at CSUN. For example, Subway, Pollo Loco, Panda Express and many other well-known food-chains, There are also many coffee shops spread out around campus for those nights when you have to stay awake in order to study for those pesky midterms and finals. If you get bored of the food on campus, there are many places within a 1 mile radius around CSUN that you can go to.",
            "Although CSUN is a school where the students like to have fun, the students also know that they have to work hard to get good grades in class. If you are taking 4 classes, you should be studying about 48 hours per week if you want to do well in class. Thats more hours than a full-time job requires.",
            "If you are a commuter student, arrive to school 30 minutes early in order to find a parking space. To all other students, arrive to class at least 5 minutes early in order to get your things ready for class. For every hour of class, you should be studying 2 hours outside of the classroom.",
            "CSUN is a campus where all the students feel welcome and safe. There are various ways to get involved at CSUN and there is always a lot of school spirit. You will rarely, if ever, encounter an unfriendly person at CSUN and the education provided at CSUN is excellent."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{136352=I highly recommend the dorms to the newly incoming freshmen so they can start many new people and have a great sense of community within the dorm life. Also there is events sponsors by the RA (Residental Advisor) with free movie screenings, ice cream parties, and even peer advisement. For exercise, their are volleyball nets, a small field for soccer, and basketball courts. The only downside is that the Matador Patrol closes the gates at 7:30 pm so if you need to enter to the dorms, you have to sign and verify with matador patrol before you enter., 1103142=As an Alumni, class of 2012, i really took advantage of all the opportunities that were offered to me in the School of Sociology. The professors are great and really allow you to learn skills that are practiced in the classroom so that you can immediately start using in the workforce. Professor Morgaine, Hatkoff, and Debose were my mentors, teachers, life coaches, and friends., 56915=I love CSUN,but if I were living on campus I would have a lot more fun.The sports are fun and it is easy to get involved with activities.The campus is beautiful and they are building a new Art center which is suppose to open in 2011.I also love the library because I always can find what I am looking for in there if I can't find it at my local library., 675507=I don't dorm, but I do live across the dorms, there is a curfew for getting inside without having to be checked in, they close the gates at 7:30. Also they are fairly overpriced, but I do still wish I dormed to meet new people., 235458=there are many fun events held at c.su.n. such as concerts by well known artists like b.o.b. and the cataracs, who performed in the fall semester, 2011. they recently built the student recreational center where students can become fit and active. best part it is free for students! during the hot weathers c.s.u.n. has a big pool where students can cool off., 75282=Great school. May not have the prestige of other schools like the UCs but it is one of the best CSUs in the state and has a great business program., 874348=I had no fun time. I tranferred in 2006 Fall semester from Mission College and I Graduated from CSUN in Spring 2008. My goal was to complete my BA as soon as possible because I was having a baby in Sep 2008. I had no time to see or do fun things at school... but study,go to class and take exams., 740882=I've been a student majoring in Civil Engineering here at Cal State Northridge since the Fall of 2007. I have seen the campus grow with student life and expand. CSUN has just finished building a new student recreation center, parking structures, updated technology in classrooms, and improved student life on campus. Overall I have enjoyed my years here and despite the large majority of peers commuting to and from, the student body can connect on campus. Go Matadors!, 714536=CSUN has an entire escort system that guards the library and personally approaches students to walk them either to their car or back to the dorms. Security guards have two shacks on the outskirts of Student Housing and patrol from 7:30 pm- 3:00 am. The guards are pretty cool, they actually like chatting with students and asking what's going on with them. They also patrol inside of Student Housing too., 597215=They are not acceptng new applicants until 2013., 739714=CSUN has updated their dormitory life since 2007 and provided better meals for on campus dining., 122576=This year 2012 the hired various security! Its really good., 987137=It`s no wonder than CSUN is ranked 68th in the 2013 edition of Best Colleges is Regional Universities (West) by US News. This school offers incredibly small class sizes which are ideal for getting the best of lecture time. CSUN`s vast variety of degree programs ensures than just about anyone can attend CSUN and study what he or she wishes.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here CSUN has given me the opportunity to explore my many different interests. I have helped out with student elections, blood drives, etc. I recently joined the New Student Orientation Team and J.A.D.E Program which has been an incredible experience so far. I have met some amazing, caring people through these programs and hope to befriend many more. Am learning a lot Almost all my professors have been extremely helpful, I have learned a lot not just from my professors but also my classmates. I have also learned a lot about the campus as well as myself in and out of the classroom.
