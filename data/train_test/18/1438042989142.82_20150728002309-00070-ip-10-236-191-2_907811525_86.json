            "In my experience, the men and women are kind and friendly and do their jobs very well. That being said, there was a letter from security posted throughout the school regarding a sexual assault that took place in an elevator one weekend. There was also an incident I heard about in which security responded to a possible threat involving a student with a gun that turned out to be fake. From what I understand, security acted swiftly.",
            "Greek life exists on campus with a full-range of social and professional fraternities and sororities.",
            "Again, the bulletin boards are the best sources of information for what happens on and around campus.",
            "There is a huge amount of diversity in the student body, so anyone looking for all the colors of the rainbow will be happy here.",
            "There is a quiet prayer room near the student union that always seems to be unoccupied.",
            "There are free copies of the NY Times available everyday, and the campus hosts several events throughout the year that students can either attend for free or at a huge discount that sometimes include free food. It would be nice, though, if the ASDS students had access to the new performing arts space that Pace opened this year. As previously mentioned, the prices for food and drink are questionable.",
            "There are campus activities posted on the bulletin boards all around school, ranging from language exchange groups to movies in the student unions and seminars/workshops/speaking engagements with prominent academics, entertainment professionals and politicians.",
            "The quality of the food varies, but, for the most part there is a healthy selection available in the cafeteria and the downstairs cafe that caters to all different kinds of diets. There is also a Starbucks in the cafeteria. The cost of food and drinks, however, seem to be somewhat inflated.",
            "I cannot speak directly to dorm life since I live off-campus.",
            "This is a very rigorous program academically, creatively, emotionally and physically. Successfully completing all the required reading and writing requires a huge time commitment and shrewd planning. Being proactive about staying healthy and getting enough rest is also crucial.",
            "Financial planning is very important since there are limited scholarships available from ASDS and Pace. Also, given the nature of the work, effective time management is obligatory. Having a life outside the program is also essential to maintain a sense of balance. It might also be good to bring in food from home since the prices at the various dining halls seem quite high.",
            "The Actors Studio Drama School at Pace University is a strong training program that is housed at Pace University. Pace has its own dramatic arts curriculum, and it is rare that the two cross paths. For the most part the facilities are adequate, though it would be nice if the ASDS students had access to the same performance spaces."
