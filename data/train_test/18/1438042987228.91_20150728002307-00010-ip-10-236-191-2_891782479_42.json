            "I always feel safe on campus. There are always security guards monitoring students coming into school, leaving. Also really late at night too! Even at 2 a.m The security is never over bearing, but it is nice to know they are there.",
            "CBU does not participate in Frats and Sororities, but this school does not need them!",
            "ASCBU, the student body committee is always planning different events. Including club fairs, trips to Disneyland, baseball games, and the beach.",
            "Anyone who wants to find a closer relationship with GOD or build one from scratch. CBU is very accepting of different religions. This university is a quiet and peaceful place. It has a very intimate feel to it.",
            "CBU has a first time freshman orientation class, called FOCUS. New freshman are randomly put into groups and during orientation week the FOCUS leaders help you get used to the campus. This is a semester mandatory class, and it well worth it! You meet great people and the FOCUS Olympics allows all FOCUS teams to compete against each other.",
            "CBU is one of the less expensive Private Christian Universities in California. Also it is cheaper than UC's. CBU tries their hardest not to raise tuition when under pressure by budget cuts.",
            "CBU constantly has events on the Front Lawn. Just last week we had an event called recess they brought jump houses and cotton candy machines. CBU also have a game room full of different things to do and places to socialize. Also discount on movie tickets!",
            "CBU is known for having one of the best dining commons. Endless food, that is always served fresh! You do not need to worry about food sitting out. They also have many options for students with different diabetic needs.",
            "I am a commuter student, so I do not live on campus. I do have friends who do, and i visit them so often in the dorms. I think it is an amazing opportunity for those who can live on campus. It is one experience that you should not miss out on, you build friendships that will last for the rest of your life.",
            "The professors here are amazing. Some are easier than others, but their main goal is to help you succeed! Small class sizes makes it easy to get to know your professor which allows for better communication.",
            "Keep your GPA up for the chance for scholarships from CBU. Have good test scores which can eliminate some GE classes that you would have to take.",
            "CBU has been one of the best experiences of my life. I have been able to meet great people and build long lasting friendships. Most of all CBU makes it easy to build your relationship with God."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{129352=the classes here are great. they the teacher to student ratio is about 1:21 but it is actually a lot smaller if i might add. i had one class with only 6 students! and trust me that is awesome. it might depend on the major you are also, but so far i have had only one class that was somewhat large and that was a general education class that is popular on campus, it is called marine science., 198016=Best college cafeteria food ever. Sunday brunch is to die for. People actually come from off campus to eat in out cafeteria. There is also a restaurant called Briscios that offers sandwiches, and salads. There is a new restaurant opening fall 2012 that is going to offer different types of pasta. All of these are options that use the meal plan., 94607=The facilities, classes, professors, food, student body, and the school itself are all fantastic. There are buildings that are still standing from when the school was founded in 1954, but they are all standing strong, and are diligently maintained. In addition to buildings that were there originally, California Baptist University has purchased much of the land around it, and continues making renovations on existing buildings, as well as recently built facilities, and buildings that are being constructed., 463048=On campus, one can visit the game room and play ping pong, pool, shuffleboard, or Foosball. There is also a recreational center being built which will have workout equipment, a pool, an above ground track, a rock climbing wall, and much more. This is projected to open in the spring of 2013., 39258=Woo fest, March Madness and the Man Auction are all great traditions and so much fun to participate in!, 246543=The CBU crazies march during homecoming, there are several cool spots too! For example, there is the fortuna fountain, the catacombs( unfortunately you cannot go down in them) and the front lawn in general is nice., 658978=There are many events on campus for the residence and commuter students. If any events are coming up there will be posters around campus, people will tell you during Chapel, your RA will post things in the living area and you can check lancermail to see what is going on. There are service events to help out the community and hang out with friends. During September we have TWIRP week were the girl ask the boys on dates the entire week. Also have midnight madness, christmas chapel and etc. Next semester we have WOO! same as TWIRP but instead the boys ask the girls and woo there affection. Just a munch of events to connects everybody together and meet new people., 25803=There are tons of fun things to do on campus at any given moment. I enjoy spending my free time playing Futsol(street soccer) with friends or having late night jam sessions with my band, or even just kicking back and watching a movie at amc with a 7$ ticket bought from campus life. Oh and did i mention that the mountians and beach are only 45 min away? Wooo! 4:1 ratio!, 322308=A very friendly environment. The staff as been awesome in helping me along the way for the 2012-2013 school year. I'm so excited for what the future has for me at cbu., 533345=Despite it's hefty price tag, I've only have had to pay 1200 out of my own pocket. I feel like I'm paying for Cal State tuition. :) Which is a plus. However, make sure you're able to pay for 2/3 of the tuition. If you end up having to pay for more than $10,000 through your own pocket, and loans, do not attend Cal Baptist. You'd be better attending another college or university. Also, only take out Federal Subsidized loans (and not even a single unsubsidized loan). Private loans will haunt you if you take them out. Believe the horror stories you read about those taking out private loans., 255431=They do TONS of free and fun stuff. On November 1st to kick off Homecoming they were able to get Switchfoot to come and gave out like 600 FREE TICKETS!!! AND!! The concert was in our very own gym! And for midnight madness instead of just regular tickets they gave out CBU watches., 23013=No frats sorry, but tons of great clubs! Baking club for example............4:1 ratio!, 734003=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Be prepared to study, write papers, and read more than you ever have before. Throughout my previous years in school I maintained a high grade point average, but I still have to work very hard to maintain such a high GPA in college. Do your best to get involved in at least one sport, club, or bible study group. The friendships, memories, and values you'll gain are life-changing and it will make you feel home away from home. Bang for the buck I will admit that CBU is very expensive, but so is every other private university. The christian environment, caring professors, and lifelong friendships you'll make guarantee that the high cost of enrolling at CBU is truly worth every penny! Am enjoying being here I am still amazed everyday at how much of a blessing it is to be attending CBU and to be able to live on campus. The faculty is so friendly and helpful. Even my professors truly care about my grade and they strive for me to succeed. The professors really care about you as a person and they are available to help with school or even things that aren't school-related. I love my school and I can't imagine being anywhere else! Am",
