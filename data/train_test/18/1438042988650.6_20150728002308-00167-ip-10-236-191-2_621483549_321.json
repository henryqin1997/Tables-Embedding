Mono- to hexa-chlorobenzenes are observed between 800 and 1150. K, and the extent of chlorination was proportional to the combustion temperature. Higher chlorinated congeners of chlorobenzene (tetra-, penta-, hexa-chlorobenzene) are only observed in trace amounts between 950 and 1050. K. DFT calculations indicate that cyclisation of chlorinated hexatrienes proceeds via open-shell radical pathways. These species represent key components in the formation mechanism of chlorinated polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Results presented herein should provide better understanding of the evolution of soot from combustion/pyrolysis of short chlorinated alkenes., 93803=Performance of chemical looping combustion processes can be improved drastically by enhancing the overall redox characteristics of the system through the use of binary mixtures of oxygen carriers. However, binary mixtures of oxygen carrier particles are often found to differ in both size and density and therefore have the tendency to segregate under certain operating conditions.In this work, a numerical study was conducted to investigate the mixing and segregation behaviour of binary mixtures of particles with different sizes and densities in a bubbling fluidized bed under conditions pertinent to the fuel reactor of a cold flow model (i.e. a non-reacting replica) of a 10kWth chemical looping combustor. The motion of particles was tracked individually by discrete element model (DEM), whilst the gas flow was modelled by computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Gas-particle interactions were considered by a two-way coupling method. Further, a modified version of Lacey's method was developed to calculate the mixing index, taking into account both the heterogeneity of solids spatial distribution and particle size differences.Results showed that the modified Lacey's method provided very consistent and stable mixing indexes, proving to be effective for an in-situ quantitative description of mixing. It was also found that as the size ratio of the binary mixture of particles reduced, the mixing index increased indicating better mixing conditions. The agreement between the DEM/CFD model predictions and the experimental data was found to be satisfactory. The optimum conditions for mixing of binary mixtures appeared to be a function of bubble size, bubble rising rate and bubbling dynamics (e.g., splitting and coalescence). Application of the DEM/CFD model for prediction of layer inversion phenomenon in gas-solid fluidized beds was also demonstrated. \u00c2\u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V., 106582=An experimental investigation was conducted to explore the rate of flame spread over an unconsolidated porous bed of sand wetted with 2-propanol under a range of operating conditions. Video cinematography was employed to determine the rate of flame spread and characterise the combustion behaviour of the system. The rate of flame spread strongly correlated with: (i) the ratio of fuel volume to the weight of the sand bed, referred to as FR, and (ii) the flame initiation delay, referred to as FID. The rates of flame spread associated with no initiation delay cases were found to rise with increasing FR while for cases associated with any given flame initiation delay the rate of flame spread was found to decrease with increasing FR. In addition, the rate of change in flame spread was observed to be different for beds containing finer particles in comparison to those containing coarser ones. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd., 98626=This study experimentally investigates the application of a solid-liquid micro-fluidised bed as a micro-mixing device. The experiments were performed in a borosilicate capillary tube with an internal diameter of 1.2. mm (i.e. near the upper-limit dimension of a micro-fluidic system) using borosilicate particles with a mean diameter of 98 \u00c2\u00b5m. Refractive index matching technique using sodium iodide solution was employed to achieve a transparent fluidised bed. Mixing performance of the micro-fluidised bed in terms of mixing time was investigated using a dye dilution technique. Experiments were carried out in the creeping flow regime at Reynolds numbers ranging between 0.27 and 0.72. It was demonstrated that the micro-fluidised bed mixing time sharply decreases as the Reynolds number increases. That is because at relatively high Reynolds numbers, the particle oscillation is stronger creating larger disturbances in the flow. The energy dissipation rate in micro fluidised bed was estimated to be four orders of magnitude less than other passive micro mixers which operate in the turbulent regime. It was also demonstrated that the ratio of mixing time and the energy dissipation rate for fluidised bed micro-mixer was comparable to K-M, Tangential IMTEK, and interdigital micro-mixers. However, the fluidised bed micro-mixer was found to operate at much lower Reynolds numbers compared to other passive mixers, with a mixing time of the order of few seconds. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 The Institution of Chemical Engineers., 464978=Two University of Newcastle academics have been honoured with prestigious accolades at the 2014 NSW Science and Engineering Awards., 465838=April 15, 2014, 84363=In this study the transition from homogeneous to heterogeneous flow in a solid-liquid fluidized bed (SLFB) is examined both experimentally and numerically. The experimental apparatus comprised a refractive index-matched SLFB, comprising 5. mm diameter borosilicate glass and sodium iodine solution, which allowed for both instantaneous particle image velocimetry of the liquid flow field and solids hold-up measurements to be undertaken for superficial liquid velocities in the range of 0.06-0.22. m/s. The motion of individual, spherical steel balls (with diameters 6, 7, 8, 9. mm) was then tracked as it settled through the fluidized bed for differing superficial liquid velocities. It was observed that, for all the steel balls covered in this work, there was a change in slope in their respective classification velocity curves at a superficial liquid velocity of 0.08. m/s. This value was very close to the critical velocity of 0.085. m/s predicted from 1-D linear stability analysis; and therefore deemed to be the critical condition that marked the transition from homogeneous to non-homogenous flow. It is proposed that the change in slope of the classification velocity curve is due to the encounter of the settling foreign particles with liquid bubbles whose presence marks the onset of heterogeneous flow. Additional computational analysis, involving both Eulerian-Eulerian (E-E) and Eulerian-Lagrangian (E-L) approaches, is used to confirm the presence of liquid bubbles at a critical liquid hold-up of 0.54, which corresponds to that predicted from 1-D linear stability analysis. In summary, the study has highlighted that experimentally the transition condition for a SLFB can be obtained simply by observing the behavior of the classification velocity of a single foreign particle at different superficial liquid velocities. This transition condition was found to agree with the 1D linear stability criterion, Eulerian-Eulerian CFD (3D) and Eulerian-Lagrangian DEM (3D) approaches. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V., 89267=Integrated Chemical Looping Air Separation (ICLAS) offers an energy efficient and cost effective option for large-scale oxygen generation in oxy-fuel type power plants. Oxygen production in the ICLAS is achieved by reduction of oxidised metal oxides in an environment of steam/recycled flue gas (CO2-rich) using a dedicated reduction reactor. This paper provides the results of a thermodynamic investigation into the effect of flue gas impurities on the reduction of three metal oxide oxygen carriers (Cu, Mn and Co oxides) under conditions pertinent to an oxy-fuel coal-fired power plant. Relevant calculations were carried out using the Fact-sage 6.1 thermodynamic equilibrium calculation software package. Different gas streams, namely crude/wet, dry, pure CO2 and steam were considered in the simulations together with the additional hypothetical impure flue gas stream having larger concentrations of CO, SO2 and NO. Effects of SO2, NO, CO and O2 contents of the flue gas on oxygen carrier conversion and oxygen decoupling process were investigated in detail. It was established that the successful reduction of metal oxides in the presence of flue gas impurities can only be achieved at higher temperatures due to increased partial pressure of O2 and the formation of metal sulphates at temperatures less than 800-900 \u00c2\u00b0C. This may increase the operating and capital costs of the CLAS based oxygen production. \u00c2\u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, char-supported sorbents were prepared by loading iron, cerium, and molybdenum into a Chinese lignite through co-precipitation, and the sorbents were used for dry desulfurization of coke oven gases. Desulfurization efficiency of the sorbents was examined using a fixed-bed reactor in a temperature range of 473-673 K using a simulated coke oven gas. A gas chromatograph equipped with both a flame photometric detector (FPD) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to analyze gas composition, while X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were used to examine chemical phases and the dispersion pattern of the active constitutes of the sorbents. The experimental results showed that the highest desulfurization efficiency and sulfur capacity appeared at 673 K. The reactivity of the nanosized active components in the char increased with increasing the desulfurization temperature in the temperature range of 473-673 K. In the case of Fe-Mo-impregnated sorbents, Fe and Mo combined together to form complex Fe-Mo oxide phases. The introduction of Mo in the sorbent is found to greatly increase the sulfur capacity and desulfurization efficiency of the Fe sorbent supported on activated chars. The addition of Ce leads to noticeable improvement of the performance of Fe sorbent during sulfidation. The mechanisms and factors influencing the sulfidation reactions have also been discussed. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 American Chemical Society., 104011=Fires caused by accidental spillage of flammable liquids have been a major safety concern in industries and urban areas. There has been a recent surge of interest in the research concerning the combustion and flame spread over an inert porous media soaked with flammable liquid. This interest has been driven by the need to better understand fire and its behaviour under these conditions and improve the relevant fire safety and prevention technologies. A review of key studies in this subject area has been conducted and summarised, focussing mainly on the theory plus a notable experimental findings about combustion and the flame spread phenomena of fuel-soaked porous media. The review covers topics such as flame spread behaviour, physical flame propagation aspects, heat transfer, temperature distribution; and fuel consumption over inert porous media. The review concludes with some practical safety and environmental considerations for decontamination of land soaked with flammable liquid. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved., 464072=A UON revolutionary clean energy technology scooped the pool at the 2015 Newcastle Engineering Excellence Awards., 464888=October 21, 2014, 71349=This experimental study was conducted to investigate the rate of flame spread over an inclined porous solid (sand) wetted with finite quantities of fuel (iso-propanol). The study comprised experiments that were conducted over 15\u00c2\u00b0 and 30\u00c2\u00b0 inclined beds with depths ranging from 13.3 mm to 39.9 mm and consisting of average sand particle diameters ranging from 0.5 mm to 5 mm under quiescent, assisted and opposed airflow conditions. Analysis of the resulting data indicate that the rate of flame spread is significantly decreased by increasing the bed inclination angle or the airflow velocity and is applicable for both assisted and opposed directions. Furthermore, the rate of flame spread is decreased to the minimum value and actually ceased halfway along the bed with a 30\u00c2\u00b0 inclination angle. This behaviour was observed mainly for beds containing coarse sand particles. The rate of flame spread was higher for thinner beds rather coarse beds under any given airflow conditions. Finally, the rate of flame spread in upward direction was relatively quicker in comparison with downward direction counterpart. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved., 109067=In a typical chemical looping combustion process, the oxygen for fuel combustion is supplied by circulating metal based oxygen carriers between two interconnected fluidised bed reactors. The redox characteristics of oxygen carriers and hence the overall performance of the process can be significantly improved by utilising binary mixtures of oxygen carrier particles. The full potential of such multi-species particle systems however can be only realised when particles segregation is minimised. This study is concerned with gaining an understanding of the mixing and segregation behaviour of binary mixtures of oxygen carrier particles with different sizes and densities in a cold flow model representing a 10. kWth chemical looping combustor. The hydrodynamics of such systems were investigated and compared with a typical chemical looping combustion process where single species are used. This was followed by investigating the solids mixing and segregation behaviour in terms of segregation intensity and species weight percentage at each reactor as a function of operating parameters. It was shown that increasing the total solid inventory, particle terminal velocity ratio, composition, and air reactor superficial velocity increases the riser pressure, solid circulation rates, and riser solid holdup. Mixing and segregation regimes of the fuel reactor and the component segregation between the two reactors were also mapped. The results showed that, for mixtures of species with low terminal velocity to high terminal velocity ratios of greater than 0.7, a good mixing in the fuel reactor can be achieved by maintaining the superficial gas velocity to the mixture minimum fluidisation velocity ratio above 5. For the tested conditions, the component segregation between the two reactors was avoided by maintaining the ratio of the riser superficial velocity to the terminal velocity of the species with a high terminal velocity between 1.25 and 2. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V., 46555=Abstract Greenhouses typically employ conventional burner systems to suffice heat and carbon dioxide required for plant growth. The energy requirement and carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel burner are generally high. As an alternative, this paper describes a novel greenhouse calcium looping process which is expected to decrease the energy requirements and associated carbon dioxide emissions. The conceptual design of greenhouse calcium looping process is carried out in the ASPEN Plus v 7.3 simulator. In a greenhouse calcium looping process, the calcination reaction is considered to take place during day time in order to provide the required optimum carbon dioxide between 1000 and 2000 ppm, while the carbonation reaction is occurred during night time to provide required heat. The process simulations carried out in ASPEN indicates that greenhouse calcium looping process theoretically attributes to zero emission of carbon dioxide. Moreover, in a scenario modelling study compared to the conventional natural gas burner system, the heat duty requirements in the greenhouse calcium looping process were found to reduce by as high as 72%., 52041=In a liquid fluidised bed system, the motion of each phase is governed by fluid-particle and particle-particle interactions. The particle-particle collisions can significantly affect the motion of individual particles and hence the solid-liquid two phase flow characteristics. In the current work, computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method (CFD-DEM) simulations of a dense foreign particle introduced in a monodispersed solid-liquid fluidised bed (SLFB) have been carried out. The fluidisation hydrodynamics of SLFB, settling behaviour of the foreign particle, fluid-particle interactions, and particle-particle collision behaviour have been investigated. Experiments including particle classification velocity measurements and fluid turbulence characterisation by particle image velocimetry (PIV) were conducted for the validation of prediction results. Compared to those predicted by empirical correlations, the particle classification velocity predicted by CFD-DEM provided the best agreement with the experimental data (less than 10% deviation). The particle collision frequency increased monotonically with the solid fraction. The dimensionless collision frequency obtained by CFD-DEM excellently fit the data line predicted by the kinetic theory for granular flow (KTGF). The particle collision frequency increased with the particle size ratio (dP2/dP1) and became independent of the foreign particle size for high solid fractions when the fluidised particle size was kept constant. The magnitude of collision force was 10-50 times greater than that of gravitational force and maximally 9 times greater than that of drag force. A correlation describing the collision force as a function of bed voidage was developed for Stp>65 and dP2/dP1=2. A maximum deviation of less than 20% was obtained when the correlation was used for the prediction of particle collision force. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd., 36370=An experimental study was conducted to identify the most suitable alumina-supported iron-based oxygen carrier for the abatement of ultralow concentration methane using a chemical looping approach. This was done by evaluating the performance characteristics such as reactivity, cyclic stability, and gas conversion. The experiments were carried out in a thermogravimetric analyzer and a fixed bed reactor setup under the desired conditions. Thermodynamics analysis was carried out using the commercially available software ASPENPLUS. The analysis suggested that the favorable iron-based oxygen carriers were those with the weight content of Fe2O3 less than 50 wt %. Three Fe2O3/Al2O3 samples were therefore prepared with the metal oxide contents in the range of 10-45 wt %, i.e., Fe10Al, Fe25Al, and Fe45Al. The thermogravimetric analysis experimental results showed that the reduction reactivity and stability were improved with the addition of support material compared with unsupported Fe2O3. Moreover, the reduction reactivity varied with the solid conversion range and the weight content of the parent material. For full reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, the sample Fe10Al showed the highest reduction reactivity. However, in terms of the rate of oxygen transport (which considers the combined effects of the oxygen transfer capacity and reactivity), the highest value was achieved by the Fe45Al sample. The gas conversion of CH4 to CO2 was also quite dependent on the weight content of Fe2O3. Essentially, Fe45Al delivered the longest duration on high-level conversion (i.e., complete conversion of CH4 to CO2). In summary, Fe45Al was found to be the most suitable oxygen carrier candidate in this application. The effect of operational parameters was further examined with various reaction temperatures (873-1073 K), methane concentrations (0.1-1.5 vol %), and CO2 compositions (0-50 vol %)., 463986=June 1, 2015, 63775=Release of fugitive methane (CH) emissions from ventilation air in coal mines is a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Approximately 64% of methane emissions in coal mine operations are the result of VAM (i.e. ventilation air methane) which is difficult for use as a source of energy. A novel ancillary utilization of VAM was thereby proposed. In this proposal, the VAM was utilized instead of air as a feedstock to a chemical looping combustion (CLC) process of coal. In this case, FeO/FeO particles were shuttled between two interconnected reactors for combustion of syngas produced by an imbedded coal gasifier. The effect of VAM flow rate and methane concentration on the performance of CLC was analyzed thermodynamically using Aspen Plus software. Results indicated that the variations of air reactor temperature with VAM flow rate and methane concentration can be minimized as expected. The effect of temperature and inlet methane concentration on the conversion of CH was examined experimentally in a fixed bed reactor with the presence of particles of FeO/AlO. Not surprisingly, the reaction temperature put a significant influence on the conversion of CH. The conversion started at the temperature about 300 \u00c2\u00b0C and the temperature to achieve full conversion was around 500 \u00c2\u00b0C while the temperature in empty reactor between 665 \u00c2\u00b0C and 840 \u00c2\u00b0C. This is due to the catalytic effect of oxygen carriers (i.e. FeO/AlO) on the conversion of methane. Moreover, it was observed that the methane conversion rate decreased with the increase in inlet methane concentration while increasing with FeO loading content. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved., 17218=Abstract Methanol economy is considered as an alternative to hydrogen economy due to the better handling and storage characteristics of methanol fuel than liquid hydrogen. This paper is concerned about a comprehensive equilibrium thermodynamic analysis carried out on methanol production via an innovative Chemical Looping Carbon Arrestor/Reforming process being developed at the University of Newcastle in order to reduce both energy consumption and carbon emissions. The detailed simulation revealed thermodynamic limitations within the Chemical Looping Carbon Reforming process however on the other hand it also confirmed that the new concept is a low energy requirement and low emission option compared to other methanol production technologies. Specifically, the mass and energy balance study showed that the Chemical Looping Carbon Reforming process typically consumes approximately 0.76-0.77 mole methane, 0.25-0.27 mole carbon dioxide, 0.49-0.50 mole water, and 0.51 mole iron oxide (in a chemical looping manner) per mole of methanol production. Moreover, the energy efficiency of Chemical Looping Carbon Reforming process was found to be ~64-70% and its emission profile was found as low as 0.14 mole carbon dioxide per mole of methanol, which is about 82-88% less than the conventional methanol production process and well below the emission levels of other emerging methanol production technologies., 55697=The interactions between vitrinite and inertinite-rich coals and the ionic liquid butylimidazolium chloride ([bmim][Cl]) heated to 100 C have been characterised. Differences in the interactions of coal macerals and ionic liquids have been identified. [bmim][Cl] is able to dissolve 22 wt% of a high-vitrinite coal fraction compared to 14 wt% of a high-inertinite coal fraction. The vitrinite-rich coal fraction tends to swell to a greater extent compared to the inertinite-rich coal fraction, which was fractured and fragmented rather than swelled. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved., 49208=The correct calculation of cell void fraction is pivotal in accurate simulation of two-phase flows using a computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method (CFD-DEM) approach. Two classical approaches for void fraction calculations (i.e., particle centroid method or PCM and analytical approach) were examined, and the accuracy of these methodologies in predicting the particle-fluid flow characteristics of bubbling fluidized beds was investigated. It was found that there is a critical cell size (3.82 particle diameters) beyond which the PCM can achieve the same numerical stability and prediction accuracy as those of the analytical approach. There is also a critical cell size (1/19.3 domain size) below which meso-scale flow structures are resolved. Moreover, a lower limit of cell size (1.63 particle diameters) was identified to satisfy the assumptions of CFD-DEM governing equations. A reference map for selecting the ideal computational cell size and the suitable approach for void fraction calculation was subsequently developed. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers., 470412=A UON revolutionary clean energy technology scooped the pool at the 2015 Ne..., 479876=Copyright 2015 CRICOS Provider Number 00109J The University of Newcastle, Australia, 77393=The chemical looping air separation (CLAS) is a novel method for producing high-purity oxygen, which can be effectively integrated to oxy-fuel power plants. CuO/Cu2O, Mn2O3/Mn3O 4, and Co3O4/CoO have been found to be the most thermodynamically suitable oxidation pairs for the CLAS process. In the current study, the reactivity and stability of these metal oxides were analyzed further. A total of six different oxygen carrier samples were prepared by the dry impregnation method on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports. Their redox behavior has been investigated in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) at four different temperatures, i.e., 800, 850, 900, and 950 C, where the temperature-programmed oxygen release and oxidation were applied for 5 continuous cycles using nitrogen and air, respectively. The results indicate that, although relatively all oxygen carriers exhibited good reactivity, CuO/Cu2O with SiO2 and Co3O4/CoO with Al2O3 were found to be most stable. Furthermore, oxygen transport capacity (OTC) (%) and rate of oxygen transport (ROT) (% min-1) were calculated. It was found that Cu oxide with SiO 2 has the highest OTC of 4.77% as well as the highest ROT of 5.1 and 10.9% min-1 for oxygen release and oxidation, respectively, at 950 C. The CuO/SiO2 oxygen carrier also exhibited better stability for the 41 continuous cycle test, with only 10.3% loss in OTC compared to 22.3% for Co3O4/Al2O3. The grain size growth was found to be the key cause in the loss of OTC. The oxygen concentration in the outlet stream for the CuO/SiO2 oxygen carrier was measured in packed-bed experiments at different temperatures. It was observed that the oxygen concentration at the outlet of the reactor was consistent with the equilibrium values at studied temperatures. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 American Chemical Society., 58119=The loaded salts (NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, and CaCl2) have significantly different influence on the contribution of dehydration and depolymerization reactions to the decomposition of sugar structures during cellulose fast pyrolysis at 325 \u00c2\u00b0C. The structures of salt-loaded celluloses already become cross-linked during heating-up period, largely due to the enhanced dehydration reactions catalyzed by inorganic species. As stronger Lewis acids, the alkaline earth metal ions (Mg2+ and Ca2+) are more effective than the alkali metal ions (Na+ and K+) to catalyze the dehydration reactions of sugar structures, leading to the formation of more cross-linked cellulose for the alkaline earth metal chloride-loaded celluloses. As a result, the majority of Mg and Ca are transformed into water-insoluble forms during the heating-up period, largely reducing the catalytic effects of these species on the dehydration of sugar structures during the subsequent isothermal pyrolysis. Rather, the dehydration of non-sugar structures is enhanced because the catalytic species are already bonded with non-sugar structures. In contrast, the dehydration of sugar structures during the heating-up period is less significant for the NaCl-loaded and KCl-loaded celluloses. The majority of Na and K are water-soluble after the heating-up period so that the dehydration of sugar structures is further enhanced during isothermal pyrolysis. The loaded salts have less influence on the depolymerization reactions. The contribution of depolymerization reactions to sugar conversion is relatively small during the heating-up stage, but increases substantially during isothermal pyrolysis. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
