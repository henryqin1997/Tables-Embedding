During our stay, we have been maliciously cheated 3 times! The first cheat happened when we asked the consierge to help buying performance tickets. When the staff at the consierge gave us the tickets, they did not mention anything about service charge, just told us the cost of each ticket is 2500 pesos. The cost number on the tickets had been blackened that we could not see it anymore. The staff took 5000 pesos in cash without giving us receipt. Based on the trust of such classic/beautiful 5 star hotel, we did not have any doubt about these points. But after we visited the Colon Theater and found the cost of the same performance (same seat position) was only 1090 pesos, we were very surprised and angry. This is not only the money issue, this is the trust issue. So we came back to hotel and asked for receipt, The difficulty began, here let\u2019s omit 10,000 words. Finally after discussing back and forth for more than 1 hour, they returned us 2000 pesos, which means 2 tickets they charged 820 pesos(Usd92.0) without notice in advance. The 2nd cheat happened when we asked the consierge to book car service. The staff introduced us 2 options with a lot of smile on his face: private taxi (driver can speak a Little bit English) usd25.0 per hour, hotel\u2019s car usd43.0 per hour. We chose the private one. When we got off the car , the driver asked us to sign on the car use note, but we noticed there is no timing showing, of course we remembered the timing of car use. When we read the hotel bill we found the car service charge is 43 dollars and the car usage hour is 1 hour more. We were angry and asked for mangager to explain., 87104=February 20, 2015, 88633=February 16, 2015, 69066=Right in Puerto Madero, only 1300 ft from the Women\u2019s Bridge, Hilton Buenos Aires offers accommodations in a stunning building.
