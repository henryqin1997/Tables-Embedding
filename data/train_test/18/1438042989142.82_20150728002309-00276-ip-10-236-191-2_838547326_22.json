            "Moa'ki Harbor: Take the flight (automatically learned) from Warsong Hold to Dalaran. Use the teleportation crystal to port down to Crystalsong Forest. Avoiding wolves, ride through the southwest part of the zone into Dragonblight. It will be convenient for later NPCs to pick up the flightpath at Sunreaver's Command, close by to the entrance of Dragonblight--a little more inconvenient for Horde than for Alliance, but still easy to reach. Once in northern Dragonblight, you'll be in a gauntlet with 80+ worms--it's good to die. Take the spirit rez at The Crystal Vice. This will have saved you some travel time and place you right at the Path of the Titans, an aggro-free road. Take the Path all the way down, past Wyrmrest Temple. When you reach the sea, turn right and hop down the cliffs. You'll now be at the Moa'ki Harbor beach--the town is nearby.",
            "D.E.H.T.A.: Surprisingly, getting this from Warsong Hold is trickier than it would seem because the nearby roads are covered in hostile mobs. It's best to do after getting either the Moa'ki Harbor or Star's Rest NPCs, because the eastern roads in Borean are devoid of mobs. Ride west from Star's Rest (or take the boat from Moa'ki Harbor to Unu'pe in Borean). The green patch on the minimap will have some level 70 mobs, but you can ride pretty far mounted up. The wildlife around D.E.H.T.A. is not hostile.",
            "K3: If you've picked up the Sunreaver's Command flight path earlier, fly back here. You'll be at the northeastern part of Crystalsong Forest--you may die a few times as not all mobs are neutral in the eastern half, so stick to the border with mountains. The initial entrance to The Storm Peaks will be devoid of mobs. There will be a few kobolds as you head east to K3, but you should be able to stay mounted up.",
            "Westfall Brigade Encampment: If you've gotten Elder Tauros in Zul'Drak already, this will be easy. Start from Zim'Torga, going onto the main road to the north, always bearing to your right. The wide path will take you right into Grizzly Hills, from which it continues as a winding road, again without aggro from mobs. Keep following the road south, and you'll soon find the Elder outside the settlement."
