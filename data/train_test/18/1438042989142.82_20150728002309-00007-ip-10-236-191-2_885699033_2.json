The Nets must now be creative in their approach to not only improve the team, but keep their current pieces in place. Gerald Wallace, the player acquired from Portland for the top-three protected pick, will be an unrestricted free agent. The Nets might also need to get a bigger piece, though dreams of Dwight Howard seem to be implausible, to convince point guard Deron Williams to return., 13466=The New Jersey Nets dropped the final game of the 2012 season to the Toronto Raptors by the score of 98-67 at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, ON on Thursday. The offense was paced by guard Armon Johnson's 11 points, 3 rebounds, 5 assists and 4 steals. Power forward Ed Davis led the Toronto offense with 24 points, 12 rebounds, 2 assists, one steal and a block. The loss gave New Jersey better overall odds in the NBA draft lottery, but little else in a season that will likely be forgotten once the team moves to it's new stadium in Brooklyn next year., 14268=Hello, Brooklyn! It has been 55 years since the residents of Brooklyn have had a professional sports team to cheer for. To the delight of those in attendance at the news conference on Monday, the Brooklyn Nets unveiled their color scheme and logo. And as part owner Jay-Z might say, they're Bed-Stuy fly! The excitement for the Nets in Brooklyn cannot be denied. This is sports history in the making! However, the front office has a lot of business to take care of with regard to the roster before the 2012-13 season begins. Who will they select in the upcoming draft? Can they resign Deron Williams? Will they acquire Dwight Howard? If so, Brooklyn residents and the borough's distinct vibe will surely fill the billion-dollar Barclays Center on a nightly basis to cheer for the Nets., 12894=5/4/12 The New Jersey Nets are now, in effect, the Brooklyn Nets, as the transformation has become all but official. The Nets released their new Brooklyn apparel as they prepare for their move across the river, leaving their New Jersey home behind. The Nets will look to add some young talent in the upcoming NBA draft, and will also hope to take the core of their current team over to Brooklyn with them, which includes their star point guard Deron Williams, whose future with the Nets is still uncertain. The Nets will open up the 2012-2013 NBA season at the brand new Barclays Center.}",
