    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{93513=This school, by far, has the greatest value of all the Kentucky public schools. It is still under $10,000 per year for undergraduates, and room and board is affordable as well. As of 2011, a four year program in total is less than $35,000, and the school offers numerous scholarships, in which most students qualify. There are scholarships offered for the children and relatives of alumni, for students who reside within Campbell, Boone, or Kenton county, for those who have attended Scott High School, and also scholarships for students from certain neighborhoods. NKU has the most value for those who are from its surrounding communities, as it is a very community driven school., 598916=Campus police are friendly and ever present. NKU is also away from any crime prone neighborhoods. There are usually one to maybe two reported crimes on campus per year. Last year, someone held a lighter up to a ceiling pannel in an elevator, effectively burning a 1/2 diameter hole in it. The year before that, someone was described as urinating in a parking lot. I started in 2011, and those are the only campus crime alerts that have been issued between then and now., 501819=I have only spent one night in the dorms at Orientation but I have already talked to all four of my new roommates through text messages. I think it will be a great part of college and I am really looking forward to August., 642573=There is so much to do for fun at NKU. I'm still learning about all of the different clubs and organizations around campus and still have so much to learn! I am auditioning for the spring musical in January and am SO excited to be a part of the amazing drama club., 784757=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 753205=With all of this snow we've had in 2013-2014, the security and police officers here on campus have gone the extra yard to make sure everyone is safe., 6650=This school is perfect for students that have a drive to succeed. The Honors program is one of a kind, and is something that high-ranked students should look into. It's great for students that want to be involved as well! Students interested in informatics should definitely consider NKU, as we are one of 3 schools in the nation with a college of informatics. A new state-of-the-art building is also in the works, and is planning to open in Fall 2011. NKU is NOT a party school. It is mainly a commuter school, but students that live on campus usually leave on the weekends. It is a quiet campus and there are no frat/sorority houses., 673950=Get your orientation scheduled quickly and apply for housing as soon as it opens or you'll be stuck as a temporary. Complete your FAFSA as soon as January 1st, and be patient with the financial aide office. Other than that, schedule your classes to how you feel that you could handle them best, relax, and enjoy college life., 641100=I intend to joing NKU's theatre department sometime in January, I've alwasy been part of musical theatre and NKU is the perfect place to continue my love for performing., 523902=-Polar Bear Run, students streak with limited clothing in December around campus and jump into the campus lake for chairty -Fashion shows on campus plaza -Skyline Chili -Big named music bands play at The Bank of Kentucky Center on campus., 689564=Griffin Hall houses the College of Informatics. The building opened in the Fall of 2011, and is a building that fits modern stylings. The whiteboards in the classrooms are an entire wall, with special paint to allow them to be used in that sense. Also, there is a digitorium, which is a room that allows for interactive events to occur on campus. For example, the screen is the size of the wall, and can be split into many different inputs. Also, it allows for technology to be utilized when there are events in which students can interactively vote anonymously, through the usage of a special device., 7478=Take a campus tour and APPLY EARLY! First year scholarships are the biggest, but the deadline for consideration is in mid-January. Many of the merit scholarships are renewable, so having them really adds up. Also, applying early gives you an earlier orientation date, and there's a much larger class selection that way!, 635013=Definitely a good school in regards to academics. But the quality of life here is terrible. NKU is a commuters institution that isn't friendly to independent outsiders. Everyone on campus has known each other from high school and are not accepting to strangers. Sure you make some friends, but it all turns out to be like high school again; the drama and lots of immaturity. I could go on about how this place disgusts me. So glad I'm transferring after this Fall 2013}",
