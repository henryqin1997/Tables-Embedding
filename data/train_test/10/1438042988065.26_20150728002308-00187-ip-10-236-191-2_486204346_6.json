Lowry; John W., 15071=The sheets unbulked have a thickness ofabout 2 mils and a bulk thickness of about from 45 to 60 mils. The sheets are irradiated after embossing to an extent of 12 megarads and stretched 4:1 in each direction., 24501=After the sheet is formed or patterned it is passed to the irradiation chamber 75 which has an MEV generator. The sheet is passed through the irradiation chamber at ft. per minute and receives a 6 MA dose of 9 MR at ambient temperature. This cross-links the sheet and thereby provides its memory of the variation in surface. Other cross-linking means could be used. The important element here is that a memory of the variation in surface that is existent in the material be expeditiously set so that with subsequent elimination of the pattern to provide a substantially flat sheet of plastic this pattern will be all the same retained within the sheet itself. It has been found that the irradiation chamber is a most expeditious means of providing the crosslinking to the patterned plastic sheet. The patterned plastic sheet then passes from the irradiation chamber 74 to a thickness reducing means which includes a preconditioning heating means 76 which in FIG. 10 is a reservoir of water heated to 212F and this adjusts the sheet temperature to the sheets orientation temperature after which the sheet is transferred to a stretching means. A tenter frame stretches the sheet until it is unbulked or unpatterned to the intended extent. The sheet 72 is biaxially stretched on the tenter frame 16:1, 4:1 in each direction. The sheet is preferably stretched from 9:1 to 20:1 biaxially in the usual case. This yields a flattened sheet having a thickness of about 2 mils. Of course depending on the desired application other thickness may be produced. After orientation the sheet is maintained in its stretched, restrained condition until air cooled at ambient conditions. The sheet is then rolled into a compact form for storage in subsequent uses. Of course, it could be formed into sheets or even passed directly to a bulking facility at some other area if desired. This might be particularly true if the sheet is to be used to wrap the product prior to bulking as previously described in one specie., 9218=[22] Filed: Sept. 30, 1970 [21] Appl.
