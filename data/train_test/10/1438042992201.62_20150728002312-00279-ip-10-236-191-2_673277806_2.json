The target genes of each transcription factor overlap extensively: POU5F1, SOX2, and NANOG co-occupy at least 353 genes (Boyer et al. 2005). About half of POU5F1 targets also bind SOX2 and about 90% of these also bind NANOG (Boyer et al. 2005). Upon binding the transcription factors activate expression of one subset of target genes in the core transcriptional network of pluripotent stem cells and repress another subset (Kim et al. 2006, Matoba et al. 2006, Player et al. 2006, Assou et al. 2007, Babaie et al. 2007, Chavez et al. 2009, Jung et al. 2010). The target genes listed in this module are the repressed genes. Caution must be used when making inferences about human stem cells from mouse stem cells because of significant differences between the two species (Ginis et al. 2004).}",
