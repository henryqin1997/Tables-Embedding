            "Students who like small classroom settings, students who are willing to sit out on a few Friday nights in order to get some work done, and students who appreciate a competitive nature will excel at Duke. But most importantly, in order to really enjoy your time at Duke, you need to be relaxed and know how to balance work and play.",
            "1. Whip out the Halloween costumes every other Saturday and attend football tailgates. 2. You HAVE to go to at least one basketball game and/or tent out for the UNC game, but don't forget to study the cheers beforehand. 3. Get your faculty in resident to approve you for a chapel climb. Don't forget to bring your camera. 4. If you're sick of the Marketplace or Great Hall, head over to Franklin Street for some great restaurants. 5. Study, study, study. Everyone pulls six hour shifts in Perkins Library, so don't feel like a complete nerd when it's your turn.",
            "For such an expensive school, Duke still sucks every penny that you have left out of you. A parking pass is around $300 and you WILL get at least 3-4 parking tickets in your years here. In addition, the club sports and Greek fees are ridiculous. However, the fact that your professor probably wrote the textbook you're studying and the daily maid service in the dorms definitely make the financial crunch worth it in the long run.",
            "The students and faculty at Duke are extremely receptive and interesting people. There is never a boring day as long as you take the time to get to know those around you. Everyone is from around the world, which has really opened my eyes to different perspectives and cultures. We have a great Greek life, sports program, and events of all sorts every day of the week. The campus is beautiful and the Raleigh-Durham area is an exciting regions, especially with UNC and NC State both within a 20 minute drive. However, as I'm one of the few students who migrated north for college (I would say a large percentage of the population is from the Northeast), I detest the frigid, cold, windy, and rainy winters.",
            "In high school, I found that I could ace any class with a study cram the night before any test. By doing this, I never truly learned anything. Sure, I remembered enough for the tests and exams, but if someone were to quiz me a week later, I would have had no clue as to the answers. At Duke, the small classes and interactive environments along with the extremely specific details of some courses makes it impossible not to know what you're studying. I would have to admit that in the three semesters I've been in college, I've learned more than I ever learned throughout high school."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{39332=In general, dorm life is pretty standard. There is a new housing model (will be starting in the 2012-2013 school year) that is intended to foster stronger bonds between people living in the same dorm. There is also a brand-new dorm on West Campus with beautiful rooms that people are very excited about., 109436=First of all, Duke is a very difficult school to get admission into. This school is the most selective university in the Southern United States. If you are submitting SAT scores, you MUST submit results of SAT II Subject Tests (2 tests required.) Failure to meet this will potentially jeopardize your application. To get in, you should have a consistent record of high academic achievement and perfect SAT scores for a competitive application. At the same time, don't worry if you don't have a 4.0 GPA and a 2400 SAT score - Duke's admissions are entirely holistic and are really much concerned who you are as a person. Strengths in other areas will compensate for grades that are less than ideal. Duke loves the academically motivated and intellectually curious student who is often willing to undertake challenges. That student should be able to be challenged by their peers/professors as much as they are willing to challenge them. Last of all, you should dedicate yourself to one or two activities you love and demonstrate only one thing: Impact. Remember that Duke, along with other universities such as Princeton, Yale, MIT all look for future leaders who are willing to make a difference in their community., 268411=- Go to the activity fair to see what is available for you to join on campus, and you get a lot of cool free stuff - Join Greek Life! - Go to as many sporting events as possible. Even if you are not that into sports, the energy and vibe at the games is something that makes Duke unique. - Try to ration your food points Freshman year, in March when you just can't possibly eat at the Marketplace any more you will be happy to still have another option -If you have a car, bring it. It's sometimes nice to get off-campus to go grocery shopping at the nearby Target or Kroger, and there are two malls about 10-20 minutes away, 222739=Tenting: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krzyzewskiville http://dukegroups.duke.edu/kville/k-ville-tenting-policy-2010-2011/, 280710=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 201991=Use your AP and IB credits; Duke is not somewhere you want to retake a course. Be prepared to be in the midst of literally 1500 high school valedictorians in your class alone. Everyone works hard and really cares about their performance, so don't think you'll be able to breeze through.}",
