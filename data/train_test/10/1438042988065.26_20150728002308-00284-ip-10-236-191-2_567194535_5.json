Apparently the bios update 07SU from samsung does address this issue. However the updated 10SU firmware still has this issue. This can be worked around by adding acpi=off to the grub kernel line. As you may have guessed disabling the ACPI means you have no battery meter and removing or pluging in the power adapter causes the machine to restart. Also please be aware that the fn keys do not work and the brightness keys will cause the machine to restart. Although you can re-bind the fn keys and there are various work arounds. Hopefully the ACPI will be resolved soon which will make this a most excellent machine for Linux. I recommend using the NVIDIA drivers for linux as well. Link",
