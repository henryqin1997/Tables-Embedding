    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{18736=The invention relates to a device for the indirect, non-invasive and continuous measurement of blood pressure in a finger by using a photo-electric plethysmograph having a pressure cuff, to be placed around the finger and to be filled with fluid, and associated light source and light detector, an electronic circuit, and an electric control valve having at least one fluid flapper-nozzle system, the cuff pressure being controlled by the plethysmographic signal in closed-loop operation such that the arterial volume is maintained on a pre-adjusted value, and each deviation thereof due to changes in intra-arterial pressure is immediately compensated. Such a device is known from the article \"Beitrag zur fortlaufenden indirecten Blutdruckmessung\" by J. Penaz, A. Voigt and W. Teichmann in \"Zeitschrift fur die gesamte innere Medizin und Ihre Grensgebiete\" VEB Georg Thieme, Leipzig, Vol. 31 (1976) part 24, page 1030-1033.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The length of the connection between control valve and pressure cuff is in this case of importance as the pressure change effected by the control valve does not propagate through the line 5a faster than the sound velocity in air of 340 m/sec. Owing to this, some delay in the control loop comes about which can lead to instability. By giving the control valve a small dimension and light weight among others by using the presently available small electro-magnetic coupling motors for the movement of the flapper, this valve can be positioned near the pressure cuff and the finger or hand in a light loading manner, such that this delay is minimized. For the sake of having a lighter embodiment a piezoelectric element can be used to advantage instead of a coupling motor. The requirement for compensating the pressure in the artery as soon as possible by means of the pressure of the pressure cuff, such that the transmural pressure continuously equals zero, necessitates the complete control loop to operate extremely fast and the control valve to alter the pressure immediately in response to the signal of the electronic circuit. For this purpose, for example, a piezo-electric element can be used to advantage for controlling the flapper. An extremely effective device for the control of fluid flows and pressures and for the measurement of blood pressure in the finger is realized by means of the above",
