    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{41376=Multiplying the 1.5 unit height times the 1152 pixel height yields an array height of 1728 units. For proper aspect ratio, 1728 units is multiplied by 16:9, equalling 3072 units wide. Going back to triangle 718, it shows that one unit is 3(2\ufffd3/2) pixel widths, so the array is 3072 units/3 pixels widths per unit, equalling 1774 pixels wide. Therefore the final array has dimensions of 1774\ufffd1152. Using hex pixels does not significantly lower the active area of each pixel. The area of a square pixel is 172, or 289 square microns. The area of a hex pixel is 282 square microns. As an additional benefit, hexagonal pixels, such as pixel 710, more closely approximate a circle than do square pixels and hence give have a more uniform response in the spatial frequency domain which can be an advantage in display systems (REF)., 36996=In the case of US-HD (as in MUSE decoders) an apparent short-cut to digital rescaling might seem to be to convert the 1440 pixel, decoded digital data stream to analog and then resample it at 1707 pixels per line. The problem lies in the digitization already inherent in the incoming signal. A certain set of algorithms have been used to sample the original analog waveform, and reconverting that sampled signal to analog and redigitizing runs the risk of inducing a new set of interference artifacts between the two sets of algorithms or a reduction in the bandwidth available for display, using antialiasing filters., 23242=The data is then passed to processor unit 116. Processor unit 116 then converts the data into the proper format for display on a selected spatial light modulator. For a reference point, a spatial light modulator of 2048 pixels across\ufffd1152 pixels down will be assumed, which corresponds to the highest resolution format currently proposed for HDTV, having a 16:9 aspect ratio. It is also assumed that the SLM has \"square\" or 1:1 aspect ratio pixels. As an example, if 960 line data of a format that has been proposed for US-HD transmission is to be presented at the proper 16:9 aspect ratio the data must be converted to have 1707 pixels per line. Digital processing must be performed to do this conversion even though US-HD is transmitted in digital, \"prepixelized\" form, since the standard transmits less that 1500 pixels on each of the 960 lines. Without digital conversion of the 1500 pixels to 1707 pixels, an apparent vertical elongation of objects, by about 15%, will occur on the display. No matter what final data format is chosen for US-HDTV, digital scaling will be necessary if non-square pixels are distributed, a highly likely prospect due to the bandwidth limitations of the 6 MHz NTSC channels., 34952=The face of a spatial light modulator such as the DMD is depicted in block diagram format in FIG. 5a. The outer box 510 represents the edges of the active modulation area, again assumed to be 2048\ufffd1152 pixels. The full active area of this modulator represents the resolution required to portray HD-MAC or wide PAL signals. The inner boxes show other various formats and their respective positions on the face of the modulator (not to scale). Box 514 shows the fit of baseband MUSE or SMPTE 240M format data, which is 1920\ufffd1035. Boxes 516, 518, and 520 all have the same number of rows, 960., 35562=Box 516 has 1707 columns, which represents the resolution needed to present HD proper 16:9 aspect ratio 960 line images. Since 960 is twice the current NTSC format, it's common belief that the US-HDTV format will have 960 lines to simplify back-compatibility. Box 518 represents the image that would result if one of the proposed US-HD standards, decoding 1440 columns, were displayed without rescaling. Box 520, 2 times the NTSC standard, is 1280 columns. As can be seen by the block diagram, all of the formats will fit onto the face of the modulator, but the US-HD image would be compressed approximately 15% in the horizontal direction from its proper 1707 column dimension. This distortion would be objectional when viewed. US-HD is the only digital standard shown here and would have to be rescaled using one of the techniques discussed above (or a similar technique)., 40080=An additional advantage is the close packing of the pixels, shown in FIG. 7. This arrangement requires 13% less pixels to fill a give aspect ratio area with a given number of horizontal lines than does a square pixel array: All of the sampling patterns that normally require 2048\ufffd1152 pixels can be achieved in 1774\ufffd1152 pixels. This reduction in size likewise reduces the amount of memory in the associated electronic system, lowering the expense. Further, this also reduces the surface area, making the manufacturability increase with respect to current steppers and reticles. The dimensions of the array are derived as follows, referring now to FIG. 7. If the side of the pixel 710 is said to be 1 unit, then the distances 712 and 714 are both 0.5 units. The distance 716 is determined by the geometry of the triangle 718 formed on pixel 710. The triangle is formed by the 1 unit side, a bisector of the lower angle of the hexagon (leaving a 60-degree angle), and the line running perpendicular to the side of the pixel 710. The triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle with hypotenuse of 1, and sides of 0.5 and \u221a3/2. Therefore the distance 716 is the same as the 0.5 side. Therefore, the height of each pixel, drawn from middle of post 720 to middle of post 722, equals 1.5 units., 16270=This is a division of applications Ser. No. 08/091,852, filed Jul. 14, 1993., 24491=If NTSC standard video of 480 line resolution is to be presented on the same display at its standard 4:3 aspect ratio, the incoming signal that is analog, as are most of the proposed and existing HD standards, can be digitized to the proper aspect ratio by sampling at 640 pixels per horizontal line. The sample data can be doubled in two dimensions to achieve a 1280\ufffd960 display, or, after digitization, more complex digital techniques can be used to create an interpolated 1280\ufffd960 pixel image.}",

The relative merits of each are shown. Each system will support various combinations of NTSC, HD-MAC, Baseband MUSE, and US-HD formats. Depending upon the processing approach, the total system costs and performance will vary. Proposed in the chart above is the cost implications of each system. The system comprises SLM 118, digital processing unit 116, and tuner/preprocessor 114. Conclusively, any system which requires US-HD will benefit by 26% cost savings. Another option for the electrode structure is shown in FIG. 8b. It is very similar to FIG. 8a, except that the electrodes are the top layer, and the landing region is underneath. In this case, the landing regions would need to be tied together underneath the electrodes. An advantage of this could be that the amount of voltage required to attract the mirror could be reduced, since the surface area generating the electrostatic attraction would be increased. However the electrodes are structured, the line-at-a-time reset remains an advantage that makes this particular structure particularly suitable for the",
