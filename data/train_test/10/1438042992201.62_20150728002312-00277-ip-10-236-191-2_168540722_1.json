All it would take is for the offense to keep hitting and the pitching staff as currently constituted to build us up a nice lead by the end of August, say 9 or 10 games, and then play .500 ball in September. So you need Gio and Stras and JZ to keep up their level of work, and Det and EJax to step it up just a notch. It can be done., 25797=nats lady \u2013 trip was great. got to go for a run in rome and florence in my 2005 nats hat. and everything else was great, too. saw our daughter sing in florence at st petes.and heared some charlie and dave on the wifi/MLB app during \"day\" games.still no word from the anthem guy ;-/gyfng, 140841=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows.

Usually 7:30 pm starts. I think they even do Sunday Night games there during the summer regardless of ESPN because of the heat., 1011=ATLANTA \u2014 I know it was a rough night and has been a rough day for many of you back in the D.C. area. Here's hoping everyone is managing to stay cool and that some of you are getting your power back. We had no storms here in Atlanta, but it's equally as hot, maybe hotter, with the thermometer expected to top out at 104 degrees right around 4:05 p.m. today when Stephen Strasburg and Mike Minor take the mound at Turner Field., 127658=JD, I am with you. I have no faith in Lannan or any of the other guys in Syracuse. Rizzo will have to decide if this is the year or not. Personally, I don't think it is, and he should not blow a bunch of prospects, rather wait for a full year of Stras and a more mature Harper in 2013. I'm not giving up on this season, don't get me wrong, but it would have to be very lucky., 153336=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC. Images provided by Getty Images.
