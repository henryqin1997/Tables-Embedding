    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students UW-Waukesha is great campus for anyone! Students who don't know what major they want to go into yet, students who do know but want to save some money, students who really don't know if college is quite for them. I really love this campus and I truly know that it has helped me grow as a person. Tips for prospective students I would tell new students to really open up and try getting involved in activities. The more activities you become involved in the more people you meet and more opportunities will arise, such as an officer position or a job on campus. Even if you only get involved in one club, have fun with it. UW-Waukesha has a very supportive student body and faculty staff that will do nothing but encourage you to have the time of your life. Bang for the buck At UW-Waukesha there are many scholarship opportunities if you have trouble affording the already reasonably low priced tuition. The only gripe I might have is the high text book costs, but no matter what college you go to the texts books will be expensive. Am enjoying being here I love the friendly enviornment UW-Waukesha has to offer. All",
