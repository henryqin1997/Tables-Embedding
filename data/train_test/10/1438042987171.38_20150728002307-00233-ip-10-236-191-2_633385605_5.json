Mangrove destruction in Thailand, 1961-1979, 48897=To obtain basic knowledge of mangrove communities, the United Nations University supported a research project on the socio-economics of dwellers in mangrove forests. Field study was carried out from September 1983 to June 1984 in the villages of Ko Lao and Had Sai Khao, both in Ranong Province in southern Thailand., 62534=Source: Sarigabutr et al. 1982., 45157=Rapid increase of population. During the years 1950-1981, the population of Thailand grew at an average annual rate of about 2.7 percent. The rate of increase is now below 2 per cent as a result of family planning programmes. Population growth led to urban expansion and to increased demand for agricultural land. Since upland and lowland areas were already occupied, large numbers of people have moved to coastal areas, including mangrove forest areas, but no data are available on the size of the areas affected., 38806=Source: Chaitiemvong 1983., 36564=Culture fishery. Of the total marine shrimp production in Thaiiand in 1979, about 6 per cent, 7,000 tons, was from coastal aquaculture (see table 5). Most of the aquaculture farms in Thailand, particularly shrimp farms, are in the mangrove forest zone in Samutsakorn, Samutsongkram, Samutprakarn, Surat Thani, and Nakornsrithammarat provinces. About 62,400 ha of the total mangrove forest area in Thailand is suitable for shrimp aquaculture (National Research Council of Thailand 1977). The 7,000 tons of shrimp produced in1979 came from 3,378 farms, occupying a total area of about 24,675 ha. Production was thus only about 284 kg per hectare. This low figure suggests that most of the farms are not very productive. In general they have been found to be productive only for the first three or four years of operation and are often abandoned after that. This practice is inefficient and very wasteful, resulting in the degradation or destruction of large areas of mangroves, and may in turn adversely affect the yield of coastal shrimp capture., 63022=The mangrove forest. A Mangrove Research Station was established in 1983 about 4 km from Ko Lao and 3 km from Had Sai Khao, and since then the forests have been reserved for research. One concession for forestry, based at Ngao, about 10 km from the research area, had been granted before the research station was established. That area is now reserved for ecological studies of the mangrove ecosystem. Because of selective cutting in this mangrove forest for many years in the past, the forest is composed mainly of small, closely spaced trees. The average stem volume of this forest is only about 10 m\u00b3 per ha (Kooha 1983). Only parts of the forest, particularly those near Had Sai Khao village, are composed of large trees, especially Rhizophora apiculata and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, with a diameter at breast height exceeding 60 cm and an average stem volume of about 120 m\u00b3 per ha (Jintana et al. 1983) (fig. 4), 13406=TABLE 1. Area of mangrove forests in Thailand by province, estimated from 1979 Landsat satellite imagery, 62578=Climate. The climate is humid tropical. There is little variation in mean monthly temperature, with the values between 25.5\u00b0 and 28.3\u00b0C. Annual rainfall is about 4,320 mm, the highest in Thailand. Most of the precipitation falls during the rainy season, from April to November. There are about 204 rainy days per year. A summary of climatological data for Ranong Province between 1951 and 1975 is shown in table 7., 45693=Aquaculture. Aquaculture, especially shrimp and fish farming, is widely practiced in the mangrove area. Shrimp and fish ponds have been built by clear-cutting the mangrove forest, levelling, and building embankments. The area of shrimp farms increased from 12,867 ha in 1,568 farms in 1975 to 24,675 ha in 3,378 farms in 1979 (table 5), not including areas converted to aquaculture and then abandoned without replanting., 35678=Capture fishery. More than 1.7 million metric tons of marine fish and crustaceans were caught in Thailand from 1979 through 1980(table 4). Of this amount, almost 120,000 tons were shrimp, which fetch the highest price per kilogram and are often most abundant in or adjacent to mangrove areas. Of the total shrimp production, about 6 per cent was from coastal aquaculture (much of it in mangrove zones), 22 per cent from small-scale fishing (mostly mangrove capture fishery), and 72 per cent from large-scale fishing (mainly off-shore operations). Many of the shrimp from large-scale fishery are mangrove-dependent species (e.g. Penaeus merguiensis, Metapenaeus spp.). The degradation or reduction of mangrove areas could adversely affect the coastal fisheries, particularly the capture of shrimp (Martosubroto and Naamin 1977; Gedney, Kapetsky, and Kuhnhold 1982)., 46135=Mining. Hydraulic tin mining in the mangrove area has been carried out mostly in Ranong, Phangnga, and Phuket provinces. Mining results in the deposition of large quantities of silt in stream channels and in the intertidal and near-shore zones. The extent of tin mines in the mangrove forest was approximately 926 ha in 1979 (Klankamsorn and Charuppat 1982), but the area affected by siltation from tin mines was much larger than this., 28824=TABLE 3. Production of charcoal from mangrove wood in Thailand, 1978-1982, 11156=Mangrove forests in Thailand occur on seashores, around lagoons, and along rivers at levels between low and high tides, in the southern and southeastern parts of the country and the upper part of the Gulf of Thailand (fig. 1). The extent of existing mangrove forest in 1979, as estimated from satellite imagery, was approximately 287,308 ha, or 1,795,675 rai (Klankamsorn and Charuppat 1982). A breakdown of mangrove areas by province is shown in table 1. Out of the total, 176,653 ha (61.5 per cent) is managed by the Royal Forest Department. The remaining areas are private property, and some are classified as unproductive forests., 37631=TABLE 4. Marine fishery production in Thailand, 1974-1980 (metrics tons), 47078=During the period 1961-1979 the total area of mangrove forest converted to various purposes was about 80,592 ha (Klankamsorn and Charuppat 1982). Table 6 shows that the rate of destruction of mangrove forests was high from 1975 to 1979, about 6,348 ha per year, as compared with 3,943 ha per year from 1961 to 1975.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "TABLE 3. Production of charcoal from mangrove wood in Thailand, 1978-1982 Poles. Mangrove poles are used for many purposes where water-resistance is needed -especially for foundation pilings, ore-rinsing troughs, and fishing stakes. The quantity of wood used for these purposes is minimal, however, and no data are available on the total amount. Mangrove species commonly used for poles are Rhizophora apiculata, R. mucronata, Ceriops sp., Bruguiera spp., and Excoecaria agallocha. Excoecaria agallocha seems to be more widely used than the others. Firewood. Wood from mangrove forests is also widely used by mangrove dwellers and people who live along the coastline as firewood. No data are available on the amount of firewood consumed per year per species. The mangrove species commonly used for firewood are Avicennia, Xylocarpus, Excoecaria, Bruguiera, and Lumnitzera spp. Rhizophora spp. are also used for firewood but only in small quantity because these species are preferred for charcoal. Charcoal. About 90 per cent of the wood harvested from mangrove forests is used for charcoal production. Various species of the Rhizophoraceae can be used to make charcoal, but Rhizophora apiculata and R. mucronata, which produce heavy, dense, hard charcoal with a high calorific value that is almost smokeless when burned, are preferred. Other species, such as Bruguiera spp. and Ceriops sp., are also used but in minimal quantity. The minimum size of stems for charcoal burning is about 5 cm. The average harvest is about 783,780 m\u00b3 of wood per year, which produces about 387,800",
    "textAfterTable": "Source: Royal Forest Department. a. With 30-year rotation. Construction materials. Mangrove lumber is used for house construction mainly by people who live in or close to the mangrove forest. Wood of various mangrove species can be used for different parts of the house. Rhizophora, Avicennia, Bruguiera, and Xylocarpus are commonly used for columns, bracing members, beams, and roof frames. Floors and platforms are made only of Rhizophora and Bruguiera species. Unfortunately the quantity of mangrove wood used for construction has not been recorded. Fishing gear. Various types of fishing gear are used by mangrove dwellers, and some of the equipment is made of mangrove wood. Poles from Rhizophora spp. are usually used for crab traps. The crab most commonly caught in the mangrove area is Scylla serrate. Drift gill nets and winged set bags also use mangrove poles; Rhizophora apiculata and Bruguiera spp. are the species commonly used for this purpose. The volume of wood used for fishing gear is small. Tanning. Mangrove bark is now only rarely used for tanning in Thailand. Formerly tannin from Rhizophora and Ceriops was used by fishermen for dying their fishing nets, but now they mainly use nylon nets, and little tannin is used for dyeing nets. Medicines. Mangrove dwellers in Ranong Province, on the west coast, have reported that they commonly use various mangrove species for medicines. Acanthus ebracteatus and A. ilicifolius are used to treat kidney stones, Bruguiera parviflora is used to relieve constipation, Avicennia alba",
