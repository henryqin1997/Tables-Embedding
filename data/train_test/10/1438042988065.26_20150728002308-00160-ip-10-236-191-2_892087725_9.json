            "Campus is super safe! There are walking escorts at all hours, security at pretty much every corner and there are constantly patrolling officers, so you can feel secure. Dorms are extremely secured, and there are a list of numbers to campus police, penn ride, and other resources that every student is encouraged to have. I do!",
            "I'm not a part of greek life, so I couldn't really judge it, but it does seem to be pretty big on campus! However, its not overwhelming. If you think it's not your scene, then that's cool too!",
            "The amount of clubs and activities here at UPenn are almost innumerable! There are so many options to choose from, and if you name it, there will most likely be that group on campus. If not, you can easily make your own club or team if you'd like to see it on campus. The clubs and activities are tailored toward any type of student and personal interest so every person can find something fun and favorable to do on campus.",
            "Any student!",
            "There is this thing called the button and it's actually pretty awesome. It's a statue of a button in the middle of campus and its super fun to look at and play around. I mean, what other school has a button, but it also serves as a monument so as to help guide people through campus. Also, there is also a church on the campus, in one of the educational buildings! Super cool!",
            "Yes, UPenn is expensive, but with all that the school has to offer, I'd say it's worth it!",
            "GO DOWNTOWN! There is so much to do downtown and even on campus. Downtown there are art and music festivals, exhibits and museums, shopping centers, parks, and clubs! On campus, there is ice skating, performing arts shows, sports games, gyms for recreations, and festivals. There is just so much to do, I can't list it all!",
            "Food on campus isn't too bad. It's not the best food, but UPenn does offer many food options, so if something doesn't quite fit your taste, there is always something else. Plus UPenn is located in the city, so there are plenty of off campus restaurant options.",
            "DORM LIFE IS SUPER AWESOME! UPenn offers residential programs, which is where a group of students who have similar interests are placed in the same hall and the hall (throughout the year) studies this topic. The dorms are relatively small, but with the activities being done in the hall, such as study breaks and hall trips, make it worth while.",
            "University of Pennsylvania, like any college, is pretty tough. Courses at UPenn are particularly challenging because they explore the topics thoroughly. The professors and curriculum encourage you to explore topics in ways that promote thinking in a different way than just memorization. You learn not just by memorization, but through application. The professors push you to truly grasp the material, and understand it in a way that creates a more meaningful perception of the topic at hand. However, the professors make learning material so much easier, because of their willingness to aid you and their passion for the material they are teaching.",
            "Dear Prospects, some tips are 1.REACH OUT FOR SUPPORT. Often when students go to large schools like this, which house up to 15,000+ students including graduate students, it can be a bit intimidating and overwhelming at first. This can leave people feeling like a lost puppy in an amusement park, but do not fear! There are so many support groups on campus, upper class students willing to help out a freshman, and teachers willing to sit down and give you advice in your trying times! Believe me, it is easy to feel alone and weak, but by reaching out you will find transitioning easier. 2.TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT THE SCHOOL OFFERS YOU. UPenn is a great school with many opportunities, from helping you land your dream job, or helping you figure it out, to giving you the chance to study abroad in a different language for a year. The university has so many clubs and student government groups, its amazing and taking full advantage of the resources the school offers you, can not only benefit your social life, but also your professional life as you work alongside professors doing research or become the leader of the student union. 3.FIND WAYS TO RELIEVE STRESS. At any collegiate level academic environment there is stress. Whether it be the personal stress of performing well academically, or the stress of feeling like there is just too much to do and not enough time, it is crucial to find your personal way of relieving stress. For me it was dance. For you it might be going to an art exhibit every Saturday, or going to Pottruck gym for yoga sessions or (if you're hardcore a weight lifting class!), or going ice skating at the Penn ice rink, or downtown shopping with your buddies! Whatever it is, find it and do it! 4.EXPLORE PHILADELPHIA. At UPenn you have the unique experience of going to school in one of the most awesome cities nationally! Like what is not to like about Philadelphia! The more you explore the city the more enchanted you will become with all it has to offer you. You will discover places that you never knew existed and its super fun to hop on the trolley (WHOO!) and head downtown for a shopping trip, or walk around Olde City, which is awesome! You will find the transition to college so much easier. 5.Lastly, DON'T BE AFRAID TO CALL HOME! Most people feel like when they go to college, they have the ultimate freedom and they will totally not miss home in the slightest and then they get there and feel kind of sad. Now, I'm not saying call home every second of the day, but you'll probably find(like I did) that you'll miss it, and sometimes in the most stressful times, it's pretty awesome to call home and hear a familiar, comforting voice. That's it for all, hope you come to UPENN!",
            "The University of Pennsylvania is honestly a wonderful school. There are so many opportunities here for academic exploration, for jobs, and even for social comfort. The diversity of the campus, truly makes it a great fit for pretty much every student."

I admit I did not have the best score for applying to this school (1900 and 30 ACT) it didn't stop me from applying. Keep your hopes up, be active in your home, school and community and it will give you that fighting chance., 285296=There are three dining areas at each end and the middle of campus. 1920 Commons was hit or miss but Hill was pretty good., 150203=Awesome social experience, whether or not you're on a hall with people that become your best friends. I was on a particularly quiet hall. Though I was disappointed at first, I soon came to appreciate the peacefulness of my living environment. Every time I wanted to get rowdy, I'd walk down the hall or across the quad to my friends' halls. My room was the size of a closet and we had co-ed, less than desirable bathrooms, but the experience of living with over 1000 other freshman in a 1800s castle was well worth it. Being able to walk outside and sit on the grass on a sunny day to listen to music or do your homework while your best friends surround you playing frisbee or walking to class is an unmatchable freedom., 317513=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 120003=Meal plans for those who don't have the patience to cook for themselves, and an excellent selection of restaurants which cater to the college crowd. There are even a few places which are open until 4:30 AM!, 57146=If you can, AVOID 1920 COMMONS. The food is terrible. Youre better off going to Hill or Houston.}",

While Penn is ideal for anyone of this personality complexion, it isn't mandatory. I certainly didn't fit this mold--though I'm slowly being converted--and many of my friends don't either. Nonetheless, do not apply here if you aren't prepared to work hard and pull plenty of all-nighters. Tips for prospective students Visit campus. Penn was bottom of the list for me, barely even a consideration. On my way to spend two days at Duke, I felt obliged to stop and spend half a day at Penn. I won't bore you with the details, but let's just say that I'm sitting in a dorm at Penn right now with no regrets. Bang for the buck",
