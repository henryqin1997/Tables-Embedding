An additional small number of GS-14s are promoted directly into the SES. Where an EEO group has a low participation rate in the feeder grade/applicant pool, there is a strong likelihood that the group will be absent or have a low participation rate in the next higher grade level. See, General Accountability Office Report No.GAO-03-34, Senior Executive Service: Agency Efforts Needed to Improve Diversity as the Senior Corps Turns Over (January 2003)., 138316=6 See Women in State Policy Leadership, 1998-2005: An Analysis of Slow and Uneven Progress, Report issued by the Center for Women in Government and Civil Society, State University of New York At Albany, SUNY (Winter 2006)., 130820=In FY 2005, OFO closed 3,000 appeals addressing the merits of the underlying discrimination claims, and made a total of 145 findings of discrimination or 4.8% of the total. In FY 2004, OFO closed 3,451 appeals addressing the merits of the underlying discrimination claims, and made a total of 226 findings of discrimination or 6.5% of the total. OFO reversed 21.8% of the 3,682 appeals which addressed procedural closures in FY 2005., 113134=Figure 7 - Comparison of Requests for EEOC Hearings to Complaints Filed FY 2001 - FY 2005, 118399=In FY 2005, EEOC Administrative Judges issued 232 decisions finding discrimination which was 5.1% of all decisions on the merits of complaints. In comparison to the 329 decisions finding discrimination that Administrative Judges issued in FY 2004, the 232 decisions in FY 2005 represent a decrease of 29.5%. Agencies may either fully implement or appeal the Administrative Judge's decision to the EEOC's Office of Federal Operations (OFO). In FY 2005, agencies appealed only 1.7% of all Administrative Judge decisions; however, they appealed 30.3% of the cases where an Administrative Judge found discrimination., 80473=During counseling and ADR in the pre-complaint stage, EEO disputes can be resolved by either a settlement or a decision not to file a formal complaint. In FY 2005, the government-wide average was 53.7%, up from 50.7% in FY 2004., 142368=This page was last modified on August 28, 2006., 132588=In FY 2005, the $15.1 million in monetary benefits awarded in compliance with appellate decisions (including settlement agreements resolving appeals) decreased by 31.7% from the $22.1 million awarded in FY 2004, and increased 81.9% from the $8.3 million awarded in FY 2001., 25754=In a report entitled, \"Practical Advice for Drafting and Implementing Reasonable Accommodation Procedures Under Executive Order 13164\" (July 19, 2005), EEOC identified pitfalls discovered in many federal agencies' reasonable accommodation policies and provided best practices for developing procedures that comply with EEOC guidance. To assist agencies in improving the quality of reasonable accommodation policies, EEOC encourages agencies to: (1) require immediate processing of all oral requests, without waiting until the written request is received; (2) provide a range of agency officials who can receive accommodation requests; (3) describe step-by-step how to evaluate and resolve a request; (4) describe how and when to conduct an interactive process; (5) describe what types of medical information or documentation can be sought; (6) require an upper-level review before denying a request based on undue hardship; and (7) describe how and when to obtain review by an agency's own medical expert. \ufffd See \"Policy Guidance on Executive Order 13164: \ufffdEstablishing Procedures to Facilitate the Provision of Reasonable Accommodation\" (October 20, 2000)., 36732=The Federal Wage System was established by Public Law 92-392 in 1972 to standardize pay rates for Blue-Collar federal employees., 139868=10The 180-day period may be extended by 90 days if both parties agree. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.108(e). The regulations also extend the 180-day time limit for consolidated and amended complaints to the earlier of 180 days from the date of the most recent consolidated or amended complaint, or 360 days from the date of the earliest pending complaint. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.108(f)., 141056=16 The EEOC has corrected the data for average processing days of hearings for FY 2001., 112531=Figure 6 - Hearings Inventory FY 2000 - FY 2005, 29286=SEC's policy is to reasonably accommodate qualified persons with disabilities covered by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 when they request accommodations and accommodations will not cause the SEC undue hardship. This document, \"Requesting Accommodations at SEC\" is a comprehensive resource guide for everyone involved in the accommodations process. It explains how persons with disabilities should request accommodations, how requests are processed and how requestors may seek review of decisions denying requests., 128702=Table 26 below, provides a breakdown by appeal type of all FY 2005 receipts and closures., 69331=Agencies process federal employees' EEO complaints under regulations promulgated by EEOC at 29 C.F.R. Part 1614. Employees who are unable to resolve their concerns through counseling can file a complaint with their agency.8 The agency will either dismiss 9 or accept the complaint. If the complaint is accepted, the agency must conduct an investigation, and in most instances, issue the investigative report within 180 days from the date the complaint was filed.10, 106727=Average monetary benefits awarded in resolution of formal EEO complaints increased by 42.5% between FY 2004 and FY 2005 and 36.2% between FY 2001 and FY 2005. Table 21 above shows the total monetary benefits awarded during the formal complaint process for the past five fiscal years, while Figure 5 indicates what portion of these benefits were for compensatory damages, attorneys' fees and lump sum payments., 135701=The requirement to file an EEOC Form 462 Report applies to all federal agencies and departments covered by 29 C.F.R. Part 1614, as defined in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.103(b). This includes Executive agencies as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105, military departments as defined in 5 U.S.C. 102, the Government Printing Office, the Postal Rate Commission, the Smithsonian Institution, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the United States Postal Service, and those units of the judicial branch of the federal government having positions in the competitive service. All covered agencies must file Form 462 Reports with the Commission. Form 462 Reports are due on or before October 31st of each year., 131331=The average processing time for appeal closures fell to 194 days in FY 2005, representing a 6.3% decrease from 207 days in FY 2004, and a 56.6% decrease from 447 days in FY 2001. OFO resolved 3,899 (52.0%) of the 7,490 appeals received in FY 2005, within 180 days. The average age of an open appeal in the inventory at the end of FY 2005 was 198 days, a 15.8% increase from the 171-day average age at the end of FY 2004 and a 55.7% reduction from the 430-day average age of the open inventory at the end of FY 2001., 82439=In FY 2005, the Defense Logistics Agency reported the highest ADR resolution rate in the pre-complaint process (89.6%), whereas the government-wide average was 50.5%. See Table 14. When the U.S. Postal Service resolution rate (49.1%) is excluded from the government-wide average, the government-wide ADR resolution rate increased to 54.9% in FY 2005. Agencies that had fewer than 25 ADR closures were not included in the ranking. Table B-5 in Appendix III contains this information for all agencies., 112849=Hearing requests increased by 13.7% from 9,027 hearing requests in FY 2004 to 10,266 in FY 2005, and have increased by 4.6% from FY 2001. For comparison purposes, the 10,266 hearings requested comprised 57.0% of the total complaints filed in FY 2005., 72612=Table 10 below shows that in FY 2005, the National Endowment for the Arts reported the highest counseling rate (24.2%), while the government-wide average was 1.4%. Agencies that had fewer than 25 completed/ended counselings were not included in the ranking. Table B-1 in Appendix III lists this information for all agencies., 36220=Senior Pay Level pay structures were created by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which established the Senior Executive Service (SES) as a separate personnel system covering a majority of the top managerial, supervisory, and policy-making positions in the Executive Branch of government., 29958=Sections II(A) and (C) of EEOC's MD-715 provide that model EEO programs should \"issue a written policy statement expressing their commitment to . . . a workplace free of discriminatory harassment\" and \"establish procedures to prevent . . . harassment.\" For more information, please review EEOC's Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors, Notice 915.002 (June 18, 1999) (Enforcement Guidance on Harassment)., 131880=Figure 13 - Average Processing Days on Appeal FY 2001 - FY 2005, 139593=9 There are several reasons an agency may dismiss a complaint, including the complainant's failure to state a claim, timely contact a counselor, or failure to provide necessary information to the agency. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a71614.107(a)., 96197=Finally, when an EEOC Administrative Judge has issued a decision, the agency must issue a final order either implementing or not implementing the Administrative Judge's decision and simultaneously appealing to the EEOC. In FY 2005, agencies issued 5,017 final orders implementing and 87 orders not implementing the Administrative Judge's decision. Commission regulations require agencies to issue an order within 40 calendar days of receiving the Administrative Judge's decision. In FY 2005, agencies issued orders in an average of 191 days after receiving the Administrative Judge's decision, which is down from 200 days in FY 2004., 76048=Figure 3 - ADR Usage in the Pre-Complaint Process FY 2004 - FY 2005 13, 55418=Figure 1 - Average Grade in the General Schedule FY 2005, 87576=Of the 18,017 complaints filed in FY 2005, the top basis alleged was reprisal (7,105) and the top issue was non-sexual harassment (4,550). As shown in Tables 16 and 17, this trend has remains unchanged for the past five years., 6038=Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive 715 (MD-715), issued October 1, 2003, established standards for ensuring that agencies develop and maintain model EEO programs. These standards will be used to measure and report on the status of the federal government's efforts to become a model employer. As detailed in MD-715, the six elements of a model EEO program are:, 7466=The FY 2005 Annual Report on the Federal Work Force, addressed to the President and Congress, presents a summary of selected EEO program activities in the federal government, including a work force profile of 59 federal agencies. The report provides valuable information to all agencies as they strive to become model employers., 127038=OFO received 7,490 appeals in FY 2005, representing a 4.4% decrease from the 7,831 appeals filed in FY 2004, and reversing the two-year upward trend from FY 2003 through FY 2004. FY 2005 appeal receipts, however, still represented an 8.6% increase from the 6,894 appeals received in FY 2001., 112208=The hearings inventory decreased from 5,975 in FY 2004 to 5,896 in FY 2005, which represents a decline of 1.3%. Since FY 2001, the hearings inventory has fallen by 49.4% from a high of 11,659 cases. The decrease in hearing requests has contributed to a reduction in the hearings inventory., 127759=OFO closed a total of 7,514 cases in FY 2005, of which 5,831 (77.6%) alleged violations of Title VII; 2,040 (27.1%) appeals involved the Rehabilitation Act; 1,941 (25.8%) appeals alleged violations of the ADEA; and 1 (0.01%) appeal involved the Equal Pay Act of 1963. In FY 2004, OFO closed a total of 8,028 cases, of which 6,224 were Title VII cases (77.5%); 2,046 appeals involved the Rehabilitation Act (25.5%); 2,093 appeals alleged violations of the ADEA (26.1%); and four appeals involved the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (0.1%).20 See Figure 12 for the appeals closures from FY 2001 to FY 2005., 101232=In FY 2005, the Defense Commissary Agency reported the highest percentage (100%) of timely issued merit decisions without an Administrative Judge decision. See Table 20 below.15 Agencies that issued fewer than 25 merit decisions without a hearing were not included in the ranking. See Table B-14 in Appendix III for this information on all agencies located at www.eeoc.gov., 90262=Investigations into allegations of discrimination are a key component of the formal EEO complaint process. Delays may impede the primary goal of gathering sufficient evidence to permit a determination as to whether discrimination occurred. EEOC regulation 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.106(e)(2) requires agencies to conduct an investigation and issue a report to the complainant within 180 days of the filing of a complaint unless: 1) the parties agreed to no more than a 90-day extension (may not exceed 270 days); and 2) the complaint was amended or consolidated, which can add another 180 days to the period but may not exceed 360 days., 4477=(Actual tables are only available on EEOC's Web-site at http://www.eeoc.gov/federal/fsp2005/index.html), 72181=Figure 2 - Counseling to Formal Complaints Filed FY 2001 - FY 2005, 74114=As shown in Table 11 below, in FY 2005 the Department of Education and Broadcasting Board of Governors reported the highest complaint rate (1.7%), while the government-wide average was 0.6%. Agencies that had fewer than 25 complaints filed were not included in the ranking. Table B-1 in Appendix III contains this information for all agencies., 132267=In FY 2004 and FY 2005, reprisal, race (Black) and disability have remained the top three most prevalent bases of discrimination in appeals. For the same period, promotion, harassment (non-sexual) and removal were the top three issues of discrimination in appeals., 122498=In FY 2005, Administrative Judge decisions and settlements at the hearings stage awarded $58.7 million in benefits, exceeding the $45.9 million in FY 2004 and the $44.3 million awarded in FY 2001. This reversed a two-year trend of decreasing monetary benefits at the hearing stage. Note that benefits at the hearings stage are preliminary, pending a decision on implementation by the agency or on appeal., 34736=Now, more than ever before, with the increasing expectations of government institutions, federal agencies must position themselves to attract, develop and retain a top-quality work force in order to ensure our nation's continued growth, security and prosperity. To develop this competitive, highly qualified work force, federal agencies must fully utilize the talents of all employees, regardless of race, color, religion, national origin, sex or disability. In order to assist agencies in attaining these goals, on October 1, 2003, MD-715 became effective and set forth \"policy guidance and standards for establishing and maintaining effective affirmative programs of equal employment opportunity under Section 717 of Title VII and effective affirmative action programs under Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act.\", 68478=EEOC's regulations provide that each agency shall \"assure that individual complaints are fairly and thoroughly investigated and that final action is taken in a timely manner.\" 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.102(c)(5). Section II(E) of MD-715 establishes that a model EEO program must have an efficient and fair dispute resolution process and effective systems for evaluating the impact and effectiveness of their EEO programs. In this regard, Section II(E) recommends that agencies \"benchmark against EEOC regulations at 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 and other federal agencies of similar size which are highly ranked in EEOC's Annual Report on the federal sector complaints process.\", 20835=EEOC's regulations governing agency programs to promote equal employment opportunity require each agency to maintain a continuing affirmative program to promote equal opportunity and to identify and eliminate discriminatory practices and polices. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.102(a). To implement its program, each agency shall designate a Director of Equal Employment Opportunity who shall be under the immediate supervision of the agency head. 29 C.F.R. \u00a71614.102(b)(4)., 7814=To prepare this report, the Commission relied on the following data: 1) work force data obtained from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management's Central Personnel Data File (CPDF); 2) data from the 1990 and 2000 EEO Special Files; 3) EEO complaint processing data submitted and certified as accurate by 94 federal agencies; 4) hearings and appeals data obtained from the EEOC's internal databases; and 5) EEO program data submitted and certified as accurate by 170 of 202 federal agencies and subcomponents in their fiscal year (FY) 2004 MD-715 reports.2, 118020=Figure 8 - Average Processing Days for Hearings FY 2001 - FY 2005, 92315=Federal agencies fail to timely investigate claims of discrimination for many reasons. After reviewing the investigatory practices of selected agencies, EEOC has identified several reasons for untimely investigations: poorly staffed EEO offices, unnecessary and time-consuming procedures,14 delays in obtaining affidavits, and inadequate tracking and monitoring systems. For more information, see EEOC's Federal Sector Investigations - Time and Cost, issued June 2005 and Attaining a Model Agency Program: Efficiency at http://www.eeoc.gov/federal/., 21315=Of the 94 agencies (with 100 or more employees) that submitted a Form 462 report in FY 2005, 66 agencies (70.2%) reported that their EEO Director reports to the agency head., 36522=The General Schedule pay system was created by the Classification Act of 1949, which created a centralized job evaluation for all White-Collar positions and merged several separate schedules into one., 126413=OFO's appellate inventory declined in FY 2005 to 3,610, which represents a 0.7% reduction from the 3,634 case inventory at the close of FY 2004 and a significant reduction of 52.1% from the 7,536 cases in inventory at the close of FY 2001., 100681=* The EEOC did not collect data showing the timely merit Final Agency Decisions until FY 2004., 107171=Figure 5 - Monetary Benefits Awarded in the Formal Complaint Stage FY 2001 - FY 2005, 22169=Of the 170 agencies and subcomponents that submitted an MD-715 report for FY 2004, 75 (44%) indicated that the EEO Director had conducted the briefing., 76468=In FY 2005, the U.S. Postal Service reported the highest ADR participation rate in the pre-complaint process (76.5%), while the government-wide average was 45.4%. See Table 12. Agencies that had fewer than 25 completed/ended counseling were not included in the ranking. See Tables B-1 and B-4 in Appendix III for information on all agencies., 117600=For the second year, the average processing time for hearing closures fell from 355 days in FY 2004 to 249 days in FY 2005, representing a significant decrease from the 343 days in FY 2001.16 The average age of the pending inventory increased to 207 days in FY 2005 from 183 days in FY 2004, but was still significantly lower than the 453 days in FY 2001., 103388=Since FY 2001, the number of findings of discrimination has increased in the federal government. Table 21 below shows that both the total number of merit decisions and the number of findings of discrimination have increased over the past three years. For the first time in five years, over 3% of merit decisions resulted in a finding of discrimination., 127364=Figure 11 - Comparison of Appeals Receipts to Complaint Closures FY 2001 - FY 2005, 136836=2 We have included additional data provided by the U.S. Postal Service, the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, which are not reported in the CPDF. It should be noted that, total work force numbers are not provided by certain agencies for national security reasons. In addition, the CPDF data may not include some employees in non-pay status, such as employees on extended military leave. Neither the 1990 nor 2000 EEO Special File controls for citizenship., 113732=Excluding the class actions, the 10,143 individual cases in FY 2005 were closed in the following manner: 12.5% were by decision following a hearing; 32.3% were by decisions on the record; 25.1% were closed by settlements; 13.2% were by procedural dismissal; and 17.0% were withdrawals. See Table 23 for a comparison of FY 2001 - FY 2005., 122936=Figure 9 - Monetary Benefits Awarded from Hearings (In Millions of Dollars) FY 2001 - FY 2005, 4709=The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commission) was established by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII, with the mission of eradicating discrimination in the workplace. In the federal sector, EEOC enforces Title VII, which prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), which prohibits employment discrimination against individuals 40 years of age and older; the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender in compensation for substantially similar work under similar conditions; and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Rehabilitation Act), which prohibits employment discrimination against federal employees and applicants with disabilities and requires that reasonable accommodations be provided., 84478=The monetary benefits awarded in settlements during the pre-complaint phase, shown in Table 15, have dropped significantly since FY 2001. The data showed a decrease in the average amount of monetary benefits from $5,203 in FY 2004 to $2,912 in FY 2005., 71044=Instances of counseling decreased by 3.2% from FY 2004 to FY 2005 and decreased 13.8% from FY 2001. Formal complaints declined by 5.3% in FY 2005 and 22.7% from FY 2001. Of the 41,070 instances of counseling, 16,495 individuals filed 18,017 formal complaints in FY 2005.12 The number of formal complaints filed represents 43.9% of all pre-complaint counseling activities in FY 2005. As Figure 2 shows, over the past five fiscal years, the number of pre-complaint counseling activities has fluctuated between a high of 56,275 in FY 2002 and a low of 41,070 in FY 2005, while the number of complaints filed by individuals has steadily decreased. During the same five-year period, the number of formal complaints filed continued to represent less than 50% of all pre-complaint counseling activities. See Figure 2. Significantly, we note that while the United States Postal Service constituted 28.9% of the work force, it accounted for over 38% of all EEO counselings, complaints filed, completed investigations and complaints closed in FY 2005. See Table B-1 in Appendix III., 23288=Of the 94 agencies with 100 or more employees that filed an EEOC Form 462 report in FY 2005, 84% ensured their EEO staff received the required regulatory training. Agencies trained 1,840 new EEO counselors and 351 new EEO investigators. Agencies also provided the required 8-hour annual refresher training to 3,713 EEO counselors and 1,473 EEO investigators. Additionally, agencies reported providing 32-hour training to 74 EEO counselor/investigators and 8-hour training to 144 EEO counselor/investigators. Through the EEOC Training Institute, 25 agencies provided additional MD-715 training for their EEO staff., 28132=The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, requires federal agencies to reasonably accommodate qualified individuals with covered disabilities. Reasonable accommodations do not include accommodations that would cause undue hardship to the employer. Individuals have covered disabilities if they have long term physical or mental conditions that substantially impair their ability to perform major life activities (such as seeing, hearing, walking and speaking). Individuals are not disabled if their long term conditions do not substantially impair their ability to perform major life activities when they are compared to most other people in the general population. Individuals are not disabled if their condition is likely to last less than three months regardless of how severely it impacts their ability to perform major life activities. Individuals are qualified when they meet the education, experience and licensing requirements of the position and can perform the essential functions of the position with--or without--reasonable accommodations., 95552=An agency may also issue a decision after an investigation, either finding discrimination or finding no discrimination. In FY 2005, agencies timely issued 59.1% of their final agency merit decisions, an increase from the 43.6% timely completed in FY 2004. Commission regulations require agencies to issue final decisions within 60 days of complainant's request for such a decision or within 90 days after completion of an investigation if complainant has not requested either a final decision or an EEOC hearing. In FY 2005, the agencies' average processing time for issuing final decisions was 191 days, down from 200 days in FY 2004., 133335=In FY 2005, EEOC staff members reached a record number of federal employees, informing them of their rights and responsibilities under the EEO process, affirmative employment programs and laws which the Commission enforces. The EEOC's proactive prevention activities targeted multiple agencies which provided their managers and supervisors the opportunity to understand how to prevent employment discrimination within their workplace. These training sessions were provided by staff members from the Office of Federal Operations and various EEOC district offices throughout the country., 80004=On average, in FY 2005 agencies meet timeliness requirements for EEO counseling in 80.7% of all completed/ended counselings which is up from 76.3% in FY 2004 and 77.42% in FY 2001. Agencies are required to complete counseling in 30 days except when there is a 60-day extension due to an ADR election or the complainant agrees in writing to an extension., 6781=This report covers the period from October 1, 2004, through September 30, 2005 and contains selected measures of agencies' progress toward model EEO programs.1 While working within our mission as an oversight agency, the EEOC strives to create a partnership with agencies. During the cited period, the EEOC sought and received assessment input from EEO Directors through several EEOC-sponsored feedback sessions. The information that we received has been invaluable as we work to achieve excellence in program planning and evaluation. The EEOC plans to continue dialogue with EEO Directors as we work to address the concerns of federal agencies., 30443=In a report entitled, \"Model EEO Programs Must Have an Effective Anti-Harassment Program,\" (October 18, 2005), EEOC found that many federal agencies have a deficient anti-harassment policy. \ufffdOf the 43 agencies that participated in the survey, 7% did not have an anti-harassment policy. \ufffdMore than half (51%) of the agencies' policies did not cover non-sexual bases, and 44% had unclear investigation procedures. \ufffdBy referring to EEOC's Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment By Supervisors, Notice 915.002 (June 18, 1999), the report also encourages agencies to issue an anti-harassment policy that (1) covers all forms of harassment, (2) establishes a prompt, thorough, and impartial investigation process, (3) requires immediate and appropriate corrective action, (4) provides periodic anti-harassment training to all managers and employees; (5) protects complainants and witnesses from retaliation; and (6) protects the confidentiality of individuals who bring claims of harassment., 126687=Figure 10 - Appellate Inventory FY 2001 - FY 2005, 33372=The Department has determined that the most effective way to limit harassing conduct is to treat it as misconduct, even if it does not rise to the level of harassment actionable under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended. A hostile environment claim under Title VII usually requires showing a pattern of offensive conduct. The Department will not wait for such a pattern to emerge. Rather, the Department will act before the harassing conduct is so pervasive and offensive as to constitute a hostile environment. . . . ., 90904=In FY 2005, agencies were timely in completing investigations 54.9% of the time, up from 42.7% in FY 2004 (including written agreements to extend the investigation and consolidated or amended complaints). When the U.S. Postal Service is not included, the percentage of timely completed investigations decreased to 49.7% government-wide. Agencies reported the best investigation time in five years by averaging 237 days to complete an investigation in FY 2005. In comparison, agency investigations averaged 280 days in FY 2004 and 240 days in FY 2001. See Figure 4 below., 75600=In FY 2005, ADR was used in 45.4% of all instances of EEO counseling, which represents an increase of 2.1 percentage points from the ADR participation rate (43.3 percent) in FY 2004 and a 22.7% increase from FY 2002. See Figure 3. Although the ADR offer rate decreased to 76.0% in FY 2005 from 79.5% in FY 2004, the increase in the participation rate indicates more employees are opting to utilize the ADR process., 17463=Reaffirmation of EEO Policy Statement October 4, 2005, 134283=EEOC staff members also responded to more than 7,605 calls regarding the EEO complaint/appeals process, providing the federal sector EEO community and employees with timely information. Additionally, in FY 2005 EEOC staff members provided 109 in-person visits and 30 telephonic technical assistance sessions for affirmative employment programs., 17109=Of the 170 agencies and subcomponents that submitted an MD-715 report for FY 2004, 91 (54%) indicated that they had issued an EEO policy statement and would continue to do so., 107628=As demonstrated by the table below, in FY 2005 over 78% of final agency decisions (FADs), excluding those in which an AJ issued a decision, were affirmed on appeal in FY 2005. Although the percentage has declined slightly from FY 2004, the five-year trend has shown nearly a 5% increase of affirmed FADs since FY 2001., 135415=EEOC regulation 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.602(a) requires agencies to report to the EEOC information concerning pre-complaint counseling, ADR, and the status, processing, and disposition of complaints under this part at such times and in such manner as the Commission prescribes., 25355=To date, EEOC has received 120 reasonable accommodation procedures from agencies and subcomponents and provided feedback to all of those agencies. The EEOC also received 84 resubmissions and provided feedback to all but two agencies. Of the 94 agencies with 100 or more employees that submitted a Form 462 report in FY 2005, 84 (95.4%) provided reasonable accommodation procedures to EEOC., 38458=In FY 2005, the federal government had a Total Work Force of 2,610,920 employees, compared to 2,532,507 in FY 1996.3 Table 2 shows the participation rate of the identified groups below, as compared to the civilian labor force (CLF). Table A-1 in Appendix III provides ten-year trend data., 80802=In FY 2005, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission reported the highest pre-complaint resolution rate (98.9%). See Table 13. Agencies that had fewer than 25 completed/ended counselings were not included in the ranking. Table B-3 in Appendix III contains this information for all agencies., 91508=Figure 4 - Average Processing Days For Investigations for FY 2001 - FY 2005, 132896=Figure 14 - Monetary Benefits Awarded from Appeals21 FY 2001 - FY 2005 (In Millions of Dollars)}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Today, alternative pay plans are being used and proposed across the government. In this report they are identified as \"Other Pay Systems.\" Some of these systems include pay-banding systems, the Market-Based Pay system of the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, and include such agencies as the United States Postal Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority. Table 1 below shows the representation rates for each of these pay structures. The Federal Wage System was established by Public Law 92-392 in 1972 to standardize pay rates for Blue-Collar federal employees. The General Schedule pay system was created by the Classification Act of 1949, which created a centralized job evaluation for all White-Collar positions and merged several separate schedules into one. Senior Pay Level pay structures were created by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which established the Senior Executive Service (SES) as a separate personnel system covering a majority of the top managerial, supervisory, and policy-making positions in the Executive Branch of government. With the increasing number of new grade and pay systems being adopted throughout the federal government, this year's report provides the composition of the Total Work Force as well as that of employees in four pay structures: 1.\u00a0\u00a0Composition of the Federal Work Force As part of the affirmative employment program, agencies must conduct a self-assessment of their work force on at least an annual basis to monitor progress, identify areas where certain groups may be excluded and develop a strategic plan to ensure free and open",
