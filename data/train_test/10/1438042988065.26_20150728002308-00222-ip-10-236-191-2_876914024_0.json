The week-long holidays on May (Labor) Day and National Day began in 2000, as a measure to increase and encourage holiday spending.

In 2008, the Labor Day holiday was shortened to one day to reduce travel rushes to just twice a year, and instead three traditional Chinese holidays were added., 35805=Some Chinese young adults have begun to celebrate 11 November as Singles Day (Chinese: \u5149\u68cd\u8282; pinyin: gu\u0101ng g\u00f9n ji\u00e9) because of the many ones (1s) in the date.[11]}",
