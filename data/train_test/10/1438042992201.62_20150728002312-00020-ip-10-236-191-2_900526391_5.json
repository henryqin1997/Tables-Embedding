    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Grinnellians are hardworking, dedicated, and balanced students. Grinnellians must be hardworking to complete and understand their subjects of study. Grinnellians must be dedicated to their work by going to their professors or peers for help if and when they need it. However, Grinnellians must also be balanced: they must know how to have a successful academic and social life. Grinnell College aims to build strong leaders: the qualities aforementioned are key to building such leadership. If you are looking for a strong education and are willing to push yourself for it, while building close, lasting friendships, Grinnell College is the college for you. Tips for prospective students I would highly recommend prospective students to visit Grinnell before deciding to enroll. Though I fell in love with Grinnell during a college fair, I visited the college three times - twice before applying and once after being accepted. The visit that solidified my decision was when I spent the weekend with a student. This visit helped me to experience the Grinnell life and I knew that I would be a good fit for it. However, Grinnell is not for all people: some people may not be comfortable with the small size of the college, for example. So I recommend researching the college as much as possible before enrolling: visit the college, talk with current or former",
