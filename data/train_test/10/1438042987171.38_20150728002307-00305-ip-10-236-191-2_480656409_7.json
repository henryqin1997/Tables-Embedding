Obviously, modifications and alterations will occur to others upon the reading and understanding of this specification. It is intended to include all such modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalence thereof. While the embodiments disclosed herein illustrate the use of a slot, i.e., a transverse groove or opening, it should be appreciated that other types of openings could be provided along the bottom face of the cooperating member, track or divider assembly disclosed herein. Thus, any type of suitable aperture, way, path, channel, passage or other suitable gap could be employed. For example, a set of notches could be provided along the bottom face instead of a single slot if the mounting member or rail were suitably configured. Thus, the term \u201cslot\u201d as used herein is intended to include all such openings, apertures, holes, orifices, passages, grooves, troughs, channels, indentations and the like. In the various embodiments disclosed herein, the contact surface located on the divider member or track or member which cooperates with the mounting member or front rail is disclosed as being located in the slot. However, it should be appreciated that the contact surface, which can be a set of teeth, can also be located near the slot, adjoining the slot, in proximity to the slot, in the vicinity of",
