            "Chico has these tall blue 911 calling booths that you can't miss. They also have cop cars patrolling the campus at night especially on the weekends. In the beginning of the year they give yo the important numbers needed for emergencies and gave us girls a course on drinking and protecting ourselves. They also send out public notices to your school email if there is anything suspicious or a death on campus.",
            "I just rushed this last semester and it was a great decision! You meet so many people so if you are looking for more things to do and want to meet more people I would recommend checking out the greek life.",
            "There's so many activities and clubs on campus. The first few weeks of school you'll see most of them by the library promoting themselves. CAVE was an amazing experience and if you complete enough hours you can earn an extra unit. Definitely get involved in some!",
            "Chico state is good for people who want the entire college experience. It's accepted and encouraged that we have a social life but a lot of the students I have met also know why we are there. So those students who love to have a good time but can also manage their time well will really enjoy their time here.",
            "I think you definitely get your bang for the buck here. Not only do we have a good mix of a social and academic life, we also have a great small town that is always available to help the school. We have great academics and professors that actually push you to be better than you were instead of getting you to merely pass the class. I couldn't imagine myself anywhere else.",
            "Believe it or not there are other fun things to do here besides party. But the party scene is really fun and what most people do on the weekends. If that isn't for you there are other activities and events you can be apart of. The school likes to put on events like movie nights, DIY crafts, and fair type activities. There's also the farmers market where you can get great food and free samples and the Senator theater downtown that normally hosts concerts and events. And you can't forget to check out Bidwell park which has really cool hiking spots like Monkey face. Then a popular thing to do when it's hot is to swim or tan at one mile. If you have a car you can drive to the mall or movie theater also which isn't too far from you.",
            "The food here is either a hit or miss. Cereal and bagels will become your best friend. Sutter dining tries to experiment a lot and sometimes it's good, but other times you're trying to decide what looks most edible. The dining hall closes at 7 so if you have a night class I would suggest Sutter Cafe which is right next to it. But be warned that the line normally is out the door and you have to wait about 30 min. The food is better quality though and I ended up eating here most of 2nd semester. The marketplace takes flex cash and I would suggest getting the meal plan with most flex cash. It was my favorite place to eat! Pretty much everything is good there.",
            "I had an amazing dorm experience! Most people say that you shouldn't expect to be best friends with your roommate, which you shouldn't because every situation is different, but I was one of the lucky people. My roommate and I did everything together and we have become best friends because of it. You really just have to have an open mind about your living situation and be open to compromise. You have to understand that you aren't living alone but sharing a small room with another person and their lifestyle. I also had a great group of girls on the hall. I lived in Shasta and it was the best decision. Whitney Hall is a very social dorm but tends to be loud a lot of the time. Shasta was quiet when needed like sleeping hours or for finals week, but also didn't lack that party scene if you're looking for that.",
            "I've experienced both types of rigor. The really easy classes where you pretty much just have to show up and participate, and the other classes where you have a 3 question quiz on an entire 210 page book. Either way I actually have learned a lot in all of my classes. Try and get into a smaller class because it may not seem like a big deal, but having the option of getting help from your professor can really save you.",
            "-Have an open mind! When I first applied to Chico I was nervous that I had picked a school focused only on partying. My mind changed at summer orientation when I saw all of the clubs and opportunities Chico actually gave you. -If you have a meal plan try and organize how many meals a week you should be having. Because both semesters I had so many meals left over and the last week I tried to eat around 5 times a day! -Be prepared for both extreme heat from August to early October, and extreme cold in the winter. And when I say extreme I mean extreme for someone from the Bay Area. (100degrees and 30degrees)",
            "Chico State is everything I imagined and more. Not only have I met the friendliest and most outgoing people here, but this small college town resembles everything you would want throughout your years in college. Chico State has great academics, clubs, social life and a community filled with school spirit."

(100degrees and 30degrees), 217698=Okay, I'm going to divide the food and dining into two categories-the dining hall on campus and dining out in town. The Sutter Dining Hall was only recently opened in 2011, so it's extremely new and modern. However, the food options aren't necessarily the greatest. But I guarantee if you ask anyone at any school, they'll all tell you that they're dining hall stinks. Now as for downtown dining, it's awesome. There's a great pizza place called Celestino's (it's been a huge staple while I've lived in Chico), and also a burger/bar joint called The Bear (you have to try the jiffy burger...yes, it's a burger with peanut butter on it!), 584889=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here I have only met the best people and friends at Chico. It is easy to get into that party scene, but with the challenging academics, focusing on school is just as easy and way more important. Everyone always says people only go to Chico State for the partying, but I always say that im there to get one of the best buiness degrees in the state of CA. Am learning a lot As a business student at Chico State, it is very competetive and i feel that the teachers are there not only to teach you the information required, but also give you real hands on experience with the subject matter.
