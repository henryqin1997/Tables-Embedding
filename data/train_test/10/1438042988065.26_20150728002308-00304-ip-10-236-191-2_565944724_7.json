Pit: Leaving victory up to luck doesn't seem like the best strategy. Viridi: Getting hit with a nine will knock out any fighter with a single strike, no matter who it is. When his back is against the wall, Mr. Game & Watch might try his luck with a Judge attack. Palutena: Mr. Game & Watch's Judge attack displays random numbers. And when it displays \"9,\" the attack is devastating. Pit: Uh, what are you talking about? Viridi: Watch out for number nine. Pit. Palutena: No, that's just Mr. Game & Watch. Pit: Hey, it's a Shadow Bug! Palutena's Guidance[edit] The Game & Watch title Octopus featured a hero collecting treasure while avoiding a bothersome giant octopus's tentacles. Activate Mr. Game & Watch's Final Smash to transform into that octopus! Ram into opponents, and use the attack button to extend the tentacles. The only thing you can't do is change the direction you're facing. Octopus Description Image Name Red indicates exclusive to the Nintendo 3DS version. Blue indicates exclusive to the Wii U version.",

Melee whose All-Star trophy does not display him in an alternate coloration. Additionally, that trophy isn't affected by the background lighting, which is shown with most trophies. When turned into metal by a Metal Box, Mr. Game & Watch will still make beeping noises when attacking, moving around, or taking damage. This is likely because he has no voice effects. He also appears more 3-D when metal. In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, however, Mr. Game & Watch will make clanking noises while moving in metal form. While Mr. Game & Watch keeps his silver outline in his Metal form in Super Smash Bros. Melee, his outline becomes black in Metal form in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Mr. Game & Watch is one of only two fighters who isn't actually a specific video game character. The other is R.O.B, who isn't even a video game",
