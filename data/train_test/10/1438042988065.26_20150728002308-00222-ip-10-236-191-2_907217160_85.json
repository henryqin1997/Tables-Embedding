    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{53228=Great! The monthly tuition for a full time student (12-18 credits) is only $1466. At Utah Valley University it was $2380. Almost all the professors are Adjunct Professors meaning they get no benefits and less pay. So the professors are all there because they love to teach and work with students., 4913=My tips would be to develop good study habits (classes such as LE 1020 are good to take for college freshmen and everyone else), learn of the various resources on campus, start school with a good attitude, and set goals and achieve them., 784701=Salt Lake Community College had a food court in every campus. There's a grill, cafe, pizzeria, deli, and a coffee shop provided to students. I personally have not tried most of the food within the food court in SLCC but I have tried the cajun fries at the Champions Grill and it was absolutely amazing. It seems to always be filled with students so i'm guessing the food at the Bruin food court is absolutely amazing., 541628=If you are going to apply for financial aide, do it fast! Sign up for classes at 12:01 am of the day you can sign up. Work hard and do your best!, 13590=The best part of SLCC is the low cost of tuition. Currently tuition for 12-18 credits is about $1,400. Compared to the University of Utah for example, that's about $1000-$1900 difference! Students can get a great 2-year education relatively cheap and either transfer to a 4-year college or stop at graduation. Either way they save money!, 685858=SLCC is definitely worth your time & money. A full time student will pay about 1700 dollars, pre books, for a semester. It's a great deal compared to other colleges!, 540156=It's Utah! You can ski, snowboard, water-ski, hike, swim, snow-shoe, rock climb, bike, run, see a REAL game, the Jazz, tour the 2002 Olympic sites..., 756582=The tuition for a semester was about $1300 depending on how many classes you take. This price was for 12 semester hours., 216329=Classes are usually pretty cheap. To take 12 credit hours worth of classes is only about 1500 dollars. Books are a bit expensive, but you can buy them used, and then sell them online. Also, students at SLCC have an option to purchase a discounted pass to ride the trax train which goes across the valley, making for an easy method of transportation., 790741=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 31840=During high school I took Math 2210/Multivariate Calculus and Math 2250/Differential Equations and Linear Algebra from SLCC during release time. The classes were excellent. They were at least as rigorous as the equivalent courses at other Utah schools and probably more so, since they met 5 hours a week even though they were only articulated as 3 and 4 credit classes. Dr. Ronald McKay isn't the best math teacher, but he's extremely friendly and very good at explaining things in simple, understandable terms. You can go to Dr. McKay for anything, and he knows you personally and inquires after you as a friend. Dr. Costello isn't as friendly and is prone to long, irrelevant tangents, but he's a math teacher par excellence. Dr. Costello proves and derives EVERYTHING, so you learn the fundamentals from him and thus understand the material more than you would otherwise., 765151=Very cheap college a full time semester (12 credits) cost me $1700, 311486=Average cost for 12 credits is 1500 dollars. They give you a reasonable price for the credits you receive., 454099=Intro classes are not bad. As you move up though into the 2000 level classes, difficulty level does rise., 464954=Depending on your major, you may have to take courses that are a bit rigorous. For example English 2010 was pretty intense, as well as any college level physics course. Other than that if you study hard enough you'll do just fine at Salt Lake Community College.}",

Bang for the buck Colleges are expensive, and Salt Lake Community College is no exception. Tuition is getting higher every year. And with the textbook and student fees, it would almost seem like students would have to pay a million dollars every semester. However, there are many scholarships out there about which few students know. Fastweb is a search engine that collects scholarship information specifically for a student and gives him/her the link to apply for the scholarship. Salt Lake Community College gives scholarships specifically for its students. The financial aid office, located on the second floor of the student center, is a good place to inquire about scholarship information, including FAFSA. Am enjoying being here There are so many resources, especially in the Taylorsville Redwood campus, for students just starting out. Each building has something that can somehow help students. The student center is the main building, and it has everything for every student. There are volunteer opportunities that students can",
