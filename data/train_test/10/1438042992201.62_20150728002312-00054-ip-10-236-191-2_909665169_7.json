            "What amazed me most about my new college is the welcoming atmosphere. The staff and students were so nice and full of energy and the unity between everyone on campus is great.

The student to teacher ratio is 9:1, so the professors really get to know you on a first name basis. It is a private school, so it is more expensive than others, but classes are pretty much guaranteed, and it is worth it in the long run because of the one-on-one experience and the ability to graduate on time., 74611=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 58907=We were able to have the opportunity to have a anchor transferred from out of the pacific ocean into our school weighing 10,000 pounds.

    "textAfterTable": "In three sentences Marymount College is ideal for those who don't want to get lost in the University/Larger Colleges. I have found that the smaller classrooms allow me to feel more comfortable in seeking further help from my teachers. Their study hall, as been a wonderful place for me to do my homework and research paper's I need to write. Being a new student, I am often not sure of many things, I have made many trips to the Administration Office and everybody I have come in contact with has been kind and helpful. This school really does make you feel like you matter and that you are important. I am enjoying everyday at my new school, I like my roommates and team mates. This school has everything I was seeking for college! Login to rate or flag the reviews Alexandra from Torrance, CA 06/25/2012 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.
