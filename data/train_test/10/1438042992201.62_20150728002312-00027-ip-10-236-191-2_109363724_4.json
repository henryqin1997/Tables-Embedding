He has extensive experience utilizing novel surgical methods to maximize tumor removal and minimize surgical complications. He is an expert on the use of preoperative planning and imaging to remove tumors from eloquent areas of the brain. He routinely performs awake craniotomy with intraoperative cortical mapping to avoid motor or speech injury during removal of tumors near these areas of the brain. He has instituted an intraoperative MRI program, the only one available in the Intermountain West. He also co-directs the Stereotactic Radiosurgery program which utilizes the Brain Lab Novalis Frameless Shaped Beam System for precise delivery of radiation for treatment of benign and malignant brain tumors. He and Dr Dennis Shrieve have treated over 1000 patients using these techniques., 69504=Copyright \u00a9 2015 University of Utah Health Care}",
