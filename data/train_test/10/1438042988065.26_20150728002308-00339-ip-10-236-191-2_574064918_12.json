            "Topic: How much of a stalker are you? Now this is a less serious thread about stalking as you can probably tell by the poll options. Unlike other threads about stalking this is about you being the stalker, not the prey. Here you can say how much of a stalker you've been. You looked things up online, maybe even did a full background check. You secretly took pictures of someone just to admire them. Followed someone, maybe found out their schedule by watching so much. Constantly checked someone social page Ex. Myspace, Facebook, Twitter etc. ( I really hope no one says what's Myspace). Even something as small as you suggested something in the I'm looking for section of MU, and you keep checking to see if that person added it to their complete list or favorite list (If they make their lists public that is). My stalker tendencies ... Well I picked I'm only a cyber stalker. Yeah I'll check if someone got arrested. What? It's public record I can check if I wanted to ... and I do >.< . Occasional Facebook stalking, and MU stalking ... Yes, I do sometimes see what posts you've made, or what you've read/reading. I'm not that bad of a stalker I swear ... I'm going to stop talking about myself now. I feel like I've said too much *Note I do not support actual stalkers (and everyone else that may post probably doesn't either) so please don't take this thread offensively if you've been stalked in real life. I even stated at the beginning that this is a less serious thread. If you want to make a comment on what you would do if you were stalked there's this thread If you were being stalked. If you wanted to talk about how you had a stalker there's this thread here Tales of Creepy Stalkers, Rejection and Harassment + Bus Stories The above links are you as a victim. Any comments below should be about you being the stalker. ________________ Yes yes, I know I make longwinded comments, but that's just me >.< I should proof read my comments more, but I won't...

            "Yay! I'm not alone anymore. xD It's honestly not my fault I'm such a stalker.. u.u'' I mean, out of boredom I searched a friend (just first and last name, no middle or confirmation name or anything else. It's not a rare name either..) and they're like, the first 5 results or something. ._.'' Granted, I suppose being able to tell they first several results were them without clicking the links is a bit of a feat which may require the talents of a stalker. >.<; Oh well.. Technically I'm only a cyber stalker with occasional leering outside my window at people (it's only people watching! I actually used to do it out on my porch but I picked up only peering outside my window after a few long winters).. But to be quite frank through cyber stalking I'm pretty sure I've come across information about people (friends, colleagues, etc) that I wouldn't know if I stalked them irl short of breaking into their place and reading all their information and a personal diary if they had one. ._.'' I blame people's tendencies to go with what's familiar and comfortable. Search for members by their email and you stumble upon what's supposed to be a secret account to rant and rave about the problems in their life. Happen across a similar username and they go and fill out a very specific location and their interests so they can be identified by anyone who knows them.. And then sites making you sign up using Facebook or some such, so if you do the same you get recommendations for friends because people don't bother to go into the privacy settings each time they sign up some where to make sure they stay hidden.. *Sighs..* Sorry, rant out of the way. just bothers me whenever people do such things and then are offended that someone read their publicly published thoughts and information. ________________ Earn Gift Cards for Wii, PSN, XBL, LoL, and more.

            "Depends. If it's just any person I've met, then not at all. People I don't know well are of no concern to me. Now, if it's someone who wants to date me, or one of my friends, or if they do/say anything to hurt my friends, I become a super stalker. I like to make sure of who I'm dealing with, and will even befriend their friends and family who don't know me to get info out of them. \"Accidentally\" befriend them of course. I don't necessarily do anything with that information, but I like to have it nonetheless. ________________ If you have to raise your voice to improve your argument, it merely shows how weak the ground you stand on is.",

I'm NOT a stalker! *Looks around to see if my prey heard me* I'm just kidding. Actually I know you didn't pick that .. Well assuming you voted when you made your post. Maybe you pick - I know everything about my prey err I mean \"friend\" *Hides extremely detailed notes under the bed*. See this is a time I wish I had a mustache and beard so I can run my thumb and index finger down them going hmmmmmm. But on a more serious note Unrequited Love sucks. Hang in there things will work out one way or another, and if a slight bit a stalking helps. I think everyone does that to an extent.

            "There's this guy I met one rainy afternoon in our school's cafeteria, I met him again on the library and I pretend to read books while staring at him. Well I had a crush on him since then. I didn't know his name or his major, so I went to our College's fan page and search for DP's who look likes him. It took me a while to find his FB profile. Then I add him, luckily he added me back after 1 week. In his Fb he has his phone number posted and I send him messages claiming I am someone who had a crush on him. I know this is crazy but he think that I was one of his friends making a prank on him. But I insisted that I am a mere stalker. We only had few unserious exchange of thoughts through phone and I often see him walks in front of me. My friends knows that I did some sort of stalking on him and we just laugh out of it.Then I got bored and I stopped bothering him. Last edited by wrensei at 5:13 pm, Nov 15",

            "Cyber stalker all the way. But not on social sites like Facebook, I tend to avoid those. But sites such as Tumblr, I do. Only because when I'm interested in befriending someone I want to get a clear picture of who they are as person before hand, so it doesn't feel like we're total strangers. It's very uncomfortable, especially with social anxiety. Sometimes, I just admire them from afar and never even contact them. ________________ Beavis: \"Wait, what's pornography?\" Butt-head: \"Uhh..

            "I'm only a cyber stalker. But if it is on Facebook, I'm not interested in stalking other people. I like to know what is happening, but I don't really stalk anyone so when they are telling me something later, I'm all \"I already know that\". For Facebook, the cycle is: Finds interesting person (probably a friend of a friend) > see posts, if they are interesting > see bands, books, blogs etc any good stuff that is new for me > if I actually like the person and if he knows someone who is my friend, I ask that friend about that person (I don't stalk people I don't know). The cycle goes like this on MU: Finds interesting person (probably in the forum) > stalks a bit of her forum posts > steals recommendations > if I really like it, maybe bookmark for later, so I can go through her lists. But really, I normally don't even bother doing any of this. Right now is more like someone sends me a profile so I can check how the person is and on MU I have only bookmarked one person (because her taste in manga fits mine so well). ________________ :: myanimelist :: <3 ::"
