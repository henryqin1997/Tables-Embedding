    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6073=As shown in FIG. 1, this invention relates to a system for vacuum packaging or vacuum sealing containers. The basic components of the system are a vacuum sealing appliance 1, an adaptor 901, and canister lids implementing a canister lid valve assembly 1001. As shown in FIG. 2 b, the vacuum sealing appliance 1 contains a vacuum source 15 and a control system 17 for the system implementing a pump 301 and a pressure sensor 501. As shown in FIG. 1, the vacuum sealing appliance 1 uses the vacuum source 15 to extract air from plastic bags and the adaptor 901 uses the vacuum source 15 to extract air from separate rigid containers such as mason jars or canisters using a canister lid valve assembly 1001.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{91438=The piston ring 1008 mounted on one end of the rubber piston 1010 create a piston assembly 1013, which is mounted to move upwardly and downwardly based on relative air pressure above and below the canister lid valve assembly 1001. When the piston assembly 1013 moves upwardly, the vacuum source 15 can draw air from the interior of the canister 1038. Once sufficient air is drawn from the interior, the piston assembly 1038 moves downwards to seal the interior from ambient air and effectively seal the evacuated interior. To allow ambient air back into the interior of the canister 1038, the knob 1002 may be turned, which in turn rotates the piston assembly 1013 to vent air from the canister 1038., 91117=The canister lid valve assembly 1001 generally includes a knob 1002, a plate spring 1004, a piston pipe 1006, a piston ring 1008, and a rubber piston 1010. These components are positioned within an opening defined in the canister lid 1012., 33995=Typically, these appliances operate by receiving a bag, isolating the interior of the bag from ambient air, and drawing air from the interior of the bag before sealing it. One such appliance is a \u201cSeal-A-Meal\u201d product marketed by the Rival Company since at least 1982. This device utilized a simple nozzle to evacuate air from bags, while a single sealing door operated in conjunction with a heat-sealer to seal the bag closed. Other appliances have also been available to evacuate rigid containers such as jars., 94103=The piston assembly 1013 is designed to obstruct and seal the central recess passageways 1027 when the central recess passageways 1027 are not rotatably aligned with the rubber piston passageways 1014. The piston assembly 1013 and central recess 1026 are also designed to allow the piston assembly 1013 to move upwardly and downwardly a distance 1031 within the central recess 1026 depending on whether a vacuum is present. The distance 1031 is sufficient enough to sustain an air flow from the interior of the canister through the central recess passageway 1027., 94776=To prevent the piston assembly 1013 from exiting the central recess 1026 when a vacuum force is applied to the piston assembly 1013, the piston pipe 1006 is inserted into the central recess 1026 over the piston assembly 1013. The piston pipe 1006 frictionally embraces the walls of the central recess 1026 so that the piston pipe 1006 is generally fixed. It may also be affixed with an adhesive compound., 32871=The present patent document is a continuation-in-part of Application Ser. No. 10/371,610 filed on Feb. 21, 2003, which claims the benefit of Provisional U.S. Application Ser. No. 60/416,036, filed on Oct. 4, 2002. The foregoing applications are hereby incorporated by reference., 92624=The piston ring 1008 is preferably disk-shaped, having an annular lip 1019 extending downwardly to embrace the rubber piston 1010. As with the rubber piston 1010, the piston ring 1008 defines matching passageways 1020 large enough to sustain air flow between a lower side 1022 of the piston ring 1008 and an upper side 1024 of the piston ring 1008. The piston ring passageways 1020 are spaced to align with the rubber piston passageways 1014. During assembly, the rubber piston 1010 is inserted into the piston ring 1008 with their respective passageways aligned so that air can flow between the top of the piston ring 1024 and the lower side of the rubber piston 1016., 99308=After sufficient air exits the canister 1038, the air pressure between the upper portion 1028 of the lid 1012 and the lower portion 1030 of the lid 1012 equalizes, causing the piston assembly 1013 to descend to its original position. The vacuum source 15 can then be removed causing ambient air to surround the piston assembly 1013, forcing the piston assembly 1013 securely against the central recess passageways 1027 to seal the central recess passageway 1027 and the interior of the canister 1038 from ambient air., 95943=Due to the communication between the knob 1002 and the piston assembly 1013, when the knob 1002 is rotated the entire piston assembly 1013 rotates. This movement changes whether the rubber piston passageways 1014 are aligned with the central recess passageways 1027, thereby changing whether air can flow between the upper portion 1028 of the lid 1012 and the lower portion 1030 of the lid 1012, or whether the piston assembly 1013 effectively forms a seal over the central recess 1026 due to the rubber piston passageways 1014 being offset from the central recess passageways 1027., 95276=The knob 1002 may be positioned over the pipe 1006, and consists of a circular disk 1033 attached to a set of downwardly extending fingers 1032. The fingers 1032 pass through a hollow area in the center of the piston pipe 1006 and rotationally engage the piston ring 1008. Each finger 1032 defines at least one slot 1034 with a size corresponding to a tab 1036 extending upwards from the piston ring 1008. Each finger 1032 captures at least one tab 1036 so that the knob 1002 and piston assembly 1013 are in direct communication., 98650=The force of the vacuum within the central recess 1026 pulls the piston assembly 1013 upwards allowing the vacuum source 15 to draw air from the interior of the canister 1038. More specifically, when a vacuum exists within the central recess 1026, the piston assembly 1013 lifts upwardly due to the air pressure within the canister 1038. Due to the upward position of the piston assembly 1013, the central recess passageways 1027 are no longer obstructed, allowing the vacuum source 15 to be in communication with the interior of the canister 1038., 97941=During operation, the lid 1012 is placed on a canister 1038 filled with appropriate material. A rubber gasket between the lid 1012 and the canister 1038 forms an airtight seal between the canister 1038 and the lid 1012 containing the canister lid valve assembly 1001 so that the only source of ambient air is the top of the lid 1012. A vacuum source is applied to the upper portion of the lid 1028 creating a vacuum within the central recess 1026. In one embodiment, the vacuum source 15 is applied using the adaptor 901 previously described, but other vacuum sources or adaptors may be used., 92255=The rubber piston 1010 is preferably cylindrical with at least one, preferably two passageways 1014 extending longitudinally along the length of the rubber piston 1010 that are large enough to sustain air flow between a lower side of the rubber piston 1016 and an upper side of the rubber piston 1018., 93438=The piston assembly 1013 rests in a central recess 1026 defined in the canister lid 1012. The central recess 1026 further defines matching passageways 1027 to sustain air flow between an upper portion 1028 of the lid 1012 and a lower portion 1030 of the lid 1012 when the passageways are unobstructed. The central recess passageways 1027 are alignable with the rubber piston passageways 1014 so that when the two sets of passageways are aligned, they are in direct communication with a corresponding pair of passageways in the piston assembly 1013.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While preferred embodiments of the invention have been described, it should be understood that the invention is not so limited and modifications may be made without departing from the invention. The scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims, and all devices that come within the meaning of the claims, either literally or by equivalence, are intended to be embraced therein. . The alignment allows ambient air to rush into the interior of the canister 1038. After the interior of the canister 1038 is equalized with the ambient air pressure, the lid 1012 can be easily removed for access to the contents of the canister 1038. FIG. 17 When the user desires to open the canister 1038 and allow ambient air back into the canister 1038, the knob 1002 is rotated in a clockwise direction causing the piston assembly 1013 to rotate. The knob is only capable of rotating approximately 45\ufffd due to tabs or similar means to stop rotation. This rotation aligns the central recess passageways 1027 with the rubber piston passageways 1014 as shown in After sufficient air exits the canister 1038, the air pressure between the upper portion 1028 of the lid 1012 and the lower portion 1030 of the lid 1012 equalizes, causing the piston assembly 1013 to descend to its original position. The vacuum source 15 can then be removed causing ambient air to",
