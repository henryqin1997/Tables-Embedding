    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{20014=I had my number one hit list buck shed very early this year too in GA. We've had plenty of rain and he lives in almost zero pressure so stress shouldn't be a factor either. I've had a lot of people say the same though about the 2012 year that a lot of bucks have shed early. I wonder if it will be indicative of an early rut..., 17861=My deer also started rubbing their antlers early here in mid-Michigan with a start date of August 26th (the earliest I have ever had) but I also had deer that did not finish rubbing until September 15th. I run seven camera's year round and was able to capture 26 different bucks on them in the center of the 300 acres I manage and hunt. I felt that because of the really dry weather that water would be the secret to sucess and it proved me right, the deer went to my springs like it was candy, It probaly won't work every year but they will always need water!, 28003=Copyright \u00a9 2012 QDMA. All Rights Reserved. Privacy Policy Powered by Caddis, 16713=Hi Kip, Saw this article on shedding with table up to 2012. Have you updated it for this year? It seems from the farm in Greenwich, NY that the shedding is later this year. We have not kept records, so that is just a gut feel. A few months ago I contacted you on my plans to go on vacation up in NY & Maine and spending a week in mid-August with my buddy Kevin getting the food plots ready, i.e cleaning, tilling, & planting. The ground was a little damp and a bit of rain after, so the plots are growing great. The photo below was taken a couple of weeks ago. Heading up to NY in mid-November & really looking forward to that. I am told the acorns & apples are plentiful this year. I may have to go stump sitting vs staying in my tree house. Are you aware of any portable tree house heaters I can buy?? Not making hunter season last year, I'm afraid this O'body has gotten too use to the warm weather of Florida. Good luck this year & hope all is well with you & your family, Tom Mac, 10189=Maybe the first buck to shed in 2012 was an anomaly, but the second buck (a 3.5+ year-old) shed on August 25, which was four days sooner than the next earliest date (in 2008). See photos of these two bucks in the Gallery below.\u00a0The third buck (1.5 years) shed on August 28., 15300=My buddy Kevin is going to the farm sometime this week to look at the cameras, it has been about 2 weeks. Hope to see some nice bucks, does & fawns. I would expect that the bucks have shed there velvet & they are starting to NOT like each other by now. I mentioned a while back that I wanted to do an article on my little corner of utopia & send it to Lindsay & you for your consideration of putting it in Quality Whitetail. I still want to do that & hope to do that after I get back to Florida in early December., 8833=Interestingly, bucks began shedding a full week earlier this year where I hunt in north-central Pennsylvania. How do I know this? I conduct an annual 14-day baited trail-camera survey every summer that always ends Labor Day weekend. Thus, the start date varies slightly, but it is always in late August. In addition to the great information the survey reveals about deer density, adult sex ratio, buck age structure and fawn recruitment rate, I also gather a ton of interesting anecdotal information like travel patterns of specific bucks, antler quality, and velvet shedding dates., 10483=Some have suggested that early velvet shedding is drought related. I disagree, as we are dry, but we\u2019re much luckier than most of the country, and we\u2019ve had more rain this summer than we did during summer 2011. Whatever the reason, it is fun to monitor this cycle, and we\u2019re blessed to watch hard-antlered bucks a little sooner than normal this year!}",

The chart below shows my survey start date, the first date a velvet-shed buck was photographed, and whether the first shed buck was young (1.5 to 2.5 years old) or older (3.5 years or older) based on body characteristics, for the past five years. This analysis does not suggest other bucks that I did not photograph did not shed sooner. However, given that I conducted the trail-camera surveys using the same method at the same five bait sites at the same relative time for each of the years listed, and photographed an average of 20 unique bucks each year, I\u2019m pretty confident the bucks using my family\u2019s property shed earlier than usual this year. Interestingly, bucks began shedding a full week earlier this year where I hunt in north-central Pennsylvania. How do",
