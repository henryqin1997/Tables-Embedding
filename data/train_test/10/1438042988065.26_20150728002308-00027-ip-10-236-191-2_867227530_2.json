Barr purchased the property in 2007 for $1.78\u00a0million.[86] Barr has studied Kabbalah at the Kabbalah Centre and frequently comments on the discipline.[87], 5285=After her sitcom ended, she launched her own talk show, The Roseanne Show, which aired from 1998 to 2000. In 2005, she returned to stand-up comedy with a world tour. In 2011, she starred in an unscripted TV show, Roseanne's Nuts, that lasted from July to September of that year, about her life on a Hawaiian farm., 13146=At 16, Barr was hit by a car that left her with a traumatic brain injury.[7] Her behavior changed so radically that she was institutionalized for eight months at Utah State Hospital.[9] In 1970, when Barr was 18 years old, she moved out by informing her parents she was going to visit a friend in Colorado for two weeks, but never returned.[9], 22424=Barr gave Amy Sherman-Palladino[20] and Joss Whedon[1] their first writing jobs on Roseanne. She released her autobiography in 1989, titled Roseanne\u2014My Life As a Woman.[21] That same year, she made her film debut in She-Devil, playing Ruth. Film critic Roger Ebert gave her a positive review saying, \"Barr could have made an easy, predictable and dumb comedy at any point in the last couple of years. Instead, she took her chances with an ambitious project \u2013 a real movie. It pays off, in that Barr demonstrates that there is a core of reality inside her TV persona, a core of identifiable human feelings like jealousy and pride, and they provide a sound foundation for her comic acting\".[22], 37376=On November 28, 2014, Barr's series, Momsters: When Moms Go Bad debuted on the Investigation Discovery cable network, a network that she says she's a 'little obsessed with.' Barr hosts the show as herself., 18764=Roseanne ran for nine seasons from 1988 to 1997. Barr won an Emmy, a Golden Globe, a Kids Choice Award, and three American Comedy Awards for her part in the show. For the final two seasons, Barr earned $40\u00a0million, making her the second-highest-paid woman in show business at the time, after Oprah Winfrey.[14], 49723=Barr has a lesbian sister, Geraldine Barr,[74][75] and a gay brother, Ben Barr,[74][75] both of whom inspired her to introduce gay characters into her sitcom.[76] Barr has stated that she supports gay marriage.[74] Geraldine was also Barr's manager while performing in comedy clubs and at the start of her sitcom. Geraldine claimed that Arnold tried to dominate Barr \"for his own reasons\".[77] After being fired by Roseanne, Geraldine filed a $70.3 million breach of contract lawsuit in Superior Court of Los Angeles County on December 18, 1991. She said Barr promised her half the earnings from the Roseanne show for helping invent the \"domestic goddess\" character in 1981, serving as \"writer, organizer, accountant, bookkeeper and confidante\".[78] Since it was six months past the statute of limitations, the suit was thrown out.[77], 39624=In 2014, the parents of George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch coordinator who is known for fatally shooting Trayvon Martin but was later acquitted of murder, filed a lawsuit against Barr for tweeting their home address and phone number on March 29, 2012. Barr allegedly tweeted \"At first I thought it was good to let ppl know that no one can hide anymore ... If Zimmerman isn't arrested I'll rt his address again- maybe go 2 his house myself.\"[48] Zimmerman's parents allege that Barr sought to \"cause a lynch mob to descend\" on their home. The Seminole County Circuit Court complaint sought more than $15,000 for emotional distress and invasion of privacy.[49][50] As of June 2015, the case is ongoing.[51], 36396=Barr was \"roasted\" by Comedy Central in August 2012.[43][44] Barr's former spouse, Tom Arnold, had claimed that he would not be appearing, but he ended up doing so.[45], 41219=On August 5, 2011, Barr appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and announced her candidacy for president in the 2012 presidential election, running on the \"Green Tea Party\" ticket.[52][53] Her candidacy mixes attention to economics, personal health and meditation.[54] She also said that she is running for Prime Minister of Israel. In an interview with The Jewish Daily Forward she invoked tikkun olam in her support of bringing women into politics and religion.[54] On September 19, 2011, she appeared at the Occupy Wall Street protests and spoke in support of the protestors.[55] She further stated that any \"guilty\" Wall Street bankers should be forced to give up any income over $100 million, be sent to re-education camps, or be executed by beheading if they resisted.[56], 2941=Roseanne Cherrie Barr (born November 3, 1952) is an American actress, comedian, writer, television producer, director, and 2012 presidential nominee of the California-based Peace and Freedom Party. Barr began her career in stand-up comedy at clubs before gaining fame for her role in the sitcom Roseanne. The show was a hit and lasted nine seasons, from 1988 to 1997. She won both an Emmy and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for her work on the show. Barr had crafted a \"fierce working-class domestic goddess\" persona in the eight years preceding her sitcom and wanted to do a realistic show about a strong mother who was not a victim of patriarchal consumerism.[1], 52080=In a 1991 interview with People, Barr described herself as an \"incest survivor\", accusing both of her parents of physical and sexual abuse,[79] claims which they and Geraldine publicly denied.[80] Melvin Belli, her parents' lawyer, said that they had passed a lie detector test \"with flying colors\".[80] Barr was even part of an incest recovery group, something she said her parents knew about but for which they were \"in denial\".[80] On February 14, 2011, Barr and Geraldine appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show where Barr admitted that the word \"incest\" could have been the wrong word to use and should have waited until her therapy was over before revealing the \"darkest time\" in her life.[81] She told Oprah, \"I was in a very unhappy relationship and I was prescribed numerous psychiatric drugs... to deal with the fact that I had some mental illness... I totally lost touch with reality... (and) I didn\u2019t know what the truth was... I just wanted to drop a bomb on my family\".[81] She added that not everything was \"made up\", saying, \"Nobody accuses their parents of abusing them without justification\".[81] Geraldine said they did not speak for 12 years, but had recently reconciled.[81], 37837=On July\u00a025,\u00a01990, Barr performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" before a baseball game between the San Diego Padres and Cincinnati Reds at Jack Murphy Stadium. As she later claimed, she was initially having trouble hearing herself over the public-address system, so she was singing as loudly as possible, and her rendition of the song sounded \"screechy\". Following her rendition, she mimicked the often-seen actions of players by spitting and grabbing her crotch as if adjusting a protective cup. Barr claimed she had been encouraged by baseball officials to \"bring humor to the song\". The song and the closing routine received heavy media attention and offended many, including President George H. W. Bush, who called her rendition \"disgraceful.\"[46] Barr would revisit this incident during her Comedy Central Roast in 2012, wherein she once again belted out the last few bars of the national anthem, without screeching.[47], 43254=Barr filed with the Federal Election Commission as a Green Party presidential candidate in January 2012. She formally announced her candidacy for the party's 2012 presidential nomination on February 2, 2012.[57][58][59][60], 29708=In March\u00a02008, she headlined an act at the Sahara Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip.[28] From 2009 to 2010, she hosted a politically themed radio show on KPFK.[30] Since 2008, she and partner Johnny Argent have hosted a weekly radio show on Sundays, on KCAA in the Los Angeles area, called \"The Roseanne and Johnny Show\".[31] On March\u00a023,\u00a02009 it was announced that Barr would be returning to primetime with a new sitcom, wherein she would once again play the matriarch. Jim Vallely of Arrested Development had been tapped to pen the series.[32] She later stated on her website that the project had been canceled., 45460=Shortly after losing the Green Party nomination, Barr announced she would run on the Peace and Freedom Party ticket with activist Cindy Sheehan as a running mate.[64] On August 4, 2012, Barr won the 2012 presidential nomination of the Peace and Freedom Party.[4][65], 16236=In 1987, The Cosby Show executive producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner wanted to bring a \"no-perks family comedy\" to television. They hired Cosby writer Matt Williams to write a script about factory workers and signed Barr to play Roseanne Conner.[12] The show premiered on October\u00a018,\u00a01988 and was watched by 21.4\u00a0million households, making it the highest-rated debut of that season.[13], 54827=Barr filed for divorce from Tom Arnold on April\u00a018,\u00a01994 in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, citing irreconcilable differences.[73] Their efforts to have children were unsuccessful.[82] On February\u00a014,\u00a01995, Barr married Ben Thomas, her one-time personal security guard, at Caesars Tahoe with a reception at Planet Hollywood. In November\u00a01994, she become pregnant through in-vitro fertilization[82] and they have a son named Buck.[83] The couple stayed together until 2002.[84], 48341=In 1970, when she was 17, Barr had a child whom she placed for adoption; they were later reunited.[7][71] On February\u00a04,\u00a01974, Barr married Bill Pentland, a motel clerk she met while in Colorado. They had three children: Jessica, Jennifer, and Jake.[71] Pentland and Barr divorced on January\u00a016,\u00a01990.[72] Four days later, on January\u00a020,\u00a01990, Barr married fellow comedian Tom Arnold and became known as Roseanne Arnold during the marriage. Barr had met Arnold in 1983 in Minneapolis, where he opened for her stand-up comedy act. In 1988, Barr brought Arnold onto her sitcom, Roseanne, as a writer.[73], 44158=On July 14, 2012, Barr came in second,[3] losing the nomination to Jill Stein.[3] Stein chose Cheri Honkala as her running-mate[61] despite suggestions that she could choose Barr.[62] Barr was given a prime speaking role at the Green Party National Convention in Baltimore, Maryland, but decided to instead send a surrogate (Farheen Hakeem) to speak on her behalf. Barr's surrogate reportedly chided the Party for not respecting Barr's candidacy. A shouting match in a hallway reportedly ensued.[63], 25491=In 1998, she portrayed the Wicked Witch of the West in a production of The Wizard of Oz at Madison Square Garden.[25] That same year, Barr hosted her own talk show, The Roseanne Show, which ran for two years before it was canceled in 2000. In the summer of 2003, she took on the dual role of hosting a cooking show called Domestic Goddess and starring in a reality show called The Real Roseanne Show about hosting a cooking show. Although 13 episodes were in production, a hysterectomy brought a premature end to both projects.[26] In 2004, she voiced Maggie, one of the main characters in the animated film Home on the Range., 34319=In August 2011, it was reported that Barr was working on a new sitcom with 20th Century Fox Television tentatively titled Downwardly Mobile.

The show will be set in a mobile home community and use a multiple-camera setup. In October 2011, NBC picked up the show.[40] A pilot was filmed but initially ended up being shelved by the network.[41] Barr blames her \"Progressive politics\" as being the sole reason behind the pilot's rejection. Barr states that she was notified that the show would not be picked up due to its being labeled \"too polarizing\" by network executives. In an interview with Politicker, Barr revealed that the show had been axed only to announce three hours later that she had just received a phone call saying that NBC had not given up on the project completely. The show could end up as an NBC midseason replacement. Barr hopes she's given the opportunity to retool the show.[42], 32685=Barr released her third book, Roseannearchy: Dispatches from the Nut Farm, in January 2011.[34] She appeared in 2011 on a Super Bowl XLV commercial for Snickers along with comedian Richard Lewis.

Roseanne's return to the stage culminated in an HBO Comedy Special Roseanne Barr: Blonde N Bitchin', which aired November\u00a04,\u00a02006, on HBO. Two nights earlier, Roseanne had returned to primetime network TV with a guest spot on NBC's My Name Is Earl, playing a crazy trailer park manager. In April\u00a02007, Barr hosted season three of The Search for the Funniest Mom in America on Nick at Nite.[29], 37015=In the summer of 2014 Roseanne joined Keenen Ivory Wayans and Russell Peters as a judge on Last Comic Standing on NBC., 14176=While in Colorado, Barr did stand-up gigs in clubs in Denver and other Colorado towns.

The success of her act led to her own series on ABC, called Roseanne., 23826=In 1991, she voiced the baby, Julie, in Look Who's Talking Too. She was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress.[23] She appeared three times on Saturday Night Live from 1991 to 1994, co-hosting with then-husband Tom Arnold in 1992.
