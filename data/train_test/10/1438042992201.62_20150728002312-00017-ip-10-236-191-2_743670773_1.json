Those mileages should be accurate to 0.01-0.02 miles., 90858=I have also found four occurrences of the true R. californicus population in Southern California, at Laurel Canyon in Orange County; East Grade Project Road in the eastern Palomar Mountains; and the Kelly Ditch Trail and Garnet Peak Trail / Penny Pines Trailhead in the Laguna Mountains. Those populations are quite different from these plants, with the expected 8 and more petals that are ~two times longer than wide., 21165=I didn't keep track of the changes separately for 3/10/05 and 3/16/05. Prior to 3/10/05, the last portion of the trail was different, which affected only a single species. The 4/7/05 numbers reflect the new alignment of the trail, and also include a new taxon found on Ranch Road near the end of the trail that appeared for the first time in 2005. On 10/15/05, I added the section along Ranch Road, resulting in the addition of 8 taxa. Hence there are two entries in the table above for 10/15/05; the first one is for the previously-defined route., 22066=I began using the \"~\" symbol in June 2002 and the \"sp\" symbol in August 2002; those categories were given the \"?\" symbol prior to those dates (we updated the 5/10/02 numbers to reflect our current usage.) I didn't record the numbers after some of the updates, especially the minor later ones., 90650=I have since found another population that appears to be similar to the SRP population at Palomar State Park. These two populations appear to be the southernmost outposts of R. occidentalis., 91294=The \"problem\" with a Ranunculus occidentalis id may be simply that this species is not supposed to occur south of the Tehachapi Mountains. This was the botanical wisdom prior to the discovering of these populations of plants at the SRP and at Palomar Mountain, since those areas had not been surveyed at the time that wisdom was stated. This is not a compelling reason to accept the other id, especially since the SRP contains other taxa that are not \"supposed to be\" in Southern California, such as Plagiobothrys fulvus., 21723=In addition to the trips above, which concentrated on the plant guide, I made literally dozens of trips in 2001 and recorded the plants that were blooming. Those observations were used to augment the 2002-observed plant list on 2/21/02. Some of those species were never observed on this trail in 2002 due to the severe drought then., 22795=30 March 2004, 92687=Polygonum lapathifolium. A single plant germinated in the Main Pool in 2005, but died before reaching maturity. This species cannot survive here, since there is no source of water that remains below ground once the pool dries up., 94264=Copyright \u00a9 2002-2006 by Tom Chester.

I had 90 trails in our database when this histogram was made; 16 of those trails, including this one, are at the Santa Rosa Plateau Ecological Reserve.

Number of Unique Taxa On This Trail The botanical highlights of this trail are: Highlights of This Trail There are still many vernal pools left in Southern California, but most of them are on military or private land, and are not easily accessible. Furthermore, this is the only example of a basalt-based vernal pool. All the other pools in Southern California are underlain by hardpan, and the vast majority of them are much smaller than our Main Pool. Perversely, because we humans treasure rare things more than common things, we now value these vernal pool plants very highly (which is a good thing!). This trail allows a fantastic look at these plants because it contains a boardwalk over the largest pool at the Santa Rosa Plateau. The remaining plants have become endangered. They've become endangered not because they are rare delicate species, or on their way out in evolution; they've become",
