Beach time hadn't been on our criteria but we do like the thought of spending our last few days on a beach. We definitely want to use flights as a means to be able to see more destinations but don't want to miss any transportations routes that are must-do's themselves. We read somewhere about the slow-boat (possibly from Thailand to Laos) for 2/3 days, can anybody offer any advice on that? Currently, we are thinking something along these lines. 11th June - Arrive in Bangkok 12th June - Bangkok 13th June - Bangkok 14th June - Fly to Chiang Mai 15th June - Chiang Mai 16th June - Chiang Mai 17th June - Fly to Luang Prabang 18th June - Luang Prabang 19th June - Luang Prabang 20th June - Vang Vieng 21st June - Vang Vieng 22nd June - Vientiane 23rd June - Vientiane 24th June - Vientiane 25th June - Fly to Hanoi 26th June - Hanoi 27th June - Ha Long Bay 28th June - Ha Long Bay 29th June - Fly to Hue 30th June - Hue 1st July - Hoi An 2nd July - Hoi An 3rd July - Fly to Ho Chi Minh City 4th July - Ho Chi Minh City 5th July - Ho Chi Minh City 6th July - Mekong river delta 7th July - Fly to Phu Quoc Island 8th July - Phu Quoc Island 9th July - Phu Quoc Island 10th July - Fly to Phnom Penh 11th July - Phnom Penh 12th July - Siem Reap 13th July - Siem Reap 14th July - Siem Reap 15th July - Morning flight to Bangkok, fly home from Bangkok (night flight) Sorry for the long list. Please would people give their view on this itinerary. As previously stated, I know many people wouldn't travel in such a 'rush' but if you WERE to do it this way, do you think this seems a reasonable plan? We are looking for advice on each place, as to whether we should spend less or more days there? If people recommend more then perhaps we would look at taking a place out or spending less somewhere else. Does there appear to be anywhere that we aren't going that is a generic 'MUST' destination? Again, this is only a plan outline and by no means is set in stone, that's why we are looking for advice and feedback haha! Thanks again!

A few old concentration camps like Dachau are kicking around. Most of the relics are long gone though. Most tourists who go to Germany are going to events like the over-priced, over-hyped October Fest and Neuschwanstein. In most towns and cities you'll find nothing at all related to the way - maybe some war memorial to the dead. The KR period was short and horrific. I can understand why people go - I went - to see places like that. But I won't take my wife or daughter. My knows what happened and I can tell my daughter what happened without her visiting these kinds of places. I would never describe any one place as a \"must see\" for anyone on vacation because we all have different tastes. But I most certainly would not call Tuol Sleng or the killing fields \"must sees\". They are historical for sure. But if you are on vacation to enjoy yourself and relax and decompress then they are the last places you want to go see., 9610=#44 Posted: 10/6/2014 - 07:02, 63590=#9 Posted: 3/6/2014 - 23:46, 23465=#33 Posted: 9/6/2014 - 01:21, 71288=#4 Posted: 24/5/2014 - 06:09, 50071=Joined Travelfish 11th May, 2014 Posts: 40, 10491=#43 Posted: 10/6/2014 - 06:39, 74325=Joined Travelfish 3rd March, 2010 Location China Posts: 1281 Total reviews: 53 Places visited: At least 48, 33559=#25 Posted: 8/6/2014 - 10:31, 6959=#46 Posted: 10/6/2014 - 09:07, 16676=#38 Posted: 9/6/2014 - 14:50, 70318=#5 Posted: 24/5/2014 - 12:26, 42408=#20 Posted: 7/6/2014 - 03:59, 77336=Hi, Me and my girlfriend are spending 5 weeks, mid-June to mid-July, around SE Asia. We haven't planned much of an itinerary as we have just finished university and wanted it to be a spur of the moment plan. We have 3 weeks to plan it and in terms of criteria we would like to do some sightseeing, cultural activities, possibly a jungle trek, and any MUST see places. Nightlife is not of as great importance to us but we would still like to sample it. We are just looking for some advice on places within each country people who have experience them would recommend, we appreciate any help. Thanks!
