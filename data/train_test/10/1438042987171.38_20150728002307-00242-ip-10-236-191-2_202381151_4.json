The yearly tables include the date the Corrective Action Order was issued, the name of the operator involved, the PHMSA Region initiating the enforcement action(s), the corresponding date on which the case was closed, and PHMSA's unique case number. Corrective Action Orders identify the specific corrective actions an operator must take to address conditions that may be hazardous to people, property, or the environment. Only after PHMSA verifies that all actions specified in Corrective Action Orders have been satisfactorily completed and the facility is no longer hazardous is the case closed. Corrective Action Orders are described in 49 CFR 190.233.}",
