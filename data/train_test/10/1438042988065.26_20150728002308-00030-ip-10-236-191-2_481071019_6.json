In FIG. 13, there is provided a network device 1308 for updating the software of at least one other device 1302 in a same network 1300 as the network device 1308. The network device 1308 can include: a memory 1310 that can store update information relating to another device 1302 in network 1300; a transceiving unit 1314 configured to communicate with the other device 1302 and an update server 1350, via the Internet, for example; and a control circuit 1312 configured to perform a number of functions, including, for example, determining whether the updating of software of the other network device 1302 is required based on update information. In an alternative exemplary embodiment of the above-described network device 1308, the memory 1310 for storing update information relating to another device can be omitted as a component of the network device 1308.

The device A 702 accesses directly the Internet 714 to download its update information and files for updating from the update server 718., 67520=Next, the control device 1108 sends the device B 1104 the files provided from the device A 1102, using an update response message 1218. When the device B 1104 completes updating using the files, it sends the control device 1108 an update complete message 1222 to inform the control device 1108 of this fact. A progress or result of updating is informed to the control device 1108 using an update status message 1220. This process may be performed by generating an event using eigen variables of a vendor such as an update status variable, and providing the event to the control device 1108 in the UPnP network., 66623=Next, the control device 1108 informs the device B 1104 that updating is available, using an update available message 1214. Then, the device B 1104 prepares updating and requests the control device 1108 to update the software of the device B 1104 using an update request message 1216., 61387=Then, the control device 908 sends an update available message 1006 to the device A 902., 64732=Next, the control device 1108 requests the device A 1102 to provide it with files required to update the software of the device B 1104., 61985=When the device A 902 completes updating using the downloaded files, it sends the control device 908 an update complete message 1012 so as to inform that the updating is completed. A progress or result of the updating is informed to the control device 908 through an update status message 1014. This process may be performed by generating an event in the UPnP network using eigen variables of a vendor such as an update status variable., 29346=This application claims the priority of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2004-0061945,, filed on Aug. 6, 2004,, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference., 63915=The device A 1102 obtains the update information regarding the device B 1104 from the update server 1118 and provides it to the control device 1108. Next, the control device 1108 displays the update information on a display unit 1108 a., 66989=The control device 1108 requests the device A 1102 to perform updating, using an update request message 1210. The device A 1102 downloads files required for updating from the update server 1118 in real time and provides them to the control device 1108 using an update response message 1212. Alternatively, the device A 1102 may provide the control device 1118 with files that were stored, using the update response message 1212., 66262=When updating is required, the control device 1108 informs a user of this fact via the display unit 1108 a. The user instructs the control device 1108 to update the software of the device B 1104 via the input device 1110 such as a remote controller, a keyboard, a touch pad, or a mouse., 61529=The device A 902 sends an update request message 1008 to the control device 908, the control device 908 downloads files required for updating from the update server 918 in response to the update request message 1008, and provides the device A 902 with the files through an update response message 1010. This process may be performed in real time or through buffering., 65760=The control device 1108 sends the device A 1102 an update check request message 1202. Then, the device A 1102 accesses the update server 1118 to determine whether updating of the software of the device B 1104 is required, based on the URL 502 and the software version information 504, and provides the result of determination to the control device 1108 through an update check response message 1208., 64235=A user views the update information on the display unit 1108 a, and instructs the control device 1108 to update the software of the device B 1104 via an input unit 1110 such as a remote controller. Then, the control device 1108 sends this instruction to the device B 1104, and the device B 1104 prepares updating and requests the control device 1108 to update the software of the device B 1104.}",
