Palmer was sentenced to death for the murders and was executed by lethal injection Sept. 20, 2012., 77761=Copyright \u00a9 2015 archive.zanesvilletimesrecorder.com. All rights reserved. Users of this site agree to the Terms of Service, Privacy Notice/Your California Privacy Rights, and Ad Choices, 35978=Since Jan. 1, 2001, more than 1,900 people have applied for commutations and 79 have been granted hearings. Of those, 45 were given favorable recommendations from the parole board, according to Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction data., 36554=The last, and only, hearing in the past two and a half years occurred in April. Brittany Wilmoth, 24, applied for a commutation of her four-year sentence on robbery and theft from Brown County. The parole board did not recommend her release, and the application remains on Kasich\u0092s desk., 36861=The lack of hearings isn\u0092t the only concern. Jamie Blose questioned why offenders must wait two years from the time the governor responds to apply again. Although James Blose first applied for commutation in August 2010, he must wait till March 2014 to try again., 27915=But Blose, 77, is one of hundreds of applicants the state parole board says don\u0092t need further review. In fact, only one case in more than 550 has warranted a hearing in two and a half years. Hearings have always been rare for applicants, typically the most serious offenders in prison, but 2010 and 2011 were the only years without meetings on such cases in more than a decade., 22989=1) The individual files an application for executive clemency with the Ohio Parole Board, including letters of support, the inmate\u0092s institutional record and an explanation of why the application has merit. Many file these applications without an attorney. There are three kinds of clemency: pardons, commutations and reprieves. A pardon, which is the most common form of clemency, relieves a person from all or some of the ramifications of a sentence, such as a person who cannot get a license for a profession because of a felony conviction. A commutation replaces a longer sentence with a shorter sentence; all death penalty cases receive a commutation hearing automatically. A reprieve \u0097 which is the most rare form of clemency with only nine filed this decade \u0097 postpones the sentence. Although all go before the Ohio Parole Board, clemency cases are not \u0093parole hearings,\u0094 which are a separate process that allows offenders to plead their case at specific times depending on the length of their sentences. 2) A parole board investigator may interview the offender about the application. The victim or a victim\u0092s representative, prosecutor, judge and law enforcement agency involved are notified and can weigh in. 3) The 11-member Ohio Parole Board, composed of individuals with victim\u0092s rights, prison and public defender backgrounds, votes electronically on whether the application has merit for a hearing or submit an unfavorable recommendation to the governor without further consideration. Many decisions are made without all members voting; only a majority is needed. The director of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, currently Gary Mohr, appoints up to 12 parole board members with experience in correctional work, law, social work or a combination of the three; one member must serve as the victims\u0092 representative. Starting Sept. 30, 2011, members were limited to a pair of six-year terms, except for the chairperson and victims\u0092 representative. Current members are paid between $81,251 and $100,876. 4) If a hearing is merited, the parole board will meet the applicant and other interested parties, including the victim and law enforcement. A favorable or unfavorable recommendation is sent to the governor after the hearing. Only one hearing on a non-death penalty commutation has been held since January 2011. 5) The governor reviews the application and parole board\u0092s recommendation and makes his decision. Kasich has no deadline, but often responds within six or seven months of receiving the recommendation. If the applicant is denied, the individual can apply again in two years. Source: Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, 28412=Blose, a college graduate and honorably discharged U.S. Air Force veteran, killed his third wife in 2000 during a fight that ended with him shooting her four times from less than a foot away. She was having an affair, he was having suicidal thoughts, but everyone agreed Blose deserved prison., 34244=\u0093My co-defendant did it. I totally messed up everything from that point on,\u0094 Hill said. \u0093I\u0092m not asking in my commutation to be released, I\u0092m asking for the opportunity to start asking for a second chance to start the process. ... Right now as it stands, I don\u0092t see them till 2049.\u0094, 33225=On May 8, 1989, Hill hit Charles Sponholtz\u0092s truck on a Belmont County Road. Hill\u0092s brother-in-law and passenger, Donald Palmer, got into a fight with Sponholtz, ultimately shooting him. Palmer also fatally shot Steven Vargo, a driver who stopped to see what happened and help., 30272=The drought of hearings comes as the Ohio prison system struggles with overcrowding and rising costs. The prison population has increased by 11.1 percent in the past decade and is expected to increase by another 3,000 inmates by 2019, according to a legislative oversight committee\u0092s report. On average, it costs $22,836 to house an inmate for a year, but older, sicker prisoners such as Blose often cost more.}",
