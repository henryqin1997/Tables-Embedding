His first 14 races on this track featured two wins, nine top-fives, and only one result outside the top 12. He blew an engine in the 2011 Pure Michigan 400 to snap a long top-15 streak and he blew his qualification lap in this race last year, but after starting 42nd he earned a lot of place differential points to finish 11th. Edwards should be a favorite, but this team is lacking confidence at the moment after a disappointing 18th-place finish with what the driver described as an 18th-place car., 113690=\u00a9 2015 NASCAR Media Group, LLC. All Rights Reserved., 88502=In order to improve their reliability Toyota has detuned their engines slightly, but a small lack of horsepower could mean the difference between battling for a win and struggling to stay in the top 10. This is also one of the tracks on which they suffered last year; Kyle Busch and Mark Martin both experienced engine trouble in June, which might not be a huge concern if not for the current situation. Bowyer is the only Toyota driver who swept the top 10 last year, so the manufacturer does not have very much momentum on their side and players will want to take a cautious approach on tracks that require a lot of horsepower.}",

Even though long streaks have been difficult to maintain, drivers were very reliable last year in Michigan\u2019s two races. Five drivers finished in precisely the same position in the Quicken Loans 400 and Pure Michigan 400, with Clint Bowyer recording the best result of seventh. Notably, he finished 2011\u2019s pair of races in eighth and is the only driver with more than two consecutive top-10s. In total, half of the field finished the summer race within six positions of how they ran in the spring and this week\u2019s list of favorites will come from last year\u2019s success stories. The Favorites Greg Biffle limped into Pocono Raceway last week with six consecutive results of 13th or worse. His average finish of 25th in that span of races virtually ensured that few players had him active on their NASCAR Fantasy Live roster, but he raced among the top 10 for most of the day. That was a great time to develop some momentum because he heads to a track where he was almost perfect last year. He finished fourth in the spring race and won the Pure Michigan 400.
