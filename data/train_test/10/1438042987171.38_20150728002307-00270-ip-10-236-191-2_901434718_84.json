            "The University of Delaware actually started the blue light system, which you may see on other campuses. This system has blue lights with alarm buttons positioned around campus so that at every light you are able to see at least two others. Additionally, there is Campus Public Safety which can be called at any time a student is not feeling safe and needs a ride or walk home.",
            "There are SO many clubs on this campus! And like I said before, it is really easy to start your own club and receive school funding if you having a great idea for a new club. We also have a wide range of sports teams as well as club sports at different levels so that any interested students can participate.",
            "There are many clubs on campus you can join for fun, and if there aren't any you like (which I doubt will be the case) it is really easy to make one. Main Street is also a fun hang out for a lot of students due to the range of shops as well as dining places it offers at a very short distance from the center of campus. The sporting games are also really fun to attend, although slightly difficult to get to if you are unable to catch a bus or do not have a car on campus.",
            "The food was good, but could have been better. The dining halls and other eating areas, such as Trabant, are also fairly crowded making it difficult to find seating sometimes. However, they do offer a range of dining plans that should allow you to cater to your needs.",
            "I loved living in the dorms when I lived on campus. The RAs always tried to set up a lot of activities for the residents and the staff was good at keeping the dorms clean. UD is also currently building a brand new complex on East campus, modeled after the very highly ranked dorms on North campus.",
            "The University of Delaware is a highly accredited institution with very knowledgeable professors and does not take classes lightly. If you attend this University, expect to work hard to achieve high grades. When you complete your degree and graduate you will definitely be well-prepared for your field.",
            "If you're thinking about UD definitely try to visit it in order to get a better feel for the campus. UD's campus is really beautiful and has a great Main Street that runs through it that is really popular among students. So visit and see if you can picture yourself there. If you can, I'm sure UD has the major you're looking for.",
            "University of Delaware is a great mid-sized mid-Atlantic school set in the middle of Newark, a small city with a student-friendly Main Street. UD offers a wide range of majors allowing for a very diverse student body. Over the years, I have found UD is constantly trying to improve itself and keep up with environmentally healthy trends."

Proud to be a Blue Hen!, 426449=Starting with the class of 2016, there is a candlelight ceremony for the freshmen on South Green initiating their college experience., 230758=New d-hall coming 2015. It is supposed to be largest on East Coast!!!!!!, 571379=there are a BILLION different clubs- go to Activities night during 1743 days and use stUDent Central to find others., 215291=There are so many different clubs and activities on campus. There is no reason to spend all of your free time sitting in your dorm. During 1743 Welcome Weekend, there will be events where student organizations and clubs set up tables in the student centers, and freshman can walk through, ask questions, and sign up to join clubs. There's a club for everything. Everything., 615935=Being from Delaware, University of Delaware (UD) was the last school I was interested in attending because like so many others I wanted an out-of-state adventure. But upon starting at UD in the fall of 2013, I not only fully embrace my new hometown university but also cringed at the idea of experiencing college at any other academic institution. The University of Delaware has stolen my heart with its beautiful campus, excellent professors and various study abroad options, and the amazing extracurricular/greek/social options., 376108=Most of the dorms are nearly new and very nice inside! There are a few old dorms that are currently being remodeled and should be finished by the summer of 2013., 563635=In 2015, almost all the freshman dorms will be very new, but it honestly doesn't matter where you live on campus because everyone loves their dorm. I'm a freshman and I live in one of the oldest dorms on campus and I wouldn't trade it for the world. I love it. Wherever you live on campus, students are guaranteed a great time., 624246=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 229774=1743 days Kirkbride jesus Grottos, 547470=Like most universities, the University of Delaware has it's share of unusual things around campus. One of these would be the Techno Bus Driver. If you ever ride the bus around campus there is a chance that you could ride of his bus. Another unusual thing at the University would be Kirkbride Jesus. This guy stands right outside Kirkbride lecture hall and preaches the word of God every Wednesday at 1:00 p.m. Many enjoy siting and listening to him as well as the people just walking by. There are many others, but to know them you will have to become a Blue Hen to find out!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Music students, those who enjoy peer encouragement/feedback on their work, honors students. I just wanted to write a message for people who are concerned that Delaware is a party school...on any given weekend (probably weeknight, for that matter) lots of people will be interested in going out and drinking, and lots of parties are available nearby to cater to that. But really, if you're being true in your friendships, you'll find people who prefer watching a movie or playing board games, and you'll find school-sponsored activities or performances to enjoy. While I don't consider myself a partier and spend a lot of my weekends in, I do appreciate that if I do want to go out, I can easily find a party. And I feel no pressure to drink. It's just a matter of finding a group of friends who enjoy the same activities that you do. Tips for prospective students Apply to the honors program; I'm currently in it and am enjoying the challenging and engaging classes. Honors students all live together, and it's really nice that on weeknights or Sundays, when we have to buckle down, we either sit in the hallway or the lounge and study together. We all might be stressed about classes and wanting to put off our work, but the fact that everyone around you is studying makes it easier. It's also nice to",
