A page has a few required attributes. Each page must have a pageName and at least one domElement. The pageName is heavily used in features and it should be meaningful so that testers know exactly website page it refers to. DomElements are the web page elements used to validate the software. Typically , they refer to label values, drop-down values, images, buttons, data displayed (pricing, etc.). The name of these elements should be meaningful so that the test writers understand each component\u2019s purpose. Test configurators need to have experience with some web technologies such as jQuery. Test configurators need to create a page for each website page to be accessed. Test Configurators are the key to properly configuring a Jazz Automation test. Jazz Automation supports both JSON and XML for page configuration. On to Page Configuration First we notice the /features directory. This where all test specifications should reside. The file is of type .feature.

Test configurators are required to know one of the following: jQuery, XPath, or CSS. We use these to \u2018select\u2019 the web elements needed for testing. JQuery is the preferred selector mechanism for Jazz Automation, and most QA analysts can pick up jQuery in a few days, especially with all the online tutorials and modern-day web browser developer tools available. General Configuration The final item for discussion is the required jazz.properties file. This configuration file contains a few general configuration items such as the project name (used in reporting), a flag indicating if the tests should be run remotely or on the local system, action and page pace, and the features to be executed. There are additional optional configuration properties that have been omitted.  #project name projectName: Amazon # turn on remote support. if useRemote true, you must specify the following remoteWebDriverUrl property. useRemote: false # remote web driver url - usually your sauceLabs url remoteWebDriverUrl: http://jazzautomation:****@ondemand.saucelabs.com:80/wd/hub # you can customize you folder name of pages.
