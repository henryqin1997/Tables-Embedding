            "There is a club/organization for everybody.",
            "Case is great for students who really care about their futures and want to succeed. Everyone here is pretty driven.",
            "One awesome thing about the campus is the myriad of statues around campus. Some make sense, and some you have to stare at to understand. It's pretty cool and every statue has its own history.",
            "Worth it.",
            "There's lots to do on the campus and around Cleveland; just make sure you're involved on campus and join clubs/Greek life.Doing so definitely increases your chances of having fun.",
            "The dining halls aren't awful. Some days I really enjoy the food, and some days i don't. Overall, it's alright - and I'm pretty picky.",
            "I made some of my best friends living in the freshman dorms. Case is great for building community.",
            "Case is a tough school, but there are so many resources to help you do well.",
            "If you have AP credits, your time here will be made easier. Pre-requisites for freshmen can be quite difficult, especially since you are making a tough transition. Get those first level Chemistry, Math, Physics, etc., courses out of the way if you can.",
            "CWRU is a great school. Of course, it's not perfect, but one thing that really distinguishes Case is the amount of opportunities students here have. If you are interested in a school that truly cares about you, Case is the place to be."

There is a pumpkin throwing every Halloween, Homecoming weekend is important, a campus wide service day every September or October, and the cycle club does free bike tune ups every fall, Hudson Relays, Halloween at Home, and study overs to name a few., 16625=This school is great for student who enjoy cold climates. Cleveland receives tons of snow from November to April. Students who are interested in Medicine, Art, Music, and Engineering will find a home at CWRU., 303729=I've only lived in freshman housing and then one of the nicest Greek houses on campus, so I can't speak for the sophomore or upperclassmen housing from experience. However, what I do know is that you are paying a lot of money for some ehhhhhh housing. Freshman dorms were pretty drab. Sophomore housing is in a suite style which is nice, but the singles are horrifically small and cramped. Maintenance is pretty unreliable; I had a friend whose heat went out in January, and it took two maintenance requests, two phone calls, and finally a visit to undergraduate services to have something done about it. And if you know anything about winter in Cleveland, you don't want your heat out for ten minutes, let alone three days. However, DON'T take that as a reason not to come here or to live on campus. The way the dorms are laid out makes it so easy to socialize with friends, especially in your first year. Laundry is FREE!!! Overall a positive experience that I have loved, especially being in my Greek house. Be sure to bundle up in the winter because it is about a 15 minute walk to the main quad from north side and 10 minutes from south side.}",

If you are content discussing pokemon and star trek for hours, then you will fit right in. If you want to party with friends, then you will also fit in. However, you might have to limit yourself to one night during the weekends, and do work during the other. Tips for prospective students Don't be afraid to check out Case Greek life. It doesn't fit the normal stereotype, and you will meet a lot of great friends. Go to the book swap",
