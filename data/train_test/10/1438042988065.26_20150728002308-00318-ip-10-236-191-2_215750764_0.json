The Peaks You must record the route of the trip, the location of your campsites and the date you climbed each peak in your summit log. You can summit multiple peaks during a backpacking trip. You can\u2019t stay at an AMC hut or RMC hut during your trip unless the hut is a lean-to/shelter with one open side. This means that The Perch (RMC), The Log Cabin (RMC) and Guyot Campsite (AMC) are legal campsites but that Crag Camp (RMC) and Madison Hut (AMC) are not. The only exception to this rule is Cabot Cabin. You only get credit for a peaks you climb on an overnight backpacking trip. In the interest of simplicity, the Backpacker\u2019s 48 includes all 48 peaks on the AMC 4000 footer list. Here are the rules: The Rules The Backpacker\u2019s 48 is not for everyone, but it is a very different way to experience the White Mountain 4000 footers. It\u2019s really just a personal list that I\u2019m working on, but if you\u2019d like to do it too, by all means. Maybe we can even make it an institution someday. For example, take the Bonds (Mt Bond, West Bond, and Bondcliff)\u00a0 which are one of the longest single day peakbagging hikes you can do in the Whites.\u00a0 Most peakbaggers hike the Bonds by doing an 22.6 mile out and back from the Lincoln Woods trailhead on",
