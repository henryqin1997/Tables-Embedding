In one embodiment, the predetermined voltage VR is equal to the complement of the input voltage VIN \u2014 B. In an alternate embodiment, the predetermined voltage VR is equal to VREFM. A PMOS preamplifier 1252 provides outputs VPDATA and VPDATA \u2014 B. An NMOS preamplifier 1254 provides outputs VNDATA and VNDATA \u2014 B. The PMOS and NMOS preamplifiers 1252 and 1254 operate in the same way as the PMOS and NMOS preamplifiers 1200 and 1170 of FIGS. 45A and 45B, respectively, except that the predetermined voltage VR is used, and the load resistors R are implemented with transistors.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{326175=To control the data rate, at the beginning of system operation, a pattern generator 1530 exchanges data with the memories 322, and determines the error rate. If the error rate is above a predetermined threshold, 2-PAM signaling is used. In one implementation, the pattern generator periodically determines the error rate, and determines whether to operate the system at 2-PAM or 4-PAM., 280377=In an alternate embodiment, the MSB and LSB integrators, 1121 and 1124, respectively, are not used, and the sense amplifier of FIG. 15 is used. In other words, a sense amplifier of FIG. 15, which performs the integration function within the sense amplifier, replaces each integrator-sense amplifier pair., 277989=In the MSB receiver 1112, the input voltage VIN is compared to the reference voltage VREFM to generate the MSB. In the LSB receiver 1114, the input voltage VIN is compared to the VREFL0 and VREFL1 reference voltages to generate the LSB., 278998=The MSB integrators 1121 output two pairs of differential integration voltages on nodes A, B, C, and D. In one implementation, the MSB integrators 1121 use the integrator of FIG. 11C. In another implementation, the MSB integrators 1121 use the integrator of FIG. 12. Each MSB integrator 1121 supplies the integration voltages to the corresponding (even or odd) MSB Sense Amplifier 1122. In one implementation, the MSB sense amplifiers 1122 use the sense amplifier of FIG. 14A. In an alternate implementation, the MSB sense amplifiers 1122 use the sense amplifier of FIG. 14B., 283007=The timing of the receive clock signal is such that the latching comparators 1132-1136 sample the input data between 4-PAM signal transitions. Because data is sent on both edges of the receive clock, two receiver circuits 1130 are used\u2014one for odd data, and one for even data., 315761=Because the receiver delay generators provide a fixed or \u201coverhead\u201d delay in addition to the specified delay, delay element 1407 provides that same amount of delay to the true system clock signal to generate the sense signal to provide a desired phase relationship between the precharge and sense signals. To generate the sense signal, a delay element 1407 delays the true system signal for the same amount of time as the receiver delay generators 1404. In one implementation of delay element 1407, the true system clock is delayed by four inverters 1408, which provide the same delay as the fixed or inherent delay of delay generator blocks 1404. Two phase splitters 1410 generate the true and complementary sense signals for the even and odd data. In an ideal embodiment, the receiver delay generators 1404 do not provide the fixed amount of delay in addition to the specified delay, and the delay element 1407 is not used., 321252=In the odd mode output driver 1480, a logic circuit 1484, discussed above, receive the odd LSB and MSB from another circuit, such as a memory 1486. The logic circuit 1484 generates the multi-PAM A, B, and C signals, discussed above, which are supplied to the multi-PAM decoder 1488. The multi-PAM decoder 1488 outputs three voltage levels VA, VB and VC which are supplied to an output driver 1490., 256480=In the combinational logic 1007, an OR gate 1008 generates the A signal by performing an OR operation between the LSB and MSB. The B input is the MSB. An AND gate 1009 generates the C signal by performing an AND operation between the LSB and MSB., 258245=When the output driver sinks output current from the I/O pin 956, current is steered through transistor N1 1012 to ground. When transistor N1 1012 is inactive, transistor N2 1014 becomes active to allow the same or substantially the same amount of current to flow to ground. In this way, a substantially constant amount of current continuously flows to ground to eliminate a large portion of the output driver switching noise and provide a quieter on-chip ground, thereby improving the performance of the 4-PAM signaling. The signal VR that controls transistor N2 1014, is the complement of the signal Vi, the signal that drives transistor N1 1012. Alternately the signal VR that drives transistor N2 1014 is a reference voltage between ground and Vi. In response to an input voltage VCntrl, the current source 1016 sinks a predetermined amount of current Io to ground., 269001=Referring to FIGS. 38, 39A and 39B, the operation of the circuit 1050 including the state machine 1064 will be described. The flowchart of FIG. 39 uses gray coded output voltages.

The combinational logic circuit 1007 of FIG. 33B is the same as the combinational logic circuit 1007 of FIG. 33A except that, to generate the C signal, the AND gate 1009 a receives the complement of the LSB rather than the LSB., 317508=To increase the amount of delay, selectable delay elements 1422 are connected to the nodes 1423-1, 1423-2 between the inverters of the first set of inverters 1418. Window control 1 controls selectable delay elements 1422-1 and 1422-2. Window control 2 controls selectable delay elements 1422-3 and 1422-4. Pairs of selectable delay elements are binary weighted. Selectable delay elements 1422-3 and 1422-4 add twice as much delay as selectable delay elements 1422-1 and 1422-2. Each selectable delay element increases the amount of delay to the input signal. Since the selectable delay elements are the same, except for the binary weighting, the operation of selectable delay element 1422-1 will be described. When window control 1 is activated, passgate pair 1424 becomes active and couples a delay element 1426 to the first set of inverters 1418. In the delay element 1426, first and second delay blocks, 1428 and 1430, respectively, are connected in series between the supply voltage and ground.

The MSB and LSB sense amplifiers, 1128 and 1129, respectively, are the same as the MSB and LSB sense amplifiers of FIG. 41. In one implementation, the MSB integrators 1126 use the circuit of FIG. 11B. In an alternate implementation, the MSB integrators 1126 use the circuit of FIG. 11C., 325034=FIG. 54C is a diagram of an exemplary data bus operating at 4-PAM using the device of FIG. 54A. The master device 1524 and memory devices 1526 operate at 4-PAM., 285806=To produce the LSB from the Gray-coded 4-PAM levels, when the input voltage VIN is between that of VREFL0 and VREFL1, the differential transistor pairs 1157-1 and 1157-2, provide an output voltage VLP equal to the supply voltage VDD.

In step 1570, the system is operated at 4-PAM. In step 1572, if an error occurs, the LSB and MSB are switched and the system continues to operate at 4-PAM. In other words, a first binary digit is assigned as the LSB, and a second binary digit is assigned as the MSB. To switch the LSB and MSB, the first binary digit is assigned as the MSB and the second binary digit is assigned as the LSB in both the transmitter (output driver) and receiver. In this way, the signature of the transmitted data is changed, and the error may be corrected. In step 1574, if another error occurs, the system is then operated at 2-PAM, which is standard binary signaling. In step 1576, if yet another error occurs, the speed of the data bus is reduced, and the system continues to operate at 2-PAM. In step 1578, while the system is operating, the error-free time is continuously monitored and measured. When the error-free time equals a first predetermined time, the speed of the data bus is increased, and the system continues to operate at 2-PAM. Repeatedly, when the error-free time equals a second predetermined time, the speed of the data bus is increased, the second predetermined time is incremented, and the system continues to operate at 2-PAM, until the second predetermined time equals a PAM threshold value. When the second predetermined time equal the PAM threshold value, the system is operated at 4-PAM., 305629=In FIG. 47, a LSB folded integrator 1330 combines the function of comparing the reference voltages with the integration process. In particular, the integrator 1330 is used to determine the LSB. The PAM input signal may be supplied directly to the integrator 1330 via the bus without going through the preamplifier.

The current control calibration circuit 1050 determines settings for each of the sets of current control bits CC, CCB and CCC for each 4-PAM output voltage such that VOUT-1 and VOUT-2 provide each adjacent pair of voltage levels to the circuit., 273842=In step 1088, the output drivers 1 1056 and 2 1058 output the voltages corresponding to the symbols \u201c01\u201d and \u201c11\u201d, and the passgate pairs 1060, 1062 output the midpoint voltage VX. In step 1090, the comparator 1054 compares the midpoint voltage VX to the selected reference voltage VREFM. When the midpoint voltage is not within one least significant bit of the reference voltage VREFM, as described above with respect to VREFL0, in step 1092, the state machine 1064 augments the second set of current control bits CCB by one and the process repeats at step 1086., 271066=In step 1080, the output drivers 1 and 2 output the voltages corresponding to the symbols \u201c00\u201d and \u201c01\u201d and the midpoint voltage VX is generated. In step 1082, the comparator 1054 compares the midpoint voltage VX to the selected reference voltage VREFL0. When the midpoint voltage is within one least significant bit of the reference voltage VREFL0, the first set of current control bit have the proper setting. The state machine 1058 determines that the midpoint voltage VX is within one least significant bit of the reference voltage VREFL0 when the current control bits begin to oscillate between two settings. In other words, the output of the comparator will alternate between a zero and a one., 249775=In FIG. 33A, a 4-PAM output driver 1000 corrects for gds distortion. For simplicity the current control bits are not shown. The gds distortion is eliminated by adjusting the width to length (W/L) ratio of transistors 1002, 1004, and 1006 by factors \u03b1 and \u03b2 such that \u03b2>\u03b1>1 and the incremental voltage difference between adjacent 4-PAM levels is constant. Transistors 1002, 1004 and 1006 have a width to length ratio of W/L, \u03b1(W/L) and \u03b2(W/L), respectively. For example, input signals A, B, and C are derived from the MSB and LSB of a signal to be transmitted to produce the 4-PAM levels as shown in Table 2 below. This output driver uses combinational logic 1007 to produce the A, B, and C inputs according to the data bits to be transmitted., 282587=The output B from the MSB receiver 1112C represents the MSB. To decode the LSB, the signals from the comparator outputs B, A, and C are then passed through combinational logic 1138. The combinational logic 1138 decodes Gray coded signals as shown in Table 2 above. The 4-PAM input receiver incurs additional clock-to-output latency because of the combinational logic 1138., 279670=In the LSB receiver 1114A, the LSB preamplifier 1123 compares the input voltage VIN to the reference voltages VREFL0 and VREFL1 prior to integration. The LSB preamplifier 1123 receives the input voltage VIN and provides two pairs of differential output voltages VPDATA and VPDATAB, and VNDATA and VNDATAB, during each phase of the clock cycle for the even and odd LSB integrators 1124. The LSB integrators 1124 and LSB sense amplifiers 1125 are the same as the MSB integrators 1121 and MSB sense amplifiers 1122, respectively, described above., 321909=Referring back to FIG. 41, in an alternate embodiment, the even and odd mode integrating receivers for the control 1452 and data path 1455 share a single a single preamplifier. In another alternate embodiment, no preamplifier is used as shown in FIG. 42., 308914=Referring back to FIG. 47, a first current-steering transistor pair 1332, 1334 provides a path for current i from the current source 1336 to flow to integration nodes A and B and a second current-steering transistor pair 1338, 1340 provides a path for current i from current source 1342 to flow to capacitive elements 436, 438 connected to integration nodes A and B, respectively. The capacitive elements 436, 438 were described above. An additional current source 1344 provides current i to node B via transistor 1346 which is biased on by voltage VREFL1. A precharge circuit 460, discussed above with respect to FIG. 11B, precharges integration nodes A and B to ground., 271893=In step 1084, when the midpoint voltage VX is not within one least significant bit of the reference voltage VREFL0, the state machine 1064 augments the first set of current control bits depending on the result of the comparison. The term \u201caugment\u201d is used to indicate either incrementing or decrementing the current control bits. The process proceeds to step 1080.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with reference to certain preferred versions thereof, other versions are possible. Therefore, the spirit and scope of the appended claims should not be limited to the description of the preferred versions contained herein. Receiver testing may be done by individually measuring the six eyes and comparing each of them to timing and voltage criteria. As shown in FIG. 60B, after determining the \u201ceye\u201d for each transition, the corresponding eye patterns are overlayed (e.g., logically ANDed together) to generate the overall device performance characteristics. Testing determines the range of transmission voltages and signal transition times for which the device under test can successfully receive data and compares this region to some voltage and timing criteria appropriate for the system. Receiver testing may be done by repeatedly sending data to the device under test using different transmission voltages and signal transmission times and measuring the region for which transmission was successful. As shown in FIG. 60A, a 4-PAM signal has six possible distinct, 2-PAM transitions. Each of these transitions will have its own \u201ceye\u201d pattern. Conventional digital testing involves the use of 2-PAM signals, so a means for evaluating Multi-PAM signals must be devised. A 2-PAM signal may be characterized by its \u201ceye\u201d diagram. The \u201ceye\u201d diagram represents the ranges of transmission voltages and signal transmission times for which data transmission is successful. The width of each",
