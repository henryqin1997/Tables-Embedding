    "textBeforeTable": "(The Star San Marino - A blast from the past with a new age twist. The vintage Roc that started it all meets Innova's high tech Star plastic to form the Star San Marino Roc.) Speed 4, Glide 4, Turn 0, Fade 3 It is a great choice for an experienced player's utility disc, hyzer shots, anhyzer shots, turnover shots when worn, sidearm approaches, and players who like to carry several versions of the same disc in various states of wear. It's the number one professional mid range disc. It is very reliable at the high speeds that pros throw. It ages slowly, becoming an excellent slow turning disc as it wears. The Innova Roc is simply the best, most versatile mid range driver Innova makes. It provides accuracy at any range. This disc can take and hold the angle of release, even into a headwind. It can be used for driving, upshots, straight shots, hyzer shots or anhyzers. The Roc ages gradually and predictably, becoming an excellent slow turning disc as it wears. If you\u2019re not sure what golf disc to throw, choose the Roc, just like most of the Innova Pros that have at least one if not 4 or 5 Rocs in their bag. It is the preferred mid range disc golf disc for 12 time World Champion, Ken Climo. It is a larger diameter, 21.7 cm disc. Innova Star Rancho ROC - new in May 2012. The Star Rancho Roc was previously reserved for fundraising",
    "textAfterTable": "\"San Marino and Ontario Rocs are the heart of my game for controlled turnover and straight approach shots.\" - Stan McDaniel \"The Ontario mold is my Roc of choice. I prefer the O-Roc's glide and stability over the San Marino & Rancho. The DX runs have been great lately as well, producing a nice, stout feel at 4 (or so) grams off max.\" - Gregg Hosfeld \"The KC Pro Roc is my go to disc. I have the most confidence with it, and tend to use it in high pressure situations more often than not. It has a predictable flight that I can rely on for both finesse approach shots as well as tight drives off the tee. I'd suggest Roc to any player looking for a reliable disc that can be utilized in almost any scenario.\" - Brian Giggey \"The best mid range driver in disc golf, if you don\u2019t throw one you're missing out. I use this disc for longer range approaches & upshots to the basket. It has great control and accuracy which makes it a great choice for medium length drives off the tee. This has been the mid-range disc of choice for a majority of World Champions in the last 20 years.\" - Avery Jenkins Compared to the Roc, If you are looking for a disc with more Fade, try the Viper more Turn, try the Super Stingray more Glide, try the Mako",
