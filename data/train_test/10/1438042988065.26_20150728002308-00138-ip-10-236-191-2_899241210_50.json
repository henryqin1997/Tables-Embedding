            "The campus safety at CBU is unbelievably excellent. Security officers will even come assist students at any time of night to give them rides to their prospective living areas. Emergency buttons are placed in strategic areas around campus that will assure the person sending the alert that help is on its way.",
            "There are many different clubs available at Cal Baptist that enable students to learn, along with their fellow students and professors, on the subject of what they are passionate about through discussions and hands on activities. The academic clubs also often allow students to work with professionals in their field so that they can be better prepared for entering the work force. Clubs catered to more leisurely activities such as the cooking club also allow for fellowship while learning fun cooking ideas. Activities offered at CBU are, intramural sports, Christian Challenge meetings, and on campus concerts.",
            "This University is wonderful for a student who enjoys learning about their selected field, while having an incredible community environment and countless student activities to participate in on a daily basis. Students who want to grow and develop as individuals and understand more about how they play into the picture of this world will enjoy the many opportunities provided. Those who want to grow in their faith in Christ, or even learn more about Him and how to integrate Christian principles into one's lifestyle will love this school.",
            "We have a Great Commission globe at the front of the school that students touch before leaving on service projects, at the time of arriving at school, and the day of graduation. We also have a fountain called Fortuna and she is a goddess that was placed there before the University existed. Our annual intramural football game is named after her. We also have a tradition not to walk on the seal of our school in Stamps Court Yard in order to preserve lancer pride.",
            "CBU is an expensive school to attend, but you really do get bang for the buck. The experience of being a college student here will be irreplaceable. Students will learn more about themselves and how they can make a difference in their work places and community through a Christian perspective. Students at Cal Baptist will learn so much about their chosen field and be prepared to enter the work force when finished with their education.",
            "Because CBU is only about an hour or so away from the mountains or the beach, many fun activities are available to a student. Surfing, snowboarding, and hiking are very popular among students here. We also have a great game room with a pool table, foosball, and ping pong. Our school also offers great intramural sports like volleyball, flag football, and basketball.",
            "Our Alumni Dining Commons is an amazing place to dine because we have so many options to pick from. There are usually five different options for a main course, a salad bar, ice cream, fountain drinks, a waffle maker, and other deserts. Our Sunday brunch is the best and people from the community come to our dining area just to eat our delicious food. CBU also offers food on-the-go at a restaurant called Brisco's. Here, students are able to grab a sandwich, salad, or other boxed meals to go or to eat with friends at a nice outdoor/indoor area. Night time snacks can also be purchased here through the meal plans and can be enjoyed by a community building fire pit.",
            "Dorm life is wonderful at CBU. Hall events and dinners with those who live near you help create a great community for all. The residential advisors even take your schedule, desired areas of study, and sport involvement into consideration for roommate selection. The RAs on staff are always very helpful, responsible and set a great example for the freshman that live in the dorms. They can be contacted at any time and are always ready to be of help. After the freshman year, students live in apartments on campus which also offer a wonderful community environment. Events like coffee houses or worship nights help to bring the student body closer together. Friends are very easy to make at CBU and most people are very welcoming and inclusive.",
            "Our school is challenging academically, but not so much that one does not have a social life. Our teachers grade fairly and are very interested in being a key part in a student's success in life. They care about students as individuals and because our classes are not too big, students have personal attention for questions they may have for their teacher. If one applies themselves here, they will likely succeed.",
            "I would tell a prospective student to explore our Music Program because many opportunities are given through it such as performing weekly for the community through one of our touring large choirs or vocal small groups. I would also encourage anyone to seek out our International Service Projects which provide opportunities for students to help the less fortunate in other nations and be a blessing to them. Also, our school offers a major for almost any area of study desired. In addition, our athletic program is thriving in the NCAA division.",
            "California Baptist University will exceed any student's expectations in so many areas. It offers many opportunities for growth in countless areas of study, preparing all for the work force they will soon be a part of. The campus is very beautiful and its location caters to many exciting activities."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{129352=the classes here are great. they the teacher to student ratio is about 1:21 but it is actually a lot smaller if i might add. i had one class with only 6 students! and trust me that is awesome. it might depend on the major you are also, but so far i have had only one class that was somewhat large and that was a general education class that is popular on campus, it is called marine science., 198016=Best college cafeteria food ever. Sunday brunch is to die for. People actually come from off campus to eat in out cafeteria. There is also a restaurant called Briscios that offers sandwiches, and salads. There is a new restaurant opening fall 2012 that is going to offer different types of pasta. All of these are options that use the meal plan., 94607=The facilities, classes, professors, food, student body, and the school itself are all fantastic. There are buildings that are still standing from when the school was founded in 1954, but they are all standing strong, and are diligently maintained. In addition to buildings that were there originally, California Baptist University has purchased much of the land around it, and continues making renovations on existing buildings, as well as recently built facilities, and buildings that are being constructed., 463048=On campus, one can visit the game room and play ping pong, pool, shuffleboard, or Foosball. There is also a recreational center being built which will have workout equipment, a pool, an above ground track, a rock climbing wall, and much more. This is projected to open in the spring of 2013., 39258=Woo fest, March Madness and the Man Auction are all great traditions and so much fun to participate in!, 246543=The CBU crazies march during homecoming, there are several cool spots too! For example, there is the fortuna fountain, the catacombs( unfortunately you cannot go down in them) and the front lawn in general is nice., 658978=There are many events on campus for the residence and commuter students. If any events are coming up there will be posters around campus, people will tell you during Chapel, your RA will post things in the living area and you can check lancermail to see what is going on. There are service events to help out the community and hang out with friends. During September we have TWIRP week were the girl ask the boys on dates the entire week. Also have midnight madness, christmas chapel and etc. Next semester we have WOO! same as TWIRP but instead the boys ask the girls and woo there affection. Just a munch of events to connects everybody together and meet new people., 25803=There are tons of fun things to do on campus at any given moment. I enjoy spending my free time playing Futsol(street soccer) with friends or having late night jam sessions with my band, or even just kicking back and watching a movie at amc with a 7$ ticket bought from campus life. Oh and did i mention that the mountians and beach are only 45 min away? Wooo! 4:1 ratio!, 322308=A very friendly environment. The staff as been awesome in helping me along the way for the 2012-2013 school year. I'm so excited for what the future has for me at cbu., 533345=Despite it's hefty price tag, I've only have had to pay 1200 out of my own pocket. I feel like I'm paying for Cal State tuition. :) Which is a plus. However, make sure you're able to pay for 2/3 of the tuition. If you end up having to pay for more than $10,000 through your own pocket, and loans, do not attend Cal Baptist. You'd be better attending another college or university. Also, only take out Federal Subsidized loans (and not even a single unsubsidized loan). Private loans will haunt you if you take them out. Believe the horror stories you read about those taking out private loans., 255431=They do TONS of free and fun stuff. On November 1st to kick off Homecoming they were able to get Switchfoot to come and gave out like 600 FREE TICKETS!!! AND!! The concert was in our very own gym! And for midnight madness instead of just regular tickets they gave out CBU watches., 23013=No frats sorry, but tons of great clubs! Baking club for example............4:1 ratio!, 734003=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Tips for prospective students Be prepared to study, write papers, and read more than you ever have before. Throughout my previous years in school I maintained a high grade point average, but I still have to work very hard to maintain such a high GPA in college. Do your best to get involved in at least one sport, club, or bible study group. The friendships, memories, and values you'll gain are life-changing and it will make you feel home away from home. Bang for the buck I will admit that CBU is very expensive, but so is every other private university. The christian environment, caring professors, and lifelong friendships you'll make guarantee that the high cost of enrolling at CBU is truly worth every penny! Am enjoying being here I am still amazed everyday at how much of a blessing it is to be attending CBU and to be able to live on campus. The faculty is so friendly and helpful. Even my professors truly care about my grade and they strive for me to succeed. The professors really care about you as a person and they are available to help with school or even things that aren't school-related. I love my school and I can't imagine being anywhere",
