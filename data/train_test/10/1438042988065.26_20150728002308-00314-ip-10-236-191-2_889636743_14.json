Bang for the buck This is a private college and it's pretty expensive. Am enjoying being here I'm really glad I came to Mount Ida, it's a small school but I have a lot of friends and I'm really involved. Am learning a lot I love it here at Mount Ida and being in the graphic design major is awesome!!
