Maguire, who played all of the first quarter for the gold team as well as some of the second quarter, was probably the best quarterback on the field during the first half. His best play was a 27-yard dart to Rashad Gholston for a touchdown in the first quarter. Rush Offense:\u00a0There wasn't much to Florida State's rushing game in the first half.
