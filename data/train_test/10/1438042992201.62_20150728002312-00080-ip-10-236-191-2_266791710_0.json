Always a marginal seat, Kingston changed hands in 1966, 1969, 1975, 1983, 1996 and 1998. It was the seat contested by former Australian Democrats Leader Janine Haines in 1990. Held by former Labor Minister Gordon Bilney (1983-96), he was defeated in 1996, but after one term in the hands of Liberal Sue Jeanes, it reverted back to Labor in 1998. It was Labor's only gain in South Australia at an election where Labor needed to make many more gains in the state.

Assessment The closure of the Mitsubishi engine plant at Lonsdale within Kingston, and the fate of the Mitsubishi car assembly plant at Tonsley Park in neighbouring Boothby.
