It is also understood that the raised surface 28a can take various sizes and shapes as long as it functions to conduct heat away from the computer. Also, the bottom plate 28 and/or the raised surface 28a can be designed to translate normal to the bottom plate of the computer to and from an extended position in which it engages the computer when the computer is in place, and a retracted position during insertion and removal of the computer 36. In the latter situation, a lever mechanism can be provided to \"lock\" the computer in its docked position in a conventional manner, and according to the present invention, this mechanism would be designed to also move the bottom plate 28 and/or the raised portion 28a upwardly when the computer is locked in, and downwardly when the computer is unlocked. It is understood that the present invention is not limited to a docking station built around a port replicator but rather could be a full featured station or VCR styled docking station. Also, the particular design of the docking station 10 can be varied as long as it permits contact of the raised surface 28a of the heat sink assembly",
