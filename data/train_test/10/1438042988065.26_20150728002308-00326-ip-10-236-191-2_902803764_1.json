            "Apply, pay, and make sure you have all paper work filled out far ahead of time! Sometimes the way you are notified that you still have things to do before you are signed up for classes or registered is confusing. Take time to enjoy the scenery. The Lakeside Dining Hall may be cheap and all you can eat, but unless you want hamburgers, pizza, and salad all the time, check the menu before you pay.",
            "Clayton State is a cheaper community college, so it seems cheaper than other schools. For someone trying to save their money though, even between 1000 and 2000 dollars for 2 or 3 classes can be expensive. I am learning a lot though and do not have to travel far to go to school.",
            "Clayton State has a beautiful campus, except when it storms! The staff is always willing to help, whether teachers, the HUB (computer support), advisors, or any other department. I don't like having to pay so many fees for services I don't use when I pay for classes. The fees make up a lot of the bill.",
            "I have a high school diploma, so some information that others are learning is review for me. All my classes teach new material and the teachers, for the most part, are very helpful."

The freedom of college is WONDERFUL! But it can get in the way. Nobody is there to tell you what to do and when to do it. You're completely grown by college. Just stay focus. Don't party too much! But enjoy your college life! Bang for the buck Clayton State is extremely cheap. Aim for the Hope Scholarship as an extra assistance. But you are able to pay for the tuition with or without small scholarships. Am enjoying being here Clayton State was not my first choice, but I do not regret attending the University. It is a very nice, warm, and inviting environment. Everyone is nice and it is always something to do on campus. I absolutely enjoy it here",
