(Thursday July 30 2015), 14730=Pompey finally bring in Clarke (Tuesday August 4 2015), 36539=We promised you all a different Toast this week well here it is. It might have escaped some of you but today's date is 10th October or 10/10/10!! A very special date to all sorts of people - some will choose to day to get married, others see it as a life changing moment, a row of perfect 10s and the climate change lobby will use it to launch a 'cut emissions by 10% campaign'. So the Toast team thought as there is no game this weekend why not look at the number 10 and its place in Pompey history. We asked you in the forum recently to give us your favourite memories of the number ten too and we will use your input as always. Ten in Pompey history We start with the obvious Pompey's worst ever defeat was 10-0 at Leicester on 20 October 1928 - a sad day for all Pompey fans but a great day for football historians with all the stories of six swans flying over Filbert Street after Arthur Chandler scored his sixth goal. Chandler went on to tour South Africa with England B the next summer something that most record books seem to miss. Maybe the 6-1 thrashing the other week goes someway towards erasing that memory of that disastrous day, the strange thing was Pompey won the return at Fratton Park in April 1-0 and they scrapped clear of relegation troubles and were on their way to Wembley for the first time to play Bolton in the FA Cup Final. The score at Filbert Street the next season was Leicester City 0 Pompey 5!! Funny game football. Since 1945 Pompey have been involved in two games with ten goals. They were in November 1965 when Wolves won 8-2 at Molyneux a game I know John Milkins will never forget and in November 1995 when Oxford recovered from 5-2 down to 5-5 in the last three minutes. Perhaps strangely there have been three games with eleven goals. Shirts When it came to fans favourite player in the number ten most older fans have plumped for Len Phillips who wore the shirt during the Championship years of 1948/49 and 49/50. Number ten those days was worn by the inside left and Len later was switched to a wing half. Those older fans will argue but surely they are both midfield positions? Alan Biley was the choice of most other fans. The blond striker who scored a goal every other game in his three year Pompey career was a real hero in the early eighties and was always wore the number ten shirt. My choice could also be Guy Whittingham who wore the number ten shirt through the 1992/93 season when he netted 42 goals. 007 reminded me that my favourite player Brian Lewis wore #10 - which is true but he wore nearly every number!! Mick Tait did wear all ten outfield shirts in his Fratton career and 'Yosser' is real Pompey legend. The runs Four time is the last fifty years Pompey have made remarkable starts to the season. In 1967/68 and again in 1984/85 they started the season with ten unbeaten league games; strangely both records were lost in South London at Charlton and Wimbledon. In 2002/03 the ten game unbeaten start included a League Cup win over Peterborough and ended at Carrow Road Norwich. The 1979/80 season started with Pompey winning ten out of first eleven league games the other ended in defeat at Tranmere Rovers. Pompey scored thirty one goals in those ten wins. Goals Dave Dodson was a goal scoring winger who played two seasons at the club between 1961 and 1963 -he scored ten goals in each season!! The following list of players scored just ten goals while at Pompey \u0095 Noel Blake \u0095 Sammy Chapman \u0095 George Ley \u0095 Maitland Pollock \u0095 Fitzroy Simpson \u0095 Matt Svensson \u0095 Kit Symons And these played just ten games \u0095 Alex Cropley \u0095 Manuel Fernandes \u0095 Tony Macken \u0095 Ivica Mornar \u0095 Vince Radcliffe \u0095 Jason Roberts \u0095 Malcolm Shotton \u0095 Paul Wimbleton Lucky for Pompey? A bit look through the records show that in the last sixty years Pompey have played eighty two games on the 10th of the month. They have won thirty four and drawn twenty four. They scored 133 goals and conceded 103. Those wins included a 7-0 win over Everton, a 5-0 win at Preston and a Mick Tait hat-trick in another 5-0 against Exeter City. All in all not a bad day to play! Regulars will know that my shirt in the site journalists section at the top of the page bears the number 10. If I have convinced you that 10 is lucky, rush out and buy a lottery ticket and if you win, send me my 10%!! Toast hero We were all pleased to hear the news that Toast Player of the season for 2007/08 and 2008/09 Hermann Hreidarsson has agreed a new one year contract. Some fans had criticised the club for not signing him earlier but firstly he was overcoming a serious injury in a ruptured achiles tendon and secondly we are still only allowed a twenty players and places are precious. With Danny Webber already a long term injury and taking one spot they could not risk another. We all look forward to seeing HH back in action but what shirt number will he be allocated? The week ahead Big week for Pompey coming up. On Thursday the Football League meet to approve the buy out of the club and issue the golden share to Belram Chenrai. That would mean the end of Administration by 9am on Friday morning. Saturday brings the first Supporters conference held at Fratton Park at 11am. I will be there and a report of the events will be on Vital Pompey as soon as possible. Finally Pompey are back in action in the afternoon when Watford come to town. The Hornets have made a good start and the game will be a good yardstick as to the rest of the season. Are we really as good as we think we are?
