Examples of this type of work platform are those that are positioned and supported by a crane, hoist, or lift truck. These platforms are movable, but they are not elevating.",

Purpose of this guideline This guideline sets out the circumstances where a \"ship's ladder\" would normally be acceptable for use. It also provides guidance on the expectations of the Board for the design, installation and use of such a ladder. What is a ship's ladder? A ship's ladder, as addressed by this guideline, means a permanently installed steep pitched stair-like structure having rigid treads supported by rigid side rails, with handrails on each side. It does not include a ladder configuration made of treads or rungs supported by \"side rails\" made of fibre or wire rope. While the",
