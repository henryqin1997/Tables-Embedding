SANDERSON insisted on giving his crew fleecy pillowcases and sleeping bags, which he prototyped in his solo sailing experiences. The crew were initially unconvinced but have eaten their words now the fleece has come into its own in the freezing Southern Ocean conditions. SANDERSON jokes, 'The 1997-1998 race was famous for re-lighting the Code 0 sail; I think the fleecy pillow could be seen as one of the great breakthroughs of 2005-2006 Volvo Ocean Race.', 31091=For a complete list of all the news about the Volvo Ocean Race 2005-2006 CLICK HERE., 23184=Position Report At 1600 Hours UTC, 23 February 2006, 19293=The fleet very clearly made two decisions. Sebastien JOSSE's (FRA) ABN AMRO TWO and Torben GRAEL's (BRA) Brasil 1 opted to sail north around the top of the ridge, while the rest of the fleet headed south to race around the bottom of it. Currently the most southerly yachts have more breeze but the outlook for them is not very positive. Bouwe BEKKING's (NED) movistar, the present leader, tacked north at 0940 hours UTC passing in front of Neal MCDONALD's (GBR) Ericsson Racing Team, but tacked back east at 1240 UTC. At practically the same time Mike SANDERSON's (NZL) ABN AMRO ONE decided to tack north. SANDERSON's team crossed Paul CAYARD's (USA) Pirates of the Caribbean track at 1455 UTC making the black and red boat the current furthest south, 232 nautical miles from the ice gate travelling east at twelve knots.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Position Report At 1600 Hours UTC, 23 February 2006 Will Brasil 1 get a jump on the whole fleet on their homecoming leg, as this previously dubious looking tactic of heading north pays off? The outcome will be known in the next 36 hours. 'We're now sailing towards the ice way point that we have to cross on the way to Cape Horn. In the next 24 hours low pressure system will bring stronger winds and life aboard will change dramatically. The deck will be all wet again and really, really cold. Water temperature is already at a freezing eight degrees.' The Brazilians have been complaining about the cold for the past few days but as Jo\u00e3o SIGNORINI (BRA) pointed out today everyone was feeling the drop in temperature. 'Yesterday night we entered a light wind zone and sailing became really quiet. Inside the boat, temperature and silence are a gift for the off-duty crewmembers, who can sleep without the usual hard conditions. We know that this won't last long and everyone is making the best of these quiet times. Crewmembers on deck are already suffering with the cold weather and even some 'gringos' [who are not Brazilian] are starting to complain about it. Brazilian Complaints Brasil 1 is currently 280 nautical miles from the ice gate but only has three knots of breeze and making only five knots of boat speed. 80 nautical miles to the south east are the young guns on ABN AMRO TWO",
