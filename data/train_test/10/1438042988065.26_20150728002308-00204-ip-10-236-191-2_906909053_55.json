            "There is a very helpful ASG. Helping all clubs. The friendliest and most enthusiastic people that want to help the students.",
            "There are fun cafe socials that allow fellow students to talk about what they are doing. There are sports events from the college as well as open gym available. The most fun I have is being involved in clubs/chapters at Bellevue College.",
            "I did not eat there often but when I did it was very delicious. It depends on what you like but they have several available choices for food. As well as a wide cafeteria where people can come together to interact and socialize.",
            "There are no dorms. I do not stay on campus",
            "The student should try his/ her hardest at learning the material at hand, and asks questions along the way rather than focusing on getting an A in the class. The teachers are willing to help in any way that they are able to. Most are willing to take the time to help a student understand the information.",
            "Who ever goes to Bellevue College should get involved in club activities. It gives you the skill set of an actual career setting. Social interaction between fellow peers. Do not feel afraid anywhere you are at. Everyone at Bellevue College wants to help you succeed in life even with transferring questions.",
            "Bellevue College has given me the opportunity to become something more than a student. The college is helping me with networking career opportunities and with leadership skills. The college has allowed me to feel comfortable in the learning environment and it has taught me that no idea is a bad idea."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{285112=As someone who is paying for school on their own, Bellevue College is definitely worth it. All of my classes have totally been worth the money. On average I spend $1500 on tuition (for around 15 credit hours) and $200 on books, though I could find books for cheaper if I tried harder. Registering for classes is easy, and refunds on classes and books are available if you use them in a timely manner. Busing is cheap and widely available. I would recommend you take the bus or carpool if possible to avoid paying for a parking pass for lots that are always full. If you are an AP/IB student, this school accepts those credits that makes going through undergraduate education even cheaper. There are scholarships and financial aid available through the school as well. As an added bonus, an associate's degree from Bellevue College is part of a direct transfer agreement with Washington state schools that let's you bypass many 4-year schools' freshman prerequisites and move right on to the meat of your major., 133378=The Campus police here on campus are sticklers for rules. If you're not by the book, you get a ticket. They aren't even all that big on warnings either. So be sure to read all of the student manual before going about your business. The college has working lampposts ever 5-6 feet throughout both the main walkways and parking lots. So even when I haven't been able to get a parking space close to the front, I still feel incredibly safe walking around by myself at 10 o'clock at night. There's just nowhere for criminals to hide. There is a fire station just across the street from the main campus and a city police station just a few blocks north., 73259=great for students who plan on transferring. around $1400 per quarter (15 credits)., 57143=Absolutely! Who wouldn't mind having to pay only $2000 for 16 credit hours per quarter? The classes teach you so much and there is a really good level of student interaction within the classes themselves. The size of the school is such that you can easily reach your teachers and establish connections with your classmates in order to enhance your educational experience. Definitely get so much more than that tiny bill implies., 1845=Compared to what students pay at a university, here at Bellevue College you get the same education and level of classes for 1/4 of the price. As of right now personally, i am taking 15 credits and my tuition for the quarter was about 1500. Compared to a university it would be 10X that. Bellevue College is a great place for low income people that want an education as good as any other university but is quite affordable., 334902=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Campus Safety Very secured campus. Security available 24/7 for your safety! Just a call and they will be there. What to do for fun Attend an event, join a club, and socialize! Food and Dining The cafeteria here can certainly satisfy your hunger. However, one bad thing is they usually serve fast food more than healthy food. Dorm Life Engaging learning environment with lots of activities going on all the time. Academic Rigor Some of the classes, especially the core major classes, are challenging. Most of the classes at BC is very fun and helpful to attend. Tips for prospective students Be active in campus activities by joining clubs, programs, or just attending fun on-campus events. In three sentences Bellevue College is a great institution with a diverse student body and a very engaging learning environment. Login to rate or flag the reviews kinjal",
