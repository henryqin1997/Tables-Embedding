            "Everywhere you go there is either a campus police a camera or a emergency phone booth. I have never had any problems or felt uncomfortable living on campus or walking back from the library late at night. With the right precautions anyone should always take everywhere and the amount of security on campus it wasn't ever an issue for me.",
            "There are multiple chapters to be able to get involved with. If you want to make the best out of it you have to put effort into being apart of it. If you have time to be around your chapter and help with philanthropies, organizing events and just going out of your way to do something then you'll have an amazing time. A lot of the events are worth it too, like the philanthropies each chapter puts on to help an organization in need and the events you attend are spectacular. The sororities on campus are very well diverse and you really fall in love with the one you choose and the fraternities are very close brothers to each other and each are unique in a way. It's a great way to get a college experience in and keep it going after college. But the best thing I thought was if you have a hard time being away from home it's always great to have some people to fall back onto to help you.",
            "There is always people around campus trying to get you to join in on something whether its fliers for a dunk tank to raise money or a group trying to get a team together for intramural games. There is also always free classes in the gym to go do like spin, yoga or just go relax in one of the pools.",
            "I think its great for all types of students. out of state, in state and from all over. Its a well diverse school and you will find people that relate to you if you really look. It's not very close to the country so if you hate the city it's a little bit harder for you, and me. But it's still enjoyable and well rounded.",
            "There is a HeyReb statue on the east side of campus going towards the theater rooms and a lot of times it's said that if your feeling nervous for a test people will go over and rub him for good luck. I still have yet to try it, but it's worth a try.",
            "The school offers a lot of discount cards the beginning of the year they hand out to students a lot of people don't get them but I do. You can get buy one get one free on food near campus and cheap show tickets for shows like the BlueMan Group. Also, the best burger places are literally almost on campus and you will learn to save so you can go eat sushi a few times a month. A lot of the restaurants around school offer UNLV student discounts its awesome!!",
            "There is a lot of different things to do for fun. Depending on the type of person you are there is a four story gym on campus, free to full time students, and also offers intramural teams each season that you can sign up for. SO FUN! Around the school there isn't too much that is walking distance, but a mile away is the Las Vegas Strip. There is roller coasters and restaurants for younger students and clubs for 21+ students. But if your an outdoors person there is Lake Mead down the highway that is gorgeous and Red Rock canyon which is pretty much for people who don't hike to extreme go getter's who want a challenge. There is also Greek Life that you can get involved with to meet new individuals and join a close group of people to help you and be a pseudo family for you away from home.",
            "The Dining commons mostly used by the students in the dorms because they get a meal plan, but the food is pretty diverse. It has good quality food and is changed up everyday in different areas so you don't get too bored with it. There is also a good amount of places to eat around campus such as Starbucks, Einstein bagels, Greens-to-go, Subway and more. But also the campus is walking distance to students local favorite spots to eat.",
            "I'm not to big of a fan on the dorm life because there isn't a kitchen in the rooms, but they are quaint and spaced out enough that you and your roommate (if you have one) have your own space. There not super huge or anything spectacular but they really help you to get to know other students and make friends fast. Also, there is quiet areas so if you can't study in your room there are study rooms available that you can go into at anytime to finish your assignments. RA's are pretty good about helping you out with any situation you have and the buildings are monitored and locked all the time.",
            "As lower classman the school work is what I would say is an introduction to the college life. The undergraduate teachers are a little more lenient about what type of homework you are assigned and they try to make it fair for you to be able to complete the assignment. Sometimes you catch a hardcore professor that can really make it challenging for you but class mates are usually nice enough to help out or 2nd floor in the library is a tutoring area for every subject.",
            "If your looking for a University that is very diverse and offers a lot of opportunities in multiple industries to help you jump start your career early this is a great college. It's located in a great area to help you decide what you really want to do after college and there is always someone that can help you with anything. From tutoring in the library to reviews with your teachers they want you to succeed if you put effort out to try to succeed.",
            "Great atmosphere for students that are serious about studying and getting a degree. One of the top colleges for Hotel Management and has amazing variety of majors to offer. Has one of the biggest Libraries on the West Coast that does sure come in handy during finals week to make everything so much easier."

If you are an out of state student, avoid this school like the plague. However, if you go to a Las Vegas high school and qualify for the Guinn Millennium Scholarship, you will pay only 1500-2500 dollars per semester, which is far below average. In other words, if you are local, have that scholarship, and only care about getting a degree so you can go to grad school, this is the place. But don't expect to have a exceptional learning environment., 745531=Apply early! There are MANY benefits offered for those who apply to UNLV by February. For example, there are a lot of scholarships that can pay for most, if not all, of your tuition. Talk to the financial aid office about grants offered by the school as well as other scholarships awarded by the program you're majoring in. Either way, you will be able to have at least some of your tuition paid off at UNLV., 1058196=Excited to be joining UNLV to study hospitality management with a concentration in PGA Golf. Attended an excellent and well organized orientation in June., 27451=I am already enrolled at UNLV to begin my first semester in the Spring of 2011. I have many friends who attended UNLV for the Fall semester & from what I have heard, the classes are packed full of learning experiences. They require much work, focus & concentration. The professors are very knowledgeable on the subjects which they teach, & they are willing help if you get lost. Overall, students at UNLV undoubtedly learn a lot in their time spent at the university., 470645=I feel that they do not support their Geology program very well, There on-campus housing needs to be remodeled. They do not treat everyone equally I know this as I worked in the Enrollment and Student Services office and I was able to see what goes on behind the scenes. I rate them a 4 out of 10 I am currenlty finishing my last semester with UNLV online this fall and starting with Metropolitan College of Denver Spring 2013, 217404=If you are a commuter and willing to stay on campus until 6:30 PM for a meeting, once a month, then I would say the clubs are a great thing. To those living on campus it is definitely more convenient because they are within walking distance., 1060679=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 1023468=There's plenty of people on campus throughout the whole entire day. I have a class that doesn't end until 7:30 at night and there's still plenty of other students walking around campus. However, if there isn't a lot of people around, there are security guards constantly patrolling the campus, and there are emergency call boxes on every corner for students to pick up and it will notify campus police that they need help.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Everyone knows college isn't gonna be easy, its a challenge. There are going to be teachers that only go over the general information in the lecture, leaving it up to you to learn the concepts through the book. But reading the book is required in all classes. There will also be teachers that go more in depth in the lectures, giving you a full understanding of the material before you study on your own. But all courses will offer a study group or tutoring, which is helpful when you don't get anything. Some teachers may have really thick accents, but that will just be another obstacle to overcome. So before you decide on your schedule, I recommend you look up the professor on ratemyprofessor.com, the reviews are usually straight on. Overall, you will learn a lot here, but you're going to have to put the time and effort in.
